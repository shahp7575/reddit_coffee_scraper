","Does anyone have experience taking mini-vacations when things at work are slow, perhaps between cases/deals? I'm in a situation where all of my deals are in the post-close period and I haven't been assigned to another deal yet. I anticipate this very rare slow period will only last for a week at best, so I have been toying with the idea of buying the cheapest flight to a random fun destination and going on a spontaneous 3-day trip. I would be taking my laptop and my tri-screen extender thing in case I get some one-off tasks, but since I am in between deals I don't anticipate I will have to hunker down with 3 big screens and a gallon of coffee as I would when things are really busy.

So all that to say - has anyone done trips like this? if so, how did you pull it off? Any tips on how to enjoy the trip while still being available in case shit hits the fan? Any tips on how far of a distance is too far, or how long a flight is too long, or anything of that nature? Thanks!

1gcog5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gcog5g/im_not_afraid_of_rejection_but_im_afraid_the/,I‚Äôm not afraid of rejection‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm afraid the sheer frequency with which I get rejected could get me a reputation.  Can anyone relate and offer feedback?,"

So, I feel like when we talk about men that are afraid of rejection, it typically comes from this idea that it will emotionally hurt them if they get rejected.  And sure, first time I got rejected I went home and cried and skipped school the next day.  But after putting myself out there more and more throughout my late teens and 20s, I‚Äôve become almost numb to rejection.  Like maybe I‚Äôll get a little disappointed, particular if the convo goes well but she won‚Äôt give me her number, but I generally just shrug it off and try again.

I‚Äôve probably asked out around 1000 women in the past 3 years, with only a few dates to show for it.  I‚Äôll typically ask them out at places like concerts, clubs, coffee shops, & parks.  I actually get a lot of phone numbers or IGs, but they typically eventually ghost me before a date happens 

I am aware there have been times where I‚Äôve made women uncomfortable doing this, and I‚Äôm trying to find the line between putting myself out there, and being a creep/harasser.  I‚Äôm not doing things like touching women without consent, following them home, etc that would cross a legal line, but I‚Äôm self aware enough to see there have been times where I‚Äôve lingered in a woman‚Äôs area too long before approaching her, walked over from afar to talk to her where the time it took to do that could be misconstrued as following, tried to dance with someone a little bit too pushy at concerts (though not just grabbing them or anything, just a bit too much up in personal space), and opened conversations in situations where they were giving clear indications they don‚Äôt want to be talked to like wearing headphones.  I feel shame for these instances, but all I can do now is try to learn and correct the behavior going forward.

But while I feel like I‚Äôve done some awkward things in the past, I still feel the need to try to put myself out there in appropriate ways.  I just feel afraid that with the number of rejections that have piled up on me over the past 3 years, that I‚Äôll develop a negative reputation‚Ä¶ which makes me a lot more unconfident in trying to meet women.  I‚Äôm going on 30 and feel if I don‚Äôt keep trying, I‚Äôll die alone.  But I‚Äôm afraid that if I keep trying, I‚Äôll become a social pariah in my area.

We all (well, we most) think physical fitness is important.  But what do you actually do, and what would you recommend to someone as a sustainable plan?  I'm not any kind of superman, but I think I've got a pretty good routine:

  
First of all, I walk a lot.  About 20000 steps a day.  I would tell people to aim for at least 10000.

  
I do the OMAD diet, otherwise known as 23:1 intermittent fasting.  I eat one meal a day.  I eat whatever I want when I eat, but I don't take in any calories the rest of the day:  just black coffee and a little diet soda.  I cheat sometimes, but I keep track of how many days I cheat and try to keep it under 5-6 a month.

  
I do push-ups one day, and pull-ups the next, and keep repeating that.  Pull-up bars are cheap.  I do a mix of overhand wide grip pullups and underhand narrow grip chinups.  So other than my walking, I work out for about 15 minutes a day.

  
I consider myself in pretty good shape, although I'm BMI overweight, I don't have 6-pack abs or anything.

I'm shocked I have never thought to go to a Tea subreddit before today, but here I am for the first time. I got this gorgeous glass / silver carafe from the thrift store. The bottom of the stand says made in China. I used one of these as a child, I had a friend that would have Winter Solstice parties where we would use the least amount of electricity possible, using candles for light and the fireplace for cooking/boiling water. I saw this at the thrift store for $6 and was taken back to that time. 

As you can see, it's currently in the sink. I was a bit nervous it might crack or break with hot water in it, but I just boiled water to a whistle and poured it in over some Jasmine Green tea and it seems to be holding well. I'm going to get tea lights to place in the base as a warmer, and hopefully use this for my own NYE party this year. I plan to get a blooming tea that will be showcased in this glass carafe quite nicely. 

Does anyone here have experience with these kinds of tea/coffee carafes / do you know what they are called? I am shocked this didn't explode as soon as boiling water went into it but it's been about 5 mins and nothing has cracked so far. It's so hard to tell with very thin glass like this if it's tempered or not.

1gco63h,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gco63h/portafilter_blowout_delonghi_dedica/,Portafilter Blowout [DeLonghi Dedica],"This is a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things, but it's happened twice in the last two weeks.

I have a DeLonghi Dedica with aftermarket (Amazon) bottomless 51mm portafilter. I've used this machine and setup for about half a year without incident. (I did have another bottomless portafilter crack one of the ears mid-shot, which caused the portafilter to sag, and coffee to spray everywhere.)

What's happening now is that (presumably from vibration), the portafilter is winding itself loose (clockwise) and coming completely disengaged from the group head during extraction. This happens quickly and results in the portafilter shooting off to the left and spraying coffee everywhere.

The first time, I thought, ""Well maybe I didn't tighten the portafilter in completely (counter-clockwise.)"" Since then, I'm reasonably vigilant about making sure the portafilter is correctly seated and turned until it can't turn any more.""

1gco5do,https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreanWar/comments/1gco5do/hungary_in_the_korean_war_the_medical_teams/,Hungary in the Korean War - The Medical Teams,"https://preview.redd.it/mo0wajlq04xd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f3e422e1f8afea84ea0d95797d13d7a54895bd7

In the first part, [I talked about the first Hungarian envoy to North Korea led by the diplomat, S√°ndor Simics. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KoreanWar/comments/1gap63g/hungary_in_the_korean_war_the_first_envoy/)

Hungary was the first country from Central and Eastern Europe to dispatch a medical team to the Korean War, with more than 200 Hungarian doctors, nurses, and medical personnel serving in eight successive rotations from 1950 to 1957. On July 20, 1950, a group of 19 Hungarian doctors, nurses, and technicians left Budapest for Moscow, carrying medical supplies such as field surgery kits, bandages, and medications in 17 backpacks. A larger shipment with a complete field hospital kit and laboratory was to follow them. After reaching Moscow, they continued their journey, primarily by train, stopping in Beijing for a week before arriving in North Korea just north of Pyongyang on August 2, 1950, covering a distance of 14,000 km. The Hungarian team set up a 450-bed field hospital, where they treated soldiers and civilians alike. By August 10, they were already administering pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical care imported from Hungary. The hospital also functioned as a teaching center, where Korean nurses, medics, and surgeons received hands-on training. This mission was the first of seven Hungarian medical groups that would provide care and training in North Korea over the years. When the last Hungarian medical team departed in 1957, they left behind a fully equipped hospital and a trained staff.

Hungary's involvement in the Korean War might seem surprising, given its own post-World War II devastation. However, in the context of Eastern Europe‚Äôs Cold War-era international health structures, it becomes clear that Hungary's participation was logical. The medical missions were part of a larger Eastern European effort to provide technical assistance to fellow socialist countries. Hungary‚Äôs role in these efforts sheds light on how Cold War international aid was shaped by political ideology, professional priorities, and logistical challenges. The mission not only provided critical medical aid but also highlighted the socialist world‚Äôs approach to international health, contrasting with capitalist technical assistance programs.

The Hungarian medical mission was highly publicized in Hungary, framed as an act of socialist solidarity and a gift to the North Korean people. The mission also served as a form of propaganda, reinforcing the Hungarian government‚Äôs claims about the dangers of imperialism and the importance of supporting socialist allies. While the mission had clear political motivations, it was also shaped by the personal experiences and humanitarian commitments of the doctors and nurses involved, many of whom had lived through the devastation of World War II and sought to apply their skills in service of those suffering from the consequences of war.

The facility was originally called the R√°kosi M√°ty√°s Hospital, named after the General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party. Following R√°kosi's ousting in the summer of 1956, official documents began referring to it as the Hungarian Hospital of Korea. However, North Korean records consistently identified it as the 58th Hospital of the Korean People‚Äôs Army. In the second year of the Korean War, the Hungarian hospital moved back to North Korea, setting up in Mangyongdae, a suburb of Pyongyang and the birthplace of Kim Il Sung. Later, it temporarily operated in Hechun and Songrim, eventually settling in the city of Sariwon in the post-war period.

The mission faced numerous challenges, including constant bombings, extreme scarcity of resources, and logistical difficulties. The hospital had to be relocated several times, and the Hungarian team often had to make do with limited supplies. The extent of parasitic infections among the North Korean population was particularly shocking to the Hungarian doctors, who had never encountered such widespread health problems before. Despite these challenges, the mission made significant contributions to North Korean healthcare, laying the foundations for what would become Eastern Europe‚Äôs field of tropical medicine.

The hospital's establishment was funded through a nationwide fundraising campaign, with a target of raising 5 million forints. To put this into perspective, the average salary in Hungary at the time was approximately 1,000 forints (HUF).

# What was communication like between the Hungarian envoy and the North Koreans?

* English
* German
* Russian
* Later, some Koreans learned Hungarian.

Each doctor was paired with a Korean assistant who aided with wound bandaging, administering injections, and handling administrative duties. These assistants also served as translators.

Pak Hon-yong, leader of the southern communists, traveled to Pyongyang in April 1948 as part of a large delegation and never returned, later becoming North Korea's first foreign minister after the country was established. Many members of this group, largely educated in the South, had studied abroad and were fluent in several world languages. They eventually interacted with the Hungarian medical teams. A notable example of these well-traveled Koreans was Dr. Ri Kang-guk, the Korean director of the Hungarian hospital. By multiple accounts, he was a cultured, open-minded, and highly intelligent man who spoke excellent German.The Hungarian medical teams were shocked when they learned that in 1953, the hospital director had been tried and sentenced to death during the purges aimed at southern communists.

Another Korean who formed close ties with the Hungarians was Major Hwang Su-bong, the hospital's deputy director. He was remembered as a gifted organizer who spoke excellent German. Unfortunately, just 4 months after the director's removal, Hwang was also arrested, and his fate remains unknown.

# The 1st Hungarian medical team

The 1st Hungarian medical team, comprising 7 surgeons, 5 surgical assistants, an internist, and a political leader. Unfortunately, the building in Chungwha, 25 kilometers from the capital Pyongyang, lacked a proper air-raid shelter, and on their first night, the group's rest was interrupted by a bombing raid. They sought refuge in the basement, but the heat and suffocating conditions caused one of their Korean guides to faint. On August 2, the Hungarian medical team departed by bus for their assigned location, with two trucks transporting their luggage and equipment. Although the rooms of the building had not yet been painted, the former school was prepared to operate as a hospital. According to Dr. Kar√°di Gy√∂rgyn√©n's recollection, the hospital was quickly set up, with electricity provided by a gasoline-powered generator and water delivered at regular intervals by a tanker.

The new hospital facility was equipped to care for 500 wounded patients, with the first 250 arriving on August 10. A high-ranking official from the DPRK Ministry of Health recommended that, due to the advanced skills of the Hungarian medical team, they should prioritize treating only the most critically injured patients. By August 16, Ambassador S√°ndor Simics visited the hospital and reported that the patient count had already reached 460. During his visit, a delegation from a nearby village, including local teachers and representatives from youth and women's organizations, came to express their gratitude to the Hungarian doctors. They brought three boxes of locally grown apples as a gesture of appreciation. The spontaneous event deeply touched the medical staff, who saw it as a meaningful moment.

The Hungarian hospital was situated between two potential bombing targets, a railway station and a tunnel, making it vulnerable to air raids. According to Dr. Kar√°di‚Äôs recollections, trenches were dug to provide shelter for both patients and staff during these attacks. Due to the constant danger, many patients often chose to remain in the trenches. Dr. Kar√°di also noted that a large red cross was displayed in the hospital courtyard to clearly mark it as a medical facility visible from the air. Despite this precaution, on the morning of August 29, six planes bombed the area, destroying a Korean residential house just 20-30 meters from the hospital. Tragically, a Korean doctor and three Korean nurses inside the house were killed, leaving the Hungarian team deeply shaken.

Following the bombing, Ambassador Simics and First Secretary M√°ria Balog visited the hospital site on the night of August 31. In their report to Budapest, the diplomats observed that the doctors remained calm and composed. Four days after the attack, Hungary's main daily newspaper, Szabad N√©p, mentioned that a hospital in the DPRK had been bombed, but omitted the fact that it was the Hungarian medical team's workplace, reflecting the typical media practices of the time. On the morning of September 4, the hospital endured another series of attacks. During the alert, a wounded North Korean airman reassured the Hungarian staff that the B-29 bombers were targeting Pyongyang, not the hospital. However, the fighter planes accompanying the bombers flew extremely low, frequently attacking the hospital and its vicinity. Kar√°di recalled that the planes flew so low that the pilots' helmets were visible from below.

On the morning of November 14, as the Hungarian team prepared to depart from Jian and continue their journey deeper into Manchuria, they unexpectedly found themselves under an air raid, despite being on Chinese territory. According to Kar√°di‚Äôs recollections, Chinese air defenses successfully shot down two bombers, which crashed in nearby villages. Once the raid concluded, the team finally left Jian at 6 p.m., departing from the local train station.  At that time, Manpo, North Korea, was under frequent bombing, which destroyed the buildings housing the Chinese, Czechoslovak, and Mongolian diplomatic missions. It was inevitable that the Hungarian mission‚Äôs residence would also be hit, and indeed, it soon became a casualty of the attacks.

# The 2nd Hungarian medical team

Dr. D√©nes J√°nos, upon reaching Moscow,  was taken to a medical clinic for examination, where he was surprised to find that, contrary to the usual professional courtesy of doctors treating one another without charge, he was required to pay for his treatment.

At the Hungarian hospital, there was only one experienced Korean doctor, an elderly man named Nam, who led a team responsible for performing blood transfusions 15 to 20 times daily, using donors from the hospital staff. Once the transition was complete, the first Hungarian medical team departed for home on March 12, 1951. Just a few days later, about 70 severely wounded Korean patients arrived. The doctors sorted them by the type of injuries: upper limb, lower limb, abdominal, chest, or neurological cases. Dr. D√©nes took charge of those with abdominal and chest wounds. He recalled a patient who had two bullet wounds in his chest that created a hole clear through his body. Another patient had a gunshot wound to the abdomen but had miraculously survived the journey from the battlefield to Changchun. Unfortunately, most patients with such severe injuries died on the battlefield due to limited medical resources, and despite the hospital's efforts, many also succumbed to their wounds in Changchun.

[Dr. S√°ndor Lajos and Dr. B√°lint Gy√∂rgy from the third Hungarian medical team are traveling to their duties in the adjacent village, accompanied by Kim He Cse, a local staff member, positioned in the center. ](https://preview.redd.it/fhlrs3u684xd1.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aeb297c99ac1dd125b70e4742b3c7e216fffe41)

Despite the difficult circumstances, there were some encouraging improvements. A new delivery from Hungary allowed the hospital to replace all the bedding, providing patients with fresh pajamas and nightgowns. Wearing clean clothes, the patients started to take greater care in maintaining the cleanliness of their rooms. Dr. D√©nes observed that the hospital had risen to the standard of a rural Hungarian facility.

After rejoining the Hungarian medical team, they received a visit from an elite group of Chinese medical professionals from Beijing, including surgeons, urologists, and orthopedic specialists. The Chinese delegation stayed in Changchun only briefly, but their high level of professionalism greatly impressed the Hungarians. All members of the Chinese team had received their training in the United States through various scholarships. One of them introduced Dr. D√©nes to a surgical technique commonly practiced in the U.S. and offered him an American-made field anesthesia machine that had been captured by Chinese forces on the Korean battlefields.

Around this period, Ambassador Emanuel Safrank√≥ paid another visit to the doctors in Changchun and gave each of them 500 forints to purchase appropriate summer attire before their scheduled return to North Korea. Considering that the average monthly salary was approximately 1,000 forints at the time, this amount was quite substantial, especially when compared to the cost of goods in China during the early 1950s. For example, a complete outfit of Chinese-made clothing cost about 100 forints, and a pair of summer shoes could be bought for 30 forints. The doctors found themselves tempted by imported items like fountain pens and Swiss watches, which were available for around 240 forints. This situation highlighted once more the existence of capitalist elements within the communist regimes of that era.

# Biological warfare

When the Hungarian medical team returned to North Korea from Manchuria, they were assigned a new hospital location that was far from ideal. The two-story stone buildings in Mangyongdae were perched atop a hill, making them vulnerable targets for air raids. This concern aligns with Dr. D√©nes's recollections, who noted that their previous mission was nestled in a valley sheltered by pine forests. Envoy K√°roly P√°sztor also highlighted the hazardous positioning of the new hospital in his reports. He raised the issue with Health Minister Li Byong Nam and Commerce Minister Chang Si U, who was also the commander of the home front. They all agreed that while the site would be perfect for a hospital during peacetime, it was dangerously exposed during war. However, the North Korean authorities couldn't offer a better location, so the Hungarians had to proceed with setting up the hospital there.

Meanwhile, on July 12, 1951, the Hungarian hospital in Mangyongdae received its first influx of wounded patients, arriving both from the front lines and other medical facilities. Many were in critical condition, requiring six hours of intensive effort by the Hungarian doctors to stabilize over 50 individuals. As previously mentioned, the hospital comprised two main buildings situated atop a hill, with the ground floors housing the operating room, intensive care unit, X-ray facilities, and laboratory.

M√©ray Tibor, a Hungarian journalist, penned several articles that vividly portrayed the Hungarian doctors' work on the Korean frontlines. He highlighted surgeries performed amid constant bombings and the tragic scenes of dying women and children. While these articles accurately depicted the doctors' challenging conditions, they alarmed the families back home. Military surgeon J√°nos D√©nes, who finished his assignment in January 1952, also recalled that the articles caused significant concern among relatives. M√©ray's writings became emblematic of the Korean War period in Hungary. Eventually, his articles focused on the ""bacteriological war,"" accusing the United States of deploying biological weapons in Korea. This accusation was echoed across socialist countries at the time, although China was likely the primary source. Hungary's party newspaper, Szabad N√©p, first addressed the issue on May 11, 1951, publishing a statement from Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong. He claimed that General Douglas MacArthur had ordered the mass production of bacteriological weapons in Japan, stating that the Americans had spent 1.5 million yen on these weapons intended for use against the DPRK. Pak also mentioned that written evidence of this program had been captured by the Korean People's Army in Seoul.

The topic of ""bacteriological warfare"" then faded for several months before resurfacing in February 1952. By that time, Pak Hon-yong alleged that enemy planes had dropped plague and cholera bacteria in North Korea's rear areas. Two days later, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated these claims. According to M√©ray's recollection, he first learned about the ""bacteriological war"" on March 2, 1952. He received detailed briefings from the DPRK's Ministry of Health and was shown insects in a laboratory that supposedly carried the bacteria. On March 6, 1952, Chinese doctors visited the Hungarian hospital in Mangyongdae with dead flies that were allegedly bacterial carriers. According to the official report on the hospital's activities, on March 15, 1952, ""agents of the imperialists"" placed numerous infected flies near the hospital, which the Hungarian doctors found and burned.

[On September 12, 1951, Colonel Dr. Ri Kang Guk, the Korean head of the Hungarian hospital, received the delegation from the Democratic Association of Hungarian Women. ](https://preview.redd.it/9y8tg6xi64xd1.png?width=1347&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab3a41d5624f8d88e757dfebae8cfb2b53b0092)

During the winter months, the Hungarian doctors were accommodated in Korean farmhouses situated near the hospital. These homes utilized the traditional ondol heating system, which warmed the living spaces by directing smoke from the kitchen area beneath the floors. This method naturally heated the interiors for the occupants. On one occasion, however, Dr. Zolt√°n J√°nos recalled that smoke seeped through the floor into the room, leading to mild carbon monoxide poisoning among the sleeping doctors. The affected individuals were allowed to rest the next day and were provided with ample strong coffee to help ease their headaches.

The second Hungarian medical team's mission concluded in January 1952. All members, including Dr. J√°nos D√©nes, were honored with state awards by North Korea. Before departing, the team presented Swiss-made Longines watches to the hospital's senior staff (the director, deputy director, political leader, and the main building's caretaker). Other local employees received smaller tokens of appreciation. Finally, the team members left for Sinuiju in the backs of three trucks, while their female colleagues were transported in a Soviet-made Pobeda car supplied by the embassy. The group exited North Korea on January 27, 1952.

A Hungarian foreign ministry report from 1951 revealed that North Korea had 32 operational hospitals at the time. However, medical equipment was scarce: only 10 hospitals were equipped with X-ray machines, 18 had microscopes, and just 17 possessed operating tables. In light of these shortages, the Hungarian hospital stood out as one of the most well-equipped medical facilities in the country, providing treatment to many high-ranking officials and intellectuals of the era.

Plastic surgeon Dr. Zolt√°n J√°nos recalled a touching event that took place the day before he was set to return to Hungary. Major Hwang invited him to a spacious room within the hospital, where Director Ri Kang Guk and around 50 to 60 recovered North Korean soldiers were assembled. Major Hwang asked him to sit beside the director, who then gave an extended speech to the soldiers. Although the speech was in Korean and Dr. Zolt√°n couldn't understand it, he noticed the soldiers' eyes welling up with tears as they listened. He was deeply moved that these young soldiers, who had likely faced death numerous times on the battlefield‚Äîwere brought to tears at the thought of their Hungarian doctor departing for Europe

# South Koreans in the Hungarian hospital

As the conflict continued, word about the Hungarian hospital spread to the enemy side. Dr. Zolt√°n J√°nos recalled that South Korean soldiers occasionally appeared at the hospital after somehow crossing the front lines, seeking medical treatment for their injuries. This account was corroborated by another physician, Dr. Bonta J√°nos, who remembered an incident where North Korean security forces searched the hospital and removed twelve South Korean soldiers from the wards. A subsequent report from the Hungarian embassy noted that some South Korean soldiers ""working"" at the hospital were killed during a bombing attack, though it remains uncertain whether they were defectors or prisoners of war.

# The 4th and 5th Hungarian medical team

The fifth medical team reached the Taedong River where the Hungarian hospital was set up, utilizing Korean farmhouses and dug-out wards. Members of the fourth group greeted them; they were sun-tanned and wore North Korean military uniforms without rank insignia. Shortly after their arrival, the newcomers experienced their first air raid on the hospital. While performing surgery, Dr. S√°tori heard the whistling of approaching airplanes, followed by a sudden loud explosion. Despite the windows shattering, he intended to continue the operation. His 17-year-old Korean assistant remained calm and asked about the situation, wondering if it was an air raid. Inspired by her composure, he decided to stay in the operating room and complete the procedure.

Dr. √ñd√∂n S√°tori also recounted an interesting incident from his time in Hichon. The Hungarian team found an empty fuel tank, likely dropped from an American plane, which they cleverly transformed into a continuous shower. By drilling holes in the top of the oval tank and channeling river water through it, they were able to enjoy a pleasant and constant shower during the warmer months.

In the past, I've always just boiled water and put it on tea. Now I know that it needs to be at a certain temperature depending on the tea, and it needs to be steeped for a certain amount of time. The instructions for both teas are on the bags, but I'm just so intimidated! I want to drink it, but I just keep looking at the bags like O\_o.

The following Monday, I was called in to have a meeting with the sheriff. I could tell it was a serious conversation; there was very little in the way of jokes and jabs. Instead I was asked, politely, to sit down. I knew there was gonna be trouble. Sheriff Mason leaned back in his chair with a sigh.

‚ÄúHeard you almost got Nick killed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe ain‚Äôt happy about it.‚Äù

He tapped the answering machine on his desk. Who the hell even has one of those anymore?

‚ÄúMaybe we ought to deal with the deeper issues first,‚Äù I countered. ‚ÄúLike that thing at the school collecting heads.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think we oughta do something about that, huh? Well little miss krispy kreme, there‚Äôs a whole lot of sugar goin‚Äô round this town, and I ain‚Äôt got enough pac mans to gobble it all.‚Äù

He got out of his chair and painstakingly walked around his desk, sitting down next to me. I could smell the beard oil from his walrus mustache.

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt even scratched the surface yet. But you gotta calm down. And for you to calm down, I gotta pull you off patrol.‚Äù

¬†

Nick was paired up with a twitchy guy named Reggie. Reggie was in his early 40‚Äôs and had the shape of a badly drawn stick figure with a receding hairline. Apparently, he‚Äôd been working dispatch for three years, and now I was supposed to take over his position. I was to work on the phones back at the station for the foreseeable future.

I was put at a desk with a slightly newer computer, a headset, and a chatty coworker. The first time I met Charlotte, or Charlie for short, she was handling something I can only dream of understanding. The conversation went a little something like this;

‚ÄúSir. Sir! SIR! I don‚Äôt care how many arms you‚Äôve found, you put them right back where you find them. And don‚Äôt go planting them like trees, that‚Äôs disrespectful.‚Äù

¬†

Charlie was energetic; like a cooped-up parakeet. She had trouble sitting still and wandered back and forth whenever she could afford to stretch her legs. She looked to be no more than 20, maybe 25, but she was closer to 40 and had two kids back home. The only thing that kinda gave it away was her nails. You could tell she used her hands a lot.

She introduced me to a lot of the basic systems. How to see and handle phone queues, what to take down on reports, standard protocols, that kinda stuff. I spent the first few days just watching her do the job and then slowly getting easier calls redirected to me.

Now, while we were officially taking calls for things like tips and wellness checks, we also got calls from the DUC people that the sheriff was working for. We had simple instructions when dealing with them; don‚Äôt ask questions. We were to do as we were told, and if we couldn‚Äôt, we patched them through to the sheriff.

¬†

As March dipped into April, I was getting pretty good at it. I had effectively replaced Reggie, who I could see drop by the station every now and then with Nick following suit. I tried to talk to them a couple of times, but Nick wasn‚Äôt having it. Reggie seemed like an eager puppy, just happy to get some attention, so every attempt I made to patch things up with Nick got swallowed up. I brought in donuts? Reggie was happy to talk about it, while Nick silently grabbed one in the background. I refilled the coffee machine? Reggie was happy to grab a cup, while Nick filled up his thermos. Every conversation starter I tried got derailed.

It was one of those times that prompted my first real conversation with Charlie. It was a dull Tuesday afternoon in between calls. Charlie was busy trying to make sense of her kid‚Äôs schedule for the week, scratching her head as she scrolled up and down on a second-hand iPad.

‚ÄúWhat you doin‚Äô out here anyway?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou killed someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúMost folks that get here done do some dumb shit they can‚Äôt take back.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorta,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúBut I ain‚Äôt killed anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanted to?‚Äù

‚ÄúWanted to what?‚Äù

‚ÄúKill someone.‚Äù

It was a strange question to be asked so casually. I just tilted my head at her, giving her a questioning look.

‚ÄúLook, all‚Äôs I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô is that if you gotta get deported to dipshit nowhere, population whatever, you might as well get your money‚Äôs worth. Whatever you did oughta get you somethin‚Äô, is all.‚Äù

I shook my head at her.

‚ÄúIt got me nothing.‚Äù

Charlie lit up with a grin, leaning across the room with her knuckles out. I tapped them.

‚ÄúFucked if we do, fucked if we don‚Äôt.‚Äù

¬†

Most of the calls I got were completely harmless. Someone locking themselves out of their house. A worried neighbor spotting a dog in a car. I even got the cat stuck in a tree call once.

But there were a couple of strange calls too. Most of them came from the DUC; the strange men-in-black kinda people that sheriff Mason had called in at the start of the year. One time they called in to check if anyone had reported any strange aerial sightings. Giant birds or insects, stuff like that. When I told them we hadn‚Äôt had anything like that, they hung up on me.

I got a few calls like that, most of them harmless or nonsensical. But given the kind of calls we could get from ordinary folks in Tomskog, it wasn‚Äôt that unusual.

¬†

Things took a pretty drastic turn when I got what seemed like a harmless call. By then, Charlie wasn‚Äôt patching them through to me or routing them; we had a 50-50 split on calls. Gave her more time to check her Facebook. I got a call from an older woman that I‚Äôd never talked to before. I didn‚Äôt recognize the name, but I could see she was registered to a Tomskog address.

‚ÄúMy son got me eight rubber ducks for my bathroom,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúBut when I walked in this morning, there were twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what‚Ä¶ there are too many rubber ducks, is that it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I don‚Äôt know where they came from,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúI think someone broke in.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

I looked over at Charlie. Her ears must‚Äôve perked up at ‚Äòrubber duck‚Äô. She mouthed a silent ‚Äòwhat the hell‚Äô at me, and I just shrugged.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, unless this is some sort of immediate threat, I‚Äôll ask to see if a patrol can stop by to look for damages later today. Please take some time to check the locks on your windows, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù the old woman laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it sounds ridiculous. But I‚Äôve checked again and again, and there‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs too many of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll see what we can do. You have a nice day now.‚Äù

¬†

According to our systems, one of our units was available. Seeing as how there was nothing else to do at the moment, I tagged them on the radio.

‚ÄúUnit 115, this is dispatch, do you copy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNick here, whaddaya got?‚Äù

I was a bit startled. I hadn‚Äôt talked to the guy in weeks.

‚ÄúHey Nick,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúYou doing alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he cut me short. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the sitch?‚Äù

I explained the situation to him. He could barely keep himself from laughing, but I guess he figured anything was better than babysitting the Digman‚Äôs on yet another stakeout. So I got him and Reggie to check the old woman and her mysterious rubber ducks.

¬†

Now, this seemed innocent at the time. Just a fun anecdote. I spent most of that day talking to Charlie about everything ang nothing. She smoked at her desk, but she sat next to a window and was kind enough to tilt her head out when she exhaled. It was a nasty habit, but at least she smoked menthols. She loved the rubber duck story and had all kinds of follow-up questions about it. Her kids would definitely hear about it at family dinner ‚Äì guaranteed.

Then she got a call. It was probably three, maybe four hours after the rubber duck call. I could tell it was serious; Charlie put out her cigarette and leaned forward, taking notes. She was talking to the DUC ‚Äì they were the only ones who called in that Charlie never questioned.

As soon as the call ended, she ran up to the front doors and locked them. Then she started to go down the side of the room, checking that every window was closed and secured.

‚ÄúCheck the windows,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe gotta lock up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd they say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said they‚Äôd get back to us. But until they do, we gotta lock up, and nothing gets in.‚Äù

¬†

We checked every room and made sure it was all locked up. There was no one else around, just me and Charlie. It was that time of day when the sun started to set, freezing an icy sheet over the melting snow outside; giving a crackling noise to every footstep. Temperatures were dipping fast, and even inside the station we had to put on jackets to keep the heat up. The radiators hadn‚Äôt worked for months. I decided to power through.

The next call that came through was routed to me. It was one of the DUC folks ‚Äì you could tell by the extension on their phone. As soon as I clicked that receiver, the voice on the other end came through.

‚ÄúDid you secure the station?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, we‚Ä¶ we locked all of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to take inventory,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverything larger than a fist. Write it all down. Every single item, even if it is nailed to the wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gonna take hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôll have to take hours!‚Äù he snapped back. ‚ÄúAnd when you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôre gonna do it again! And if a single thing on that list is out of line, you call me on this number *immediately!*‚Äù

If it is one lesson I‚Äôd taken away from my run-in at the high school with Nick, it was to not stick my nose where it didn‚Äôt belong. This seemed like one of those times. I dry-swallowed my questions.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre getting overtime.‚Äù

¬†

Charlie and I armed ourselves with notepads and divvied up the rooms. She‚Äôd take the bullpen and front desk, I‚Äôd take the break room. She‚Äôd take the bathrooms, I‚Äôd take the locker room. Then we had two interview rooms, the sheriff‚Äôs office, an evidence room and a conference room. This was gonna take hours ‚Äì possibly long into the night. Especially if they were serious about us doing it twice.

I was halfway through checking the break room when I saw one of the squad cars coming back. It wasn‚Äôt Nick and Reggie, but two of the others. They stopped outside, gave us a curious look through the windows, and called out to me.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall doing alright in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúPeachy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some weird shit going on,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄúCheck if something‚Äôs outta place.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno,‚Äù they shrugged. ‚ÄúBut we got a stab victim who says the last thing he remembers is noticing he had too many radios. I dunno what to make of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get stabbed for having too many radios.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno what to tell ya‚Äô.‚Äù

¬†

¬†It was dull work. Dull, dull, dull. Charlie put on some of her playlist through the speaker system just to make the hours pass. I didn‚Äôt take her for a honky tonk kind of woman, but by the second Dolly Parton album I figured she wasn‚Äôt sarcastic. Noting every little thing, only to know I had to cross-reference it later, was exhausting. It‚Äôs one thing to have a lot of work to do, but to know you‚Äôre gonna have to do it again just drains you.

I was using a master key to check every locker, one by one. I was going on autopilot to the point where I was barely paying attention to what I was looking at, or who‚Äôs locker I was checking. I was humming along to ‚ÄòBackwoods Barbie‚Äô when something in my brain clicked. I was checking my own locker, running my hands over my jacket. I knew what was in this locker already, there was no point in checking every little bit of it.

But taking a step back, something didn‚Äôt add up. I shook my head, squinted a little, and looked again. I could see my jacket there; one of those brown pilot-like jackets with a ruffled collar. Comfiest thing I‚Äôd ever owned.

But there were two of them.

*There shouldn‚Äôt be two of them.*

¬†

‚ÄúCharlie?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúCome here for a sec.‚Äù

She trotted over, still humming along to the music. She knew every word by heart.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see two jackets in that locker?‚Äù I asked.

She walked up to me and checked the locker. She nodded.

‚ÄúYup, that‚Äôs two.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere shouldn‚Äôt be. That‚Äôs my jacket. I only have one jacket.‚Äù

We just stood there for a bit, staring at the open locker. I couldn‚Äôt tell which one was which; the jackets were identical. One of them wasn‚Äôt mine. Charlie was the first to snap out of it, closing the locker with a smack.

‚ÄúHold it shut,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the duct tape.‚Äù

¬†

We taped up the locker, just to be safe. Then we sealed off the entire locker room and retreated to the bullpen. I made the call to the DUC while Charlie called back home to tell her family she‚Äôd be running late. I got an answer on the first ring.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an extra jacket in my locker,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs that bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt put it there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did not put it there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs bad,‚Äù the voice on the other end sighed. ‚ÄúHave you found anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet, no.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSettle in one room, lock the rest.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

The question just slipped out of me. I knew better than to ask the DUC for clarification, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself.

¬†

There were a few seconds of silence. The voice came back a little lower, more thoughtful.

‚ÄúDid you have any coffee today?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that have to-‚Äú

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs relevant. Did you have any coffee today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, at, uh‚Ä¶ at lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you take milk? Sugar?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre feeling okay?‚Äù

I looked down at myself, as if expecting to see something unusual. I was fine, of course.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we can eliminate one factor. The most probable issue here is a flare-up of something that shouldn‚Äôt be here. Something must‚Äôve provoked them. There‚Äôs gonna be a lot of them popping up around town tonight, but if we‚Äôre lucky they might pass us by.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou make it sound like‚Ä¶ bad weather.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are similarities,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúNow stay by your station. We‚Äôre switching to secure channels.‚Äù

¬†

Charlie and I locked it all. Just to make sure, we taped the edges. We ran out of duct tape and had to resort to packing tape and evidence tape. Soon, the entire station looked like a crime scene. Charlie and I hunkered down in the bullpen; the room where we spent most of our time. About an hour later, the power went out.

It‚Äôs a strange feeling watching a familiar location through a new light. The bullpen usually had these sterile fluorescent lamps. I‚Äôd never seen the station in the dark before; these things were always on. Charlie and I checked our flashlights, sending bright beams swaying across the room. The speakers went silent, giving Dolly a rest for now.

‚ÄúMight be the breakers,‚Äù Charlie said. ‚ÄúI could go check.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think that‚Äôs a good idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúBut I *could* do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBet you could.‚Äù

We stayed put. When there was nothing left inside to grab our attention, we turned outwards.

¬†

We could see buildings down the street were still powered, so this had to be something local. Charlie was probably right about it being a breaker problem. Maybe a burnt fuse. But we were not about to test the DUC and their recommendations; we were staying put and waiting for the cavalry.

Time passed slower than usual. I was a bit worked up, and hours started to feel like days. Time was about 9pm when I snapped to attention as Charlie called me over. She pointed out the window, shining her flashlight on something.

A rocking horse. A red rocking horse, one of those old-timey toys that kids used to get. It was just standing there in the middle of the snow.

‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt there before,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd unless I‚Äôm missin‚Äô out on some TikTok prank shit, that has no earthly business being there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just a toy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù

We looked at it for a couple of minutes, shining our lights at it from different angles. Sure, it was just a toy, but someone must‚Äôve put it there. Toys didn‚Äôt move on their own. And that thought made those lifeless white eyes all the more menacing, as the wind slowly pushed it into a gentle sway.

¬†

Charlie and I tried to keep it cool, but I could tell she wasn‚Äôt okay. Maybe she just needed a cigarette. As the clock reached 10pm, she had to take a bathroom break. We didn‚Äôt know what to look for, and we had sealed off the bathrooms, but if you gotta go, you gotta go. I stood guard outside. A couple of minutes passed, then she came back out.

‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôm having a smoke.‚Äù

Following her back to the bullpen, she removed some of the tape from a window and cracked it open. The evidence tape fluttered in the wind, like a dancing ribbon. Looking outside, I could see that the rocking horse was gone. Charlie didn‚Äôt seem all too bothered by it. I started to doubt myself. I mean, maybe I was just looking in the wrong place?

¬†

Charlie cracked the window a bit further and lit a cigarette, leaning back in her chair. I sat back down at my desk, grabbing a couple tic tacs from the top drawer. But as I looked back up at Charlie, something tickled my brain. She blew the smoke right into the room. Last time she‚Äôd smoked, she‚Äôd leaned her head out the window.

She smiled a little as she noticed me looking her way. She raised her golden and white pack at me.

‚ÄúYou want one?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she nodded. ‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

She was still doing it. Something about her demeanor was different. I thought back on my locker, and the two jackets I‚Äôd seen. There could be two of something. Could that go for people?

¬†

I excused myself and made a hasty retreat to the bathroom. Charlie shot out of her seat, flicking her cigarette across the room.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù she called out. ‚ÄúHey, wait!‚Äù

I ignored her. I entered the bathroom, and as I did, I looked back at Charlie through a sliver in the closing door.

She looked taller. Her eyes had a tint of blue.

As I closed and locked the door, I heard a muffled laugh, then a couple of footsteps.

Then ‚Äì nothing.

¬†

The bathroom was just two stalls and a sink. Both doors were closed. I moved past the first stall, and stopped. There was a strange noise. Doubling back, I could see I‚Äôd stepped in blood; leaving red prints on the textured floor.

I opened the first stall door to find Charlie splayed out on the floor.

She was bleeding, but alive. She was clutching her chest and losing color, taking shallow breaths. It looked like she had a punctured lung. That would explain how she hadn‚Äôt been able to call for help. I didn‚Äôt even want to consider what this might mean, and what I‚Äôd just talked to outside.

‚ÄúTake it easy,‚Äù I said, getting down on my knees. ‚ÄúTake it easy. I got this. You‚Äôre good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶‚Äù Charlie wheezed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶you were already in‚Ä¶ in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt me, Charlie,‚Äù I assured her. ‚ÄúAnd that ain‚Äôt you outside.‚Äù

I got a plastic card from my wallet. An organ donor card, of all things. Charlie still had a roll of duct tape. I had Charlie move her hand from the wound as I opened her shirt. It was just a small puncture wound, no bigger than a pencil. I put the plastic card over the wound, taping the sides. That way air could go out on exhale, but would be sealed on the intake. That ought to give her some time.

I helped her sit up with her back against the toilet to relieve pressure from the wound. She wasn‚Äôt moving anytime soon.

‚ÄúWe gotta call for help,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt work.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôll work, what are you-‚Äú

I stopped to think about it. All emergency calls in this area was rerouted directly back to us. Usually I‚Äôd be able to call directly on the other units, but the DUC had changed us to secure channels. That meant a strict chain of communication, accessible to us only through the dispatch station. We could use our radios, but that would just patch us back to our desks.

There was also my phone. Looking through it, I realized I didn‚Äôt have that many numbers saved. I had the number for the sheriff‚Äôs office, and Nick, but that was it. I gave Nick‚Äôs number a go, but it went straight to voicemail. I figured he‚Äôd either left the thing in his locker or turned it off. Or maybe he‚Äôd blocked me.

There was only one real option to call for help. I had to get to my station in the bullpen.

¬†

Charlie was gonna be okay for a little bit. The bleeding wasn‚Äôt that bad, and as long as she didn‚Äôt strain herself she could last a couple of hours.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting help,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTake slow breaths. Stay upright. Use more tape if it gets soaked.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ took my cigs,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶ why the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMight be a good time to quit,‚Äù I smiled back.

‚Äú‚Ä¶never.‚Äù

I got out and closed the door. I got my gun, turned the safety off, readied myself, and left the bathroom.

¬†

There was no one out there. Holding my flashlight in front of me, I scanned back and forth.

‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs out there, you better let me know!‚Äù I called out.

There was no answer. Of course there wasn‚Äôt. Instead, as I rounded the corner to the bullpen, my jaw dropped. Every single window, and the front door, was wide open. Evidence tape fluttered in the crosswind. There was a whole bunch of junk at the far end of the room. A trash can, a couple of empty water jugs, a couple of speakers, trash bags, a pile of shoes‚Ä¶ just garbage, and plenty of it. There were a handful of items on the desks too that didn‚Äôt belong. I tried to keep my eyes on all of it, but there was just no way. It was everywhere.

I got to my desk and tapped the space bar, waking up the system. I put on my headset and briefly looked down to find the number for the DUC guy that called earlier, and with the flick of a wrist I pressed ‚Äòre-dial‚Äô. I looked back up as the first tone came through.

The moment he answered, I noticed that red rocking horse right in the middle of the room. There was no way that thing had just been there.

¬†

‚ÄúSomething got in,‚Äù I said the moment he picked up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs junk, like‚Ä¶ all over.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep your eye on it. Retreat to a safe location.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got an officer down,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSomething stabbed her. We need an ambulance.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got two units on-route. Can you hold out?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. We‚Äôre holed up in the bathroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet in, keep the doors closed, and wait for us.‚Äù

I blinked. The red rocking horse was closer. It was a full two feet closer just from the blink of an eye.

¬†

I jumped back a little. Luckily, my headset was wireless. It had shitty connection though; I could barely go to the other room before I got interference. There was no way I could get all the way to the bathroom without breaking the connection. But I had to try.

I backed off, forcing my eyes open. It‚Äôs one thing to accidentally stare at something until your eyes hurt, but to consciously think about it is excruciating. There‚Äôs no way. I could feel the salty sweat pearls on my brow grow bigger and drip down the side of my nose.

Blink.

Everything was different. The rocking horse was gone. Garbage bags were cardboard boxes. The empty water jugs were cinder blocks. The wide-open windows invited a howling April wind rushing through the room, grabbing hold of important papers and tossing them across the floor.

¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre acting on instinct,‚Äù the DUC man continued. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt wanna be where they are. They wanna be where we are. But they can‚Äôt be. They don‚Äôt belong. So they try to be us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means they can‚Äôt find a shape that fits them, so they try to take ours. They‚Äôre gonna be climbing on top of one another to get to you, and if they do, you‚Äôre gone. Your friend there probably just got a love tap. They tested you.‚Äù

My back bumped against the bathroom door as the connection broke. My flashlight flickered, and as it did, the lights came back to a different room. For a brief moment I was looking at a room of Charlie‚Äôs.

20, maybe 25 of her. All with the same lifeless expression. All but one ‚Äì the one with a pack of cigarettes.

In the back, a couple of them looked like me.

¬†

I threw myself inside the bathroom and locked the door. These things were fast. They had been at least seven feet away, but within the blink of an eye I‚Äôd felt something brushing against the back of my head. A couple of strands of hair came loose, slowly twirling to the floor. As I locked the door something slammed against it. Hard enough to make a point, but not hard enough to make the hinges buckle.

I opened the stall door to find Charlie struggling. She wasn‚Äôt worse off, at least. She had her gun up in my direction but had the trigger discipline not to take the shot.

‚Äú‚Ä¶oughta knock first,‚Äù she whispered. ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is‚Ä¶ private.‚Äù

I got in there with her, closing the stall door and sinking to the floor. I could hear them outside, digging through the rooms. They weren‚Äôt even pretending anymore, they were freely running about. When there‚Äôd been just one, they had to play along, but now there were dozens.

‚ÄúYou seen these before?‚Äù I asked.

‚Äú‚Ä¶seen all kinds,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶but not that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember you asking me about what I did to, uh‚Ä¶ to get here,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWho I‚Äôd killed.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you do?‚Äù

¬†

I said it a bit too loud. Outside the door, I could hear muffled echoes of my voice. A torrent of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôd you do‚Äô. They were trying to match my voice. My heart rate spiked, sending a cold spike into my fingertips as my heart struggled to remain calm.

‚Äú‚Ä¶fell in love with the wrong kinda man, but got the right kinda kids,‚Äù she smiled. ‚Äú‚Ä¶then things just‚Ä¶ worked out.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe with them now?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOr you got a babysitter?‚Äù

I was trying to keep her mind focused on something but the homicidal things outside that door, and asking about her family always seemed to brighten her day.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Keith passed some years ago,‚Äù she sighed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶never the fatherin‚Äô type to begin with.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry to hear that.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶the Digman‚Äôs are a shitty family, I‚Äôll tell you that.‚Äù

¬†

There was a banging on one of the windows outside. Someone was calling in. I got up and out of the stall, leaning against the bathroom door. It was Nick. It was faint, but it was him.

‚ÄúUse the fire exit, through the locker room!‚Äù he called out. ‚ÄúWe got you!‚Äù

I put down my gun and hurried back to Charlie. We worked out a plan. It was stupid, but it was all we had.

¬†

I carried her, bridal style, while she watched my back with her service weapon. It was far from ideal, but we didn‚Äôt have far to go. We had to try ‚Äì she was getting weaker. Besides, if Nick and the others were here, maybe they‚Äôd already secured the back exit.

Carrying Charlie, I bent down to have her open the lock. I counted down from three, feeling my mouth get drier by the syllable. The moment the mechanism clicked, I kicked the door open.

There were voices. Some mine, some hers; like a weird echo chamber. I didn‚Äôt look any other way but the locker room as four shots rang out, silencing a handful of voices from the bullpen.

¬†

I burst through the locker room door. There were jackets and garbage all over the floor, but I kept going. I could feel something sharp scratch against the bottom of my pants, like blunted knives not quite making it through the fabric. Charlie took two more shots as something vaguely human stepped out of a locker. I pressed on.

Kicking open the fire escape door, I expected an alarm to go off. That thing ought to have been on backup power, but something must‚Äôve been cut. I went straight out the back; an open area covered in crisp powder snow. To my surprise, I saw Nick. He was already there.

‚ÄúKeep going, I got you!‚Äù he said, pointing straight ahead.

He had his hand on his hip, ready to draw his weapon. I turned left, heading towards the parking lot, but he stopped me.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he interrupted. ‚ÄúStraight ahead! Just keep going!‚Äù

¬†

I followed his instructions for twenty or so feet, only to realize I was about to head straight into the woods. There were no roads in this direction, and there was nowhere to park an ambulance. Why‚Äôd he want me to go there?

In the distance, I could see two squad vehicles coming down the road. Number 114 and 115; the latter being Nick‚Äôs vehicle.

I turned back towards him, still holding Charlie. Without looking away, I whispered at her.

‚ÄúAre there pictures of the other officers down at the station?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶yeah, in the break room,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶from that one time we got a polaroid.‚Äù

Looking a bit closer, this Nick seemed a little off. His hair was longer. His eyes were straighter. And those shades were almost white; like they were still reflecting a light coming from ahead. His voice was a bit off, like the static of an answering machine. And the hand on his hip, well‚Ä¶ there was no service weapon there.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not Nick.‚Äù

¬†

I slowly put down Charlie and raised my weapon. Looking off to the side, I could see someone coming through the woods. There were footsteps coming from the other side as well. We were being surrounded.

Charlie wasn‚Äôt wasting time. She put four shots in the Nick-thing, and it ran screaming like a popped balloon back into the station. That shrieking noise had some strange cadence to it, grinding like a raw saw blade on my inner ear. It hurt to listen to, making me nauseous. Charlie put two more shots into something flanking from our left and reloaded. I followed her example.

We didn‚Äôt stop for anything. A cardboard box? Two shots. A barrel? Two more shots. Everything that was there, that shouldn‚Äôt be there, got tapped twice.

¬†

Then there was me. An identical copy of me, and what I looked like right at this moment. Only with a slight tinge of blue to their eyes.

It felt like looking into a mirror. She didn‚Äôt look angry, or threatening. She looked content, like she‚Äôd just stepped out of a shower. She didn‚Äôt run, she didn‚Äôt scream. She just casually walked my way, holding up an empty hand to show that she meant no harm.

Again, Charlie wasn‚Äôt having it. Two shots; chest and head.

The image distorted. My face grew long and disjointed as the back curled like a wounded insect. The arms shrunk into two dagger-like bone knobs sticking out of what would be the hand joints. As the jaw extended past her midriff, all I could think of was a melting plastic toy.

Then it, too, ran screeching into the wilds.

¬†

Something got a hold of Charlie.

She screamed, and by the time I turned around she‚Äôd been dragged eight feet. I couldn‚Äôt tell by what; there was nothing there. She had another puncture wound in her shoulder. She pointed her gun my direction, and I dove out of the way. She hit something that was coming up behind me. I crawled back to her on all fours, ending up back to back so we could check all directions at once.

She was barely breathing. I was having trouble breathing with two lungs, I couldn‚Äôt imagine what she was experiencing with just one. Her head was swaying back and forth like a bobblehead.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm out,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúI got eight left,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou see something?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶I dunno. Maybe.‚Äù

¬†

Another me, crawling out of the bushes at full speed on all fours.

Two shots.

A Charlie running out of the locker room, screeching like a wounded animal.

Two shots.

That damn red rocking horse, just eight feet away.

Two more shots.

A strange amalgamation came around the side of the building. It looked like someone had taken the picture of sheriff Mason and dragged it out. I realized it was probably trying to copy one of the blurry photos in the break room, as I could tell the vague outline of a birthday party hat; but it was all organic.

I just looked at it for a while, trying to figure out what was supposed to be what. A badge dragged out across the chest like an oval membrane, our blue and black uniform fabric; hairy like a spider‚Äôs abdomen. The face a hollow mockery, like a misshaped tree stump, only guesstimating the proportions of a man.

Two more shots, and it climbed back in through a window; a pile of strange colors and textures making their way back in.

¬†

Then, another Nick.

I raised my gun, and it clicked. I was out.

¬†

He looked down at me with this shocked expression on his face; his pink sunglasses almost rolling off the edge of his nose.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck, rook?‚Äù

‚ÄúNick?‚Äù

Without a second thought, he whistled. I could see Reggie bounding through the snow in the distance, along with two paramedics who‚Äôd stopped further down the road. I could hear sirens.

‚ÄúPut that shit away and help me,‚Äù said Nick. ‚ÄúWe gotta move her.‚Äù

¬†

It was a group effort, but we got Charlie to an ambulance. As more and more officers and DUC officials came back, I could tell everyone‚Äôd had a rough night. Reggie was busy telling his wife about his heroics over the phone; how he‚Äôd helped carry a wounded woman to an ambulance. Others were screaming over the radio to check other locations. Some were just looking for ammunition.

I ended up leaning against the hood of squad car 115, watching the station in the distance. It was getting cold, but I had a feeling I‚Äôd never see my favorite jacket again. Nick was sitting in the open driver‚Äôs seat, leaning out the door with a gas station hot dog in his hands. Seconds later, I could see men dressed in all-protective white, lighting up flamethrowers. They were dousing the entire station in fire.

Nick poked me with his elbow. Looking back at him, he offered me a candy bar.

‚ÄúFigured you had to skip dinner,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI get it.‚Äù

The silence settled. I could hear screeching in the distance as vaguely humanoid shapes ran burning out of the building. There were these popping noises, like wet balloons. I sunk my teeth into the candy bar, only to realize how dry my mouth was. I could barely taste it.

‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre moving us to the fire station,‚Äù Nick continued. ‚ÄúWe did that a couple years ago during renovations.‚Äù

‚ÄúGonna need a lot more than a fresh coat of paint for this one,‚Äù I added.

The roof caved in, as if to accentuate my point.

‚ÄúLooks like it.‚Äù

I looked down on my phone, then back at Nick. A thought crossed my mind.

‚ÄúDid you block my number?‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù I said, shaking my head. ‚ÄúJust checking.‚Äù

¬†

As the flames reached higher, the screeching stopped. The station was gone. Somewhere in there, my jacket was turning into smoldering coal. I wondered if things had been different if I‚Äôd just reported those rubber duck things to the DUC right away. The town of Tomskog can really throw you for a loop ‚Äì the slightest thing can mean the end of the world.

But you can‚Äôt be afraid of everything, all the time. You just gotta roll with the punches.

I'll finish up with some miscellaneous posts about Hokkaido, Kyushu and Hiroshima.

I had some of the best coffees of my time in Japan in Kyushu, so I would highly recommend going. It's also super beautiful, less crowded and has some excellent food.

This list is by no means exhaustive, it's just highlights. Please bear in mind that these are just my opinions as someone who generally likes very light roast, natural-processed African coffees and is not very into anaerobics or co-ferments.

*Hiroshima*

**Breath** in Hiroshima is Daichi Sato's passion project. It was just him running the shop both times I went: taking orders, roasting beans on a Probat and brewing pourover (V60), as well as espresso. He is super enthusiastic about his beans and will talk you through the origins and flavours of each bag (in Japanese), as well as offering you pre-ground samples to smell. I had a very clean anaerobic natural Ethiopian Benti Nenka that tasted like passion fruit gummies and a lemon tea-like honey process Rwanda Kilimbi. Strong recommend - it's reasonably close to the train station.

Of note, Obscura coffee roasters has 2 shops in Hiroshima which I would not recommend - quite dark for my liking, maybe try if you're into milk drinks.

***Hokkaido***

*Sapporo*

**Brewit by Node** is in the back of a restaurant or something - slightly hidden. It's a caf√© but hosts live music and has anarchist/Dadaist art all over the walls. The coffee is decent - I had a berry-forward natural Ethiopian and a Letty Bermudez extended fermentation/thermal shock washed that tasted like strawberry candy, albeit slightly astringent.

**Baristart coffee** doesn't do pourover at all. They specialise in MILK - for which Hokkaido is famous. They have a little map of all of the different milk origins on offer and how they differ in richness and sweetness. You can choose from a selection of 5 different coffees to have. I would recommend getting something hot to taste how the milks caramelise once steamed. Definitely worth a visit!

*Otaru*

**Coffee House Chaff** was a very pleasant surprise. A tiny little shop in a tiny little town owned by a couple who had to be at least in their 70s. They only do pourover and have a wide selection of roast styles - this always strikes me as a red flag, but in a small town I guess you have to cater to everyone. The 2 pourovers I had were delicious! A Costa Rican coffee that tasted like cranberries and a washed Kenyan that tasted like fruit leather!

***Kyushu***

*Hakata/Fukuoka*

Just to say that if you're in Hakata, the home of ramen, there's a big comfy **Fuglen**. I had a natural Honduras there 2 years ago that tasted like apples and maple syrup that is one of my fondest coffee memores. They're consistently good - though their ""filter coffee"" is generally brewed as aeropress (not bad, just for information).

There's a shop called White Glass coffee which is more of a brunch spot - the coffees we had were darker than I would like for pourover/EK43. Would not recommend if you like light roast.

*Kumamoto*

There's an awesome shop called **And Coffee Roasters / Brewers** (2 different locations)**.** **And Coffee Brewers** is located in the basement of a mall and is slightly hard to find. It was worth it though! They have coffee softo on tap, which was a slightly darker roast, but was still plenty light to be delicious. They also had some lovely coffees - predominantly African. We had 2 iced pourovers - a strawberry-forward Ethiopa Gotiti Natural and a washed Kenyan Mukengeria AA reminiscent of cherry cola with the classic tomato hit.

*Nagasaki*

**Kariomons** is another passion project. The female owner began to take my order in broken English but then became very friendly and chatty when I replied in Japanese. She asked me what origin and process I usually like to drink and asked if I would like her to surprise me - of course I said yes! She served me 2 pourovers on a Kalita - a washed Ethiopian Chire and a Honduras El Guaco Pacas Natural. Both were very clean - the Ethiopian more lemony and the Honduras like dark cherry. A great spot. They also do espresso.

*Kagoshima*

**Blue Beans Coffee Roasters** was another highlight of my time in Japan. They had a great selection of coffees, which you can choose to have iced or hot and either on espresso, Kalita or Origami with V60 papers! We had an Ethiopia Dimtu Natural (orangey then floral as it cooled), an Ethiopia Dimtu washed (fruity), a Kenya Nyeri (bright, clean and juicy) as V60s and a China Dehong Yeast Fermentation which the barista warned me to have as Kalita - indeed it was a pretty ridiculous lychee bomb.",2,1729957681.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1gco0ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gco0ih/keeping_it_warm_1_cup_over_an_hour_or_more/,Keeping it warm - 1 cup over an hour or more,"Hey there everyone - Here's my situation: I make a 225-250ml cup every morning. I occasionally have a second. I like to enjoy this cup over the course of the morning. When I wake up real early and drink my coffee while reading it stays warm enough in my favorite ceramic mug to finish... when the morning is more full of getting kids ready, checking in on work, school drop off, etc. I'm usually enjoying this cup over the course of an hour or more... Over summer I just let the cup cool and enjoyed the flavor changes from hot to room temp. Now that the temps are dropping I'm wanting to keep the cup warm over the entire time I'm drinking it.

What's your approach here? I thought about a thermos approach (but for a single cup seemed strange, brewing two cups every morning I think this would make sense). I know some friends swear by their Yeti mug, but some say they enjoy drinking out of the metal mug w/ plastic lid less than a ceramic mug. I've seen the electric mug warming plates, but I don't know how well those work...

I don't actually taste much if any taste shift from the microwave (which may be scientific fact, or an indicator my tongue is broken ;) so maybe that remains the best/easiest approach?

Thank you all",1,1729957659.0,pourover,3,0.67,False

1gcnvof,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gcnvof,October Trip Report,"From a long time lurker, thanks to this sub for helping me plan my trip! Recently got back from a week in Paris with family, and it was an incredible experience. Thought I'd leave some words here in case they could help someone.

Accommodations: stayed in two Airbnbs, one in the 7th by Rue Cler and one in the 1st on Rue St Denis. The 7th is quieter and more family oriented, but the 1st is very lively (Rue St. Denis is buzzing with young people every evening) with lots of restaurants/bars and incredibly well collected by metro. Recommend both neighbourhoods.

Attractions: BOOK EARLY. We had opening time tickets to the Louvre, Versailles and the Orsay and were thankful we did. At Versailles we sprinted up to the Hall of Mirrors as soon as it opened and got some great pictures. An hour later you could hardly move in the palace because of crowds. Same with the Orsay, get in and get right to the fifth floor for the Impressionist works before the entire city joins you. I also recommend a trip to the Philharmonie if you like classical music - we saw the Lucerne Festival Orchestra there and the building was beautiful, the music even better.

Tours: we did a river cruise of the Seine with Vedettes de Pont Neuf (recommend, especially on your first day before you've seen anything, but bundle up!), a guided private tour of the Louvre (loved it), the after-hours mystery tour of the Palais Garnier (highly recommend for the photo ops, as no one else is there but you - this building is stunning, more so than Versailles imo) and an audio walking tour of Montmartre with Voicemaps (really enjoyed it).

French Restaurants: I had done SO much research on French restaurants before the trip and had located at least 20 from the 1st to 7th arr. that were of interest. We ended up going to Le CasseNoix by the Eiffel Tower, Le Matre in Montmartre, Aux Perches in the 6th, and l'Apibo at Montorgueil. I can vouch for all of them, but especially l'Apibo, which was probably my favourite meal in France. Feel free to ask about any other restaurants! And don't forget to ask for 'une carafe' for free water everywhere you go.

Other Food: the best croissants we tried were at La Maison d'Isabelle (but they are good anywhere, walk into any boulangerie that looks busy). We got great eclairs at Donatien Maitre Eclair, although they were expensive. I got chocolate gifts at A La Mere de Famille and Jean Paul Hevin (really delicious), and also liked Alain Ducasse and Jacques Genin.

Shopping: I (male) got some great items at Balibaris, which was probably my favorite of the brands I visited. Good place for well made essentials with some style. For guys I also recommend Faguo, Monoprix, Serge Blanco, Celio, Jules for budget clothes, and Fursac, Hast, Maison Standards, APC, IKKS, October Editions for stuff that's a touch more high quality but won't break the bank. Can find a lot of these brands in the Marais or at department stores (Galerie Lafayette, Bon Marche). Tax refunds were super easy, just ask for the detaxe form when you buy and scan at the airport.

Language: I speak basic conversational French (I am Canadian) but I thought more people would switch to English when they heard me talk. WRONG - they only switch when you switch. Was surprised but it was a fun challenge trying to understand their really fast french and communicate in their language, and even got complimented by someone on my accent! I hardly spoke English while I was there.

Transportation: got the Navigo Decouvert weekly pass on our phones. Absolute lifesaver, save for the couple of times it didn't register and I had to go talk to an employee. Paris public transport is fantastic and will get you anywhere. We only used an Uber once (to move Airbnbs) and never used a taxi.

Random thoughts: Parisians are beautiful (I know, so shallow). So is the language they speak (I love French) and their city (architecture is unlike anything you see in North America). My favourite part of the trip was walking around, or sitting down with a coffee, and watching people walk about and talk to each other. Parisians are not overly nice or polite, but they certainly aren't rude and will help if you are nice about it.

I will have almost 4 full days and one of them will be a day trip to Lecce -- possibly two days. Perhaps I will also spend half a day to go to one of the nearby towns. I will not have a car.

\- Where should I stay in Bari (and Lecce)? I don't like being in a very noisy place and I don't like staying in very touristic areas. Just an ordinary neighborhood that's a bit quieter (normal noise is fine) and close enough to the historical things. In Napoli I enjoyed staying in Vomero but it doesn't need to be that fancy. Not interested in nightlife. Which neighborhoods would be best? Of course, particular hotels / bnbs are welcome, something simple.

\- Any suggestions for places to eat that are local and not at all fancy, more family places, with typical food?

\- What are the best typical coffee places for espresso?

\- I am bringing some work (reading and writing) and it would be nice if I could sit at a Cafe or library or something for an hour or two to work sometimes. Are there any places you would suggest for this?

 A debate about reparations for Britain‚Äôs role in the slave trade overshadowed a summit in Samoa of the Commonwealth, many of whose member nations were once British colonies.

Britain insists it will not pay to make amends for the historic wrong, but both King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the issue indirectly at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

‚ÄúNone of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,‚Äù Charles said.

The legacy of slavery is interwoven in some of Britain‚Äôs richest and most revered institutions ‚Äî from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd‚Äôs of London to the monarchy itself.

‚ÄúBritain benefited from transatlantic enslavement,‚Äù said Olivette Otele, professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at the School of African and Oriental Studies at University of London. ‚ÄúThe money and the money trail is there to prove it. So we need to have these conversations much more openly.‚Äù


Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, spoke of the ‚Äúappalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history‚Äù during a visit to Barbados in 2021. At the Commonwealth summit two years ago in Rwanda, he spoke of his sorrow over slavery and its legacy for Indigenous communities and said it was a ‚Äùconversation whose time has come.‚Äù



What was Britain‚Äôs role in the slave trade?
Britain got involved in the slave trade in the mid-1500s, following Portugal and Spain.

John Hawkins, one of the most notable sailors and naval commanders of the 16th century, is considered one of the pioneers of the English slave trade triangle.

Goods were traded in West Africa for captured slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to work in British sugar and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas. Goods produced in the so-called New World were transported back to England.

In 1672, the Royal African Company, established under King Charles II and run by his brother, Prince James (the future King James II), was given a monopoly on the slave trade.

The company trafficked 80,000 African men, women and children to slavery in the Americas and about 20,000 died on the journey before the monopoly ended in 1698 when any Englishman could trade slaves.

At its height, Britain was the world‚Äôs biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic.

When was it abolished?
An abolitionist movement arose in England in the late 1700s, supported by Quakers, a few politicians and some former slaves.

The slave trade was not outlawed until 1807. Even then Parliament did not emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833.

‚ÄúBut it didn‚Äôt go as planned,‚Äù Otele said. ‚ÄúPlantation owners, some of them absentee plantation owners because they lived in Britain, were extremely wealthy. Their ancestors had been trading for centuries so they resisted and put pressure on Parliament ... to pay them for the so-called loss of their property..‚Äù

The 1837 Compensation Act led to 20 million pounds, 40% of the national budget at the time, being paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves. It took until 2015 for the Bank of England to pay off the debt from those payouts.

What is the current debate about?
The movement demanding reparations goes back decades.

The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed deep sorrow in 2006 for Britain‚Äôs role in the trade but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for descendants of slaves. Activists said Blair‚Äôs careful word choice reflected the government‚Äôs fear of paying out huge reparations.

In 2013, the Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom made a list of requests including that European governments formally apologize and create a repatriation program for those who wish to return to their homeland, which has not happened.

On Thursday, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said he wanted a ‚Äúfrank‚Äù discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of reparations in the leaders‚Äô final statement at the Samoa event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General ‚Äî from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho ‚Äî have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery.

Other European nations, including the Netherlands, and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade.

The Church of England last year announced a 100-million-pound ($130 million) fund last year for projects ‚Äúfocused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery,‚Äù though a church advisory panel said it should increase it to $1 billion.

Some of the descendants of slave traders have made their own amends.

A descendant of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone ‚Äî father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone ‚Äî apologized last year to Guyana for his great-great-great grandfather‚Äôs role as an absentee slave owner in what was then British Guiana. He received 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves.

After earlier insisting that the Samoa summit should avoid becoming mired in the past and ‚Äúvery, very long endless discussions about reparations,‚Äù Starmer acknowledged ‚Äúcalls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice.‚Äù

Starmer said the ‚Äúmost effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.‚Äù

Jacqueline McKenzie ‚Äî a partner at London law firm Leigh Day ‚Äî working on the issue of reparations, said the issue of how to reckon with the legacy of the slave trade is ‚Äúcomplex.‚Äù

‚ÄúReparations is not straightforward,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAt the moment it‚Äôs a discussion among the elites, and the people, the descendants of the enslaved ‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt really part of the discussion.‚Äù

1. Do you usually count calories, or just eat until you are full?
2. What is the deal with oils and condiments? I have been air frying russet potatoes with coconut oil and dipping them in low-sugar ketchup‚Äîwill this affect the diet‚Äôs benefits?
3. Do you stick to 100% potatoes? I would like to include a protein shake, a protein bar, and some dairy (like cheese) for extra protein.
4. Assuming it is okay to drink black coffee and tea on this diet?
5. I tend to treat myself on weekends (Friday 3pm to Sunday 8pm). My plan is to intermittent fast and eat 80% potatoes from Monday noon to Friday 3pm. Would this impact the diet's effectiveness?

1gcn6to,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1gcn6to/ha_giang_loop_bibis_review/,Ha Giang Loop - Bibi's Review,"I'm just back from doing the Ha Giang Loop with Bibis and wanted to share my experience. Reddit has always helped me when travelling, so felt it was time to give back!

For context, I'm a 30-year-old British male solo traveller and a vegetarian. I did the 3D2N trip with Bibi in mid October 2024.

TLDR -
I had a great experience and would score it 4/5. I liked that we had a small group of 25-35-year-olds, we went off the beaten track, and enjoyed decent food and accomodation. But I would have enjoyed the opportunity to go for a hike.

Route & Activities -
I liked that Bibis offer the chance to get off the beaten track. At least one section everyday was off the main route, following single tracks through villages and mountain passes. We did the loop counter clockwise. Day 1 - lots of view points, swim in a waterfall, visit a village of an ethnic minority. Day 2 - more view points, bamboo raft and swim up a river into a cave, see the  Chinese border. Day 3 - more viewpoints and big trip back to Ha Giang. The river swim was my favourite activity, absolutely loved it. I felt uncomfortable during the visit to the village (too voyeuristic), but the others in the group enjoyed it. I would have liked to do a hike at some point which I know some other tours do. 

Guides -
Each group has at least one English speaking driver who could answer our questions about the local culture, economy, rice agriculture etc. All the drivers were really friendly and from the local area, though most didn't speak English. The drivers were a tight group of friends in their 20s. Most had Bluetooth speakers on their bikes that would play your music whilst driving if you wanted to.

Group -
I picked Bibis as it seemed to attract a slightly older crowd than the party tours. Our groups were 25-35 year olds from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain etc. When we started there there two groups - 5 doing the 3D and 7 doing the 4D. We saw the other group during the evenings, but kept in our groups in the day. Based on the other groups we saw on the road, I would say the average tour group on the loop is between 8-12, but some tours have massive groups of 25+ (particularly HangHao).

Accomodation, Food & Drink -
Both nights of accommodation were decent - clean but basic. Although they were advertised as dorms, they were actually a big room divided into mini rooms by curtains/plywood but without a ceiling. Which is better in my opinion. The food was good - we had a different breakfast every day (omelette, pancakes, pho), always a family sharing style lunch, and different meals in the evening (sharing platter and hotpot). I really enjoyed the hotpot and that they explained how to do it. As a veggie I had no problems and had plenty of options. Apart from breakfast, I could have always eaten vegan if I had wanted. In the evening we were given ""happy water"" (moonshine) and could purchase beer for a decent price. Both nights we had social activities - karaoke and a few bars - but it never went on later than 10ish so you didn't feel hungover or disturb people who wanted to sleep.

Bikes, Equipment & Safety -
All our drivers had Honda WinnerX bikes (not Blade or Waves which were common on the route). We were provided with a helmet and elbow/knee pads. I'd estimate that less than 20% of other groups had pads provided. All the drivers were very safe. We did an average of 30-40kmph, but were much slower on rough terrain, there were no scary overtakes, and we never went above 60kmph on the straight. The drivers were also strict on them not drinking much in the evenings and going to bed early so not to be hungover.

Costs and booking -
I paid $165 for the ""regular"" 3D2N tour with Bibis. I had the option to upgrade to private rooms for $20-40 more but didnt. I would budget for about $8-10 per day for snacks, coffee, beer whilst there. I booked through WhatsApp, contacting Bibi directly. His number is on the website. I paid a $100 deposit online and the rest in person. Bibi is very happy to answer any questions through WhatsApp before or after booking.

Self-Drive Vs Easyrider -
I think Bibi only takes easyriders as they go off the beaten track  on challenging single track routes. Twice we had to get off the bikes to let local farmers pass which was a laugh. I would estimate that over 80% of tourists on the route were on easyriders. I had wanted to self drive but was put off by the risk of multiple fines. However, speaking to others on the route and my driver, I found out that you will only be fined once, and are  given a receipt to show you've been fined if you are stopped again. Contrary to what I'd read elsewhere, I met a German couple who had an international license and had been stopped twice by the police but had not been fined. They were on a bike below 125cc. I saw 4 police checkpoints during my tour, a few westerners had been stopped at one of them.

3 day Vs 4 day -
The 3 day tour fitted my timeline best. By not doing 4 days, we missed visiting the flag tower overlooking China (but we still saw the Chinese border) and a cave. But to be honest, 3 days felt like the right amount. By the last day my bum hurt and I felt like I'd seen enough mountains.

Other Bits -
Bibi offers to book the coach for you. I chose not to, but would recommend you do as the other people on the tour who did paid the same as I did through 12Go and they were dropped off/picked up from Bibis whilst I had to get a taxi.
You can stay the night before your trip at Bibis for free, but note that the beds aren't changed every day (I just used the clean towel they provided to cover the pillow).
For a Brit, it was not cold despite what the drivers warned us. I wore shorts and tee the whole time, apart from one evening when I put on a fleece.
It was really hard to find a recommended amount for tipping the driver. I went for 700K as I really liked my driver, but would have given around 500K if not.
If you're restless like me, you should know that there is a lot of sitting and enjoying the views on the loop (with any tour), so embrace it.

I hope that's helpful! I'm happy to answer questions. I know I don't have a lot of post karma, but Bibi explicitly asked for us to review him on Reddit rather than other sites. Plus I felt it was time to give back.

‚ÄúThis is AWACS Eagle-Eye, I‚Äôve got eyes on numerous hostiles but most are currently in civilian-heavy areas‚Äù Eagle-Eye called out. ‚ÄúEngage the units I‚Äôve tagged, and watch for buildings‚Äù‚ÄúCopy that‚Äù I replied, wrapping a talon around the control stick.

‚ÄúOh, and Quartz One‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to have you back‚Äù

‚ÄúGood to hear from you too, buddy‚Äù We all spread out and began to accelerate towards the enemy, as I locked onto an anti-air gun and fired, detonating it before it even turned to face me.¬†

‚ÄúOh hell yeah, back from the dead and Quartz gets first blood!‚Äù Kraisal cheered, causing me to chuckle.‚ÄúHell of a thing to celebrate, Mimic‚Äù I raised my nose, swerving past a lit building and out of sight of another, unmarked anti-air gun, just as it fired a few rounds at my tail.

‚ÄúFounders damn it, more predator aircraft!‚Äù An enemy called out. ‚ÄúWe need to move before they-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre staying here!‚Äù Another replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all that stands between them and our retreating units! Besides, they won‚Äôt risk losing cattle, so use the civilians as cover if you need to!‚Äù

I lowered my nose once more, lining up a passing enemy tank and firing an anti-ground missile straight into the vehicle, leaving it a smouldering wreck. I surveyed my radar again, spotting a few targets closer to the city's heart.

The sound of news chatter filtered through my radio as I ascended for my next attack run. ‚Äú...Seventh night of combat throughout the city. Local Exterminators and Resistance forces remain spread out and‚Ä¶ *Regretfully* on the retreat. The Coalition and anti-Resistence forces are merely a few blocks away from this building in fact, pushing ahead almost unimpeded, based on what our newscasters have see-...-We‚Äôre back, that was anti-Resistance propaganda listeners, the tides have turned and we are winning handily‚Äù

I heard Vilik snicker over the radio as the newscaster was ‚Äòcorrected‚Äô, while Frank simply groaned.

My plane's warning systems suddenly began to beep, as a rocket flew off a nearby building and straight towards me. I pointed my nose straight to the sky, before pulling back hard, narrowly evading the missile before I corrected myself and continued on my attack run.

I locked onto the lead truck in an enemy convoy, firing a missile at it before switching to the vehicle just behind and firing another. I turned and unloaded my guns into the backmost vehicle as the front two detonated, shredding it and trapping the last remaining truck between the wreckage. I then unleashed a wave of bullets into the final truck, leaving it a destroyed wreck, alongside the rest of the convoy, before I pulled up once more, passing over the lit skyline and into a darkened part of the city.

I then heard a familiar voice from over the radio. ‚ÄúCan anyone read me? This is Bravo Two, of the UN one-hundred-and-second Collar Cutters airborne division. We‚Äôve been holding the main bridge to one of the cities artificial islands since we dropped, but there‚Äôs a full fucking armoured division about to roll over it and we don‚Äôt have anything left to wreck em with! Sifil rigged the bridge to blow but the detonator‚Äôs dead, we need air support!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shit, Bravo Two! Hey!‚Äù Kai replied. ‚ÄúBeen a hot minute! Lars, you‚Äôre the closest I think, lend them a hand!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, wilco!‚Äù I responded, as a point on the bridge popped onto my radar, alongside the large group of tanks passing over it.

‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äù Bravo Two chuckled. ‚ÄúWhip them good, SCOSG!‚Äù

I turned and began to approach the bridge, before multiple missiles and a wave of anti-air fire suddenly flew out from the island and towards me. I squawked in surprise before turning hard, deploying flares mere moments before the missiles reached me. I steadied out my aircraft a mere dozen metres high, as bullets continued to fly overhead, keeping me flying just above the water.¬†

Even then, I was still able to lock onto the bridge, though I was unable to fly above it, and I felt my feathers fluff up slightly as I realised what I had to do. I fired two missiles into the bridge, flying below it just as it detonated, shaking my craft from the shockwave but otherwise mercifully leaving me unharmed. I then pulled up hard, retreating to the safety of high altitude as the anti-air fire petered out.¬†

I breathed a sigh of relief, before calling out. ‚ÄúI got it, Bravo Two. You should be clear now‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we saw the blast from here!‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúWe really appreciate the save‚Äù

‚ÄúAny time. Just uh, don‚Äôt expect me to fly under another bridge‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh, you got it ma‚Äôam. Alright, boys, let‚Äôs take five, then find more shit to stir! Dove One, got any more shit you need taken or demoed?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll aircraft, be advised‚Äù Eagle-Eye suddenly spoke. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got several aircraft coming in from multiple bearings, looks like enemy UAV‚Äôs. They‚Äôre actively transmitting, something‚Äôs off‚Äù

‚ÄúDrones? That‚Äôs not so bad‚Äù Vilik responded. ‚ÄúEvasive sure, but-‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, hold on! Projectile inbound! Ten seconds, everyone away from the drones!‚Äù

And then, a voice came in over the radio that I hadn‚Äôt heard since the sinking of the Pulsar almost a year ago. ‚ÄúLoad another shell, crush those interlopers under the fury of our gun!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, captain!‚Äù Another responded, zeal in their voice.

I immediately dived down, flying between unlit streets as one of the drones passed by overhead. I slowed down, swooping past buildings as it flew far above me.¬†

‚ÄúImpact!‚Äù The world was suddenly lit up in a bright orange flash, the sky above me being consumed in a vast explosion.

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù Kai yelled, as the light died out. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that!?‚Äù

I pulled up above the buildings once more, watching in horror as another drone flew towards her. ‚ÄúKraisal, drone!‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, it‚Äôs-‚Äù She tried to respond, before being cut off by another explosion.¬†

‚ÄúKRAISAL!‚Äù I screamed. I felt my breath hitch, waiting for her to say anything.

The seconds dragged on, as the smoke from the blast faded out. I saw her plane flying straight, but still she remained silent.

And then she pulled up. ‚ÄúHoly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm good, I‚Ä¶ Jesus, I almost passed out‚Äù

I breathed a sigh of relief. ‚ÄúMaltos, you scared the shit outta me! Are you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, but my plane‚Äôs wrecked. I‚Äôm gonna have to pull out. Stir up hell for me, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWill do Kai‚Äù Vilik butted in. ‚ÄúKeep your dumb ass alive, you still owe me that everclear‚Äù

Kraisal turned and sped out the airspace, while the battle below continued to rage. Another couple of drones flew into the airspace, which Eagle-Eye quickly marked. ‚ÄúThose drones are active terminal guidance systems, the shells they‚Äôre guiding are launched from across the horizon. Stay on your toes, don‚Äôt let them sneak up on you‚Äù

‚ÄúWilco‚Äù I turned to target more enemies, spotting a few previously unmarked enemy vehicles speeding through the streets. I turned towards one, diving down and firing a missile straight into it, immediately wrecking it.

‚ÄúSir, the enemy air support are coming straight at us!‚Äù One enemy called out.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter, keep moving! If anyone tries to stop us, kill them!‚Äù Another responded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre dressed like a Founders-damned Prestige, assume they‚Äôre a partisan and run them over if you need to! This entire accursed city is diseased anyways‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo more shells ready to fire, captain!‚Äù A third announced.¬†

‚ÄúExcellent!‚Äù The captain replied. ‚ÄúFire them both! Wipe them away with our lead, and purge them from our world!‚Äù

I pulled up, only to see an enemy aircraft passing by overhead. I slowed and fired a missile towards them, which they swiftly evaded, deploying flares and pulling hard to the left, making a surprisingly sharp turn. We each faced each other, and my warning systems blared to life as they fired a missile. I fired my own, deployed flares, and pulled back hard, being thrown into my seat, my inertial dampeners almost failing. But the missile passed me by, while my own bomb impacted their craft directly, tearing them to pieces.¬†

I took a moment to breathe, surveying the battlefield for a moment. I noticed Pegasus sneaking behind a drone over another part of the city, firing off a group of multilocks. The UAV evaded all but one, which slammed into its tail, blasting it to pieces. ‚ÄúDrone down‚Äù Eagle-Eye announced. ‚ÄúLooks like the shell it was guiding exploded mid-travel!‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôve got a solution!‚Äù Frank announced.¬†

‚ÄúOh hell yeah!‚Äù A friendly pilot called out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna-‚Äù They were cut off by a massive explosion, as the other shell hit its mark.¬†

‚ÄúRedrock Nine lost!‚Äù Frank spoke once more, as the distant clouds cleared out.¬†

‚ÄúAll aircraft, take out any drones you can, but be extremely careful, they remain actively dangerous!‚Äù

I sighed, before turning and flying towards two enemy vehicles speeding down the highway. I switched to anti-ground missiles, firing one at the lead vehicle. It sent a wave of ammunition at me in response, but I swerved out the way as my weapon hit its mark, silencing them immediately. The other swerved out the way of the wreckage, while I sent a wave of machine gun fire towards it. The driver seemed to panic, swerving wildly, before crashing into the side of the highway, smashing into a wall and grinding to a halt. *Inatala‚Ä¶ I just feel bad for that one.*

I looked over my radar, feeling myself relax as it showed up clear of enemies within city limits. Pegasus destroyed two more drones, and I noticed no more flying in to take their place.

‚ÄúCaptain, command has pulled back our guidance drones‚Äù The zealot spoke through the newfound quiet

‚ÄúDamnable-Pull us back to the rest of the fleet, rearm, and submerge. We‚Äôll get the false prey next time‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes captain!‚Äù

Then, the news chatter from before filtered in, while the last few unlit buildings in the city flickered to life. ‚Äú...That was a Coalition armoured convoy that passed by the studio. The Exterminator monitoring the program has fled, and we can now proudly announce that the SC seems to be victorious! This is a great day for Ironforge, listeners. I know I‚Äôll be drinking to celebrate!‚Äù The newscaster chucked.

Shortly after, Eagle-Eye announced over the radio. ‚ÄúAll rebel forces have retreated or been neutralised, the city is officially under Coalition control once more‚Äù

‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù Vilik replied. ‚ÄúI hope I never have to fly urban ever again! Shit was a pain‚Äù

‚ÄúFact it was night didn‚Äôt help‚Äù Frank added. ‚ÄúSure my son‚Äôll wanna hear about it, though‚Äù

‚ÄúAll aircraft, RTB‚Äù Eagle-Eye cut in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost one in the morning and I have not had enough coffee to deal with casual chatter‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúWilco‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôll get your beauty sleep, Protector knows you need it‚Äù Vilik butted in.¬†

*For a first mission back, I think that could‚Äôve gone worse.*

Hello all, 

Another week, another shot! 

I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I‚Äôm an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I‚Äôm rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who‚Äôs serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I‚Äôm also an ass man so bonus points if you‚Äôre a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that‚Äôs me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don‚Äôt smoke, drink or do drugs but I‚Äôm not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain‚Äôt going to work. 
A bit more about me below ‚¨áÔ∏è 

* 41, Caucasian, 6‚Äô1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you‚Äôll meet. Period. 
* I‚Äôm a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I‚Äôm a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I‚Äôm ready for. I‚Äôm getting tired of people telling ME that I‚Äôm not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself. Same goes for you. I don‚Äôt want a penpal and I don‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time. ",1,1729955186.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

I recently landed myself in the ER because for three or four days I was feeling heart palpitations and was very light headed. I had no prior feeling of anxiety to this. But the docs in the ER humored me and ran tests to rule out anything serious like heart attack, clots, dissection, leaky valves, build up etc. They said everything came back normal and that I had no signs of any palpitations happening during my EKG either. They said it could be too much caffeine or nicotine (I am a smoker, about half a pack a day, coffee about 3 cups a day) and to just ease up on my intakes. But no signs of danger whatsoever and that my heart and lungs are perfectly healthy. 
It‚Äôs been three days now since that visit and I‚Äôm still feeling these palpitations and have still been light headed every now and then. Not as frequently, but I still feel like something is off. 
 
If anyone here has ever had the same symptoms, how long have they lasted? What did you do to help ease them until they disappeared?

I am currently looking to build my first real espresso set up. I am pretty confident on getting the DF54 for the grinder but I am still hesitating for the espresso machine itself. 

I read some very good reviews about the bambino on here but I also discovered the aroma by belluci while browsing on some specialised canadian coffee machine webstores. There is not much information about this machine on the internet which is one of the reasons why I am not sure if I should get it. As for the bambino, the internet is flooding with infos which I think is a big pro. The aroma is slightly cheeper, seems to have a better steamer wand and has a pressure gauge which the breville has not. 

I think it is really great to have a community to look up to if my machine has any problem but the aroma seems very great too. I am having a very difficult time making a decision. Any advice is appreciated.

For years now, I have been working two jobs to buy a home.  I've been spending a lot of time advancing my career to put myself in a comfortable position to become a mother.  I always made time for him though, planning little trips.  Writing cute notes, cooking him meals.  I feel like I was a great partner up until the very end.  The relationship was very loving and likely the first healthy relationship I've ever been in.  He was incredibly loyal to me, he thought the world of me.  I wish he loved himself the way he loved me.  There was no betrayal, no love lost.

Initially, marriage/motherhood were not things I wanted in life.  When I entered the relationship, this was my stance.  He was working at a coffee shop and living a very peaceful life with zero plans for the future.  I communicated my change of heart in Year 2 of our relationship, thinking that he would be happy as I know he wanted these things too.  I was ready for that next step, after spending 5 years single, becoming the best version of myself.

I really matured over the 4 years we were together.  And, he didnt.  After a while, I grew resentful of his stagnant life even though these were the terms I entered the relationship with.  WHY OH WHY did I think anything was going to change?!?!? I became the naggy girlfriend like ""when are you gunna do this?"" and I started not believing what he was telling me anymore (ex: I promise I will change, I promise I will get a better job).  I started hating who I was becoming in the relationship too, I started putting him down.  I was losing respect for him.  How can you watch me work my ass off while you do nothing to carry this load with me?  I know he loved me, but a part of me thinks he loved what I could provide for him.

We were both on two totally different paths and I think we, both, needed to find someone better suited for those paths.  I wish I could just accept him for who he was, but there was too much I wanted to change.  I never thought I'd be the chick with arbitrary timelines but I became one of those lol... I was so tired of waiting.  And, I know it wasnt fair to put that pressure on him when he wasnt ready for it.",5,1729954757.0,BreakUps,3,0.86,False

1gcmwjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBreastGrowth/comments/1gcmwjk/pcos_findings/,PCOS findings ,"Hi NBG, 

Here's a simpler way to look (and approach) at PCOS. Androgens circulating in the bloodstream via SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) can be converted by an enzyme called 5 alpha reductase to a ""free androgens""... which can interact with androgen receptors and make changes inside mitochondria, meaning making deleterious changes in DNA like PCOS. 

In other words, as quoted in science: 
""Low SHBG levels‚Äù result in the circulating free androgen concentration... which can turn into DHT and subsequently create PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).

So the goal for all PCOS sufferers is to ""RAISE SHBG Levels""....not lower it. And when you raise SHBG you slowly turn off PCOS. That's my viewpoint. Start finding ingredients and things that increase SHBG. 

What raises SHBG?..One study below indicates vitamin D3 between 1,000iu to 4,000iu per day raises SHBG and has a beneficial effect on lowering androgens.
Metformin raises SHBG, but it's really hard on digestion.

Drinking coffee can raise SHBG 

Effects of vitamin D supplementation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a review

Daniela Menichini et al. Gynecol Endocrinol. 2020 Jan.
Abstract

Increasing evidence supports the contribution of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in metabolic disturbances among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This review aims to assess the associations between vitamin D levels and metabolic/endocrine dysregulations and to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and hormone functionality in PCOS patients. We searched in PubMed human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English between 2016 and 2019 on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on PCOS. Nine studies were included and analyzed. Vitamin D supplementation restored physiological serum 25(OH)D levels in PCOS women in all the studies included. In six studies, it significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose and brought improvements in insulin resistance (IR) and serum fasting insulin. In addition, four studies reported decreases of serum triglycerides, while discordant data are reported as far as LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels. High-doses of vitamin D (4000 IU), compared with low-dose (1000 IU), and placebo, showed beneficial effects on total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI). Vitamin D supplementation at high doses for a period of at least 12 weeks, may lead to improvement in terms of glucose level, insulin sensitivity, hyperlipidemia, and hormonal functionality in PCOS women.

A bit of back story, my wife asked for a separation back in April, and she subsequently filed for divorce in August. Leading up to the separation, I have been on the side of fighting for our marriage. Ironically, a year ago last August, my wife had an affair with an ex that she swore would not happen again so long as she was married. I could never get her to commit to working on the marriage, but kept saying she needed to work on her to determine if she could work on the marriage. In a lot of ways made me angry, but I believe in the permanence of marriage, and the importance of ensuring to see the good of longevity. 

As we were still in counseling but getting nowhere, I met this young lady who had similar interests as I do (outdoors type stuff like hiking, and surfing), and I remember her asking me after mentioning my wife (after an hour long conversation with a stranger in a hardware store) if it were possible to marry someone you could have fun with. When she asked me that question I remember it haunting me, because I remember thinking initially my wife and I had fun, but I couldn‚Äôt ever seem to get her to do anything or go anywhere anymore. The most I could get her to do was watch tv at home ‚Äîand that‚Äôs not my speed. Well since she filed for divorce I‚Äôve been thinking about that conversation more and more‚Äîthat and the fact that girl was attractive and smelled good (but that‚Äôs neither here nor there). Well I never got that lady‚Äôs info, because I didn‚Äôt even want to entertain the idea of an affair or lines getting blurred. 

Well on Monday I had a similar experience. All of my belongings are out of the house my wife and I shared except my grand piano ‚Äîthat needs 30k worth of work. Having it moved to spend more on it than a new one would cost doesn‚Äôt make sense. So I went piano shopping. As I‚Äôm test driving pianos a lady comes in who has some of the same musical influences I have. Not only that we instantly connected, and had a 30 minute conversation about  music with some slight flirtation. She even asked to connect on Facebook‚Äî where I had not changed anything that suggested my wife filed for divorce‚Äîprimarily because I‚Äôm a Christian minister who doesn‚Äôt really believe in divorce to begin with, but here I am. 

Here‚Äôs my question: Do you think I should ask her to coffee or to come check out the new piano I‚Äôm having delivered? Or do I need to publicly make it known we‚Äôre getting a divorce? Or do I need to wait until there‚Äôs a divorce decree in my hand ",3,1729954450.0,relationship_advice,13,0.71,False

Since January of this year have working out hard via ketogains program. 

Besides losing weight and gaining muscle, my inflammation is low (both anecdotally and by labs). A1C is 4.7 and fasting glucose is always below 100. HOMA-IR is also very low in the safe range.

Last night, someone was calling me, no profile picture plus I know the name is fictional because it is based on a TV show I know. I was already sleeping but he called me twice, of course I didn‚Äôt answer since I don‚Äôt know him. I was able to hear the second call and feeling groggy, I opened my IG message and saw him send a video that can only be viewed once, which I stupidly opened. I don‚Äôt know but I was too sleepy because I am 100 percent sure it was his genitals. It was all blurry now but I know that after 2 seconds I exited the video when I slightly realized what it was. Disgusting! I did receive these kinds of messages but dang, they call too and disturb one‚Äôs sleep? I thought the anonymity helps creepy people get away with their disgusting horrific behavior. I immediately blocked his account, cleansed my following list and went back to sleep. Luckily, I was so sleepy I am starting to doubt if I saw the right thing but since he was a  stranger, blocked. 

Ugh, additionally before I blocked him I saw that he was also following a mutual account that I follow however, I think it is also because the owner isn‚Äôt private as well, which made me wonder that maybe I accepted the follow request because of that but didn‚Äôt follow him of course, stupid me.

For some context, I work as a materials tester for a company that does testing for various big and small construction projects and one of those projects I was on happened to be Wind Farms (the big windmills that collect Wind energy), like alot of my jobs these start very early in the AM and I had been on this project for a few weeks now testing whats going in the ground, and I was to be frank, wiped out. I am also an extremely heavy sleeper, and a regular pot smoker so you can imagine I sleep hard and I don't dream, I actually need around half a dozen or more Alarms ln the morning to wake up on time. 

Well the morning I'm talking about, I was having this crazy vivid dream about living on a homestead, or atleast i think it was a homestead, hard to tell really time period or place because I was surrounded by three to five wolves and we were all really bloodied up, like it was a hell of a fight. Well what woke me up was this move where I dodged a wolf, cut it with an axe or knife before turning quickly with a hard kick to another wolf that was jumping at me, and it was when I kicked that wolf that my foot hit something on my coffee table, and it was that physical contact plus the sound of it falling woke me up literally minutes before I before I had to leave for work, now if you asked what happened to the Alarms? I didn't set them....straight fucking up, I did not set a single fucking alarm that morning.

So since then I keep going back to that dream and I believe Fenrir was looking out for me and making sure I did not sleep through my day by sending me that very real feeling dream, and to clarify I know what my dreams are usually like when I go through one of my cleanses and my dreams have never been that vivid, graphic or violent before....maybe I'm wrong and it's just that a dream, but I felt something when I woke up that just tells me it wasn't just a dream ya know?",1,1729953218.0,NorsePaganism,0,0.67,False
1gcmdmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1gcmdmi/brownnoser_at_work_updated/,Brown-Noser At Work (updated),"

I work in a biotech startup and we recently got a new lab technician on the team, who just got their BS last year.  The new tech was easy to get along with in the beginning and I enjoyed getting to know them, despite being an introvert and having a depressing summer (dealing with 2 recent deaths from cancer).  Once the tech got into the role, I was noticing early signs: parroting what the lab manager says and their mannerisms and sucking up to both the CSO and our boss.  The new tech also pestered me when I needed to do the weekly bio safety hood cleanups (everyone has to do this and the lab manager made a schedule for us to rotate each week to keep it fair).  I was halfway done and the tech kept asking me if I needed help.  The first time was fine but after multiple times, I said, ‚ÄúI appreciate you offering but this is my responsibility.  Everyone has to do this and I‚Äôm literally almost done.  Plus we had a busy day.‚Äù  The tech responded, ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll just sit at my desk and do nothing!‚Äù  I was like, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  Like were they trying to make me feel guilty for saying no?  The lab tech also had petty arguments with the lab manager to the point where I found them to be both annoying.  After going over the results of some experiment with the CSO, the new tech threw out, ‚ÄúBy the way, I made all these reagents for you!‚Äù (In the tone of, ‚ÄúI made it for you, you lazy bum‚Ä¶‚Äù) and the CSO was like, ‚ÄúOh, um thank you.‚Äùüò≥For the boss, the boss needed to do a group discussion with me, the new tech, and my team.  We get certain organs from deceased donors to harvest cells for research purposes and the boss was stressing about the idea of us having to harvest this weekend.  The lab manager was going to be out for an obligation, hence unavailable for the weekend.  The new tech said, ‚ÄúMy roommate wanted to go to this college football game and I was waiting until last minute to buy tickets in case we got an organ so if we got an organ, I was going to help with that instead of going to the game.‚Äù  I was sitting at the opposite side of the room at my desk (they couldn‚Äôt see me behind my monitor), but I rolled my eyes‚Ä¶ my boss is very understanding if we had plans.  The boss told me numerous times that I‚Äôm free to have plans and to take vacation days (I‚Äôve been known to never take days off unless I needed to).  I know the new tech had good intentions (as far as I‚Äôm aware), but they seemed to look like they‚Äôre trying really hard to say the right things‚Ä¶ to suck up.  Case in point, the tech then said, ‚ÄúI really hope we get an organ this week and next week.‚Äù  The thing is, we rely solely on when the donor dies as well as if there are any damages that might jeopardise with harvesting‚Ä¶ every case is a surprise for us.  As we were closing off the meeting, the new tech said to the boss, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be available so you can just call me.‚Äù  The boss said, ‚ÄúI actually prefer to keep it as a group message to confirm everyone‚Äôs availability and if anything happens, we would at least know and work on how we could cover each other‚Ä¶‚Äù as if the boss seemed to pick up that the new tech was sucking up.  I know it‚Äôs best to ignore them and to focus on myself, but the tech is on my team (I have 5 years of professional lab experience plus 1 year in undergrad while the new tech has 1 year and like I said, just graduated last year‚Ä¶ the boss told me that the tech isn‚Äôt going to replace me at all and the boss does their best to cherish every member of the lab) and we share spaces‚Ä¶ we both mainly share a room as our office space.  When it gets too annoying for me (I have low tolerance for that and for bs), I stick my ear buds in to drown out the noise and to focus on my work.

Edit 1: Nothing like waking up at 4am on Saturday to a group text from that new tech, saying, ‚ÄúGood morning!  See you guys soon.‚Äù  There was an organ case that day and I was unable to go due to travelling for a friend‚Äôs wedding that I attended that afternoon.  I just find that to be rude and obnoxious of them.

Edit 2: Now that new tech complains about everything‚Ä¶ being tired all the time (they‚Äôre overweight for their height after dealing with COVID-19), being sore (whether or not they went to the gym the night before), and various things with the lab manager (doing tasks for the lab manager or doing SOPs‚Ä¶ what this new tech was literally hired to do).  I know to stay quiet during this or tune it out with my music and I tried to resolve this by saying things like, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stretch your legs out for a bit after all this sitting?  Maybe it‚Äôll help‚Ä¶ How about some coffee to do the trick?  We have plenty of K cups‚Ä¶‚Äù, but there were times when I was ready to say, ‚ÄúShut up!  Quit whining!  This is what you were hired to do‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt like it, either you talk to your boss or leave!‚Äù  I know to keep quiet about this, but this is among the many times I find them to be annoying.  I know I can‚Äôt do anything to control it but like I said, we share the same spaces everyday and it‚Äôs becoming a distraction to me.  

The funny thing is, my boss noticed how much I‚Äôve kept my distance (even though I still like my boss and I‚Äôm just trying to focus on getting my work done‚Ä¶ focus more on myself and our cases‚Ä¶ I think those few things are more important than drama).

Edit 3: We have a pending case this weekend and if there weren‚Äôt any delays, we would have to be in the lab by 8pm to process the organ.  If there were delays, we would process it Sunday morning.  I told my boss that I don‚Äôt have any issues doing it Sunday morning, but the brown-noser said, ‚ÄúActually, I prefer Saturday night.‚Äù  Here they are saying this while complaining about being tired all day.üôÑAll I can say about this is, ‚ÄúYour choice.  You do you.‚Äù

I noticed that when I drown all this out with music, I catch the tech complaining and if they leave the room, they look at me like they were hoping to get my attention.  Not even close‚Ä¶ I have more important things to focus on.",1,1729953150.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

I wanna know if i am tripping or not, i am a male i have a friend who is also a male and we have been closed friends for 2 years like we are so closed so that we sleep in the same bed when i am at his house, we basically understand each other so much, anyway after 2 days i was with him and we were talking until we fall asleep sleep on each other. Next day we were planning to go to another city so he can show me his new car, that night another friend of him was with us so the other friend slept on the couch and we both slept on my friend‚Äòs bed. 
So the morning came and i said I cant go because i didn‚Äôt slept well so you guys can go without me, the went and i was a lone at my friend‚Äòs house, i woke up am hour later i made me coffee and showered and I made the bed and then went to my house he texted me if i am a wake i said yes and i am heading home. So the day went okay, the next morning he texted me if i took his 500‚Ç¨ he was putting in his bedroom closet, i was so confused but i said no i didn‚Äôt why? He said because i put it there and i didn‚Äôt found it, i said okay and you are suspect me that i took it? 
Then he said did u closed the door well after you left? I said when u were back home did u found it open? 
He said i didn‚Äôt came home after i arrived i went to work my friend came home. 
I said okay did u asked him if he found the door open when he was there? He said no he found closed.
Then i was like okay then why are you suspected my? 
He said well i thought that u took it as a joke and you will give to me when i will realise that its not there. 
I said no i didn‚Äôt took any 500‚Ç¨  from you matter of fact i dont even touch his stuff even when he is a round. Anyway i was so upset that he suspected me but yeah. So i asked him what about your other friend he was also at your house alone. 
He said well i asked him he said he didn‚Äôt took it either. So last night we were talking and he said that his friend said i took the money and i went with it, and he said to me i told him no i know him very well he don‚Äôt do that, but the his friend gaslighted him that what he is thinking is wrong. Anyway i was like what about doing fingerprints so you can prove who really did it because i was very very upset and he said yeah he will do that but he is waiting for the person who is doing that because the person is on holiday. So his last words were swear to me that you didn‚Äôt took it, i was like bro i swear to got i didn‚Äôt took any 500‚Ç¨ from you and now i want you to do that fingerprints thing so this is what will determine who took the money. 
The thing is i have two theories the first one either his friend did this so me and my closer friend won‚Äôt be friends anymore because he is jealous or he hate me, or my closer friend made all this up so that we can never be friends again. Because i am really counting. Can anyone tell me i am tripping or what is this? I need opinions please. ",0,1729953053.0,AmItheAsshole,4,0.33,False

He has 20 days to have things sorted out. Again, I wished him the best of luck for the issues. 

Fast forward a couple days, he asked for my WhatsApp and we connected in the app. He was back to my city. I was like -- fine he is back doing his things. And last night I had a dinner plan with my girls. We planned to have a dinner at place with a ton of eateries and this place is directly connected to an apartment. I asked him which area of the city he's staying in but it is this exact apartment building I was having my dinner at! What a coincidence. We tried to catch up on each other, finding each others' exact locations in the area and what's funny was, he was standing right next to my girl who was also waiting for me for the dinner. A rather awkward situation tho! So I said hi to him, fist bumped him and I legit told him I would get back to him after my dinner and I did! 

We got cheap ass coffee at a 24 hours convenient store, sat on a bench right in front of the store and we talked for hours! All the sitting had caused his back to hurt because he is super tall! So we decided to take walks at 1 in the morning with my second cup of coffee in hand and his second ice chocolate in his. (He does not drink coffee.) We had such mentally and emotionally stimulating talks and I loved every bit of him.

It's been 3-4 years since i fall in the coffee rabbit hole, and i learn A LOT of things. One of these things is that my espresso machine (a Delonghi icona vintage buy for 20‚Ç¨) is a piece of crap. But i want to mod it a lot. I have already put an unpressurized IMS basket, and i will soon buy an adjustable OPV, a pressure gauge and a PID. I want to get rid of the steam wand, and finally rebuild it with wood from a pallet. So my question is: will it be always crap? What makes it bad?",0,1729952362.0,espresso,8,0.33,False

I‚Äôll be staying at my condo in qc for a month to focus on work (oct 27-nov 28) and I figured I might need some company while I‚Äôm there. 

About me:
I‚Äôm an introverted 5‚Äô9‚Äù chinito with glasses and a lot of tattoos. I regularly work out (run and gym), high sex drive :-), pleasing to the eyes I would say a 8-9/10. Am into cars, western series (binge-i ng breaking bad again), music taste is diverse but am listening to j-indie recently. I love dogs and coffee too!! I‚Äôm in the fulfillment industry :-)

About you:
I like tall women; but please don‚Äôt be taller than me! I hope you also work out so we could be running buddies too. Being hygienic is a no brainer. Mostly into titas but I can manage :-) 
Must be willing to swap pics!

Other preferences: chinita, nice thighs, wears glasses.

1gclzli,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gclzli/first_time_going_out_with_a_girl/,First time ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù with a girl ,"I‚Äôve been texting with a girl I met on Tinder for a while. At first, it was just casual conversation, but over time, things developed into something more. Recently, we had an open conversation about where we stand, and it turns out we‚Äôre both on the same page: we‚Äôre interested in seeing where this might lead and possibly building a relationship. I asked her to go out with me, and she agreed without hesitation.

We live in different cities, but it‚Äôs only about a 50-minute drive, so I‚Äôll be heading over to see her. Since she lives in a smaller town, we‚Äôre not planning anything big‚Äîjust some good conversation, grabbing coffee, and taking a walk.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm feeling uncertain: I haven‚Äôt been in this kind of situation before, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to act. How should I greet her? Would a handshake be better, or should I go for a hug? (I‚Äôm a bit worried a hug might feel too forward, since it‚Äôs our first time meeting in person.) Should I say something specific when I first see her? And what about flowers? I feel like it would be a nice gesture, but I don‚Äôt want to come across as too intense, especially since I‚Äôm still not sure if this is a casual meetup or more of a date.",2,1729952019.0,socialskills,3,1.0,False

I fly in at 5am on the 18th and then have Wednesday to myself, I will be in Nashville proper with evenings to myself, (il have the option for a rental if I want it, although with all due respect Nashville drivers are built different). I have some friends in East Nashville (their house is a block away from the redheaded stranger)  and Iv explored that area. but won‚Äôt have time to see them. But will have SOME downtime for myself. Iv been to Nashville a few times both solo before but feel it‚Äôs so sprawling that sometimes as much as I like it there I miss the pulse, Iv loved visiting friends in the area as they are in music and service industry and Iv gotten to see some cool gems. last time I was there was 2022. Is there anywhere you would suggest to a solo female traveler that you don‚Äôt see people recommend? I‚Äôd like to avoid the main strip, I would love to find a coffee shop that maybe is worth the drive that someone loved, I love buying funky art on my trips (mentioned that in my dc post lol) , a tattoo shop would be fun (maybe a place that I can take time to make an apt now with) my friends work in the service industry so I don‚Äôt want to bother them with such a short trip. I love dive bars but unfortunately I try to avoid drinking on business trips (had an uncomfortable experience a few years ago with a workmate I thought was safe and wasn‚Äôt) but I am checking bags so if there is a beer or locally made spirit that you like I can take it home. 

Also if there‚Äôs a funky thrift store,  (there are so so many I know, but maybe you can atleast tell me ones to not even bother with) I‚Äôm checking 3 bags. (Trade show and one personal) I collect antique charms, (I realize that‚Äôs a higher end thrift / hard thrift but I love the hunt lol) funky art, leaning towards abstract. 

I work in sustainability/ environmental technology if there‚Äôs a badass lady who wants to connect over coffee. Double points if she‚Äôs a mom because I seem to work in a profession with childless men who don‚Äôt get it. ",4,1729951953.0,femaletravels,1,0.75,False

1gclyfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1gclyfd/planning_a_spur_of_the_moment_bachelorette/,Planning a spur of the moment bachelorette. ,"My friend is ""T"" 

I'm not the bride and not in the bridal party (there is not one)

Background: I had my wedding last year and my bachelorette did not have any issues with planning . The only incident we had was two of my bridesmaids disappearing for 45 minutes on our camping trip and not taking part in the games. I was angry with them the day of my wedding and still hurt how they acted towards me. They did not get ready with me or my two other bridesmaids and shown up minutes before we had our pictures together. My engagement was an 8 month one and I was very stressed about it. 

Anyways. An old friend of mine we see each other probably once or twice a month. She has children and a busy work schedule. Shared the news with me and another friend she is having a very quick engagement like three weeks. I was so excited for my friend. She is not having a wedding party or MOH. ""T"" and myself wanted to help her with wedding planning stuff (get decorations ready ect) but the bride said that sister had planning done. No worries we offered to help set up the day before. They're not having a reception until next year so Bride told us her sister was looking at restaurants after the ceremony. 

Bride did vent to us about her mom wanting to overstep and invite so many people and take over planning. 

No one ever mentions a bachelorette party and the clock is ticking. It was crickets. Bride said she has been stressed for planning this wedding in such a short window. 

So we meet up to talk things over last weekend.
 ""T"" was like ""we need to take you to do something fun and dinner"" Bride thought that was really cool and nice. She said she wanted something really small because she has to get the wedding stuff ready the next day (decorating ect) 

Bride never gave T or myself a list of people she wanted there and was very hands off and said ""Oh surprise me!"" The only thing bride said was what kind of food she didn't want. 

So we planned to take the bride to an art studio for a class it's a two hour class and we would have been done by 6 PM and had the rest of the evening for dinner and games maybe a few pubs? The down payment for the studio was expensive so ""T"" and I split the cost and planned the same with dinner. Brides mom wanted to meet us for dinner afterwards and brides older sister said she would try if she wasn't swamped at work.

Everything seemed fine until we were put into a group chat a few days ago. It started off fine with talking to everyone about times that worked for dinner. Then both sisters found out about the studio and was angry. She called the bride complaining to her and then the older sister called bride yelling to her. Then yelling at our friend then at me. 
The wedding planning sister said ""T"" and I intentionally left them all out for the studio. Which T said that was not the case at all. 

Brides mom started adding more people to the chat (15 people and I or T didnt know any of these people) 

Brides mom told ""T"" and I to cancel the studio and that they will be taking over the party from here. 

Throughout the evening I was getting texts from brides mom and older sister ""We hope we didn't hurt your feelings those texts were not meant for you"" 

They had my name tagged in them. 
 
Brides mom stated that Bride thought more people would be  involved. 

Bride sends us a very long message and stated that her mom and siblings are just so excited to plan for the wedding and this party. That she has so many people yelling at her and are so angry. T and I did not yell at the bride. Bride stated we could do something different on her wedding weekend. Even though her party is on her wedding weekend. 

Then another friend (I don't know her) we will call her ""A"" called ""T"" and I negligent for not having Brides mother over for coffee. That she should be a part of every single thing for this wedding. 

Brides mom never responded to that text  but sends me a separate text stating she knew it was a friend's date. 

On the group chat ""A"" keeps making passive aggressive remarks towards ""T"" and myself. 

Luckily ""T"" and I did get our refund. We felt bad because no one was planning anything for the bride and she deserves a nice fun evening to relax. 

""T"" and I never fought with anyone over the group chat. I just hope this didn't ruin our friendship. 

I can't back out because Brides mom is paying for everyone for the activity they chose to do and already put a down payment late last night and is also covering everyone's dinner.

I have never had this happen before and I don't like people being upset with me. I just thought the painting thing would have been so much fun and it was not my intention on leaving everyone out. This was all ""No one is sharing anything or planning anything let's take you out!"" We was trying to be nice and I have never planned a party before my MOH and my aunt and my mom did for mine. All I had to do was tell my MOH who I wanted there. 

I'm not sure if this was a giant miscommunication thing but I feel like my relationships with Brides mom and siblings will not be the same. I am worried they are going to be angry with T and myself for a long time.
