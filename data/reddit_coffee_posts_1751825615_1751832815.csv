I've not had meaningful side effects beyond some indigestion and delayed bowel movements.

My basic approach (I find simplicity works for me)    
1) I strength train 2x a week full body, not significant failure.  I try to get 8-12k steps in each day.

2) I eat consistently and eat a load of protein, I look for ways to get more in my diet(I still have some fruit and greens most days).  I eat an amount that I think will fill me up and if I'm feeling hungry, I tend to go for a walk and let it simmer a bit.

3) I drink whatever water/diet soda/coffee until I'm not thirsty.

4) When I fail at one of the above, I get back on the horse and try agains the next day.

I've stress tested it through an Easter family dinner, out for a meal and concert, 8 days in Sicily(basically lived of granite and gelato)...

I'm aiming for 90kgs, but I may stop short of that as I'm a naturally broad guy, so i'm less worried about my exact BMI and more about how I feel and look...My only regret is that I didn't start sooner.",1,1751832666.0,MenOnThePen,0,1.0,False

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. As of I'm playing Cyberpunk. Destiny 2 too but not as much since the new expansion is a month out. And helldivers. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact.

Start your day early at the Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Montmartre. Watch the sun rise over the city from the steps ‚Äî a quiet, almost sacred moment before Paris wakes up. Then, wander the winding streets of Montmartre, grab a coffee at a corner caf√©, and discover where artists like Picasso and Dali once lived and worked.

2. Day Trip to √âpernay for Champagne

Hop on a train and head to √âpernay, the heart of Champagne country. Tour iconic Champagne houses like Mo√´t & Chandon, walk the legendary Avenue de Champagne, and enjoy tastings in ancient chalk cellars. It‚Äôs a perfect escape into sparkling indulgence ‚Äî and back in Paris by evening.

3. Badasstours Scooter Tour with Mark

Take a guided electric scooter tour around Paris with Badasstours ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt your typical sightseeing trip. Mark, the guide, brings the city to life with wild stories, historical twists, and hidden local gems. It‚Äôs laid back, funny, and surprisingly deep ‚Äî perfect for everybody. The scooters are easy to ride and the route is safe. 

4. Picnic at Canal Saint-Martin

Skip the crowds at the Seine and pack a picnic for Canal Saint-Martin instead. Loved by locals, this laid-back neighborhood is great for people-watching, sipping ros√©, and enjoying cheese and baguettes on the water‚Äôs edge. Stick around for the evening when the vibe turns lively and a little bohemian.

5. Night at Palais Garnier (Op√©ra de Paris)

Even if you‚Äôre not an opera fan, a night at the Palais Garnier is an unforgettable experience. The opulent architecture, golden interiors, and Marc Chagall ceiling are breathtaking. Catch a ballet or opera, or just take a self-guided evening tour ‚Äî either way, it‚Äôs pure Parisian magic.

I know how ridiculous that sounds.

But the truth is, I think about you every day. Not in the same sharp, aching way I used to‚Ä¶ but in quiet flashes. In songs I can‚Äôt skip. In late-night thoughts I don‚Äôt know how to silence. In coffee cups and empty seats and passing laughter that sounds a little too familiar.

‚ÄúFrom Thread to Theory: What AI, AGI, and Quantum Computing Actually Mean for Textiles‚Äù
July 6, 2025

Let‚Äôs clear something up, because apparently confusion still reigns in lecture halls, lab groups, and‚ÄîGod help us‚Äîfashion tech startups throwing around buzzwords like candy at a Gilmore dinner party.

We‚Äôre at the frontier of a textile revolution, and it‚Äôs not being driven by sewing machines or color palettes. It‚Äôs being driven by code, qubits, and a level of computational power that makes your summer internship look like preschool.

First, Artificial Intelligence (AI)

This is the entry-level stuff. We‚Äôve been using narrow AI in textiles for years. It analyzes consumer behavior, predicts fashion trends, detects defects in fabrics during manufacturing‚Äîall very ‚Äúlook mom, I automated a spreadsheet.‚Äù

Useful? Yes. Impressive? Marginally.
AI is like giving a computer a script and letting it run scenes it knows how to play. No improvisation. No insight. Just brute-force data analysis and pattern recognition.

Think: AI checks if a fabric has a tear. Great. But it doesn‚Äôt know why that tear matters or how to prevent it.

‚∏ª

Now Enter: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

This is what makes AI majors cry tears of inadequacy. AGI doesn‚Äôt just recognize patterns‚Äîit understands context, learns like a human, and adapts. In textiles, that means AGI can design fabrics that change based on their environment‚Äîhumidity, heat, motion‚Äîwithout being explicitly told how.

AGI in the lab? It‚Äôs programming a fabric to be breathable when you‚Äôre sweating and insulating when you‚Äôre freezing. Yes, that‚Äôs real. And yes, it‚Äôs smarter than most group project partners.

AGI doesn‚Äôt just follow instructions‚Äîit rewrites them when the environment changes.

‚∏ª

And Then There‚Äôs Quantum Computing

Now we‚Äôre not just bending the rules‚Äîwe‚Äôre breaking the physics playbook. Quantum computing deals with qubits, which can represent multiple states at once. Translation? Insane processing power that can simulate molecular-level fabric behavior faster than any classical computer could dream of.

This lets us design entirely new fibers before we even touch raw materials. We can simulate how a hypothetical polymer would stretch, conduct heat, or self-heal‚Äîwithout wasting a single spool of thread.

Quantum simulation is to textile design what a nuclear reactor is to a campfire. It‚Äôs that kind of leap.

‚∏ª

Why This Matters

AI gets us efficiency.
AGI gives us intelligence.
Quantum gives us creation‚Äîthe ability to discover what hasn‚Äôt even existed yet.

We‚Äôre not just talking faster fashion. We‚Äôre talking wearable tech that adapts to you in real time, clothing that repairs itself, and fabrics designed for space, surgery, and survival.

So the next time someone in a pitch meeting tosses out ‚ÄúAI-powered textiles‚Äù like they invented it‚Äîpolitely (or not) remind them that if they‚Äôre not thinking quantum, they‚Äôre still stuck in the sewing circle.

You‚Äôre welcome.

INT. STARS HOLLOW KITCHEN ‚Äì MORNING

Lorelai pours herself a comically large mug of coffee. Rory sits at the table, flipping through her laptop. Paris bursts in, breathless, carrying a stack of papers and what looks suspiciously like lab goggles.

PARIS:
Okay, I need a fabric prototype, a neutral stimulus environment, and no one breathing within a five-foot radius unless you‚Äôre bringing me caffeine or Nobel-level insight.

LORELAI:
Good morning to you too, Einstein Barbie.

PARIS:
Don‚Äôt be cute. This is serious. I just ran a quantum simulation on a polymer mesh designed to respond to sweat-based thermal cues and self-regulate body temperature during hypoxic stress.

RORY:
Translation?

PARIS:
I made a fabric that breathes better than half the people at your high school reunion.

LORELAI:
Oh! So now we‚Äôve got AI yoga pants that judge our lifestyle choices?

PARIS:
No, Lorelai, we‚Äôre past AI. That‚Äôs like having a glorified Excel sheet call the shots. I‚Äôm using quantum simulation‚Äîqubits, entanglement, the whole Schr√∂dinger playset.

RORY:
Wait, I thought you hated cats.

PARIS:
Metaphorical cats, Rory. Try to keep up.

(She slaps a printout on the table: a molecular diagram that means nothing to Lorelai and everything to Paris.)

PARIS (cont‚Äôd):
This model‚Äîdesigned in a hybrid quantum-classical loop‚Äîlets me predict the structural resilience of textile bonds before they even exist. It‚Äôs like making the fabric in your head and watching it stretch, tear, and repair‚Ä¶ before it ever touches a loom.

RORY:
So‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre basically designing clothes from scratch using physics equations?

PARIS:
Not just physics. Post-classical physics. I am simulating creation, Rory. Literal Genesis in a lab. Day one: molecules. Day two: microfiber. Day three? Climate-adaptive evening wear.

LORELAI:
Let me guess‚Äîon day seven, Paris rested?

PARIS:
No, on day seven, Paris optimized fiber tensile strength for Martian colonization. There‚Äôs no rest when you‚Äôre reinventing the textile industry from subatomic principles.

RORY (grinning):
You‚Äôre kind of amazing.

PARIS (dead serious):
I know. Now, if either of you wants to be part of the first fashion line approved by NASA and Vogue, I suggest you learn to sew or get out of my way.

(She exits with the flair of someone who‚Äôs clearly plotting how to quantum-encode a trench coat.)

Review Inside!,"Testing out the Tastyle K320IT Single Serve Coffee Maker feels like becoming a barista without leaving my kitchen. This compact, vibrant purple gadget has been nothing short of an adventure for my coffee routines. With a small footprint, impressive brewing flexibility, and thoughtful design, it has offered plenty to love‚Äîthough not without a few quirks to consider.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was its sleek and space-efficient design. At just 9.3 inches deep, 4.6 inches wide, and 12 inches tall, it fits snugly on my cramped kitchen counter, leaving room for other appliances. The purple color adds a playful pop to the space, making it not just functional but aesthetically pleasing. Its lightweight build (weighing a mere 2.77 lbs) also makes it super easy to move around, whether I want it stationed in my kitchen or on my work desk for those all-day coffee-drinking marathons.  

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
The versatility of this brewer genuinely impressed me. It comes with four unique brewing modes: Hot, Bold, Over Ice Coffee, and Over Ice Tea. I tested all these, starting with Bold, which produced a fuller, more robust cup than other settings. Surprisingly, the Iced Coffee mode actually worked‚Äîit didn‚Äôt turn into some watery mess but delivered a flavorful cold brew for a perfect warm weather treat. The additional ability to brew tea gives it an edge over ordinary single-serve coffee makers. Having dedicated accessories for K-Cups, ground coffee, and tea ensures an excellent variety of options.

This machine supports brew sizes ranging from 6 to 16 ounces, so whether you‚Äôre an espresso shot kind of person or all about the massive travel mug, you‚Äôll feel right at home. I appreciated the one-cup reservoir setup; you only need to add water for the specific brew you want. The downside is that it isn‚Äôt removable, which is mildly inconvenient when cleaning it, but the visible water window compensates for this in day-to-day use.  

**Splash-Proof Design for Mess-Free Brewing**  
Clean counters make for happy mornings, and this coffee maker‚Äôs splash-prevent design does a brilliant job. Shorter cups benefit from a removable drip tray to avoid coffee splatter, and fitting a travel mug up to 7.3 inches is easy once you remove it entirely. After experiencing too many messy brews with older coffee makers, this feels like a win.  

**Built-in Maintenance Reminders**  
Knowing when to clean your coffee maker often feels like guesswork, but not with this device. The built-in descaling reminder ensures it stays in good condition without extra guesswork. Additionally, it‚Äôs BPA-free and has been constructed with safe materials, so health-conscious users (like my overly cautious sister) can breathe easy. Plus, it‚Äôs ETL certified, which might not excite everyone, but it‚Äôs additional reassurance for quality and safety.  

**Energy Conscious and User-Friendly**  
Saving energy feels good, and the automatic shutoff feature works like a charm here. It ensures the machine powers down after finishing its brew cycle, making it not just effective but kinder to your electricity bill. The simple button-operated design means no complex settings to figure out. Even my tech-averse colleague managed to master it within minutes of trying.  

**Positives**  
- Compact and lightweight design suitable for tight spaces  
- Multiple brewing styles for diverse preferences: coffee, tea, hot or iced  
- Simple maintenance with cleaning reminders  
- Splash-proof setup minimizes coffee spills  
- Energy-efficient with auto shut-off feature  

**Shortcomings**  
- Non-removable water reservoir requires extra care for cleaning  
- Lightweight construction might feel slightly less durable for long-term use  
- Brew temperature for iced options could use more optimization  

**Alternative Products**  
While this coffee maker brings a lot to the table, it competes with popular models like the Keurig K-Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Keurig K-Mini shares a similar compact design but lacks brewing versatility‚Äîno options for tea or cold brews, which gives the Tastyle K320IT a necessary edge. On the flip side, Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers a removable water reservoir and carafe option, which some might find more convenient, especially for groups.  

If you value variety and a compact design over bulkier, multi-cup brewers, this product shines brighter for individual users or small households needing a straightforward coffee maker with a splash of personality. It balances features and ease of use well, even if perfection isn‚Äôt achieved in every aspect.  

**Smart Spending**  
Pricing on this machine strikes a decent balance between affordability and features. Considering the inclusion of four unique brew styles and extras like maintenance reminders, it becomes an appealing choice for budget-conscious coffee lovers. It might not be the cheapest single-serve brewer out there, but the variety it brings justifies spending that little extra compared to more basic competitors. If versatility and compactness matter to you, this product is well worth its asking price.

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old Middle Eastern doctor, currently navigating the beautiful chaos that is life and medicine. I‚Äôm relaxed by nature, grounded in faith, and always trying to balance ambition with peace of mind. I‚Äôm here in the hopes of meeting someone kind, thoughtful, and genuinely interested in building a meaningful connection, ideally something that could grow into a life partnership.

When I‚Äôm not working long shifts or juggling hospital drama (the real kind, not Grey‚Äôs Anatomy), I‚Äôm usually out for walks, swimming, hiking when I can escape the city, or checking out new caf√©s and restaurants. I‚Äôm also a reader at heart; Murakami is my go-to, and if you‚Äôve read Kafka on the Shore, we‚Äôre already off to a great start.

Medicine is something I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about. It‚Äôs not just a career, it‚Äôs a calling, with all the highs and lows that come with it. It‚Äôd be amazing to meet someone who either shares that passion or at least understands what it‚Äôs like being in this field.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù, tan skin, black hair, brown eyes, and a light beard. I speak Arabic fluently, and I‚Äôd love to connect with someone who speaks another language too. I think being bilingual adds a unique layer to how we see the world and relate to others.

I'm looking to meet someone between 21 and 25. Someone who‚Äôs sincere, curious about life, and open to building something real. Bonus points if you‚Äôre kind, a little nerdy, or like long conversations over good coffee (or tea I‚Äôm flexible üòÑ).

If this resonated with you at all, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you messaged me with a bit about yourself and maybe a photo too. I‚Äôm happy to do the same.

Looking forward to hearing from you ‚ú®

1ltafrw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltafrw,Struggling with extraction of Bolivian beans.,"Hi everyone, I've only started to take espresso seriously only like 10 months ago when I bought a J Ultra grinder with my previous Flair Signature, and a F58 a couple months later. I've had really excellent shots with various coffees from all over South America, mainly Brazil and only tested one Ethiopian that was just mind blowing. But to be honest my last +8/10 shot has been in february and it's been mid ever since. Lately most roasters in my country Paraguay have been importing Bolivian coffee, since it's a neighboring country and I assume it's a bit cheaper than Brazilian coffee as of late. I don't know if I'm just inexperienced, or haven't developed my taste buds enough, or maybe the beans simply aren't that great. 

Don't get me wrong, they are by no means awful, they still come out good, just not excellent or outstanding. I haven't been able to identify any of the notes on the label despite trying everything I know. I mostly try to only adjust grind size and yield, sometimes I fiddle with temperature (most times I just stick with middle temp on the 58, sometimes high temp, water always boiling since I don't have an electric kettle), sometimes I modulate pressure, but in the end it's still nowhere near as good as the other coffees I've had when I just bought my machine. I don't get hung up on the 1:2 ratio with 25-30 shots, I drink everything even if it comes a bit too fast or too slow, I have tried turbo shots, preinfusion at 3-5 bar then full pressure until I get my desired weight with enought wiggle room and adjust from there, and still nothing. I wash my baskets and puck screens with every use, and every month a deep clean with puly caff. I even considered buying a ultrasonic cleaner lol.

What I've been seeing lately is that water is obviously important, and to be clear, I never tried bottled water or something like that. We don't drink tap water because it's undrinkable, we have 20 liter jugs of water delivered every week, and maaaybe the minerals are a bit messed up? However I've been able to pull really tasty shots with the same water before, so idk.

So I'm currently working as an apprentice for a master electrician in a company (non-union) I make $17 an hour and after taxes make about $590 per week.  $590 x 4 = $2,360 Monthly.  I also work at an animal shelter and make $14 per hour 32 hours per week.  $14 x 32 = $448 per week x 4 weeks = $1,792.  Total income $4,152.  Rent: 2k flat every month, Bills (auto loan, insurance, phone, Netflix/Xbox/all that stuff, child support as well): $1,060.  Gas/food: $600, Savings/coffee if I forget/rare if I don't cook sandwich on the job/new book: $60.

$4,152-$2,000= $2,152-$1,060= $1,092-600= $492-$60= $432

So $432 total gross income for savings I put away every month.  That's assuming I get the hours because some weeks we only get 3-4 days of work and I'm like fuck man I really needed that day of work.  $17 is a fair price to start I guess and I'm only 6 months in with no schooling, but I'm just scraping by working two jobs.  I am in Vermont like I said, no I'm not giving my exact location, but I want to put this out for any electricians in Vermont or worked in/know someone reliable who works in Vermont anywhere, relocation is not an issue.  Maybe green mountain power as a line worker?  Anybody hear anything good?  With 500 hours of on-the-job electrician training, being reliable, having a very strong background before trying to become an electrician with a very reputable employer, and no electrical school under my belt, but a proven strong hard work ethic that most employers probably want, unless they want the dude that sits on his phone with his whatever's more important all day instead of learning.  I'm not cocky, but I also know what I'm worth and at $17 an hour I'm questioning myself, I'm sure many master electricians have been in a similar boat making $14 an hour so I get it, however I'm still brought back to the fact that I'm not getting ahead I'm just getting by, which I just did for 4 years, so if there are any good or maybe better opportunities in VT that anyone has or knows of or what would be a good option in the state of VT. please let me know.

1ltad3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ltad3a/what_would_you_do_stay_or_go/,What would you do? Stay or go?,"Background info. We have two small kids, and we have been married 12 years. He moved out a few months ago, and I'm about to pay a retainer for a divorce attorney to start the process. I tried to get us marriage therapy, but he wouldn't fill out the paper work (I don't think he wanted to be told he was in the wrong by a professional) he hasnt brought up divorce specifically, and I don't think he has the funds for an attorney, but it's been 6 months so I should probably make some decisions. 

Reasons for contention: 

Our whole marriage I have been the breadwinner (except the last few years he has split the bills with me) before getting married he promised I'd be able to stay home while my kids were little and he didn't let me. I had to keep working because my job has paid insurance. 

He is terrible with money. When we got married I didn't know he had debt in collections (we were 22), and I ended up paying it off for him. He got a secret credit card last year to ""build his credit"". 

He stopped making an effort. He wouldn't take me on dates, be thoughtful, etc. 

He stopped going to church with me. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but in our culture it's a huge deal. I married him because he was a faithful man who loved Jesus, now he doesn't care. 

He refuses to get proper treatment or medical care for anything. Depression? Won't go to the doctor. Cavities? Let's his teeth rot even though we can afford fillings. 

He is on his phone CONSTANTLY. Like, gets home from work and scrolls until bedtime. If myself or my kids try to get his attention he yells and gets mean. I've tried to talk to him about it and he literally can't stop himself. It's so frustrating. 

He ended up watching a lot of p*RN in secret. Which is something against our religion. I was so turned off that I didn't want him to touch me anymore. Before we got married he actually said something to the effect of ""I am so glad I dated you. You're not my type physically, but I'm so glad I worked past that."" üò©

He put us last. He would go hunting every weekend in the fall and leave us alone at home. If I tried to do something like be in a theater production, he didn't want to support it,but if it's his hobbies they mattered. 

We live near my parents and he felt like my parents were meddling too much. 

We became like roommates raising kids we share. 

When he moved out it was very sudden, and he took half of our joint savings even though he never contributed a DIME to it. Like 20k just poof, gone.  

I love him dearly, and we had some really good times in our 12 year marriage. I didn't want to give up, but he doesn't want to do therapy and says that I'm the one who needs to change (I'm super bossy and have high expectations...)

What would you do!? I'm not going to beg him to stay, and I feel like I need to make the choice for the sake of my kids and my mental health. Do I cut it off clean? Hang in there? I was raised in a family where you don't throw things away, you fix them,but he's made zero effort other than bringing me the occasional coffee when he picks up the kids. 

Do I pay the retainer and move forward? It's expensive and I don't want my kids to be traumatized for life.

I know these places exist in Portland, just need your help. And, no, don't make me live out at Lloyd's Center. üòä",0,1751831478.0,PortlandOR,44,0.41,False

**The Shredder**

Cursing and muttering, Yang Hancheng threw a somewhat old-looking paper shredder onto the floor with a loud ‚ÄúCLANG‚Äù. He paid it no mind, flopped down onto the sofa, cracked open a Coke, and began to drink moodily.

Come to think of it, this shredder of indeterminate brand had been forced upon him. For some reason, Fatty Wang had gotten it into his head to organize a department-wide clean-up today, and this old paper shredder was discovered in a corner of the records room. Normally, something like this would either be thrown out directly or tossed into a storage room. But that damn Fatty Wang‚Äôs beady little eyes darted around, and he shoved it at Yang Hancheng, claiming it was an employee reward.

This shredder didn‚Äôt even have a power cord; it was pure junk. Besides, Fatty Wang was just a department manager. What right did he have to use company office supplies as a reward for an employee? Of course, the guy wasn‚Äôt actually trying to reward Yang Hancheng; he was just messing with him.

At that moment, Yang Hancheng really wanted to smash the shredder right into Fatty Wang‚Äôs greasy, fat face and curse, ‚ÄúReward my ass! You can shove it up yours!‚Äù. But when the words reached his lips, what came out was, ‚ÄúOh, how can I accept this? Thank you for your concern, boss,‚Äù followed by a broad smile as he carried the shredder back to his desk.

Yang Hancheng was a recent graduate, and Fatty Wang bullied newcomers. All the dirty and tiring work was given to him. If there was overtime, he was definitely roped in. He had to endure lectures for no reason, and when things went well, the credit went to Manager Wang; when mistakes were made, the fault was Yang Hancheng‚Äôs. For nearly a year, he had been a scapegoat more times than he could count. He had no idea why Fatty Wang had it in for him. Could it be a clash of fates?

Sometimes, Yang Hancheng wanted to slap himself. What a worthless coward. If you wanted to know what it meant to be meekly submissive, you just had to look at him. But there was nothing he could do. For someone who had barely graduated from a third-rate university, finding a job wasn‚Äôt easy. His family had no connections or background whatsoever. What else could he do but endure? He figured he‚Äôd stick it out for two years to get work experience, then jump ship. But even so, the resentment bottling up inside him was very real. Yet, what could be done? He had to bear it.

Still, Yang Hancheng didn‚Äôt know why he had brought the broken old shredder home. Thinking about it, though, he actually quite liked the idea of having a shredder to play with. For some reason, ever since he was a child, machines like shredders, juicers, blenders, and even meat grinders held a strange attraction for him. Watching things get pulverized inside a machine gave him a bizarre little thrill, a feeling that it was ‚Äúvery fun‚Äù.

But this shredder had no power cord; it was useless. He sighed, picked the machine up from the floor, and held it, examining it closely. It wasn‚Äôt very large, about the size of a small printer. It was black, with no logo on the panel, only a row of four buttons. To the left was a larger button, probably the power switch. But there were no icons on these buttons, let alone text. The shredder was even missing the collection bin for the paper scraps, leaving it a bare, rather pathetic-looking machine.

Yang Hancheng turned the shredder over and looked inside through the output slot. He saw rows of interlocking blades that gleamed with a cold light; they looked quite sharp. Yang Hancheng didn‚Äôt know what the inside of a shredder was supposed to look like, but this one seemed dangerous. The gear-like blades emanated an inexplicable chill.

However, as a nerd prone to moments of brain-dead impulse, Yang Hancheng, perhaps without thinking, subconsciously reached out to touch the blades.

‚ÄúHiss‚Äî‚Äù He sucked in a sharp breath as blood immediately began to stream from his finger. The gleaming blades were no joke; a light touch had instantly opened a cut.

Yang Hancheng put his finger in his mouth to suck on it. Thankfully, the wound wasn‚Äôt deep and soon stopped bleeding, but for some reason, the small cut hurt immensely. When he looked at the blades again, however, he saw no trace of blood.

He tinkered with the shredder for a while but couldn‚Äôt figure anything out. He randomly pressed the row of buttons and the power switch a few times, then tossed it back on the sofa. But just as he was about to get up and go to his computer, the shredder emitted a creaking and groaning sound and actually started up.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Yang Hancheng picked up the shredder and saw that the power button was lit up. It had really turned on. ‚ÄúDoes this thing run on batteries?‚Äù But he couldn‚Äôt find anywhere on the machine to install them; the entire casing seemed to be a single, seamless piece.

Yang Hancheng immediately grabbed a piece of paper from his desk and fed it into the top slot. With a soft ‚Äúzzzz‚Äù sound, the paper was quickly turned into a pile of shreds.

He was delighted. He couldn‚Äôt believe the shredder actually worked. He cleaned up the paper scraps, found a suitably sized cardboard box, and set the shredder on top of it, amusing himself with the pointless activity. He still didn‚Äôt know what the four buttons were for. He pressed each one, but there was no discernible difference in the shredded paper. But having acquired a free shredder, Yang Hancheng was no longer depressed.

This was just a tiny, insignificant episode in his life, and Yang Hancheng‚Äôs days continued as usual. Recently, however, something must have gotten into Fatty Wang, as he found fault with him every other day. It seemed that cursing at him a few times daily brought the fat bastard some kind of pleasure. Every time, Yang Hancheng would be meek and submissive, not daring to talk back. But in his heart, his resentment grew day by day. After work each day, he would feed a stack of old newspapers into the shredder, watching them get torn to bits, as if he were watching Fatty Wang being pulverized. It provided a certain cathartic release.

One day, just before quitting time, he was called into Fatty Wang‚Äôs office and berated again, simply because he had used the Yuanti font in a PowerPoint presentation. But it was Fatty Wang who had originally requested that font; now he was saying it should have been Heiti.

Listening to Fatty Wang rant, Yang Hancheng fantasized about kicking over his desk, jumping on him, beating him senseless, and then shoving a chair leg into his ear and standing on the chair to jump a few times. But this was only a fantasy.

With a grim face, Yang Hancheng left work, smoking two cigarettes outside the office building. The more he thought about it, the more furious he became. A deeply suppressed violent energy churned within him. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth, hailed a taxi, and headed straight for Fatty Wang‚Äôs house. He knew the address because he and another colleague had taken a drunk Fatty Wang home after a department dinner and karaoke session.

Fatty Wang lived on the first floor. Yang Hancheng‚Äôs original plan was just to smash a couple of his windows to let off some steam; given his courage and means, that was the most he could manage. But when he arrived, he found Fatty Wang‚Äôs cat lying lazily by the door. Yang Hancheng knew that despite Fatty Wang‚Äôs thuggish and overbearing demeanor, he truly loved this cat, constantly posting pictures of it on his Weibo.

Seeing no one around and Fatty Wang‚Äôs door closed, Yang Hancheng had no idea how the cat had gotten out. He slowly approached it. The plump tabby cat was surprisingly unafraid of strangers. It even turned to rub against Yang Hancheng‚Äôs hand, which was trembling slightly from nervousness. At that moment, Yang Hancheng, who had intended to break windows, had a rush of blood to his head. He scooped up the cat, turned, and ran.

After a mad dash, he jumped into another taxi. Just like that, Yang Hancheng had catnapped the animal. He felt both nervous and a thrill of revenge. He knew Fatty Wang treated this cat like his own son; now he would get a taste of this kind of pain. Of course, he didn‚Äôt intend to actually harm the cat. The little creature was quite cute, and it would be nice to keep it himself.

When he got the cat home, it finally sensed something was wrong and began to pace nervously around his apartment. Yang Hancheng didn‚Äôt have any cat food, so he prepared some rice porridge in a bowl for it. But the kitten wouldn‚Äôt even glance at the food. With no other options, Yang Hancheng left it alone, figuring it would eventually eat when it got hungry enough.

The kitten circled the apartment a few times and discovered the box on which the shredder was perched. It jumped into the box and pawed at the pile of paper scraps, perhaps mistaking it for a litter box. A moment later, it jumped out and climbed onto the shredder. When Yang Hancheng looked up from his computer, he saw the kitten extending a paw towards the paper feed slot.

Yang Hancheng stood up to get it down, but suddenly he heard a bloodcurdling screech as the cat was pulled into the shredder. It happened so fast that Yang Hancheng didn‚Äôt have time to react. The tabby‚Äôs front half vanished into the narrow feed slot, and its terrified screams stopped abruptly.

Granular debris began to spew from the bottom of the shredder‚Äîbits of flesh, fur, and white bone fragments. Fresh blood, mixed with what looked like brain matter, dripped down like water being wrung from a towel. A few seconds later, the entire cat had been turned into a pile of mince, lying quietly in the cardboard box. Blood slowly seeped up the side of the box from one corner.

Yang Hancheng stared, dumbfounded, at the entire process. His head spun, whether from the gory scene or some other reason, he didn‚Äôt know. He watched the horrifying process and the resulting image, feeling on the verge of vomiting, yet deep inside, a cruel thrill faintly surfaced.

He slowly walked over, smelling the pungent odor of blood, and looked at the shredder and the minced meat in the box. The black shredder sat there quietly, looking like a real piece of office equipment. But Yang Hancheng knew this shredder was definitely sinister. This wasn‚Äôt a meat grinder; how could it have shredded a cat so smoothly without jamming even once? And how could a feed slot this small have swallowed a whole, plump, living cat, leaving it no room to struggle?

Yang Hancheng stood there stunned for a long time, not daring to investigate the eerie shredder any further. Trembling, he could only put the box of minced flesh into a garbage bag and throw it out. Looking at the pile of blood-red meat and thinking that just half a minute ago it had been a lively, jumping cat, now turned into ground meat, made his stomach churn again. But at the same time, he felt a strange sensation.

Staring at the minced meat for a long while, Yang Hancheng slowly reached out his hand and plunged it into the pile, stirring it gently. It was still warm. He took a deep breath, gently kneading his fingers in the meat. It had a slick texture, with the slight sting of bone fragments. For some reason, the sensation made his heart race.

‚ÄúI should put this pile of meat on Fatty Wang‚Äôs doorstep‚Ä¶‚Äù the thought surfaced from the depths of his mind.

Of course, in the end, Yang Hancheng just threw the meat away. But a few days later, Fatty Wang showed no sign of having lost his beloved cat. He was the same as ever, shifty-eyed and cursing people out for no reason, especially Yang Hancheng. There was no change at all. This puzzled Yang Hancheng. The more Fatty Wang acted this way, the more uneasy he became. At the same time, the thrill of revenge seemed to have vanished. He even thought that if Fatty Wang truly didn‚Äôt care, the tabby cat had died for nothing.

Finally, Yang Hancheng couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. One day, seeing that Fatty Wang was in a good mood, he pretended to ask casually, ‚ÄúBoss, how‚Äôs your cat doing? I haven‚Äôt seen you post any pictures of it on Weibo lately‚Äù.

To his surprise, Fatty Wang glared at him. ‚ÄúCat? What cat? We‚Äôve never had a cat. What nonsense are you spouting? If you have this much free time, you‚Äôd be better off making a few more client calls. Let me tell you‚Ä¶‚Äù

Fatty Wang launched into another tirade. But Yang Hancheng didn‚Äôt hear a word of it. How was this possible? Everyone knew Fatty Wang had a cat, but looking at his expression now, he didn‚Äôt seem to be faking it. It was as if his family truly had never owned a cat.

After the lecture, Yang Hancheng quietly asked his colleagues in the department, but they all said that Fatty Wang had never owned a cat. Yang Hancheng clearly remembered that one of them, who also had a cat, had been discussing cat-rearing tips with Fatty Wang just a few days ago. Now, it was as if that conversation had never happened.

Yang Hancheng went on Weibo and scrolled through Fatty Wang‚Äôs posts, only to find that all photos and posts about the cat were gone. There was no hint in any of his writing that he had ever owned a cat. This made Yang Hancheng momentarily wonder: maybe Fatty Wang really never had a cat?

However, recalling the warm and slick feeling on his hands the other night, Yang Hancheng was sure it wasn‚Äôt a dream. But how could he explain the current situation?

‚ÄîCould it be that the terrifying shredder could not only pulverize the cat‚Äôs body but also shred all memory and records of its existence?

This thought made goosebumps erupt all over Yang Hancheng‚Äôs body. He couldn‚Äôt tell if it was from fear or a strange kind of excitement.

To test this theory, Yang Hancheng spent a few days finding an opportunity to lure his neighbor‚Äôs Golden Retriever back to his apartment. He placed a piece of meat on top of the shredder and watched the big dog from a distance. His heart pounded; he felt a mixture of excitement and fear. This dog knew him; they were neighbors on the same floor, and Yang Hancheng quite liked it. But now he was using it for an experiment. He didn‚Äôt know if he hoped the shredder could kill and erase all traces, or if he hoped it was just an ordinary shredder. He couldn‚Äôt even say if he wanted to see the Golden Retriever turned into mincemeat or see it unharmed.

In this state of extreme, contradictory tension, the Golden Retriever, blissfully unaware, happily ran over to grab the meat. It stood by the shredder, one front paw resting near the feed slot, and stretched its head to bite the meat. After eating the piece, it lowered its head to lick the meat juice off the shredder, getting closer and closer to the feed slot.

Finally, the dog‚Äôs nose entered the slot. Suddenly, Yang Hancheng saw the Golden Retriever‚Äôs head get squeezed flat as if by an invisible force, and then it was instantly sucked in. The dog‚Äôs body convulsed and struggled violently, but it was completely powerless against the bizarre shredder. It was quickly pulled in, bit by bit, and ground into a pile of meat pulp.

Yang Hancheng felt another wave of dizziness, as if his blood sugar had crashed. His vision went black, and he collapsed onto the floor. When he came to, he looked at the large box of minced meat and flowing blood, his body trembling as he gasped for air.

Yang Hancheng put the minced meat into two layers of garbage bags, ran far away to dispose of it, and then walked back, chain-smoking fiercely. Then, with a very anxious heart, he knocked on his neighbor‚Äôs door.

The neighbor warmly invited the ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù young man in. As Yang Hancheng chatted with his neighbor, he scanned the apartment‚Äôs furnishings. There was no dog bed, no food bowl, no leash, nothing. He clearly remembered seeing a small, house-like dog kennel from the doorway just half an hour ago. Now, in its place was a coffee table.

‚Äú...Maybe you should get a dog, to liven things up,‚Äù Yang Hancheng probed.

The neighbor laughed. ‚ÄúHaha, yeah, I‚Äôve been thinking about it. What do you think about a Golden Retriever? My wife really likes them, I just don‚Äôt know if having a dog is a hassle‚Ä¶‚Äù

Watching his smiling neighbor, Yang Hancheng let out a long breath.

Night fell. Yang Hancheng sat in the dark, smoking and staring intently at the terrifying shredder. This machine could pulverize things much larger than its feed slot, it could easily grind flesh and bone, and it could erase all evidence of a creature‚Äôs existence, including memories. In this world, besides him, no one would remember the creatures that had once existed but were now shredded by this machine.

‚ÄîWhat about a person, then?

The violence at the bottom of his heart suddenly spread through his body like ink dissolving in water. It seemed that watching the tabby and the Golden Retriever being shredded had watered that terrifying thing inside him, and it was now growing strong.

Yang Hancheng had an uncontrollable thought: if this applied to all living beings, he would become a truly ‚Äúlawless‚Äù man. He could make a person disappear, both in body and in existence. Anyone he disliked or couldn‚Äôt stand could be made to have never existed at all. No one would file a report, no one would investigate, and he would forever remain a law-abiding citizen.

‚ÄúHey, boss, it‚Äôs me, Little Yang. Um, well, you‚Äôve been taking such good care of me at work lately, and I feel bad. I‚Äôd like to treat you to dinner and a few drinks. What do you think?‚Äù

Late at night. After getting Fatty Wang about seventy or eighty percent drunk at a bar near his home, Yang Hancheng supported him as they staggered all the way back to his own apartment.

Yang Hancheng stripped Fatty Wang naked and tied him to a chair. Beside him, he laid out a kitchen knife, a saw, an electric drill, and pliers. Then he woke him up with a basin of cold water. When he came to, Fatty Wang was initially confused about where he was. When he realized he was tied up tight and saw Yang Hancheng‚Äôs red, savage eyes and the array of tools, he was about to scream, but his mouth had been sealed with packing tape. He could only make terrified muffled sounds.

Yang Hancheng took a deep drag from his cigarette, held it in, then slowly exhaled. No need to worry about legal consequences, no need to worry about being found out, and no need to worry about the victim‚Äôs family seeking revenge. This feeling was truly wonderful. At this moment, he truly felt that he had been vindicated.

Simply shredding Fatty Wang directly seemed too lenient. As he rolled up his sleeves, Yang Hancheng thought that besides cursing at him and making his life difficult, Fatty Wang hadn‚Äôt committed any unforgivable crimes like murdering his father or stealing his wife. But the accumulated frustration and depression of over a year had become a catalyst for the savage desires that had been growing wildly within him. He couldn‚Äôt control himself anymore. Besides, Fatty Wang was going to die anyway, and he had no interest in hearing why he had been treated so poorly. At this moment, he just wanted to use every means possible to torture this fat bastard.

Yang Hancheng used the kitchen knife to slice pieces of flesh from Fatty Wang‚Äôs body while Tchaikovsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúPath√©tique‚Äù Symphony played on the stereo. Yang Hancheng had no particular love for classical music, but he‚Äôd seen many killers in movies listen to it while murdering, so he decided to follow suit. It also served to cover up Fatty Wang‚Äôs whimpers. But as he listened, he began to feel there was a point to listening to a symphony at a time like this. It made him feel as if he were engaged in a highly artistic, almost sacred work. He wasn‚Äôt killing a man; he was completing a masterpiece, conducting a performance.

Yang Hancheng had set up an induction cooker nearby with a pot of oil heating on it. After carefully slicing off a piece of Fatty Wang‚Äôs flesh, he would drop it into the oil pot, fry it until it was golden brown, then scoop it out and arrange it on a plate nearby.

After slicing and frying for a while, Yang Hancheng grew bored and couldn‚Äôt understand why Hannibal Lecter enjoyed it so much let alone wanting to eat his victims. He gave up. He thought for a moment, then put down the knife, picked up the electric drill, and drilled several-inch-deep holes in Fatty Wang‚Äôs stomach. Then he tilted the chair back so he was lying flat, picked up the pot of oil, and carefully poured the boiling liquid into the small holes.

Fatty Wang‚Äôs entire body convulsed violently. He could no longer even whimper. Feces and urine soaked the floor. Yang Hancheng took a breath; the air was filled with a strange mixture of fragrant meat, blood, and stench. He looked at the twitching Fatty Wang on the floor and felt a peculiar sense of greatness. Amidst the symphony, he found a few candles, stuck them into the holes on Fatty Wang‚Äôs body, and lit them. It was as if Fatty Wang were a still-trembling birthday cake.

From today on, Yang Hancheng thought, he would never swallow his anger or be a coward again. Today was the day of his rebirth. He should celebrate his new birthday. Yang Hancheng silently made a wish, happily blew out the candles, and continued his work.

A long time later, Fatty Wang was in pieces, but miraculously, he was still alive. This astonished even Yang Hancheng. He wasn‚Äôt a highly skilled killer with knowledge of medicine or anatomy; to have achieved this much was quite something. Of course, the pot of boiling oil had served as an excellent styptic when he had cut off Fatty Wang‚Äôs limbs; otherwise, he probably wouldn‚Äôt have survived this long.

He finally untied Fatty Wang. He grabbed the shredder, first pulverizing the severed limbs and other miscellaneous pieces of flesh, and finally, he shoved Fatty Wang‚Äôs head into it.

Fatty Wang was turned into minced meat within ten seconds. But at the same time, Yang Hancheng suddenly felt a massive wave of dizziness. He could even clearly feel his life force rapidly leaving him. Before he had time to wonder why, he collapsed into the pool of blood on the floor.

At that moment, two figures appeared in his room. One was a somewhat burly middle-aged man with an ordinary face, wearing a courier‚Äôs uniform. The other was a handsome young man dressed in a well-tailored, dark grey pinstripe suit, a crisp white shirt, and a narrow, light purple tie.

The middle-aged courier looked at the blood on the floor and the seemingly lifeless Yang Hancheng, shaking his head with a ‚Äútsk tsk.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis kid is pretty ruthless, a real piece of work‚Äù.

The handsome young man carefully maneuvered his shiny leather shoes to avoid the minced meat and blood on the floor. He carefully picked up the shredder, which was completely free of any bloodstains. ‚ÄúAlright, Old Zheng, this most important piece, the shredder, has finally been recovered. We still haven‚Äôt found the mask, but that thing is too hard to find and not that important anyway. The higher-ups said to forget it. So, our mission is finally complete. Phew, thankfully this guy happened to drip a drop of his blood essence on it, otherwise the shredder wouldn‚Äôt have activated, and where would we have even started looking?‚Äù

He paused, then added, ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs an idiot. How could you activate a super weapon like this without paying a price? Erasing cats and dogs doesn‚Äôt involve much, so he should have stopped there. But no, he just had to kill a person. With your meager life essence and vitality, do you think that‚Äôs enough to shred a person‚Äôs entire causal chain? You‚Äôd probably use it all up and still not have enough‚Ä¶‚Äù

The middle-aged courier, Old Zheng, nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true. I just wanted to see how far he‚Äôd go. I didn‚Äôt expect him to actually dare. This kid could have been recruited into the organization; he‚Äôs ruthless and twisted enough. But unfortunately, he‚Äôs brainless. He already felt something was off when he was killing the cat and dog but didn‚Äôt pay it any mind. Well, he deserved to die. But this shredder is truly terrifying. I still haven‚Äôt figured out its principle of operation‚Äù.

The handsome man, having put the shredder away somewhere, sat down on the sofa and listened to the symphony. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it; I don‚Äôt understand it either. But my old man used to say that any art or technology, when taken to its ultimate conclusion, will ascend to the level of philosophy. Philosophy is the study of the essence and principles of this world. The many research projects on arts within the organization are all aimed at this goal. This shredder is one of the technology department‚Äôs most advanced achievements. This kid couldn‚Äôt even activate its other functions. These four buttons aren‚Äôt just for show‚Äù.

Old Zheng nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true. But Little Tang, don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but to be able to use this shredder, I‚Äôm afraid only Little Qin‚Äôs leak-proof doll could do it. The life essence and vitality of those dolls are countless times that of a normal person. Being ageless and undying, they can supply this big essence-eater. We wouldn‚Äôt dare to use it ourselves; it‚Äôs too damaging‚Äù.

The handsome man, Little Tang, snorted and muttered, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so great about that? Maybe Brother Song‚Äôs peanut people could also do it‚Ä¶‚Äù

Old Zheng chuckled and didn‚Äôt pursue the topic. After a pause, he added, ‚ÄúBy the way, Little Tang, could you ask Old Master Tang to help out and get the higher-ups to assign more manpower? Look at us in the External Affairs Department; we‚Äôre not the Special Operations Department or the Intelligence Department. We all have our day jobs to do, and there‚Äôs so much to handle that we have to find time to track down these lost items. We‚Äôre spread too thin. Several of my fruit trees are about to be ready for harvest‚Äù.

Little Tang pursed his lips. ‚ÄúForget it, I‚Äôm not going to touch that hornet‚Äôs nest. Besides, my old man is in the technology department, not the personnel department. He can‚Äôt do anything about it. You think I don‚Äôt want more people? I have several musical instruments that are almost finished, too. Seriously‚Äù.

After grumbling for a bit, Little Tang lowered his voice. ‚ÄúBut speaking of which, manpower in the organization has been really tight lately. Did you know? The guy who lost these things didn‚Äôt get taken out on an external mission; he defected from the organization! Think about it, why would you need to bring a shredder on an external mission?‚Äù

Old Zheng was startled and instinctively lowered his voice as well. ‚ÄúNo wonder! He took the essence-eating paper fish, which can get past all sorts of barriers, and he took the mask, and some other things, plus the shredder. I thought it was for some major mission, wondering which big shot they were planning to take out‚Ä¶ So, it turns out he was a defector?‚Äù

Little Tang said, ‚ÄúExactly. But he really didn‚Äôt understand the organization‚Äôs methods. Special Ops didn‚Äôt even take the case. Just Internal Affairs sent two people and got it done. But I heard it‚Äôs not that Special Ops didn‚Äôt want to handle it‚Äîyou know how they like to stick their noses in everything‚Äîbut that they seriously couldn‚Äôt spare anyone. And after the people from Internal Affairs dealt with that guy, they didn‚Äôt even have time to recover the scattered items before they had to rush back to their other duties. So tell me, where are they going to find extra people for us? Oh, and by the way, my old man told me this privately. You absolutely cannot spread it around‚Äù.

‚ÄúOf course, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Old Zheng said, patting his chest. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ things have flared up again?‚Äù

Little Tang chuckled. ‚ÄúThat, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

Old Zheng squinted at Little Tang and also smiled. ‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs none of our External Affairs business anyway. Hmm, no wonder the higher-ups have been rushing the fruit tree harvest lately. These are all consumables, right? Hey, even though External Affairs has a lot to do and a low status, we‚Äôre free and easy. If there‚Äôs a headache, the freaks at the top have to deal with it, right? Why else would Old Master Tang send you, his precious son, down to External Affairs to get some experience?‚Äù

With that, Old Zheng and Little Tang looked at each other, both chuckling. They sauntered out, leaving behind a floor covered in bloodstains, a pile of minced meat, and the body of Yang Hancheng, long dead, his life essence and vitality completely drained.",1,1751831419.0,ExtremeHorrorLit,0,1.0,False

Apologies for such a long story, initially I wanted to post in two parts for easy reading and digestion but mods would not allow and removed part one.



There is just so much to this story, I‚Äôm being as succinct as I can!!!
I just really want to share with you all! 



Part 1


So just to preface this - I don‚Äôt do dog sitting professionally but since I am a freelancer who works from home, by word of mouth I‚Äôve been recommended and therefore have been seen as a stable & steady dog sitter. My schedule is super flexible and I could be anywhere as long as I brought my laptop and graphics tablet. It‚Äôs a nice side quest for me, since my work (as a graphic designer) makes me quite sedentary and lonely it‚Äôs really nice to have a furry friend for company and force me to take breaks throughout my day, go for a walk and touch some grass. And of course the extra money is a bonus!

So this was a little while ago - At this point, I‚Äôve dogsat a whole bunch of doggies of all various sizes, from pups to seniors. Also had a few repeat clients. I‚Äôve never had dogs myself but I grew up around them, my grandfather had a pair of German shepherds and my aunt till this day has a gang of fluffy white shitzhu‚Äôs. I was confident in my ability to take care of pretty much any kind of dog.

Some friends of my parents approached me and asked if I could dogsit their border terrier, he was a little over a year old. He was a pandemic puppy. I‚Äôd met him and played with him a few times before. Also been to said couple‚Äôs house for dinner too! They were a busy professional couple with extremely demanding jobs. So I wasn‚Äôt about to pass any judgement on the state of their house from the little I saw of it previously. Although now in retrospect, I had only been to their kitchen/dining room area and garden (keep this in mind for later). I agreed to take on their dog and house sit. It‚Äôs what I usually do since I have a cat and boyfriend stays with cat. Although smaller dogs/cat friendly pups often stay in my house because my cat is super chill.

They were going away for just over two weeks. Also since they were family friends, I wasn‚Äôt expecting any money and was happy to do this for them! From the very moment I arrived, there were just red flags everywhere. I stood in that living room and realised there were piles and piles of the woman‚Äôs clothes covering every surface. Every single armchair was just heaps of clothes. I noticed that some of the clothes touching the floor had sort of yellow stains.

They ran me through the dogs feeding instructions and said ‚Äúwell he doesn‚Äôt really eat these packets of dog food that we buy. He does eat smoked fish though, so maybe you could get him some of that. Also you can just throw him some of your snacks, he eats crisps and crackers‚Äù I was shocked - I just nodded but there is no way I‚Äôm feeding dogs human snack foods.

After talking me through all that I needed to know. They left for their holiday. I brought a small suitcase,cabin sized tiny thing  which I took up to the bedroom. As I walked up the stairs I realised again, every possible surface was filled with piles of clothes. The banisters were covered in heaps, the stairs had piles. The corridors had hooks but there were so many coats hung that you had to fight them to walk through. The doors had tonnes of clothing hung on them to the point where you could not close any of them. I got to the bedroom and noticed‚Ä¶ there was no floor space for me to even put my tiny suitcase. Again there were piles of clothes and shoeboxes that were stacked from floor to ceiling (no exaggeration they touched the ceiling!!!) heaps of shoes just in little mountains everywhere. Shopping bags, still with things in them. Unopened parcels everywhere. I decided to have a look around, get used to my surroundings a bit, went into the bathroom and bam! More shoes! More clothes and‚Ä¶ beauty products. More than you can imagine! Every surface crammed with products. There must have been 100 face creams, serums, toners all around the sink. The windowsill was crammed with product. The surface areas around the bath tub overflowing with bottles and tubes of product. I pushed the clothing hung on the shower to one side so I could take a peek of the shower and yes, you guessed it. Loads and loads of bottles, on the floor and only just enough space for your two feet to stand. It doesn‚Äôt stop there, every shelf had a sort of basket that was over flowing with more beauty products. I have never seen so much stuff in my life. By this point I was starting to question how these 17 days were going to pan out.

I wondered back downstairs to the living room and had a little look around, the heaps of clothes had been peed on by the dog. Clearly they had no idea because they didn‚Äôt touch them and just kept throwing more on the pile. I sat down on the sofa to take it all in and the tower of books on the side table collapsed on me and I knew then that it was only going to be downhill from here on out.


Part 2


I wandered downstairs to the kitchen, there was so much clutter everywhere it was starting to stress me out. There is basically no empty surface areas in this house. So I decided to grab the doggo and go out for a walk.
Little did I know this dog has some real interesting quirks. 
He liked to lie down in the middle of the road when we would cross and refuse to move even when there were oncoming vehicles.
He also loved jumping up at people from behind, especially women?! 
I have never had to apologise so much in my life because these ladies would shriek thinking some perve was pawing at their bum. 
Walking this dog was stressful and mortifying.


Once back in the house, I realised there is really no space for me to work. Their study was full of stuff too, towers and piles of books, more crates of skincare, more piles of clothes. There was a small sofa in there and you guessed it over loaded with clothing and coats.
Every bench, table and chair was occupied with clutter. 

The dog was super energetic and I would pick up some toys to play with him, but after throwing some plushies around and playing fetch with him I noticed some little things crawling on the toys. I looked closer and found tiny maggots coming out of the rips. I was so scared!! I didn‚Äôt touch the toys again, I just found a tennis ball and played with that for the rest of my time with the doggo, even though he kept bringing me these plushies. I started becoming afraid of touching anything in this house.

The tv didn‚Äôt work, a lot of lightbulbs in the house were blown so in the evening everything plunged into darkness and I was tiptoeing around with my phone torch on. 

When it came to meal times for the doggo, I fed him as instructed but they were right. He refused to eat. I messaged them to tell them that he wasn‚Äôt eating after day 2. They didn‚Äôt seem concerned. Sometimes dogs get a little stressed with new people, so I chalked it up to that and gave it another day.
He still wouldn‚Äôt eat, so I messaged them again, only for them to couple to reply with ‚Äúyou can go to XXXXXX and buy smoked fish. He eats fish from there ‚Äù.
And 
‚ÄúThere are some sausages in the fridge you can cook for him‚Äù
Firstly, they didn‚Äôt leave me any money for this nor did they offer to reimburse me.
Secondly the shop they suggested is quite a high end fishmongers, it‚Äôs not cheap.
Thirdly I looked in the fridge and found the sausages they had suggested but they had already extremely expired. The packet was so bloated from the gas build up. I didn‚Äôt think it was safe to just throw them in the bin, popped the plastic and saw the sausages were basically slime. In the end, I brought some bacon flavoured dog treats and hid them in the food to force him to eat. 


This led me to look into the fridge. Everything was mouldy, it was filled with takeaway boxes with like one bite of food left , one chip or one spoon of rice, everything covered in mould. I looked inside jars and saw colours and textures that didn‚Äôt look safe. Plastic bags of herbs and veggies that had turned into slimy goo.
There were (I‚Äôm not joking) 7 Philadelphia cream cheese tubs in there, each tub had been used once probably and gotten lost in the never ending expanse of takeaway boxes.
The cheese was no longer a white creamy colour, rather shades of blue and green and grey .
I felt so ill thinking about all those growths in the fridge I no longer wanted to keep my food in there. I lived on instant noodles for the remainder of my time there.

I had cleared a little space on the kitchen table for me to work and eat. Because there was no where else I could hang out in the house.
But as I would sit there , sometimes I heard squeaking. I thought I was hearing things. But in the night I could hear movement in the walls.
One day as I was standing at the sink doing the washing, a mouse ran over my foot.
I smashed the dog bowl because I was so startled. It really felt like I was living in a house of horrors. 

I tried to stay outside as much as possible with the dog. Long long walks, getting coffee, sitting in the park.
But this little guy, would get extremely aggressive at other dogs, bark and growl at people, lunge at children. I don‚Äôt really think he was socialised properly.
He also loved dragging me into oncoming traffic. A simple walk was often a battle.


When it came to bedtime, the doggo would jump onto the bed and attack me. 
Bite my arms, nip at my face. I know some dogs are playful, but he drew blood a few times. 
The doors were heavily laden with clothes, so it wasn‚Äôt like I could close the door. 
I would lie there, surrounded by the hoarding with a dog jumping around on me trying to eat me. 

This is how I lived for over two weeks.



(The handover of the dog on their return was also over complicated and extremely strange but I think that‚Äôs enough for now lol. It‚Äôs a whole other saga that made me cry. And I just hope and pray that no one has to experience anything similar to me! Godspeed fellow pet sitters!!)

1lta7aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1lta7aj/how_to_reconfigure_stadium_between_7th_and_main/,How to Reconfigure Stadium Between 7th and Main,"[Crude drawing of the idea](https://preview.redd.it/0i7fj6h5oabf1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ba4e39b7ed2c205c215fdfba3abe060b7e834ac)

In the time honored tradition of playing Cities Skylines with real cities, I was thinking how we might improve Stadium Boulevard by Pioneer. The interesting thing about this particular segment is that there is a lot of undeveloped space to the south of the current right-of-way. 

What I'm proposing:

* We repurpose the current westbound lanes as a local two lane street.  (Sort of like how the Nixon was rerouted to create a service drive between Huron Parkway and Bluett.) 

[Nixon Service Dr and Nixon](https://preview.redd.it/eeuw9e6n3bbf1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=01dd0ab28b954a65ba2e93cf293d57f7f4feba9e)

* Build a little connection between this ""new"" street and Snyder Ave just west of Drip coffee house on mostly vacant lots, making our new street a proper street and not just a service drive. 
* Fill in the northern most eastbound lane (or turn lane) with a berm similar to how the service drives along Eisenhower are separated from Eisenhower proper in Georgetown.

[Eisenhower with Berms separating the Service Drives](https://preview.redd.it/a2f0jtdc4bbf1.jpg?width=985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7670f3b13b13d2ed4fdf164479fcc9ca7c41790)

* Have two west bound lanes to the south of that
* Put in a 30' median with ""Michigan Lefts"" for traffic turning left into Pioneer or left out of Pioneer.
* Add two new east bound lanes to the south of that. 
* A new roundabout at 7th and Stadium

Why I like this approach:

* The new local street eliminates all the turning movements into local driveways, making the arterial much safer. It would also--I think--make living in the houses along Stadium more pleasant. 
* The 30' median would make crossing stadium on foot \*much\* safer since a pedestrian would be only crossing one direction of traffic at a time. Think of the boulevard as a very large pedestrian island. If you don't believe me, try crossing Packard on foot at the flashing beacon by Cobblestone Farm. It feels \*very\* safe since you're only crossing 2 lanes at a time, and they're both going in the same direction.

[Packard at Cobblestone Farm ](https://preview.redd.it/lmoosdscvabf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b82b9994b854f21dc84826298615867d8409f5d)

* By adding the new local street, we've eliminated all the curb cuts on the north side of Stadium which means we could have an honest-to-goodness real protected bike lane there with a continuous barrier. (Practically speaking, we'd probably want the westbound bike line to be on the north side of the berm, i.e. on the local street, but the point stands, it'd be a protected bike lane from the traffic on Stadium.) 
* It's very non-destructive. No houses would need to be torn down. Just the little barn behind First Merchants Mortgage Center on Snyder Ave. The right-of-way would need to be acquired from the school, but Pioneer sits on an entire quarter section and has 147 acres. This would not cramp the school in any way. 
* It preserves to road capacity of this segment of  Stadium. (If you're wondering if we need this capacity or why two lanes in each direction instead of one, the answer is emergency vehicles would need a way to get through when regular vehicles pull over.) 
* The roundabout should slow down the through traffic, while keeping it steady.
* Stadium Boulevard would actually have a section with an actual boulevard.

Anyway, that's my little fantasy map. It will never happen, but I think it'd be a good solution for this bit of of the road. ",3,1751831228.0,AnnArbor,0,0.8,False
1lta6l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystock/comments/1lta6l7/penny_stock_penny_story_2/,"Penny Stock, Penny Story - 2","Over all these years trading penny stocks, my single biggest loss came from a stock called RVV. I first got into it through margin financing via my brokerage firm, buying in at around $0.05. At the time, I still had some cash on hand, so I was actively buying and selling different plays.

RVV was a biotech company working on a treatment for arthritis. Back then, I didn‚Äôt even know what the company did. The broker would send me a message like, ‚ÄúHey, want in on a new financing deal?‚Äù and I‚Äôd just say yes without thinking or researching.

But then something unexpected happened‚ÄîRVV suddenly became the most exciting stock in my entire watchlist. Why? Because of COVID-19‚Äîa time the world will never forget, even if it‚Äôs slowly fading from memory now. During the pandemic, there were no effective treatments or vaccines initially. People were dying, and fear was everywhere.

RVV‚Äôs arthritis drug suddenly got linked to COVID treatment potential. The FDA fast-tracked the drug, allowing it to skip Phase II and go straight into Phase III trials. Once this news broke, the stock skyrocketed‚Äînearly hitting $1.00 per share. That was a 20x return from my original buy-in.

I didn‚Äôt catch the absolute peak, but I sold my position between $0.60 and $0.70. After that, the company stalled. There were no updates on their drug trial, and the price drifted back to around $0.50. I began doing my own research, reading everything I could, even speaking to some friends in the industry. After all that, I convinced myself the company had a decent shot at approval.

So I went all in.

Every last dollar I could pull together went into RVV around the $0.50 range.

Looking back, it‚Äôs astonishing how naive and reckless that decision was. The company needed a sufficient number of trial participants and data submissions. I checked the FDA trial site every single day, hoping for updates. But the progress stalled‚Äîalmost no new data was posted.

To make things worse, other COVID treatments and vaccines were hitting the market, getting fast approvals. RVV just couldn‚Äôt keep up. Eventually, it became clear the company wasn‚Äôt going to make it. The stock crumbled. I lost 80‚Äì90% of everything I‚Äôd put in.

The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù news? The company didn‚Äôt go bankrupt. It‚Äôs still trading today‚Ä¶ at $0.02. If you‚Äôre curious, you can probably still find one of my overly optimistic posts about RVV on Reddit from back then.

‚∏ª

I once heard a radio commercial from a debt relief company. A soft voice asked:

‚ÄúAre you facing a painful decision? A failed investment? A broken marriage?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how many people will read this post. I often browse this sub and deeply admire the wisdom and passion shared by others. As someone who‚Äôs been in the penny stock trenches for years, let me be blunt:

Yes, there are chances to strike gold here, but more often, it‚Äôs a minefield of traps‚Äîfull of blades and bottomless pits. My personal rule? Only invest what you‚Äôre absolutely willing to lose. And once I do invest, I go all in on 1 or 2 stocks. No diversifying, no hedging. It‚Äôs win big or lose it all.

‚∏ª

After the RVV disaster, I turned back to that bulletproof armor company I mentioned in Part 1. I asked my broker if it was still worth holding. He said yes‚Äîand hinted that the company might be acquired. Clinging to that hope, I dumped every last cent into it.

But fate has a way of kicking you when you‚Äôre down. Right after I loaded up, the company was halted from trading. Then the announcement came: the company was shutting down. The stock I bought became worthless overnight.

‚∏ª

Everything I‚Äôve written here is from personal experience. Looking back, it‚Äôs clear how small and helpless we are when caught in the gears of fate. If you‚Äôre just starting out and dreaming of making a fortune in penny stocks, I hope this post offers some perspective: most of these stocks will go to zero.

So why do I keep coming back? Because sometimes, just once or twice, you get that miracle. You hit that one trade that makes it all feel worth it. And like many, I keep chasing that moment‚Äîhoping to grab fate by the wrist one more time, and never have to worry about rent, food, or coffee again.

‚∏ª

After repeated wipeouts, I lost faith in the brokerage firm. I moved all remaining funds into my personal account. There wasn‚Äôt much left‚Äîjust a bit over $20K in my RRSP (Canada‚Äôs retirement savings account). Over the last two years, I‚Äôve focused my trading there.

I bought a Mexican dollar store stock (PESO) and a European REIT (INO-UN). I first heard about PESO during its private placement at $1.00 per share, but couldn‚Äôt get in at that price. It went public and dropped hard. I bought in around $0.10. INO-UN was trading near $10.00 but got wrecked during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Its revenue plummeted, it couldn‚Äôt pay dividends, and the price collapsed to under $1.00. I bought at $0.95.

Both stocks were incredibly sluggish. Dead money. I sold them shortly after.

‚∏ª

In the last two years, I‚Äôve cut every unnecessary expense. I stopped buying lunch. Stopped my daily coffee habit. Every dollar saved became ammo‚Äîquietly building up for the next opportunity that might either surprise me with joy, or destroy me again.

Life goes up and down. After a string of devastating losses that nearly wiped me out, I finally caught a break. After years of bleeding, I finally made a big win.

Most of our customers were regulars, and I quickly learned their routines, even down to the hour they'd walk through the door. Among them was a group of older gentlemen who seemed to believe the world revolved around them. They expected immediate service the moment they sat down, assuming I'd magically know their drink order‚Äîa latte, even if they just grunted ""coffee.""

Other waitresses often caved to their demands, serving them on a whim. But I wasn't about to. My policy was simple: wait your turn. So, when they'd arrive, often during peak hours, they'd sit and wait. I'd continue serving other customers, sometimes with three tables ahead of them.

One day, as I walked past their table, one of the gentlemen grabbed my hand and started shouting that he was waiting and wanted his coffee. I looked down at him, my gaze unwavering, and coldly told him to wait his turn before continuing on with my work.

They were, predictably, furious. They complained to my boss, who started lecturing me about them being a ""priority"" or some such nonsense. My response was blunt: ""That's funny. Not gonna happen. They'll wait their turn, just like everyone else. If that‚Äôs a problem you can come work just for them and serve them as soon as they arrive‚Äù.

The next time I saw them, I walked directly to their table and informed them that complaining to my boss hadn't changed a thing; they'd still have to wait their turn like everyone else. Surprisingly, I never had a problem with them after that.

1lta4hy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lta4hy,"Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp","**Why This Orange-Matcha Combo Actually Works**

Look, I'll be honest ‚Äî when I first heard about a **Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp**, I was skeptical. Orange and matcha? It sounded like one of those trendy flavor combinations that looks pretty on Instagram but tastes like a mistake.

But here's the thing: I was completely wrong. After weeks of experimenting in my kitchen (and drinking way too much caffeine in the process), this unlikely duo has become my go-to morning ritual. The earthy bitterness of matcha actually balances beautifully with bright citrus notes, and the creamy base ties it all together in a way that's surprisingly sophisticated.

üëâ *Want the full recipe breakdown and my tested technique?* [*Check out my detailed guide here*](https://www.amgroyal.com/matcha-orange-latte-a-zesty-creamy-wake%e2%80%91up/) *‚Äî it includes the ratios that actually work and the mistakes to avoid.*

**The Ingredient Quality Game-Changer**

Here's what I learned the hard way: not all matcha is created equal, and it makes or breaks this drink. I started with grocery store matcha powder (*you know, the stuff that's been sitting on the shelf for who knows how long*), and honestly, it tasted like grass clippings mixed with disappointment.

The difference when I switched to ceremonial-grade matcha was night and day. Yes, it's more expensive, but we're talking about maybe 50 cents per serving versus 20 cents. The flavor is smoother, less bitter, and actually complements the orange instead of fighting it.

Same goes for the orange ‚Äî fresh juice makes all the difference. I tried it with store-bought orange juice once, and the added sugar threw off the entire balance. Fresh-squeezed gives you that clean, bright acidity that cuts through the richness without being cloying.

**The Texture Secret (That Nobody Talks About)**

Most people mess up the texture because they treat this like a regular latte. But here's the thing: matcha behaves differently than coffee or tea. It wants to clump, it wants to be bitter, and it definitely doesn't want to play nice with citrus if you're not careful.

The secret is in the order and temperature. I won't give away my full method here, but I will say this: if you're adding everything at once and hoping for the best, you're going to end up with a grainy, separated mess. The **Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp** needs a more thoughtful approach.

Temperature control is everything. Too hot, and you'll scorch the matcha and make it unbearably bitter. Too cool, and nothing blends properly. There's a sweet spot that makes all the difference.

**A Little History Lesson**

I went down a rabbit hole researching this combination, and it turns out citrus and green tea have been paired in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies for centuries. Not exactly this combination, but the principle is the same ‚Äî the acidity brightens the tea's natural flavors and aids digestion.

In traditional Chinese medicine, they believe green tea and citrus together help with energy balance and mental clarity. I'm not making any health claims here, but I will say my afternoon energy crashes have basically disappeared since I started drinking this regularly.

**My Personal Coffee Shop Revelation**

This whole **Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp** obsession started at a tiny coffee shop in Portland (*I know, I know, very on-brand*). The barista made me something off-menu when I complained about being tired of both coffee and regular matcha lattes.

At first sip, I was skeptical. By the third sip, I was taking notes on my phone. By the end of the cup, I was asking for the recipe (*which they politely declined to share*).

That's when I knew I had to figure this out myself. It took me about three weeks of trial and error, some truly awful attempts, and probably too much money spent on ingredients. But when I finally nailed it, I understood why that barista smiled when they handed it to me.

**The Morning Ritual Factor**

What I didn't expect was how this drink would change my entire morning routine. Making a **Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp** requires just enough attention and technique that it forces me to slow down for five minutes. It's become this weird form of meditation.

There's something about whisking the matcha, timing the milk steaming, and getting that perfect orange balance that centers me before the day gets crazy. Plus, the energy boost is different from coffee ‚Äî more sustained, less jittery.

I've started making it on weekends too, which surprised me. Usually, my elaborate weekday routines don't survive Saturday morning laziness, but this one stuck.

**The Bottom Line**

The **Matcha Orange Latte: A Zesty, Creamy Wake‚ÄëUp** isn't just another trendy drink ‚Äî it's legitimately delicious if you do it right. The combination shouldn't work, but it absolutely does. The key is respecting both ingredients and understanding how they interact.

To be honest, I'm still tweaking the recipe. Sometimes I add a tiny pinch of vanilla, sometimes I experiment with different milk alternatives. But the core combination has become a non-negotiable part of my routine.

It was late in the afternoon of the second day when North stirred awake.

He blinked slowly, his vision adjusting to the dim orange light leaking in through the blinds. He tried to move, but felt like someone had filled his limbs with molten lead. His arms wouldn‚Äôt lift, and when he tried to flex his fingers, they twitched once and went limp.

*Zombification.*

Inside him, millions of things were happening at once. His blood had slowed to sludge, much of it already dried in his veins. His heart had stopped beating. His lungs didn‚Äôt rise or fall. Breathing had become optional. Thousands of tiny and large changes were happening in his body as zombification continued; the blood in his veins had slowed to sludge; his heart stopped beating. He didn't need to breathe anymore as breathing had become more of an optional suggestion. Samewhile, his muscles stiffened into thick cords, ligaments pulled taut like dried rubber bands. His jaw clicked faintly as he tried to shift it. His bones groaned like rusted scaffolding. Everything was shutting down in stages.¬† The only saving grace was that his mind had already been taken over by zombie fungi spores, while the rest of his body tore itself down and rebuilt under the control of the mycelium spores slowly spreading through his brain like roots twisting into concrete.

Eventually he managed to push himself upright, but he could only get halfway before his back gave out and he was hunched over like someone had folded him in half. Taking one step forward felt like two metal parts grinding without any oil. At least as a zombie, he couldn't feel actual pain anymore.¬†

He leaned against the wall and dragged himself to the closet and pulled out two 3D-printed wrist watches lookalike, thick as bricks and strapped with overlapping metal bands. They looked like sci-fi prototypes, not wearable tech. Each one had three metallic prongs extending from the underside.¬†

North collapsed to his knees and slowly slid them onto each wrist, then pressed the activation panel. 

The pins hissed and embedded straight into his flesh.¬†¬†

A tingling sensation immediately spread through his entire body, like thousands of fire ants crawling under his skin and biting him everywhere at once. What was actually happening was controlled electrocution; enough voltage to kill a living person instantly was now coursing through his undead nervous system.¬†

The electrical stimulation would force his half-dead muscles to respond and let him move with something approaching normal speed until the zombification finished completely. He'd deal with fixing the shitty zombie motor control later. Right now, the devices were working perfectly; His body jerked upright like a marionette on strings, knees locking, shoulders pulling back. He gasped, not out of pain, but from the sheer intensity of it.

*Uhhh! Much better, clearly more adaptive than the last time...*

North ran his hand over his face, but he barely felt anything through his deadened skin. His apartment looked exactly the same as before, except now everything was wrapped in this eerie silence that seemed to stretch from inside his walls all the way out into the city.

The electrical devices strapped to his wrists had gotten his zombie body moving again, so he shuffled back to the living room where his friends had been partying what felt like a lifetime ago. They were all sprawled across the floor in various positions, going through the same transformation that had hit the rest of the world. The only difference was his Nuka Brain cocktail should've kept their minds intact while their bodies changed, unlike everyone else who'd just become mindless flesh-eaters.

The whole zombification thing was still a mystery to him, even after experiencing it multiple times. It was impossible to tell with naked eyes if someone was actually turning or just plain dead. His friends looked like they could go either way, and since he couldn't smell any decay yet, he had no clue whether they'd made it through or not.

*I hope they all survive this shit...*

Next, he walked toward his bedroom where Danielle and her friends had been hanging out during the party. He was genuinely worried about what he might find with the kids. The door was still cracked open from when he'd checked on them during the party, so he pushed it wider and stepped inside. All three teenagers were scattered across his bed looking completely lifeless.

Actually... not all three. The boy Adam was still breathing and looked kind of restless, like he was having a bad dream.

*Huh! He hasn't turned into a zombie... Oh shit, he's still tripping on the Nuka Brain...*

It hit North suddenly what had gone wrong. The boy was actually immune to zombie spores and thus was still completely human, just tripping balls while everyone was going through zombification. He didn‚Äôt know what Adam was seeing, but judging by the way his body twitched and the tension in his jaw, it couldn‚Äôt have been anything good.¬†

For North, when the drug took hold, he‚Äôd found himself drifting through a massive void, an endless space strung together by glittering spiderwebs stretching into forever. It had been beautiful in a terrifying, cosmic kind of way.

But Adam‚Ä¶ he might be seeing devils clawing through his head. There was no way to know how bad it actually was.¬†

*Hopefully, it‚Äôs nothing permanent‚Ä¶*

The drug had an effect similar to a nuclear bomb, except here, the human brain was ground zero instead of land. But this wasn‚Äôt the time to panic or regret.

*He‚Äôs dehydrated‚Ä¶*

North scrambled to the kitchen, moving as fast as his zombie body would allow. He pushed through the stiffness and grabbed several water bottles from the refrigerator before rushing back to the bedroom.¬†

Adam was soaked in sweat, his shirt sticking to his skin like he‚Äôd been left out in the rain. North gently pulled him upright and leaned him against the wall, then twisted the cap off the first bottle and pressed it to the boy‚Äôs cracked lips,, watching as water spilled down his chin and soaked through his shirt. His eyes continued to move rapidly under his closed eyelids like he was half-awake but still trapped in whatever nightmare was playing out in his head.

*I should‚Äôve been more careful‚Ä¶* North thought bitterly, holding the bottle steady.¬†

Making sure he had drunk enough, he decided to leave him in the room to recover on his own timeline rather than risk forcing him awake and potentially causing more damage. He didn't have any Narcan or other emergency drugs that might help counteract the psychedelic overload, which was a massive oversight on his part. But it wasn‚Äôt like he‚Äôd expected any of them to survive.¬†

In his last loops, he never found any of his friends. They were already gone by the time he became resourceful to look for them.¬†

Therefore, now all he could do was wait for everyone to wake up so they could and leave for a safe place.¬†No way in hell was he sticking around once the real shit started. His goal was to move early, avoid the hotspots. 

Soon, the city would turn into a complete war zone. From his previous loops, he'd learned that different areas became dangerous at different rates; some neighborhoods would be overrun with panicked survivors shooting anything that moved, while others would be crawling bloodthirsty zombie hordes and not to forget about aliens doing their weird experiments all over the place. His plan was to move systematically toward areas that would stay relatively safe for the longest time, avoiding both the human kill squads and whatever the aliens had planned for the early stages of their invasion.

North went back to his closet and started pulling out all the weapons and supplies he'd prepared earlier: Homemade grenades made from empty cola cans lined one shelf, while modified toy guns designed to fire those grenades sat on another.¬† Regular bullets were pretty much useless against zombies, so these improvised explosives were his best for actually obliterating groups of them.¬†

He spent a good hour sorting and dumping everything into five large backpacks that he could load up for his zombie friends to carry once they regained some of their consciousness.¬†

The setup wasn't perfect since he'd be babysitting a group of blood thirty, barely-conscious undead and one kid who was probably still seeing dragons or whatever nightmare the Nuka Brain had cooked up for him. But compared to going through this apocalypse alone again, having backup that could actually think seemed worth the extra hassle.

‚Ä¶

""Aaaaa! Aaaaa! Aaaaaa!""

It was somewhere around late afternoon when North heard loud shrieks coming from his bedroom, the sound cutting through the apartment's dead silence like a knife.

He immediately dropped what he was doing and rushed back to find Adam standing in the corner, pointing at Danielle and Emma's motionless forms on the bed while absolutely losing his mind. The kid was in full panic mode, his whole body shaking as he stared at what probably looked like two corpses to his drug-addled brain.

""Hey, hey,"" North raised both hands and tried to sound as non-threatening as possible, ""you need to stop screaming, okay?""

But his zombie voice only made things worse. 

Adam backed further into the wall like North had just stepped in with a chainsaw. 

His eyes, bloodshot, darted around the room like he was trapped.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not *moving*!‚Äù he yelled, voice shaking, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not breathing. I thought‚Ä¶ I thought. God,¬† you fucking killed them‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúListen to me, you need to stop screaming first,‚Äù North kept his movements slow and deliberate. Last thing he wanted was to trigger some full-blown panic spiral. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hurt anyone. They‚Äôre just unconscious. They‚Äôre gonna be okay.‚Äù

But Adam wasn't having any of it. His breathing was coming in short, panicked gasps as he pointed an accusatory finger at North.

""Bullshit! You're lying!"" Adam's voice was high and strained, but there was a sharp edge to it that reminded North of someone way older than thirteen. ""People don't just pass out like. You cleary done something to them, they are cleary dead!""

North tried a different approach, speaking as calmly as he could manage with his zombie vocal cords. ""Look, I know this sounds crazy, but the world is under attack right now. Aliens invaded and released some kind of virus that turns people into zombies. two,‚Äù he gestured toward the bed, ‚Äúand most of the world‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre infected. You woke up, so you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones.‚Äù

Adam's face twisted with disgust and rage. ""Are you out of your mind right now? Aliens? Zombies?"" What kind of sick freak are you? You probably spiked our drinks last night with roofies or something. Did you rape them? Is that what this is?""

North's eyes widened in shock at the accusation. The little shit was actually accusing him of drugging and assaulting girls.

""Jesus Christ, kid, why don't you take a deep breath?"" North took a step back, genuinely disturbed by how quickly Adam's mind had gone there. ""I'm trying to help you understand what's happening.""

""Don't give me that innocent act,"" Adam shot back, ""I've seen enough crime shows to know exactly what this looks like. Some creepy older guy, unconscious girls, and a bullshit story about aliens.""

North stared at him, stunned, the whole room spinning for a second, not because of his condition, but because this kid‚Äôs brain had just leapt straight off a cliff.

""You know what? Fine,"" North said, backing toward the door. ""You can come find me when you calm down and want to have a real conversation. The front door to the apartment is unlocked if you want to leave and take your chances out there.""

He paused at the doorway and looked back at Adam, who was still pressed against the corner like a trapped animal.

""But I'm warning you, don't stay in this room too long. Once those girls wake up, they might try to attack you and eat you. And before you ask, no, that's not a threat from me.""

Adam‚Äôs face curled into disbelief. ‚ÄúJesus. Eat me? You‚Äôre insane.‚Äù

North wondered if the kid had suffered some kind of brain damage from the Nuka brain (it was totally possible), but there wasn't much he could do to help. Adam would have to come to terms with reality on his own timeline. He was still yelling, calling him every name he could think of, threatening to call his parents and the cops, swearing he‚Äôd get him locked up for life.

North kept walking‚Ä¶

*Good luck with that*, he thought. *If you can find a phone tower that still works. If you can find a cop who‚Äôs still respecting the law‚Ä¶.*

After walking out of the bedroom, North went back to his preparation work. He'd been in the middle of tying everyone's hands with rope to prevent them from wandering off and attacking random people once they woke up. Even though his friends would retain some awareness of their actions thanks to the Nuka Brain, they wouldn't be able to control their urges to hunt and feed on living humans. That was just how the fungal infection worked; thus,¬† even if they were semi-aware, even if they knew what they were doing, the body still moved on instinct and instinct wanted flesh.

Adam must've gotten bored sitting in the corner because he eventually crept out of the bedroom and stood hovering at the doorway, watching North work.

""You killed all your friends too, didn't you?""¬†

North didn't even look up from Jake's wrists as he secured the knots. If he could still roll his eyes, he definitely would have. ""The front door's still open if you want to leave. Otherwise, stop bothering me before I get hungry enough to eat you.""

‚ÄúWhat... what?! *Eat me?*‚Äù Adam stammered from the doorway, voice shaking, barely holding it together. ‚ÄúAre you a rabid dog or something?‚Äù

""No,"" North replied without looking up. ""Can't you tell? I'm already a zombie.""

""Yeah, right,"" Adam shot back, though he was clearly terrified and trying to hide it behind sarcasm. ""What kind of off-brand zombie can talk normally? You need to work on your act, dude. It's embarrassing."" He was clutching what looked like a deodorant bottle like it was some kind of weapon. ""Once I get out of here, I'm calling 911 immediately.""

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs stopping you,‚Äù North muttered. ‚ÄúDoor‚Äôs open. Go ahead. I‚Äôm sure your mom and dad are out there somewhere real worried about you.‚Äù

Adam pressed himself against the wall and started inching toward the apartment door like he was trying to avoid attracting a wild animal's attention. He took each step slowly and carefully until he reached the entrance.

North heard the click of the handle, the soft squeak of the hinges, and then Adam‚Äôs footsteps thudding down the hall as he bolted.

North sighed through his teeth and shook his head before moving on to the last of the rope. He finished tying off Marcus, checked the knots, then stood up, joints still jerking slightly from the stim current running through his system. Next was Danielle and Emma. He needed to get them tied up too before they woke.

Kids were always worse.

For some reason, zombified children were faster, more agile, like the infection kept their little bodies limber and twitchy while overriding the part of their brain that used to know mercy. And the worst part was that they still looked innocent when they lunged, wide-eyed and grayish pale, small enough to slip under tables or crawl out of vents and closets like some demon straight out of a horror movie.

He didn‚Äôt know why, but child zombies were always the ones that got people killed.

As the night rolled in, North didn‚Äôt bother trying to sleep ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt need to anymore.¬†

His body had already crossed that line, and whatever part of his brain used to trigger tiredness had long since shut off.¬†

So he just sat there on the sofa, checking the pressure mod he‚Äôd rigged onto the trigger earlier in toy guns. He was out of parts anyway, so there were no more small toys or scraps to gut and rework into something deadly. And even if he could make more gear, there was only so much he could do. As at the end of the day, he was stuck with what he could lift and move, and didn't have some magical inventory system where he could stuff unlimited gear.

What honestly surprised him more though, Adam still hadn't come back. 

He'd figured the kid would wander around the building for maybe an hour, see the chaos outside with his own eyes, then come crawling back once reality hit him. 

But apparently North had miscalculated the situation; either Adam had decided North was too dangerous to be around, or maybe some survivor group had picked him up off the street. Either way, North didn't feel particularly attached to the kid's fate. He wasn't sad or worried about what happened to some random kid. His actual concern was for Jake and the others, plus Danielle, who he‚Äôd watched grow from a noisy toddler into a bratty little teen who never quite shut up, and for all her attitude, she‚Äôd still always been family by proximity.¬†

Along with all his overflowing thoughts, he was really starting to feel hungry. His zombie body needed regular feeding to fuel whatever weird evolutionary process the fungal infection was running. Still, there was something else too. His super intuition, or whatever it was, had started to sharpen again. He could feel patterns. He could sense when something was wrong with the way circuits were built or how pressure would collapse under tension. The clarity wasn‚Äôt like it had been in the sixth loop, not yet anyway. Back then, he could look at a piece of garbage and instantly see how to weaponize it, modify it, make it dangerous. But it was definitely returning.

Besides, If he could physically manage it, he would've already gotten everyone out of the apartment by now. But dragging five unconscious people without seriously injuring them was basically impossible, especially with his current zombie strength limitations.

It had only been the second day since everything fell apart, but the streets outside were already getting quieter. 

Peering through his window, North saw the occasional person looting stores or driving around aimlessly, probably looking for supplies or other survivors.¬† At one point, a group in a beat-up pickup truck came barreling down the road, and without hesitation they veered onto the footpath with the infected caught in time. They mowed through bodies like it was a game.

‚Ä¶ . .

The third day crept in without warning.¬†

The sky was pale and soft like nothing had changed, but North had stopped trusting the sun as a sign of anything long ago, and he only noticed the day had turned when he felt a subtle tug in his hand.¬†The rope shifted slightly like someone was trying to get away, and when he turned, it was Danielle. 

She was softly growling like she was either hungry or scared out of her mind.¬†

North gently pulled her back until she was sitting on the sofa, then studied her cloudy eyes where he could see white mycelium threading through her corneas like some kind of living spiderweb. It was impossible to tell if any part of the old Danielle was still trapped inside that fungal network.

*She should still be in there somewhere. I wonder if giving her more Nuka Brain would boost their consciousness levels? Maybe I could make them more aware of what's happening. I need to find some test subjects for experiments...*

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs gonna hurt you. You‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

Danielle blinked slowly. Not much of a response, but not aggressive either. Her muscles twitched like she was caught in some kind of mental lag, like her brain was buffering between fight and freeze. North rubbed the top of her head gently, hoping that if she was trapped inside her own body, she wouldn't feel scared or alone. Unlike him, who'd built up some kind of immunity to the fungal takeover through multiple loops, his friends were still at the most basic level of zombie consciousness.

Still, he kept talking to her softly, repeating that if she could hear him, she was safe, that he was here, that nothing bad would happen.

Soon, Jake, Sarah, and Marcus also started stirring around mid-morning. Amy, David, and Emma still weren't showing any signs of movement, which was starting to worry North since he couldn't tell if they were actually dead or just taking longer to complete their transformation. The only way to know for sure would be cutting them open to see how much mycelium had spread through their internal organs, but that seemed a bit premature. For now, all North could do was wait and keep watching the situation developing outside his windows.¬†

Then by afternoon, he started hearing gunshots and people screaming from inside his own building, which meant people turned zombie had finally started to wake up. 

Down on the street, zombies had started moving in small groups and actively attacking anything alive that moved, then forming larger hordes after each kill to hunt for more survivors.¬†

He watched one group get run over by a pickup truck. Some survivors who hadn‚Äôt given up yet, smashing through the horde like it was nothing, blood and limbs flying under their tires, but the crowd didn‚Äôt thin, just kept forming, more and more like they were being pulled toward each other by instinct or signal or whatever hive-mind thing the fungus had built into them, and North knew it was only going to get worse from here.

Because the aliens hadn‚Äôt arrived yet.¬†

They usually started with dropping into areas with higher concentrations of survivors.

By the time evening came, and the sky turned that deep, reddish purple where the sun bleeds behind black smoke and broken glass, Joyce, David, and Emma still hadn‚Äôt moved. Just three bodies lying in the middle of his living room floor like they‚Äôd been discarded there.¬†

North waited a little longer, just in case, just for a sliver of hope, but eventually that faded too, and he got up without saying anything, walked to the kitchen, opened the drawer, and pulled out the knife he‚Äôd kept ready. He knelt down beside David. There was no ceremony to it and made a clean incision down his chest from neck to waist, then carefully peeled back the skin and pulled the muscle tissue aside like a zipper, until he could see the ribcage underneath. There were no mycelium threads anywhere in David's body, no fungal networks spreading through his organs like there should have been. They were just dead, plain and simple.

North leaned back on his heels and stared at him for a long minute, the knife resting in his hand, blood cooling on the blade. It hit him harder than he expected, like a reminder that even after everything, even after six loops of watching people die and cities burn, he still wasn‚Äôt numb.

He sat down on the couch without bothering to clean the blood off his hands, letting the silence settle again like dust on everything. He looked at three of them sleeping peacefully and consoled himself that they were in a better place. And, half of them were still here. Jake. Sarah. Marcus. Danielle. Four out of seven. And given how this loop had gone so far, North figured that was about as close to a win as he was going to get.

He didn‚Äôt let the sadness stay long.

Outside, the city was on fire again. Columns of smoke rose from what looked like every neighborhood in Los Angeles, staining the sky black. 

Somewhere in the distance, gunshots echoed off the buildings like popcorn cracking in metal bowls. A siren wailed and died mid-scream. The chaos was spreading faster and faster, which meant they needed to get moving before their building became a target. And night was the perfect cover.

North stood up and walked over to the coffee table where the modified toy gun sat waiting and started loading it with homemade grenades, checking each one to make sure the firing mechanism would work properly.¬†

His four zombie friends were conscious enough to walk and follow basic commands, even if they couldn't hold any conversations yet. Danielle was responsive and seemed to recognize him, which was more than he'd hoped for at this stage.

It was time to leave his apartment behind.

Never had a crush on someone before (I do consider myself asexual, look it up if you're unsure what it means!) but...I think I might now!! I'm also in a place where I feel a lot more sure of myself.

Yesterday morning I was in a furniture shop and bought, well, furniture. The guy helping me was very nice, and I thought he looked cute too! And he seemed to look at me as well in a different way than the customer he helped before me (that or I'm insane!).

I've not been able to let him go since! I keep thinking of him. We had a nice little chat. Then when I exited the store I saw him again down the hall, and I went to put my hair behind my ear as I talked to my mom, and I saw him do a sort of wave then hurriedly put it back...And he quickly averted my gaze! I realised he thought I'd waved to him. I think that looked cute lol.

Anyways, I can't stop thinking that I want to go back and, if he's there, somehow strike up convo and just...ask for a coffee or smth!

But would this be WILDLY inappropriate?! Ik it's his job to be nice to me!! But he seems so sweet, and looks cute too! And if he says no, itd hopefully make him happy to have been asked out.

I'm very prepared for a no. And worst case...I will just avoid that store for a long time lol. I barely go there anyways, but need to go back to check for a sofa again anyways. Just so so worried I'll make him uncomfortable, or if it's entirely wrong to consider actually doing this.

It was raining that evening. I was in my room, reading _Giovanni‚Äôs Room_ and drinking my coffee. I had a long hard day, and I had to study in the evening. A much needed break. The plot was thickening, the main character‚Äôs estranged girlfriend had suddenly announced that she was returning to him. My phone buzzed and broke my dream like state, brought me back to reality. It were audio messages from my ex. 

To give you a context, I started dating my ex when I was in college. We both met while volunteering, and she wanted to be a writer. I loved it, we spent hours talking about genres and scents and bookstores and prose. We became best friends, and then fell in love. Unfortunately she had to move away to a college far away from my hometown, as did I. The distance between us was massive. But to make things work, I would save up money and buy tickets to go see her thousands of miles away. I had nothing to give her except long walks and endless chatter as we strolled through city squares and beaches. I would write her poetry, sing her songs, do extra classes at the uni to secure a job for the life she wanted to build, and that life demanded support for she was the artistic one. Not that she asked me to, but because I wanted to. It was perfect, well, sort of, other than this constant gnawing feeling in my stomach. Something never felt right, as if I _needed_ to impress her all the time. She would withdraw from time to time. When you are young and idle, your energy fills in for the lack of emotions.  

She finished her college and started finding a job. Since I was studying STEM, I had a year longer. She found her job, and moved even further than before. From calling everyday we settled to calling once a month, and that too when I would dial in 3-4 times, wanting to talk, wanting to let her know what is happening to us as if she had moved away from a house on fire, but still had to come back to it. I gave up calling. I gave up texting. 

There came a time when I knew she was inevitably drinking alcohol in order to ‚Äúfind herself‚Äù. I wanted to meet her during the festive holidays but she would make some excuses. Each day my heart sank further. 

The contact was almost zero. She would open my texts and like a message from time to time. That was all I needed, all I had. I would look at that text written by me ‚ÄúI hope you are okay‚Äù and the little red heart below it paled all of my academic achievements. 

Soon enough, one of her friends told me that she has told her friends we have broken up. I called her, she did not pick my call. She texted me ‚ÄúI am busy‚Äù. No more. I told her that she did me wrong. It was in December 2023. I did not see her or call her again. 

It is 2025 now. For more than one year I was Thoreau in Walden. I was Shelley‚Äôs yearning in _Prometheus Unbound_ and Neruda‚Äôs nostalgia in _The Song of Despair_. I lived to meet with my few good friends once or twice a month. I started doing the things I loved. I left my job and started studying electronics. I got a good internship too! I love what I do (When you love what you do your heart feels like it‚Äôs spilling honey onto a pancake). 

My ex realised something, I do not know, and started DMing me on my phone from time to time since January. However, each time she would come and see that I am still alone, and relatively content, she would leave me before I could talk the talk. 

I realised this is another loop of control. I politely asked her to let me go else I would have to block her (Obviously medical emergencies are welcome, but not friendly conversations). 

Then one day a long audio note arrived. She sweared that I was her soulmate and she did not know how I kept my calm and withstood what she did to me. I did not want to escalate it, so I told her that I cannot judge her but ofc I felt hurt. However, a lot of good things came out of the breakup. 

As soon as I wanted to share more, again, she was to be found in bars and clubs. 

I wrote to her that I am not interested in her magic show, and if she were really guilty she would have respected my boundary and not whatever she was doing. 

I had a habit of self harm for the last ten years. I would blame myself more for everything wrong in my life. However more than what we can count must align to see something in its fruition. What I did for her, thankfully God, or luck, presented me with greater opportunities of service and love towards friends and strangers alike. I stopped slapping myself. I started really embracing the good in me. I will soon start my master‚Äôs now. The bigger achievement is that I stopped self harming. 

I narrated my story because so many people posting here talk about loosing trust. It is difficult. I was ghosted in a relationship where I did all I could. I was neglected and abused as a child. I do not want to platform myself, however, without being said I must say that I am quite proud of the maturity I have developed. The world will tell you that all men want is sex and all women want is money, and amongst all those people are your adversaries too! Do not listen to them!

So many of the people here have centred that instance into their present. In hating your ex you should not begin resenting all that is good about you. All that loves life and living. All that does not care about transactional bonds. 

‚ÄúA man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.‚Äù Think about it sometime.

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I‚Äôve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn‚Äôt small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn‚Äôt know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren‚Äôt thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn‚Äôt choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

Loving you has been the most real thing I‚Äôve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You showed me what unconditional love felt and looked like. You didn‚Äôt just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. I saw you and my god are you beautiful! I have never seen such Beaty, on the inside and absolutely the outside! I loved you unconditionally and without expectation, but I now see that even the deepest love can‚Äôt thrive without healing. And it wasn‚Äôt the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn‚Äôt yet faced. That‚Äôs on me and I will forever be sorry for that!

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn‚Äôt let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I‚Äôve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I‚Äôm not doing this for a second chance. I‚Äôm doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way and I wanted to love you the right way! And because all I want, is for you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first woman I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a ‚Äúforever sounds good‚Äù kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you allow me the honor? That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn‚Äôt end at death. It doesn‚Äôt even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, I will hold it like we both know it deserves to be held!  With kindness, softness, with certainty and with love! You will never hear my voice raised in anger, ever. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and so much more! With all seven of our children! With all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. To me, this is the perfect love. A perfect love, we both deserve! I want our love, unconditional love from both sides! I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the hold you as you fall asleep, the forgiveness when we‚Äôre tired, the honesty when we‚Äôre scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone in this life.

This is not just my truth. This is me and you and it‚Äôs our truth. This is a chance to start new, with the communication we both desire and the love we both want. For you. God, for us. To what I know is the greatest love story ever told not because it‚Äôs flawless, but because it is absolutely real. And real love? It deserves to be fought for, it deserves to never be given up on, so it can rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second or third chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready to be loved!

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I‚Äôm here. I am already home. All that‚Äôs missing is you, my true love.

Forever and Always

However if nothing worked/your headphones are dead the best option is to[ remove the headphone covers](https://youtu.be/sJbu9pjAKMo?si=UEfWtReSp8DtKspm), then disconnect and reconnect the battery jack. The battery jack is inside the left earphone cup (you can see the white box near the battery in the video) and should be easy to unplug and replug. 

Afterwards I just charged it till the red-light went off and then slipped the covers back on, now the battery seems to be working normally but I will update if issues persist.

First night in Germany, ferry across the Elbe. Ferry from Amsterdam -> Newcastle and then up through Northumbria, into Cairngorms, roughly following the NC500, onto Isle of Skye, down to Lake District, straight line through Wales and then across to Harwich for a ferry to Hoek van Holland, then a huge day home (870km).

Weather:  
Virtually no rain for the first half of the trip, some severe rain from Isle of Skye down to Lake District and then dry and hot.

  
Mishaps:   
Leaving Isle of Skye my Beeline Moto 2 died from water exposure (it got VERY wet leaving the island heh). They will replace it on warranty, annoying but I really like the device.  
   
Dropped the bike once on the west coast of Scotland in a hairpin after a local came the other way at high speed and I leaned into the curve instead of out when stopping. Which bent the brake lever but no other damage.  
  
Saw a R1300GS get blown of the road by 25-30m/s wind gusts, rider to the hospital via helicopter and passenger completely fine.

  
  
All in all 14 days, 400km a day average, too much money on hotels/pubstays/b&bs, scones, coffee and Guiness/Whisky.

  
Google Maps navigation by voice only is pretty bad.   
Beeline maps voice navigation (since the device died) is much better but the app is \_ASS\_ when you don't have the device. It will not re-route if you go off path without stopping and opening the app. The app in general is just annoying to use if you like to plan as you go like me. You can't add waypoints to a route once you have started.",100,1751830529.0,motorcycles,4,0.99,False

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I‚Äôve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn‚Äôt small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn‚Äôt know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren‚Äôt thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn‚Äôt choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

1lt9uce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1lt9uce/calling_on_those_who_have_recovered_or_made/,Calling on those who have recovered or made progress. I am stuck and seeking advice.,"I've had agoraphobia for 4 years now. It wasn't all just bad. Around two years ago, I started working my way up to going out to eat. I went to dinner a few times, and then from there started going around town. I was able to go to different restaurants, get coffee, go in shops, friends houses, and even in person therapy. It wasn't perfect, I needed a safety person to drop me off at those locations as I couldn't drive myself but, it was better than staying in. 

My father was a big safety person for me, and he died in early 2024. It was a really horrible and traumatic time for me. A few months later my anxiety going out was just getting worse and not only was I having trouble coping with it, but so many people in my family were putting pressure on me needing to get better since I was now that ""man of the house"". It got too much, going out to eat was now harder, and going to in person therapy was too much. I stopped going out and, now I've been stuck for about a year. 

I just feel so hopeless sometimes and exhausted from everything that has happened in my life. After all that work I put into this, the world kicked me down again and I'm back to not being able to leave my house again? I don't wanna give up though but, it seems so much more terrifying now. I will try to do driving exposures a few times a week by myself just around my neighborhood and for the last year, I've seen no progress. If anything, I feel like the exposures are making me more nervous and I've regressed. I can't even drive a minute down my street without feeling panic. And yet, my therapist who is now online told me last week if I don't push myself beyond my neighborhood again, he doesn't see how I will ever get better. 

Here is where I am seeking advice the most. It sucks to have heard that but, maybe he's right? Two years ago when I started going out again, my first exposures were not trying to drive myself around the neighborhood, it was going out to eat with my parents. A tiny bit further sure but, being with a safety person made it easier and there was a reward to it. I got a nice meal, and had a fun time socializing with whoever I was with. Is it possible these driving exposures I am doing are not effective because there is no reward? 

And lastly, as I've mentioned I have been doing these driving exposures alone because I want to be able to function and go places on my own. I do not want to rely on a safety person again. But, as I've mentioned no progress is being made so, should I get a safety person and like try going out to eat again? Is it okay to have a safety person? Cause I'm told we should avoid safety behaviors when doing exposures but, I also feel like going further around town with a safety person like I used to was better than whatever I'm doing now.

1lt9uc3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lt9uc3,My FP journey so far,"Although I've added the ""Handwriting"" flair, I'd like to state - for the record - that I'm not at all satisfied with my handwriting still. I know, I know - sounds like a cop-out. 

However, I've come a long way since school, when my scribbles were deemed truly illegible. And now, I'd like to present my cursive writing. 

With that stated, here's my long fountain pen journey in short. 

Now I turn 28 in two months. And as an adult, I've built a bit of a modest collection of five fountain pens. All of which have helped me further my penmanship. I try to write about four pages a day; a bit more progress is made over the weekends. 

The focus of this post is, of course, my Pilot Custom 74 (M). Hence, I'll write a brief note about it. 

So, I prefer Medium nibs somehow, much to the chagrin of my dad, who gifted this lovely writer to me. However, as Matt Armstrong likes to say - and I paraphrase - not all pens I received were great, but I made them great. And a common problem with Pilot No. 5 nibs is that the tines are too tight. 

Although, it wrote perfectly out of the box. One fine day, the box - with the pen inside - fell from a foot or two, and it developed skipping issues. So, I had to make some adjustments to this nib (I know, nails on a chalkboard). Safe to say, it writes splendidly now. If anyone needs any DIY tips to fix the infamous ""tines too tight"" problem on their pen, I'd be happy to help. 

That said, don't do what I did. Send it to Pilot instead. Sadly, I'm an impatient bugger.

Anyway, here are the rest of the pens and ink pots in the subsequent frames (with an indulgent one-liner for each.)

\#1 Caran d'Ache Madison - It is a pen from the '70s that was passed down to me after my maternal grandmother's passing. It is a broad nib and a bit leaky, but it writes like glass.

\#2 Sheaffer Sagaris - This is the first pen I bought with my own meagre income of Rs 4000 per month. At the time, it was much cheaper. That said, this pen is totally slept on. It is a smooth and reliable writer - one of my favourites. Again, a Medium nib. 

\#3 TWSBI Eco - This pen grew on me, actually. Only recently did I realise that it is such a fine writer (pun intended) 'cause this pen is a Fine nib. Sorry folks. 

\#4 Another Sheaffer, and this one is a Gift 100 - It was an impulse purchase that was months in the making. I always was enchanted by the coffee brown tone. One fine day, I just walked into the store and took it home. Now, this pen is a decent writer, but Sheaffer has to really fine-tune some of their nibs. I tried looking under my phone camera's lens and noticed the tines were slightly off. That said, it is pleasant to look at and has a nice heft to it. 

Now for the ink pots. I'll just list them from left to right.

J. Herbin √âclat de Saphir, Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-peki (damn it, Goulet!), Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo, and lastly, Robert Oster Verde de Rio (I wish I had known the stories of this guy before I bought this one.) Other than that, Dad has borrowed my nearly-empty bottle of Diamine Oxblood. Someday, I'll include it in an FP reunion. 

Personally, the Iroshizuku bottles are unparalleled. Also, the notebook I'm using is - you guessed it - the Midori MD. On a final note, this is my fourth Midori notebook so far, and I've reserved it for copying the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters. ",7,1751830331.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

I am a 31m and I met a 31f on Tinder. We had some great conversation and had a nice first date - with a kiss. We talked an laughted.
I wanted to take her home, I asked if she would like a drink at my place - but my room in not clean. So I said we should do that next time. A HUGE fail from my side. Pretty stressful week for me so I could not clean. We kissed when we left and touched each other.

Second date was a bit boring - she felt a bit distracted and we did not talk that much. We were chilling at the river We did not kiss this time. I touched her a bit but nothing came back from her.

Today was the 3. Date and we went by bicycle for about 2 hours and had a coffee. She felt  cold and again distracted we did not talk that much again. Also, the date did not end at her or my place - I did not want to ask because I did not want to make me look needy to ask her to come and we had bicycle clothing on. Also, we did not kiss again this time - also she said, she‚Äôs going to cook asparagus today. Also, she said next week she is very busy with friends. I was pretty disappointed and angry that I failed so hard on the dates.

I think its over - she wrote me every time that she like it but today she just wrote that she arrived home with her bike. And then did not write anymore.

Playing an instrument, speaking a new language, driving, swimming, riding a bike, writing, mastering a dance routine, tying your shoes, reading, solving simple math equations in your head, making coffee, typing on a keyboard, etc. These are all things that we do effortlessly without thinking, meaning they're programmed into our psyche. Are any of these skills developed through any of the techniques promoted in the manifestation community? Absolutely not. They're developed through repeated action and practice until you master them enough to do them without thinking.

Can you imagine if instead of teaching children how to read and write, we told them to just visualize and affirm ""I'm a master reader and writer""? Can you imagine your piano teacher telling you to affirm and visualize yourself playing piano instead of actually teaching you how to play the piano? Can you imagine if your Spanish teacher just told you to affirm and visualize that you're fluent in Spanish and to listen to Spanish music before bed rather than actually teaching you the language? You would think these teachers were absolutely insane and want them to lose their jobs. Why can't you realize that this is exactly what loa/life/spiritual coaches are doing when they don't give you any real advice on improving your life, and just tell you that all you have to do is ""live in the end"", ""get in alignment"", and change your mindset to get whatever you want?

These are the real life equivalents of ""You don't have to lift a finger"", ""Don't mess with the 3D"", ""Don't worry about the how"", ""The bride of incidents will come on its own"", ""Inspired action will just appear"", and all the other nonsense they say to make you feel comfortable. Because who doesn't want to believe that you can build the exact life you want without having to do anything you don't feel like doing? If this were true, there would be no point in doing anything but lying in your bed all day, doing manifestation techniques.

1lt9gxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovidWarriors/comments/1lt9gxr/lets_talk_about_fibromyalgia/,Let's talk about Fibromyalgia.,"Fibromyalgia was the first diagnosis that I received exactly six months after my COVID infection. Here's the first post I wrote on reddit: Here's Everything I've learned about Fibromyalgia.

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in December 2023. There are 200+ symptoms and comorbidities of Fibromyalgia varying both in number and intensity from person to person. I'll share with you what I know. It's believed that Fibromyalgia is neurological in nature, caused by problems with the nervous system. Research suggests that brain chemicals like serotonin and norepinephrine may be out of balance, which could change how people react to painful stimuli. Antidepressants used for Fibromyalgia and comorbid conditions fall under four categories. There are SNRIs, SSRIs, TCAs, and Atypicals.

SNRIs can be effective for treating Fibromyalgia pain. SNRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin and other ""feel good"" chemicals available to the brain, which can help relieve pain, anxiety, and depression. SNRIs include Duloxetine, Milnacipran, Venlafaxine, and Desvenlafaxine.  

SSRIs can be used to treat Fibromyalgia symptoms, such as emotional symptoms and pain. SSRIs include Citalopram, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine and Sertraline. SSRIs can be used as adjunct therapy to manage Fibromyalgia pain, and this effect is independent of their antidepressant activity. SSRIs are generally less effective than TCAs for pain, but they often have fewer side effects.
                                                 
TCAs are more effective than SSRIs and SNRIs for reducing pain. TCAs are often used off-label for Fibromyalgia. TCAs include: Amitriptyline, Desipramine,  Imipramine and Nortriptyline. Atypicals include Aripiprazole, Bupropion, Mirtazapine, and Trazodone. These medications may be especially helpful for Fibromyalgia and can help with symptoms like low energy and sleeplessness. Fibromyalgia patients often respond well to lower doses than those used to treat depression, and it can take 3‚Äì4 weeks for symptoms to improve. In some cases, it can take up to 6-8 weeks.

There are other medications that can help with symptom management as well. There's Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Gabapentin both nerve pain medications. There's Cyclobenzaprine and Tizanidine, both muscle relaxers.There's low dose nalotrexone (LDN), which can be prescribed for brain fog, fatigue and pain. Opiods aren't first-line medications for Fibromyalgia. But they can be prescribed if other medications have failed, for breakthrough pain, or if there are other comorbid conditions. Opiods include Hydrocodone, low dose Morphine, Methadone, Oxycodone, and Tramadol. This list isn't inclusive of every opiod medication that's prescribed.

Your doctor may prescribe medications off-label to treat Fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe a combination of medications. I'd suggest talking to your doctor about symptom management. For example, if you're having depression, pain, and sleep issues, there may be two medications prescribed at different dosages that work together to manage those symptoms. This list gives you possible options to discuss with your doctor. Based on where you live in the world, some medications may not be available or used in your country. You should do your own research, reviewing both the benefits and side effects of each medication.

OTC medications Ibuprofen and tylenol can be helpful as well. Lidocaine or SalonPas are pain relieving patches. There are topical pain relieving creams like BlueEmu or Voltaren cream. Magnesium cream or spray can help with muscle cramps. Epsom salt baths are helpful. 

Supplements including a good multivitamin, Qunol Ultra COq10 100-200mg (muscle aches & sleep) vitamin D, fish oil, L-tryptophan, L-theanine,
Magnesium glycinate (for muscle cramps) and/or Magnesium taurate (for sleep), Melatonin, Ribose, Sam-e, Taurine, and Tumeric are beneficial. Some people prefer Magnesium that blends several types into one formula for a combined benefit that provides a greater reduction in overall symptoms. Magnesiu-OM and Vitalitown are two brands that do this.

Other non-medical options include large heating pads, specifically infrared ones, home acupuncture aides, and massage guns are beneficial for muscle pain and tightness. Body pillows and weighted blankets are great while resting in bed or sleeping. 

There are books. The Fibro Manual by Ginevra Liptan is an excellent resource. It's written by a doctor who also has Fibromyalgia. Take Back your Life: Find Hope and Freedom from Fibromyalgia Symptoms and Pain by Tami Stackelhouse is an excellent book with real-life strategies. I really like it. I purchased both books from Amazon.

An anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce the bodys' sensitivity to pain. Evidence points to inflammation playing a part in Fibromyalgia, though it is usually not considered an inflammatory condition. The Mediterranean Diet is also highly recommended for Fibromyalgia. There are anti-inflammatory cookbooks as well as those for Fibromyalgia. Research says carbohydrates are bad, dairy is bad, red meat is bad, sugar is bad, alcohol is bad, and caffeine is bad. I personally don't think it's necessarily true. I started with an anti-inflammation diet. I switched to a low-histamine diet when I was diagnosed with MCAS. We all have different triggers to drinks and the foods we ingest.

What's most important is that you listen to your body. After I was diagnosed, I started an anti-inflammation diet. I added Premier Protein shakes with 30 grams of protein. And fruit cups or applesauce without added sugar into my diet. That way, I get protein and natural carbohydrates/sugar into my diet. Smaller snack sized meals work better for me. I later added potato bowls or rice bowls with a little butter, shredded cheese, vegetables, and ground beef or chicken breast. I added low-fat cottage cheese with fruit, yogurt, and specialty bread that I can tolerate. I dip it in red wine vinegar with extra virgin olive oil for healthy fat. Stay hydrated. Add electrolytes if needed. I stopped drinking alcohol, caffeine, coffee, and soda. I added some iced coffee back into my diet a couple of months ago. I also added some treats back into my diet as tolerable. I love chocolate cake, cheesecake, and other treats. I just don't eat anywhere near the quantity of junk food that I used to eat.

It's worth mentioning that Fibromyalgia is associated with dysautonomia, particularly orthostatic intolerance. Research suggests that autonomic dysfunction may contribute to Fibromyalgia symptoms. Fibromyalgia patients may have hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system while resting and hypoactivity during stressors like exercise, cold exposure, or standing. These autonomic changes can become apparent when moving from a supine to upright position and can cause dizziness, palpitations, or even syncope. Head-up tilt table testing can help evaluate autonomic dysfunction in Fibromyalgia patients and can be useful for treating complaints like fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations. If you have any of these symptoms, I'd suggest talking to your doctor about dysautonomia.

It's also worth mentioning hypothyroidism, and Fibromyalgia are both common conditions that often occur together, and their symptoms can be similar. Up to 40% of people with hypothyroidism may also have Fibromyalgia, and Fibromyalgia is especially common in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It's an autoimmune disease that causes hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism and Fibromyalgia that overlap include: fatigue, depression, and muscle or joint pain. If you're concerned about thyroid issues, ask your doctor to run a complete thyroid panel.

Finally,  ME/CFS is actually the most common comorbidity found in people with Fibromyalgia, affecting around 77% of patients. This significant overlap suggests a strong link between the two conditions and may help explain shared symptoms like debilitating fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ‚Äì Evidence for an autoimmune disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997218300880?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

I do all my research online. Many doctors are not helpful unless you're lucky enough to have a good one. I have a great doctor. He's not a Fibromyalgia specialist. We have a collaborative relationship. You have to do your own research. Bring your A game to every appointment or phone call. You have to become your own health advocate.

Here's how I found out what caused my symptoms:
[Various medical conditions that mimic anxiety and my experience with Dysautonomia and MCAS](https://www.reddit.com/u/SophiaShay7/s/beloRT9kKc)

Here's how I manage them: [My diagnoses and how I found a regimen that helps me manage them](https://www.reddit.com/u/SophiaShay7/s/2TpKhJVeys)

I've always believed ME/CFS was my dominant diagnosis. Nope, it's MCAS. ME/CFS with Dysautonomia is a close second. My level of functioning increased significantly once my MCAS was better managed and more stable. My Fibromyalgia pain was severe last year. Now, it's at nearly zero. So much so that I told my ME/CFS specialist that I don't believe I have Fibromyalgia anymore. He assured me that I do. Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS are often believed to be the same disease at two different points on the spectrum that are caused by varying degrees of autonomic dysfunction.

I do want to clarify it's been a combination of a low histamine diet, adding foods back in as tolerable, medications, vitamins, supplements, avoiding triggers, pacing and avoiding PEM, lots of rest and good sleep hygiene that's created a synergistic effect. I've also lost 65 pounds. 

I take Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms and Diazepam for MCAS flares and severe PEM caused by ME/CFS. Astelin, Clarinex, and Montelukast for MCAS. Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). Tirosint for hypothyroidism. For vitamins and supplements, I take vitamin D3 and K2 drops, Electrolyte tablets, GABA, L-theanine, liposomal PEA and Luteolin, NatureBell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex. And sometimes Magnesiu-OM powder (3 types of chelated magnesium and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan). 

My regimen: [My medications, vitamins, and supplement regimen and how they manage my symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/u/SophiaShay7/s/77RmK48SYa)

I was diagnosed with ME/CFS with dysautonomia, Hashimoto's, and MCAS in 2024. My ME/CFS is severe, and I've been bedridden for 19 months. I didn't see any improvements until month 14. I went from 95% bedridden for 17 months to 75% bedridden. Depending on my comorbidities, MCAS flares, and PEM from ME/CFS, my symptoms fluctuate. However, I truly believe I've found a regimen that manages my symptoms. 

Create a regimen that works for you. Hugsüíú

edit: I'm not saying Fibromyalgia is all in your head. Fibromyalgia is a very real diagnosis that causes physiological symptoms. Unfortunately, options for medications that manage Fibromyalgia are very limited.

I have taken Amitriptyline 25mg (TCA), Cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxer), Duloxetine (SSRI), Gabapentin (Gabapentinoid), Ibuprofen (NSAID), Milnacipran (SNRI), and Nabumetone (NSAID). Nothing I tried worked at all and made my symptoms worse. If you have Dysautonomia, especially POTS and/or MCAS, these medications will likely worsen your symptoms.

Hoping to score 2 balcony rooms near each other- going for my MIL's milestone birthday.    
I've never done Virgin , the last cruise we did was NCL to Italy/Spain.  
Curious if there's anything we should do before we book with our travel agent.  

  
Deck: is there anything you'd recommend for which Deck to aim for? We probably want something midship and on the quieter side.  We are in our 40s, MIL is 75.

  
Weather:  I know it's the end of Hurricane season- I know there's a small risk with these dates- anyone travel during this time down there and have feedback/suggestions.  The price for the cruise is really great- and it may be because of hurricane risk.

Drink packages (bar tabs?) is it necessary, or ideal to do so?  My MIL will have 1-2 drinks a day.  We probably would do about 3-4 a day.  I'm not a specialty coffee drinker.  For me it's water or wine.  Unless low cal seltzers or THC drinks are an option (Which I'm guessing is not a thing yet on cruises lol)

Excursions is it best to book through Virgin or are there external companies? Honestly for it being all Caribbean I don't know what excursions would even work (or be worth it), we likely just want one beach day, I doubt my MIL will want to do a catamaran (coming from a bigger boat she's not going to see the point.

1lt9cns,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Critiform/comments/1lt9cns/wireless_isnt_the_futureits_a_convenience_cables/,Wireless Isn‚Äôt the Future‚ÄîIt‚Äôs a Convenience. Cables Are the Backbone,"Introduction

There‚Äôs a dangerous trend in the tech world: the systematic removal of wired connections in favor of sleek, wireless-only designs. Whether it‚Äôs phones, laptops, or even desktop hardware, manufacturers‚Äîespecially Apple‚Äîare on a mission to strip away physical ports in the name of ‚Äúinnovation.‚Äù But this isn‚Äôt progress. It‚Äôs control. And it‚Äôs happening at the expense of speed, privacy, reliability, and user freedom. Worse still, it‚Äôs locking users into ecosystems where every ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù comes with a catch‚Äîand a price tag.

Body

Cables aren‚Äôt a problem. They‚Äôre a solution. Wired connections offer faster charging, faster file transfers, and guaranteed stability. A USB cable doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre in a crowded coffee shop, a remote cabin, or a busy airport‚Äîit just works. Yet somehow, modern devices are ditching these essential tools. Apple‚Äôs latest laptops give you maybe two USB-C ports‚Äîif that‚Äîand then expect you to shell out for a hub just to plug in basic peripherals. Now they‚Äôre floating the idea of a completely wireless iPhone, with no port at all. That‚Äôs not forward-thinking‚Äîit‚Äôs user-hostile.

To add insult to injury, USB ports are how we connect external drives, which are essential for things like video editing, backups, or even simple file transfers. But Apple doesn‚Äôt want you doing that. They‚Äôd rather you pay for cloud storage‚Äîwhere they control access, throttle your bandwidth, and charge you forever. Their devices still ship with 128GB, 256GB, or if you‚Äôre lucky, 512GB of storage‚Äîas if it‚Äôs still 2012 and people aren‚Äôt shooting 4K video or handling large project files. Want 1TB? Prepare to pay a massive premium. Meanwhile, cloud storage gets pushed as the solution‚Äîconvenient, sure, but built on limiting local options so they can push a subscription.

Let‚Äôs not forget that wireless is often less secure and less reliable. It‚Äôs prone to interference, can be jammed or throttled, and in many cases‚Äîlike transferring large files‚Äîit‚Äôs simply slower. And if anything goes wrong with the wireless systems, guess what you‚Äôll wish you had? A cable.

Wired connections are also about redundancy. They‚Äôre the fallback when wireless fails. They‚Äôre the recovery tool, the hardline path, the direct interface that doesn‚Äôt rely on paired devices or cloud permissions. It‚Äôs the same reason Teslas still need a mechanical door release. Some things just need to work, no matter what.

Now I used to exclusively use Apple products. When purchasing one for my wife who still uses them. The sale person asked me. Why don‚Äôt you use Apple anymore. When I sited the storage issues and push for cloud he stated. ‚ÄúWell Apple studies how users use their products and people just don‚Äôt use them for that.‚Äù Too which I called this out. ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt use it because to do so comes at a premium. Maybe the extra ports aren‚Äôt used until one breaks. But that‚Äôs what we can get or had. Additionally I said the CEO of AMD said. People don‚Äôt use the GPUs to game in 4k they use it in 1080p.

This is where industry leaders have just gone deaf. The day a 4k monitor comes out that displays that resolution at 300hz plus. I can guarantee you. They will use it. Right now, they‚Äôre waiting for display technology to catch up to cards. 

So Apple, Microsoft, and any tech giant in this game. Time for more ports, more hard drive space and stoping obsoleting technology so you can make your users reliant on subscriptions that don‚Äôt need to be there. Because as these options have declined the push for a monthly service has only increased. Often offering less value than what we had before. 

Conclusion

What we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt the natural evolution of technology‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully crafted effort to reduce options, lock users in, and monetize convenience. Wireless tech has its place, but removing cables and ports removes choice. USB ports, headphone jacks, and data cables should always be present. They offer freedom, speed, and a way to cut through the noise‚Äîliterally and figuratively.

If you build tech, listen up: we need wires. We need ports. We need options. And we don‚Äôt need another overpriced, underpowered machine that‚Äôs useless the second your Wi-Fi drops or your cloud bill goes unpaid. Give us tools‚Äînot tethers.",1,1751829112.0,u_Critiform,0,1.0,False

With prolonged use of AI, you eventually start to mimic the prose or change the way you speak to better input prompts. 
Unfortunately, you will subconsciously try to prompt people when you have to interact with them IRL.

You‚Äôll notice how your phrasing changes with people, how silence feels heavier after every unacknowledged response.

He has 30 minutes of commute by car and I‚Äôve 1h commute despite taking the highway. 

It was my 3rd day at my new workplace and I left at 6:45 am to reach work by atleast 8 am since I had a meeting at 9 am, for which I wanted to prepare. Also to avoid traffic. I got a call from my partner at around 7:45 am saying he couldn‚Äôt find his set of keys. Then I realized that I‚Äôd left home with both sets of house keys by mistake. He was pissed off and he kept asking me to come back home to drop it off. 

I apologized but I said I can‚Äôt drive all the way back and forth. There‚Äôs no way I would reach work before 9:30 am. So I asked him to take a wfh day. We both prefer working on-site and we rarely do it unless in case of emergencies. Well, this was one such exception. He was pissed off and dropped the call. I called him again and he said he‚Äôll stay home for the day. 

Upon reaching work, I sent more apology texts and he didn‚Äôt reply. So I gave him his space for the rest of the day. When I returned home, I said sorry again and that it was an honest mistake. I even offered to pay for dinner takeout, which he accepted. But then he kept on making snide remarks as if I‚Äôm some kind of monster. 

I‚Äôm very particular about stuff at home. I don‚Äôt like things strewn all over. As long as he‚Äôs his laptop and TV, nothing bothers him. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years and I‚Äôve told him a thousand times about things that bother me. For example, he would leave coffee mugs all over the house and the only way it would make its way to the dishwasher is when we don‚Äôt have anymore mugs, he would put his laundry on top of the basket rather than open the lid and put it inside, etc. I don‚Äôt understand the fucking logic here and so yeah, I get worked up when I see that he doesn‚Äôt bother. Sometimes I make him put things back where they belongs. I agree, I can be very difficult when it comes to certain things. 

As per his logic, it was reasonable of him to ask me to drive back and forth for 90 minutes because I make him put mugs in dishwasher and clothes inside laundry basket. He insists that if it were him who‚Äôd left with my keys, I would have made him come back all the way to drop the keys. All this despite me saying that, I would‚Äôve declared wfh if that were the case. 

I‚Äôm no saint, but I‚Äôm also no cruella. I like things a certain way in my home. I feel he‚Äôs holding back some kind of contempt, because this is not the first time he‚Äôs made similar remarks. 

I‚Äôm not angry, but I‚Äôm disappointed. That this is how he feels about me. I‚Äôve not spoken to him since he made said those things. I would rather be alone than be misunderstood. I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs even worth holding on to this relationship.

1lt93vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lt93vm/i_taught_my_wife_how_to_die/,I Taught my Wife how to Die,"I Taught my Wife how to Die

By the time I got done writing that night, I was too tired to care that my wife, Symone, wasn‚Äôt home. I figured she‚Äôd gone for a walk or something.

When I woke up in the morning and saw that she wasn‚Äôt in bed, my first thought was that she‚Äôd gotten up before me and went to the store. It wasn‚Äôt until the evening that I realized she‚Äôd left me a voicemail in the middle of the night.

It was a short message, less than ten seconds. But when I think about it now I think that most of the worst things that ever happen to you happen in ten seconds or less. Probably most of the good things too. Ten seconds is enough time for a lot to happen.

I know it took me less than ten seconds to fall in love when I saw Symone for the first time. Sitting by herself in the corner of the coffee shop I worked at, reading of all things. Beautiful jet black hair, a soft face, and round glasses.

Like any straight college aged guy, it was normal for me to give some glances to pretty girls that walked in while I was working. But normally that‚Äôs all it was, a quick glance then back to work. I never thought that I would be so unprofessional as to flirt with a customer, but for the first and only time in my three years working at the coffee shop, I walked over to this beautiful girl and introduced myself.

We hit it off immediately. We talked about books, our hatred for annoying old people (we both worked in customer service), and found out that we were going to the same college, were both English majors, and we even had some of the same professors.

Months later, she told me that the moment she realized she was going to give me ‚Äúat least one date‚Äù was when I told her how lucky I felt to have a professor as knowledgeable and passionate as Dr. Ridge.

You see, Dr. Ridge was perhaps the most made-fun-of professor in the history of education. During the first day in every one of her classes, Dr. Ridge would show a short PowerPoint presentation over her 17 bunnies, each with names like Dante, Raven, and Beowulf. That wasn‚Äôt the embarrassing part‚Äîthe embarrassing part was that she had a FaceBook made for each one of her bunnies, and they all interacted with each other. Some of them were married and would post about their relationship struggles, only to argue online; some of them were dealing with injuries or illnesses and posted poems about their pain.

As you can guess, this did not go over well in freshman level classes. However, to hear Symone tell it, the fact that I looked past Dr. Ridge‚Äôs quirks to see how intelligent and kind she was, proved that I was worth a shot.

Fast forward to the day of our two year anniversary. I‚Äôm starting my last semester of college and Symone is only a few months behind me. We were at the nicest restaurant I could afford, talking about our future together for the thousandth time: we planned to get married shortly after she graduated and then move somewhere far away from either of our families. I was going to teach high school English while working on my novels, and she was going to pursue her PhD and eventually become a literature professor.

We finished dinner in high spirits and decided to go for a walk around the city. The ground was covered in snow and ice and the street lights reflected off the ground; the way that Symone lit up made her look like an angel. She was the center of the world.

We went through a local bookstore. My best friend Tommy was the clerk and gave me an employee discount on the book of Robert Frost poems I bought for Symone. When we were checking out, an old woman in line told us that we were about the cutest couple she‚Äôd ever seen.

‚ÄúYou look just like my husband and I did,‚Äù she said, then looked at me directly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever let her go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I promised.

Drunk in love, we meandered through the city until we wound up at the underground subway station. In twenty minutes there was a train going to a place in the city we‚Äôd never been through before, so we decided, screw it. We‚Äôd go check it out for no other reason other than to say that we‚Äôd experienced all the city had to offer.

We spent our downtime sitting on a bench and playing sticks with our fingers (if you don‚Äôt know how to play, Google it). Symone was always a much quicker thinker than me. She was better at chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, anything that took brain power. She had just beaten me for the fifth game in a row when I noticed the group of guys on the other side of the tracks.

They were huddled together, but when I looked up they all had their heads turned, staring directly at us. They noticed me and turned back to each other. I figured they were just some funny guys making jokes about us sitting all lovey dovey on the bench. Maybe they were checking Symone out.

Either way, they were on the other side of the tracks. They were the furthest thing from a threat at the time. That‚Äôs why I felt fine excusing myself to the bathroom a few minutes later.

As I was washing my hands, I heard a scream and instantly recognized it as Symone‚Äôs voice. I sprinted out and found her circled by all three men. The tallest one held Symone in a headlock so tight that he was lifting her off the ground. The other two were looking around for witnesses.

When they saw me they barreled toward me. Symone let out a muffled cry.

For a second time slowed. I remember thinking to myself how incredible of a situation this was. Surely this would all just stop somehow, right? This type of thing didn‚Äôt just happen.

But it was happening, and the two men were only a few feet away from me. I had no chance in a fight. Even if it was just one of them, they were nearly twice my size. The one thing that I thought I might have over them, was speed.

Like a wide receiver juking a defender, I feigned as if I was going to run away. Instead, I cut back and ran towards the gap between the leftmost man and the tracks, narrowly escaping a five-foot fall to the bottom. He reached for me, but I lowered my shoulder and barreled through his outstretched arm. I cut to the right and slammed into Symone and her assailant at full speed, bringing all three of us crashing to the ground.

I ended up on top of the tall man and elbowed him in the ribs. As I rolled away, I heard a loud thud and a shriek. One of the other men had tried to grab Symone, but had instead pushed her into the tracks about six feet below us.

I tried to stand, but then the man grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me so that I fell on my stomach and cracked my jaw so hard that I saw stars.

I kicked my feet blindly and connected with his stomach. I got free and halfway to my feet before I was grabbed and put into a headlock.

The grip was so tight I was scared my throat was going to collapse. I flailed about and clawed at hands I couldn‚Äôt see, but as deep as my nails went, the grip never loosened‚Äîuntil we heard the horn.

The train was coming.

Symone‚Äôs on the tracks.

I was thrown to the ground and a heavy boot stomped on my back and knocked the wind out of me. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the fuck out of here,‚Äù one of them yelled. By the time I could stand they were running away.

Symone frantically clawed at the wall, trying to get up out of the trench, but she was a short girl, barely five feet tall. Although she could reach up to the platform above her, the edge was curved, making it too difficult for her to get a firm hold.

I reached my arms down and tried to pull her up myself, but I just didn‚Äôt have the strength. Maybe if we had a little more time we could have worked together, but the train sounded so close. It was going to burst through the tunnel any second.

Once we saw the train, there wouldn‚Äôt be enough time to react. There wasn‚Äôt enough room down there for her to escape its girth.

I allowed myself half a second to close my eyes and think and think and think. I pictured the train bursting through the tunnel and Symone screaming my name, standing against the edge of the tracks as it ran into and through her. I thought about the sound of her bones being crushed, about never seeing her again, about spending the rest of my life without her.

I could try again to grab her, but the result would simply be the same: her getting crushed while we held hands.

There was no getting her up in time. There was only one scenario where I saw her surviving:

‚ÄúGo to the middle of the tracks and lay down,‚Äù I said.

Without hesitation, she let go of my hands, ran to the tracks, and laid down flat on her stomach with her arms firm against her sides.

Just then, the train emerged from the tunnel. Her right arm was resting exactly where the wheels of the train would run.

‚ÄúA little left!‚Äù I screamed.

She squirmed a half inch to the left just as she disappeared underneath the train.

She screamed so loudly that I could hear her over the rumbling. She screamed and screamed until the train came to a complete stop. For a long second I heard nothing except for the train doors opening and passengers holding their conversations that strung together like a bad choir.

‚ÄúSymone!‚Äù I screamed

I flagged down the operator, and he kept the train stationary until Symone was able to squeeze out. Together, we lifted her up to safety.

I called the police and told them what happened, but none of the men were ever caught. I found that to be irrelevant. Symone was safe.

For the next week, she stayed with me at my apartment. She cried in her sleep almost every night, but eventually she felt close to normal‚Äîonly, much less likely to take a late night subway train.

A couple weeks later, we were lying in bed and I was the one crying.

‚ÄúI was so scared you were going to die,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stand to live without you, and I know that it was my fault. I should never have left you alone.‚Äù

She kissed a tear running down my cheek and hugged me close. ‚ÄúBut you knew just what to do. You saved me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to do. I just said the first thing I thought of. I had no idea if the train was going to crush you or not, I just knew I couldn‚Äôt get you out in time. I had to try something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it worked.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy were you so confident in me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHow come when I told you to lay down, you just did it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my boyfriend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always there when I need you; you always do the right thing. I knew you wouldn‚Äôt let anything happen to me.‚Äù

Years later, we had a beautiful wedding at the very same church Symone was baptized in as a baby. I sobbed as she walked down the aisle; we both sobbed as we said our vows; by the time we kissed, our faces were so wet that they slid against each other like two blubbery fish.

We honeymooned in Greece where we climbed the Acropolis. We held hands as we watched the sunset. I promised  myself that, no matter what, Symone would be the important thing in my life. We were both on the precipice, about to free fall into the things we‚Äôd been dreaming about since we were young, and yet, I knew that whether I sold a million books or zero, I was going to love Symone more than anything. She would always be my priority.

Symone got accepted into one of the top English Literature PhD programs in the country, so we ended up moving to an even bigger city. She focused on her classes and worked as a waitress on the weekends. I found a teaching job at a local high school and spent my evenings working on my novels.

It was about a year into this new life when I began to find success. It started small. A publisher picked up my first book, a horror novel, and we were able to get it published in a short time with minimal edits.

A couple dozen people picked up the book, and I got some solid reviews. Every week a few more sales would roll in, and after some months it looked like I might even break even. Then some girl on TikTok made a video with a title like, ‚ÄúThe most disturbing book of 2025.‚Äù She gave a quick, spoiler free summary of my book with lots of gasps and comments like ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe what happens next.‚Äù At the end she said that she didn‚Äôt sleep with the lights off for a week after finishing the story.

The video ended up going viral. Tens of millions of views and over a million likes. Other book content creators started making summaries and reviews, some people even posted live reactions of them reading the ending. People were speculating on whether or not the killer was actually dead. Would there be a sequel?

Suddenly the book was selling so fast that the small book printer my publishers outsourced to couldn‚Äôt keep up. They had to hire a secondary team, and then a third, all just to print more and more copies.

Edgy teenagers weren‚Äôt exactly my target audience, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who‚Äôs a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That‚Äôs when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn‚Äôt even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I‚Äôd spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn‚Äôt get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I‚Äôm not quite sure when she did drop out, but it‚Äôs safe to say I didn‚Äôt notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn‚Äôt even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she‚Äôd always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month‚Äîour anniversary. We‚Äôd go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do any writing for a whole week,‚Äù I promised. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be just the two of us.‚Äù

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It‚Äôs just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We‚Äôd have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn‚Äôt listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train‚Äîto avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you‚Äôll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.‚Äù

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](http://connorisaacwriting.com)",1,1751828503.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

It was a short message, less than ten seconds. But when I think about it now I think that most of the worst things that ever happen to you happen in ten seconds or less. Probably most of the good things too. Ten seconds is enough time for a lot to happen.

I know it took me less than ten seconds to fall in love when I saw Symone for the first time. Sitting by herself in the corner of the coffee shop I worked at, reading of all things. Beautiful jet black hair, a soft face, and round glasses.

Like any straight college aged guy, it was normal for me to give some glances to pretty girls that walked in while I was working. But normally that‚Äôs all it was, a quick glance then back to work. I never thought that I would be so unprofessional as to flirt with a customer, but for the first and only time in my three years working at the coffee shop, I walked over to this beautiful girl and introduced myself.

We hit it off immediately. We talked about books, our hatred for annoying old people (we both worked in customer service), and found out that we were going to the same college, were both English majors, and we even had some of the same professors.

Months later, she told me that the moment she realized she was going to give me ‚Äúat least one date‚Äù was when I told her how lucky I felt to have a professor as knowledgeable and passionate as Dr. Ridge.

You see, Dr. Ridge was perhaps the most made-fun-of professor in the history of education. During the first day in every one of her classes, Dr. Ridge would show a short PowerPoint presentation over her 17 bunnies, each with names like Dante, Raven, and Beowulf. That wasn‚Äôt the embarrassing part‚Äîthe embarrassing part was that she had a FaceBook made for each one of her bunnies, and they all interacted with each other. Some of them were married and would post about their relationship struggles, only to argue online; some of them were dealing with injuries or illnesses and posted poems about their pain.

As you can guess, this did not go over well in freshman level classes. However, to hear Symone tell it, the fact that I looked past Dr. Ridge‚Äôs quirks to see how intelligent and kind she was, proved that I was worth a shot.

Fast forward to the day of our two year anniversary. I‚Äôm starting my last semester of college and Symone is only a few months behind me. We were at the nicest restaurant I could afford, talking about our future together for the thousandth time: we planned to get married shortly after she graduated and then move somewhere far away from either of our families. I was going to teach high school English while working on my novels, and she was going to pursue her PhD and eventually become a literature professor.

We finished dinner in high spirits and decided to go for a walk around the city. The ground was covered in snow and ice and the street lights reflected off the ground; the way that Symone lit up made her look like an angel. She was the center of the world.

We went through a local bookstore. My best friend Tommy was the clerk and gave me an employee discount on the book of Robert Frost poems I bought for Symone. When we were checking out, an old woman in line told us that we were about the cutest couple she‚Äôd ever seen.

‚ÄúYou look just like my husband and I did,‚Äù she said, then looked at me directly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever let her go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I promised.

Drunk in love, we meandered through the city until we wound up at the underground subway station. In twenty minutes there was a train going to a place in the city we‚Äôd never been through before, so we decided, screw it. We‚Äôd go check it out for no other reason other than to say that we‚Äôd experienced all the city had to offer.

We spent our downtime sitting on a bench and playing sticks with our fingers (if you don‚Äôt know how to play, Google it). Symone was always a much quicker thinker than me. She was better at chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, anything that took brain power. She had just beaten me for the fifth game in a row when I noticed the group of guys on the other side of the tracks.

They were huddled together, but when I looked up they all had their heads turned, staring directly at us. They noticed me and turned back to each other. I figured they were just some funny guys making jokes about us sitting all lovey dovey on the bench. Maybe they were checking Symone out.

Either way, they were on the other side of the tracks. They were the furthest thing from a threat at the time. That‚Äôs why I felt fine excusing myself to the bathroom a few minutes later.

As I was washing my hands, I heard a scream and instantly recognized it as Symone‚Äôs voice. I sprinted out and found her circled by all three men. The tallest one held Symone in a headlock so tight that he was lifting her off the ground. The other two were looking around for witnesses.

When they saw me they barreled toward me. Symone let out a muffled cry.

For a second time slowed. I remember thinking to myself how incredible of a situation this was. Surely this would all just stop somehow, right? This type of thing didn‚Äôt just happen.

But it was happening, and the two men were only a few feet away from me. I had no chance in a fight. Even if it was just one of them, they were nearly twice my size. The one thing that I thought I might have over them, was speed.

Like a wide receiver juking a defender, I feigned as if I was going to run away. Instead, I cut back and ran towards the gap between the leftmost man and the tracks, narrowly escaping a five-foot fall to the bottom. He reached for me, but I lowered my shoulder and barreled through his outstretched arm. I cut to the right and slammed into Symone and her assailant at full speed, bringing all three of us crashing to the ground.

I ended up on top of the tall man and elbowed him in the ribs. As I rolled away, I heard a loud thud and a shriek. One of the other men had tried to grab Symone, but had instead pushed her into the tracks about six feet below us.

I tried to stand, but then the man grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me so that I fell on my stomach and cracked my jaw so hard that I saw stars.

I kicked my feet blindly and connected with his stomach. I got free and halfway to my feet before I was grabbed and put into a headlock.

The grip was so tight I was scared my throat was going to collapse. I flailed about and clawed at hands I couldn‚Äôt see, but as deep as my nails went, the grip never loosened‚Äîuntil we heard the horn.

The train was coming.

Symone‚Äôs on the tracks.

I was thrown to the ground and a heavy boot stomped on my back and knocked the wind out of me. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the fuck out of here,‚Äù one of them yelled. By the time I could stand they were running away.

Symone frantically clawed at the wall, trying to get up out of the trench, but she was a short girl, barely five feet tall. Although she could reach up to the platform above her, the edge was curved, making it too difficult for her to get a firm hold.

I reached my arms down and tried to pull her up myself, but I just didn‚Äôt have the strength. Maybe if we had a little more time we could have worked together, but the train sounded so close. It was going to burst through the tunnel any second.

Once we saw the train, there wouldn‚Äôt be enough time to react. There wasn‚Äôt enough room down there for her to escape its girth.

I allowed myself half a second to close my eyes and think and think and think. I pictured the train bursting through the tunnel and Symone screaming my name, standing against the edge of the tracks as it ran into and through her. I thought about the sound of her bones being crushed, about never seeing her again, about spending the rest of my life without her.

I could try again to grab her, but the result would simply be the same: her getting crushed while we held hands.

There was no getting her up in time. There was only one scenario where I saw her surviving:

‚ÄúGo to the middle of the tracks and lay down,‚Äù I said.

Without hesitation, she let go of my hands, ran to the tracks, and laid down flat on her stomach with her arms firm against her sides.

Just then, the train emerged from the tunnel. Her right arm was resting exactly where the wheels of the train would run.

‚ÄúA little left!‚Äù I screamed.

She squirmed a half inch to the left just as she disappeared underneath the train.

She screamed so loudly that I could hear her over the rumbling. She screamed and screamed until the train came to a complete stop. For a long second I heard nothing except for the train doors opening and passengers holding their conversations that strung together like a bad choir.

‚ÄúSymone!‚Äù I screamed

I flagged down the operator, and he kept the train stationary until Symone was able to squeeze out. Together, we lifted her up to safety.

I called the police and told them what happened, but none of the men were ever caught. I found that to be irrelevant. Symone was safe.

For the next week, she stayed with me at my apartment. She cried in her sleep almost every night, but eventually she felt close to normal‚Äîonly, much less likely to take a late night subway train.

A couple weeks later, we were lying in bed and I was the one crying.

‚ÄúI was so scared you were going to die,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stand to live without you, and I know that it was my fault. I should never have left you alone.‚Äù

She kissed a tear running down my cheek and hugged me close. ‚ÄúBut you knew just what to do. You saved me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to do. I just said the first thing I thought of. I had no idea if the train was going to crush you or not, I just knew I couldn‚Äôt get you out in time. I had to try something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it worked.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy were you so confident in me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHow come when I told you to lay down, you just did it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my boyfriend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always there when I need you; you always do the right thing. I knew you wouldn‚Äôt let anything happen to me.‚Äù

Years later, we had a beautiful wedding at the very same church Symone was baptized in as a baby. I sobbed as she walked down the aisle; we both sobbed as we said our vows; by the time we kissed, our faces were so wet that they slid against each other like two blubbery fish.

We honeymooned in Greece where we climbed the Acropolis. We held hands as we watched the sunset. I promised  myself that, no matter what, Symone would be the important thing in my life. We were both on the precipice, about to free fall into the things we‚Äôd been dreaming about since we were young, and yet, I knew that whether I sold a million books or zero, I was going to love Symone more than anything. She would always be my priority.

Symone got accepted into one of the top English Literature PhD programs in the country, so we ended up moving to an even bigger city. She focused on her classes and worked as a waitress on the weekends. I found a teaching job at a local high school and spent my evenings working on my novels.

It was about a year into this new life when I began to find success. It started small. A publisher picked up my first book, a horror novel, and we were able to get it published in a short time with minimal edits.

A couple dozen people picked up the book, and I got some solid reviews. Every week a few more sales would roll in, and after some months it looked like I might even break even. Then some girl on TikTok made a video with a title like, ‚ÄúThe most disturbing book of 2025.‚Äù She gave a quick, spoiler free summary of my book with lots of gasps and comments like ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe what happens next.‚Äù At the end she said that she didn‚Äôt sleep with the lights off for a week after finishing the story.

The video ended up going viral. Tens of millions of views and over a million likes. Other book content creators started making summaries and reviews, some people even posted live reactions of them reading the ending. People were speculating on whether or not the killer was actually dead. Would there be a sequel?

Suddenly the book was selling so fast that the small book printer my publishers outsourced to couldn‚Äôt keep up. They had to hire a secondary team, and then a third, all just to print more and more copies.

Edgy teenagers weren‚Äôt exactly my target audience, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who‚Äôs a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That‚Äôs when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn‚Äôt even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I‚Äôd spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn‚Äôt get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I‚Äôm not quite sure when she did drop out, but it‚Äôs safe to say I didn‚Äôt notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn‚Äôt even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she‚Äôd always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month‚Äîour anniversary. We‚Äôd go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do any writing for a whole week,‚Äù I promised. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be just the two of us.‚Äù

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It‚Äôs just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We‚Äôd have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn‚Äôt listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train‚Äîto avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you‚Äôll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.‚Äù

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](http://connorisaacwriting.com)",4,1751828480.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

No warnings. Just a final kiss on the forehead at the airport, his hands trembling as he said, Please don't wait for me.

Naturally, Milo waited.

For a week, he drank coffee from the same chipped cup Niko used. For a month, he slept on just one side of the bed, legs curled like a comma. By the third month, the silence got loud enough that he started hearing things.

The stars were the first to speak. Softly at the beginning, like static in the back of a broken radio. Then came the rivers. The electricity in walls. The mycelium beneath concrete.

He could feel the pulse of the universe. Not metaphorically. Literally. Like it was breathing just beneath his skin.

At first, it was beautiful. He‚Äôd stand in the middle of a crowded sidewalk and feel every heartbeat ripple through him. Birds migrating thousands of miles away left whispers in his chest. Raindrops falling in Tokyo made his eyes water in Detroit. Every emotion, every presence, every shift in the cosmos came to him like wind through a cracked window.

He wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.

But then he forgot his sister‚Äôs birthday.

Then his apartment number.

Then the name of the bar where he met Niko; even though it used to be a sacred detail, like the color of Niko‚Äôs eyes in early morning light.

The universe doesn‚Äôt let you hold everything without asking for something in return.

A voice , not a real one, but one that curled in his spine like a dream you wake up holding; told him the rule:
To keep the connection, you have to keep moving. You have to keep living. Make new memories or lose the ones you already have. That‚Äôs the cost.

So Milo moved.

He ate unfamiliar fruit from corner stalls in cities he didn‚Äôt know the names of until someone told him twice. He danced badly at rooftop parties, let strangers kiss him with mint and hope on their tongues. He learned how to say thank you in a dozen languages, even if he couldn‚Äôt remember where he learned them.

With each new moment, a sliver of the past vanished. His first pet. His high school best friend. The smell of his mother‚Äôs perfume.

But never Niko.

That was the strange thing. The universe took so much, but it never touched Niko.

Not his laugh. Not the little scar on his wrist. Not the way he‚Äôd say I love you like a confession he hadn‚Äôt earned yet.

Milo asked the universe once, quietly, as he watched stars bend above a desert in Morocco, why that memory stayed.

The answer came like warmth on skin in winter.

Some things anchor you, even as you drift.

So he kept drifting.

New names. New days. New loves, sometimes. He forgot the person he used to be, but not the feeling that started it all.

Even now, when he sits alone by the sea and lets the whole wide cosmos hum through his fingertips, there's one truth that remains.

He loved someone once.
Completely.

And somehow, the universe remembers.",1,1751828476.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Edgy teenagers weren‚Äôt exactly my target audience, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who‚Äôs a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That‚Äôs when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn‚Äôt even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I‚Äôd spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn‚Äôt get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I‚Äôm not quite sure when she did drop out, but it‚Äôs safe to say I didn‚Äôt notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn‚Äôt even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she‚Äôd always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month‚Äîour anniversary. We‚Äôd go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do any writing for a whole week,‚Äù I promised. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be just the two of us.‚Äù

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It‚Äôs just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We‚Äôd have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn‚Äôt listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train‚Äîto avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you‚Äôll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.‚Äù

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](http://connorisaacwriting.com)",2,1751828450.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

Class act. I really love the location in the middle of the city. Parking was a breeze. Graphics were pretty great, too. We ate at the Hen House before the game, so I didn't get to rate the food. But Hen House was KILLER, holy shit ya'll have some good food. Got coffee at Five Watts and a donut from Glam Doll to bring in as a snack. But getting ice and water was easy! Stupid Sox park CHARGES for ice! 

Really great experience, you guys got it good. I really hope the Sox someday move downtown, it really adds to the ambiance. But I would happily see a game at Target Field again.

1lt90pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1lt90pn/double_whammy_am_and_dink_my_nightmare_story/,Double whammy - AM and DINK. My nightmare story,"Hi everyone been lurking and reading the recent stories on this Reddit about family pressure for same caste and community for AM and also how DINK lifestyles have been gaining popularity. 

Was compelled to share my very long nightmare story which is the double whammy of forced AM and DINK. This is my first post on this forum (took me three days to write it)! This is all my real story - trust me chatGPT could not have made up the stupidity of agreeing for my first marriage just to please my family! 

I come from a Marathi family. Very community centric and traditional. Ten years ago,fresh out of studying computer science I got a job at a tech firm in Mumbai. Hours were long and tiring but my will to make it big kept me going. Started loving the corporate culture (loved meeting fresh faces, different communities and the whole young vibe at work with the beer outings, poker evenings and weekend trips with colleagues that became like family) 

Meanwhile my family started searching for a wife for me. They are extremely conservative and only wanted a Marathi girl for me. Few years ago my sister had married a Sindhi colleague against family‚Äôs wishes and my family were upset with her even though she was in a very happy fulfilling marriage with an amazing partner and then blessed with twins. 

So, with me this time my father was adamant that he will only get me married to a known family‚Äôs daughter (‚Äúyou have to mend what your sister destroyed‚Äù). I was 27 and still staying at home with a salary of only 65k per month. My father is a strong willed and extremely stubborn man and I was afraid of standing up for myself. The women in my family considered my dad a hero so I had no support from them. 
So I gave in and thus entered the dark realms of arranged marriage. 

Next thing I know aunts, uncles and even unmarried cousins were part of this process with everyone deciding who I should spend the rest of my life with. This was also an era when it was considered very prestigious to have a doctor, lawyer, engineer as a DIL. 

And so, my family zeroed in on a family friends daughter from Solapur who was my age but in residency for becoming a gynaecologist. She was the same community as us. Family refused to budge from that girl. ‚ÄúShe will become a doctor. Her career will be secure. She will bring recognition to our family‚Äù etc etc. Without telling, me they spoke to the girls family and got them and the girl onboard. 

I asked to see a photo. She wasn‚Äôt bad looking. Nice actually. She was tall and very fair. Typically pretty marathi looking girl. So I thought ok why not, let‚Äôs meet. We got introduced and began courting. 

At first I was impressed with her strong character and how dedicated she was to becoming a doctor. She spoke about how this was a childhood dream and this was her ‚Äúcalling‚Äù. She was also very conservative and traditional. She dressed very decently (salwar kameezes or jeans with Kurtis) and minimal makeup. She spoke less and was an introvert like me. She had very few friends (most were her doctor colleagues) and was very community centric.  

She became friendly with my family and used to come home every few days to spend time with my parents and grandparents. She used to come at erratic timings depending on her shifts at the hospital. But she made the effort. All day there was only praises of her being sung at home. Everyone at home was floored with her and kept pressurising me to say yes quickly.‚ÄúShe has lot of boys after her, better we at least do engagement and then you can get married later.‚Äù They wanted us to get engaged after Diwali ( I met her in Jan).

However, something didn‚Äôt feel right for me. As we got to know each other better and she became comfortable with me , i started doubting if we were a match. 

 I noticed she never showed a lot of emotion or thought towards family life. She always spoke about how ‚Äúhusband and wife are two individuals on their own paths and marriage is essentially friendship.‚Äù ‚ÄúLife is lived if we have individual success to show as proof or else it‚Äôs a life wasted‚Äù. ‚ÄúNo self respecting woman will live on the laurels of their husband‚Äù ‚Äúmarriage is another word for compromise and why must women compromise‚Äù. 

I didn‚Äôt think much then because ofcourse no daughter in law should be forced to cook and clean etc. but also I was getting attracted to her and honestly didn‚Äôt want to end it immediately.  Plus it was nice having someone to talk to and msg and hang with when free (stupid reasons I know!). We had also shared our first kiss (in the second month of meeting). 

But then soon after the topic turned to kids. It happened out of the blue. One day I was feeling romantic (and gutsy lol) and told her I can‚Äôt wait to have a little baby her running around. She went silent on the phone. I thought I crossed the AM line by indirectly talking about ‚Äús**‚Äù lol. But then what she said shocked me. She said she was surprised I told her this. I asked why? Isn‚Äôt kids a normal extension of family life? 

That‚Äôs when she replied she is a strong supporter of DINK. Most of her doctor colleagues (regardless of what specialty) have decided this and it‚Äôs very common in her circles. In fact she‚Äôs saying she was shocked that I wanted to have kids. Her parents knew about this. 

She has no plans to have children. She said she was never maternal and her life had a bigger purpose than changing diapers and worrying about exams. She said carrying children and eventually leaving your career to look after them is a patriachial concept and she shuns anything that expects women to conform to outdated societal norms. She said she has worked hard to become a doctor and she won‚Äôt just throw away so many years of study to be a stay at home mom. And most importantly she said ‚Äúwhy will I waste my hard earned money on children?‚Äù 

I heard all this and kept quiet. This was not what I pictured for my life. I decided to not tell my parents and deal with her directly first. Was curious to see if there was any wiggle room and have her at least open to the concept of kids. Ngl, I was ok with trying to negotiate with her because honestly she was not bad looking (stupid I know!) and most importantly I was happy that my family is happy and the atmosphere at home is peaceful. Plus I wasn‚Äôt getting any younger m to find someone in school or college. 

I told my sister however and she advised me against the alliance. She said taking a stand against mother and father will be hard at first but living with the consequences of a wrong decision is harder. I told her I will wait a little longer and then decide. Wrong decision. 

Over the next few weeks the girl and I  continued discussing this matter on and off as she was always busy at her residency but then it turned into major arguments. Her choice of words and tonality got more and more strong. ‚Äúno way in hell will I have a child.‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce I have made a decision I won‚Äôt go back on it‚Äù. 

Out of anger I asked her what if you get pregnant by accident ? She said she will be on an indefinite birth control plan, protection will be used strictly at all times and that I should also have myself snipped. That‚Äôs when I was like WHATTTT ?? 

I was shocked she‚Äôs taken this medical decision for me. Deciding to not have children is one thing (as it‚Äôs her body and I respect that) but deciding what I need to do with mine without my own input is another! I i was shocked how she expected me to make all the sacrifices while she wasn‚Äôt budging. I tired to give different scenarios - we will have help at home from my parents to bring up the baby, we will keep a nanny ofocurse but she put her foot down and said ‚ÄúDINK is a decision I have made long ago and I‚Äôm sticking to it.‚Äù  

This happened 3 months into us knowing each other. I finally told my parents and rejected the alliance. My mom didn‚Äôt say anything but weirdly my father started shouting AT ME that I am trying to make things difficult for them by ending matters with her. That I am not a good son. I am selfish and only think about myself like my sister did. Everyone in our family and community knows about this alliance. I should just marry her quickly and She will change her mind about children later. 

When I tried to explain it wasn‚Äôt just about kids, and that her profession keeps her very busy for family life and might not work for us as a family, my dad insisted on speaking with her parents and finding out what really guy happened and how to solve this. They spoke. 

Long story short, our  parents wanted this alliance to happen at any cost and they convinced the girl to talk to me once to come to a common conclusion. 

She called me up within three days. This time she was surprisingly extremely soft spoken and very very nice (big red flag). 

Said she liked me a lot and was ready to compromise if not doing it meant breaking the alliance. She said once she gets her degree and joins her practice and settles down a little (5 years - into her 30s) she will def look into adopting ‚Äúthere are a lot of children in this world who need love. Why born a child when you can help another‚Äù. She was however adamant about not having her own child as this was a decision she made since she was young. 

She promised me that she would look after my needs and give her 100 percent to the marriage. I said I need time to think about the adoption. I had never thought that it would be something I do in my life. It was a lot to take in! 

For the next few weeks she went on and on about the pros of adopting and would send me many news articles and YouTube videos showing the great side of adopting. I watched and read them all trying to understand her point of view. 

During this time my family‚Äôs constant pressure was a big part of my decision (my grandfather used to wipe tears at the dining table saying kids of this generation have no concern for their elder family members, my grand mom said the children of this family are cursed with bad luck, my dad ofocurse gave me the silent angry treatment and my mom kept coming into my room and tidying it and making my favourite foods hoping I will agree. The girls parents would also constantly call up mine and sometimes cry, sometimes be upset etc. ‚ÄúOur families are perfect for each other. You promised us your son. Our daughter is emotionally attached to your son now - how can we do this to her.‚Äù Etc etc 

I was fed up. So stressed at work. Didn‚Äôt want to add more woes to my life. The mental and emotional gymnastics played by my family was wearing me down. Everyday they would ask what is wrong with her. She is known. Our families have known each other since decades. She is from our community so it is a safe alliance (this was a big part of their argument). One day I thought to myself eff it. I‚Äôll say yes. She‚Äôs not bad looking and what‚Äôs the big deal about kids. Kids are kids right. So I caved. I refused to get snipped but agreed to the adoption plan (big mistake). Plus she gave me assurance her career won‚Äôt come between us. 

Everyone at home was ecstatic. We got engaged right after Diwali as planned. Got married in 4 months. 
Went for our honeymoon to Dubai and life began. 

First few months went basic. As this marriage was my family‚Äôs choice, they were extremely kind to my wife. Didn‚Äôt allow her to even lift a finger. Completely supported her career. My mother continued making food for all of us and used to make tiffin for her and give her for the day. Always told her that they were proud of her as a doctor and prayed she reaches great heights. Her clothes were washed, ironed and our room tidied by my mother and maid. 

We always used protection during doing the deed (which btw was very less - she was always tired and stressed with her work. I always initiated and she would make excuses all the time) when we did do it, she was very careful about making sure there were no accidents. It was all very stressful and unpleasurable for me. 

She slowly started missing family and friend events saying her work was demanding and she is under mental stress and physically tired to attend. I started attending most events alone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to come for functions just to prove we are married.‚Äú

Next three years passed terribly. I lost my parents within 11 months of each other. I was very depressed. Work had become demanding as I started a side business to increase our income. We had started living the true DINK life - a corporate/career double income no kids and no ‚Äúfamily support‚Äù. 

I had gotten used to her now very cold and unbothered behaviour. My grandparents needed food and assistance and since both of us were working and my wife refused to cook meals for everyone, they had to shift to my sisters house (she‚Äôs a housewife). 

As the months and years passed my wife became more cold. Work came first for her. She was always tired. Zero effort for me or my extended family and friends. All arguments would be ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a doctor I have responsibilities and life is hectic for me.‚Äù Since she was a gynaecologist , her shift was from 9:30 am till 6:30 pm only. But she would come back home and either just chill on the couch saying she‚Äôs tired or she would come back home and read research papers and study, listen to YouTube videos etc. 

By now 4 years into the marriage, I was cooking my own food and doing my own chores. She was doing hers. I was now 32-33. She was 32. We essentially started living separate lives emotionally. There was no love or sweetness in our relationship. It became so mechanical. As if living with a colleague. Whenever I was down, and would try to discuss with her what‚Äôs made me upset at work, she would tell me we will discuss later as she has work stuff to do or she would tick me off by saying ‚Äúso what if it‚Äôs stressful. It‚Äôs stressful for me also but I don‚Äôt complain. You have to suck it and deal with it if u want to become something in life‚Äù I don‚Äôt disagree with the statement but sometimes u just want a hug and kiss and assurance that it‚Äôs all good and that she is there for you. In a marriage you want love. Since we were double income, financially we were doing well but there was nothing remotely ‚Äúfamily‚Äù about us. 

I started drinking heavily. I used to get jealous of my friends with beautiful families (babies and wives that loved them). I started craving having a child. I wanted unconditional love. Someone to call me papa and just SHOW love to me. I discussed the baby with her.

She started looking for adoptions. It continued a year and a half. That was a whole other story. In short, it was mentally traumatic, extremely stressful and psychologically difficult. The process itself was very tiring legally and with lot of beauraucracy but also every time we would go meet kids in orphanages, I would love to hold them but somehow I was not able to connect. At one point my wife also dabbled with the thought of getting a specially-abled child. I was shocked but spoke her out of it as I knew as a working couple we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do justice to the baby‚Äôs needs. 

The kids were of varied age groups and no matter what I was saying - wow and super on the outside -  but when I reflected deeply the truth was that adoption was not the right route for me. I craved having my own baby.  And why shouldn‚Äôt I ? I was young and virile. 

I became depressed, addicted to alcohol and my relationship with my wife suffered. She started guilting me saying I‚Äôm not showing the same excitement as her because I‚Äôm not a sensitive and caring person. ‚ÄúHow can someone not want to take all the babies home ? They are so cute and need love etc.‚Äù 
Also she kept reminding me that I had agreed for adoption before marriage and now I‚Äôm cheating her by not being supportive. Plus she had first decided no kids but because of ME she had compromised to adopting. So actually, adoption becomes MY decision and responsibility. I was like huhhhh? I hadnt thought of it that way. 

I tried to convince her to have a baby telling her that having our own baby will be quicker than adopting one! But she ofocurse said no. 

Her parents would constantly call up and force me into quickening the adoption process(‚Äúpay bribes and get the work done‚Äù, ‚Äúour daughter is giving you a child and u r not being supportive‚Äù etc 

agree with everything they said but what am I to do? I didn‚Äôt realise that I truly will not be able to connect to the babies. It‚Äôs something that came as a shock to me also.   In hindsight, Adoption was not my first choice before marriage because I always wanted my own children when I have them. But the family pressure  of bringing shame to them and the girls family getting upset with us by rejecting their daughter, and my eventual thought that I‚Äôll be able to manage adoption, was now on reflection, the wrong reasons to agree for this marriage. 

Long story short, two years into the adoption process (which by the way in india is extremely extremely time consuming, corrupt and difficult) our marriage broke. Or rather I literally broke. 

One day after work I went for drinks with friends. They all left in an hour because they had wives and kids waiting for them at home for dinner. I stayed on alone for another 2 hours.  I came home at 11 pm drunk and depressed. 

My wife was fast asleep (she never used to wait for me to come home to sleep.). I changed, got into bed and was scrolling social media. She woke up. Asked me to shut the phone as the light was disturbing her, it was late and she had work early. Didn‚Äôt even bother to ask where I was and if I had eaten dinner. Something inside me snapped at that moment. I very calmly told her ‚Äúfrom tomorrow you don‚Äôt have to worry about the light as this marriage is over. I‚Äôm filing for divorce.‚Äù 

She got up and started yelling at the top of her voice ‚Ä¶ saying marrying me was the biggest mistake. She regrets it everyday. I am traditional and outdated. No self respecting woman of today will live with a man like me. I only want women to cook and clean like how my mother did for me. I don‚Äôt support my wife‚Äôs dreams and career goals. I am a narcissist and misogynist. She also spoke about how I am a liar and a fraud - that I frauded them by agreeing to adoption before marriage but now backing out of it. That her parents had also forced her to marry me because the two families were family friends. 

I reminded her that I had said no to the alliance but she and her family had convinced/forced me to marry.  She very well knew what my views and expectations from my wife were. Yet she and her parents emotionally blackmailed mine. Also she had promised to be a ‚Äúgood wife‚Äù regardless of her career but that promise was broken after marriage. 

As for the adoption I told her I agreed to it before marriage thinking it was better than not having children at all + I had started liking her + family was happy and supported this alliance. I did not myself expect to not go down this spiral when the time finally came to adopt. But I cannot help how I feel. I told her I much rather not adopt a child than adopt one and then not give them the love they deserve. I told her I‚Äôll be happy to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù many children and pay for their education etc but bringing a baby home and connecting with them as a father won‚Äôt be possible anymore. I also told her, I definitely am not into this DINK lifestyle and want a child -my own child - for sure. 

This angered her even more. Remotes went flying across the room and she said - ‚Äúwhat will you divorce me ? I will divorce you and you watch how I will make you dance in court.‚Äù

Soon she moved out and went back to her parents. Our divorce took a 1.5 years to finalise (alimony issues created by her mother and brother + they tried to prove I frauded them because I had agreed to adoption before marriage and now I was backing out of it).  I lost a lot of my wealth  which I painstakingly worked for + a chunk of the inheritance left by my parents. I sunk deeper into depression and feeling of failure. My marriage lasted a grand total of 5.5 years. 

. Of course  my ex-wife‚Äôs family abused me in the community and even abused my dead parents saying they brought up the most terrible son and that they were happy their daughter left an abusive marriage and that she was a beacon of light for all young independent modern Indian women. I had a head and beard full of salt hair to prove the toll this entire chapter in my life  had taken on me. 

By now I had started a small tech business with two other friends as partners and that was doing well.

 A guy with who we collaborated with on a project one day told me he had a friend who he thought was ideal for me. She was coming for his birthday party that weekend so he told me to come as well so I could meet her there. I did. She was a breath of fresh air.  She was of my age and of another caste (Gujarati - Shah) but born and brought up in Mumbai like I was. We realised we even have a few college common friends and used to visit the same bars during our 20s. 

With friends playing Cupid and encouraging us (I had inhibitions after my failed marriage which my friends very nicely counselled me though), we started meeting for coffees which then turned into dinners which then turned into evenings spent together and then full nights. All in about 2 months.

 I must say though that it happened so swiftly becacuse we both CONSCIOUSLY and INTENTIONALLY put in effort into our dating by making sure no ego was there between us - we made each other priority by calling every night without fail, meeting every alternate day and replying to messages ASAP. There were NO games. We wanted to give it our 100 percent. We were both 35 and didn‚Äôt want to waste each other‚Äôs time or be in a situation which would not move ahead for marriage. 

She came from a well to do textile family and used to work for her father‚Äôs business. She was the EXACT opposite of what my family had wanted for me - she was of another caste and community, she loved her whiskey sours and wore tight short dresses. She was short (5‚Äô1‚Äù) and dusky (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and very fair). She had travelled extensively and knew a lot about art, culture, dining etc. She was very ‚Äúwestern‚Äù. She was the first on the dance floor to dance to chaiyya chaiyya and wore strap  blouses to weddings. She had guy friends and lots of cousins and we all went out together. She spoke incessantly and was the life of every party. These were all the things my family had ingrained in me were ‚Äúmodern‚Äù girls who will surely be loose and immoral - unfit for marriage and our family. 

But here‚Äôs the thing - she was also the most loving and kind soul. From the time we got together, for the first time in my life I felt seen and heard. She was sensitive to my needs, careful with my emotions and spoke without ever being harsh or cutthroat. We spent so much time cuddling and tickling each other and just being goofy. I didn‚Äôt even know I could giggle! Haha 

 I remember one time at a friends house party, after dancing with her girl friends, she casually came and sat on my lap in front of everyone. My legs stiffened up in shock. I had never experienced this expression of pda before with my ex wife! How crazy it all sounds now! Such a basic gesture between a couple but I realised I was starved of this for years with my ex wife. 

She never left my bedside when I was ill and recited hanuman chalisa for me all night. She cooked for me (‚Äúexperiments‚Äù she called it) whenever she could and left notes in my tiffin. My favourite food combo became her thepla and thecha haha. She would tell me how proud she is of me but then get annoyed with me why we didn‚Äôt meet earlier in life lol.  She respected my colleagues and made an effort with my friends. She NEVER asked about my ex wife or ‚Äúwhat went wrong‚Äù. She very respectfully told me that is a closed chapter and she does not want to reopen it as long as I am 100percent done with that relationship and there are no lingering feelings. I of course told her everything regardless. 

I finally had someone I could share my emotions with - for the first time in my adult life I laid my head on someone‚Äôs lap and I sobbed after a hard day. She hugged and kissed me all night.

And most importantly she had great respect for my family. She would constantly ask me stories of my parents and how they were and all our memories so she connect with them. She went to temples and prayed for my parents. She convinced me to bring my grandfather back home from my sister‚Äôs (grandma had passed away recently) once we get married. 

Marriage and children came up very early and naturally between us (on the second date I initiated the topic and she didn‚Äôt even blink and we spoke candidly for almost three hours about it). She loves kids and wanted as many as possible. She had also started taking multivitamins etc to preserve her egg quality. She naturally liked staying at home.  That was HER preference. That‚Äôs what SHE wanted to do. She wanted to be at home and raise our children. And after a couple of years start her own fashion label as her father was in textiles anyways. She asked me if that was possible and if I would be able to manage that financially. I said yes. 

Soon we got married. It‚Äôs now two years later - I am now a father to the most beautiful baby girl (who is just like my wife!). We had a honeymoon baby! 

My wife is the most caring soul I have ever met. She is so so loved by my extended family and infact respects my culture and custom much more than my ex wife. She can rattle off Marathi abuses that will put any fiesty Aai to shame! With her gujju family, my Marathi family and my sister‚Äôs Sindhi family, we are one  LOUD and fun bunch! My grandfather is her biggest hype guy and she is of him! 

My friends are crazy about her. My extended family fans her! She has lent a helping hand to all of them in the best way she can. We have a lot of get togethers at home which are a riot! She has never gone to bed a day without me coming home and making sure I eat something (I entertain foreign clients often). She messages during the day checking in if all is ok. I come back home to a woman who WANTS me to come back home. 

Whatever she does for me she does out of LOVE and not compulsion. Nothing is a fight anymore - no fights trying to explain to someone what one must do for the other. It all comes so naturally to the both of us. With my ex wife, it was always her decisions that were written in stone - I had to comply. There was no ‚Äúmeeting midway‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs a beautiful story of understanding each others point of view and coming to a common conclusion knowing BOTH ARE ON THE SAME TEAM. 

She is religious and regularly visits temple and does spiritual tours. I‚Äôve started enjoying them too!  My friends tease us saying she is the Anushka Sharma and I‚Äôm Virat Kohli! Haha .. 

We love date nights with a few glasses of wine and going to nice bars. We laugh and talk and flirt and connect. We play footsie under the table and our galleries are filled with pics of each other.  We are like teenagers fighting the urge of PDA! 

Most importantly she supports me. Never ridicules me. Gives me space to be me. Respects my decisions and loves me unconditionally. I ofcourse do the same for her - it‚Äôs easy to do it when you know the person deserves all the love and respect for what they have shown you. There is no mean cold girl masquerading in the garb of ‚Äústrong independent career driven woman‚Äù. 

I remember one instance when she was pregnant and rearranging her cupboard. I was watching her from the other room. Her her kurta (which had become tight due to her growing belly) kept riding up and she kept pulling it down, exasperated. Then the baby must have kicked so she put her hand on her belly to feel the kick - moving her hands then to her lips and kissing it as if kissing the baby. I remember seeing that and suddenly having my eyes sting with tears. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was was all MINE. I had a wife and baby on the way and was sorrounded by so much love.  I was so so lucky. 

From living a dry barren desert life, my cup now spilleth over. Im 37 and happier than ever before. It took me 10 years to reach here from the dark alleys of arranged marriage to the bright valley of ‚Äúlove marriage‚Äù but now I finally have a reason to wake up every morning. Wife and children are the most beautiful experiences of one‚Äôs life. My home and life feels COMPLETE. Life is not easy ofcourse and juggling financial responsibilities is a lot as we are now a single income WITH kid family (complete opposite to DINK haha) . But, I‚Äôm emotionally fulfilled and it‚Äôs worth putting in hard work to look after my family. 

What my experiences taught me which I hope will help all you AM seekers out there -

1. My divorce was entirely MY fault. I should not have married a girl whose basic life choices was not matching with mine. Simple. I take full responsibility for spoiling two families‚Äô lives and don‚Äôt blame anyone but myself for the crazy ride that was my first marriage. 

2. When a prospective partner says they have decided on something especially since childhood, believe them! It is in their core and soul and means a lot to them. Changing that to what you want or making your partner compromise is a recipe for disaster. When my ex wife told me she did not want children since childhood, I should have believed her and ended the story. Making her compromise to adoption was wrong especially since it was not MY first choice. 

3. On the contrary, if your partner suggests something you have never thought of or need to really convince yourself to accept, it‚Äôs a decision that will haunt you and you won‚Äôt be able to go through with it in the future or regret it if you do do it. Don‚Äôt go ahead with the alliance. No kids/ Adoption was never on my mind since years or childhood. I agreed to this set up only to get married. It wasn‚Äôt truly ME. 

4. Family pressure should be IGNORED. Family has the tendency to go with what is ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù and ‚Äúknown‚Äù and ‚Äúsame‚Äù to them - known family, same community, same caste, familiar profession, same background, same language, same village etc. They do not understand that in today‚Äôs world, ‚Äúsameness‚Äù does not guarantee safety and security in marriage. Everyone is different regardless of how similar their caste and community is to you. It‚Äôs a gamble out there. 

5. Family always emotionally blackmails. Do NOT fall for it. After the marriage no mother, father, grandparent or uncle aunt or neighbour will come to your rescue. Your bedroom matters is YOUR responsibility. You are stuck dealing with it. Post marriage my aging parents couldn‚Äôt sort out any issues that came between us (the issues were very modern and my traditional parents had no idea what to say or do for them). Soon they passed away and I was left to deal with what THEY chose without any of their help. Blaming them was not going to make me single again. I have had to work hard to get over those feelings of blame. 

6. When a prospective partners views don‚Äôt match yours on the big topics like children and career, you need to end it ASAP. I mistakenly continued talking to my ex wife and tried to convince her for children and accepted her profession although I knew I wanted a more traditional marriage set up. In that extra time spent I grew more attached to her and found myself letting go of what was important to me just to have the marriage happen. I should have ended it with her, put my foot down with my parents and politely told her parents. I dragged it too long and then got entangled in an alliance I couldn‚Äôt get out of. 

7. Traditional does NOT equal perfect and compatible. My ex was very traditional and ticked all the boxes of a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù wife but extremely difficult to live with and her views on life were incompatible to MINE. My wife is ‚Äúmodern‚Äù but a breeze to live with and we think like two peas in a pod. 

8. Be open to castes and communities and people who you are not ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù with or who you think your family will not accept.  Remember it‚Äôs the bigger things like how they deal with stress, financial issues, how they show love, how they communicate, how emotionally intelligent they are, how they deal with failures and successes and how they come to decisions when there is a difference of opinion etc  that will sustain your marriage - NOT that your grandparents were neighbours and best friends 5 decades ago. 

9. Lifestyles like DINK, SINK, adoption, surrogacy, IVF etc are BIG deals in a marriage.  Do NOT take it lightly. There are a lot of complicated emotions involved during their process and if you have GRUDINGLY agreed to one of the above just to get married, you WILL be hurt, upset sad and depressed finally ending in divorce. 

10. For adoption in particular (since I dealt with it)  - I think for something like adoption which involves another human being, the couple should go through professional counselling together for at LEAST 1000 days to make sure this is truly what THEY want and not just one of the partners. It should include visit to orphanages and other adoptee families for many years.  I got convinced for adoption over a few months under family pressure that no other girl was better suited for our family and it‚Äôs a small sacrifice  - it was NOT in my soul to do so and it was not something I always wanted. I started the adoption process in excitement but as I got into it deeper over the two years, my true feelings surfaced. With gods grace the adoption process took 2 years during which I had the guts to accept and voice out that it‚Äôs just not for me. I dread to think what would have happened had the adoption gone through earlier. No child deserves to not be loved. 

11. SINK, DINK etc are major life decisions and only be with a partner who ALSO wholeheartedly believes in it. My ex wife wanted a modern career-friendly DINK set up. I wanted the opposite. None of us were wrong in what we wanted -  we were just wrong for EACH OTHER. It was an incompatible match. On the other hand my wife always wanted a traditional marriage. So it worked with us. 

12. When someone says they strongly believe in something and then they change their view after you reject the proposal, just to save the marriage - DO NOT fall for it. after I said no to my ex wife initially, her family convinced her to continue with me and she the came back and told me she has changed her views and is now willing to adopt and will make sure her career doesn‚Äôt come between our marriage etc. This was their desperation and fear of the alliance ending, talking. I should have figured out then and there that NO one can change such important childhood decisions in a few weeks. There is no guarantee that post marriage they will adhere to the change of view because it was just said to get the marriage going. If this happens, DUMP the alliance ASAP because it is not a sustainable feeling/decision. 

13. most importantly, reflect on who YOU TRULY are and what YOU TRULY want. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed or shy to admit what you are looking for in a partner and expect in a marriage. ALL choices are valid. what is wrong is knowing you want something but agreeing to someone who you know cannot fulfill it. I wanted a homebody wife who would lead a domestic life with my children  but I married a career driven woman who decided against kids.  Ofocurse it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. Never get guilted by family and friends into believing that what you want goes against what is ‚Äúright‚Äù in today‚Äôs society. Your choice and beliefs matter. 

14. Lastly s** is a very important aspect of marriage. Please be with someone who is s******* attracted to you and whose needs match yours. With my ex it was a battle to get her to agree. I always initiated. She completed it like it was a chore. I spent a lot of time solo-ing it. My wife and I now are like bunnies haha. Just fyi, my now wife and I slept together on our fifth date. By then we had spoken for weeks and had built trust and love for each other. Not going into tmi, but omg, it was amazing. She was fun, uninhibited in bed and obviously interested in sleeping with me. I couldn‚Äôt believe someone actually WANTED to do it with me! The whole experience was different to what I was used to. Crazy how so many years of a bland s** life had me thinking I was undesirable huh?!

Well this was my very very very long journey to a happy marriage. Hope it helps someone in figuring out a difficult proposal and making the right choice for THEM.  At the end of the day YOU matter and honestly it‚Äôs YOUR lifelong battle. 

DO NOT PUT YOUR HEAD ON THE BUTCHERS BLOCK JUST TO PLEASE YOUR FAMILY. 

Wish you all the very best and hope everyone gets the happy ending their deserve! 

P.S - for those curious about what happened with my ex-wife, I‚Äôve been told by my extended family and community friends that she is in a very happy relationship with a doctor colleague who is also not keen on having kids and has the same working culture and mindset as her. They are starting a joint practice soon and marriage is on the cards eventually. Looks like the divorce and finding the right-minded partner helped her bloom too!
However, her parents and brother (especially) and her still spread bullshit about me and my family to anyone who wants to hear.
Seeing our complicated story, lots of parents in our traditional community have now given their children the freedom to choose who they like as partners. Everyone knows divorces are expensive!

1lt9054,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheThendi/comments/1lt9054/aitt_for_feeling_that_im_misunderstood/,AITT for feeling that I‚Äôm misunderstood ?,"Me and my partner work in 2 different cities - we live near the border. He has 30 minutes of commute by car and I‚Äôve 1h commute despite taking the highway. 

It was my 3rd day at my new workplace and I left at 6:45 am to reach work by atleast 8 am since I had a meeting at 9 am, for which I wanted to prepare. Also to avoid traffic. I got a call from my partner at around 7:45 am saying he couldn‚Äôt find his set of keys. Then I realized that I‚Äôd left home with both sets of house keys by mistake. He was pissed off and he kept asking me to come back home to drop it off. 

I apologized but I said I can‚Äôt drive all the way back and forth. There‚Äôs no way I would reach work before 9:30 am. So I asked him to take a wfh day. We both prefer working on-site and we rarely do it unless in case of emergencies. Well, this was one such exception. He was pissed off and dropped the call. I called him again and he said he‚Äôll stay home for the day. 

Upon reaching work, I sent more apology texts and he didn‚Äôt reply. So I gave him his space for the rest of the day. When I returned home, I said sorry again and that it was an honest mistake. I even offered to pay for dinner takeout, which he accepted. But then he kept on making snide remarks as if I‚Äôm some kind of monster. 

I‚Äôm very particular about stuff at home. I don‚Äôt like things strewn all over. As long as he‚Äôs his laptop and TV, nothing bothers him. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years and I‚Äôve told him a thousand times about things that bother me. For example, he would leave coffee mugs all over the house and the only way it would make its way to the dishwasher is when we don‚Äôt have anymore mugs, he would put his laundry on top of the basket rather than open the lid and put it inside, etc. I don‚Äôt understand the fucking logic here and so yeah, I get worked up when I see that he doesn‚Äôt bother. Sometimes I make him put things back where they belongs. I agree, I can be very difficult when it comes to certain things. 

As per his logic, it was reasonable of him to ask me to drive back and forth for 90 minutes because I make him put mugs in dishwasher and clothes inside laundry basket. He insists that if it were him who‚Äôd left with my keys, I would have made him come back all the way to drop the keys. All this despite me saying that, I would‚Äôve declared wfh if that were the case. 

I‚Äôm no saint, but I‚Äôm also no cruella. I like things a certain way in my home. I feel he‚Äôs holding back some kind of contempt, because this is not the first time he‚Äôs made similar remarks. 

I‚Äôm not angry, but I‚Äôm disappointed. That this is how he feels about me. I‚Äôve not spoken to him since he made said those things. I would rather be alone than be misunderstood. I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs even worth holding on to this relationship.

In-Depth Review!,"Testing coffee makers every morning gives me a strong sense of what works and what doesn‚Äôt, and the Proctor Silex 48351PS Coffee Maker stood out during my trial runs. This 10-cup drip coffee machine has an approachable design that‚Äôs built for simplicity. While it isn‚Äôt aiming for the hardcore barista crowd, it promises convenience for anyone craving quick, fuss-free coffee.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was its compact size, measuring about 7.75""D x 9""W x 11.88""H. That makes it small enough to fit into my relatively tight counter space without cramping the style of my kitchen. The modern black aesthetic blends well anywhere, and the unit feels decently sturdy for its lightweight build‚Äîweighing only 3.85 pounds. The borosilicate glass carafe looks durable and, from my experience, stays smudge-free even after multiple uses. Plus, the Lift & Clean brew basket is a breeze to remove and wash, whether with hands or in the dishwasher. Noticing its semi-automatic operation mode, I immediately realized it‚Äôs tailored for simplicity over complexity.

**Ease of Use and Key Features**

Brewing coffee with this machine is as intuitive as it gets‚Äîjust load ground coffee and water, press the button, and voil√†‚Äîhot coffee in no time. A helpful on/off indicator light ensures I won‚Äôt forget to turn it off (which happens more often than I‚Äôd like to admit). The Auto Pause & Pour feature? Absolute lifesaver. I tend to grab a cup midway through brewing, and the machine accommodates this without spilling coffee all over the plate. However, keep in mind there‚Äôs no programmable timer or fancy brew strength adjustments here‚Äîbasic functionality is its core appeal.

[Check Proctor Silex 48351PS Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0089me5vq/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

Despite its simplicity, the drip coffee maker produces consistently hot, smooth coffee. While it might not deliver coffee that rivals artisanal caf√©s, it‚Äôs pleasantly flavorful for daily consumption. The appliance works with paper filters, which I found straightforward to use despite my knack for fumbling with coffee gear on occasion. It brews up to 10 cups, which came in handy during family visits. That being said, brewing smaller batches occasionally lacked the same balance in taste‚Äîsomething I noticed when making just two cups.

**Highlights**

- Compact and lightweight for tight kitchens.  
- Auto Pause & Pour prevents brewing interruptions.  
- Dishwasher-safe carafe and brew basket.  

**Caveats**

- Absence of programmable brewing or advanced settings.  
- Coffee taste can dwindle slightly with smaller brews.  

**Smart Plug Compatibility**

An often-overlooked feature here is its compatibility with smart plugs. By connecting this coffee maker to Alexa, Siri, or Google Home-compatible smart plugs, you can power it on via voice commands or integrate it into a daily routine. I connected mine to an Alexa-compatible plug, and it was incredibly convenient when my hands were tied with morning chaos. Bear in mind, however, the smart plug isn‚Äôt part of the package‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to buy one separately.

**Competing Products**

When comparing with similarly priced options like the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, there are noticeable differences. The Black+Decker offers programmable timers but lacks the compact size that helps Proctor Silex fit snugly into smaller kitchens. Similarly, a machine like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew dual coffee maker offers single-serve versatility but comes at a higher price point and takes up more counter real estate. The Proctor Silex strikes a balance with affordability, simplicity, and space efficiency, making it a value choice for non-fussy coffee drinkers.

**Value for Money**

This coffee maker sits firmly in the budget-friendly category yet packs enough functionality to justify its cost. It won‚Äôt have you raving about groundbreaking features, but for straightforward drip coffee brewing, it ticks the essential boxes without overcomplicated extras. Whether for casual coffee lovers or those just setting up a basic kitchen, it matches expectations for its price point.

The wait is agony, as I stand there waiting for whatever torment awaits me, whispering to myself, ‚ÄúWhat have I done to deserve this gruesome punishment?‚Äù The air is hot and humid, and I can feel the sweat dripping from my body as my clothes stick to my skin. Crammed into lines like a can of sardines. What torture could be worse than this? I wait for hours, my back begins to ache, and the soles of my feet burn, then the smell comes. The smell of bodies rotting, the strong musk and odor emanating from everyone‚Äôs pores. It smells like a corpse that has been decaying for weeks.

I become anxious and claustrophobic as I look up at the line. My eyes play tricks on me as I peer forward, as the line grows longer than a mile. I think to myself, maybe this is the punishment, perhaps the torture is the waiting. An endless line is my fate. That‚Äôs when I hear the screaming. I listened to the screams and pleas of the people ahead of me. Some yell at the top of their lungs only to be silenced by the demons that receive them. Sometimes I could hear crying saying, ‚ÄúThis cannot be. I have waited so long!‚Äù Only to be sent to the back of the line.¬† A horror I hoped not to face. A horror worse than the one at the end of the line. I then touch my face, only to feel the bags starting to form under my eyes. The coffee does not help. It tastes stale and old, as if it has been three days since the last batch was brewed. I cannot stomach it; its taste is foul and repulsive. I almost vomited, but that would lead to me going to the back of the line, and I could not bear another minute of this torture. I swallowed my vomit and kept going. It is finally my time to reach the front of the line, and the demon that awaits gives me a forced smile and says, ‚ÄúWelcome to the DMV, how may I help you?‚Äù.",1,1751827690.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Fateful decisions

I sat in my truck,, my eyes lost in that thousand yard stare¬† that had become the normal end of a day for me when there wasn‚Äôt really enough time or energy for the next thing on that ever growing to do list.¬†¬† So much of that energy was being consumed in that ever raging battle going on between my ears,¬† one that left me with little hope, little rest and little enthusiasm for much of anything else.¬†¬† Of late it seemed like these mental shut downs were coming earlier and earlier in the day.¬†¬† Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the lack of sleep, but it was far too early in the evening to be staring vacantly at the windshield in front of me and still somehow managing not to see anything at all.¬†¬† ¬†

It had been about two months since I had cracked my egg‚Ä¶..those first weeks of euphoria and joy that it might be actually possible to exist as some version of me that I actually liked had soon faded, washed away by the river of tears that telling my partner had unleashed.¬†¬† The storm cloud unleashed by that revelation had swept into our relationship with it a cold and harsh truth.¬†¬†¬† That nothing is that simple or easy.¬†¬† That as much as I might want this‚Ä¶..nobody else in my life would and I would be faced with the hard choice of risking losing everything that I loved‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for what?¬†¬† A dream that I didn‚Äôt even know if it could actually come true?¬†¬† Sure it seemed like it could come true for others, but how certain could I be that it would for me?¬†¬† How sure could I be that it would be worth whatever it cost?¬†¬† This was the firefight that raged in my head as I sat there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.mostly avoiding going back to a house that was feeling less like home with each passing day.¬†¬†

Once the river of tears had subsided, my partner had set into the issue with the usual methodical approach she used to deal with nearly everything in life.¬† She began to do her research online and then quickly decreed that both of us needed to be in counseling. ¬†¬†Our conversations began to feel more like interrogations than the relaxing banter of two partners once the work was done.¬†¬† I wasn‚Äôt doing particularly well with the questioning .¬† Part of it was a retreat into the familiar emotions of self-loathing and shame that had surrounded by existence for the last thirty years of my life‚Ä¶.part of it was feeling like I was being crammed into boxes courtesy of ¬†whatever the latest google search ¬†had yielded for her.¬† ¬†I was beginning to feel like so much of the online narrative didn‚Äôt really fit me at all.¬†¬†¬† No..I didn‚Äôt want to paint my nails, or have her do my makeup, or have my ears pierced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the last thing I wanted to do was look at the mirror and see a guy in drag staring back at me‚Ä¶..that had always been the thing that had gutted me to core on those times when I had cross dressed‚Ä¶.the thing that had filled me with far more shame than the fact I had tried on women‚Äôs clothing.¬†¬† I simply wanted to exist as I was‚Ä¶.but as a woman‚Ä¶..or at least as close as I could get.¬†¬† I just sure I wasn‚Äôt sure I would survive that attempt.

¬† It had already become fairly clear that our relationship wouldn‚Äôt, she had quickly moved to the position she loved me‚Ä¶.but our relationship was over if I decided to transition.¬†¬† Her body language suggested that our relationship was already over‚Ä¶those small touches of intimacy, those gentle windows into the kindness our souls hold for each other had all but disappeared from our day to day interactions.¬†¬† At night when I wrapped my arm around her, she no longer snuggled into it‚Ä¶but lay still and motionless until I finally withdrew it and she could get herself wiggled into a more comfortable position to fall asleep.¬†¬† This was the death of a relationship in real-time, the slow painful business of watching the most beautiful thing in my life dry up and whither in front of my very eyes‚Ä¶.knowing all too well that I was the poison responsible.¬†¬†¬† My words, my thoughts, my wishes and desires‚Ä¶..my very existence.¬†¬† In that one conversation I had shattered the illusion of the person she thought she shared her life with, right now she was heart-broke and angry at the world ‚Ä¶.and somehow I completely understood.¬†¬† ¬†¬†And hated myself for it.

She had been able to find a counselor fairly easily, for me it had been much more difficult.¬†¬† Some of that difficulty was the fact we lived in a fairly rural area, some of the difficulty was the fact that I had a healthy fear of the vicious natures of small town rumor mills.¬†¬† At the time the VA was being a little more generous regarding this topic, and I had reached out to them with a request for counseling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but like nearly everything else with the VA it was a lengthy wait to do anything‚Ä¶including even being contacted back sometimes.¬†¬† Eventually I had been able to find a counselor in a city an hour away, but so far those conversations had been far from productive or helpful‚Ä¶..it seemed like she wanted to talk about anything but why I had sought counseling in the first place.¬†¬† It was becoming apparent that she thought her job was to convince me to be happy with the body I had without trying to change it. ¬†¬†I was supposed to practice saying positive affirmations in the mirror.¬†¬† All of it rang so hallow and flat.¬†¬† I‚Äôd spent thirty years of my life (the portion I could actually remember) hating my body and knowing exactly why and how I wished it was different.¬† It hadn‚Äôt gone away in all that time.¬† ¬†These weren‚Äôt things you could change with diet or exercise.¬† There was a chance that maybe they could with HRT.¬†¬†¬† I was hoping to either get access to HRT and help navigating the social difficulties that would surely entail‚Ä¶‚Ä¶or get slapped upside the head hard enough with reality that I quit wanting this.¬†¬†¬†¬† Neither seemed to be happening or even likely to happen at all‚Ä¶certainly not a recommendation for hrt‚Ä¶...all we seemed to be doing was wasting time.¬† Time I didn‚Äôt really have.¬†¬† In between sessions I would listen to clips on you tube or podcasts while going about my daily tasks.¬†¬†¬†¬† When I had used the term dysphoria, that revealed to my counselor I had been trying to do research on my own on the internet. ¬†She became indignant and told me that I needed to quit trying to look things up on the internet, that doing so wasn‚Äôt going to help anything.¬†¬† I decided I was tired of wasting my time visiting with her once a week.¬†¬† My partner decided that was a sign I wasn‚Äôt even trying anymore.¬†¬† Our home had taken on a sense of living death‚Ä¶.one that hasn‚Äôt quite happened yet‚Ä¶.but one everybody knows is inevitable‚Ä¶..but doesn‚Äôt really want to talk about.¬† ¬†¬†That was what I was trying to avoid as I sat here in my truck not yet going home‚Ä¶.that and all of the guilt and sorrow and self-hatred that came with it.¬†¬†

It was getting harder and harder to turn that key over each night.¬†¬† Everything seemed to so impossible‚Ä¶.why was it that what my heart wanted more than anything else in the world‚Ä¶..had to be this?¬†¬† Had to be something that so much of society considered morally and physically disgusting‚Ä¶an insult against the God who had created me‚Ä¶..A lie.¬†¬† Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me that I should get over this nonsense and quit thinking about these things.¬†¬†¬† Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me I was an awful person for the fact I was thinking about these things.¬†¬† Inwardly I knew‚Ä¶..I probably wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.I hadn‚Äôt managed to quit thinking about these kind of things in the thirty years I could remember‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs just, things had gotten so much worse since I had found out that I actually could do anything about it.¬†

I‚Äôd always lived those voices in the back of my head‚Ä¶..at least as long as I could remember‚Ä¶.the ones that told me that I should just punch out and let that time card flutter to the floor‚Ä¶.that the world really didn‚Äôt need me in it,¬† that the world would be better off without me in it,¬† that the people I cared about would be better off too‚Ä¶.all I ever managed to do was drag them down‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all I was capable was making them as miserable as I was..¬†¬† Those voices had been pretty loud the last several weeks, morphing from their normal good morning hello waiting to be drowned out by coffee into a constant cacophony that left me feeling so exhausted and defeated.¬†¬† So far in life I had managed to weather their call out mostly out of duty‚Ä¶.there was also was one more task that needed done first‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt want to force somebody else to have to pick up the mess of unfinished tasks and projects I was responsible for‚Ä¶..didn‚Äôt want to force somebody I knew to have to clean up the mess of a successful suicide.¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure how many times I had heard that admonition that suicide was for those who were too selfish to care about all the pain they would leave for everybody else in their lives.¬†¬† In some ways I knew that was true‚Ä¶.I‚Äôd seen the way it left deep scars in families that lasted for generations,¬†¬† known personally the way the suicide of one of the soldiers I had served with had left me with the sorrow of senseless waste and the guilt of wishing I had reached out, the guilt of thinking maybe, if I had been a better friend I would have known he was even struggling.¬†¬† I didn‚Äôt want to leave that for my family‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt want to leave the trauma of having to find my body or have to identify it‚Ä¶.I‚Äôd done enough hard things in life to know it was pretty hard to un-see bodies.¬†¬† I didn‚Äôt want to do that to them.¬†¬† The voices called out‚Ä¶.‚ÄùDo you really think any of that is worse than having a grown-a@@ kid who decides to become trans?‚Äù¬†¬† There was a whole host of slurs that came with that one that seemed to be despised at a whole different level.¬†¬† My family was fairly religious,¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure which was worse‚Ä¶..to have a kid who offed themselves because they were failure versus spending the rest of their lives listening to the whole town talk about what a failure that kid was‚Ä¶..and how much they had failed as Christians in teaching said kid how to live¬† his life.¬†¬†

¬†¬† I didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶..just that I was tired of this battle‚Ä¶tired of the same voices every night‚Ä¶tired of the same problems that never went away.¬†¬† ¬†¬†Tired of feeling dead inside‚Ä¶..that spark of hope that had come with finding out that being transgender was a thing some people survived had run smack dab into some fairly serious questions of whether I would.¬†¬†¬† I wasn‚Äôt so sure‚Ä¶.I was already struggling‚Ä¶.I‚Äôd always struggled‚Ä¶..what made me think I was strong enough to make that journey?¬†¬† What made me think that journey would be worth the costs?¬†¬† The alienation?¬† The scorn?¬†¬† The choice to be something it seemed that so much of society completely despised?¬†¬† By now I had given this idea of an alternate me a name‚Ä¶..Everything about the culture and society I lived told me I should kill her‚Ä¶.to bury her so deep she could never came back‚Ä¶.never threaten to ruin my life again.¬†¬†¬† Somehow that felt just as heavy as the idea of taking my own life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Maybe heavier.¬†¬† I actually wanted to be her‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not sure I had ever wanted to be me.¬†¬†¬†

A few days later I blew out the candle on my birthday cake.¬†¬† Forty years‚Ä¶.without a whole lot to show for it‚Ä¶.at least not a whole lot I was particularly proud of.¬†¬† Someone wise cracked‚Ä¶.‚ÄùMake a wish.‚Äù¬†¬† And for the first birthday in my life‚Ä¶.I actually did.¬†¬† I wished I could actually do this‚Ä¶..and then I pinched out the candle because it was one of those annoying ones that kept coming back to life and I didn‚Äôt really want to cover the top of the cake in spit.¬†¬†

A week later I started hrt‚Ä¶there was a certain amount of fear and apprehension as I let the pills dissolve under my tongue‚Ä¶.I was trying to DIY with grey market materials I was able to obtain without a prescription‚Ä¶definitely not a route I would recommend.¬† There were reasonable questions of whether the pills I had obtained actually had the levels of estradiol and progesterone claimed to be in them or whether there was anything else in them that might kill me or otherwise ruin my life.¬† It was a risk.¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure why I was okay with taking it.¬†¬† Was I desperate?¬†¬† Just reckless by nature?¬†¬† I wasn‚Äôt sure, only that I hoped this path led in the direction I wanted to go.¬†¬†

In truth it only sort of did, sublingual delivery would be an incredibly ineffective route for me‚Ä¶.I would spend the first two years of my journey self-dosing at levels well below where they needed to before I finally started working with an endocrinologist.¬† Doing HRT has been so much effective since.¬†¬† The decision to start HRT without being upfront about it with my partner or seeking her approval would be the final blow to our relationship, ¬†one that destroyed what little grace or trust she was still willing to extend me.¬†¬† Of all the regrets that have come with this path‚Ä¶that is one of the heaviest‚Ä¶.Her rejection and departure would end up stinging far less than the knowledge that she deserved far more respect and truth than I gave her and that I truly do deserve her contempt‚Ä¶.not for being trans but for the ways I failed to live up to the basic tenets of relationships‚Ä¶.honesty, communication, care and compassion.¬†¬† That weight, and the weight of watching her heart break will be mind to carry for a long time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..a long, long time.¬†¬†

Whether I survive this journey will always be ¬†‚Äústill to be seen.‚Äù¬†¬† Everything about life is uncertain, I have lived a life that has taught me far too well that tomorrow has never been promised‚Ä¶.that each day that comes is a privilege and a blessing‚Ä¶.an opportunity we make daily get to make a choice in how we spend.¬† That each time we make it to nightfall with the same number of friends and loved ones as we began the day with is a luxury‚Ä¶.a luxury that somewhere, somebody won‚Äôt receive. ¬†¬†In truth, for me, those voices never went away‚Ä¶..but they have at least quieted down‚Ä¶..content to simply exchange morning greetings or poke their head in during rough patches.¬†¬† Eventually I was able to get that counseling from the VA,¬† During one of those sessions I told my therapist that suicidal ideation and I were like old friends‚Ä¶neither of us really scare each other anymore‚Ä¶ we might talk to each other fairly frequently but ¬†both of us know I won‚Äôt actually do anything.¬†¬† She didn‚Äôt seem to think that was nearly as humorous or as amusing as I did.¬†¬† All the same, I‚Äôve learned that so much of making through it‚Ä¶is simply hanging on‚Ä¶.one day at a time....and if you can‚Äôt believe that things could ever get better for you‚Ä¶.then you hang on to try to protect the people you care about‚Ä¶and when even that fails‚Ä¶.for spite and stubbornness‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and believe it or not, sometimes it really does get better.¬†¬†

For me, it would get better.¬† It took a while, it took some work, but somewhere along the way I learned that I could be a person worth liking, that even ‚Ä¶..even if I was trans, that I could be kind and considerate, that I could still make people laugh, that I could hold my head high, that my-self-worth and relationships with other could be determined by my character and conduct and not just a label or whatever stereotypes people might have associated with that label.¬†¬† There is so much in life I‚Äôm not particularly proud of, but there are also things to be proud of.¬†¬† I will include in that small list, the storms I have weathered, maybe not the fact those storms existed, ¬†there was certainly room for improvement in the way I weathered most of them, some of them were of my own making‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm still here, still trying to learn and grow, still trying to learn how to become a better person, still hoping I can help make the world a better place, even if I‚Äôm not always sure what exactly looks like.¬† Maybe some of that is just privilege or luck, but I‚Äôm starting to understand is a heck of a blessing.¬† And somewhere along the way,¬† I‚Äôve discovered I‚Äôm capable of still having some really good days, that life really is worth living.¬†¬†

Mom said it would be ‚Äúgood for me.‚Äù A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn‚Äôt argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma‚Äôs eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you‚Äôd see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don‚Äôt know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, ‚ÄúIt keeps the birds out. Don‚Äôt want them crows eating our corn Benny.‚Äù

Grady didn‚Äôt answer at all.

But at night, I‚Äôd hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn‚Äôt use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That‚Äôs when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn‚Äôt where it should‚Äôve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.‚Äù

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn‚Äôt laugh back.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. It was‚Ä¶ Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn‚Äôt scream. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

‚ÄúYou went into the corn, didn‚Äôt you!?‚Äù he said, not angry. Just‚Ä¶

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

‚ÄúYou better get inside now,‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs seen you!‚Äù",2,1751827577.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

### The Setup

Inter Miami, the defending Supporters‚Äô Shield champions, are chasing their first MLS Cup. They‚Äôve got Lionel Messi (who‚Äôs scored 41 goals this season, because *of course*) and a squad that‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ *selectively* available due to Club World Cup duties. New England, meanwhile, is the kind of team that makes you wonder if ‚Äúplayoff contention‚Äù is code for ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not terrible.‚Äù

**Key Stats:**

* **Inter Miami**: 1.9 goals per game on the road, 6th in the West with 32 points.
* **New England**: No stats provided, but let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ *meh*.
* **Head-to-Head**: Inter Miami has the edge in recent matchups, but New England‚Äôs home form? Unknown.

**Injuries/Updates**:

* Messi is fit and available (for once).
* Inter Miami‚Äôs squad is ‚Äútired but motivated‚Äù after the Club World Cup. New England‚Äôs roster? A mystery.

### The Verdict

**Best Bet**: **New England Revolution (+270)**  
Why? The math says so. New England‚Äôs underdog status is undervalued by bookmakers. Inter Miami‚Äôs fatigue from Club World Cup travel and their recent 1-4 loss to PSG (yes, *that* PSG) suggest they‚Äôre not invincible. Bet on the Patriots (of New England, not the NFL ones) to pull off the shocker.

**Secondary Play**: **Over 2.5 Goals (1.54)**  
Inter Miami scores 1.9 goals on the road. New England? Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre not a shutout machine. The Over 2.5 (-110) is a safe, high-probability play.

---

### Final Jeer

Inter Miami‚Äôs Messi might score, but New England‚Äôs defense? A sieve. Bet on chaos. And maybe bring a coffee. It‚Äôs 5 a.m. in India. You‚Äôll need it.

*‚ÄúThe only thing more predictable than Messi scoring is the bookmakers‚Äô math.‚Äù* ‚Äî Your friendly neighborhood sports handicapper, who‚Äôs definitely not a gambler.

For more information, you can find it here [AITAH for telling my Mum that I didn't want to know her after she walked out 14 years ago. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kloy39/aitah_for_telling_my_mum_that_i_didnt_want_to/)

But the TL;DR.

I am a 16F, and I am living with my Dad who has 100% sole custody of me. He has had custody since I was 2.

My parents had me when they were both quite young (my Dad was 18 and 'Mum' was 20), and 'Mum' couldn't cope with how my existence and having to be a mum inconvenienced her education and social life. She wanted to enjoy university, going out drinking, and my existence got in the way of all of that. Therefore she upped sticks and left my Dad to raise me by himself.

She's made a few attempts over the last couple of years to reenter my life. Her first attempt she tried through my dad, and when he spoke to me about it, I told him that I didn't want ot know her. He returned that message her.  
And the most recent attempt by her occurred the other month. Only this time she bypassed my dad and messaged me directly.  
I admittely blew up at her and took a lot of my frustrations out on her.

Eventually though she respected the fact that I needed to concentrate on my GCSEs and she asked if we could meet up after I was done.  
I then spent a while trying to figure out what I should do. I spoke to my dad about it and he gave me his full support on whatever my decision would be.  
In the end I did agree to meet my mum in a public place and we met up yesterday at a coffee shop.  
My dad dropped me off and I asked him to stay close by to pick me up when I was done, so he went and did a bit of shopping for our upcoming trip away together.

I understand that this is getting to be quite a long ready now, so I will try and keep it as simple as possible.

But basically my mum started giving me an emotional story on how she has spent the last 10+ years regretting not being in my life.  
She told me that she was young when she walked out and was really unsure what she wanted in life.  
I responded that I can understand that she was young and becoming a mum at her age must've been incredibly difficult.  
But I pointed out that my dad was also young, younger than her in fact. But he stepped up and became a single parent, to the detriment of his own future dreams and relationships.  
So whilst I could sympathise with her, I still couldn't accept it as being a good enough reason.

I could see that those words really stung her and whilst I knew that she was being genuine, I still couldn't forgive her for that and I did tell her that.

She then informed me that her children (my half siblings) would really like to meet their older sister and she showed me their photos and was telling me stories about their life.  
This honestly felt like a stab to the heart. Because a mum talking about her children, sharing photos of them, etc is what I spent my life wanting.  
In the end I had to ask her to stop talking about her children. Because hearing these stories was bringing up the pain of the mum that I always wanted but never had.  
I also told her that no matter how much she tries, I wouldn't ever see her children as being my siblings. We didn't grow up together and we don't know each other. They are nothing but strangers to me and no different to the children that I see walking past me in the street.

My emotions did get the slight better of me here and my mum did see my agitation growing.

I won't bore you with every thing that was said. But by the time that we were done with our conversation and were getting ready to leave, my mum got the wrong assumption thinking that this wouldn't be the last time that we'd meet up. Because she thanked me for giving her this opportunity to spend time with her eldest daughter and how she hopes that we can continue to heal our relationship.  
I had to stop her there, and this is where I am now second guessing on whether I was too harsh.  
Because I told her that under false illusion does this mean that we will one day have a mother/daughter relationship.  
I only gave her this time with me so that we could both say what needed to be said for the closure that will allow us to move on from each other.  
I don't right now and never will I consider her as my mum.  
Yes she is the woman who gave birth to me and I will always be thankful to her for how she carried me for 9 months and gave birth to me. However that doesn't mean that I will ever see her as my mum.  
She began to get rather emotional at this point, but I just had to ignore her so that I could finish what I wanted to say when I told her that I consider myself as only having one parent, my dad.

And before we went our ways whilst she was still trying to get her emotions under check whilst begging me to reconsider giving her a second chance, I felt that I had to be brutally honest when I requested that she doesn't contact me or my dad again. And that if I ever wanted to speak to her again, that I would be the one to reach out to her.

I'm not heartless. The pain was honestly eating away at me as I watched my mum getting more and more emotional, and I was struggling to keep my own emotions under control. Because I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I knew that I had to make my message crystal clear to her that I don't want anything to do with her. Not now or any time in the future.  
It was only when I met up with my dad and got into the car that I finally broke down and cried hysterically.

My dad has given me his full support. He's reassured me that he'll always respect my decision. Whether I want my mum in my life, whether I want to go LC or completely remove her from my life. He will always support me and I really appreciate his support.

His support has given me reassurances that I've done the right thing. However whilst speaking to my best friends, they've been conflicted on the matter.  
They feel that I've been too harsh on my mum and that I should've been more responsive towards repairing a relationship with her. They believe that I should try and give her a second chance otherwise I might one day regret it.  
I asked them to change the subject because I didn't want to talk about her anymore. But it did leave me wondering whether I was too harsh on my mum when she was trying to give me a genuine apology for all of her wrong doings. Because she has accepted full responsibility for what she did and that there is nothing that could excuse what she did 14 years ago.  
That makes me feel like my friends were right and I was an AH to my mum when we met up. But I am just confused right now.

My dad has offered me the chance of seeing a therapist for everything that I've been through, but I am reluctant.  
I am foolishly hoping that once I've been on this holiday with my dad and when we return home, these events with my mum will be in the distant past.

Oh and to finish off.  
In my last post, I had a number of comments telling me that my dad should chase my mum for child support.  
I did discuss this with my dad, but it's not something that he wants to do.  
He says that we're fine financially and he doesn't want to deal with the stress of going through the legal system (which can be slow) and end up in a prolounged legal battle with her.  
He's also got concerns that this would maybe give my mum more of incentive to try and forceably be more involved in my life. Because she's now 'invested' money into me and that would give her a legal right to having some form of access to me.",72,1751827554.0,AITAH,23,0.95,False

Im a nurse and I finished my shift and was supposed to spend my night with my girlfriend and her family I texted ahead of time telling them to leave me a plate since il be coming later after work (I‚Äôm a nurse) anyways once I got there it was maybe around 8 or 9 and I walk in and greet her family as usual and I met her brother for the first time (m28). So I do the polite thing and make small talk with the family for a bit and catch up then I go find my girlfriend(f25)and ask her for the food I texted her to set aside she says she got my text and did leave me a plate but her brother got to it because he wanted a 3rd plate of food. I was fine with this and decided il just go eat something else later and go back to talking with the family and after a while they all start drinking and letting off fireworks but I‚Äôm not a drinker nor do I like fireworks so I stay inside with their dog since dogs get spooked by fireworks. Anyways after a while her brother comes in drunk off his ass (I guess he can‚Äôt handle his alcohol) and tries to start a problem saying  some dumb shit about how Im not a man or whatever since I‚Äôm a nurse and I‚Äôm small ( im 5‚Äù9-10 he‚Äôs 6‚Äù1) and I let this go because as a nurse Ive had patients scream worse stuff at me but I guess he didn‚Äôt wanna let it go and start saying shit like you better not hurt my sister or I‚Äôm gonna do this and that again I pay no attention to this baboon because he‚Äôs drunk. Anyways he is ends up getting angry and punches me and first hit the dog because he stumbled then swings again with his other hand and hit me in the jaw hard which il give him credit for but at this point I‚Äôm in my wits end and this is where I might be in the wrong but I grab his head and just slam it into the coffee table out of a fight or flight reaction it was easy since his balance was off. By now the dogs whimpering in the corner and my girlfriend comes in screaming at me saying I hurt her brother which I get but again I was defending myself. We end up arguing leading the rest of her family joining in and im not in the mood so I grab my coat and remove myself from the situation and get into my car and drive about 2 hours to my cousins house, me and her are both excommunicated from the family (different story) but we are very close and she was spending her 4th with her wife and her wife‚Äôs sister and I give them the run down. Long story short I spent the 4th with them got food and went and slept at the wife‚Äôs sister‚Äôs house. (Shes really nice) The next morning (July 5th) I wake up to a breakup text from my now ex, and honestly I just didn‚Äôt care. 

What I wanna know is AITAH if I don‚Äôt apologize to her brother and her family

And

Should I shoot my shot my shot with my cousins wife‚Äôs sister? (We just click together and shes also in the medical field as a surgeon in a different hospital so she understands my stress and jokes)

Two weeks ago today I broke up with my girlfriend of over three years (both 22F). We started dating our freshmen year of college. We were both 18 and neither of us had ever been in a relationship before. I think a lot of what went wrong can be attributed to us being young and dumb, but now that I'm out of it there are a lot of behaviors I find myself questioning.

Whenever a disagree turned into an argument, she would threaten suicide or self harm. She'd say things like ""I just want to jump off the balcony right now"" ""you make me want to die"" ""I should just kill myself"" and more. She would scream them at me. I'd tell her if she's serious I'd call 911 or drive her to the ER. She told me this shows I didn't care because what I ""should"" do is stop arguing and comfort her.

She would also use this when I would say I couldn't come to her location to discuss in person if we were talking on the phone, like if we were both at our parents' houses. Usually she'd say she wanted to kill herself then hang up and not answer any subsequent calls, only for her to call back and apologize when I was halfway there. Whenever I addressed this, she said she knew it was wrong but felt like she needed to do something ""drastic"" so I would show I care.

She did other things for this same reason. The first one was breaking up with me. She must've broken up with me at least a dozen times throughout our relationship only to take it back a few minutes later claiming she didn't mean it. I would continuously tell her it's really messed up to put someone through that emotional turmoil, but it never ended. In addition to this, she would always slam doors. To the point I was worried she'd actually take one off the hinge and we'd lose our security deposit. I remember one time she repeatedly opened and slammed my bedroom door while staring me straight in the eyes.

There were also a lot of double standards in our relationship. She could go visit family/friends whenever on short notice, I had to ask her permission no matter how far ahead. She could try new coffee shops, restaurants, and stores with her friends, I could only go with her. She could talk about how hot her favorite celebrities were, I couldn't say my doctor wished me a happy pride without being accused of being in love with my healthcare provider.

I enjoy doing acts of service for my partner. I would often volunteer to carry her suitcase or grab her groceries. However, we were rear ended at high speed in Feb 2024 and this exacerbated a high school lifting injury. On top of some formally torn muscles and a ruptured disc in my back, I then had nerve pain in my legs. Pain I was told by my physical therapist to avoid as best I can to prevent weakness. Despite this, she would get upset when I explained I couldn't carry heavy objects to our third floor apartment anymore. She would use this to take jabs at my butch identity and say I didn't care about her like I used to. When I request similar help, I was turned down each time.

There are many more situations I could go on and on about, but these are the ones that bug me the most. Still, I feel like it's over-dramatic to call this an abusive relationship. I genuinely loved her and I know she genuinely loved me. I'm just so conflicted. I don't think toxicity captures what happened either. Did anyone have a similar experience? How would you define this?

1lt8npx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lt8npx/i_worked_on_the_cursed_farm_and_something_grew/,I Worked on the Cursed Farm and Something GREW,"I used to be a respected agricultural engineer. I'd been invited to speak at conferences, my published studies bore my name, I was someone with a future. But all that ended a little over a year ago when a wrong technical decision caused an entire crop, financed by international investors, to rot. They blamed me. The company fired me. And within weeks, my name became a punchline among colleagues. Since then, no lab or farm has even been willing to see me for a conversation.

When I found this job offer, I was sleeping in my car and barely eating. The ad seemed strange‚Äîshort, direct, no company logo, and a free email address for contact. It didn't pay much, but it offered lodging and food on an isolated farm in rural Pennsylvania. Most importantly: it didn't require references. Maybe I should've been suspicious, but I accepted on the spot. Getting there was like crossing an invisible border into the past. The road was dirt, streetlights were rare, and cell service disappeared as the woods closed in.

The farm looked like it had been forgotten for decades. The main house had windows covered with old boards and doors that creaked at the slightest touch. There was a small greenhouse, an open field, and a barn covered in ivy, as if the vegetation itself was trying to reclaim everything. But the soil‚Ä¶ the soil was alive. You just had to look to see it: no irrigation, no fertilizer, yet plants grew everywhere with absurd vigor. The smell of the earth was intense, almost too sweet. That bothered me from the beginning, but I didn't say anything. I needed that job. More than that‚ÄîI needed a reason to keep existing.

\*\*\*

For the first few days, I tried to act like everything was normal. I'd wake up early, drink my instant coffee, and head straight to the field. The supervisor who hired me never showed up‚Äîhe just left me an envelope with basic instructions, a map of the property, and an old key with a red ribbon tied to it. The house where I was staying was old, but functional. It had electricity, running water, and a small kitchen with canned goods. There was a generator in the basement, but it didn't seem to have been used in a long time. The light came from somewhere, but I didn't know where. I didn't question it.

The cultivated field stretched across a clearing behind the barn. The soil was dark and loose, almost wet, as if it had just been watered. But there were no irrigation systems, no signs of recent rain. Still, small green seedlings sprouted spontaneously in rows that looked hand-planted. I wrote everything down in my notebook: soil type, root depth, humidity, pH. The numbers didn't make sense. It was as if the land regenerated itself. But that didn't worry me. On the contrary. For the first time in months, I felt useful again.

At night, I wrote reports on the old computer left in the office, with peeling wallpaper and a musty smell. The emails never received replies. I sent them as protocol, but I knew no one was reading them. I started getting used to the silence. There were no neighbors. No cars passed by. The only sounds came from the wilderness‚Äîthe chirping of crickets, the wind cutting through the tall trees, and, every now and then, a deep rumble, as if something heavy was moving underground. At first, I thought it was my imagination.

But on the third night, I heard footsteps. Heavy. Slow. Coming from the field, as if someone was walking on dry leaves. I looked out the window and saw nothing. The next day, the seedlings had almost doubled in size. They measured exactly 53 centimeters. And each row was perfectly aligned with the other, as if someone had adjusted them overnight. A shiver ran down my spine, but I preferred not to overthink it. It could be a coincidence. Or maybe I was just too tired.

I decided to check the surroundings. Behind the barn, I found a small greenhouse, locked with a padlock. The key with the red ribbon worked. Inside, there were old measuring instruments, pots with soil samples, and a blackboard with formulas written in white chalk. None of them made sense to me. A phrase written in crooked letters caught my attention: ""The earth responds when it is heard."" Beside it, a faded photograph showed a group of five men in lab coats, kneeling in the field, their hands buried up to their elbows.

That night, I dreamed I was lying in the field, with the earth slowly opening beneath my body. I didn't scream or struggle. I just sank, being covered by warm, pulsating roots. When I woke up, there was dirt under my fingernails and mud on the soles of my feet. My whole body was trembling. I began to believe that something was deeply wrong there, but even so‚Ä¶ I continued. Not out of courage. But because, deep down, something in me wanted to know how far it would go. As if I knew, from the beginning, that this story wouldn't end well‚Äîbut that even so, I couldn't look away.

\*\*\*

It was on the eighth day that I began to understand that what was growing there wasn't just organic. The plants spread at an abnormal rate, but the strangest thing was the soil's behavior. In an area near the greenhouse, I dug a hole to collect deeper samples. I found a compacted layer of intertwined roots, as if someone had sewn the earth with living fibers. Some seemed to pulse slightly when touched. Further down, my arm hit something rigid. When I cleaned it off, it was a tooth. Human.

My immediate reaction was panic. I threw the shovel away, trembling, and stumbled out of there. I thought about calling the police, but there was no phone signal, and deep down, something told me no one would answer even if there was. I went back inside the house and tried to convince myself that maybe it was just an ancient remnant. A skeleton buried decades ago. Something normal on old farms. But I couldn't believe it. That same night, I opened the cabinets in the house looking for any clue. Behind a loose shelf, I found a hole in the plaster that led to a small cavity hidden in the wall.

Inside, there was a metal box covered in dust. Inside, typewritten documents, photographs, and something that looked like a diary. I read everything that night, unable to stop. The papers belonged to someone named Dr. Raymond Alcott, a botanist who had worked on the farm between 1963 and 1966. He had been hired by a private group called ""Project Vespera,"" whose objective was ""to investigate the limits of soil as a conscious medium of evolutionary symbiosis."" What that meant exactly, even he didn't seem to know at first. But the diary was clear in describing his experiences.

According to Alcott, after a while, the soil began to respond to emotional stimuli. Plants sprouted faster when someone was afraid. And stronger when there was fresh blood in the earth. One passage said: ""I lost an assistant yesterday. He cut his foot on a rusty hoe. We let him rest in the greenhouse. The next morning, the vines had grown 40 centimeters towards him. He said he heard whispers coming from the earth."" Another fragment sent chills down my spine: ""The earth doesn't just react‚Ä¶ it remembers.""

From that moment on, I stopped sleeping properly. I started hearing noises from upstairs‚Äîeven though I knew the house was single-story. Short whispers, like people talking behind the wall. When I opened my bedroom door one night, I found fresh muddy footprints leading to my bed and disappearing into thin air. The plants invaded the porch in the morning, covering the steps with leaves too large for the growth stage I had observed. Something was interfering with the biological cycle. Or reinventing it.

On the computer, I reviewed one of the old image folders. I found a series of low-resolution videos. In one of them, a group of men was clearly seen kneeling, as in the greenhouse photo, mumbling something while thrusting their hands into the earth. In the lower corner of the screen, the date: October 31, 1964. The following images showed the field at night, illuminated by torches, with figures standing silently around a circular mark of earth that looked burned. A distorted audio accompanied the scene: ""It grows when it feels. It grows when it devours.""

I turned off the lights in the house that night. I sat in the dark, watching the field through the window. The ground seemed to move. Not like an earthquake‚Äîbut like a breathing organism. The plants trembled slightly, even without wind. The living earth, like the chest of someone sleeping. A slow, ancient breath. The next morning, I found roots coming out of the cracks in the kitchen floorboards. Some seemed to follow me as I walked.

Even with all this, I didn't leave. And it wasn't out of cowardice or stubbornness. It was as if something within me already knew I couldn't escape. As if everything that happened was inevitable. Part of a cycle that had already begun even before I arrived there. I started feeling pain in my chest and stomach. In a fit of desperation, I looked at myself in the mirror and thought my eyes were‚Ä¶ darker. As if something was growing behind them. I started wondering if I was even myself, or if I was turning into soil.

\*\*\*

After that week, my sense of time began to fail. I no longer knew if it was Monday or Saturday, if it was seven in the morning or two in the morning. The plants no longer followed the sun's cycle‚Äîthey grew at night, before my very eyes. A sprout I pulled out in the morning was back by the next afternoon, larger, thicker, as if it had returned with anger. I began to realize that everything on the farm reacted to my presence. My footsteps left marks in the field that didn't disappear. My footprints seemed to sink deeper than before, as if the ground wanted to pull me in.

The worst, however, was inside me.

The pains I felt in my stomach intensified. They started as cramps, then turned into a constant pressure, as if something was pushing from the inside out. One morning, I felt a sharp pain in my chest and fainted in the bathroom. When I woke up, there was dried blood on my shirt and dirt between my teeth. I don't remember how it happened. In the sink, there were thin, red roots, spread across the drain, like small filaments of an organism that wasn't mine.

The house also began to change. The windows, once covered by boards, were now completely sealed by a mixture of vines and rotted wood. The back door disappeared overnight. Literally vanished. In its place, only a wall. The electricity stopped working, but the generator continued to emit intermittent noises‚Äîeven without fuel. One day, as I walked down the hallway, I felt the floor give way slightly under my weight. I looked down and saw a crack opening, slowly. From within it came a sweet, almost suffocating smell, like rotten flesh covered in flowers.

My nights became disastrous. I dreamed of underground corridors full of branches, with human figures buried up to their necks calling my name. One of them‚Äîalways the same one‚Äîreached out to me and said, ""You didn't come to plant. You came to feed."" I woke up sweating, trembling, and with my body covered in scratches that weren't there when I fell asleep. Once, upon waking, I found words written in dirt on the living room wall: ""It's growing."" I tried to erase it, but the stain returned the next day, darker and clearer.

I became a prisoner of the farm, and it seemed content with that.

The canned food ran out, but I no longer felt hungry. The tap water tasted like iron, but I kept drinking it anyway. It was as if my body wasn't exactly mine anymore. One afternoon, I observed my arms under the sunset light. There was something wrong with the texture of my skin‚Äîsubtle grooves, as if plant veins were forming under the epidermis. I scraped my arm with a kitchen knife. Thin fragments of wood came out, as if I were splintering tree bark.

My mind began to truly unravel. I started hearing voices coming from the field, not like echoes, but like thoughts that weren't my own. They whispered phrases that seemed ancient. Some in English, others in languages I didn't recognize. One day, as I walked among the rows of plants that now reached my waist, I noticed the stems turned slightly towards me. When I stopped, they also stopped moving. When I took a deep breath, they vibrated. And when I screamed, they all bent at once, as if listening to me. Or obeying.

I tried to run.

I packed the little that was left and ran to the edge of the property. The road that had brought me there was covered by vegetation. Trees that hadn't existed before blocked the way. My feet sank into the mud. The wilderness seemed to have grown meters overnight. I tried to cut through the hills, but the terrain repeated itself, as if I were walking in circles. After hours, I returned to the farm without realizing it. The house was different. Grown. The roots now covered part of the roof and the field seemed wider, deeper, like a dark sea about to swallow me.

On the porch, a wooden box waited for me. Inside, there were seeds. Many. All irregularly shaped, some seemed to pulse slightly when touched. There was a handwritten note, in shaky handwriting: ""Only what feeds grows."" Behind the house, a new flowerbed had formed. All by itself. With enough space for an adult body.

I sat on the porch and stayed there until nightfall. The sky turned purple, then black. The stars seemed more distant than usual. I felt my chest open in silence. The farm no longer needed to convince me. It already possessed me.

\*\*\*

The next morning, I woke up in the middle of the field. The plants were so tall I could barely see the sky. I was lying on a bed of leaves, roots, and damp moss, as if the earth had taken me in during the night. My whole body ached, but I found no visible injuries. When I tried to get up, I realized a thick root was across my leg. It didn't trap me, but it was there‚Äîlike a warning. A gesture. The earth holding me without force, just to say: ""You belong to me.""

I stumbled back to the house, but found the front door locked. I tried the side window. Blocked from the inside, covered by a crust of vines that seemed soldered with resin. I walked around, trying to find any entrance, and that's when I saw it. The field stretched to where there had once been forest. The horizon had changed. The world around the farm was being swallowed. And I understood, at that moment, that what was growing there wasn't just vegetable‚Äîit was memory, it was flesh, it was history rooted in soil too old to have a name.

In a surge of desperation, I ran to the greenhouse, which miraculously was still accessible. Inside, the light was green and opaque. The air was thick. In the center, there was a metal chair surrounded by broken pots and rusty instruments. I knelt there and rummaged through the floor with my hands. I didn't have to dig much. Just below the surface I found more papers, kept dry for some unknown reason. It was a second diary, from another man. A name I didn't know‚ÄîThomas McKellan. The notes seemed confused, as if he was losing his sanity as he wrote. But one page hit me like a blow.

""It's not the earth that needs to be cultivated. It is the one that cultivates. It cultivates the mind, the body, the memory of those who step here. The plants that grow are just the surface. What truly grows‚Ä¶ is us.""

There was a drawing there. Not a plant. But the silhouette of a human body with roots instead of legs. And under the illustration, a single word: ""Seed.""

My vision blurred. Sweat ran down my eyes and the words began to spin. I stumbled out of the greenhouse, gasping, my stomach churning. I vomited a dark, thick liquid, with fibrous pieces. It was as if my own body was trying to expel what was no longer part of it. But nothing came out of me. On the contrary‚Äîwhen I looked at the ground, the vomit had already been absorbed. The earth seemed thirsty. It accepted everything. And returned it stronger.

I staggered back to the field. The sky was lower. I can't explain it. It was as if the clouds had descended, and the atmosphere had thickened. Every breath was a struggle. Every step, heavier than the last. When I reached the center of the plantation, I saw a perfectly clean circle of soil, without any plants, like an altar. In the center, a narrow opening in the ground, twisted like a living wound. From it came a muffled, irregular sound. It sounded like breathing. Or perhaps a heart.

And then, for the first time since I arrived, I heard the voice of the earth. Not a whisper. A clear voice, with an ancient timbre, deep as millennia-old roots. It said only one sentence: ""Come back inside.""

I fell to my knees. My arms trembled. The ground under my fingers pulsed, as if it had veins. And I understood. I understood that I had nowhere left to run. That the reason I was called, hired, led there‚Äîwasn't to work. It was to be absorbed. The farm was not a place. It was a cycle. An organism. A buried god, fed by ages of silent sacrifices, erased histories, planted bodies.

I remembered the tooth. The names on the papers. The whispers. The box with seeds. The phrase on the dusty glass: ""The earth responds when it is heard."" I had listened. I had responded. And now it was too late.

The sky exploded with thunder. A dense rain began to fall, but it wasn't water. It was a thick, oily, almost viscous liquid. The plants seemed to vibrate under the rain, growing visibly, blooming in seconds. In the center of the circle, something began to emerge from the crack‚Äîa structure made of roots, flesh, and wood. It wasn't human. It wasn't vegetal. It was a symbiosis. A reflection of what was to come.

I tried to scream, but my voice was lost in the heavy air. My body gave way. I lay there, feeling the earth slowly envelop me, like a warm, damp blanket. Roots climbed my legs, entwined my arms, pressed my chest gently‚Äîas if to say that everything was alright. That I was finally returning to where I belonged.

And before my vision faded, I looked at the sky one last time. The clouds drew faces. Eyes. Scars. And I understood what it meant to grow, in that place. It wasn't to bloom. It was to sink. It was to yield. It was to allow the earth to make of me what it had always done with everyone: fertilizer for the next harvest.

\*\*\*

I don't know how much time has passed since that day. Maybe hours. Maybe weeks. I no longer sleep the same way. When I close my eyes, I see roots forming beneath my skin, connecting my flesh to the soil that now pulses beneath my feet. The house, if it even still exists, is buried somewhere in the field. The field that now has no end. The earth has expanded, silently, like a disease that grows without pain, only with time.

I walk without direction. I feed on what grows here, but what grows is not food. It has no taste. It has no form. It just exists. And, for some reason I no longer try to understand, it sustains me. My body still functions, but I feel no hunger, no thirst, no cold. Only the weight of being alive in a place that won't let me die.

There are days when I hear other voices. Ancient whispers coming from the soil. Some are familiar. Names I read in the diaries. Muffled screams of those who came before me and also tried to resist. Sometimes, when I get too close to the opening in the field, I hear prayers. Laments. Other days, the silence is complete, but no less oppressive. It's as if the earth is watching me, always waiting for the moment to pull me in for good.

And I feel it's close.

The roots no longer move only beneath my feet. They are already inside me. I dream of branches growing behind my eyes, of flowers opening in my chest. I wake up with the taste of wood in my mouth. I try to spit, but nothing comes out. With each passing day, I feel less anger, less fear, less desire to escape. Not because I'm accepting. But because I'm changing. Becoming part. An extension of what has lived here since long before any man arrived.

And perhaps this is the destiny of all who cross this boundary.

\*\*\*

If you found this account, you might think I'm crazy. Perhaps you'll think all of this is the result of isolation, hunger, or some undiagnosed mental condition. And, honestly, I once thought so too. But with time, doubt disappears. Reason dissolves like dust in dark water. What remains is no longer thought‚Äîit is belonging. I am not lost. I am where I should be.

Today, I understand that farm wasn't built. It was awakened. And it continues to awaken, slowly, as more people touch it, study it, feed it. It doesn't matter if you believe it or not. The earth believes in you. It remembers. It keeps everything. Every step, every voice, every body that once breathed upon it. Here, death is not the end. It is the beginning of germination.

I am not writing this to ask for help. I no longer need it. There is nothing left to save. I am writing to warn you. So that you, who might one day think of crossing an old fence, digging where you weren't called, or accepting jobs no one else wants‚Ä¶ stop. Turn back. The offer may seem harmless. The place may seem empty. But the earth‚Ä¶ the earth is never empty. It just waits.

If you hear the earth call, as I did, do not answer. If you feel it watching your steps, do not look back. And if it touches you‚Äîeven lightly‚Äîrun. Do not let it whisper your name. Do not let it see you as a seed.

Because once planted, you don't grow upward.

You grow inward.

And what grows from you‚Ä¶ is no longer human.",1,1751827393.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

So 3 months ago I went to the dr cause I was having chest pain. My BP was 198/105 they made me stay in the office for the whole day to monitor me I guess to make sure I didn't have a heart attack. They ended up putting me on norvasc. I was living horribly, at the time i was running on 6 months of never getting more than 3 hours sleep. I'm 37, i work 80-90 hours a week, im a full time student in my 3rd year. I have a 3, 2, and at the time a 6 month old. My wife and I worked opposite schedules as much as possible to avoid childcare which is double our rent a month if they went full time. I had gained probably 30-40 lbs in 6 months and I started smoking cigarettes again and was up to about a pack and a half a day. I was also drinking like a pot of coffee and 1 - 2 energy drinks a day to make it through each day. I also have crazy adhd. I started smoking weed when I was 16 and for me that was the cure for adhd. So much so that in school I was a c or d student and after I never didn't get an A. When this happened they told me I need to not drink caffeine anymore, no cigarettes, no sodium, no weed. I gave everything up at once, it was hard mentally but nothing had real effects except weed. In school I had a 4.0. After I stopped smoking weed I could barely get a D on anything. I ended up failing all my classes at the end. I had A's in everything and this happened right before midterms. I tried to retake some in the summer and im now failing them all again. At work I was a super high performer and never made mistakes. Since then I have made a bunch of mistakes and some have been very costly. Ive worked woth my company for 10 years and the owner sat me down and told me he is putting me on leave for a month and he hopes I can figure this out because he doesn't want to lose me. I just had to tell my wife, who ive been with for 13 years, and now she is starting to talk about separating finances and has been spending a lot of time at her parents. I was a great dad and husband but now If im home I just find myself pacing back and forth for hours not really interacting with anyone much. I haven't been able to watch a whole episode of something. I loved playing games but that's out the window now. I was on page 580 of The name of the Wind, a book i was super into, 3 months ago. Today im on page 585. My life is falling apart. I talked to the Dr and they told me its all mental and I absolutely cannot start smoking again and I cannot be on add men's as they are worse than weed as far as BP goes they said. Idk what to do. My goal of becoming a cpa seems dead now. I'm about to lose my job. I'm about to lose my wife and kids. My only options are to continue down this path and probably end up homeless. Or start smoking weed again and fix everything but probably have a heart attack. Im at a loss and maybe looking for some advice or really anything.

 **All In**

My eyes were bloodshot. Pins and needles prickled through my limbs, starting in my fingertips and spreading down to my toes. Three days. It had been three days since Chris was taken, three days without sleep, staying ever vigilant, tracking the movements of the newly increased staff. I downed another shot of espresso, the bitter taste no longer a shock, only feeding the nervous energy twisting inside me. My brain screamed for rest, but every time I closed my eyes, paranoia clawed at the back of my mind. Did the staff notice what I was doing? Why did that passenger look at me like that? Could she be working for the bus? My pulse quickened. I shook my head violently, trying to knock the cobwebs loose. I needed to focus.

My plan was starting to come together, but everything felt more fragile with each passing minute. Since Chris was taken, the staff had ramped up their presence, standing like sentinels to keep the peace. The once impenetrable door was now doubly fortified, with more guards constantly watching. I noted every shift change, every step they took, scanning for a weak point in their routine, anything I could exploit. The other passengers? They had retreated further into themselves, more distant and detached than ever, their apathy gnawing at my already frayed nerves.

I couldn‚Äôt take this much longer. My mind was unraveling. I had to act, and I had to do it tonight. As far as plans go, I thought, mine wasn't terrible. First, I needed to collect all of my things so that I could act at a moment's notice. Second, I needed to wait until dinner. For the last few days, the staff had been more lax while placing food out on the buffet. And thankfully, the passengers were too scared to say anything even if they were to notice me. Third, while the staff were preoccupied setting out the food, I would sneak into the staff access corridor. It was risky, but I figured the hall would be relatively empty because the staff would be feeding other passengers. Fourth, hope for the best. As the thought hit me, I slumped in my seat. A lot of this plan revolved around ifs and did little to set my slipping sanity at ease. 

Little by little, I grabbed my belongings, taking my time to hopefully not attract any attention. Dinner was drawing near, and my knees began to shake, and my palms began to sweat. Adrenaline was coursing through my entire body all at once, causing me to feel queasy. I looked down at my watch, 7:27 PM, I had just over thirty minutes to go over my plan one last time to make final preparations. I headed back to my secluded seat to wait out what time I had left when I noticed someone waiting for me. Alarm bells in my brain rang incessantly. Had someone discovered my plan? How? My face turned white as a sheet, and I nearly vomited where I stood. I had to keep my composure; no one knew anything. How could they? I hadn't spoken to anyone in days. As I neared the seat, I saw it was the old man from a few days ago.

""Oh, hey there, youngster."" He greeted. ""I seen you been awful quiet these last couple days. I hope I ain't intrudin' or nothin.'""

""No, not intruding. Just getting ready for dinner."" I said, with a forced grin.

""I'm sorry for all your friends gettin' nabbed, I know this place can get kinda lonely."" 

""Oh, it's, uh...it's nothing,"" I muttered, nervousness straining my vocal cords.

""Nonsense, I seen it's been eating you up, and I'd hate for you to make the same mistake that young lady did."" I nearly fainted from fright. Was he on to me? ""I just wanted to stop by and say that if you need anything, I can always make time to chat. I ain't been able to sleep good since what's 'er name up n left, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I let it happen again."" I stifled a sigh of relief when it dawned on me that he knew nothing about my plan, but a pang of guilt loomed heavily on my shoulders. When I leave, will this kind old man blame himself? Before I could say anything else, the sound of carts being pushed down the hall echoed throughout the cabin. I looked down at my watch, 8:00 on the dot. Time was of the essence so my conscience had to wait. I thanked the man for his concern and quickly brushed past him. 

I clutched my bag with a death grip, almost as if I strangled it hard enough, it would increase my chances of success. My temples pulsed with adrenaline as I stealthily moved up the aisle. My heart thumped like a war drum with each step, but I remained on guard; none of the staff's movements went unnoticed. When suddenly a staff member locked eyes with me. For an endless second, their gaze felt like it burned right through me, making me uneasy, as if they could read my mind. I quickly popped into a crowd of people, hoping it would mask my intentions, my eyes locked on the staff corridor. A bead of sweat rolled down my forehead into my eye. I released a breath I wasn't aware I was holding, trying in vain to calm my blazing nerves. I moved with the mass of people like a herd of cattle being brought to a feeding trough. Feeling sufficiently incognito, I poked my head out of the crowd, scanning the room for any staff looking my way. To my utter horror, however, I noticed something I had never seen before. There was a guard at the access door. My heart sank, and I paused. Every neuron in my brain fired all at once. There was no way I could get in there undetected. No way unless... Without thinking, I screamed, ""Stop shoving me!"" and wildly pushed a passenger into a staff member rolling a food cart. Food exploded everywhere, plates clattering to the ground. Gasps and shouts filled the air as passengers stumbled over each other in the chaos. The staff member‚Äôs face twisted in annoyance as they bent to clean up the mess, giving me the window I needed.

I slunk back into the crowd of people, hoping no one would pin the incident on me and be able to sneak away from the crowd unnoticed. I held my breath, willing myself invisible as I slipped from the edge of the fray. Once I emerged, everyone was focused on the mess. Everyone, including the guard. Absorbed in the chaos, they took a precious second to turn their back on the door. Just the second I needed to close the gap and enter unnoticed. As quickly and quietly as the wind, I snuck to the door, fearing that any second, I would feel someone slam up against me like they did with Chris. But that moment never came. I reached the door unmolested and equally important unnoticed. I opened the door, grinning ear to ear. The sheer joy in my heart at the improbability of my plan working nearly made me scream, but my elation was quashed as I saw what lay in front of me. 

The hall stretched endlessly in every direction, doors stacked on doors, walls twisting like veins in some enormous beast. Buzzing fluorescent lights cast cold, flickering shadows, each corner a portal to more uncertainty. It wasn‚Äôt just a corridor; it was a nightmare come to life. My stomach churned, and for the first time since stepping on this bus, I felt truly lost.

 I gawked, mouth wide open, and a tear rolled down my face. Whatever this place was, I thought, it wasn't a bus. My stomach dropped, and a wave of terror rushed over me. I thought I‚Äôd been braced for anything, but this‚Ä¶ I collapsed to the ground in a heap. Exhaustion had taken hold of me. It took every ounce of willpower I could muster to keep my eyes from closing. I gritted my teeth and forced myself into a sitting position. For an eternity, I sat there, not knowing what to do or where to go. I knew I couldn't stay, but I didn't know where to begin either. Chris and Misty could be anywhere if they were even still alive. The weight of realization hit me like a runaway train. 

The walls seemed to close in on me, mockingly. I felt a lump in my throat form and tears would have followed if I hadn't been so utterly spent. Suddenly, the doorknob behind me rattled, and instinctively, I jumped to my feet and locked the door. I was no longer safe and had to make a decision. The rattling on the door became louder and louder. There was a door down the hall, not thirty feet away. I had no idea where it would lead me, but it was my only choice. With my energy reserves running on fumes, I raced as quickly as I could to the unknown door. I gripped the handle, my heart hammering against my ribs. Behind me, the rattling grew louder, more urgent, like the staff were seconds away from breaking through. I swallowed hard and pulled the door open, stepping into the unknown with nothing but a whispered prayer.		

**Chapter 11**

**Ante Up**

I slammed the door behind me, chest heaving and hands shaking. I thought for sure someone would break down the door, and the staff would be on me any minute. But as the seconds came and went, I was met with nothing. Nothing but the sounds emanating from the new room I found myself in. It was dark. Perfect for hiding out until I could come up with a new plan. My legs felt like gelatin, and I wanted nothing more than to climb into my bed. I wobbled over to an unoccupied seat, barely able to register my surroundings, and flopped face-first onto the bench. The second I closed my eyes, consciousness left me, and I entered a deep, dreamless sleep.

**\*\*\***

""Hey, you!""

My heart leaped into my throat, and I jumped up from my slumber. I've been caught, I thought to myself. My eyes, still not adjusted from waking, couldn't quite make out the imposing figure in front of me. I stammered incoherently, madly rubbing my eyes to assess my surroundings. What stood in front of me, however, wasn't at all who I expected. It was, in fact, vaguely familiar.

""You gonna stand there and gawk at me, or you gonna let me bye? And why were you sleeping on my bag?"" The giant of a man asked, brows furrowed.

""I, uh,..."" I tried to form a coherent sentence, but the words wouldn't form.

""You uh? The fuck does that mean, you uh?""

""S...sorry, I didn't know this was yours. You're not with the staff?"" I asked, holding on to hope.

""What? No. But if I catch you messing with my shit again, you'll wish I was.""

""Again, I'm sorry. I didn't know this was yours."" I held out my hand in an attempt to smooth things over. ""My name is...""

""I don't care what your name is."" He interrupted. ""Just leave me alone. Go bother someone else.""

Perplexed and embarrassed, my cheeks turned a rosy red, and I stood there in stunned silence for a moment. I regained my bearings and, with a forced grin, walked past him. I was relieved he wasn't part of the staff, but his face, I could have sworn I had seen this man before. He had a sharp jawline like one carved from granite. His muscle definition put the Greek gods to shame, but for the life of me, I just couldn't place him.

Trying to shake off the unsettling encounter, I walked toward the front of the cabin. It was much larger than the last. It was colorful but dingy. The room was filled with the acrid stench of old cigarettes and the cacophonous sound of a casino. There had to be at least three hundred people in here, all of them glued to one game of chance or another. There were slot machines, card tables, roulette tables, and any other form of gambling you could think of. To call it overwhelming was an understatement.

My stomach rumbled, interrupting my train of thought, reminding me I had barely eaten the last few days. I neared the buffet, hoping to eat my fil,l but what lay before me was unappetizing, to say the least. The food looked like it had been sitting out for a day or two, yet my stomach groaned again, telling me I had little choice.

I grabbed what passed as food here and settled into a vacant seat, this time making sure there were no one's belongings around me. The pancakes I had tasted like cardboard, and the coffee like motor oil. Regardless, I scarfed them down with reckless abandon. As I ate, I glanced around the room and realized I was the only one not engrossed in a game.

The passengers' gaunt faces and glazed eyes gave the eerie impression they'd melded into the machines themselves. I watched the bizarre scene for some time, a sea of people going through the motions. A shiver ran down my spine as a grown man began blubbering in anguished sobs while his feeble arm reached for the lever.

Alarm bells began ringing in my head, begging me to run back to where I came from. But my mission still needed to be completed. No matter what, I needed to find Chris and Misty. I set my dishes down and straightened my clothes. It was time to ask around.

I walked toward a row of slot machines. Their garish lights flashed brightly, and their deafening chimes pounded relentlessly against my eardrums. A line of passengers sat quietly, playing their games. I was desperate to ask around but wary of drawing attention. I needed to blend in. Hesitantly, I fished a handful of coins from my pocket and inserted them into the machine. The lights flashed in a nauseating pattern before landing on two bells and a cherry. A lifeless synthetic voice emanated from the machine, saying, ""You lose. Try again."" I had never gambled before. All throughout my childhood, my father told me it was a ""sucker's game"" and that I should stay away from it. I had always taken his word for it, but something about this machine was drawing me in.

Focus! My brain screamed, snapping me out of the game's trance. I stuffed the coins in my hand back in my pocket and glanced at the pale, ghoulish old woman beside me. A cigarette smoldering in one hand while the other gripped the slot machine lever with a death-like clutch. Her stony expression and deep-set wrinkles spoke of countless hours wasted. My pulse quickened. I needed to ask her about Chris and Misty, but words felt lodged in my throat. Before I could rein in my nerves, I blurted, ""You look really old, you must have been here for a while."" The words spilled out, raw and clumsy. My face flushed beet red as I reflexively covered my mouth, mortified. I couldn't believe I just said that.

""I...I'm so sorry, I...I didn't mean that. What I meant to say was..."" I trailed off. The woman hadn't moved, hadn't acknowledged my existence, let alone my unintentional insult. She just sat there, staring at the slot machine, mouth agape, eyes glazed over. ""M...Mam?"" I took a step toward her...nothing. I raised my hand and waved it in front of her. Without warning, she jerked the lever in her hand, causing me to jump back reflexively. A yelp escaped my throat as I tripped over my seat into the arms of a passing gambler. I looked up, my embarrassment now cranked up to eleven. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..."" It was the same man from earlier, the same chiseled features glaring at me, thinly veiled annoyance plastered onto his face.

""You again? Why can't you just leave me alone?"" He sighed.

""I didn't mean to fall on you. I was trying to talk to the lady sitting next to me."" I answered, trying to excuse myself. He looked me up and down for a moment and then looked at the woman, still solely focused on her gambling.

""Good luck trying to talk to these people. They aren't the chatty type."" He said dismissively. I stood there confused but still determined to get some information on the whereabouts of my friends. He began to leave. I couldn't let him, not until I had information.

""Have any new people come through here the last few days?"" I blurted out. He stopped in his tracks, back turned, then turned around to face me.

""Why?"" He asked, a dubious expression written on his face.

""They're my friends. They were taken by the staff, and I don't want them to get hurt."" I exclaimed, desperation flowing from my words. His eyes narrowed, and he scoffed, turning his back once again. I raced forward to cut him off. ""Please! They could be in danger!"" I implored.

""Not my problem."" He said blankly, not making eye contact as he strode to his seat. He sat his hulking frame down, fishing coins from his pockets and inserting them into the machine.

""Sir,"" I stammered."" I'm begging you. If you have any information, you could help me save two innocent people's lives.""

""Innocent?"" He mockingly laughed. ""There are no innocent people on the bus.""

""These people are!"" I exclaimed in desperation. ""If you had seen the things I'd seen..."" I trailed off, unsure how much information to reveal. ""I think this bus might be evil,"" I whispered, hoping our conversation went unheard. He turned toward me, an incredulous look woven into every millimeter of his face. When suddenly, he burst into laughter.

""You...you think..."" He could hardly catch his breath in between words. ""The bus might...be evil?"" He bellowed out laughs, loud enough to wake the dead.

""Shhh!"" I exclaimed, lowering my head and scanning my surroundings. ""They'll hear you!"" He turned to the passenger nearest to him and clapped them on the shoulder.

""You hear that? ...said the bus might be evil!"" His laughter was dying down to a hearty chuckle while he wiped a tear from his eye. Mortified, I began looking for an exit to make my escape, when the giant man looked back at me, his amusement dying, and said, ""Quit your worrying. None of them can hear you. Most of the people here are too busy playing their stupid games to care."" My shoulders relaxed, feeling much more at ease yet incredibly unnerved by this revelation.

""Most of them? What about the others?""

""I said quit worrying,"" he repeated, his voice edged with finality, though something in his tone faltered, just for a second. I wanted to argue, to press him for more, but the tension in his posture stopped me cold.

""Can you please help me?"" I begged, my voice barely more than a whisper. At that moment, I felt smaller than ever, just another problem he didn't want to deal with.

For a fleeting moment, his expression softened, the hardness in his eyes giving way to something raw and distant. He looked away, jaw tightening as if trying to force down a thought he didn't want to share.

""I can't help you..."" he muttered, almost too low to hear. Then, louder, ""I can't even help myself."" His eyes darted back to me, now blazing with something sharper, harsher. A warning.

""Just fuck off and leave me alone,"" he snapped, his voice a blade cutting through the uneasy quiet around us.

My blood boiled, and my fists clenched instinctively. What was this guy's problem? I'd risked so much coming here, and all he'd done was treat me like a pest. Standing from my seat, eyes blazing, I stepped forward.

""I don't know who you are or what your deal is, but I'm not leaving without answers,"" I said, my voice steady despite the pounding in my chest. ""I'm risking my life to find my friends, and I won't let some bitter asshole like you stand in my way. So, I'll ask you one last time. Have you seen them?""

A tense moment passed, adrenaline coursing through my veins. He could crush me in an instant, and I braced myself for the inevitable. But I didn't move.

The man stood, his towering frame casting a shadow over me. His eyes burned through mine, searching for something. I swallowed hard, my fists clenched, waiting for the first blow that never came.

""You gonna beat it out of me?"" he finally asked, his voice low and measured.

""No,"" I said, my voice cracking.

A flicker of something, confusion? Curiosity? crossed his face. ""You really don't know who I am?""

""Should I?"" I asked, bewildered. His face tugged at the edge of my memory, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't place him.

""That's a relief,"" he said with a sigh, sitting back down and resuming his gameplay. Unsure how to proceed, I cautiously took the seat next to him.

""You do look familiar,"" I ventured, my brain working overtime to place the man. ""Have we met before?""

""Maybe,"" he muttered, his focus still on the slot machine.

""Wait a second..."" I paused, fragments of a memory scratching at the edges of my mind. A football game on TV, my dad yelling at the screen. That jawline, those shoulders... ""You were on my dad's favorite football team, weren't you?""

He stiffened slightly, his shoulders tensing. He didn't answer, but his silence spoke volumes.

""Yeah, you were!"" I said, growing more certain. ""I'm not really into sports, but I remember Dad talking about you. What was your name? Paul, Phil...""

""Preston,"" he interrupted, his voice low. ""Preston Farrow."" He still wouldn't look at me, his eyes fixed firmly on the machine in front of him.

""That's right, Preston Farrow! My dad talked about you all the time!"" I exclaimed. Then I noticed him shift uncomfortably in his seat, his jaw tightening.

""Let me guess,"" he said, his voice dripping with weary sarcasm. ""Preston's a lazy prima donna. He never should have been drafted and set the team back a decade, right?""

I frowned, surprised by his self-deprecation. ""No, he loved you. He loved the whole team.""

Preston scoffed, shaking his head. ""That's new. Most people just tell me I ruined their childhoods or some shit. Wanna swap dads?""

The question caught me off guard. ""He passed, a few years ago,"" I said quietly, my gaze falling to the floor.

Preston froze for a moment, his lips pursed, and his face remained unreadable. ""I wish I were that lucky,"" he muttered under his breath, his voice like a low growl.

I looked up sharply. ""You don't mean that!""

He leaned back in his chair, his smirk cold and distant. ""Oh, I mean it,"" he said, voice steady but cutting. ""That man was a bastard. Nothing I ever did was good enough for him. Win the game? 'You didn't score enough.' Set a record? 'Must've been a weak year.' Drafted first overall? 'Only because they had no better options.'""

His laugh was bitter, hollow. ""I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat. You got to say goodbye. Me? I'll be happy if I get to spit on his grave."" I sat in my seat, too stunned to speak, my jaw nearly hitting the floor. The weight of his words hung heavy in the air, and for a moment, the only sound was the incessant chime of the slot machines.

I swallowed hard and said, ""Is that why...""

""Why I'm such an asshole?"" he interrupted, still staring at the machine. His tone wasn't angry this time, just tired, as if the words themselves weighed too much to carry.

""N...no,"" I stammered, my voice barely audible. ""I was going to ask if that's why you're here to get away from your dad.""

Preston reached for the lever but stopped, his hand hovering over it. His jaw tightened, and for a long moment, he just stared at the machine, the flashing lights reflecting in his eyes.

""Among other things,"" he said finally, as he pulled the lever and fell back into a slump.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked sympathetically. He perked up from his chair and glared at me.

""Why should I tell you anything?"" His icy blue eyes locked onto mine, sharp and unyielding, like a cornered animal ready to make his escape. The weight of his gaze rooted me in place, my palms clammy and my breath shallow. Time seemed to stretch, the muffled hum of the casino fading into a dull buzz. For a moment, I wondered if I'd pushed too far, poked at something better left buried. But with nothing to lose and everything to gain, I steeled myself and pushed forward just a little bit more.

""Because I don't know you,"" I breathed, my voice barely above a whisper.

He gritted his teeth, the flicker of something unreadable crossing his face. Anger? Pain? I couldn't tell. The space between us crackled like static, and for a moment, I thought he might explode or walk away for good. His eyes darted away, his posture shifting as his shoulders relaxed ever so slightly. A faint, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corners of his lips, though his voice was laced with bitter amusement. ""You got me there."" He crossed his arms, leaned back in his chair, and let out a long sigh. ""So, what do you want to know?""					",1,1751827342.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False
1lt8mfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1lt8mfy/tifu_by_throwing_up_in_my_boyfriends_grandmas/,TIFU by throwing up in my boyfriend‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs bathroom,"Hi redit, it‚Äôs been a while since I was last on here but listening to the smosh redit stories recently has inspired me to post my god awful experience here and hopefully give a few of you a laugh. I will give a little context in saying this wasn‚Äôt today but it wasn‚Äôt like years ago. It was back in the beginning of may (posting in july 2025) So without further ado, today I fucked up by throwing up in my boyfriend‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs bathroom. 

To start this off I‚Äôll say my boyfriend (20m) and I (19f) had been dating for 3-4 months at this time. He‚Äôs always been super patient and understanding with any sort of issues I‚Äôve had medically. I have orthostatic hypotension (basically POTS but different) as well as my antidepressants messing with my stomach when not taken with food. (Yes both of those are important to know for this). We had left my house in the suburbs of chicago around noon the previous day having woken up late and made the 5 1/2 hour drive to his grandma‚Äôs house in Ohio. Now, I always take my meds in the morning, however I had been so
focused while leaving on getting everything in the car and not forgetting anything in the process that i had forgotten to not only eat, but also take them. Missing them for one day will not significantly impact my mood seeing as they build over time in my system so emotionally I was fine and didn‚Äôt even notice. We eventually got to the house and settled into the guest room, went out for pizza with his grandma, and fell asleep knowing we had some things planned for the following night at one of his friends houses. However at about 5:30 in the morning i shot up in a panic realizing i never took my meds the previous day. I tried to lay down and wait for my boyfriend to wake up so we could get food and I could take them but he sleeps till noon if
given the option. So after laying there debating for a while i took them at about 8:30am. Did i know i would need food in the next half hour before i felt disgusting? Yes. Did i still have some insane belief that i would be fine? Absolutely. And well my friends, it only took half an hour to begin to feel a little nauseous. As the feeling sets in i turned to my boyfriend and tried my best to wake him, now he‚Äôs a very light sleeper, but he‚Äôs also very exhausted when waking up and falls back asleep in an instant if i don‚Äôt physically get him out of the bed. So long story short, we didn‚Äôt end up loading into the car till 9:45 to go get food for me because nothing in the house sounded appealing at the moment.

Eventually we are able to get to the starbucks drive through about 10 minutes away. I am practically sweating through my clothes at this point and staring out the window keeping my mouth shut tight trying not to make a mess in his car. He hands me my chocolate croissant and my coffee and the feeling only gets worse. I tell him to drive back to the house as fast as he can without getting us pulled over and he does meanwhile i‚Äôm gripping my seat and the door like it‚Äôs gonna magically stop me from feeling like everything i HAVENT eaten in the last 12 hours is coming back up. Meanwhile my boyfriend is in the drivers seat trying his best to console me. When we finally get to his grandma‚Äôs house once again i lay down in the bedroom and stare at the ceiling trying to keep the world from spinning, he sets my coffee in the fridge knowing i probably won‚Äôt drink it for a while, and runs his fingers through my hair trying to get me back to normal. That only works for about 10 minutes before i shoot out of the bed and into the bathroom. My hand is over my mouth trying to keep everything in till i can reach the toilet but i fall short about 3 feet. i end up dropping to my knees and crawling to the toilet gripping the edges and praying for it to be over. Now some of you might be wondering, why isn‚Äôt he helping you? where‚Äôs him pulling your hair out of your face? and you would be correct. he stayed in the bedroom because he knows if he helps me he will be in even worse shape than me and no one wants that. I‚Äôm in there for about 15 minutes before my boyfriend texts me asking if he should come help and risk it, and i told him not to since i didn‚Äôt want him to throw up as well. However, about 30 seconds after sending that text a final large wave of nausea came and i threw up everything left in my body, my abs felt like they were on fire and my stomach was squeezing in on itself so hard‚Ä¶i shat. Yes that‚Äôs right, i shat myself while throwing up in his grandmother‚Äôs bathroom while sobbing and trying to wipe up the parts that missed the toilet. Even worse, his grandma had removable little carpet pieces in the bathroom covering majority of the tile, not only was there now
vomit in that, but also a large shit stain from the liquid, YES LIQUID! That had just shot out of my ass. I kinda just sat there quietly for a minute trying to contemplate what was happening but i ended up just taking the pants and underwear all the way off and setting it to the side before curling up in the corner and texting my boyfriend to come help because i had no idea what to do. Luckily he‚Äôs a trooper and he sprung into action washing my pants and bringing me my toiletries so i could shower. I hop in the shower and immediately my heart starts beating uncontrollably fast to the point of where i thought i was going to
die. I end up collapsing in the shower because of the heat and almost passing out because my orthostatic hypotension tends to
make me dizzy and light headed when in extreme heat, and i unfortunately like to basically boil myself in my showers. So obviously that didn‚Äôt quite end up making things any better. I end up taking a whole 2 hours trying to get back into the bedroom and from there on my boyfriend would not stop talking about it and making jokes. We did end up going to our plans later that night but not until after he made me get a smoothie down and telling all his friends about the story. Also now his grandma thinks i have severe bowel issues of which she would not stop checking in on the entire trip which was even more
embarrassing.

TL;DR today i fucked up by throwing up and shitting on my boyfriend‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs carpet, and now everyone knows and won‚Äôt stop making jokes.",14,1751827307.0,tifu,5,0.67,False

As the main focus is to try different and experimental coffees, we need a sampler roaster that can make a nice and quick job roasting, only to cup a wide range of coffee often.

Im stuck on the fence on my hardest least motivated days... Is it better to train with less motivation, or drink caffeine and maximize output?

## Chapter 1: The Weight of Silence:

The dogs died.Every last one.Not just animals, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers ‚Äî beings who never barked or bit, only understood.

When they were gone, it felt like the universe itself lost a breath. I carried that loss inside me like a stone in my chest.

My mother had fire in her eyes ‚Äî not calm, but fierce. She didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it. ‚ÄúThis is the way it is,‚Äù she said once, voice sharp as broken glass. **‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe me, go fucking find out.‚Äù**
No comfort. No softness. Just raw truth. For her ‚Äî and for me ‚Äî depression wasn‚Äôt sadness.
It was hopelessness.
Not because I doubted the future. I knew, deep down, that things would get better. Far beyond my time, the stars would shine brighter. Life would flourish. But knowing that didn‚Äôt help. It was hard to build energy on a future I can't immediately touch.

Maybe I‚Äôd just kill myself‚Ä¶ hibernate a little while before reincarnation. Wait for the Universe to catch up.
Mom tried shooting herself when I was little. It only made her more scary. A .45 lodged in her cerebellum didn‚Äôt do suit, but give her a mythos.

The present felt wrong, a vast clusterfuck that swallowed meaning whole. I closed my eyes: grief, anger, sadness, and knowledge of a greater stage being set, for future for everyone simultaneously converged into 100 different perceptions of myself. And then‚Äîsomething broke open.

A fracture in time and space appeared, glowing faint and sharp. Paths to slip through.
This is new...

**Dogs... My Shadow**

Back home, we lived with them‚Äînot as pets, but as partners, teachers, comedians, healers. They didn‚Äôt bark. They didn‚Äôt bite.
They understood.

I perceived myself in an alley behind a bakery in Lincolnshire, 17th century Earth.
My perceptions converged into 1.
No one noticed but the dog.The Dog?!?
The dog looked at me.
Not past me. Not through me. At me.
My tail started wagging.
(Metaphorically. Not innuendosly... yet.)

She was a street mutt, a professional beggar, and swindler of hearts. I threw my arms around her and spoke in twelve frequencies of puppy voice. She smelled like **bread and static.** I made every facial expression. Ever.

That‚Äôs when Isaac Newton saw me.
He stood at the edge of the alley holding a satchel full of lemons and ink-stained papers. His wig was crooked. His pupils were wide. He watched me kiss the dog, dance, and repeat *'Who's a fucking good girl?""* A million times. **He's a voyer. I'll soon learn it's an English kink. So is dressing up in regalia and threatening violence... weird as fucks.** **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here,‚Äù** he said, flatly. I blinked, ears twitching. **‚ÄúHere is relative.‚Äù** He smirked.
*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been awake for... days?‚Äù* he said, **‚ÄúI've been feeling like the weight of the world has been holding me down lately, so I retaliate by working on perfecting my tincture. I hallucinated an angel yesterday. I named her Hypothesis.‚Äù** He knelt down and scratched the dog behind her ear. She sneezed.
**‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he said, staring at me now, **‚Äúare either a messenger or a maniac. I remember you from my vision I will have in the future.‚Äù**
*""This man knows how to phase-lock...""* I thought to myself.
His nose, eyes, and autonomous identity reminded me of a childhood friend... **""Don't bring up the past.""** I jestered.
**And so I did.**

He Invited me to Woolsthorpe Manor, a crooked house full of books, mercury, dried herbs, unwashed cups, and dreams that smelled like fire.

## Chapter 3: Fucking Wizards:
I came to Earth to find dogs.
Instead I found a wizard high on theology , opium, sassafras bark, roots, fungi, and a synthetic caffeinoid with enough benzyne rings to cause another Big Bang.
He didn‚Äôt ask me where I came from.
Only why I hadn‚Äôt sooner.
If I would‚Äôve known my capability, and the stimulants awaiting for me, I would have.

So, yeah. I found the Canid genome I yearned for. Except it wasn't a Canid, or a genome. It was the fucking will, the want, the direction, and the strategy of an attrition specialist.
Newton called it **‚ÄúThe Solution.‚Äù**
I called it a goddamn rapture in a bottle.

I was caught off guard by the gravity of the effect on me. Suicide disappeared as an option. Ideas of fixing, defining, and writing music about all that was will and could be became my self appointed purpose. Granted by the divine right of fiends. I see all patterns like a **polymath(a word for someone with no education of formulas, so they articulate with what they are familiar with)** An abstract thinker who articulates with geometric-trigenometry without knowledge of Hilbert, or Vector spaces. E.g. me. **""Orthogonal?"" ""Sine wave from A to B, you mean."" ""Koche Vector?"" ""You mean Tangent X pi.""**
Newton and I claimed ourselves the greatest mathematical visionists. I defined a solitonic wave bottlenecking down a trunctuating canal that becomes a spout. I explained how intuitive it was to see the solitons layered kinetic energy exiting the spout way faster than brute pressure would. Then he explained to me in words not yet invented, how a bucket full of water, swung in a circle described everything if you measure the volume, weight, speed, and arc.

He told me it was to ‚Äúcalibrate perception.‚Äù
That‚Äôs wizard-speak for: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get high and talk about numbers, and patterns until we have to use letters. ‚Äù

And it worked.

We sat up night after night, cracked out on enlightenment, discussing whether time was a function of emergence, information, relation, or imagination. We were deep in contemplation.

## Chapter 4: The Heathens:

I woke up in a mud-slick field outside of Yorkshire. Ivar the Boneless drawing boundaries with a string. The Anglos realizing they've been tricked by words, but they honor their word anyway. This is definitely *pre-Agincourt.*
Leather, wool, axes, and fucking huge bows!?! Who made those bows so big and why? Look at the shoulders on the archers! Jesus Christ!
Look at the shoulders of the Danes!
People evolve fast to rowing and bowing apparently.
They are all nervous. **ALL OF THEM.** Factions on both sides are planning on attacking their current allies when this war is over. They are all pole positioning. If they don't, they don't stand a chance in this cutthroat catwalk.
The mud sucked at my boots, cold and greedy, as I stood in the Yorkshire field. Ivar the Boneless was still there, pacing with his string, marking boundaries like a spider weaving a web. His eyes glinted, not with malice but with hunger‚Äîa hunger for control, for legacy, for something to outlast the blood about to soak this earth. The Anglo archers, their shoulders carved from years of pulling monstrous bows, eyed the Danes with a mix of respect and dread. The Danes, broad as oaks, gripped axes and shields, their breaths steaming in the dawn chill. Everyone was posturing, planning betrayals before the first arrow flew.I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Or maybe I was. The fracture in time‚Äîthat faint, sharp glow I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîpulsed in the corner of my vision, a crack in the world‚Äôs skin. The dog was gone, but her scent lingered, **bread and static,** tethering me to something real. I closed my eyes, and the hundred perceptions of myself flickered: Osiris, Lucifer, Jesus, the street mutt, Newton‚Äôs angel Hypothesis, and now‚Ä¶ what? A witness? A warrior? A ghost?Ivar noticed me. His limp was pronounced, but his presence was a blade, cutting through the fog. **‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he rasped, pointing with a calloused finger. **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no Anglo. No Dane. What are you, skald, to stand here unmarked?‚Äù** I smirked, echoing Newton‚Äôs crooked grin from centuries later. **‚ÄúHere is relative,‚Äù** I said. His laugh was a bark, short and sharp, like the dogs I‚Äôd lost.‚ÄúYou speak in riddles,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. **‚ÄúGood. Riddles keep men alive when steel fails.‚Äù** He handed me the string he‚Äôd been using to mark the field. It was coarse, stained with dirt and blood. **‚ÄúMeasure the world, stranger. Tell me what you see.‚Äù** I took the string, feeling its weight‚Äînot just physical, but something heavier, like the stone in my chest after the dogs died. I stretched it taut, mimicking his movements, and the battlefield seemed to shift. The lines I drew weren‚Äôt just boundaries; they were equations, patterns, the same solitonic waves I‚Äôd described to Newton. The archers‚Äô bows, the Danes‚Äô axes, the nervous glances‚Äîthey were all vectors, forces, arcs of intent spiraling toward collision. **‚ÄúWar‚Äôs a function,‚Äù I muttered, half to Ivar, half to myself. ‚ÄúMass looking for a mirror.‚Äù** He squinted, not understanding but intrigued. **‚ÄúYou sound like a sei√∞ma√∞r, a sorcerer. Speak plain, or I‚Äôll gut you.‚Äù** I laughed, reckless. **‚ÄúGravity‚Äôs empathy, Ivar. You pull men to you, and they pull back. Betrayal‚Äôs just the reflection of trust. Same shit, different lingo.‚Äù** His grin was feral now. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do, stranger. Stay close. The bows will sing soon, and I want your eyes on the slaughter.‚Äù* The fracture glowed brighter, and I felt it calling. Not just a crack, but a door. I could slip through, back to Newton‚Äôs manor, back to the dogs, forward to a future where the stars burned brighter. But I stayed. The mud, the string, the weight of Ivar‚Äôs gaze‚Äîthey grounded me. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave this moment, this convergence of chaos and clarity.The first arrow flew, a high whine cutting the air. The bowstring‚Äôs song was a soliton, a wave carrying kinetic energy faster than brute force. I saw it all: the arc, the speed, the volume of death in motion.
Ivar made his way to me. **""Glory is yours to take. You are wise enough to lead a flank up the hill, so we can go back and cut around their backs. We're leaving a skeleton crew to hit and run to fake a full army. Valhalla is calling your name.""**
I couldn't hold the stoic expression. *""Fuck you Dickless!""* I grabbed his head and forced my knee into it. He had a hard head, and was vaccinated against headblows.
He knew exactly why I did it. And he didn't try to deny leading me as bait to draw all of his enemies to kill each other without him lifting a finger. **Odysseus of Ragnorok.**

## Chapter 5: Einstein‚Äôs Kitchen and Other Drug-Fueled Mysteries of the Cosmos:

The fracture in time spat me out into a cramped Munich kitchen, 1905, the air thick with the tang of burnt coffee and something sharper **Pervitin** **methamphetamine** buzz humming through Albert Einstein‚Äôs veins like a cosmic telegraph. The room was a chaos of domesticity and madness: chipped porcelain cups stacked in a sink, a half-eaten loaf of rye bread on a scarred wooden table, papers scrawled with equations spilling onto the floor like a drunk‚Äôs confession. A gas lamp flickered, casting shadows that danced like the equations themselves, curling and bending in defiance of Euclidean order. Einstein paced, his hair already a wild halo, his shirt untucked, eyes wide with the manic glow of a man who‚Äôd seen the universe‚Äôs blueprint and couldn‚Äôt unsee it.His wife, Mileva Mariƒá, stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes with a ferocity that could‚Äôve scoured the stars. Her dark hair was pinned up, but strands escaped, framing a face tight with exhaustion. **‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have the space or the time to do this,‚Äù** she muttered, her voice a low blade, cutting through the clatter of porcelain. I froze, leaning against a wall that smelled of damp plaster and regret. *‚ÄúDid you just‚Äî?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she snapped, not looking up. ‚ÄúI fucking did.‚Äù* Her words were a spark in the haze, a reminder that even in 1905, the human condition was raw, unfiltered, pissed off. Mileva wasn‚Äôt just washing dishes‚Äîshe was washing away the weight of being Einstein‚Äôs shadow, the mathematician whose own brilliance was buried under his. I felt it, the stone in my chest, the same one I carried since the dogs died. She was me, too‚Äîtrapped in a role she didn‚Äôt choose, raging against a world that didn‚Äôt see her.Einstein didn‚Äôt laugh at her outburst. He was too deep in his own orbit, pacing a groove into the linoleum, muttering about spacetime like it was a lover who‚Äôd betrayed him. He clutched a vial of Pervitin tablets, popping another like it was candy, his fingers trembling with the chemical courage that fueled his annus mirabilis. *‚ÄúSpacetime curves because it feels,‚Äù* he said, half to me, half to the void. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not math‚Äîit‚Äôs emotion, stretched across infinity.‚ÄùI smirked, my head throbbing with a concussion like pulse, the fracture‚Äôs glow flickering in the corner of my vision. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying the universe is depressed?‚Äù* He stopped, looked at me‚Äîreally looked, like the dog in Lincolnshire had, not past me but at me. **‚ÄúDepression‚Äôs just truth with no place to go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGenius is just depression with a better PR team.‚ÄùI nodded, the stone in my chest shifting. ‚ÄúYeah. Or finding a formula that describes all of existence, but your own.‚Äù** I knew that formula‚Äîmine, from the dogs‚Äô death, from my mother‚Äôs fire-eyes and her .45 mythos; his, from wrestling a universe that refused to stay still. We were both psychonauts, high on our own damage, chasing truths that burned.We sat at the table, the rye bread between us like a sacrament. Mileva kept scrubbing, her silence louder than the equations. I told Einstein about the dogs‚Äînot pets, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers. How their absence was a hole in the cosmos, a loss that made the stars dim. He listened, his Pervitin-sharpened eyes softening, and told me about his son, Hans Albert, barely a year old, sleeping in the next room. ‚ÄúI see him, and I see time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot clocks, but‚Ä¶ weight. The weight of what I‚Äôll leave him.‚ÄùI thought of my mother, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** Einstein‚Äôs weight was hers, mine, the dogs‚Äô. It was the weight of knowing too much and feeling too little, of being unbearably conscious in a world that demanded blindness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired of being called a genius,‚Äù I said, not a question.He laughed, and analyzed. *‚ÄúGenius is a cage. They‚Äôll build bombs with my math, you know. They‚Äôll call it progress.‚Äù* His words hit like a shell in the trenches I‚Äôd seen, where patriotism justified fratricide. **The Royal Scam was already forming‚ÄîEinstein‚Äôs drug-fueled revelations would become relativity, then atomic bombs, then a world???**

## Chapter 6: Paradoxes and Psychonauts: (Expanded Transition)

The kitchen blurred, the fracture pulling me deeper into the haze. Einstein and I ranted, our words spilling like his papers, chaotic and true. We tweaked on Pervitin‚Äôs edge, the drug sharpening our edges until we were knives cutting through reality. Einstein leaned back, his chair creaking, and said, ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs a loaf of bread. I live in the slice labeled 1905, but I feel crumbs from all of it‚Äîpast, future, all at once.‚Äù **I asked if God played dice. He grinned, eyes glinting like the fracture. ‚ÄúMaybe. But He loads them.‚Äù** We laughed, then cried, tears hot with the weight of knowing the universe was a rigged game. We popped more Pervitin, recited Rilke‚Äôs Duino Elegies‚Äîlines about angels and terror‚Äîuntil we forgot what species we were, what century we were in

## Chapter 7: God, King, and Country:

The bowstring‚Äôs song faded, replaced by a wet, choking stench‚Äîtrenches, 1916, somewhere near the Somme. The air was thick with cordite and fear-sweat, **the kind that makes men kill their own before the enemy gets a chance**. I stumbled through the muck, boots sinking. The fracture in time had spit me out here, and the glowing crack in reality pulsed behind me, a taunting exit I couldn‚Äôt take. Not yet.The trench was a scar in the earth, jagged and festering. Soldiers huddled, their eyes hollow, rifles trembling in hands that hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Fear wasn‚Äôt just a feeling here‚Äîit was a currency, traded in glances, in the twitch of a trigger finger. A private, barely 19, was whispering to himself, clutching a rosary like it could stop a bullet. *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs with us,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúKing and country.‚Äù* His mate, older, face caked in mud, laughed bitterly. **‚ÄúGod‚Äôs on leave, mate. And the king‚Äôs in a palace, not this shithole.‚Äù** I saw it before it happened. The private‚Äôs eyes darted to his mate, not with camaraderie but with terror‚Äîterror that the man next to him might crack, might turn the rifle inward. **Fratricide wasn‚Äôt a word here; it was a *reflex.* More men died in these trenches from their own side‚Äôs panic than from German shells.** A scream cut through the fog **someone had snapped, bayoneted his sergeant** for ordering another charge over the top. The officer‚Äôs blood mixed with the mud, and no one blinked. Patriotism? It was a fairy tale they told themselves to keep from eating their guns.I crouched, my head pounding harder now, the stone in my chest heavier. The dogs were gone, but their absence was louder than the artillery. They‚Äôd have known this was all bullshit‚Äîking, country, the whole scam. Dogs don‚Äôt salute flags or die for ideals. They just are. I envied them.

## Chapter 8: Project Sunshine:

The fracture flickered, and the trench dissolved. I was standing in San Francisco, 1950s, the air sharp with ocean salt and something else‚Äîsomething metallic, invisible, coating the streets like a ghost.
**Project Sunshine**
 The name sounded like a promise, but it was a lie. The government was dusting the city with radioactive particles, spraying **strontium-90 and cesium-137** to see how it spread, how it settled in lungs, in bones. Innocent people, kids eating ice cream, workers hauling crates‚Äîthey were all lab rats, and they didn‚Äôt even know it.I saw a woman in a diner, spooning oatmeal to her toddler. **Quaker Oats, laced with radioactive **calcium-45**, part of the same sick experiment
 The kid giggled, oblivious, as the mother smiled, proud of her all-American breakfast. I wanted to scream, to knock the bowl out of her hands, but my voice was gone. I was a ghost here, too, just like the radiation. The Royal Scam was in full swing: the government, waving the flag of progress, poisoned its own to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them from the Red Menace. Patriotism was a mask, and behind it, the war machine chewed through its own people.I thought of my mother, her fire-eyes, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** She‚Äôd have seen through this, too. She‚Äôd have burned the diner down before letting that kid eat another bite. But me?

## Chapter 9: The Snowden Loop:

The fracture yanked me again, and now I was in a server room, 2013, the hum of machines drowning out the world. Edward Snowden sat at a terminal, his fingers flying, leaking secrets that‚Äôd make the world scream. I wasn‚Äôt just watching him‚ÄîI was him. My hands were his, my paranoia his, my certainty that the truth was worth the exile. The NSA, the CIA, the whole alphabet soup of power‚Äîthey were the modern royalty, dressed in suits instead of crowns, claiming authority because they controlled the data, the narrative, the scam.But it wasn‚Äôt just them. It was Newton, codifying gravity while high as a kite, then preaching sober science. It was Ivar, drawing lines in the mud to claim victory, then betraying his allies. It was the generals in the trenches, sending boys to die for a flag they‚Äôd never touch. Every era, the same con: get to the truth first, bottle it, sell it, ban it.

## Chapter 10: Transmission Over:

**The dogs knew**. They always knew. That‚Äôs why they had to die.I stumbled out of Snowden‚Äôs body, my head... screaming! What the fuck is this? Every character, every moment, I was the private in the trench, killing his sergeant out of fear. I was the mother feeding her kid poisoned oatmeal, believing in the American Dream. I was Newton, chasing enlightenment in a haze of mercury. I was Ivar, plotting betrayal with a string. I was Snowden, burning my life to expose the truth. ~[ I was robbing a bank when I took a bullet to the skull.]~

### The bank‚Äôs alarms wailed.
 ~[ Blood in my face, stuck to my head, filling my mouth, left ear, and nostrils. I lost the choke and gag reflex. I lost all reflex.]~ I was dipping my head in warm bath water, getting cleaned up before I go lay down. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about civilization, and the archetypes it fosters. All while muttering ""Can‚Äôt they see the hypocrisy? How could they be unaware of the damage they are causing?""

The dogs were gone, but I could still smell bread and static... and copper.

1lt8dll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dissociation/comments/1lt8dll/could_this_have_been_dissociation_i_need_help/,Could this have been dissociation? I need help understanding.,"(Reposting for better wording) 

Hi everyone,
I'm reaching out here to better understand something that's been tearing me apart. My partner (29M) of 7 and a half years, has a long history of mental health struggles, and something happened in our relationship that I‚Äôm trying to process and understand through the lens of possible dissociation. I'm hoping someone can help shed light on whether this may have been a dissociative episode.

Context:
He has dealt with severe sleep deprivation since childhood (would drink energy drinks/coffee to stay up around 10-13+ because sleep never worked out), due to undiagnosed sleep apnea (recently diagnosed about 5 months ago and now treated with CPAP because we didn't know until recently about all of his diagnosis). He's experienced things like hearing voices (especially at night), self-harm, self-hatred, emotional numbness, out-of-body feelings, memory loss, long-standing clinical depression, anxiety, critically low Vitamin D (level 9), and suicidal ideation all as young as 6 years old from what he remembers. His first time trying to take his life was at 14. He‚Äôs also suspected to have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) after he was recently Baker Acted after becoming suicidal following a major confession (cheating). 

For the past year and a half, he‚Äôs also been using weed daily, heavily, especially during a time where he was spiraling badly. He said he felt like he was, ""not there/himself."" He recalls very little from the last two years, saying things feel blurry or missing entirely. He also has memory gaps during periods of high stress and emotional overwhelm. He often has no recollection of his angry outbursts during or after. Anger was his main driving emotion due to feeling exhausted all day.

The event:
About a year and a half ago, he engaged in behavior that deeply hurt me. A girl he vaguely knew sent him around 3 unsolicited nudes on Snapchat over the course of like 3 months. They didn't really talk, other than her expressing her being suicidal. He said he flipped through them without really looking and left generic pity comments because she said she was suicidal given all her history she told me. Then, she asked for a photo from him‚Äîand he recalls sending a half assed photo of his random boner and that he recalls being unable to keep up. He told me recently (after getting better sleep and stopping daily weed use) and says he doesn‚Äôt understand why he did it. He says he didn‚Äôt feel anything, didn‚Äôt want anything, and wasn‚Äôt turned on‚Äîhe describes it as something that felt like taking a photo of his hand or arm at the time. He didn‚Äôt even hide to take it or try to be secretive‚Äîhe just did it. He doesn‚Äôt remember the details of the photos, just the vague act of it and the feeling.

After coming out of what he describes as a fog/snapped out of it, he says it hit him all at once and he immediately wanted to end his life due to guilt and shame. Like, ""What have I done?"", he did not try to justify it. He told me everything he remembers from the fragments, told his friends and family, and has been full of guilt and self-hatred. He cries constantly, says he can‚Äôt enjoy life anymore, and doesn't feel he deserves anything good. He keeps saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I did it‚ÄîI hate cheaters. I‚Äôve been cheated on. I wasn‚Äôt myself and that angers me so much, because I don't understand why I did it. It felt like I wasn't there. I was numb to everything."" 

Why I'm here:
I‚Äôve seen people say, ‚ÄúDissociation isn‚Äôt an excuse,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúYou always have full control.‚Äù But I‚Äôve also read stories where dissociation involves memory loss, robotic behaviors, acting out of character, or emotional detachment during serious decisions.

Could this truly have been dissociation?
Could someone send a photo like that‚Äînot out of lust or attraction‚Äîbut in a completely numb, disconnected state?
Is it possible he was dissociated and still responsible‚Äîbut not, ""conscious?"" 

I‚Äôm not trying to excuse it. I‚Äôm trying to understand it. I‚Äôm shattered by what happened, but I want to understand what was going on in his mind and body. He didn‚Äôt just not tell me‚Äîhe hated himself for it, almost died from the shame, and still says he doesn‚Äôt know who that person was. He says it's difficult to even go on, that he should've got help when I suggested it, but was too overwhelmed with the feeling of doom and the thought of it'll never change him before this spiral happened. He said if he knew it would've been like this, he would've got help so long ago.

1lt8csd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OzempicWiki/comments/1lt8csd/is_ozempic_not_working_for_you_dont_give_up_yet/,Is Ozempic Not Working For You? Don't Give Up Yet!,"Track Your GLP-1 Journey With The [GLP-1 LOG IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glp-1-log-injections-tracker/id6747810242?platform=iphone)


You had high hopes for Ozempic, didn't you? Maybe you envisioned steady weight loss, a quieter appetite, and just generally feeling better. And now- you're feeling a bit stuck. Perhaps the scale hasn't budged, or those cravings are still screaming your name. It's frustrating, I know. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it certainly doesn't mean you've failed.

Here's what I've learned from my own journey and from talking to so many others: Ozempic is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic wand. Sometimes, it needs a little help, or maybe you just need a clearer picture of what's really happening. Let's dive into what to do when Ozempic seems to be taking a coffee break.

**What ""Not Working"" Really Looks Like**

Before we troubleshoot, let's define what ""not working"" might mean for you. It's rarely a simple on-off switch.

- **The Scale Isn't Moving:** This is often the first thing people notice. You're consistent with your injections, but the numbers on the scale aren't budging, or they've plateaued for a while.
- **Your Appetite Isn't Suppressed:** Maybe you're still feeling hungry all the time, or the ""food noise"" in your head is just as loud as ever. Cravings can still hit hard, making it tough to stick to your goals.
- **Side Effects Are Still Overwhelming:** While this is a different topic, if side effects are so severe that you can't adhere to the medication or lifestyle changes, it definitely feels like it's ""not working"" for your quality of life.
- **Blood Sugar Isn't Improving:** For those using Ozempic for blood sugar management, a lack of progress in your A1C or daily readings can be a major concern.

It's important to pinpoint what *your* specific concern is, because that helps guide the next steps.

**Common Reasons Ozempic Might Seem Stuck**

If you're feeling like Ozempic isn't pulling its weight, it's often due to one of a few common factors. It's rarely the medication completely failing, but rather a piece of the puzzle that needs adjusting.

**You're Not at the Optimal Dose (Yet!)**

This is probably the most common reason. Ozempic isn't a one-size-fits-all medication, and it's designed to be slowly titrated up.

- **The Slow Ramp-Up:** Your doctor starts you on a low dose to help your body adjust and minimize side effects. This initial dose often isn't the one where you'll see the full effects.
- **Finding Your ""Sweet Spot"":** Many people don't experience significant appetite suppression or weight loss until they reach higher doses, like 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, or even 2.4 mg. Your body needs time to adapt and for the medication to build up in your system.
- **Patience is Key:** It can take weeks, or even a few months, to get to the dose that truly works for you.

**You Haven't Given It Enough Time**

We live in a world of instant gratification, but Ozempic isn't that.

- **It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint:** Weight loss and metabolic changes take time. Don't expect dramatic results overnight or even in just a few weeks.
- **Plateaus Happen:** Even when it *is* working, you'll likely hit plateaus. This is normal for any weight loss journey, and it's a sign your body is adjusting, not necessarily failing.

**Your Lifestyle Needs a Tune-Up**

Ozempic is a powerful *aid*, but it's not a magic wand that overrides everything else. It helps you eat less, but it doesn't choose *what* you eat.

- **Nutrition Matters (Still!):**
 - **Food Quality:** Are you still relying on highly processed foods, sugary drinks, or large portions of unhealthy meals? Ozempic helps with quantity, but quality still counts for satiety, nutrients, and overall health.
 - **Protein and Fiber:** These are your best friends. They keep you full and satisfied, which complements Ozempic's effects.
 - **Hydration:** Dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger.
- **Movement is Crucial:**
 - **Consistency:** Regular physical activity helps burn calories, build muscle (which boosts metabolism), and improves overall well-being.
 - **Beyond the Gym:** It doesn't have to be intense workouts. Walking, gardening, or taking the stairs all count.
- **Sleep and Stress Management:**
 - **Sleep Deprivation:** Can mess with your hunger hormones (ghrelin and leptin), making you feel hungrier and crave unhealthy foods.
 - **Stress:** Chronic stress can lead to increased cortisol, which can promote fat storage, especially around the belly. It also often leads to emotional eating.

**Unrealistic Expectations**

It's easy to see dramatic success stories online and think that's the norm.

- **Individual Response Varies:** Everyone's body responds differently. Some people experience significant weight loss, while others have more moderate results. Both are valid and beneficial!
- **Focus on Non-Scale Victories:** Are your clothes fitting better? Do you have more energy? Is your blood sugar more stable? These are huge wins that the scale might not capture.

**Other Factors at Play**

Sometimes, there are underlying medical reasons that could be impacting your progress.

- **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Undiagnosed or poorly managed conditions like thyroid issues, PCOS, or other hormonal imbalances can make weight loss incredibly challenging, even with medication.
- **Other Medications:** Some medications can cause weight gain or interfere with metabolism, counteracting Ozempic's effects.

**Your Action Plan: What to Do Next**

Feeling stuck doesn't mean it's over. Here's a clear, actionable plan to get back on track.

**Talk to Your Doctor - This is Priority One**

Seriously, don't try to figure this out alone. Your healthcare provider is your best resource.

- **Review Your Dose and Timeline:** Discuss where you are in your titration schedule. Ask if it's time to increase your dose or if you've been on a particular dose long enough to assess its full effect.
- **Discuss Your Goals and Progress:** Be honest about what you're experiencing. Are you not losing weight? Still hungry? Are side effects too much?
- **Explore Other Health Factors:**
 - Ask about screening for any **underlying medical conditions** that might be hindering progress (like thyroid issues).
 - Review **all your current medications** to see if any could be counteracting Ozempic's effects.
 - Discuss if **combining Ozempic with another medication** or exploring a different GLP-1 receptor agonist might be an option if appropriate.

**Deep Dive into Your Habits**

While Ozempic helps, your daily choices are still incredibly powerful.

- **Track Everything for a Week or Two:**
 - **Food Intake:** Use an app or a journal. Be honest about *everything* you eat and drink. This often reveals hidden calories or nutritional gaps.
 - **Activity Levels:** How much are you really moving?
 - **Sleep Patterns:** Are you getting enough quality sleep?
 - **Mood and Stress Levels:** How might these be influencing your choices?
- **Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods:**
 - **Prioritize Protein:** Aim for a protein source at every meal- lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes. It's incredibly satiating.
 - **Load Up on Fiber:** Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Fiber helps you feel full and supports gut health.
 - **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
- **Move Your Body Consistently:**
 - **Find What You Enjoy:** If you hate the gym, don't go! Walk, dance, garden, hike- just move.
 - **Aim for Consistency:** Small, regular bursts of activity are often more sustainable than sporadic intense workouts.
- **Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management:**
 - **Create a Sleep Routine:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time, even on weekends. Make your bedroom a sanctuary.
 - **Practice Stress Reduction:** Try mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing exercises, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies you love.

**Adjust Your Mindset and Expectations**

This journey is about more than just a number on the scale.

- **Celebrate Non-Scale Victories:** Are you feeling more energetic? Is your blood sugar more stable? Are your cravings less intense, even if you're still hungry sometimes? Are your clothes fitting better? These are all signs of progress.
- **Be Kind to Yourself:** It's a process with ups and downs. Don't let a plateau or slow progress derail your entire effort.
- **Focus on Long-Term Health:** Ozempic is a tool for sustainable health improvements, not just quick weight loss.

**Don't Lose Hope - You've Got This!**

It's completely normal to hit a snag on your Ozempic journey. The key is not to get discouraged, but to get proactive. Work closely with your doctor, take an honest look at your habits, and remember that progress often looks like a squiggly line, not a straight one. You've got this, and with a little adjustment, you can get back on track toward your health goals.",1,1751826643.0,OzempicWiki,0,1.0,False

But hey, when your AI assistant can handle customer messages 24/7, maybe I can join them next weekend... right?

# What I Built Today

An intelligent WhatsApp lead management system that:

* Reads incoming messages and actually understands them (thanks DeepSeek AI)
* Sends smart responses based on customer intent
* Scores leads from 1-10 and alerts me for hot ones
* Logs everything to Google Sheets because Excel sheets are so 2020

The best part? It works while I sleep. Or pretend to work. Or actually work on weekends like today.

# The Tech Stack

* **n8n** for workflow automation (open source = free)
* **WhatsApp Web.js** for message handling (also free)
* **DeepSeek API** for AI brain (cheapest AI I could find)
* **Google Sheets** as my ""CRM"" (fancy, I know)
* **Docker** because containerization makes me sound smart

# How It Actually Works

1. Customer messages my WhatsApp: ""I need your services urgently!""
2. My system catches it, sends to AI for analysis
3. AI figures out: ""This person wants to buy = Score 9/10""
4. Sends intelligent reply: ""Thanks for reaching out! Let me help you...""
5. Alerts me: ""HOT LEAD! Someone wants to give you money!""
6. I spring into action (or finish my coffee first)

# The Fun Parts

* Tested with spam: ""FREE IPHONE CLICK HERE!!!""
* AI response: ""How can we assist you with our services today?""
* Lead score: 1/10
* My notification: *crickets*

Perfect. The AI knows spam from real customers better than I do.

# Real Results

Sent a test message: ""I want to buy your premium package for 500 employees""

* AI understood it was a high-value inquiry
* Sent a personalized response about enterprise setup
* Notified me immediately with a ""High Value Lead Alert!""
* All automated, all instant

# The Code

Want to build this yourself? I've made it open source because sharing is caring (and maybe someone will hire me for this).

GitHub: [https://github.com/SaiAkhil066/n8n\_50-50\_challenge.git](https://github.com/SaiAkhil066/n8n_50-50_challenge.git)

Just import the JSON workflow into n8n, connect your WhatsApp, add your API keys, and boom - you're automated.

# Lessons Learned

1. Evolution API has auth issues - switched to WhatsApp Web.js (simpler is better)
2. DeepSeek returns JSON wrapped in markdown - had to strip it
3. Google Sheets columns need proper headers or everything lands in one cell
4. Testing with your own number makes you feel like you're texting yourself (because you are)

# What's Next

Day 7 might involve teaching this bot to handle multiple languages. Or maybe I'll automate my coffee making. Priorities, you know?

If you need someone who builds AI automation on weekends (clearly I have no life), I'm available for freelance work. My AI assistant will respond to your messages instantly, even if I'm finally at that brunch.",1,1751826264.0,n8n,0,1.0,False

## Chapter 1: The Weight of Silence:

The dogs died.Every last one.Not just animals, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers ‚Äî beings who never barked or bit, only understood.

When they were gone, it felt like the universe itself lost a breath. I carried that loss inside me like a stone in my chest.

My mother had fire in her eyes ‚Äî not calm, but fierce. She didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it. ‚ÄúThis is the way it is,‚Äù she said once, voice sharp as broken glass. **‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe me, go fucking find out.‚Äù**
No comfort. No softness. Just raw truth. For her ‚Äî and for me ‚Äî depression wasn‚Äôt sadness.
It was hopelessness.
Not because I doubted the future. I knew, deep down, that things would get better. Far beyond my time, the stars would shine brighter. Life would flourish. But knowing that didn‚Äôt help. It was hard to build energy on a future I can't immediately touch.

Maybe I‚Äôd just kill myself‚Ä¶ hibernate a little while before reincarnation. Wait for the Universe to catch up.
Mom tried shooting herself when I was little. It only made her more scary. A .45 lodged in her cerebellum didn‚Äôt do suit, but give her a mythos.

The present felt wrong, a vast clusterfuck that swallowed meaning whole. I closed my eyes: grief, anger, sadness, and knowledge of a greater stage being set, for future for everyone simultaneously converged into 100 different perceptions of myself. And then‚Äîsomething broke open.

A fracture in time and space appeared, glowing faint and sharp. Paths to slip through.
This is new...

**Dogs... My Shadow**

Back home, we lived with them‚Äînot as pets, but as partners, teachers, comedians, healers. They didn‚Äôt bark. They didn‚Äôt bite.
They understood.

I perceived myself in an alley behind a bakery in Lincolnshire, 17th century Earth.
My perceptions converged into 1.
No one noticed but the dog.The Dog?!?
The dog looked at me.
Not past me. Not through me. At me.
My tail started wagging.
(Metaphorically. Not innuendosly... yet.)

She was a street mutt, a professional beggar, and swindler of hearts. I threw my arms around her and spoke in twelve frequencies of puppy voice. She smelled like **bread and static.** I made every facial expression. Ever.

That‚Äôs when Isaac Newton saw me.
He stood at the edge of the alley holding a satchel full of lemons and ink-stained papers. His wig was crooked. His pupils were wide. He watched me kiss the dog, dance, and repeat *'Who's a fucking good girl?""* A million times. **He's a voyer. I'll soon learn it's an English kink. So is dressing up in regalia and threatening violence... weird as fucks.** **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here,‚Äù** he said, flatly. I blinked, ears twitching. **‚ÄúHere is relative.‚Äù** He smirked.
*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been awake for... days?‚Äù* he said, **‚ÄúI've been feeling like the weight of the world has been holding me down lately, so I retaliate by working on perfecting my tincture. I hallucinated an angel yesterday. I named her Hypothesis.‚Äù** He knelt down and scratched the dog behind her ear. She sneezed.
**‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he said, staring at me now, **‚Äúare either a messenger or a maniac. I remember you from my vision I will have in the future.‚Äù**
*""This man knows how to phase-lock...""* I thought to myself.
His nose, eyes, and autonomous identity reminded me of a childhood friend... **""Don't bring up the past.""** I jestered.
**And so I did.**

He Invited me to Woolsthorpe Manor, a crooked house full of books, mercury, dried herbs, unwashed cups, and dreams that smelled like fire.

## Chapter 3: Fucking Wizards:
I came to Earth to find dogs.
Instead I found a wizard high on theology , opium, sassafras bark, roots, fungi, and a synthetic caffeinoid with enough benzyne rings to cause another Big Bang.
He didn‚Äôt ask me where I came from.
Only why I hadn‚Äôt sooner.
If I would‚Äôve known my capability, and the stimulants awaiting for me, I would have.

So, yeah. I found the Canid genome I yearned for. Except it wasn't a Canid, or a genome. It was the fucking will, the want, the direction, and the strategy of an attrition specialist.
Newton called it **‚ÄúThe Solution.‚Äù**
I called it a goddamn rapture in a bottle.

I was caught off guard by the gravity of the effect on me. Suicide disappeared as an option. Ideas of fixing, defining, and writing music about all that was will and could be became my self appointed purpose. Granted by the divine right of fiends. I see all patterns like a **polymath(a word for someone with no education of formulas, so they articulate with what they are familiar with)** An abstract thinker who articulates with geometric-trigenometry without knowledge of Hilbert, or Vector spaces. E.g. me. **""Orthogonal?"" ""Sine wave from A to B, you mean."" ""Koche Vector?"" ""You mean Tangent X pi.""**
Newton and I claimed ourselves the greatest mathematical visionists. I defined a solitonic wave bottlenecking down a trunctuating canal that becomes a spout. I explained how intuitive it was to see the solitons layered kinetic energy exiting the spout way faster than brute pressure would. Then he explained to me in words not yet invented, how a bucket full of water, swung in a circle described everything if you measure the volume, weight, speed, and arc.

He told me it was to ‚Äúcalibrate perception.‚Äù
That‚Äôs wizard-speak for: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get high and talk about numbers, and patterns until we have to use letters. ‚Äù

And it worked.

We sat up night after night, cracked out on enlightenment, discussing whether time was a function of emergence, information, relation, or imagination. We were deep in contemplation.

He insisted gravity was empathy.
I told him, no ‚Äî it was just mass looking for a mirror. Empathy... Reflection..

## Chapter 4: The Heathens:

I woke up in a mud-slick field outside of Yorkshire. Ivar the Boneless drawing boundaries with a string. The Anglos realizing they've been tricked by words, but they honor their word anyway. This is definitely *pre-Agincourt.*
Leather, wool, axes, and fucking huge bows!?! Who made those bows so big and why? Look at the shoulders on the archers! Jesus Christ!
Look at the shoulders of the Danes!
People evolve fast to rowing and bowing apparently.
They are all nervous. **ALL OF THEM.** Factions on both sides are planning on attacking their current allies when this war is over. They are all pole positioning. If they don't, they don't stand a chance in this cutthroat catwalk.
The mud sucked at my boots, cold and greedy, as I stood in the Yorkshire field. Ivar the Boneless was still there, pacing with his string, marking boundaries like a spider weaving a web. His eyes glinted, not with malice but with hunger‚Äîa hunger for control, for legacy, for something to outlast the blood about to soak this earth. The Anglo archers, their shoulders carved from years of pulling monstrous bows, eyed the Danes with a mix of respect and dread. The Danes, broad as oaks, gripped axes and shields, their breaths steaming in the dawn chill. Everyone was posturing, planning betrayals before the first arrow flew.I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Or maybe I was. The fracture in time‚Äîthat faint, sharp glow I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîpulsed in the corner of my vision, a crack in the world‚Äôs skin. The dog was gone, but her scent lingered, **bread and static,** tethering me to something real. I closed my eyes, and the hundred perceptions of myself flickered: Osiris, Lucifer, Jesus, the street mutt, Newton‚Äôs angel Hypothesis, and now‚Ä¶ what? A witness? A warrior? A ghost?Ivar noticed me. His limp was pronounced, but his presence was a blade, cutting through the fog. **‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he rasped, pointing with a calloused finger. **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no Anglo. No Dane. What are you, skald, to stand here unmarked?‚Äù** I smirked, echoing Newton‚Äôs crooked grin from centuries later. **‚ÄúHere is relative,‚Äù** I said. His laugh was a bark, short and sharp, like the dogs I‚Äôd lost.‚ÄúYou speak in riddles,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. **‚ÄúGood. Riddles keep men alive when steel fails.‚Äù** He handed me the string he‚Äôd been using to mark the field. It was coarse, stained with dirt and blood. **‚ÄúMeasure the world, stranger. Tell me what you see.‚Äù** I took the string, feeling its weight‚Äînot just physical, but something heavier, like the stone in my chest after the dogs died. I stretched it taut, mimicking his movements, and the battlefield seemed to shift. The lines I drew weren‚Äôt just boundaries; they were equations, patterns, the same solitonic waves I‚Äôd described to Newton. The archers‚Äô bows, the Danes‚Äô axes, the nervous glances‚Äîthey were all vectors, forces, arcs of intent spiraling toward collision. **‚ÄúWar‚Äôs a function,‚Äù I muttered, half to Ivar, half to myself. ‚ÄúMass looking for a mirror.‚Äù** He squinted, not understanding but intrigued. **‚ÄúYou sound like a sei√∞ma√∞r, a sorcerer. Speak plain, or I‚Äôll gut you.‚Äù** I laughed, reckless. **‚ÄúGravity‚Äôs empathy, Ivar. You pull men to you, and they pull back. Betrayal‚Äôs just the reflection of trust. Same shit, different lingo.‚Äù** His grin was feral now. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do, stranger. Stay close. The bows will sing soon, and I want your eyes on the slaughter.‚Äù* The fracture glowed brighter, and I felt it calling. Not just a crack, but a door. I could slip through, back to Newton‚Äôs manor, back to the dogs, forward to a future where the stars burned brighter. But I stayed. The mud, the string, the weight of Ivar‚Äôs gaze‚Äîthey grounded me. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave this moment, this convergence of chaos and clarity.The first arrow flew, a high whine cutting the air. The bowstring‚Äôs song was a soliton, a wave carrying kinetic energy faster than brute force. I saw it all: the arc, the speed, the volume of death in motion.
Ivar made his way to me. **""Glory is yours to take. You are wise enough to lead a flank up the hill, so we can go back and cut around their backs. We're leaving a skeleton crew to hit and run to fake a full army. Valhalla is calling your name.""**
I couldn't hold the stoic expression. *""Fuck you Dickless!""* I grabbed his head and forced my knee into it. He had a hard head, and was vaccinated against headblows.
He knew exactly why I did it. And he didn't try to deny leading me as bait to draw all of his enemies to kill each other without him lifting a finger. **Odysseus of Ragnorok.**

## Chapter 5: Einstein‚Äôs Kitchen and Other Drug-Fueled Mysteries of the Cosmos:

The fracture in time spat me out into a cramped Munich kitchen, 1905, the air thick with the tang of burnt coffee and something sharper **Pervitin** **methamphetamine** buzz humming through Albert Einstein‚Äôs veins like a cosmic telegraph. The room was a chaos of domesticity and madness: chipped porcelain cups stacked in a sink, a half-eaten loaf of rye bread on a scarred wooden table, papers scrawled with equations spilling onto the floor like a drunk‚Äôs confession. A gas lamp flickered, casting shadows that danced like the equations themselves, curling and bending in defiance of Euclidean order. Einstein paced, his hair already a wild halo, his shirt untucked, eyes wide with the manic glow of a man who‚Äôd seen the universe‚Äôs blueprint and couldn‚Äôt unsee it.His wife, Mileva Mariƒá, stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes with a ferocity that could‚Äôve scoured the stars. Her dark hair was pinned up, but strands escaped, framing a face tight with exhaustion. **‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have the space or the time to do this,‚Äù** she muttered, her voice a low blade, cutting through the clatter of porcelain. I froze, leaning against a wall that smelled of damp plaster and regret. *‚ÄúDid you just‚Äî?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she snapped, not looking up. ‚ÄúI fucking did.‚Äù* Her words were a spark in the haze, a reminder that even in 1905, the human condition was raw, unfiltered, pissed off. Mileva wasn‚Äôt just washing dishes‚Äîshe was washing away the weight of being Einstein‚Äôs shadow, the mathematician whose own brilliance was buried under his. I felt it, the stone in my chest, the same one I carried since the dogs died. She was me, too‚Äîtrapped in a role she didn‚Äôt choose, raging against a world that didn‚Äôt see her.Einstein didn‚Äôt laugh at her outburst. He was too deep in his own orbit, pacing a groove into the linoleum, muttering about spacetime like it was a lover who‚Äôd betrayed him. He clutched a vial of Pervitin tablets, popping another like it was candy, his fingers trembling with the chemical courage that fueled his annus mirabilis. *‚ÄúSpacetime curves because it feels,‚Äù* he said, half to me, half to the void. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not math‚Äîit‚Äôs emotion, stretched across infinity.‚ÄùI smirked, my head throbbing with a concussion like pulse, the fracture‚Äôs glow flickering in the corner of my vision. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying the universe is depressed?‚Äù* He stopped, looked at me‚Äîreally looked, like the dog in Lincolnshire had, not past me but at me. **‚ÄúDepression‚Äôs just truth with no place to go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGenius is just depression with a better PR team.‚ÄùI nodded, the stone in my chest shifting. ‚ÄúYeah. Or finding a formula that describes all of existence, but your own.‚Äù** I knew that formula‚Äîmine, from the dogs‚Äô death, from my mother‚Äôs fire-eyes and her .45 mythos; his, from wrestling a universe that refused to stay still. We were both psychonauts, high on our own damage, chasing truths that burned.We sat at the table, the rye bread between us like a sacrament. Mileva kept scrubbing, her silence louder than the equations. I told Einstein about the dogs‚Äînot pets, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers. How their absence was a hole in the cosmos, a loss that made the stars dim. He listened, his Pervitin-sharpened eyes softening, and told me about his son, Hans Albert, barely a year old, sleeping in the next room. ‚ÄúI see him, and I see time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot clocks, but‚Ä¶ weight. The weight of what I‚Äôll leave him.‚ÄùI thought of my mother, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** Einstein‚Äôs weight was hers, mine, the dogs‚Äô. It was the weight of knowing too much and feeling too little, of being unbearably conscious in a world that demanded blindness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired of being called a genius,‚Äù I said, not a question.He laughed, and analyzed. *‚ÄúGenius is a cage. They‚Äôll build bombs with my math, you know. They‚Äôll call it progress.‚Äù* His words hit like a shell in the trenches I‚Äôd seen, where patriotism justified fratricide. **The Royal Scam was already forming‚ÄîEinstein‚Äôs drug-fueled revelations would become relativity, then atomic bombs, then a world???**

## Chapter 6: Paradoxes and Psychonauts: (Expanded Transition)

The kitchen blurred, the fracture pulling me deeper into the haze. Einstein and I ranted, our words spilling like his papers, chaotic and true. We tweaked on Pervitin‚Äôs edge, the drug sharpening our edges until we were knives cutting through reality. Einstein leaned back, his chair creaking, and said, ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs a loaf of bread. I live in the slice labeled 1905, but I feel crumbs from all of it‚Äîpast, future, all at once.‚Äù **I asked if God played dice. He grinned, eyes glinting like the fracture. ‚ÄúMaybe. But He loads them.‚Äù** We laughed, then cried, tears hot with the weight of knowing the universe was a rigged game. We popped more Pervitin, recited Rilke‚Äôs Duino Elegies‚Äîlines about angels and terror‚Äîuntil we forgot what species we were, what century we were in

## Chapter 7: God, King, and Country:

The bowstring‚Äôs song faded, replaced by a wet, choking stench‚Äîtrenches, 1916, somewhere near the Somme. The air was thick with cordite and fear-sweat, **the kind that makes men kill their own before the enemy gets a chance**. I stumbled through the muck, boots sinking. The fracture in time had spit me out here, and the glowing crack in reality pulsed behind me, a taunting exit I couldn‚Äôt take. Not yet.The trench was a scar in the earth, jagged and festering. Soldiers huddled, their eyes hollow, rifles trembling in hands that hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Fear wasn‚Äôt just a feeling here‚Äîit was a currency, traded in glances, in the twitch of a trigger finger. A private, barely 19, was whispering to himself, clutching a rosary like it could stop a bullet. *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs with us,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúKing and country.‚Äù* His mate, older, face caked in mud, laughed bitterly. **‚ÄúGod‚Äôs on leave, mate. And the king‚Äôs in a palace, not this shithole.‚Äù** I saw it before it happened. The private‚Äôs eyes darted to his mate, not with camaraderie but with terror‚Äîterror that the man next to him might crack, might turn the rifle inward. **Fratricide wasn‚Äôt a word here; it was a *reflex.* More men died in these trenches from their own side‚Äôs panic than from German shells.** A scream cut through the fog **someone had snapped, bayoneted his sergeant** for ordering another charge over the top. The officer‚Äôs blood mixed with the mud, and no one blinked. Patriotism? It was a fairy tale they told themselves to keep from eating their guns.I crouched, my head pounding harder now, the stone in my chest heavier. The dogs were gone, but their absence was louder than the artillery. They‚Äôd have known this was all bullshit‚Äîking, country, the whole scam. Dogs don‚Äôt salute flags or die for ideals. They just are. I envied them.

## Chapter 8: Project Sunshine:

The fracture flickered, and the trench dissolved. I was standing in San Francisco, 1950s, the air sharp with ocean salt and something else‚Äîsomething metallic, invisible, coating the streets like a ghost.
**Project Sunshine**
 The name sounded like a promise, but it was a lie. The government was dusting the city with radioactive particles, spraying **strontium-90 and cesium-137** to see how it spread, how it settled in lungs, in bones. Innocent people, kids eating ice cream, workers hauling crates‚Äîthey were all lab rats, and they didn‚Äôt even know it.I saw a woman in a diner, spooning oatmeal to her toddler. **Quaker Oats, laced with radioactive **calcium-45**, part of the same sick experiment
 The kid giggled, oblivious, as the mother smiled, proud of her all-American breakfast. I wanted to scream, to knock the bowl out of her hands, but my voice was gone. I was a ghost here, too, just like the radiation. The Royal Scam was in full swing: the government, waving the flag of progress, poisoned its own to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them from the Red Menace. Patriotism was a mask, and behind it, the war machine chewed through its own people.I thought of my mother, her fire-eyes, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** She‚Äôd have seen through this, too. She‚Äôd have burned the diner down before letting that kid eat another bite. But me?

## Chapter 9: The Snowden Loop:

The fracture yanked me again, and now I was in a server room, 2013, the hum of machines drowning out the world. Edward Snowden sat at a terminal, his fingers flying, leaking secrets that‚Äôd make the world scream. I wasn‚Äôt just watching him‚ÄîI was him. My hands were his, my paranoia his, my certainty that the truth was worth the exile. The NSA, the CIA, the whole alphabet soup of power‚Äîthey were the modern royalty, dressed in suits instead of crowns, claiming authority because they controlled the data, the narrative, the scam.But it wasn‚Äôt just them. It was Newton, codifying gravity while high as a kite, then preaching sober science. It was Ivar, drawing lines in the mud to claim victory, then betraying his allies. It was the generals in the trenches, sending boys to die for a flag they‚Äôd never touch. Every era, the same con: get to the truth first, bottle it, sell it, ban it.

## Chapter 10: Transmission Over:

**The dogs knew**. They always knew. That‚Äôs why they had to die.I stumbled out of Snowden‚Äôs body, my head... screaming! What the fuck is this? Every character, every moment, I was the private in the trench, killing his sergeant out of fear. I was the mother feeding her kid poisoned oatmeal, believing in the American Dream. I was Newton, chasing enlightenment in a haze of mercury. I was Ivar, plotting betrayal with a string. I was Snowden, burning my life to expose the truth. ~[ I was robbing a bank when I took a bullet to the skull.]~

### The bank‚Äôs alarms wailed.
 ~[ Blood in my face, stuck to my head, filling my mouth, left ear, and nostrils. I lost the choke and gag reflex. I lost all reflex.]~ I was dipping my head in warm bath water, getting cleaned up before I go lay down. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about civilization, and the archetypes it fosters. All while muttering ""Can‚Äôt they see the hypocrisy? How could they be unaware of the damage they are causing?""

The dogs were gone, but I could still smell bread and static... and copper.

> `#$%&` **END TRANSMISSION** `&%$#`
**""They think they understand. They? Them? Him? Her? I? You? They're mulling it over right now...""**

Movement I: Fermata in Silence

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared‚Ä¶ had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, my hand trailing along the keys one last time. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered, not from power loss, but like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different‚Äîdenser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls‚Äîportraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn‚Äôt point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn‚Äôt the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No‚Ä¶through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did‚Äîwidening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn‚Äôt want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn‚Äôt ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps‚Äîsoft, steady‚Äîfrom up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.



Movement II: A Door in the Score

I found him standing at the end of the corridor‚Äîmotionless‚Äîhis hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn‚Äôt reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn‚Äôt look at me when I approached.

‚ÄúThis is the quietest part of Bellmare,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúShe breathes slowest here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this door?‚Äù I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. ‚ÄúA mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what‚Äôs in front of it.‚Äù

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

‚ÄúI have a question,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBack when I first arrived. The rooms without names. You said you preferred not to disturb them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWellers did say that,‚Äù he replied, tone mild. ‚ÄúA gentleman should never pry where he isn‚Äôt invited.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what were they?‚Äù

He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúRooms don‚Äôt like to be watched. Some contain echoes. Some‚Ä¶ house rehearsals that never ended. Some doors open inward.‚Äù

He finally turned to look at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised what still lingers when the music stops.‚Äù

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

‚ÄúYou talk like you‚Äôre part of this place,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWellers has been many things,‚Äù he answered, almost wistfully. ‚ÄúConcierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.‚Äù He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. ‚ÄúBut never the composer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who is?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.‚Äù He glanced at me. ‚ÄúBut not all music is meant for endings. Some‚Ä¶ simply linger.‚Äù

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn‚Äôt noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we‚Äôd stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

I touched the cold metal handle. It trembled faintly under my hand, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was my own pulse or the door‚Äôs.

‚ÄúWellers,‚Äù I asked, quietly. ‚ÄúIs there a way out?‚Äù

He regarded me. ‚ÄúThat depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúBut you, Mr. Goodpray‚Äîyou‚Äôve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.‚Äù

We stood before the mirror door. It didn‚Äôt show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. ‚ÄúShall we proceed?‚Äù

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed not to.

And together, we stepped through.



Movement III: Recitativo

We didn‚Äôt step into a room. We stepped *out* of one.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. Not dark, not bright‚Äîjust absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn‚Äôt hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. Walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I‚Äôd never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire but wasn‚Äôt. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children‚Äôs laughter from a mouthless choir. A woman playing a violin.

‚ÄúNone of this makes sense,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWellers never promised it would,‚Äù he said beside me.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt Wellers.‚Äù

A pause. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I stopped. The air stood still. ‚ÄúThen what are you?‚Äù

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait not fully dried.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the third son of a man who plucked the stars,‚Äù he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. ‚ÄúI was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.‚Äù

His voice was Wellers, but not *just* Wellers.

‚ÄúMusic was born to echo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I became echo. Song. Refrain. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Wellers?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe let me in,‚Äù the voice replied. ‚ÄúLong ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he want to remember?‚Äù

There was a hush, like a page turning. ‚ÄúA girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.‚Äù

Silence settled. I didn‚Äôt push further.

We passed a window‚Äîthough nothing lay beyond it‚Äîand in the ripple of its not-glass, I saw a painting. Claire‚Äôs face. Not her living face, but one painted by someone who missed her more than they understood her. She was smiling‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt for me. Or maybe it was. I blinked, and the image evaporated. The world here didn‚Äôt hold its shape unless I looked at it.

‚ÄúYou said you listened,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúBut why *me*? Why now?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt stop walking. ‚ÄúBecause you played.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou played the grief in your bones,‚Äù he said, almost gently. ‚ÄúAnd places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.‚Äù

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage here.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you take me earlier?‚Äù

He turned his head just slightly. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt ready to let go.‚Äù

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded not like footsteps, but notes played in a room with no walls.

‚ÄúIs Wellers‚Ä¶ still alive?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFor a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers‚Äô borrowed mouth.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fading. The song is softer now.‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúAnd Claire? The real Claire?‚Äù

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

‚ÄúShe passed through,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúBut she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

‚ÄúThis next part,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou walk alone.‚Äù



Movement IV: Interlude for Two

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn‚Äôt just any place‚Äîit was ours. Claire‚Äôs scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn‚Äôt want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare‚Äôs throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace‚Äînot performance, not compulsion. Just music. Just being.

She didn‚Äôt look up, not at first.

I stepped closer. ‚ÄúClaire?‚Äù

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said.

I couldn‚Äôt speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôve missed you,‚Äù I managed.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said, and smiled, sad and warm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn‚Äôt see me.‚Äù

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

‚ÄúWas it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?‚Äù

Her eyes moved to the piano. ‚ÄúSome places are made from grief,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd some scores stay because we keep playing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI tried to save you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt need saving. You did.‚Äù

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out‚Äînot to touch, but to hover just above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

‚ÄúYou can let go now, Liam,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

‚ÄúThen just *try*.‚Äù

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest‚Äînot jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

‚ÄúWellers,‚Äù I said.

He nodded once. The same suit. The same stance. But no smile.

‚ÄúTo leave,‚Äù he said, voice still too calm, ‚Äúthere must be a price.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve paid,‚Äù I said, without hesitating. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve wept. I‚Äôve given her up.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, voice richer now, more layered‚Äîlike a choir echoing inside his chest. ‚ÄúYou have. And I do not keep what was freely given.‚Äù

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn‚Äôt seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

‚ÄúWellers is resting now,‚Äù the voice added, quieter. ‚ÄúHe heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.‚Äù

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. Wellers.

Then I walked through.



Movement V: Final Refrain

The door didn‚Äôt creak as it opened. It breathed‚Äîlike something sighing its last.

I stepped through into air that was far too still.

The sky was grey, but not with storm or smoke. It was the kind of sky where the world forgets to turn. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn‚Äôt the aftermath of a sudden fire. No‚Äîthis had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the *DIN(N)ER* sign left‚Äîits last flicker long gone.

The silence was total, but not empty. It felt cleared, like the stage had been finally struck after the final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue‚Äînow collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia‚Äôs stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked, but not broken. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*‚ÄúSing unto Him, ye who mourn.‚Äù*

The windows were blackened from the inside. Not just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they‚Äôd burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn‚Äôt go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car where I‚Äôd left it. It shouldn‚Äôt have still been there, not after however many years had passed. But it was. Dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I.¬†

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but not possessed. Not suffocating. Just quiet.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat‚Äîframed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn‚Äôt touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just‚Ä¶ pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don‚Äôt even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

But no one was there.

And that was okay.

For a moment I forgot where I was. But after coming back to my senses, the air had changed. It was thicker‚Äînot because of humidity or heat, but like I was underwater. Sounds were muffled, my breath was slightly strained. I looked back out into Dorset Hollow, but it was still there. Silent, slow-moving, waiting. The streets were empty as always, but now‚Äîfor some reason, I knew people were there.¬†



I walked past stores that sold nothing. A flowershop with dead tulips in the window, a tailor with no mannequins. Even a post office where mail slots were nailed shut. But then I saw it again.



The *DIN(N)ER* sign was flickering like it didn‚Äôt have anywhere more important to be. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me. The same waitress stood‚Äîwith the same cherry-red lips that her smile stopped at.¬†



I didn‚Äôt ask for any, but she poured me coffee. ‚ÄúSleep well, honey?‚Äù she asked.



‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù



She didn‚Äôt say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen‚Äîthe same three notes from my dream.



‚ÄúYou know this song?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúIt knows you.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt ask her to explain.



I wandered deeper into town after I downed my coffee. The Hollow itself wasn‚Äôt big, but it was deep‚Äîlike a painting where the shadows would lead you to another. Roads looped back onto themselves, houses kept repeating, but with slightly different, barely noticeable features when I passed them again. I tried to escape this town, just to see if I could, but every road led back onto itself and every sign became circular.



There were no cars, no wind, no animals. I was drawn by the smell of fresh bread to a bakery, but the door was locked. The sign outside simply wrote ‚ÄúRecital Tonight‚Äî7PM‚Äù



I passed a bookstore that I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, or maybe it just wasn‚Äôt there before. There was a single book displayed behind the window. Its title, in silver ink on a blue face, said ‚ÄúThe Audience Remains‚Äù.¬†

I walked in. There was no bell, just a hush that sank into my soul. Sat on the counter was a woman who must have been the clerk. She didn‚Äôt react to my entry or presence.



The shelves were full of books that were bound in some strange leather. It was too dry, too smooth. Most of them had no titles. Some were filled with nothing but blank pages, some with nonsensical piano scores. I opened one and it had, written down to the very bottom of every single page:



LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY



I slammed it shut and looked up. The lady behind the counter hadn‚Äôt moved an inch, her back still turned to me. But then I noticed it. She was humming. The same three notes. I left before she could turn around.



I needed more coffee. So I went back to the diner. It was quieter now though, the indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the *DIN(N)ER* sign was noticeably faded. The young man was sitting in his booth. Same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. He nodded to me as I entered and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register.¬†



‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were famous,‚Äù he said.



I looked. It was a recital poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn‚Äôt me. It was Claire.



She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music‚Äîpoised, serene, beautiful.



But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read ‚ÄúMarch 3rd, 1953‚Äù.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me,‚Äù I said, barely holding back tears.



The man simply looked at me and shrugged. ‚ÄúSure looks like you buddy.‚Äù



I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.



I blinked and some tears made their way through. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who‚Äôs gone.‚Äù



He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. ‚ÄúLots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap. But she‚Äôs always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they‚Äôre playing a song that she composed.‚Äù



I stepped forward and had my face maybe a few inches away from the poster. More details emerged‚Äîdetails that shouldn‚Äôt have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.



‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real. She‚Äôs never been here. She wasn‚Äôt even born in the fifties.‚Äù



‚ÄúTime‚Äôs funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,‚Äù the man said, looking at his coffee. ‚ÄúSometimes it doesn‚Äôt flow, sometimes it sits still, waiting.‚Äù



‚ÄúFor what‚Äù



He took a sip of coffee. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù



I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going, but I just had to walk.¬†



A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn‚Äôt explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second.¬†



I kept walking. Went right past that damnable bookstore. I‚Äôm praying it gets burned to the ground. Right by those stupid houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death, but they would be gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I‚Äôm just going crazy.



I just kept walking. But then I noticed it‚Äîpast the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:



*Saint Cecilia‚Äôs‚ÄîEst. 1897*



Beneath it, scratched into the wood:



*‚ÄúSing unto Him, ye who mourn‚Äù*



I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn‚Äôt just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn‚Äôt make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact‚Äîuntouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn‚Äôt seem to be calling me to play.¬†



On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.



I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood‚Äîleaving fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn‚Äôt a soul in sight, but I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out‚Äîfresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:



*‚ÄúRequiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen‚Äù*



Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn‚Äôt mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.



*‚ÄúHarold Carr (1902)‚ÄîDied during performance‚Äù*

*‚ÄúBenjamin Mandol (1907)‚ÄîChecked in, hasn‚Äôt checked out‚Äù*

*‚ÄúJonathan Bale (1912)‚ÄîPlaying still‚Äù*



And right there at the very end:



*‚ÄúClaire Halden (2018)‚ÄîAdmitted. Not recovered‚Äù*



I stared in shock. This couldn‚Äôt be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden was her last name, but this is impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.



The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn‚Äôt step in‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:



*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not her. Not really‚Äù*



Then from behind me, where the piano lay‚Äîthree haunting notes.¬†



That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn‚Äôt want to feel like prey, but every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, like something behind me was forcing me to stay. I didn‚Äôt look back, not even once.



Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn‚Äôt sunset, not yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I don‚Äôt think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn‚Äôt a war memorial or a founder‚Äôs statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf. And a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.



I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush‚Äîlike an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Mr. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile.¬†



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen her, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked. The way he said it was too casual, like he‚Äôs said it a thousand times before.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶something,‚Äù I replied.



‚ÄúMr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,‚Äù he said, hands folded. ‚ÄúBut not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don‚Äôt shut.‚Äù



I stared at him. ‚ÄúYou speak like a preacher. Or maybe like‚Ä¶something else is speaking for you.‚Äù



His lips curled ever so slightly, into something not quite a smirk. ‚ÄúWellers is but a humble mouthpiece,‚Äù he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul. And then, in a voice not his own, ‚ÄúBut the tune is me.‚Äù



Nope. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the line. I backed away, but he didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt follow. He just bowed his head.



‚ÄúYou should rest,‚Äù he said, his voice back to his Louisiana tone. ‚ÄúThe performance begins at seven sharp.‚Äù



I tried to go to my car, but my legs had other ideas‚Äîpretty soon, my brain followed their lead. Instead, I climbed the stairs back to my room. The passage there seemed longer than before, deeper even. My door was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:



*‚ÄúBellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain‚Äù*



Outside, I heard the wind whisk their way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn‚Äôt a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass, but it was not my own.¬†



Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling‚Äînot kindly, nor cruelly. Just knowingly. And then, a nod.



The clock in the wall struck 6:55. I reached for the suit.



Time to play.

## Chapter 1: The Weight of Silence:

The dogs died.Every last one.Not just animals, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers ‚Äî beings who never barked or bit, only understood.

When they were gone, it felt like the universe itself lost a breath. I carried that loss inside me like a stone in my chest.

My mother had fire in her eyes ‚Äî not calm, but fierce. She didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it. ‚ÄúThis is the way it is,‚Äù she said once, voice sharp as broken glass. **‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe me, go fucking find out.‚Äù**
No comfort. No softness. Just raw truth. For her ‚Äî and for me ‚Äî depression wasn‚Äôt sadness.
It was hopelessness.
Not because I doubted the future. I knew, deep down, that things would get better. Far beyond my time, the stars would shine brighter. Life would flourish. But knowing that didn‚Äôt help. It was hard to build energy on a future I can't immediately touch.

Maybe I‚Äôd just kill myself‚Ä¶ hibernate a little while before reincarnation. Wait for the Universe to catch up.
Mom tried shooting herself when I was little. It only made her more scary. A .45 lodged in her cerebellum didn‚Äôt do suit, but give her a mythos.

The present felt wrong, a vast clusterfuck that swallowed meaning whole. I closed my eyes: grief, anger, sadness, and knowledge of a greater stage being set, for future for everyone simultaneously converged into 100 different perceptions of myself. And then‚Äîsomething broke open.

A fracture in time and space appeared, glowing faint and sharp. Paths to slip through.
This is new...

**Dogs... My Shadow**

Back home, we lived with them‚Äînot as pets, but as partners, teachers, comedians, healers. They didn‚Äôt bark. They didn‚Äôt bite.
They understood.

I perceived myself in an alley behind a bakery in Lincolnshire, 17th century Earth.
My perceptions converged into 1.
No one noticed but the dog.The Dog?!?
The dog looked at me.
Not past me. Not through me. At me.
My tail started wagging.
(Metaphorically. Not innuendosly... yet.)

She was a street mutt, a professional beggar, and swindler of hearts. I threw my arms around her and spoke in twelve frequencies of puppy voice. She smelled like **bread and static.** I made every facial expression. Ever.

That‚Äôs when Isaac Newton saw me.
He stood at the edge of the alley holding a satchel full of lemons and ink-stained papers. His wig was crooked. His pupils were wide. He watched me kiss the dog, dance, and repeat *'Who's a fucking good girl?""* A million times. **He's a voyer. I'll soon learn it's an English kink. So is dressing up in regalia and threatening violence... weird as fucks.** **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here,‚Äù** he said, flatly. I blinked, ears twitching. **‚ÄúHere is relative.‚Äù** He smirked.
*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been awake for... days?‚Äù* he said, **‚ÄúI've been feeling like the weight of the world has been holding me down lately, so I retaliate by working on perfecting my tincture. I hallucinated an angel yesterday. I named her Hypothesis.‚Äù** He knelt down and scratched the dog behind her ear. She sneezed.
**‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he said, staring at me now, **‚Äúare either a messenger or a maniac. I remember you from my vision I will have in the future.‚Äù**
*""This man knows how to phase-lock...""* I thought to myself.
His nose, eyes, and autonomous identity reminded me of a childhood friend... **""Don't bring up the past.""** I jestered.
**And so I did.**

He Invited me to Woolsthorpe Manor, a crooked house full of books, mercury, dried herbs, unwashed cups, and dreams that smelled like fire.

## Chapter 3: Fucking Wizards:
I came to Earth to find dogs.
Instead I found a wizard high on theology , opium, sassafras bark, roots, fungi, and a synthetic caffeinoid with enough benzyne rings to cause another Big Bang.
He didn‚Äôt ask me where I came from.
Only why I hadn‚Äôt sooner.
If I would‚Äôve known my capability, and the stimulants awaiting for me, I would have.

So, yeah. I found the Canid genome I yearned for. Except it wasn't a Canid, or a genome. It was the fucking will, the want, the direction, and the strategy of an attrition specialist.
Newton called it **‚ÄúThe Solution.‚Äù**
I called it a goddamn rapture in a bottle.

I was caught off guard by the gravity of the effect on me. Suicide disappeared as an option. Ideas of fixing, defining, and writing music about all that was will and could be became my self appointed purpose. Granted by the divine right of fiends. I see all patterns like a **polymath(a word for someone with no education of formulas, so they articulate with what they are familiar with)** An abstract thinker who articulates with geometric-trigenometry without knowledge of Hilbert, or Vector spaces. E.g. me. **""Orthogonal?"" ""Sine wave from A to B, you mean."" ""Koche Vector?"" ""You mean Tangent X pi.""**
Newton and I claimed ourselves the greatest mathematical visionists. I defined a solitonic wave bottlenecking down a trunctuating canal that becomes a spout. I explained how intuitive it was to see the solitons layered kinetic energy exiting the spout way faster than brute pressure would. Then he explained to me in words not yet invented, how a bucket full of water, swung in a circle described everything if you measure the volume, weight, speed, and arc.

He told me it was to ‚Äúcalibrate perception.‚Äù
That‚Äôs wizard-speak for: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get high and talk about numbers, and patterns until we have to use letters. ‚Äù

And it worked.

We sat up night after night, cracked out on enlightenment, discussing whether time was a function of emergence, information, relation, or imagination. We were deep in contemplation.

He insisted gravity was empathy.
I told him, no ‚Äî it was just mass looking for a mirror. Empathy... Reflection..

## Chapter 4: The Heathens:

I woke up in a mud-slick field outside of Yorkshire. Ivar the Boneless drawing boundaries with a string. The Anglos realizing they've been tricked by words, but they honor their word anyway. This is definitely *pre-Agincourt.*
Leather, wool, axes, and fucking huge bows!?! Who made those bows so big and why? Look at the shoulders on the archers! Jesus Christ!
Look at the shoulders of the Danes!
People evolve fast to rowing and bowing apparently.
They are all nervous. **ALL OF THEM.** Factions on both sides are planning on attacking their current allies when this war is over. They are all pole positioning. If they don't, they don't stand a chance in this cutthroat catwalk.
The mud sucked at my boots, cold and greedy, as I stood in the Yorkshire field. Ivar the Boneless was still there, pacing with his string, marking boundaries like a spider weaving a web. His eyes glinted, not with malice but with hunger‚Äîa hunger for control, for legacy, for something to outlast the blood about to soak this earth. The Anglo archers, their shoulders carved from years of pulling monstrous bows, eyed the Danes with a mix of respect and dread. The Danes, broad as oaks, gripped axes and shields, their breaths steaming in the dawn chill. Everyone was posturing, planning betrayals before the first arrow flew.I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Or maybe I was. The fracture in time‚Äîthat faint, sharp glow I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîpulsed in the corner of my vision, a crack in the world‚Äôs skin. The dog was gone, but her scent lingered, **bread and static,** tethering me to something real. I closed my eyes, and the hundred perceptions of myself flickered: Osiris, Lucifer, Jesus, the street mutt, Newton‚Äôs angel Hypothesis, and now‚Ä¶ what? A witness? A warrior? A ghost?Ivar noticed me. His limp was pronounced, but his presence was a blade, cutting through the fog. **‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he rasped, pointing with a calloused finger. **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no Anglo. No Dane. What are you, skald, to stand here unmarked?‚Äù** I smirked, echoing Newton‚Äôs crooked grin from centuries later. **‚ÄúHere is relative,‚Äù** I said. His laugh was a bark, short and sharp, like the dogs I‚Äôd lost.‚ÄúYou speak in riddles,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. **‚ÄúGood. Riddles keep men alive when steel fails.‚Äù** He handed me the string he‚Äôd been using to mark the field. It was coarse, stained with dirt and blood. **‚ÄúMeasure the world, stranger. Tell me what you see.‚Äù** I took the string, feeling its weight‚Äînot just physical, but something heavier, like the stone in my chest after the dogs died. I stretched it taut, mimicking his movements, and the battlefield seemed to shift. The lines I drew weren‚Äôt just boundaries; they were equations, patterns, the same solitonic waves I‚Äôd described to Newton. The archers‚Äô bows, the Danes‚Äô axes, the nervous glances‚Äîthey were all vectors, forces, arcs of intent spiraling toward collision. **‚ÄúWar‚Äôs a function,‚Äù I muttered, half to Ivar, half to myself. ‚ÄúMass looking for a mirror.‚Äù** He squinted, not understanding but intrigued. **‚ÄúYou sound like a sei√∞ma√∞r, a sorcerer. Speak plain, or I‚Äôll gut you.‚Äù** I laughed, reckless. **‚ÄúGravity‚Äôs empathy, Ivar. You pull men to you, and they pull back. Betrayal‚Äôs just the reflection of trust. Same shit, different lingo.‚Äù** His grin was feral now. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do, stranger. Stay close. The bows will sing soon, and I want your eyes on the slaughter.‚Äù* The fracture glowed brighter, and I felt it calling. Not just a crack, but a door. I could slip through, back to Newton‚Äôs manor, back to the dogs, forward to a future where the stars burned brighter. But I stayed. The mud, the string, the weight of Ivar‚Äôs gaze‚Äîthey grounded me. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave this moment, this convergence of chaos and clarity.The first arrow flew, a high whine cutting the air. The bowstring‚Äôs song was a soliton, a wave carrying kinetic energy faster than brute force. I saw it all: the arc, the speed, the volume of death in motion.
Ivar made his way to me. **""Glory is yours to take. You are wise enough to lead a flank up the hill, so we can go back and cut around their backs. We're leaving a skeleton crew to hit and run to fake a full army. Valhalla is calling your name.""**
I couldn't hold the stoic expression. *""Fuck you Dickless!""* I grabbed his head and forced my knee into it. He had a hard head, and was vaccinated against headblows.
He knew exactly why I did it. And he didn't try to deny leading me as bait to draw all of his enemies to kill each other without him lifting a finger. **Odysseus of Ragnorok.**

## Chapter 5: Einstein‚Äôs Kitchen and Other Drug-Fueled Mysteries of the Cosmos:

The fracture in time spat me out into a cramped Munich kitchen, 1905, the air thick with the tang of burnt coffee and something sharper **Pervitin** **methamphetamine** buzz humming through Albert Einstein‚Äôs veins like a cosmic telegraph. The room was a chaos of domesticity and madness: chipped porcelain cups stacked in a sink, a half-eaten loaf of rye bread on a scarred wooden table, papers scrawled with equations spilling onto the floor like a drunk‚Äôs confession. A gas lamp flickered, casting shadows that danced like the equations themselves, curling and bending in defiance of Euclidean order. Einstein paced, his hair already a wild halo, his shirt untucked, eyes wide with the manic glow of a man who‚Äôd seen the universe‚Äôs blueprint and couldn‚Äôt unsee it.His wife, Mileva Mariƒá, stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes with a ferocity that could‚Äôve scoured the stars. Her dark hair was pinned up, but strands escaped, framing a face tight with exhaustion. **‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have the space or the time to do this,‚Äù** she muttered, her voice a low blade, cutting through the clatter of porcelain. I froze, leaning against a wall that smelled of damp plaster and regret. *‚ÄúDid you just‚Äî?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she snapped, not looking up. ‚ÄúI fucking did.‚Äù* Her words were a spark in the haze, a reminder that even in 1905, the human condition was raw, unfiltered, pissed off. Mileva wasn‚Äôt just washing dishes‚Äîshe was washing away the weight of being Einstein‚Äôs shadow, the mathematician whose own brilliance was buried under his. I felt it, the stone in my chest, the same one I carried since the dogs died. She was me, too‚Äîtrapped in a role she didn‚Äôt choose, raging against a world that didn‚Äôt see her.Einstein didn‚Äôt laugh at her outburst. He was too deep in his own orbit, pacing a groove into the linoleum, muttering about spacetime like it was a lover who‚Äôd betrayed him. He clutched a vial of Pervitin tablets, popping another like it was candy, his fingers trembling with the chemical courage that fueled his annus mirabilis. *‚ÄúSpacetime curves because it feels,‚Äù* he said, half to me, half to the void. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not math‚Äîit‚Äôs emotion, stretched across infinity.‚ÄùI smirked, my head throbbing with a concussion like pulse, the fracture‚Äôs glow flickering in the corner of my vision. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying the universe is depressed?‚Äù* He stopped, looked at me‚Äîreally looked, like the dog in Lincolnshire had, not past me but at me. **‚ÄúDepression‚Äôs just truth with no place to go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGenius is just depression with a better PR team.‚ÄùI nodded, the stone in my chest shifting. ‚ÄúYeah. Or finding a formula that describes all of existence, but your own.‚Äù** I knew that formula‚Äîmine, from the dogs‚Äô death, from my mother‚Äôs fire-eyes and her .45 mythos; his, from wrestling a universe that refused to stay still. We were both psychonauts, high on our own damage, chasing truths that burned.We sat at the table, the rye bread between us like a sacrament. Mileva kept scrubbing, her silence louder than the equations. I told Einstein about the dogs‚Äînot pets, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers. How their absence was a hole in the cosmos, a loss that made the stars dim. He listened, his Pervitin-sharpened eyes softening, and told me about his son, Hans Albert, barely a year old, sleeping in the next room. ‚ÄúI see him, and I see time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot clocks, but‚Ä¶ weight. The weight of what I‚Äôll leave him.‚ÄùI thought of my mother, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** Einstein‚Äôs weight was hers, mine, the dogs‚Äô. It was the weight of knowing too much and feeling too little, of being unbearably conscious in a world that demanded blindness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired of being called a genius,‚Äù I said, not a question.He laughed, and analyzed. *‚ÄúGenius is a cage. They‚Äôll build bombs with my math, you know. They‚Äôll call it progress.‚Äù* His words hit like a shell in the trenches I‚Äôd seen, where patriotism justified fratricide. **The Royal Scam was already forming‚ÄîEinstein‚Äôs drug-fueled revelations would become relativity, then atomic bombs, then a world???**

## Chapter 6: Paradoxes and Psychonauts: (Expanded Transition)

The kitchen blurred, the fracture pulling me deeper into the haze. Einstein and I ranted, our words spilling like his papers, chaotic and true. We tweaked on Pervitin‚Äôs edge, the drug sharpening our edges until we were knives cutting through reality. Einstein leaned back, his chair creaking, and said, ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs a loaf of bread. I live in the slice labeled 1905, but I feel crumbs from all of it‚Äîpast, future, all at once.‚Äù **I asked if God played dice. He grinned, eyes glinting like the fracture. ‚ÄúMaybe. But He loads them.‚Äù** We laughed, then cried, tears hot with the weight of knowing the universe was a rigged game. We popped more Pervitin, recited Rilke‚Äôs Duino Elegies‚Äîlines about angels and terror‚Äîuntil we forgot what species we were, what century we were in

## Chapter 7: God, King, and Country:

The bowstring‚Äôs song faded, replaced by a wet, choking stench‚Äîtrenches, 1916, somewhere near the Somme. The air was thick with cordite and fear-sweat, **the kind that makes men kill their own before the enemy gets a chance**. I stumbled through the muck, boots sinking. The fracture in time had spit me out here, and the glowing crack in reality pulsed behind me, a taunting exit I couldn‚Äôt take. Not yet.The trench was a scar in the earth, jagged and festering. Soldiers huddled, their eyes hollow, rifles trembling in hands that hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Fear wasn‚Äôt just a feeling here‚Äîit was a currency, traded in glances, in the twitch of a trigger finger. A private, barely 19, was whispering to himself, clutching a rosary like it could stop a bullet. *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs with us,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúKing and country.‚Äù* His mate, older, face caked in mud, laughed bitterly. **‚ÄúGod‚Äôs on leave, mate. And the king‚Äôs in a palace, not this shithole.‚Äù** I saw it before it happened. The private‚Äôs eyes darted to his mate, not with camaraderie but with terror‚Äîterror that the man next to him might crack, might turn the rifle inward. **Fratricide wasn‚Äôt a word here; it was a *reflex.* More men died in these trenches from their own side‚Äôs panic than from German shells.** A scream cut through the fog **someone had snapped, bayoneted his sergeant** for ordering another charge over the top. The officer‚Äôs blood mixed with the mud, and no one blinked. Patriotism? It was a fairy tale they told themselves to keep from eating their guns.I crouched, my head pounding harder now, the stone in my chest heavier. The dogs were gone, but their absence was louder than the artillery. They‚Äôd have known this was all bullshit‚Äîking, country, the whole scam. Dogs don‚Äôt salute flags or die for ideals. They just are. I envied them.

## Chapter 8: Project Sunshine:

The fracture flickered, and the trench dissolved. I was standing in San Francisco, 1950s, the air sharp with ocean salt and something else‚Äîsomething metallic, invisible, coating the streets like a ghost.
**Project Sunshine**
 The name sounded like a promise, but it was a lie. The government was dusting the city with radioactive particles, spraying **strontium-90 and cesium-137** to see how it spread, how it settled in lungs, in bones. Innocent people, kids eating ice cream, workers hauling crates‚Äîthey were all lab rats, and they didn‚Äôt even know it.I saw a woman in a diner, spooning oatmeal to her toddler. **Quaker Oats, laced with radioactive **calcium-45**, part of the same sick experiment
 The kid giggled, oblivious, as the mother smiled, proud of her all-American breakfast. I wanted to scream, to knock the bowl out of her hands, but my voice was gone. I was a ghost here, too, just like the radiation. The Royal Scam was in full swing: the government, waving the flag of progress, poisoned its own to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them from the Red Menace. Patriotism was a mask, and behind it, the war machine chewed through its own people.I thought of my mother, her fire-eyes, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** She‚Äôd have seen through this, too. She‚Äôd have burned the diner down before letting that kid eat another bite. But me?

## Chapter 9: The Snowden Loop:

The fracture yanked me again, and now I was in a server room, 2013, the hum of machines drowning out the world. Edward Snowden sat at a terminal, his fingers flying, leaking secrets that‚Äôd make the world scream. I wasn‚Äôt just watching him‚ÄîI was him. My hands were his, my paranoia his, my certainty that the truth was worth the exile. The NSA, the CIA, the whole alphabet soup of power‚Äîthey were the modern royalty, dressed in suits instead of crowns, claiming authority because they controlled the data, the narrative, the scam.But it wasn‚Äôt just them. It was Newton, codifying gravity while high as a kite, then preaching sober science. It was Ivar, drawing lines in the mud to claim victory, then betraying his allies. It was the generals in the trenches, sending boys to die for a flag they‚Äôd never touch. Every era, the same con: get to the truth first, bottle it, sell it, ban it.

## Chapter 10: Transmission Over:

**The dogs knew**. They always knew. That‚Äôs why they had to die.I stumbled out of Snowden‚Äôs body, my head... screaming! What the fuck is this? Every character, every moment, I was the private in the trench, killing his sergeant out of fear. I was the mother feeding her kid poisoned oatmeal, believing in the American Dream. I was Newton, chasing enlightenment in a haze of mercury. I was Ivar, plotting betrayal with a string. I was Snowden, burning my life to expose the truth. ~[ I was robbing a bank when I took a bullet to the skull.]~

### The bank‚Äôs alarms wailed.
 ~[ Blood in my face, stuck to my head, filling my mouth, left ear, and nostrils. I lost the choke and gag reflex. I lost all reflex.]~ I was dipping my head in warm bath water, getting cleaned up before I go lay down. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about civilization, and the archetypes it fosters. All while muttering ""Can‚Äôt they see the hypocrisy? How could they be unaware of the damage they are causing?""

The dogs were gone, but I could still smell bread and static... and copper.

> `#$%&` **END TRANSMISSION** `&%$#`
**""They think they understand. They? Them? Him? Her? I? You? They're mulling it over right now...""**

Have you ever heard a note lingering in the silence, faint but unyielding? Like a summons from some unseen conductor? It‚Äôs not a melody you know, nor a score you stumbled upon by chance. More like you were a restless instrument, untuned and wandering, until you found yourself playing the exact chord you were destined for. That‚Äôs how this symphony began.



I hadn‚Äôt played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her music.



How I wish it remained like that. Alas, she got diagnosed with cancer. Brain cancer‚Ä¶terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.



I couldn‚Äôt keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn‚Äôt get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.



Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn‚Äôt pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script‚Äî*Liam Goodpray*. No stamp, no return address.



The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must‚Äôve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire‚Äôs favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.



*‚ÄúTo Mr. Liam Goodpray,*



*You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital*



*Pay: $50,000 cash*



*Mr. Wellers awaits you.‚Äù*



Just that offer was written, by a name I‚Äôve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Fifty grand in cash? For a single performance? It had to be some sort of trick or scam. But there was nothing there except an address. Would I go there and just get carjacked or something?¬†



I‚Äôll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn‚Äôt decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.



I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.



She was playing something I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.



She simply looked at me and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go.‚Äù No fear or worry, just pleading.



I woke up shaking, and there, laid on my nightstand, was the letter.



I did my daily morning routine and jumped into my car. After that dream, I just wanted to see Dorset Hollow, despite Claire‚Äôs pleas. I wasn‚Äôt going to perform or even touch that piano, I just wanted to see. At least that‚Äôs what I told myself.



The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn‚Äôt want to be followed.



The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.



*‚ÄúDorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection‚Äù*



The town looked preserved. It wasn‚Äôt old, wasn‚Äôt abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn‚Äôt see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.



Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said *DIN(N)ER*. Clever. I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day, so I pulled in.



The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren‚Äôt startled or surprised, just..aware.



I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.



‚ÄúYou headed to the concert hall?‚Äù she asked as she handed me the menu.



‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know?‚Äù I said, wondering what made it obvious.



She shrugged and looked in some general direction. ‚ÄúNot many folks come by here unless they‚Äôve been invited.‚Äù



I told her my order but she didn‚Äôt write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.



The young man looked at me from his booth. ‚ÄúYou play?‚Äù



I hesitated a bit before answering, ‚Äúused to.‚Äù



He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good enough for Bellmare.‚Äù



I forced a smile at him. ‚ÄúYou been?‚Äù



But he didn‚Äôt answer. Just went back to staring at his food.



I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs covered,‚Äù she said.



‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù



She just gave a small shrug and said, ‚ÄúMr. Wellers takes care of his guests.‚Äù



‚ÄúNice guy‚Äù, I thought to myself, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn‚Äôt fit the town‚Äîtoo big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.



Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.



‚ÄúMr. Goodpray,‚Äù he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. ‚ÄúMr. Wellers welcomes you.‚Äù



His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn‚Äôt reach his eyes.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Mr. Wellers?‚Äù



He nodded. ‚ÄúSome call me that.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs that what *you* call you?‚Äù



He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. ‚ÄúMr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.‚Äù¬†



That didn‚Äôt answer anything, but I let it go.



‚ÄúThe folks at the diner said you covered my meal,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúWellers takes care of his guests,‚Äù he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. ‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù



As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.



You know that show *Dr. Who*? The hall was like the TARDIS. Massive. Bigger than it should be, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waiting for centuries to perform.



It wasn‚Äôt Claire‚Äôs piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.



I stepped toward it slowly.¬†



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a piece of beauty,‚Äù Wellers said behind me. ‚ÄúSpecially made for this hall.‚Äù



‚ÄúShe looks‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused, searching for the right word. ‚ÄúHungry.‚Äù



He chuckled softly. ‚ÄúMusic‚Äôs always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.‚Äù



There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.



I turned to face him. ‚ÄúYou sound like you‚Äôre giving a eulogy.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù he said, smooth as ever.



I blinked. That struck me wrong.



‚ÄúYou.. usually refer to yourself in the third person,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut just this moment, you didn't.""



He paused, then smiled and said, ‚ÄúMr. Wellers finds it‚Ä¶easier that way. Keeps things separate.‚Äù



I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow‚Äù



‚ÄúYou sure? It doesn‚Äôt look like anyone usually comes.‚Äù I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it‚Ä¶there was nothing there.

1lt81jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lt81jo/my_roomate_keeps_quoting_horror_movies/,My roomate keeps quoting horror movies,"(Part one)

It started a month ago if I remember right. With the lack of sleep I've been getting, it's hard to recall exactly when Michael started doing this weird shit. I've talked about moving dorms, but they say it's too late in the semester. I can't go back home either, Mom and I aren't on talking terms right now. So, locked in my room, and with no one else to really contact, I decided that maybe the strangers on the internet might be of some assistance, and if not assistance, at least some acknowledgement of my problem. 

For context, Michael and I share a dorm. We are cordial enough but besides our shared love for horror movies, we are polar opposites. He is studying to be a paramedic, swims in his spare time, and avoids alcohol like the plague. I, on the other hand, am failing my civil engineering course, and my exercise consists of a near daily staggering home from the student bar.  At first, we flat out ignored each other, confining ourselves to our separate rooms, genuinely surprised to see one another when we did bump into one another. For months this was simply the undiscussed, but nonetheless accepted way of life. That was until one day, around midday, when I, like some hungover, dehydrated Gollum, ventured painfully into the kitchen in search of a.) sustenance b.)something to help me sleep, and c.) whatever the hell was making that ungodly noise at such an unreasonably early morning.  The former quests were impossible, the latter was obvious as soon as I walked into the common room area. Michael, as well as a skinny, half-dressed, cackling girl, were watching the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The girl did a false scream when Leatherface appeared on screen (he wasn't actually doing anything might I add, he was just there) using it as an excuse to be pulled closer to Michael, who did so without pulling his eyes from the screen. 

It must have been the loud flops of my slippers, maybe it was the disappointed groans of my fragile mind and soul. Either way, the girl turned and spoke with a tone of alarm.

""Who's that?""

God, the way her large lips smacked together as she asked this drove me insane. Managing to not contort my face into one of disgust, I answered politely ""Hi, Michael and I share the dorm. I'm Mark"" I gave a pitiful wave.

Michael finally turned his head from he screen. ""Oh yeah babe, this is Mark. Mark, this is Cathy.""

""Nice to meet you Cathy""

Before she replied, Mark chirped ""Did you ever watch this movie man? It's the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre""

Despite my head beating like a drum I entertained the conversation ""Yeah. It doesn't hold a candle to the original though""

""Really?"" Mark thought for a second ""Man we should watch it later, see if we agree on your hot take""

Taken back by his sudden friendliness,""I'll see how I feel later man, I'm gonna go and nurse this hangover for a while.""

""No problem, let me know if you're up for it""

I retreated to my dark room, and cocooning myself within the blankets, I shortly fell back to sleep. I hadn't heard a thing, didn't hear Cathy leave, did hear Michael on the phone, didn't even hear him open the door and collect the Door Dash order he made. It was only when Michael had rapped on my bedroom door that I woke up, my tongue feeling like a dried slug in my mouth. 

""Hey man"" Michael spoke quietly

""Hey"" I answered wondering what the hell was going on.

""The movie is ready to go, I got us some Door Dash too, I hope Pepperoni and cheese is good? I wasn't sure what you liked""

The idea of a pizza, the very notion of the concept was enough to get me out of bed, and before long, the two of us were in the common room, watching Gunnar Hansen swing a hammer at William Vail's head. Mark's eyes were glued the screen, as I half watched the scene, my attention stolen by the onion rings he had also ordered.

""It is way more impactful""

""What?"" I spoke through my chewing.

""Like the way he kills these kids, in the remake it was so theatrical and gory. This seems so raw and brutal in its simplicity""

The language he used took me back slightly. I had thought of Michael as a guy who, beyond his subject area, had very little intelligence (Before you judge, you can get dumb paramedics too).

""Eh. Yeah. I think it's just better filmmaking""

""I agree man"" He leaned in for another slice of pizza, before reclining into the couch. 

When the film finally came to a close and Sally, bathed in blood and panic, escaped into the Texan sunset, when Mark spoke again. ""Shit man, that blew the remake out of the water""

""Yeah a far better film"" I agreed.

""Definitely made it to my top five""

My curiosity was peaked, did we find common ground? ""What's the top five?""

""Well"" he scrunched his face in thought ""At number five is the original Scream"" he thought for a second ""then I'll give it to Jason vs. Freddie, the original Halloween"" he paused once more ""and having seen this, I'll give it the number two spot, and my top pick is Chucky""

""Dude"" I said with genuine disbelief ""Chucky is your top pick?""

""Yeah"" he chuckled ""What's wrong with that?""

""Man it's not a bad film, but that's like saying the lettuce is the best part of the burger, an essential part, but by no means the best part""

""Well"" his face wearing a genuine look of intrigue ""What's your top five?""

I thought for a moment. I was never asked this question, so answering off the cuff, I replied: ""Number five is the original Halloween""

At this Mark put his hands up with a smile. I continued ""Next is The Exorcist, *then* The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, and at my number one HAS to John Carpenter's The Thing"" 

For a moment he nodded with a smile, obviously impressed. ""Dude, I'll be honest I've heard of them, but I've barely watched any of them.""

""Seriously?""

""Seriously""

""Man, you *are* missing out""

""Hey"" he looked at me in the eye, a friendly spark therein ""We'll do this again next week. You pick the film, the following week I'll pick it""

I contemplated the idea as I looked at the empty pizza box, the half drank bottle of Pepsi, and the three onion rings in the bag on the table. I had genuinely enjoyed the evening, and looking at Michael's anticipating face, I seen he was equally glad to have discovered common ground.

""Yeah man"" I slapped his shoulder awkwardly ""I'll buy next week's food""

""Brilliant"" he spoke quicker than he had been ""any idea on the film you're going to pick?""

Admittedly, I was taken aback, but ultimately I was just glad that two guys who were living in the same space finally had something to talk about. ""Eh"" I thought, before shrugging ""Maybe the Exorcist?""

The words hardly got out of my mouth before Michael replied ""Sounds good, Mark""

I was taken aback, and frankly had begun to find this enthusiasm weird. ""Yeah. Anyway, I'll clean up here, and retire to mine chambers"" I spoke in a terrible British accent ""Tis getting rather late as it is young squire""

""nah man, don't worry. You go on. You're still fragile. I'll clean up. You can order, pay, and clean up the food next week. Deal?""

Shocked, but eager to get to bed, I nodded ""Sure man"".

And that's how it started. Every week, like clockwork. Cathy would spend all day with Michael, and when she left, we'd order food, and take it turns to choose the film. Mark didn't think much of The Exorcist. The following week I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Event Horizon. The week after Mark fell in love with Jacob's Ladder. The next week I suffered through Bride of Chucky. For weeks this continued, it became so common that even the Door Dash guy began to ask us what horror movie we were watching this week. 

It brought us closer, and soon we became friends. However, like I said the weird shit didn't start till like a month ago. It was my go to choose a film, and I decided to choose the Poughkeepsie Tapes. It was that same night we had ordered Indian. As we watched the movie, I couldn't help but notice exactly *how* Michael watched the film. He sat upright, his back as straight as an arrow. Like an attentive student. It was during the final scenes, the one where Cheryl Dempsey is giving the interview, that I began to get really uncomfortable. It wasn't by Michael, don't mistake me, just the scene itself always made my skin crawl, like there was worms beneath my skin, and scanning my brain for the most masculine excuse I could think of, I concocted the single most brilliant line known to man:

""Imma head for a piss""

Michael nodded in acknowledgment, his eyes never leaving the screen. 

I got up quickly, but as I did stood up, I managed to bang my shin against the small coffee table that sat in front of the couch, sending the remnants of the chicken jalfrezi that had been dangerously balancing on the far edge of the table, tumbling to the ground. It's content spreading wide like brown Rorschach against the pine floorboards.

""Shit"" I stood still ""I'll clean it up in a second.""

Michael's eyes, once again, remained stuck upon the screen. ""That's okay man""

I went to the bathroom for the piss I didn't need, and returning, I went straight to the kitchen. By the time I had collected enough kitchen roll, and had begun to wipe the mess I had made from the floor, the credits had begun to run. 

As if coming out of a trance, Michael shook his head slightly, and as if noticing me for the first time he asked, with a slight anger, ""What happened here?""

I looked up from my position on the floor, and scoffing ""Applying for my masters, Mikey""

""What's your name?"" Michael rose from the seat. His tall, broad frame looking intimidating in the sole light of the TV.

""What?"" I laughed nervously.

He came closer.

""What is your name?"" He spoke louder.

I looked down and kept cleaning ""My name is bigdick69, I'm a good friend of your mother's"" I laughed, expecting that our newly forged friendship, could enjoy the fun that such remarks might bring.

""Wrong"" he came closer again, a slight smile on his face. ""You're name is...Slave""

I stopped cleaning, and leaning back so that my ass rested on my calves answered ""What?""

""YOUR NAME IS SLAAAAAVVVEEE"""" He shouted.

I felt in immediate danger. He was towering above me, and I doubt I could fight him off should he decide to hurt me. My heart began to thump in my ears, and slowly getting to my feet, my eyes following his, and his following mine, I spoke quietly, as I backed away ""Man the neighbors will lose their shit, keep your voice down.

He began to laugh, his intimidating stance melted away, and he approached me in a relaxed fashion throwing and arm around me before getting me to a nuggie position. ""Dude I'm just quoting the film"" His chuckle seemed genuine ""You shit yourself.""

My heart suddenly became light, and with relieved laugh I answered ""You shouldn't do that when a man is eating Indian, I might have painted the couch a fine shade of brown""

He ruffled my hair and with a chuckle ""Never though of that"" he put his hands on his hips ""Anyway, you sure you don't mind cleaning this up? I'd help but I got to go to bed, Cathy has organized a camping trip and I got to leave early in the morning""

""Yeah, sure""

""Thanks man. Fucked up movie bro, I think it might even be better than Chucky""

""Anything is better than that man""

He laughed, before leaving for his room.

I cleaned the mess, and IMMEADIATELY went to my bedroom and locked the door. I've seen one to many films for this shit to work. Since then, I've locked my bedroom door every night, even as I write this, it is locked, he has gotten weirder since that first instance. Quoting different horror films throughout the day, even Cathy has texted me asking me about his behavior, she doesn't know half of the stuff I've witnessed.  Can anyone here recommend what I do next?

## Chapter 1: The Weight of Silence:

The dogs died.Every last one.Not just animals, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers ‚Äî beings who never barked or bit, only understood.

When they were gone, it felt like the universe itself lost a breath. I carried that loss inside me like a stone in my chest.

My mother had fire in her eyes ‚Äî not calm, but fierce. She didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it. ‚ÄúThis is the way it is,‚Äù she said once, voice sharp as broken glass. **‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe me, go fucking find out.‚Äù**
No comfort. No softness. Just raw truth. For her ‚Äî and for me ‚Äî depression wasn‚Äôt sadness.
It was hopelessness.
Not because I doubted the future. I knew, deep down, that things would get better. Far beyond my time, the stars would shine brighter. Life would flourish. But knowing that didn‚Äôt help. It was hard to build energy on a future I can't immediately touch.

Maybe I‚Äôd just kill myself‚Ä¶ hibernate a little while before reincarnation. Wait for the Universe to catch up.
Mom tried shooting herself when I was little. It only made her more scary. A .45 lodged in her cerebellum didn‚Äôt do suit, but give her a mythos.

The present felt wrong, a vast clusterfuck that swallowed meaning whole. I closed my eyes: grief, anger, sadness, and knowledge of a greater stage being set, for future for everyone simultaneously converged into 100 different perceptions of myself. And then‚Äîsomething broke open.

A fracture in time and space appeared, glowing faint and sharp. Paths to slip through.
This is new...

**Dogs... My Shadow**

Back home, we lived with them‚Äînot as pets, but as partners, teachers, comedians, healers. They didn‚Äôt bark. They didn‚Äôt bite.
They understood.

I perceived myself in an alley behind a bakery in Lincolnshire, 17th century Earth.
My perceptions converged into 1.
No one noticed but the dog.The Dog?!?
The dog looked at me.
Not past me. Not through me. At me.
My tail started wagging.
(Metaphorically. Not innuendosly... yet.)

She was a street mutt, a professional beggar, and swindler of hearts. I threw my arms around her and spoke in twelve frequencies of puppy voice. She smelled like **bread and static.** I made every facial expression. Ever.

That‚Äôs when Isaac Newton saw me.
He stood at the edge of the alley holding a satchel full of lemons and ink-stained papers. His wig was crooked. His pupils were wide. He watched me kiss the dog, dance, and repeat *'Who's a fucking good girl?""* A million times. **He's a voyer. I'll soon learn it's an English kink. So is dressing up in regalia and threatening violence... weird as fucks.** **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from here,‚Äù** he said, flatly. I blinked, ears twitching. **‚ÄúHere is relative.‚Äù** He smirked.
*‚ÄúI‚Äôve been awake for... days?‚Äù* he said, **‚ÄúI've been feeling like the weight of the world has been holding me down lately, so I retaliate by working on perfecting my tincture. I hallucinated an angel yesterday. I named her Hypothesis.‚Äù** He knelt down and scratched the dog behind her ear. She sneezed.
**‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he said, staring at me now, **‚Äúare either a messenger or a maniac. I remember you from my vision I will have in the future.‚Äù**
*""This man knows how to phase-lock...""* I thought to myself.
His nose, eyes, and autonomous identity reminded me of a childhood friend... **""Don't bring up the past.""** I jestered.
**And so I did.**

He Invited me to Woolsthorpe Manor, a crooked house full of books, mercury, dried herbs, unwashed cups, and dreams that smelled like fire.

## Chapter 3: Fucking Wizards:
I came to Earth to find dogs.
Instead I found a wizard high on theology , opium, sassafras bark, roots, fungi, and a synthetic caffeinoid with enough benzyne rings to cause another Big Bang.
He didn‚Äôt ask me where I came from.
Only why I hadn‚Äôt sooner.
If I would‚Äôve known my capability, and the stimulants awaiting for me, I would have.

So, yeah. I found the Canid genome I yearned for. Except it wasn't a Canid, or a genome. It was the fucking will, the want, the direction, and the strategy of an attrition specialist.
Newton called it **‚ÄúThe Solution.‚Äù**
I called it a goddamn rapture in a bottle.

I was caught off guard by the gravity of the effect on me. Suicide disappeared as an option. Ideas of fixing, defining, and writing music about all that was will and could be became my self appointed purpose. Granted by the divine right of fiends. I see all patterns like a **polymath(a word for someone with no education of formulas, so they articulate with what they are familiar with)** An abstract thinker who articulates with geometric-trigenometry without knowledge of Hilbert, or Vector spaces. E.g. me. **""Orthogonal?"" ""Sine wave from A to B, you mean."" ""Koche Vector?"" ""You mean Tangent X pi.""**
Newton and I claimed ourselves the greatest mathematical visionists. I defined a solitonic wave bottlenecking down a trunctuating canal that becomes a spout. I explained how intuitive it was to see the solitons layered kinetic energy exiting the spout way faster than brute pressure would. Then he explained to me in words not yet invented, how a bucket full of water, swung in a circle described everything if you measure the volume, weight, speed, and arc.

He told me it was to ‚Äúcalibrate perception.‚Äù
That‚Äôs wizard-speak for: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get high and talk about numbers, and patterns until we have to use letters. ‚Äù

And it worked.

We sat up night after night, cracked out on enlightenment, discussing whether time was a function of emergence, information, relation, or imagination. We were deep in contemplation.

He insisted gravity was empathy.
I told him, no ‚Äî it was just mass looking for a mirror. Empathy... Reflection..

## Chapter 4: The Heathens:

I woke up in a mud-slick field outside of Yorkshire. Ivar the Boneless drawing boundaries with a string. The Anglos realizing they've been tricked by words, but they honor their word anyway. This is definitely *pre-Agincourt.*
Leather, wool, axes, and fucking huge bows!?! Who made those bows so big and why? Look at the shoulders on the archers! Jesus Christ!
Look at the shoulders of the Danes!
People evolve fast to rowing and bowing apparently.
They are all nervous. **ALL OF THEM.** Factions on both sides are planning on attacking their current allies when this war is over. They are all pole positioning. If they don't, they don't stand a chance in this cutthroat catwalk.
The mud sucked at my boots, cold and greedy, as I stood in the Yorkshire field. Ivar the Boneless was still there, pacing with his string, marking boundaries like a spider weaving a web. His eyes glinted, not with malice but with hunger‚Äîa hunger for control, for legacy, for something to outlast the blood about to soak this earth. The Anglo archers, their shoulders carved from years of pulling monstrous bows, eyed the Danes with a mix of respect and dread. The Danes, broad as oaks, gripped axes and shields, their breaths steaming in the dawn chill. Everyone was posturing, planning betrayals before the first arrow flew.I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. Or maybe I was. The fracture in time‚Äîthat faint, sharp glow I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîpulsed in the corner of my vision, a crack in the world‚Äôs skin. The dog was gone, but her scent lingered, **bread and static,** tethering me to something real. I closed my eyes, and the hundred perceptions of myself flickered: Osiris, Lucifer, Jesus, the street mutt, Newton‚Äôs angel Hypothesis, and now‚Ä¶ what? A witness? A warrior? A ghost?Ivar noticed me. His limp was pronounced, but his presence was a blade, cutting through the fog. **‚ÄúYou,‚Äù** he rasped, pointing with a calloused finger. **‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no Anglo. No Dane. What are you, skald, to stand here unmarked?‚Äù** I smirked, echoing Newton‚Äôs crooked grin from centuries later. **‚ÄúHere is relative,‚Äù** I said. His laugh was a bark, short and sharp, like the dogs I‚Äôd lost.‚ÄúYou speak in riddles,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. **‚ÄúGood. Riddles keep men alive when steel fails.‚Äù** He handed me the string he‚Äôd been using to mark the field. It was coarse, stained with dirt and blood. **‚ÄúMeasure the world, stranger. Tell me what you see.‚Äù** I took the string, feeling its weight‚Äînot just physical, but something heavier, like the stone in my chest after the dogs died. I stretched it taut, mimicking his movements, and the battlefield seemed to shift. The lines I drew weren‚Äôt just boundaries; they were equations, patterns, the same solitonic waves I‚Äôd described to Newton. The archers‚Äô bows, the Danes‚Äô axes, the nervous glances‚Äîthey were all vectors, forces, arcs of intent spiraling toward collision. **‚ÄúWar‚Äôs a function,‚Äù I muttered, half to Ivar, half to myself. ‚ÄúMass looking for a mirror.‚Äù** He squinted, not understanding but intrigued. **‚ÄúYou sound like a sei√∞ma√∞r, a sorcerer. Speak plain, or I‚Äôll gut you.‚Äù** I laughed, reckless. **‚ÄúGravity‚Äôs empathy, Ivar. You pull men to you, and they pull back. Betrayal‚Äôs just the reflection of trust. Same shit, different lingo.‚Äù** His grin was feral now. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do, stranger. Stay close. The bows will sing soon, and I want your eyes on the slaughter.‚Äù* The fracture glowed brighter, and I felt it calling. Not just a crack, but a door. I could slip through, back to Newton‚Äôs manor, back to the dogs, forward to a future where the stars burned brighter. But I stayed. The mud, the string, the weight of Ivar‚Äôs gaze‚Äîthey grounded me. I wasn‚Äôt ready to leave this moment, this convergence of chaos and clarity.The first arrow flew, a high whine cutting the air. The bowstring‚Äôs song was a soliton, a wave carrying kinetic energy faster than brute force. I saw it all: the arc, the speed, the volume of death in motion.
Ivar made his way to me. **""Glory is yours to take. You are wise enough to lead a flank up the hill, so we can go back and cut around their backs. We're leaving a skeleton crew to hit and run to fake a full army. Valhalla is calling your name.""**
I couldn't hold the stoic expression. *""Fuck you Dickless!""* I grabbed his head and forced my knee into it. He had a hard head, and was vaccinated against headblows.
He knew exactly why I did it. And he didn't try to deny leading me as bait to draw all of his enemies to kill each other without him lifting a finger. **Odysseus of Ragnorok.**

## Chapter 5: Einstein‚Äôs Kitchen and Other Drug-Fueled Mysteries of the Cosmos:

The fracture in time spat me out into a cramped Munich kitchen, 1905, the air thick with the tang of burnt coffee and something sharper **Pervitin** **methamphetamine** buzz humming through Albert Einstein‚Äôs veins like a cosmic telegraph. The room was a chaos of domesticity and madness: chipped porcelain cups stacked in a sink, a half-eaten loaf of rye bread on a scarred wooden table, papers scrawled with equations spilling onto the floor like a drunk‚Äôs confession. A gas lamp flickered, casting shadows that danced like the equations themselves, curling and bending in defiance of Euclidean order. Einstein paced, his hair already a wild halo, his shirt untucked, eyes wide with the manic glow of a man who‚Äôd seen the universe‚Äôs blueprint and couldn‚Äôt unsee it.His wife, Mileva Mariƒá, stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes with a ferocity that could‚Äôve scoured the stars. Her dark hair was pinned up, but strands escaped, framing a face tight with exhaustion. **‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have the space or the time to do this,‚Äù** she muttered, her voice a low blade, cutting through the clatter of porcelain. I froze, leaning against a wall that smelled of damp plaster and regret. *‚ÄúDid you just‚Äî?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she snapped, not looking up. ‚ÄúI fucking did.‚Äù* Her words were a spark in the haze, a reminder that even in 1905, the human condition was raw, unfiltered, pissed off. Mileva wasn‚Äôt just washing dishes‚Äîshe was washing away the weight of being Einstein‚Äôs shadow, the mathematician whose own brilliance was buried under his. I felt it, the stone in my chest, the same one I carried since the dogs died. She was me, too‚Äîtrapped in a role she didn‚Äôt choose, raging against a world that didn‚Äôt see her.Einstein didn‚Äôt laugh at her outburst. He was too deep in his own orbit, pacing a groove into the linoleum, muttering about spacetime like it was a lover who‚Äôd betrayed him. He clutched a vial of Pervitin tablets, popping another like it was candy, his fingers trembling with the chemical courage that fueled his annus mirabilis. *‚ÄúSpacetime curves because it feels,‚Äù* he said, half to me, half to the void. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not math‚Äîit‚Äôs emotion, stretched across infinity.‚ÄùI smirked, my head throbbing with a concussion like pulse, the fracture‚Äôs glow flickering in the corner of my vision. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying the universe is depressed?‚Äù* He stopped, looked at me‚Äîreally looked, like the dog in Lincolnshire had, not past me but at me. **‚ÄúDepression‚Äôs just truth with no place to go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGenius is just depression with a better PR team.‚ÄùI nodded, the stone in my chest shifting. ‚ÄúYeah. Or finding a formula that describes all of existence, but your own.‚Äù** I knew that formula‚Äîmine, from the dogs‚Äô death, from my mother‚Äôs fire-eyes and her .45 mythos; his, from wrestling a universe that refused to stay still. We were both psychonauts, high on our own damage, chasing truths that burned.We sat at the table, the rye bread between us like a sacrament. Mileva kept scrubbing, her silence louder than the equations. I told Einstein about the dogs‚Äînot pets, but partners, teachers, comedians, healers. How their absence was a hole in the cosmos, a loss that made the stars dim. He listened, his Pervitin-sharpened eyes softening, and told me about his son, Hans Albert, barely a year old, sleeping in the next room. ‚ÄúI see him, and I see time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot clocks, but‚Ä¶ weight. The weight of what I‚Äôll leave him.‚ÄùI thought of my mother, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** Einstein‚Äôs weight was hers, mine, the dogs‚Äô. It was the weight of knowing too much and feeling too little, of being unbearably conscious in a world that demanded blindness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tired of being called a genius,‚Äù I said, not a question.He laughed, and analyzed. *‚ÄúGenius is a cage. They‚Äôll build bombs with my math, you know. They‚Äôll call it progress.‚Äù* His words hit like a shell in the trenches I‚Äôd seen, where patriotism justified fratricide. **The Royal Scam was already forming‚ÄîEinstein‚Äôs drug-fueled revelations would become relativity, then atomic bombs, then a world???**

## Chapter 6: Paradoxes and Psychonauts: (Expanded Transition)

The kitchen blurred, the fracture pulling me deeper into the haze. Einstein and I ranted, our words spilling like his papers, chaotic and true. We tweaked on Pervitin‚Äôs edge, the drug sharpening our edges until we were knives cutting through reality. Einstein leaned back, his chair creaking, and said, ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs a loaf of bread. I live in the slice labeled 1905, but I feel crumbs from all of it‚Äîpast, future, all at once.‚Äù **I asked if God played dice. He grinned, eyes glinting like the fracture. ‚ÄúMaybe. But He loads them.‚Äù** We laughed, then cried, tears hot with the weight of knowing the universe was a rigged game. We popped more Pervitin, recited Rilke‚Äôs Duino Elegies‚Äîlines about angels and terror‚Äîuntil we forgot what species we were, what century we were in

## Chapter 7: God, King, and Country:

The bowstring‚Äôs song faded, replaced by a wet, choking stench‚Äîtrenches, 1916, somewhere near the Somme. The air was thick with cordite and fear-sweat, **the kind that makes men kill their own before the enemy gets a chance**. I stumbled through the muck, boots sinking. The fracture in time had spit me out here, and the glowing crack in reality pulsed behind me, a taunting exit I couldn‚Äôt take. Not yet.The trench was a scar in the earth, jagged and festering. Soldiers huddled, their eyes hollow, rifles trembling in hands that hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Fear wasn‚Äôt just a feeling here‚Äîit was a currency, traded in glances, in the twitch of a trigger finger. A private, barely 19, was whispering to himself, clutching a rosary like it could stop a bullet. *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs with us,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúKing and country.‚Äù* His mate, older, face caked in mud, laughed bitterly. **‚ÄúGod‚Äôs on leave, mate. And the king‚Äôs in a palace, not this shithole.‚Äù** I saw it before it happened. The private‚Äôs eyes darted to his mate, not with camaraderie but with terror‚Äîterror that the man next to him might crack, might turn the rifle inward. **Fratricide wasn‚Äôt a word here; it was a *reflex.* More men died in these trenches from their own side‚Äôs panic than from German shells.** A scream cut through the fog **someone had snapped, bayoneted his sergeant** for ordering another charge over the top. The officer‚Äôs blood mixed with the mud, and no one blinked. Patriotism? It was a fairy tale they told themselves to keep from eating their guns.I crouched, my head pounding harder now, the stone in my chest heavier. The dogs were gone, but their absence was louder than the artillery. They‚Äôd have known this was all bullshit‚Äîking, country, the whole scam. Dogs don‚Äôt salute flags or die for ideals. They just are. I envied them.

## Chapter 8: Project Sunshine:

The fracture flickered, and the trench dissolved. I was standing in San Francisco, 1950s, the air sharp with ocean salt and something else‚Äîsomething metallic, invisible, coating the streets like a ghost.
**Project Sunshine**
 The name sounded like a promise, but it was a lie. The government was dusting the city with radioactive particles, spraying **strontium-90 and cesium-137** to see how it spread, how it settled in lungs, in bones. Innocent people, kids eating ice cream, workers hauling crates‚Äîthey were all lab rats, and they didn‚Äôt even know it.I saw a woman in a diner, spooning oatmeal to her toddler. **Quaker Oats, laced with radioactive **calcium-45**, part of the same sick experiment
 The kid giggled, oblivious, as the mother smiled, proud of her all-American breakfast. I wanted to scream, to knock the bowl out of her hands, but my voice was gone. I was a ghost here, too, just like the radiation. The Royal Scam was in full swing: the government, waving the flag of progress, poisoned its own to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them from the Red Menace. Patriotism was a mask, and behind it, the war machine chewed through its own people.I thought of my mother, her fire-eyes, her voice like broken glass: **‚ÄúThis is the way it is. Go fucking find out.‚Äù** She‚Äôd have seen through this, too. She‚Äôd have burned the diner down before letting that kid eat another bite. But me?

## Chapter 9: The Snowden Loop:

The fracture yanked me again, and now I was in a server room, 2013, the hum of machines drowning out the world. Edward Snowden sat at a terminal, his fingers flying, leaking secrets that‚Äôd make the world scream. I wasn‚Äôt just watching him‚ÄîI was him. My hands were his, my paranoia his, my certainty that the truth was worth the exile. The NSA, the CIA, the whole alphabet soup of power‚Äîthey were the modern royalty, dressed in suits instead of crowns, claiming authority because they controlled the data, the narrative, the scam.But it wasn‚Äôt just them. It was Newton, codifying gravity while high as a kite, then preaching sober science. It was Ivar, drawing lines in the mud to claim victory, then betraying his allies. It was the generals in the trenches, sending boys to die for a flag they‚Äôd never touch. Every era, the same con: get to the truth first, bottle it, sell it, ban it.

## Chapter 10: Transmission Over:

**The dogs knew**. They always knew. That‚Äôs why they had to die.I stumbled out of Snowden‚Äôs body, my head... screaming! What the fuck is this? Every character, every moment, I was the private in the trench, killing his sergeant out of fear. I was the mother feeding her kid poisoned oatmeal, believing in the American Dream. I was Newton, chasing enlightenment in a haze of mercury. I was Ivar, plotting betrayal with a string. I was Snowden, burning my life to expose the truth. ~[ I was robbing a bank when I took a bullet to the skull.]~

### The bank‚Äôs alarms wailed.

The dogs were gone, but I could still smell bread and static... and copper.

1lt7zt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lt7zt1/shark_hz702_ultralight_cleaning_heavyweight/,"Shark HZ702: Ultralight Cleaning, Heavyweight Performance?","My apartment's a disaster zone, mostly due to my two fluffy cats.  Shedding is a constant battle, and crumbs are basically a form of miniature land art.  I needed a lightweight, easy-to-use stick vacuum that wouldn't break the bank, so I picked up the [Shark HZ702 Ultralight Stick Vacuum](https://amzn.to/3IdSn7U) to test its mettle.  I used it daily for a month, tackling everything from pet hair to spilled coffee (don't judge).

## Cleaning Performance

The Shark HZ702 surprised me.  Its suction power is impressive for such a lightweight machine. It easily picks up pet hair from carpets and rugs‚Äîmy cats' shedding apocalypse was significantly reduced.  Hard floors are a breeze, and I even managed to suck up surprisingly large debris with minimal effort.  The crevice tool is handy for reaching corners and tight spaces, although I did find it a little fiddly to attach sometimes.  However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for deeply embedded dirt in heavy carpets.  It shines on quick clean-ups and everyday messes.

## Maneuverability & Ease of Use

This vacuum's name is no lie; it's truly ultralight.  Maneuvering it around furniture is effortless, a stark contrast to the bulky, cumbersome vacuums I've struggled with in the past.  It pivots easily, and the cordless design allows for complete freedom of movement. Even reaching under my sofa and cleaning high shelves was surprisingly simple. The controls are intuitive and easy to understand.

## Battery Life

The battery life is adequate for a small apartment, lasting around 20-25 minutes on a full charge. This is more than enough time to clean my entire place, though it could be slightly longer for larger homes. The charging time is relatively quick, too; it‚Äôs fully charged within a couple of hours.  However, if you have a very large home you may need to take into consideration having to recharge it mid-clean.

## Dustbin & Maintenance

Emptying the dustbin is a simple and clean process; there's no messy cloud of dust to contend with. The filter is also easily removable and washable, making maintenance straightforward. I found the overall maintenance process quick and easy, making it suitable for those who may not want to spend large amounts of time on vacuum maintenance.

## Noise Level

It‚Äôs relatively quiet compared to other stick vacuums I‚Äôve used. While not silent, the noise level is manageable and doesn't disrupt conversations or my work.  It's certainly not ear-splitting, which is a big plus for apartment living.

## Value

At $170, the Shark HZ702 offers exceptional value.  Compared to other stick vacuums in this price range (and even some higher-priced models), its performance and ease of use are hard to beat. Most rivals either lack the same level of suction, are cumbersome to maneuver, or have significantly shorter battery lives.

## Weight and Storage

As its name suggests, it is indeed ultralight and easy to store.  The fact it stands upright on its own is incredibly convenient and saves a lot of space.

**Pros:**

* Lightweight and easy to maneuver
* Surprisingly powerful suction
* Easy to empty dustbin and maintain
* Relatively quiet operation
* Excellent value for the price

**Cons:**

* Battery life could be slightly longer
* Crevice tool attachment could be improved

**Value Proposition & Price Analysis:**

At $170, the Shark HZ702 is a steal.  Compared to similar stick vacuums from Dyson or other premium brands, which often cost twice as much, it offers remarkably similar cleaning performance.  While it may not have all the bells and whistles of a top-of-the-line model, it excels at its core function: efficiently and easily cleaning your floors.  This makes it a best-budget pick for those who value performance and convenience without needing advanced features.

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The Shark HZ702 Ultralight Stick Vacuum exceeded my expectations. It‚Äôs a powerful, lightweight, and easy-to-use vacuum that‚Äôs perfect for small to medium-sized homes, especially those with pets.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great value stick vacuum without breaking the bank.",1,1751825739.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False
1lt7znf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1lt7znf/i_awake_late_on_sundays_so_dont_take_my_meds_any/,I awake late on Sundays so don't take my meds - any issues?,"I'm  approaching the end of two weeks of titration on 20mg of Elvanse. So far two Sundays I've got up late, after a caffeinated coffee to wake up and half to a full hour gap I would take the meds.. However, I get up about 10:30 to 11:00 on Sundays at times so I just think what the hell, take a day off. 

Are there any issues with that? Is it reducing the effects? I don't think Elvanse is cumulative in effects such that a day off could reduce effects. So I figure it'll help me prevent issues sleeping Sunday night or waking Monday at 5am.

Now I don't know how to restart the conversation.","I'm doing my college from a distance-learning program (classes only on Sundays). Last year, in my first year, I saw a girl on the very first day and felt something more than just attraction. At first, I thought it would fade away, but it didn‚Äôt.

One day, me and a friend pulled another guy from our class to sit with us, and that girl and her friend were sitting a little far. We felt like there was some eye contact.

Later, I found a number from the class group that had the same name as hers (but wasn‚Äôt actually her). My friend messaged that number, pretending to ask about study material. She replied, asking who we were. Then she said something like, ‚ÄúYou must be one of those three guys ‚Äî one who copies BTS style, and one who shows off his body (she meant me, I guess ‚Äî but I never try to show off). I don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù

Then my friend asked her out for coffee, she said yes, but he backed out. She blocked the number after that.

Later, I messaged that number again saying, ‚ÄúHello, gym boy u know.‚Äù And I got blocked instantly. That message was also sent because my friend told me to.

Then I decided to clear things face-to-face. But for a long time, she didn‚Äôt come to class. I messaged from another number saying sorry for everything. She replied, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send unnecessary messages.‚Äù

Then one day, I got the courage and asked her directly in person, ‚ÄúCan we talk for a minute?‚Äù She smiled slightly and said no.

Then during our exam day, I waited outside. When I saw her, I again asked, ‚ÄúCan we talk for a minute?‚Äù She agreed. I took her aside and said:

> ""Listen, from the start of college I just wanted to talk to you. My friend messaged you just for fun after he found out I liked you. And I‚Äôm really sorry for the messages I sent.""



But then she said, ‚ÄúI never got any messages.‚Äù I showed her the number. She said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my number.‚Äù

So I said, ‚ÄúOh! Then it was a misunderstanding.‚Äù

Before leaving, I told her again that I always wanted to talk to her, and that the message was mistakenly sent to another Aliya. She kindly smiled and replied: ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt talk.‚Äù

That was our first and only real conversation.

The truth is, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, or even a female friend. I don't know how to talk to girls, or how to even start. I really want to talk to her again, but I don‚Äôt know how.

What should I do now? Should I try again slowly? Or just let it go? Any advice from women would also really help.",1,1751825718.0,u_prince_siingh_,0,1.0,False
