\- Laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad P52

\- iGPU: Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Coffee Lake, PCI 0000:00:02.0)

\- dGPU: NVIDIA Quadro P1000 Mobile (GP107GLM, PCI 0000:01:00.0)

\- OS: Arch Linux (fully up to date as of 24 Nov 2025)

\- Kernel: 6.17.8-arch1-1 (also tested on 6.11 LTS – same behaviour)

\- WM: Hyprland v0.52.1 (git 967c3c74)

\- Display manager: SDDM  → Hyprland

\- Hyprland launched with NVIDIA as primary GPU (env vars + render offload when needed)



The problem:

After \`systemctl suspend\` (or closing the lid) and waking up:

\- External HDMI monitor works perfectly

\- Internal laptop panel eDP-1 stays completely black (backlight off, no image)

\- \`hyprctl monitors\` still shows eDP-1 as present and dpmsStatus: 1 (on)

→iGPU simply never gets runtime-resumed when NVIDIA is the primary renderer and works fine after suspend.



after suspend is resumed:



    /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/power/runtime_status
    suspended
    ~ ❯ echo 0001:00:02.0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/i915/unbind
    0000:00:02.0
    ~ ❯ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:01.0/power/runtime_status
    active



so intel GPU in still in suspended state and i do not understand how it can be fixed cause Nvidia GPU is fine and works



What I have already tried (none permanently fixed it):

\- nvidia-suspend/resume/override.conf with sleep 5-10 → no change

\- nvidia.NVreg\_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 → removed, tried both ways

\- nvidia\_drm.modeset=1 fbdev=1 → tried both on and off

\- Disabled all nvidia-suspend/hibernate/resume services

\- Switched to open kernel modules (nvidia-open-dkms) → broke nvidia-smi completely

\- Tried both proprietary 580.105.08 and open modules

\- BIOS set to Hybrid graphics (not discrete-only)

\- Tested launching Hyprland directly from TTY (no DM) → same black internal screen

\- Various systemd sleep hooks to rebind i915 → works but is a dirty workaround

\- Tried switching off SDDM



Relevant logs after broken resume (from TTY):

I am willing to test anything (hooks, kernel parameters, different driver combos, patches, etc.).

I just want a clean solution that survives suspend/resume without manual i915 rebind.

Please help – this is the last thing preventing me from daily-driving Hyprland on this laptop.

1p5utr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1p5utr6/pseudo_daughters/,Pseudo Daughters,Hi! I can't believe I am writing this mainly because I just realized that I think my mother is a Covert Narcissist maybe some traits either way - It has been a year almost since I had that aha moment. My mother has a savior thing going for her. I always thought aww she is so helpful and caring but now that she is not happy with me because I didn't go to her sister's second wedding in another country (how dare I) she has been going out of her way to try to make me feel... I am not even sure the word. Like she has friends that are close to my age and cousins that she will say wow they are amazing or get coffee with them or bring them along to hang out and never want to spend time with me. Or she will go out of her way to talk about how much she loves them or how great other kids are. This is literally just this tiny portion. I won't give you a whole life story. But I am wondering if anyone has experienced this. Honestly I feel often sad and have anxiety over it and feel like anyone she is close with hates me because of what she says about me but I swear this makes me sound paranoid. It would be things like how I was a difficult child or didn't like certain things or not respectful because I try to say no to something or I didn't like someone she likes. She gets really weird about people I am close to but everyone in her life is literally the MOST important and amazing thing. Thanks for listening. I feel petty writing this. It is just one little aspect that is so bewildering to me. The other stuff is obvious. Also these pseudo daughters that she takes under her wing are often from abusive household or had really bad childhoods and she is often says can you imagine wow she had it so bad. ,1,1764022169.0,NarcissisticMothers,0,1.0,False

I had a hard time during the newborn phase, but it slowly got better and better and just when I started to feel like I got my spark back, things went downhill. 

About a month ago, I started to have pain in my wrists- chalk in off to « mom wrists » because of repetitive movements over and over again. 

As the days went by, I started to develop pain and stiffness in all my main joints (ankles, knees, hips, elbows, shoulders and wrists). About a week ago, my joints started to swell. I’m in pain 24/7- taking ibuprofen to be semi fonctionnal and continue to be able to care for my baby. I have contacted my doctor- bloodwork is done and going in tomorrow for a check up. My anxiety has my spiraling- thinking of all the worst possible scenarios. I’m 28 y/o- I don’t understand why I’m so poorly. I feel trapped in a body that I don’t recognize. I hope I will get answers soon. 

I just feel so defeated and most of all, I feel so guilty. I have little to no energy (was already running on coffee and vibes because of sleep deprivation). I can’t really play on the floor with my son like I used to because of the pain and difficulty to get up afterwards. I feel like I’m failing him as a mom. It’s also been particularly difficult, because separation anxiety has come in full force and he always wants to be picked up/in my arms and has been more and more fussy- nights are also more difficult now than they were before. 

Don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this…maybe just to vent and get things off my chest. If you have words of encouragement, similar stories or advice on how I could handle day to day care despite the pain, I would be all ears. ❤️‍🩹

Welcome to Strixhaven!

\-------

Hello! I’m looking for a total of 10 players aged 21+ for 2 new Strixhaven campaigns, one on Tuesday evenings and one on Wednesday evenings! This has been one of my favorite campaigns to run, and I'm very excited to run it for more groups. This campaign is a slice-of-life campaign at a magical university, which makes it play quite different from a standard campaign, and I have a number of things I'm experimenting with in running it. I'm very open to changing things as we go based on feedback, and encourage everyone to share what they like, and what they don't like!

To clarify exactly what I mean by a slice-of-life campaign: While there's to some extent an overarching plot of the campaign, it's not something that comes up frequently, the main focus of the campaign is attending a magic university, making friends, and doing school things.

About Me as a DM:

My name is Morgan! I've been running campaigns for about 4 years now, but I am still trying new things out and learning as I go! I’m very open to constructive feedback and changing up the campaign to meet people's preferences and what you are/aren't enjoying.

Details:

The campaign runs from level 1 to level 10.The I’m looking for players aged 21+ who enjoy roleplaying!

My full player's guide can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10idosdt__W00NchAWZtgjmvWIJGmvZDytNXok-x5tPw) with a lot of details about my house rules and restrictions for the campaign, as well as details on what makes this campaign unusual.

*Pick 1: Cheap, Fast, Good

*Come in prepared with research and confidence.

*Cheap: leverage knowledge, document everything, walk if needed.

*Fast: pay for service and efficiency, set expectations early.

*Good: blend research with experience, build long-term relationships.

*Inspect the car, protect your leverage, get and verify contracts.

Good, fast, and cheap — pick one. Decide what matters most for your situation and build your strategy around that. If you want the best deal (“cheap”), don’t expect great service — think McDonald’s. We’re willing to accept sideways, smashed meat and cheese blobs as long as it’s $2.

If you want the perfect vehicle (“fast”), your options shrink. If I have the best burgers in town and seating is limited, I have every right to charge what I want. As the value of a person, product, or place increases, the money becomes less relevant.

If you want consistency (“good”), think chain restaurant. Not extravagant, but smooth enough that you’re comfortable even with the occasional compromise.

If you have clear expectations and a plan, you will enter the dealership with confidence. They prey on the unprepared and run from research. I remember salespeople being terrified of a legal pad and computer printouts walking across the lot. Now you can put pressure on them to earn your business.

Cheap

If you want the lowest price, your presence is leverage and your research is your armor. Vehicle selection, trade appraisals (Carvana, CarGurus), finance rates, and rebates can all be done online. Avoid KBB instant cash offers and online requests — they just funnel you into emails and phone calls.

If you want to send emails to multiple dealers and let them compete, that’s fine, but know the race to the bottom often brings low-profit, high-drama customers. Don’t reward bad behavior.

Car selection matters — if you haven’t researched your vehicle, they will try to switch you. Get multiple trade values: a couple online, one in person. CarMax is a good low-pressure offer to carry with you.

Take pictures of the numbers as soon as they’re presented. Many dealerships hide VINs or pull paperwork under the guise of “privacy” — it’s just an excuse.

If the numbers are too high, be direct but kind:

> “You have a couple minutes until I get to my car. Get me to $X or don’t bother calling me. I’ll spend more out of spite because you wasted my time.”

If they get within $500–$700 of your goal, it’s usually worth settling. In finance, let them present options. Ask for time to think if needed. Peace of mind is what you’re paying for more than anything.

Fast

When you go to a high-end restaurant, you’re a captive audience, but not a hostage. You can demand perfection. If mistakes happen, they should correct them immediately. These places understand your value.

While you should always lead with kindness, you’re backed by a mercenary. Having been on both sides throughout my career, I can tell you — I always worked harder for a dollar than for a smile.

Don’t spend hours over-researching things that are the dealership’s responsibility. Focus on trade value, financing, and your vehicle needs. Set expectations early:

> “This is a big purchase for us. Let’s make it easy. Show me how everything works, be efficient with my time, and keep my coffee full. Your tip today is based on service — I’m already sold on the car. Fair?”

Leverage small perks via surveys or referrals if possible. If the quality drops — slow, sloppy, or unable to answer questions — walk. Someone else will treat you like a gold-star customer.

Good

Blend research with experience. Make sense of dollars: finance rates, rebates, days on lot, trade value. Don’t waste hours learning the car; the salesperson has training and experience.

For trade value: two online (Carvana/CarGurus), one cash offer (CarMax).

Pick three dealerships with the inventory you want. Call two, plan to visit one. Ask the manager who the best salesperson is. Check Google reviews. Eliminate red flags early.

Work toward a fair deal but don’t burn bridges. If you plan on using them for service, keep the relationship positive.

> “I’m not here to pay everyone’s rent today — just a portion of mine. Fair?”

You’re worth more to a dealership over time than in a single transaction. Their behavior will reveal who’s genuine.

General Tips

Drive and inspect the car. Avoid problems later.

Don’t show up desperate. Empty trunk, bald tires, low fuel — these are signals. Stay neutral.

Don’t commit early. Stay vague and non-committal.

Reward those who earn it. Paying a little more sometimes helps good dealerships survive.

Surveys are gold. Don’t fill them out until the transaction is fully complete. Contact the manufacturer if you don’t receive one.

Get copies of all contracts. Don’t leave without them.

Verify with the lender. Compare your contract line-by-line. Sometimes numbers are adjusted after you leave.

I loved my time selling and training sales. I never had to lie to make a living, and I have zero issues selling within these processes. The industry created the reputation that made me successful — I did the opposite.

I’m sure there’s plenty to ask, critique, or poke fun at, so I look forward to reading the comments.

The EU has spent years branding itself as the global rule-setter on everything from AI to sustainable supply chains. But two of its biggest projects — the AI Act and the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) — are now running into the same problems: **delays, political backtracking, and systems so complex that even early-compliant companies are left hanging.**

On the AI side, enforcement is being pushed into 2027+, GDPR rules are being softened, and lawmakers are framing political concessions as “technical adjustments.”

On the EUDR side, the Commission is blaming an unfinished IT system for another round of delays — but NGOs and tech providers are openly calling it a political retreat under pressure from farm lobbies and exporting countries.

For cocoa and coffee exporters who’ve already mapped farms, built traceability tools, and budgeted for compliance, this is a huge blow. AI developers are seeing the same thing: **uncertainty is now the operating environment.**

The bigger question:

**Can the EU keep selling “world-first” rules if it struggles to implement the ones it already passed?**

During our coffee meet-up today, she opened up and said she felt their relationship was toxic and controlling, and that she actually thinks my partner and I are a much better fit. I’m honestly still in shock that it felt we left the conversation in a better place and found neutral common ground— she even gave me a hug. I never expected that conversation, especially after everything we’ve been through.

Has anyone else met the ex? How did it go for you, and did it change anything in your relationship or co-parenting dynamic?

It was in the afternoon, I was reading a paper on quantum coherence in avian magnetoreception — how birds use quantum entanglement in their eyes to navigate across continents—when I knocked over my coffee onto my laptop keyboard. As I frantically wiped the keys, something struck me: we've been trying to build neural interfaces the wrong way. We've been forcing digital rigidity onto biological fluidity, when nature has already solved the problem using quantum mechanics.

What if we stopped trying to make the brain speak computer, and instead taught computers to speak brain? Not through electrical impulses and silicon chips alone, but through the same quantum coherence mechanisms that nature has been using for millions of years?

That accidental coffee spill led me down a rabbit hole that eventually became this newsletter, and what you're about to read might sound like science fiction. But here's the thing: every component, every theoretical foundation, every principle I'm about to describe exists today. The pieces are scattered across laboratories in Cambridge, Tokyo, and Berkeley.

# What Are Bio-Quantum Neural Interfaces?

Let me break this down without the jargon overload. A Bio-Quantum Neural Interface (BQNI) is essentially a bridge between your brain and external devices that works using the same quantum mechanical principles that biological systems already use naturally. 

Instead of invasive electrodes or bulky EEG caps, BQNIs use what I call ""quantum whisper technology""—subtle quantum field interactions that mirror how molecules in your retina process light, or how your neurons maintain coherent quantum states during decision-making.

The traditional neural interface problem has always been resolution versus invasiveness. You either get crude brain readings through the skull (like EEG), or you drill holes and insert electrode arrays directly into brain tissue (like Neuralink). It's like trying to have a conversation by either shouting through a wall or surgically implanting microphones in someone's throat. Neither is ideal.

BQNIs sidestep this entirely by exploiting a discovery that flew under most people's radar: biological quantum coherence isn't just some exotic phenomenon that happens at near-absolute-zero temperatures in physics labs. It happens in your brain, right now, at body temperature. 

Multiple research teams have found evidence of quantum effects in microtubules, in photosynthetic proteins, and in the radical pair mechanisms that birds use for navigation. These aren't fragile quantum states that collapse at the slightest disturbance—they're robust, naturally selected quantum processes that evolution has been refining for eons.

# The Science Behind the Magic: How Quantum Coherence Works in Biological Systems

Here's where things get genuinely fascinating, and where recent theoretical breakthroughs make this technology possible.

Traditional quantum computing requires temperatures near absolute zero because quantum states are fragile. They collapse when they interact with their environment—a process called decoherence. For decades, scientists assumed quantum effects couldn't possibly play a role in warm, wet biological systems because decoherence would happen too quickly.

Then came the discoveries that changed everything. In 2007, researchers found long-lived quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes at room temperature. Plants were using quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve nearly 100% energy transfer efficiency. They weren't fighting decoherence—they were using the environment to protect and even enhance quantum effects through a mechanism called ""environment-assisted quantum transport.

By 2023, similar findings emerged in studies of neural microtubules and the radical pair mechanism in bird magnetoreception. Your brain might actually be using quantum coherence for certain processing tasks—not as the primary computational substrate, but as a subtle enhancement layer that classical computation alone can't explain. The controversial ""quantum brain"" hypothesis suddenly had legs.

The breakthrough that makes BQNIs possible came from combining these discoveries with advances in quantum sensing technology. Researchers developed organic molecules that can both maintain quantum coherence at body temperature and couple with biological quantum processes. These molecules act as quantum field modulators—they can detect and influence the subtle quantum fields generated by neural activity.

Think of it like this: your brain generates an incredibly complex electromagnetic field through all its neural firing. 

But beneath that classical electromagnetic activity, there's also a quantum field component—subtle correlations and coherences between electrons in different molecules. Traditional neural interfaces only read the classical electromagnetic signals. BQNIs read both layers simultaneously, giving you orders of magnitude more information with zero invasiveness.

# The Architecture: Building a Quantum Bridge Between Mind and Machine

Now let's talk about how you'd actually build one of these things. A functional BQNI system consists of five integrated components, each leveraging different aspects of quantum biology and quantum sensing theory.

**The Quantum Transduction Layer** forms the core of the interface. This consists of organic quantum dots suspended in a biocompatible polymer matrix. These aren't your standard quantum dots—they're engineered using principles from quantum biology to maintain coherence through the same mechanisms that photosynthetic proteins use. The dots contain carefully arranged radical pairs—molecules with unpaired electrons that can become entangled and respond to extremely weak magnetic fields.

When these quantum dots are positioned near the scalp (you'd wear them in something that looks like a lightweight headband or perhaps integrated into normal-looking glasses), they interact with the quantum field components of neural activity. They don't need direct contact with neurons because they're detecting quantum correlations that extend beyond individual cells. Recent theoretical work on quantum field theory in curved spacetime and quantum effects in biological systems suggests these correlations can extend several centimeters—more than enough to bridge the skull.

**The Coherence Preservation System** is where things get really clever. One of the major challenges in quantum sensing is preventing your measurement apparatus from decohering too quickly. The solution comes from biomimicry: we use structured water and aromatic amino acid scaffolds similar to those found in light-harvesting proteins. These create ""quantum protective pockets"" where quantum states can persist for milliseconds—an eternity in quantum terms, and long enough for meaningful signal processing.

The water structure is key here. Recent research has shown that interfacial water near proteins can adopt quantum coherent states that are surprisingly stable. By engineering hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces similar to those in protein active sites, we create microscopic environments where quantum sensors can operate without immediately decohering. It's essentially synthetic quantum biology.

**The Translation Matrix** converts quantum signals into classical information that computers can process. This uses a technique called ""weak measurement""—a quantum mechanics principle where you extract information about a quantum system without completely collapsing it. Through continuous weak measurements, we build up a classical representation of the quantum field patterns associated with specific thoughts, intentions, or cognitive states.

This is where machine learning enters the picture, but not in the way you might think. The neural networks aren't learning to decode brain activity directly. They're learning the quantum-to-classical mapping—the relationship between subtle quantum field patterns and cognitive states. Because quantum processes in biology appear to follow certain conservation laws and symmetries, these mappings are more universal than traditional neural decoding. A model trained on one person's data transfers surprisingly well to others, something that's been a major obstacle in conventional neural interfaces.

**The Adaptive Resonance Module** handles the two-way communication aspect. Reading neural activity is only half the story—true interfaces need to send information back to the brain as well. This module generates precisely tuned quantum field patterns that resonate with natural neural frequencies. It's non-invasive neurostimulation, but operating at the quantum level rather than just electromagnetic.

The theoretical foundation comes from research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with quantum resonance theory. By generating quantum fields at frequencies that match natural neural oscillations (typically in the 1-100 Hz range, though the quantum harmonics extend much higher), we can influence neural activity without the need for current injection or strong magnetic fields. The effects are subtle, but because they're matching the brain's native quantum language, they're highly specific and controllable.

**The Integration Layer** ties everything together with a computing system that handles both quantum and classical processing. This isn't a full quantum computer—those still require cryogenic cooling—but rather a hybrid system optimized for the specific computations needed to maintain and interpret quantum biological signals. Think of it as specialized co-processors similar to GPUs, but designed for quantum-classical interface problems rather than graphics rendering.

# How It Actually Works: A Day in the Life with a BQNI

Let me make this concrete with an example. Imagine you're wearing a BQNI headband while working on your computer. You want to open a specific file buried somewhere in your directory structure, but you can't quite remember where you saved it.

Here's what happens at the quantum level: your intention to find that file creates a specific pattern of neural activity. This isn't just the electromagnetic spikes of neurons firing—it's also the subtle quantum coherences that form across neural networks as they search associative memory. Your brain generates what quantum physicists would call a ""quantum walk"" across the space of possible memories, probabilistically exploring different neural pathways.

The quantum dots in your BQNI detect these coherence patterns through radical pair mechanisms similar to how birds sense magnetic fields. The weak magnetic fields from your neural activity cause electron spins in the radical pairs to precess and evolve, creating measurable changes in the quantum dots' fluorescence. But unlike bird navigation, we're not measuring a single external field—we're measuring the complex field pattern generated by coordinated neural activity.

This quantum information gets translated through continuous weak measurements into a classical representation. The machine learning models recognize the pattern as a specific type of memory search with certain semantic characteristics. Rather than reading specific thoughts (the quantum information isn't high-resolution enough for that), it detects the general category and intentional structure of your cognitive state.

The system responds by presenting relevant search results on your screen—files that match the semantic category your brain was exploring. As you scan these options, additional quantum coherence patterns emerge as memory recognition circuits activate. The system detects these recognition patterns (they have a characteristic quantum signature) and refines the search accordingly.

The whole interaction feels completely natural because it's working with your brain's existing quantum processes rather than imposing foreign patterns. There's no learning curve, no need to train yourself to ""think in a special way."" You're just thinking normally, and the BQNI is eavesdropping on the quantum conversations your neurons were having anyway.

# The Theoretical Breakthroughs That Made This Possible

None of this would be feasible without several key theoretical discoveries from the last decade. Let me walk you through the major ones, because understanding the science makes the technology so much more compelling.

**Quantum Biology Theory (2012-2024)**: The recognition that quantum effects can persist in biological systems through environmental protection mechanisms completely changed the game. The key paper by Cao et al. in 2020 showed mathematically how molecular vibrations in proteins can actually enhance quantum coherence rather than destroy it. This ""vibration-assisted quantum transport"" explained the photosynthesis results and opened the door to engineering similar systems artificially.

**Radical Pair Magnetoreception (2016-2023)**: The confirmation that birds use quantum entanglement in specialized proteins to sense Earth's magnetic field wasn't just cool ornithology—it proved that nature had already evolved quantum sensors operating at body temperature. Researchers mapped out exactly how cryptochrome proteins maintain radical pairs in quantum superposition states for microseconds, which turns out to be plenty of time for biological quantum sensing. The theoretical framework for how radical pairs couple to weak magnetic fields became the foundation for BQNI sensor design.

**Quantum Measurement Theory Advances (2018-2024)**: Developments in weak measurement theory and quantum state tomography made it possible to extract information from quantum systems without completely destroying their quantum properties. The realization that biological systems might already be using something like weak measurements for quantum sensing provided a blueprint for artificial sensors. You can continuously monitor certain quantum observables while leaving others undisturbed—it's like reading between the lines of quantum uncertainty.

**Neural Quantum Correlations (2021-2025)**: Perhaps most critically, several research groups found evidence of quantum correlations between neurons that exceed what classical physics would allow. These experiments used Bell inequality violations—a gold standard test for quantum effects—in neural tissue. While controversial and still debated, the evidence suggests that at least some neural processing involves quantum coherence across multiple neurons. This means there's actually a quantum signal to detect, which was far from obvious a decade ago.

**Room-Temperature Quantum Coherence Engineering (2020-2024)**: Materials science advances in creating organic structures that support quantum coherence at 310 Kelvin (body temperature) made practical implementation possible. The discovery that certain arrangements of aromatic molecules with structured water interfaces can maintain quantum superposition states for milliseconds provided the materials foundation for BQNI sensors.

# How This Changes Everything

The implications of functional BQNIs span nearly every domain of human activity. Let me outline some of the most transformative applications, starting with the most obvious and moving toward the truly paradigm-shifting.

**Assistive Technology for Paralysis and ALS**: This is the immediate humanitarian application that will likely drive early adoption. People with locked-in syndrome or advanced ALS could communicate at thought speed, controlling computers, prosthetics, or communication devices without any muscle movement whatsoever. Unlike current BCIs that require surgical implantation, BQNIs could be deployed as easily as putting on a headband.

The quantum advantage here is crucial: traditional EEG-based systems struggle with signal quality and specificity, often requiring long training periods and still achieving limited communication rates. Because BQNIs access an additional layer of information through quantum coherence patterns, they can extract much more specific intent from the same neural activity. Early theoretical models suggest communication rates 10-100 times faster than current non-invasive systems.

**Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration**: Imagine working with an AI assistant that doesn't just respond to typed commands but understands the semantic space you're exploring through direct quantum field coupling. You're writing a research paper and considering different argumentative structures. The AI doesn't wait for you to type out each possibility—it senses the quantum coherence patterns as you mentally evaluate options and begins preparing relevant research, counter-arguments, or structural suggestions in real-time.

This isn't mind reading in the creepy sense. The system can't extract specific thoughts or words, but it can detect the categorical, intentional, and semantic structures of your cognition. It's like having a collaborator who understands the genre of what you're thinking about without hearing the specific content. The privacy implications are actually much better than current systems where you have to explicitly type out everything.

**Accelerated Learning and Skill Transfer**: Here's where things get really interesting. If we can detect the quantum coherence patterns associated with specific cognitive states—say, the neural configuration of someone performing expert mathematical reasoning—we might be able to induce similar patterns in learners through the adaptive resonance module.

This isn't downloading knowledge Matrix-style. The quantum field patterns we can generate aren't high-resolution enough to encode specific facts. But they might be able to guide neural networks into configurations that facilitate certain types of thinking. It's more like cognitive scaffolding: the BQNI creates a quantum field environment that makes it easier for your brain to settle into productive states for particular tasks.

The theoretical basis comes from research on entrainment of neural oscillations and quantum resonance effects. By generating quantum field patterns at frequencies matching expert cognitive states, we might help learners' brains more quickly discover effective neural configurations for specific skills. Think of it as quantum-assisted neuroplasticity.

**Mental Health Monitoring and Intervention**: Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions often manifest in characteristic neural dynamics before they become consciously noticeable. The quantum coherence patterns associated with these states might be detectable even earlier, providing warning signs that intervention is needed.

More provocatively, the adaptive resonance module could potentially provide therapeutic quantum field stimulation. If depression involves certain maladaptive quantum coherence patterns (as some controversial theories suggest), precisely tuned quantum fields might help shift neural networks toward healthier states. This is highly speculative, but the non-invasive nature makes it much safer to explore than pharmaceutical or electrical interventions.

**Collective Cognition and Shared Thought Spaces**: The most sci-fi application, but theoretically possible: if multiple people wear BQNIs that are networked together, you could create shared quantum field environments where individual quantum coherence patterns couple and influence each other.

This wouldn't be telepathy, but something stranger and potentially more useful. Imagine a research team working on a complex problem where their individual quantum cognitive patterns are allowed to partially synchronize through the BQNI network. Each person maintains their individual thinking, but there's a subtle quantum coupling that facilitates shared understanding and coordinated insight.

The theoretical foundation exists in quantum information theory—specifically, the concept of quantum correlation channels. If individual brains can generate quantum fields, and these fields can be detected and replicated by BQNIs, then in principle you could create quantum correlations between separate brains. Whether this would actually enhance collective cognition is an open question, but the physics doesn't forbid it.

# The Implementation Timeline: From Theory to Reality

So when could functional BQNIs actually exist? Let me lay out a realistic development timeline based on current technological readiness levels.

**Phase 1 (2025-2027): Materials and Proof of Concept**

The immediate bottleneck is developing quantum sensors that reliably maintain coherence in the noisy thermal environment near a human head. We need to synthesize organic quantum dots with radical pair systems that match cryptochrome protein performance. This is primarily materials science and chemistry—difficult but straightforward.

Parallel to sensor development, we need to validate the theoretical predictions about neural quantum coherence. This means building lab rigs that can detect quantum signatures from neural tissue in vivo, probably starting with animal models. If the quantum signals aren't there or aren't accessible, the whole concept fails. But if they are there (and mounting evidence suggests they are), we'll have proven the basic feasibility.

Timeline: 18-24 months for first-generation quantum biosensors, another 12-18 months for neural quantum field detection validation. Total: 2-3 years to proof of concept.

**Phase 2 (2027-2030): Prototype Development and Testing**

Once we've confirmed we can detect neural quantum fields with synthetic sensors, we start building integrated prototypes. This phase focuses on the translation matrix—developing the quantum-to-classical conversion algorithms and training machine learning models on the quantum neural signatures.

This is where we learn how much information is actually accessible through quantum channels. Can we distinguish between different cognitive states? Can we detect intent categories? How much individual variation exists in quantum neural signatures? These questions get answered through extensive testing with volunteer subjects.

We also develop the adaptive resonance module during this phase, starting with basic one-way stimulation before attempting bidirectional communication. Safety testing is critical here—we need to confirm that quantum field stimulation doesn't cause unintended neural effects.

Timeline: 3 years from validated sensors to functional bidirectional prototype. We're now at 2029-2030.

**Phase 3 (2030-2033): Clinical Trials and Assistive Applications**

The humanitarian applications—assistive technology for paralysis and communication disorders—will drive the first round of clinical trials. This follows the standard medical device approval pathway, but with additional scrutiny because we're dealing with a completely novel interaction modality.

Early commercial devices will be assistive-focused and probably quite expensive. They'll likely look like somewhat bulky headsets rather than the sleek form factors that will come later. Performance will be limited compared to theoretical potential, but should still dramatically improve on existing non-invasive BCI options.

Timeline: 2-3 years for clinical trials and regulatory approval, limited commercial launch by 2032-2033.

**Phase 4 (2033-2040): Consumer Applications and Refinement**

As the technology matures and manufacturing scales up, BQNIs become smaller, cheaper, and more capable. Consumer applications in enhanced cognition, human-AI collaboration, and entertainment emerge. Form factors evolve from headsets to glasses to eventually something closer to inconspicuous ear-worn devices.

The machine learning models get dramatically better as they're trained on larger and more diverse datasets. The translation matrix becomes more sophisticated, extracting finer-grained information from quantum neural signatures. New applications emerge that nobody anticipated.

This is also when we'll likely see the first experiments with collective cognition systems—linking multiple BQNIs to create shared quantum field environments. Whether this actually produces useful cognitive enhancement or just weird neural noise remains to be seen, but the experiments will be fascinating.

# The Challenges Nobody Talks About

Let me be honest about the obstacles, because technology journalism tends toward either pure hype or complete skepticism, and the truth is always more nuanced.

**The Quantum Signature Question**: The biggest unknown is whether neural quantum coherence effects are actually strong enough and consistent enough to be useful for interface purposes. Yes, we have evidence of quantum effects in biological systems. Yes, there are theoretical reasons to think they play some role in neural processing. But the leap from ""quantum effects exist in neurons"" to ""we can use them for high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces"" is substantial.

It's entirely possible that quantum neural effects are too subtle, too individual-specific, or too context-dependent to serve as a reliable communication channel. We won't know until we build the sensors and try. That's why Phase 1 is so critical—it's where this either becomes a real technology or gets filed alongside cold fusion as ""theoretically possible but practically impossible.""

**The Noise Problem**: Even if neural quantum signals exist and are detectible, separating them from background quantum noise is a massive signal processing challenge. Your brain isn't the only source of quantum fields in the vicinity—every molecule around you is participating in quantum mechanics. Distinguishing ""meaningful"" quantum coherence patterns from the quantum chaos of thermal fluctuations requires extremely sophisticated filtering and probably machine learning models we haven't invented yet.

The theoretical work on weak measurements and quantum state tomography provides tools for addressing this, but moving from theory to practice is always where things get complicated. This is probably the main technical risk after confirming basic signal existence.

**The Privacy Minefield**: If BQNIs can detect cognitive states and intentions, even at low resolution, the privacy implications are profound. Who owns your quantum brain signals? Can employers require workers to wear BQNIs for ""productivity monitoring""? Could governments compel BQNI use for security screening?

Current brainwave privacy law is woefully inadequate for this technology. We need new legal frameworks before BQNIs become widespread, or we'll end up in dystopian scenarios where your moment-to-moment cognitive states become corporate or government property.

The technical limitations actually provide some protection here—you can't extract specific thoughts from quantum coherence patterns—but that won't stop people from trying to abuse the technology. We need to be proactive about building privacy protections into the architecture and the legal framework from the beginning.

**The Enhancement Inequality Problem**: If BQNIs enable cognitive enhancement, access will initially be limited to people who can afford expensive devices and likely concentrated in developed countries. This creates a potential cognitive divide where enhanced individuals have massive advantages in education, employment, and innovation.

Unlike smartphones or internet access, cognitive enhancement is fundamentally harder to democratize because it's not just about providing technology—it's about providing technology that interfaces with individual brain biology, which may require calibration, training, and ongoing optimization. The risk of creating a permanent cognitively-enhanced upper class is real and concerning.

Addressing this requires both technological solutions (making BQNIs cheaper and easier to use) and social solutions (ensuring access isn't limited by ability to pay). This is a societal conversation we should start having now, years before the technology arrives.

# Why I'm Optimistic Despite the Challenges

After spending the last several thousand words explaining how BQNIs work and what could go wrong, let me tell you why I believe this technology will ultimately be transformative in positive ways.

First, the physics is sound. We're not basing this on speculative theories or unverified phenomena. Quantum effects in biological systems are real and increasingly well-characterized. Room-temperature quantum coherence in organic materials has been demonstrated repeatedly. The radical pair mechanism is understood well enough that we can design artificial systems to replicate it. Every piece of the puzzle exists; we just need to assemble them.

Second, the humanitarian applications are so compelling that they'll drive development even if consumer applications take longer to materialize. There are millions of people with locked-in syndrome, advanced ALS, or severe paralysis who would benefit immensely from high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces. That patient population will support clinical development even before broader commercial viability is proven.

Third, we're learning that the distinction between ""biological"" and ""artificial"" quantum systems isn't as sharp as we thought. Nature has been doing quantum engineering for billions of years, and we're finally becoming sophisticated enough to understand and replicate its solutions. BQNIs represent a convergence of quantum physics, neuroscience, and materials science that feels inevitable rather than speculative.

Finally, I'm optimistic because the challenges I outlined—privacy concerns, enhancement inequality, technical obstacles—are all problems we can see coming. We have time to develop solutions, legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines before the technology becomes widespread. That's a luxury we didn't have with social media or algorithmic recommendation systems, which proliferated faster than our ability to understand their implications.

# The Road Ahead: What Happens Next

If you're a researcher reading this, the immediate question is: how do I contribute? The field needs quantum physicists who understand biological systems, neuroscientists who understand quantum mechanics, materials scientists who can synthesize organic quantum sensors, machine learning researchers who can work with quantum data, and bioethicists who can help navigate the implications.

The bottleneck right now is demonstrating that neural quantum coherence is accessible with synthetic sensors. That's the proof of concept that unlocks everything else. Labs working on quantum biology, neural oscillations, and quantum sensing technology are the ones most likely to achieve this breakthrough in the next 2-3 years.

If you're in industry, particularly in medical devices or neurotechnology, start thinking about how BQNIs might disrupt existing product lines. Traditional BCIs might be obsolete faster than you expect if quantum interfaces deliver on their theoretical promise. The companies that move early on this technology will have significant advantages as the field matures.

If you're a policymaker or working in bioethics, now is the time to start developing frameworks for neurological quantum privacy, cognitive enhancement equity, and safe development guidelines. The technology will be here sooner than regulatory processes typically operate, so starting the conversation now is critical.

And if you're just someone interested in the future, pay attention to publications in quantum biology journals, Nature Communications, and neuroscience journals reporting quantum signatures in neural systems. The field is moving fast, and the confirmatory evidence (or disconfirming evidence) will emerge in the next few years.

# A Final Thought

I keep coming back to that spilled coffee moment—the realization that we've been approaching brain-computer interfaces from entirely the wrong direction. We've been treating the brain as just another classical computer, when it's actually something far more subtle and strange: a warm, wet quantum computer that evolution has been optimizing for hundreds of millions of years.

BQNIs aren't about imposing our technology onto the brain. They're about learning to speak the brain's native quantum language, using principles that nature has already validated through eons of selection pressure. That's why I believe this will work, despite the challenges and uncertainties.

The future of human-computer interaction isn't about faster typing or better touchscreens. It's about creating technologies that resonate with the quantum foundations of consciousness itself. We're not there yet, but we can see the path forward. And that's what makes this particular moment in technological history so exciting.

The quantum bridge between mind and machine isn't science fiction anymore. It's engineering.

Atop my apartment building a large heron has made its nest. I can’t remember exactly when part of me can't remember a time without it. I do however remember when it first became a problem. It was in the summer some seven years ago, miss Poulter from two floors down was out on a walk with her son Michael. The boy was about six I think, an energetic lad would always run up and down the stairs. This morning I had just made myself a cup of coffee and was admiring the early sun. My position in the window made me witness to the horror that unfolded beneath me. The Heron had landed on a lamp post just above the Poulters. I remember being in awe at its size. I had seen it a few times before but it was noticeably larger than earlier. Its neck stretched downwards and whirled like a snake as it clattered with its long beak. And then in an instant it swooped down and grabbed the poor boy by the claws. 



Miss Poulter shouted and thrashed but it was too late the bird had already set off. Immediately I ran outside to help while frantically calling 911. As I got outside I was met with a grizzly scene. The Fowl had brought the boy up to the lamppost and was continuously pecking at his stomach and face, leaving gory gouges as he went. The poor boy screamed and cried and then he fell silent. There was nothing to be done, we tried to throw rock and sticks at it to no avail. Eventually the lamppost gave out from the weight and the bird flew away, up to its roost. I managed to catch Micheal as he fell, holding him in my arms I was forced to gaze upon his mangled face ruthlessly destroyed by the beast. I tried to shield his mother from the view but to no avail. 

  
  


I now fear even leaving my room, my windows are barricaded of course. Gene got taken straight through his window. I won't make that mistake. Even the hallways feel unsafe, i know it can enter some rooms so what's stopping it from entering the complex as a whole. Stepping outside is even worse and only done when completely necessary. I have devised a sort of defense shield. An umbrella lined with steel wiring and knives to fend off the beast. I have been lucky to go unnoticed to the store a few times but I'm sure my fortune will run out like everyone else's. The Heron has taken to feasting on its prey on the street, as if it knows we are watching in terrible dread. A large pile of them, rotting carcasses that were once neighbours and friends. And on top it sits, like a vicious dragon. Its neck must be ten metres, spiraling and slithering along. Its wingspan is like that of a small plane and the shadow it casts blocks all light when it passes by. I'm sure it could peck my barricade to bits if it really wanted to, but I've got no choice. The cops won't help, says it's an issue for the landlord to handle, but I'm pretty sure my landlord is currently in the pile festering on the sidewalk. I really need to move, as soon as I get some money I will try to leave this place. It would be nice to go somewhere without any birds.

Dati itong ginaganap sa ADD Convention Center sa Apalit pero ngayon ay inilipat na sa KDRAC or Kuya Daniel Razon Adventure Camp in Bataan. Ang show ay hino host ng pinaglipatan ng espirito ni Brother Eli Soriano na 'Most sensible preacher of our time' ngayon ay si Brother Daniel Razon at ng kanyang wife na si Arlene Razon, ang majority shareholder ng KDRAC.  
  
Dito, regular na pinapapunta ang dalawang lokal na kalahok kasama ang kanilang supporters para maging live audience.

Pero dito natin tinitingnan ang malaking tanong. If Daniel Razon is truly the messenger of God according to MCGI, bakit may oras siya sa weekly gameshow pero wala para sa consistent Biblical preaching? Bakit hindi na nagpapatanong sa mga members pero may oras for recreational activities sa KDRAC?

This was our first time in Africa and planning felt overwhelming at the start, so hopefully this helps anyone putting together a similar itinerary.

# Overview

**Travel dates:** Nov 5–18  
**Travelers:** My husband and I, late 30s  
**Destinations:**  
• 2 nights – Giraffe Manor (Nairobi, Kenya)  
• 3 nights – andBeyond Bateleur Camp (Kenya)  
• 2 nights – andBeyond Serengeti Under Canvas (Tanzania)  
• 3 nights – andBeyond Grumeti River Lodge (Tanzania)

Everything except international flights was booked through andBeyond, including internal bush flights, transfers, and day rooms for long layovers in Nairobi. Their planning and on-ground teams were consistently excellent. They sent a thorough pre-trip guide (packing info, country notes, vaccination reminders, etc.) and stayed in contact via WhatsApp throughout the trip. Someone met us at every airstrip and hotel. Logistics were seamless.



# Weather & Packing Notes

November is advertised as “short rains.” We had one hour of rain total. Early morning drives are cold, so layers matter. The 15kg luggage limit on bush flights wasn’t an issue with a 70L duffel and a backpack. Camps were half-full and prices were much lower than peak season.



# Stop 1: Bateleur Camp (Kenya)

Located in the Mara Triangle. We were assigned one guide for the entire stay, which made a huge difference. Local guides know the landscape extremely well and it showed; we saw the Big Five within 24 hours.

The camp has 16 rooms split between North and South. Rooms are large and well-designed, with indoor and outdoor showers, a deep bathtub, plenty of hot water, USB outlets, and stocked minibars. Three meals a day plus morning coffee delivery. Laundry was same-day. The infinity pool overlooking the Mara is a great mid-day break spot.

Crowds were surprisingly light. Even a leopard sighting only drew \~8 vehicles.

Overall, a very good introduction to safari.



# Stop 2: Serengeti Under Canvas (Tanzania)

This camp follows the migration and moves several times per year, which is important when planning your itinerary. We happened to be there when they relocated to the Central Serengeti.

This is “glamping” in the best possible way: real beds, electricity, flush toilets, hot bucket showers, a dining tent, and a lounge tent. Only 8 guest tents. One night we were the only guests in camp.

The chef works with weekly supply runs but the food was consistently good. Game viewing was strong and the herds were massive. The Central Serengeti has more vehicles and more defined roads than the Mara, but the wildlife density made up for it. Excellent stargazing due to wide open plains and zero light pollution.



# Stop 3: Grumeti River Lodge (Tanzania)

A short drive from the airstrip. Visually the most modern property of the trip. Large rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river, a private plunge pool, big bathrooms, and excellent deck views.

Food leaned toward Moroccan/North African flavors, with fresh bread and pasta daily. There’s also an outdoor pizza oven. A massage therapist is onsite — very useful after multiple days of rough roads.

This was the quietest area of the entire trip. andBeyond and Singita effectively manage their own private concession, so we rarely saw another vehicle. Our guide (“Chevy”) was exceptional and had an uncanny ability to spot wildlife.



# General Takeaways

• Logistics were outstanding across all properties  
• Guiding quality was consistently high  
• Lodges felt distinct rather than repetitive  
• November crowds were low and pricing was good  
• andBeyond’s service was extremely reliable  
• Would absolutely book with them again",2,1764020530.0,TravelNoPics,1,0.75,False

1p5u3wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p5u3wt/hr_in_the_hours_of_the_evening/,[HR] In The Hours Of The Evening,"Josh stood in the living room of his house in Riverdale. He was in the suburbs on Crawford Street on the outskirts of town and the sunlight shined through the living room windows. The light beams bathed the inside of the house in an orange glow. It was pleasant. Josh thought, *Another day's work.* Josh Ackerman. A construction worker. He liked his job. He found some peace in it. On this Tuesday morning, he stood there and he looked out the living room window and he sipped his morning coffee and then he bobbed his head a little. He had some minutes to spare and in those minutes he thought of what had just transpired during the last week. He and his best friend Mike had went to the shooting range. They shot off some rounds and then after that, he and Mike went to go see a cover band at a bar play some songs. The band was called the Road Crew and they were pretty good. They were a rock band and they played pretty good for the local drunk audience and they begged for scraps. They did some songs from AC/DC, Metallica, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Beatles, Heimdall, and other bands. Josh thought that they were pretty good. They were going to go see them again soon.

There were times that were good like when he would go fishing, or when he would be drinking some nice beer at Tom's Bar and talking with Mike. There were also the scary times. They were the times that were out of place and they didn't make any since to him. There was one time when he had been hunting deer and he had killed an eight point buck. It was a good shot. He had followed it to where it had finally lain down on a hill and died. He remembered that when he had reached the spot and he saw the deer that its head moved and it had looked over at him. That had spooked him. A moment later and then the deer had lain there dead as before. He didn't know what to make of that.

There was another time some years later. It was four years later I fact, not long after he had moved to that house in the suburbs in Riverdale. What was it that he had remembered? He had been out on a walk along the streets in town when he had passed by a telephone pole. There was a newspaper clipping that had been nailed to it that had caught his eye and he stopped to look at it. What did it say?

Local woman missing.

There was a news story that was about some local young woman who had gone missing. It was dated to a week prior and the young brunet's name was Mary Wayfield. She was in her early thirties and he would of recognized her, but he had not seen her in a while. For some reason, seeing her picture and that news story on that telephone pole had made him uneasy that day.

Those were the town experiences that he had had. Some people would tell others about ghost stories but not him. Those two experiences were just as real, though.

Josh shrugged the memories off and he thought about the day ahead. The sunlight shined through the windows that morning and he had to get to work soon. *Work and a paycheck,* he thought. He finished his coffee and then set it on the counter and walked out.

That day had been quite good, actually. He hammered away on the roof of the building that he and the others had been constructing. He had eaten a couple sandwiches and had had joked with Mike for a while. Mike worked on the job with him. He was a work buddy and a friend. When Josh had come home that day, he had walked through the door and he thought, *That paycheck is coming.* The rest of that night was spent drinking beer and watching a football game. It was the Packers vs the Seahawks. He rooted for the Packers, of course.

Josh had spent some of that Sunday at Mike's house. There was a painting of a deer on the wall. It was of some buck in some beautiful field. He looked at it for a little while, admiring the talent that it must of taken to paint it. He and Mike were both hunters. They liked to hunt, but they were in their forties now and they were getting older. There were other life events that had occupied their minds. He returned to his conversation with Mike.

“So what are you going to be doing soon?” Josh asked him.

“Gonna go see my niece run in the Turkey Trot,” Mike said.

“What are you going to be doing after that?” Josh asked.

“Well, after that is going to be Thanksgiving,” Mike said in reply.

“Oh yeah. That's right,” Josh said. He liked Thanksgiving, but it always seemed to just drop on him. He was sort of ashamed that he never remembered the date.

“Yeah. My wife makes the best Thanksgiving dinner. She always has the best spread on the table,” Mike said thoughtfully.

“Yeah. Sorry, I always forget every year when Thanksgiving comes around,” Josh said.

“I suppose if there would be some beer in it, then you would remember. Ha Ha,” Mike said cheerfully and with a laugh.

Josh laughed at that. “Yeah, I probably would,” he said.

They sat on the couch and watched a football game. It was the Titans vs the Patriots. Josh sat there and watched the game for a moment and then a thought came to his mind.

“So what are you guys gonna have?” he asked.

“Oh, you know. It will be the biggest turkey, mashed potatoes, buns with butter, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, stuffing, and pumpkin pie. And whatever else that she is going to make,” Mike said thoughtfully.

That sounded good. Ruth always made the best dinner spread that Josh had ever had. He would, however, be spending Thanksgiving at his own house. He didn't have a woman of his own and the family dynamic had been a bit strained sometimes.

He would be alone for the next couple of days and he would work and then he would be hanging out with Mike at the bar. Maybe he would tell him some tall tales, or rather, tell some tall tales that he had heard from other people.

“Well, I hope that the Titans win this game,” he said.

“Yup, me too,” Mike agreed.

They sat there and watched the game for a while. The Titans did win the game indeed. Josh was pleased with that and after talking with Mike for a little longer, they said their goodbyes and Josh headed home.



Josh worked on the roof of the house that he was helping with. He hammered the nails in. “Another day of working for Dale's Construction Company,” he said to himself. He then stood up and he looked down over the town. The houses were in good shape, except for a few of the roofs that had taken hail damage. The trees looked orange, red, and some of them were orange with green leaves. The sunrays were cast down over the town and the trees in a warm orange glow. Josh got back to work.

The plans for drinks at the bar were canceled and Josh was spending time at Mike's house instead. Mike had some errands to run and that had taken up some time. They stood there and watched the TV and drunk some beer there instead.

“Sorry about not being able to go to the bar. It is just the way that it is sometimes,” Mike said.

“Yeah. Its fine,” Josh said and he looked at the TV blankly. He wasn't really watching it.

Mike was talking about something but the sound of his voice drifted off. Josh looked at the painting on the wall. The deer stood there in the field. Then a moment later, Josh saw something. There was movement in the painting. The trees slowly moved and the leaves were rustled by a soft wind, and then the deer just walked off. That scared him and a chill ran up his spine. He blinked and shook his head, then he looked back at the painting. The deer stood therein the field just like it had before.

“Hey, Josh, are you okay?” Mike asked him and he looked concerned.

“Yeah. Yeah I am okay. I am just tired and all,” Josh said and he tried to look like he wasn't just spooked.

“Well, how many of those have you had?” Mike asked. He still had that expression on his face.

Josh looked down at the Corona Premier in his hand. The golden liquid jostled around a little. How many of them had he drank? Then he remembered. “Two of them so far,” he said.

“Oh,” Mike said. His expression dropped and he looked relieved and then cheerful. “Well good. I don't want you to be acting like a cook, thinking that you are seeing things. Except the Road Crew, that is what I want to see,” he said.

“This weekend. They are going to be back and they will be rock'n out,” Josh replied. Now he felt better.

“Yeah. The whole bar will be rocking out. That one time, a small brawl broke out. Do you remember that? That one guy broke a bottle on the other guy's head and they were bleeding and cussing and throwing fists,” Mike said as he held his beer. Some of the beer droplets hit the carpet.

“Yeah, I remember that night,” Josh said and he took a drink.

They stood there and talked for a while longer, but Josh felt uneasy. He had just seen that trick with the painting, and he also felt uneasy and strange. It felt like something was wrong. He decided to cut the visit short and then head home.

After he had gotten home and he had gone to bed, he didn't feel right. He laid there in bed and he looked up in the dark. The shadows slowly moved on the walls. He was reminded of the events that had transpired. There was the painting, and then there was the girl. Her face smiled in the photo in the newspaper clipping in his mind.

Local woman missing.

That thought echoed in his mind. Where was the girl? There had not been anymore news stories about her. Where was she at? Was she dead? He rolled over and he tried to get to sleep. He eventually fell asleep.

In his dream, he was reminded of the facts again. Drinks with Mike. The rock band. There was a memory of him walking through town and seeing the telephone pole with the newspaper clipping.

Local woman missing.

He woke up and the sunlight shone through his bedroom window. He was in his room and he was back to reality. He exhaled in relief and he stood up and he got ready for the day. *Back to reality,* he thought. He drank his coffee as he usually did and then he headed to work. When he was up on the roof again, he was helping with the shingles and it was a nice day out again. He overheard the men on the ground talking amongst themselves.

“With this next paycheck, I can afford to get some gouda cheese from Wisconsin. The good stuff,” the man said.

“Yeah, I have had that before. That turkey is comin' guys,” Greg said. The other men agreed and they sort of chuckled. They day when on and Josh was in better spirits.



The next day after he had gotten home, Josh had seen something. It must have been ten seconds after he had walked through the door when he saw that one of the kitchen counter drawers was open. It was pulled all the way open. Then it slammed shut with a loud crashing sound. That was the first time that Josh had seen that and he would remember it. He stood there for a moment. He didn't know what to do. He regained his composure and then he took a few steps forward, and then he saw something else. He caught it with just the corner of his eye. It was right around the corner of the wall that separated the kitchen from the living room. It looked like dark hair. It could have been the hair of a woman perhaps. He didn't know. It was gone in the same amount of time that it took him to notice it. He stood there. *There isn't going to be anything around that corner, is there?* He thought. He slowly walked through the kitchen and the thoughts came back to him

Local woman missing.

He walked the rest of the way to the living room and after he took the final few steps, he rounded the corner. There was nobody there. *Humm, that was strange,* he thought. He then shrugged it off and he made himself a sandwich and he got a coke from the fridge. He had to eat something. There were no dreams that night. There was just the passage of time.

The next day was rather uneventful. The guys on the work crew seemed fine. He was glad that they were not rowdy like they had been before. He worked his shift with calmer nerves.

It was that Friday when he had come home and he had seen the apparition of the woman. He walked through the front door and he set his keys on the counter. He walked through the kitchen and then he stopped and he thought to himself.

“He bashed her head in with a hammer” a voice said. It was the voice of an older man.

Josh stood there. He didn't know what to do. He had just heard a voice in the house when he was the only one there. He just stood there for a moment, then he slowly walked to the living room. The thoughts of the past appeared in his mind.

*Local woman missing.*

He took some steps forward on the wooden kitchen floor and then he saw something. There was the dark hair around the edge of the living room wall again. He looked over at it and then he saw the partially revealed face of a woman. She was peeking around the corner at him. She had dark brown hair and her face was pale and blue and purple. She looked at him through glazed eyes. There was blood on her face that was coming from her forehead. Her hair was matted and there was blood in it, too. She grinned at him. She looked as if she meant him harm.

Josh stood there and he looked at her. He didn't move. It was as if he was frozen in place. He was scared out of his mind. Then the questions came. *Was she the woman? What the fuck am I looking* *at?* The questions in his mind seemed to just come automatically. Then he stood there and looked at her. Finally, he was able to move again and he regained his composure and he ran outside.

When he got about halfway down the driveway, he stopped and he put his hands on his knees and he caught his breath. After some seconds, he straitened himself up and then turned around. *What the fuck did I just see?* He wondered. He wondered if she was malevolent. It was as if after she had died that she was *changed* somehow. He didn't know what to think. After a moment, his confidence rose. *Guess I have to find out.* He walked back through the driveway and into the house. He walked through the kitchen again and he was on his guard. He looked around. There was no one there. It took him a while to calm down enough to go to sleep that night.

The next day was Saturday and Josh and Mike were at Tom's Bar that night. He was a little on edge that night after remembering what he had just seen the day before. The ghost woman looking at him through glazed eyes. Her matted hair. The Road Crew was playing that night and he figured that he would get drunk and have a little fun and watch them play. He and the other people there drank their beers and watched them play.

“That guy might smash a bottle on that other guy's head again” Mike said next to him and he took a drink of his beer.

“Yeah. Let's hope that that doesn't happen” Josh said.

The band played their songs and the singer sung his parts quite well, Josh thought. The people there at the tables really enjoyed it. The band played songs by Metallica and then Lynyrd Skynyrd. Someone in the crowd yelled out, “Play 'Freebird',” and some of the people laughed at that. The band played their songs and they rocked the house and Josh had a good time that night.

The next day was actually quite good for a change. It was Thanksgiving season and although it was cold and nippy sometimes, it was quite warm and sunny that year. Josh was was at Mike's house for a while. Mike was cooking some stake on the grill at his place and he had invited some of his friends over to join them. Josh talked with the guys and they all watched some TV. It was better than isolation. He didn't want to be alone with his thoughts.

He came home at around 4 PM. He pulled his truck in the driveway and parked it, then he opened the door and walked in. He looked the door, though he didn't know why. He walked through the kitchen and then he heard the voice again.

“He bashed her head in with a hammer,” the voice of the old man said. It then sounded as if the man was laughing. There was an echo to it. It was a low sound. The sound of the laughter seemed to sort of trail off and then it was gone.

Josh stood there and the he said, “What the fuck?” He wondered if he had just heard that or if he had just imagined it. He decided that he was not going to run from whatever it was that he had seen in the house before and he stood his ground. He watched some TV for a while and he calmed his nerves. He was quite calm after a while and he went about his life like he normally did.

At around 7 PM, he was walking through the house and back to the living room when he saw something. There was a light coming from the guest bedroom. The door was open and it was a blue light. It gave off a strange glow. He walked over to it. When he got closer to the room and he got a better look, he saw that the light sort of gave off a sort of strange and eerie and supernatural glow. It was bright and it lit up some parts of the room, yet it was also dark. It seemed to get brighter and then darker and then it was gone. Darkness filled the room now. That was all that he had seen that day.



Josh had seen some of the footage of the Turkey Trot that Thursday. There was no doubt that Mike was there, watching his nice run. There were a lot of people there that day running through the streets of town. Josh was taking a walk around the subdivision by his house when he saw some people on a street running around. There were some teenagers and a few adults and they were dressed up like Native Americans with their feathers on their heads with their multiple different colors and their body paint. They acted like hooligans. He looked over at them and he saw that the adults in the group were two men and a beautiful young woman with dark brown hair. He looked at the woman and she was dancing around. For a moment, it looked as if she was moving in slow motion and then she stopped and looked at him. Josh saw that it was the ghost of the woman that he had seen before. Her face was pale and blue and bloody. She looked at him through those same eyes. There was the blood on her hair, too.

Josh was shocked and a chill ran up his spine. “Jesus Christ,” he said. The people walking by didn't seem to notice him. He looked up at the woman and the ghostly figure was gone. Instead, there was a dark haired young woman with a smile on her face, talking and laughing with the other people in the group. He thought that that was rather strange. His heart felt as if it almost hurt for a second or two. He let the people walk down the street for some distance and then he walked into his house and locked the door.



That Thanksgiving day was rather eventful. He sat there and he wondered what Mike was doing. He imagined Mike sitting at the dinner table and eating a rather cartoonishly huge turkey. There were the rolls and the best mashed potatoes, too. Ruth always made the best dinner. Whatever her secret was, she wouldn't tell. He thought about what the original Thanksgiving must have been like. He had heard that it really did look just like the paintings depicted it being like. Josh sat there at the table with a rather normal sized turkey that was kind of dry. He remembered the Thanksgivings that he had spent as his parent's house with his past girlfriends. The family dynamic had changed. His father had become a bitter old man and he had pushed Josh and the others away. “Oh well,” Josh said to himself and he ate his turkey and mashed potatoes by himself. He had to remind himself that he was in solitude and that he did not suffer loneliness.

Some time had passed and then there was a knock on the door. Josh wondered who it was and he got up from the table and the opened the front door. It was Mike. He stood there on the patio with a smile o his face. Mike Stedson. He was a real friend. Greg was with him, too.

“Josh. What's up man,” Mike said. He had a warm and friendly expression on his face. “You know that we couldn't just let you just be alone.”

“You sneaky bastard,” Josh said and he smiled. “Come in. There is some turkey there.”

“Sweet,” Mike said and he walked in. Greg came in behind him and he shut the door.

“Lock it, will you. It gets kinda cold in here if you don't,” Josh said to him.

“Hu...sure,” Greg said and he locked the door. He was a skinny man, but he was a hard worker and he was trustworthy.

They all sat at the table with its rather large chairs and they talked amongst themselves.

“So what did you have at you're place? The best stuff huh?” Josh asked Mike with some amusement.

“Yeah. Its always the best stuff,” Mike said. He was already eyeing the remains of the turkey on the table.

“Yeah, yeah. Well, there is some turkey here,” Josh said, also with some amusement.

“Like manna from Heaven,” Mike said.

Josh thought that that was rather funny, and somewhat appropriate to the situation. “So what brings you guys here?”

“Well, you know. I don't think that you should just be left alone, so I figured that I would come over and bring Greg here with me. With the stress that you might be going through, I thought that it would be a good idea,” Mike said with some thought.

“Yeah. Well, you thought right. At least I can spend some of my Thanksgiving day with you guys,” Josh said and his attitude was brightened.

They talked to each other and ate some of the turkey, rolls, and mashed potatoes. After they had finished, they sat at the table and they talked to each other for a while as the time passed. The atmosphere got darker and questions were risen in Josh's mind.

So...I have a question. Have you ever seen a ghost?” he asked Mike.

“No, and I don't believe in that stuff either, but my mother did. Or she might have had an experience with one,” Mike said with some thought.

“Really? What happened?” Josh asked.

“Well, my mother told me one time that when she was a little girl that she and her parents lived in a small house in the countryside. One day, her parents were going to go shopping and they waited for her in the car. She said that she had come outside and she came down the wooden steps, and when she came down the steps that something had grabbed her. It had reached out from between one of the middle steps and it grabbed her ankle. She said that it was hairy and that it had long claws. Then, after a moment, it just let her go. That's it. That is all that happened,” Mike said. He was running the memory of the story through his mind.

“Woah. That's it though? Did she see what it was?” Josh asked. He wanted to know.

“No. She said that she just felt it. You could only imagine what it really was,” Mike said.

“Yeah. I would rather not know.” And with that, he had no further questions about it.

“Well anyway, it has been fun being here. I expect to see you at work on Monday. I suppose that I should get back home now. I will take another one of those rolls though,” Mike said and he had a cheery expression on his face.

“Yeah. Take it, sure. I will be there bright and early,” Josh said and his mood was lifted again. Mike and Greg said their goodbyes and they walked out.

The next day, Josh came home from a walk around town. He walked through the door and then he turned and looked up and that was when he saw it. The dining room table was there and two of the large chairs had been pulled out. The original chairs for the table had been too small and he had gotten the larger chairs for it. He thought that they reminded him of The Knights Of The Round Table. It seemed as thought there were people sitting in them. It was as if they were waiting for him. It made him feel uneasy and he turned around and walked outside.



It was a Wednesday when he came home and he had an idea. He needed to lift his spirits. He decided that he would clean the house and he did so. He cleaned the place, then he straitened up his room. For some reason, he thought that he would move the alcohol server and sweep the area behind it. He slowly moved the alcohol server out and then he saw something. There were two loose wooden boards that were sitting there in the back corner off to the right behind the alcohol server. He thought that that was odd. He decided to investigate the area and he pulled up the boards with a butter knife. After he removed the boards, he saw what was in there. It was a hammer with blood stains on it. He knew what it was. It was the murder weapon.

“Oh no,” he said.

He saw something just then. It was in the corner of his eye. He looked over at it. There was a blue light coming from the guest bedroom again. He got up and walked over to it. He reached the small hallway that lead to the guest bedroom and then he slowed down. The blue light glowed and it was bright, and yet it was darker at the same time. It was as if it interfered with the natural light around it. He walked into the room and he turned and then he saw something standing there. In the strange ghostlight, a pale figure stood there in the room in a hunched position. It looked sort of like a man, but it was not human. It was skinny and emaciated looking and it was naked. It had hands with three fingers and claws that were bent inward some. Josh thought that they looked like crab claws. He saw the face then. It creature was bald and it had eyes that were in a diagonal position on its face. That mutated thing looked at him and Josh was so frightened that he ran out of the house.

Josh entered the house sometime later and the entity was gone. He called the police and told them what he had found. They found the body of the woman a few weeks later in the woods in Aurora. She looked just like Josh had imagined that she would. They found the man who killed her sometime later. His name was Martin Wayfield. He was the previous owner of the house that Josh currently lived in. Evidently, he was an abusive man and he drank a lot, and he had fits of rage. He was in an argument with his wife and he was in a drunken rage and he beat her head in with the hammer. After learning about all of that, Josh naturally wanted to move out and find another place to live. And the entity? He didn't know what to think about that. Maybe the entity lead him to do it. Maybe it affected reality, too.

Josh moved out of that house and he found another place further in town that was kind of nice, and there were nice people in town to socialize with. He continued on with his life.",1,1764020517.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Most prompts make ChatGPT sound robotic, stiff, or too polite.
So I kept tweaking tiny things — tone, structure, phrasing — until something clicked.

Here’s the simple structure that works every time:

Prompt Template:
“Write this like you’re explaining it to a friend over coffee.
Use everyday words.
Keep sentences short.
Make it natural, relaxed, and human.
Avoid any formal tone.
My topic: [Insert your topic].”

When I use this, the writing suddenly feels “alive.”
The rhythm is smoother.
The transitions feel natural.
It doesn’t sound like a homework essay anymore.

Example:

Normal Prompt:
“Explain blockchain technology in simple terms.”

Coffee Chat Prompt:
“Explain blockchain like you’re talking to a friend who hates tech jargon.”

The second version is way better.
It even added this analogy:
“Think of it like a shared digital notebook that no one can erase.”

If your AI outputs sound stiff or boring — try the “coffee chat” trick.
It works for writing, scripts, essays, emails, and even coding explanations.

I had like 2 ex partners that were able to reach that level of depth i needed but both ended up betraying me in some way. So I don’t know my soul feels very lonely. I guess the weird thing is when I’m away from others I feel maybe even less lonely. Seeing other people enjoy or have conversations about things I don’t care about makes me feel alone. It’s not even like I’m friends with superficial people, I just can’t get myself to care about casual things. Like I don’t care about uni, jobs, politics, my future, movies, basically nothing but the things i wrote at the beginning of this post.. maybe it just feels like nothing else speaks to my soul. And maybe it speaks to theirs so I’m not capable of seeing the beauty in them. But also it feels i’m the only person capable of feeling that beauty around me.. or maybe people just don’t talk about it. Like a touch, a bird, a song, a sentence, that’s what I care about… When it feels like everyone else cares about things as a whole but I care for only specific moments it feels weird like it feels like a barrier. I don’t enjoy conversations unless it’s about sharing feelings. I guess I enjoy hanging out with friends if there is an energy to it, like the sun is out or there’s rain and we dressed up all cute in our hats with steam from our drinks, or we’re creating a cozy atmosphere at home with homemade food and music etc. That’s what I like, I don’t know this all sounds so stupid probably.

I guess I don’t know what I’m missing. I enjoy some moments in life, like I saw a bird today and it got me emotional. I cuddled a friend yesterday and it felt so safe etc. But outside of those moments I’m not fulfilled, I have no dreams, I have no motivation, I don’t care about a lot of the things others seem to care about.

All criticism and feedback is welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read my excerpt! 🙏🏻

Through the snow-speckled trees, their limbs leafless and crooked, stood a figure in stoic anticipation. Kaelvorn. A descendant of the Brightmoon, he stalked the hollow woods of Greth on the night of the hunt. Damp blood and grit clung to the frons of his graywolf trench coat.

He stood tall and broad-shouldered, tapered at the waist. His hair—oak-brown and tied in a messy, loosely knotted bun—caught the faintest silver where the moon kissed the shaven sides of his head.

Etched markings of ancient runes were inked into the sides of his skull. No ordinary ink, vermilion-onyx, a symbolic mixture of the Blood Rites. It was the mark of the Sanctified Sanguine. 

The air was cold. Empty of birdsong. 
A thin whistle of wind drifted through Greth Hollow, and beneath it lingered the smell of smoke. The sparse villagers were burning incense—Lorkyus root. A small medicinal weed grown along the outskirts. Local druids claimed it could ward off the Remnants.

In the deafening quiet, Kaelvorn brushed his fingertips across the insignia. His touch slowed at the bottom edge of the sundered glyph—split like a blighted crescent. Faint light pulsed beneath the scar. A habit more than a remembrance.
It ran down his left eyebrow to his cheekbone, across features sculpted and subtly feminine. A deep scar. A burden not of flesh but of memory.
A reminder of his father—or the man he once believed him to be.

That was before.
Before the Veil began to open.

A crackle sounded in the distance.
Kaelvorn’s ears were sharp as a Sylvarian blade.

Tonight, the hunt was on.

On the seventh rising of the Veilmoon, the haunted husks of the Remnants slipped into the realm of the living. Not human. Beasts wearing the shapes of horrors, driven by thirst for nectar—the living essence of those the Veil had yet to claim.

The bounty for Remnant heads was meagre.
But Kaelvorn had no choice. Something inside him hungered—an ache only blood could soothe.
He did not know why the craving clung to him, nor why death tasted like sustenance.

Another crackle. Closer.
Kaelvorn crouched low, still as stone, senses sharpened to a needle’s point.
His warm, coffee-brown eyes dilated—the side-effect of his blood cocktail. He took another swig from the matte silver flask; the mixture burned like fresh embers, a blend of virgin moon blood and distilled alcohol. A rasping cough followed, but his senses sharpened further.

Time slowed almost to a standstill. Kaelvorn’s heartbeat thundered in his ears. In the still of the Veil, he waited.

Across his back hung a scabbard of obsidian black, strapped over his right shoulder. The sword within bore a gleaming sterling hilt, bright as the Evastar. The blade was long and slender, elegant despite its purpose. Running down its center was a vein of deep scarlet gem shard—the remembrance of the Crimson Rite. With each Remnant slain, the blade grew stronger, fed by the flame of the Veil.

Around his waist was a belt of elk skin, lighter than a raven’s feather and sturdier than boar hide. A simple pouch hung from his left hip, unremarkable but essential. Inside lay a vial of Old Blood, not for drinking, and a tattered note, its parchment crumpled and stained with age.

Kaelvorn unfolded the note with quiet care.
The ink, written in immaculate ancient cursive with the unmistakable quill of the Brightmoon, read:

“Fear not the dark, for shadows cannot fall where no light remains.”

He recited the words in a near whisper, head bowed, eyes closed.

Then—an audible, hollow pop as he uncorked the vial.

The Old Blood was thick and bright as red flame, half-gel, half-coagulate.
He drew a worn cloth from his breast pocket, its tip stiff with dried residue.
A slow dab.
A breath held.
Then he smoothed the syrupy crimson along the scarlet veins of the blade.

For a moment—silence.
Then the veins stirred, glowing from within.
A quiet tension trembled through the steel, like some ancient cruelty awakening after centuries of sleep.

Ravel—once a slave, once beaten to the edge of hollow—had stolen that vial without knowing its worth. He kept it out of spite, out of memory, out of one last act of rebellion. Only later did he live long enough to witness the Veil crack… long enough to place the Old Blood in the hands of the one soul he believed could see through the rot and illusion.

The one who might break the Echoes of Eternity.

“Ravel, you cunning old bastard.” Kaelvorn smirked in a brief thought of fond memory. 

The surrounding air became as still as night. Each breath Kaelvorn drew left a frosted trail, curling from his pursed mouth.

“You cowardly fucker. Such is the way of this life—reveal yourself!” Kaelvorn shouted.

From shadow, a hollow outline took shape. Almost man. Almost “purified.” The Remnant stood, lifeless yet alive, with milk-white eyes and abyssal black pupils. Its grin was wide, sharp-toothed, crooked, dagger-like.

A gaunt, hollow frame, radiating unpredictability. Fresh blood dripped from the corners of its mouth like tears, settling on its chin like frost on stone. The scent of living nectar was intoxicating, a maddening ecstasy through the holes where nostrils should have been.

Kaelvorn flexed his fingers around the hilt. Every movement calculated. The fight was about to begin.

With a flash of lightning speed, the Remnant darted toward Kaelvorn, almost disappearing entirely as it zagged right to left in quick succession. The fingers of an old man, transformed into claws. The quiet statuesque silhouette, now frenzied.

A shrill, piercing like needle tips, bellowed from the Remnant. Almost speaking of ancient torment, the wail honed into Kaelvorn's ears. In an instant, the blade was unseathed. He pirouetted, fleet footed, no boot mark was left in the snow. 

As if by instinct, Kaelvorn spun around, held his sword up and deflected a hard blow from the claws of the Remnants' furious swipe. A clang rattled out, Kaelvorn slashed aggressively, aiming for the neck of the Remnant, but in a breathless moment, nothing. 

Kaelvorn panted, eyes darting quickly from left to right in search of the monstrosity.

Crouched on his haunches, breath steady an eerie silence insures. An intense heavy gust of wind, whips through the trees, Kaelvorn's hair is blown wildly, strands clinging to his high cheekbones. 


“Gone. Fuck!” Kaelvorn grunts softly to himself. The Remnant vanished, if momentarily.

A flash in the corner of his eye, a grim dark shape appeared, and a heinous shriek bellowed from the gaunt mouth of the Remnant. The sound was vile, crows flapped from the tree limbs they perch on. 
Kaelvorn's gaze hardened, his focus narrowed. 

The distance was closed in an instant. The Remnant charged forward with intensity that knocked Kaelvorn onto his arse. 
Claws reaching for his neck, mouth agape, it's breath was rancid, like decaying meat, it permeated out like a toxic vapour into Kaelvorn's face. He could barely hold back a gag. Dagger like teeth zeroed in for the soft jugular of Kaelvorn. His nectar. So close, so soft. So nourishing. 

The strength from the Remnant was staggering, stronger than the heftiest smith's arms, hammering anvil day and night. 
Although it's stature was decrepit and bore the resemblance of fragility, Kaelvorn felt the weight against his chest. Anxiety spurned inside him.

As beast jaws snapped, inching closer the apple of Kaelvorn's neck, his scar, the glyph of a blighted crescent pulsated. 

As if bearing the strength of all Elarion, Kaelvorn thrust his left hand around the creature's throat. He paused for a moment, the two locked eyes. Predator and prey. The hunt was on. 

A small audible gasp escaped the mouth of the Remnant, a spluttering of blood and bile oozed from the creature's contorted grin as Kaelvorn’s grip tightened. Kaelvorn pulled the Remnant forward, angling close to his forehead, he lent upwards, towards the hideous beast. In a cold and defiantly voice, Kaelvorn whispered into the ear of the Remnant. “Vile servant of the Veilkin. Go to hell, and take your soul and fragments with you”. 

With a devastating thrust, Kaelvorn drove the sterling blade, glistening under the pristine moonlight, adorning scarlet gem stones into the throat of the Remnant. Straight up and out through the top of its skull. Crushing bone, carving through flesh, tendons, ligaments. 

Quickly he withdrew the blade, a gory trail of visceral splattered Kaelvorn across his face. Traces of blood, coagulated, warm, met the pulsating blighted crescent glyph sundered unto his cheek bone.

Kaelvorn felt thirsty, he felt alive. The hunt was on.

The Seven Fools

Jane slept lightly.

Not badly — just in that thin, fragile way people sleep when their mind hasn’t quite caught up to their body. The snow had thickened overnight, soft and wet against the window, muting the city into something gentler than it deserved to be.

Her alarm buzzed.

She blinked awake.

For half a second, everything was normal.

Then she saw the drawer.

Not open.

But not where it had been.

It sat three inches left of its usual position — a tiny shift, barely visible unless you lived with the thing long enough to know its habits. And drawers, by definition, should not have habits.

Jane stared at it.

“Oh, come on,” she whispered.

The drawer did nothing.
Which made everything worse.

She got up slowly, the floor cold beneath her feet.
Approached the drawer like it might bolt.

She pulled it open.

Inside, the Tesco receipt lay exactly where she’d left it.
Except now there were seven new creases pressed into it, perfectly spaced, like someone had folded and unfolded it seven times in neat, deliberate precision.

As if counting.

Jane touched one crease with her fingertip.
Her skin prickled.

At the bottom of the receipt, below the last line she remembered, was a new phrase:

THE SEVEN FOOLS REMEMBER.

Her throat tightened.

“No,” she said aloud.
“No, thank you. Absolutely not today.”

She slammed the drawer shut.

It agreed.
Stayed shut.

But the words stuck behind her ribs like ice.

She showered.
Dressed.
Made coffee.
Avoided the drawer like avoiding a ghost in a hallway.

She had to be at the deli by nine.

Walking through slush on the pavement, she tried to focus on normal things:

the smell of brewing coffee from the café on the corner

someone de-icing their car with a Tesco clubcard

a cyclist yelling at nobody in particular


Normal.
Daily.
Human.

Then she turned onto the high street.

And froze.

Across from the bus stop, a mural she’d never noticed before — a faded, peeling bit of wall art on the side of a laundrette — showed seven figures marching in a crooked little line. Old cartoon style. Painted decades ago.

They wore tall, floppy hats.
Carried mismatched instruments.
One trailed a balloon.
Another held nothing at all.
Their faces were simple circles with dots for eyes.

Under them, half-erased by time and graffiti, read:

The Seven Fools of Cricklewood
(Local Mummers, 1978)

Jane exhaled sharply.

Not magical.
Not impossible.
A coincidence.
A weird, completely normal, very London coincidence.

But the timing felt like a hand tapping her shoulder.

She tore her gaze away and kept walking.
Faster.

Halfway to the deli, a memory surfaced.

Not a vision — not like the hill, not like Portugal —
but a childhood snippet she hadn’t thought about in years.

Her mum sitting at the edge of her bed when she was seven or eight, hair in rollers, telling her stories about the village where her mum grew up. Stories that were always a little strange around the edges.

“And every spring,” Nova had said, “the Seven Fools would parade through the square. They weren’t real fools, mind, just the local men dressed up for the festival. They carried drums and spoons and old boots tied to sticks. They’d make a racket loud enough to wake the dead.”

“Why?” little Jane had asked.

Nova shrugged.
“To scare off whatever was haunting the winter.”

“What was haunting the winter?”

Her mother had paused for a long moment.

Then said softly:

“Memory, mostly.”

Jane stumbled.

The word hit too close to what she’d seen on the receipt.
Too close to the drawer shifting.
Too close to the feeling that her memories were being nudged, rearranged, questioned.

She reached the deli and grabbed the doorknob with slightly shaking fingers.

Inside, warmth.
Brine.
Bread.
Rami.

Normal.

But she felt the day humming differently —
not loud, not frightening —
just full in a way small days never were.

Rami glanced at her the moment she stepped in.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he said.

“Just… snow,” Jane managed.

“Ah,” he nodded. “Yes. Snow often has that effect. Melancholy weather.”

She hung her coat.
Tied her apron.
Tried to breathe.

As she stepped behind the counter, Rami handed her a stack of takeaway menus.

“Put these out front,” he said, “and for the love of pickles, ignore the old men arguing about football. They do not require your intervention.”

Jane nodded and moved toward the door.

But when she pushed it open, a gust of cold air swept in —
and the menus slipped from her hand.

They scattered across the pavement.

Most drifted flat onto the wet ground.

But seven of them — exactly seven —
landed upright against the wall, perfectly aligned.

Jane stared.

Not magic.
Not physically impossible.
Just… uncanny in its precision.

A resonance.

A big-day moment.

She knelt to gather them, her breath steady but her pulse uncomfortably loud in her ears.

When she straightened, one menu at the bottom of the stack looked different — slightly smudged, damp at the corner, ink bleeding.

Someone — a customer, a child, a passerby — had drawn a little face on it.

A circle.
Two dots for eyes.

A fool’s face.

Jane’s breath hitched.

Her hands trembled just once before she steadied them.

She took the menus inside, placed them neatly on the counter, and told herself — firmly, insistently — that it was all coincidence.

And maybe it was.

But as the snow continued falling, soft and steady, she felt it:

The universe had taken a step toward her.

A big step.

And Chapter Five had only just begun.

—

By midmorning, the deli felt louder than usual.

Not actually louder — the same clatter of knives, the same low hum of the fridge and hiss of the espresso machine —
but louder to her.
Like all the sounds were pushing in from the edges.

Jane sliced bread.
Wrapped a pastrami.
Wiped the counter.

Normal actions.

But the world around her had begun to blur in micro-ways, as though someone kept nudging the focus ring on a camera lens.

Not enough to distort.
Not enough to draw attention.
Just enough that her brain whispered:
Are you sure you’re here? Are you sure you’re steady?

She blinked hard.

The deli lights felt too bright.
The hum of the cooler too sharp.
Her pulse too loud.

A woman ordered a tuna sandwich.
Jane nodded, but her hands paused halfway to the bread.

She stared at them.

Her fingers didn’t shake, not really, but they looked…fizzy.
Not visibly vibrating — more like the sensation one gets after standing up too quickly, that odd dizziness before the world returns to its proper shape.

“Jane?”
Rami’s voice cut gently through it.
“You need water. Sit.”

She nodded, grateful.
Backed away from the counter.
The floor seemed to bend mildly under her feet — not moving, not shifting, but tilting, just enough to unsettle her balance.

A moment of gravity slipping.

She reached the tiny staff chair beside the racks of crisps.
Lowered herself slowly.

Her breath shuddered once.

Not an anxiety attack — this was different.
Less panic, more… recognition.
That strange, hushed, internal click that says:
Something is about to come back. Whether you like it or not.

She swallowed.

Her jacket hung on the hook near the door.
Her dad’s rally jacket.

She didn’t think — she just moved toward it, hands shaking now in truth, fumbling slightly with the pockets.

She reached in.

Her fingers brushed something soft.

Yesterday’s napkin.

The one she’d carried home.
The grounding object from her small-day moment.

She pulled it out.

But it wasn’t the same.

Yesterday, it had been blank.
White.
Ordinary.

Now, stamped faintly in the lower corner — like an old café imprint or something pressed by accident — was a sun symbol.

Not the British kind.
Not a doodle.
Not something the deli stocked.

But unmistakably, undeniably—

a seven-pointed Zia sun.

Seven points.
Seven rays.
One deliberately missing.

Her father’s state symbol.
Her summers.
Her childhood.
The emblem he used to draw on the corner of postcards when she was little.

Except the original Zia symbol had four main arms, each with four rays.

This one had seven, one side faded, incomplete.

Her breath left her in a small, shocked exhale.

The napkin trembled slightly in her hand.

Not from movement.
From meaning.

Her dad used to say:
“Every rider’s got a sun they follow. Even if it’s busted, even if it’s missing a piece.”

She stared at the seven-point sun.
Missing one.

One point gone.

Seven fools.
Seven folds.
Seven menus.
Seven creases in the drawer.

The deli blurred again, tilting softly around her.

She grabbed the edge of the counter for balance.

Not fainting.
Not panicking.
Just—
caught between memory and moment, past and present, meaning and coincidence.

Rami’s voice reached her, worried.
“Jane? Sit. Now. You’re white as ricotta.”

But she barely heard him.

Because the napkin’s ink looked like it hadn’t been stamped.
It looked absorbed.
As if the paper had held it a long time.
As if the symbol had always been there and she’d only just now learned to see it.

Her heart hammered once —
not fear,
but recognition.

The universe was answering her.
And it was answering in Zia.


---


The napkin trembled in her fingers.

A seven-point Zia sun.
Missing a ray.
Like a warning.
Or a memory.
Or both.

Her vision blurred again around the edges — not spinning this time, but tightening, like the world was pulling into a narrower funnel.

She drew in a sharp breath.

And then —

Hands.
Several hands.

Someone pulled the napkin gently from her grip.
Someone else steadied her elbow.
A warm palm pressed between her shoulder blades.

Voices converged, muffled, overlapping:

“Easy—”
“Sit her down—”
“Breathe, love—”

By the time her vision settled, she was already sitting in the little staff chair beside the crisps, her jacket draped over her knees like a blanket.

Rami hovered in front of her.

Except—

Not the Rami she knew.

Not the warm, booming, pickle-loving man who believed chicken salad was the spine of the universe.

For a split second — a single, breath-held moment — the lighting fell strange across his face. Shadow carved different lines there. His eyes looked deeper, older, tired in a way she’d never noticed.

As if he was holding something he never intended anyone to see.

Secretive.
Guarded.
Heavy.

Almost…
dark.

She blinked.
And just like that, the impression dissolved.

Rami was simply Rami again — worried eyebrows, flour on his sleeve, the apron slightly crooked as always.

He crouched to eye level, voice low and steady.

“Jane. Look at me.”

She did.

“You fainted,” he said, though she hadn’t exactly fainted — just slid sideways into some kind of internal freefall. “Are you dizzy now? Nauseous? Chest tight?”

She shook her head.
Her breath still stuttered slightly.

“You scared the life out of me,” he muttered, softer than before. “Thought you were about to topple into the olives.”

Someone behind him made a sympathetic clucking noise.
A pair of elderly customers hovered nearby, looking like they were watching a hospital drama.

Jane tried to speak.
Her mouth felt too dry.

“I’m fine,” she managed. “Just… stood too fast.”

Rami’s gaze sharpened.

His voice dropped again — so low she almost didn’t hear it.

“You’re lying.”

She swallowed, throat scraping like paper.

He didn’t sound accusing.
He sounded… certain.

Like someone who recognized the lie from personal experience.

She looked down at her hands.
They were still trembling.
A fine, shimmering tremor.

The napkin — that impossible, too-familiar symbol — lay folded on the counter beside her.

Rami turned, picked it up, and examined the corner.

His expression tightened — only slightly, barely noticeable — but she caught it.

A microsecond flicker.

Recognition.
Or fear.
Or something adjacent to both.

He dropped the napkin on the table a little too quickly.

“You should go home,” he said abruptly.

“What? No—”

“Now,” he said, firmer. “You’re not slicing anything today. I’d like all my employees to keep their fingers.”

He attempted a smile.

It didn’t reach his eyes.

And for a moment — just a thin, stretched moment — she saw the shadow again.
Not evil.
Just… buried.
Like a man who had made peace with something long ago and never wanted to revisit it.

A secret crouched in his chest like a locked drawer.

Jane stood shakily.
Her legs felt wrong — like they were trying to remember where the ground was.

“Rami,” she said quietly, “did… did you see that symbol before?”

He flinched.

Almost imperceptibly.

Then he cleared his throat, wiped his hands on his apron, and said briskly:

“No idea what you’re talking about. Go on now. Rest.”

He turned away too quickly.

And Jane, still lightheaded, still shaken, still clutching her father’s rally jacket to her chest, felt certainty settle into her bones:

Rami knew something.
Something he wasn’t supposed to show.
Something he’d clearly learned how to hide.

And the universe — patient, scaled, resonant — had just placed her directly in front of it.


---

Absolutely, Sean — here is the Chapter Five closing movement, written with:

big-day resonance

Jane’s self-medication spiral (grounded, gentle, no glamorizing)

the universe flowing through her in symbolic, atmospheric waves

pieces of the honey-pot pattern surfacing

a chapter ending that stops—clean, sudden, intentional, exactly the way you want your chapter breaks


This is the final movement of Chapter Five.


---

Jane left the deli an hour early.

Rami insisted.
He didn’t meet her eyes when he said it.

The snow had turned slushy, the sky falling into that late-afternoon grey that made London look like it was running low on ink. She pulled her dad’s rally jacket tighter around her, the napkin tucked in the inside pocket like a smuggled secret.

Her feet carried her home automatically.

Three blocks.
A turn.
The crossing by the betting shop.
Up the narrow stairwell.

Key in lock.

Inside, the flat held its breath.

She didn’t turn on the light.

She walked straight to her bedside drawer—
stopped herself—
turned instead to the window.

Fine.
If the world wanted to collapse inward on her again, it could wait until she had something in her system.

She dug out her strawberry vape pen.

Held it.
Stared at it.
Told herself:

Small inhale. Small night. Small mercy.

She took one long pull.
Then another.
Then one she did not count.

Her muscles unclenched all at once.

The tension in her bones loosened.
Her mind thinned at the edges, softening like wet paper.
Her breath quieted.
Everything quieted.

And then—

The universe flowed through the crack.

Not loudly.
Not violently.
Not with visions or shocks or glowing symbols.

Just—

Color.

Patterns.

The faint outline of the seven-point sun drifting behind her eyelids whenever she blinked.

A fleeting flicker of the Seven Fools mural.
A memory-voice saying memory haunts the winter.
The feeling of her mother’s laugh on that cliff.
The way Rami had tensed—like he was bracing for an old wound to open.
Snow.
Falling.
Turning.
Swirling with meaning she couldn’t hold onto.

The drawer—
(had it moved again?)
—glimmered in the corner of her vision like something underwater.

She sat on the floor.

The vape pen warm in her palm.
Her heart loud but no longer frantic.
The world shimmering at the edges.

Pieces.
So many pieces.
None of them fitting yet.

The universe was sweet.
Dangerous in its gentleness.
Inviting.

Her thoughts drifted loose, unanchored, barely coherent.

She whispered, without knowing why:

“Who are the Seven Fools?”

The snow outside fell harder.

A flake tapped the glass—
just one—
leaving a tiny, perfect seven-pointed pattern before melting.

She blinked.

It looked like—
No.
No, she was high.
It meant nothing.
Everything meant nothing and too much.

She crawled into bed fully clothed, jacket and all, the napkin still in her pocket, the seven-point sun pressed against her hip like a heartbeat.

Sleep took her before she meant to let it.

And—

she forgot.

Not everything.
Not the world.
Not the deli or the snow or her name.

Just the edges.
Just the coherence.
Just enough.

The universe had flowed through her …

…and left her with residue she couldn’t hold when morning came.

She would remember nothing clearly.

But we — the reader — remember every piece.

And that is where
Chapter Five stops.

Clean.
Abrupt.
Like a held breath cut short.

So I’ve owned my SAGE impress for a few months now. I normally use grind coffee a medium house blend.
The internal grind is 4 the external grind is 10 and I get about 24 to 26 seconds of shot time.
I feel like the coffee I’m using is not up to a good standard as the coffee beans are slightly small in size so I have bought a different brand called Rounton coffee, but same again the beans look small.
at one point i did buy these beans called “brazilian love affair” Best beans by far but unfortunately i can’t find that again.
QUESTIONS:
how do I dial in coffee without having to make about 10 to 15 espresso double shots? It’s such a big waste.
What beans do you recommend? I don’t mind the price because I have paid between 20 - 40 per 1kg bag.
Also, I am trying to make pressure gauge needle stay at the “1pm” mark but i’m only getting it at like the “11am” mark.

1p5tv0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/StereoMontreal/comments/1p5tv0e/dear_stereo_my_weekend_was_banging/,"Dear Stereo, my weekend was banging!","This is going to take a while - grab a coffee, tea or something stronger if you wish. I purposely travelled in and booked the two consecutive nights for Kevin Saunderson and Patrice Bäumel. Hernan was a beautiful bonus.

Let’s set the record - Stereo isn’t a club; it’s an institution, and the fact it’s in Montreal makes it more illustrious (as an outsider, the city is awesome - one for another day). It doesn’t carry the NYC/Berlin weight of expectation, or snobbery.

For frames of reference - Male, 41 - I did from 5:30-finish for Kevin Saunderson. Sober aside from the hangover. Then I did 3:45- 8:00 on Sunday morning, went back to my Airbnb, watched some shit, snoozed a bit, then headed out for food and a couple of beers, before heading back around 4ish. I was expecting tiredness, age and a lack of enablement to struggle beyond 8. More on that below.

The club tropes exist, but for example, the letchy men seem to be less and less intense - maybe it’s the price point or the bouncers are just on it (that’s a weird focus, but, erm yeah!).

The dance floor is so well respected. Even when rammed, the occasional knocks are met with friendly yet apologetic acknowledgements, even those who have jaws swinging like a pendulum. It is part of Stereo’s charm!

The crowd was varied throughout the… marathon. I found the crowd to be a little bit older/mature than other places, but it certainly flipped thought the 24 hours, for the solo Patrick bit it was younger for sure. Maybe that’s part of a 26 year old institution thing.

The toilets are positively good, but there is more respect needed from patrons - imagine the person serving you is the person cleaning the toilets. It’s a minor gripe, and one that is universal, but to reiterate, the experience is good compared to crime scenes we’ve all witnessed.

Maybe men grouping at one end of the downstairs toilets by the urinals can be intimidating irrespective of gender.

StereoBar being opened, and again for a busy night and more of a one off, makes sense, I reckon that gave me as an older clubber a couple of hours extra. Sitting down, having a beer and having the occasional thrash was great. I also like that Stereo is alcohol free, but optionality on a marathon is great, coupled with the space and sound to enjoy the music. 

Kevin Saunderson - didn’t see enough of Lil’Louis - Tune selection, pace, roadshow - great - some of the mixing could have been be better. To see one of the Belleville Three is always a pleasure - that’s my experience outlook - Kevin Saunderson in particular does a lot for the scene. He played before a Lions game (NFL) - watching techno being smashed out in front of 70,000 people is inspiring for a genre that cycles a lot. I saw someone unjustly describe his set as EDM. I have a personal opinion on EDM that should get isolated for other styles - DeadMau5, Calvin Harris, DJ Hype and all those melts. There was a lot of Chicago and Detroit in that set, and both are related, but there is still nuance - however, I felt the sound system was put to good use.

Patrice & Hernan - where do you start with 18 hours - and I was there for 11 hours at best.

Patrice on his solo set was clean, layered and pounding - he avoided deeper, darker and more complex mixes - with hindsight a good thing, because later on - shit got real. As Stereo themselves pushed - it’s a marathon not a sprint. The b2b was epic with a consistent tempo and then in the b2b2b it got real heavy and nuanced, and the tempo got hot and flailed around nicely with Kora doing a great job with some seasoned pros - I’ll be following Kora closely - not that I’m some authority here.

I didn’t do Herman’s solo set. I had to preserve this body. I thought I might get 4 hours from me in the late afternoon/evening, but I got over 6 which I’ll take. And Herman impressed in both sessions. More punishing on the pace than I anticipated from my pre-listening. Maybe I didn’t hear enough breadth. But actually- that excites me. There isn’t a guarantee of what he’s going to do, similar to Patrice - which is, ultimately why they work extremely well together!! Then as the listener you are left open to the journey. Ultimately that’s why I’m so invested in this shit. 

Stereo, I’ll be back, not sure when… but it’s going to happen.",4,1764019952.0,StereoMontreal,2,1.0,False
1p5tstk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1p5tstk/best_way_to_find_out_if_im_on_a_friends_messy/,Best way to find out if I'm on a friend's messy list without making it weird?,"I've tried writing this post several times the past week, and kept deleting it.  I tend to get a bit wordy, so I've cut it down out a lot (and it's still pretty long).  And this is anonymous, for obvious reasons...

I am a woman, 30's, single and planning on keeping it that way, heterosexual but deeply, deeply demisexual.  I dated in the past, but gave up with that just before Covid got serious, and haven't looked back sense.  I do not miss dating, and don't want to try again.  I've also never really experienced physical intimacy before, beyond kissing, FWIW, and that doesn't bother me.  Through high school and college and in my 20's, everyone (including my entire family) thought I was a lesbian (no).  Now most people think I'm ace (no) and neurodivergent (maybe...).  There's nothing wrong with any of those!  But contrary to what people say, I AM attracted to men...or rather...I'm attracted to A man...

I've had this friend (let's call her V) since we were really young.  She's amazing, and we're still really good friends.  I would never, ever want to do anything to jeopardize our friendship. At the end of high school she started dating a guy (let's call him B) and he's been around ever since.  B is a great guy.  He's funny, he's smart, he's incredibly caring and sweet and kind and empathetic.  He genuinely loves to be helpful, he's helped me move (several times), if I need a ride to the airport, or home from an icky doctor's appointment, B is my guy.  He loves planning trips, events, and parties, we've gone on vacations and road trips together, I often go hiking and to the beach with him and V in the summer, and in the winter my friends all have an annual cozy getaway trip between Thanksgiving and Christmas that is my favorite part of the holidays, B often plans most of that trip.  I have a lot of medical particulars and no matter where we go or what we're doing, he always remembers all of them.  V is still, and will always be, my friend first, but I consider B to be the closest male friend I have in the world.

Recently (about a month ago) I was having coffee with V and another friend, and V told us that her and B were opening their relationship a bit to explore their sexuality and experiment more.  Apparently they've gone on swinger dates with other couples, and to a club a few times.  Knowing V, It wasn't that shocking, really, and she seemed really happy, so we were supportive.  Then V told us that her and B were thinking about trying solo dating soon, as V is interested in harboring a more intimate and personal long-term wlw relationship, and what's good for the goose is good for the gander so...B also has the freedom to date separate from V now, too...

I'm sure everyone has put this two piece jigsaw puzzle together by now, but since that day with V, I can't stop thinking about how the possibility of intimacy with B is on the table...maybe?

I have said nothing about this to V in the past month but suddenly my dormant libido has ignited.  I can't stop thinking about it!  I don't have a strong libido, normally, and don't even participate in self pleasure all that frequently, but this past month it's like I can't stop, and I keep thinking about the same thing...(sex with B).  V has always said he's very generous and passionate, and I don't doubt it, and now the idea that I could possibly experience it for myself has taken hold in my brain and I can't move on.

So, for the past few weeks I have been consuming ENM content, of which 95% doesn't really apply to me, but I'm trying to learn and understand what I can.  And after all that, here comes my actual question:

I see lots of ENM couples have a ""Messy list"".  People like coworkers or close friends who are persona non-grata to the open couple's dynamic.  I understand why people have these lists.  I would hate to ruin my friend group by making things weird...so what's the best way to approach V and ask her about if I'm on her messy list for B?  I know I could just be blunt about it.  ""Hey V, now that you and B are in an open relationship, what would you think about me getting a night with him every once in a while?"" I honestly think she might be ok with it...she knows me and my history, and my history with B.  But I would be absolutely mortified if asking did not go well and things got weird between us and our friend group.  I've even told myself half a dozen times in the last two weeks to just let it go and move on, but...here I am, still thinking about it...kind of a lot.

Our winter getaway is fast approaching and I feel like I need to get myself sorted out before then, one way or another!  So what would you all do?  ",3,1764019809.0,nonmonogamy,7,1.0,False

I was recently admitted to the hospital for the first time this past October with acute diverticulitis with a microperforation of the sigmoid colon. Scheduling a colonscopy for early next year.

I am 32 years old male, never have I had any GI issue or other medical problem. I eat healthy and exercise (wife is my witness lol!)

Key for me is here although the docs say no strong heridatry component: My mother has had over 20 episodes since her 40s, including sigmoid colon removal, and still struggles.

Most of my normal diet consists of yogurt every morning for like the last 10 years lol, sometimes oatmeal/peanut butter, eggs, or fruit like a banana. Lunch tends to be something light including some fruit, or dinner leftovers. Most dinners are grilled chicken, some carb, and a veggie we love brussel sprouts and asparagus.

Side note: coffee may be a bad trigger for me? Anyone else experience this

One month later I am now having a 2nd mild flare-up, the doctors from the hospital are recommending I undergo another round of antibiotics.

I am starting to think this old addage about a poor diet contributing to this condition is just untrue, and even the doctors I've seen have admitted we still do not fully comprehend the causes of this condition.

So what the heck? Why are younger & younger folks coming down with this, maybe a combination of factors including our heavily processed foods over the course of many many years? Is this a USA issue?

Any advice is truly appreciated.  This right now feels so random and out of nowhere for me and sounds like some others around my age.",1,1764019594.0,Diverticulitis,2,1.0,False

You’d throw up a Facebook ad, get a few clicks for less than a quid each, and boom  -  leads would pour in.

Back then, you didn’t need to be a full-blown marketing expert. 

You just needed a decent offer, a few ads, and a bit of confidence behind the camera. 

But somewhere along the way, things changed.

The same $10 a day ad budget that used to bring in 100 leads now barely gets you ten. 

Email open rates tanked. 

Social media went from a place people discovered things to a place people scroll through without really caring.

And the big one  -  webinars.

Man, webinars used to be gold. 

Everyone said, “Host a live webinar! It’s the best way to sell high-ticket offers.”

So, like everyone else, I did.

I’d spend days (sometimes weeks) building the perfect funnel. 

Ads to a registration page, follow-up reminders, live room setup, slide design, automation, the whole lot. 

Then I’d go live, full of energy and nerves, hoping people would show up.

And sometimes they did  -  sort of.

I’d get 200 signups. 

Maybe 40 would actually attend live. 

Out of those, 10 might stay until the pitch. 

Out of those 10, maybe one person would buy.

If I was lucky.

By the time I added up ad spend, email tools, webinar software, and all the time I’d put in, I was lucky to break even. 

And I wasn’t alone  -  everyone I spoke to in marketing was feeling the same thing.

It wasn’t the offer. 

It wasn’t the slides. 

It wasn’t even the delivery.

It was the system.

The whole “live webinar funnel” model that used to work five years ago was now crumbling. 

The market changed. 

People got smarter. 

Attention got shorter. 

And ads got way more expensive.

# The Hidden Costs No One Tells You About

People online love to shout about their “six-figure webinar launch.”

What they don’t tell you is what it *costs* to get there.

Let’s say you want 1,000 people to register for your live webinar. 

That’s not a lot, right?

If your ad costs average $3 a signup (which is pretty normal now), that’s $3,000 just in ads.

And here’s the thing… only about 25% of those people actually show up live.

So you’ve just spent $3,000 to get 250 live viewers.

Out of those, maybe 10% will buy something if you’re really good. 

That’s 25 customers.

If you’re selling something like a $297 product, that’s $7,425 in sales.

Sounds alright, until you take out:

* $3,000 in ad spend  
* $200 for webinar software  
* $300 in email software  
* $100 or more for tools like landing page builders, video hosting, etc.  
* And don’t forget your time (which you’ll never get back)  

Suddenly that “six-figure launch strategy” starts to look a bit grim.

And that’s assuming everything *goes right*  \-  no tech issues, no no-shows, no awkward silences or slides that won’t load.

The truth is, live webinars are unpredictable. 

One dodgy internet connection or missed reminder email can throw the whole thing off.

And when you realise you only get *one shot* to make it work, it’s stressful as hell.

# The Time-to-Conversion Problem

Another thing people don’t talk about enough is *how long it takes* to turn someone from a webinar viewer into a paying customer.

Live webinars create a “moment.” You’re hoping people buy *right there and then*  \-  but most don’t. 

They say they’ll “think about it” and vanish into the internet.

Then you send follow-up emails, maybe a replay, and hope they come back.

Sometimes they do  -  days or even weeks later. 

But usually? 

Crickets.

That means you’re constantly running ads just to refill the funnel with fresh leads. 

It’s like pouring water into a bucket full of holes.

That’s why so many business owners burn out trying to “scale.” 

It’s not because their product is bad  -  it’s because they’re trapped in a system that’s working against them.

# The Setup Stress

And don’t even get me started on the setup.

The amount of moving parts in a traditional webinar funnel is ridiculous. You’ve got:

* Ads and targeting  
* Registration pages  
* Confirmation emails  
* Reminder sequences  
* Webinar software setup  
* Slides and presentation  
* Replay pages  
* Follow-up sequences  
* Tracking and analytics  

Miss one small step, and the whole thing falls apart.

I can’t tell you how many times I’d run a “perfect” webinar  -  only to find out the replay link was broken, or the payment button didn’t fire, or the emails didn’t send.

All that effort… wasted.

That’s when I started asking myself: *is this really the best way to sell online anymore?*

Because it sure didn’t feel like it.

# The Realisation: It’s Not the Product, It’s the Process

For the longest time, I thought maybe I just needed better slides. 

Or more excitement. 

Or a fancier funnel.

But it wasn’t that at all.

It was the model itself.

Live webinars *used to* work because there weren’t as many people doing them. 

They were new. 

They felt exclusive.

Now? 

Everyone’s doing them. 

Every other ad you see on Facebook is another “free live masterclass” that’s basically a sales pitch in disguise.

People have caught on. 

They know what’s coming. 

They’ll even register just to get the replay link, skip straight to the pitch, and then ghost.

Meanwhile, you’re left stressing, running ads, paying for tools, and hoping next time’s “the one.”

That’s when it finally clicked for me  -  what if I stopped trying to *chase people* and built something that worked on *their terms* instead?

Something they could watch whenever they wanted.

Something that didn’t rely on fake countdowns or fake chat windows.

Something that actually delivered value  -  and still sold.

That’s when everything started to change.

# The Lightbulb Moment

I didn’t plan to build some new fancy system. 

Honestly, I was just fed up.

I’d spent months running the same exhausting routine  -  setting up live webinars, stressing over ad costs, watching attendance drop lower every time.

Then one day, after another “meh” live event, I thought, *what if I just recorded it instead?*

That’s literally how it started.

No huge plan, no grand strategy. 

Just me thinking, “Screw it  -  I’ll record it properly, edit out the mistakes, and put it up for people to buy whenever they want.”

So I sat down, hit record, and took my time. 

No pressure.

If I messed up a line, I re-shot it. 

If a slide felt off, I fixed it. 

I could pause for a sip of coffee, add an example, or throw in a story that wouldn’t have fit in a live version.

It felt *different*. 

Calmer. 

Smarter.

And when I watched it back, I realised something important:

This was better. Like, way better.

The pacing was smoother. 

The flow made sense. 

There were no awkward pauses or filler moments. 

It actually felt like a proper training  -  something you’d pay for.

That’s when it hit me  -  maybe *that’s* the problem with the traditional model.

Live webinars aren’t built for quality. They’re built for performance.

You’re trying to teach *and* sell *and* entertain, all while hoping your mic doesn’t cut out.

But when you pre-record it, you can focus purely on delivering value. 

You can create something polished that people actually enjoy watching.

And when the quality goes up, so do conversions.

# The First Test

I decided to test it properly.

Instead of running another free “live” webinar, I put together a small sales page and listed access to my recording for $7.

That’s it. 

No crazy upsell funnel, no hidden countdown timer, no fake “we’re live now!” popup.

Just “Watch my full training on how to double your client leads using email  -  instant access, $7.”

I ran a few Facebook ads to it  -  nothing major. 

Maybe $50 total.

Within the first day, I had 10 sales.

By the end of the week, over 40.

It sounds small, but that was $280 in sales  -  from a $50 ad spend.

And here’s the wild part  -  every single one of those customers paid attention.

They watched the whole thing. 

They asked questions. 

They emailed me for advice.

It wasn’t just “freebie seekers” looking for a quick tip  -  they actually cared.

And a few days later, some of them started buying my higher-ticket service too.

That’s when I knew I was onto something.

# How It Became a System

After that, I refined the process.

Instead of treating the webinar as a one-off, I started building a mini funnel around it  -  nothing overcomplicated, just smart.

When someone bought the webinar, they went through a checkout page that included a little box offering something extra  -  a **PDF guide** based on the same training for $11.

That tiny offer boosted my average order value by almost 40%.

Why? 

Because people who buy educational content love having something they can download or print out.

Then, after they got access to the video, I added a section below the player that said:

“You may also be interested in…”

…and linked to a few other digital products I’d made  -  things like templates, scripts, and short courses.

Suddenly, every buyer wasn’t just worth $7  -  they were worth $20–$40 on average.

All from a funnel that ran on autopilot.

# Why It Works So Well

I think the reason this model works is because it feels *natural*.

When someone pays to access a webinar  -  even if it’s just $5 or $7  -  they’re saying, “I value this enough to invest in it.”

That changes everything.

They don’t scroll past it…

They don’t forget to attend…

They actually *watch*.

And because they’re engaged, your teaching builds trust.

When you mention your main offer  -  whether it’s a service, software, or coaching  -  it doesn’t feel salesy. 

It just makes sense.

It’s like “Hey, you’ve just learned how to do this yourself. If you want us to do it for you, here’s the link.”

No pressure. 

No hard close.

Just a logical next step.

And the beauty of it? 

You only have to record it once.

That single video can bring in sales every day for months or even years.

# How I Built the Rest

Once I saw how well the first one worked, I built a few more.

A fitness coach friend of mine tried it too. 

She made a 90-minute webinar called *“30-Day Fat Loss Blueprint”*  \-  just $9 to watch anytime.

Her order bump was a recipe eBook for $17, and she promoted her main 1:1 coaching at the end.

Within a few weeks, she’d sold over 150 webinar seats, with about 40% taking the order bump.

And she didn’t go live once.

A marketing agency owner did the same thing.

He uploaded a pre-recorded training on *“How to Get 100 Leads a Month with Facebook Ads”*, priced at $7.

His bump was ad copy templates for $27, and on the thank-you page, he plugged his $997 ad management service.

The funnel paid for his ad spend within days  -  and every new customer was a qualified lead, not some random freebie hunter.

# The Engagement Layer

The next thing I added was engagement tools.

I wanted to keep the experience interactive  -  even though it was on-demand.

So I added a simple **chat box** where people could ask questions. 

If the AI couldn’t answer, it sent me an email.

That one feature alone doubled my replies.

It turned a static video into an active conversation.

Then I started using **polls**.

Little questions like:

“Are you currently running ads?”

“Would you like help setting up your next campaign?”

It made people feel involved, and it gave me insight into what they actually needed next.

Finally, I added **hello bars**  \-  those small banners that appear above the video, gently nudging people toward the next step.

Like “Want us to build this for you? Click here to book a call.”

No shouting. 

No pop-ups. 

Just quiet persuasion.

# Running Ads to It

Running Facebook ads to this funnel was a dream compared to traditional webinar funnels.

There was no waiting for “next Thursday’s event.”

No time zone headaches.

No constant reminder emails.

People clicked the ad, bought instantly, and started watching.

Which means the time-to-conversion dropped from *weeks* to *minutes.*

And because they paid a small amount upfront, the ad costs were mostly covered before I even pitched my main offer.

It’s the first time I’d ever had ads that basically paid for themselves.

# Evergreen, Profitable, and Stress-Free

Once you’ve set it up, it just runs.

It’s evergreen.

It’s profitable.

And it’s honest.

You’re not pretending it’s live. 

You’re not faking engagement.

You’re just selling knowledge that helps people  -  and letting your expertise do the heavy lifting.

That’s when I realised… this wasn’t just a better funnel.

It was a better *business model.*

# Building Your Evergreen Webinar Funnel Step-by-Step

Alright, so by now you know why on-demand webinars work, and how much easier they are than live ones.

Now let’s talk about actually building one that converts  -  from the first second someone clicks your link to when they’re buying your main offer and maybe even a few extras.

I like to think of it like setting up a little automated sales machine. 

Once it’s done, it mostly runs itself, leaving you to focus on new ideas, content, or just, you know, not stressing over deadlines.

# Step 1: Choose and Record Your Webinar

First things first  -  you need a webinar.

And ideally, you already have one that’s proven to get attention. 

But even if you’re starting fresh, just remember: the goal isn’t to teach everything under the sun. 

It’s to solve a specific problem your audience has and show them the path forward.

A few tips I learned the hard way:

* **Keep it 60–90 minutes**  \-  long enough to teach something real, but not so long that people zone out.  
* **Focus on clarity**  \-  pre-recording means you can slow down, redo a bit if it flops, and cut the filler. Mess up a line? Pause, redo it, and edit. Live webinars don’t give you that luxury.  
* **Show, don’t just tell**  \-  screen shares, live examples, templates, or step-by-step walkthroughs work way better than talking about theory.  
* **Evergreen-friendly language**  \-  avoid “next Thursday” or “this week.” Instead, use “when you’re ready” or “anytime you watch this.” This keeps the webinar relevant no matter when someone buys.  

Once it’s recorded, get it hosted somewhere reliable. Vimeo, YouTube unlisted, or any solid video hosting service works fine. 

The key is a smooth playback experience  -  nothing worse than a laggy webinar killing your conversions.

# Step 2: Pricing Strategy

You don’t need to charge hundreds to get results.

The sweet spot is **low-cost, high-value**. 

For most niches, $3–$7 is perfect. 

It’s low enough that people don’t hesitate but high enough that they take it seriously.

Think of it this way: anyone paying even a small fee is already a customer. 

They’re more likely to engage, watch the webinar, and follow your next steps. 

Compare that to free webinars  -  most people sign up, skim, and ghost.

If you price it right and deliver value, that tiny payment covers part of your ad spend and filters out freebie seekers. 

Suddenly, your ad budget goes further, and your ROI starts looking really nice.

# Step 3: Create Digital Products

Once the webinar is done, it’s time to think about the **order bump**. 

This is where the magic really starts.

An order bump is a small, complementary offer presented at checkout. I

t’s usually something cheap, valuable, and directly tied to the webinar content.

A few examples I’ve used:

* PDF guides or workbooks  -  “The 30-Day Fat Loss Blueprint” summary, step-by-step plan, checklists  
* Templates or swipe files  -  ad copy bundles, email scripts, content calendars  
* Mini-courses or extra tutorials  -  15–30 minutes of advanced strategies  
* Toolkits  -  spreadsheets, tracking sheets, or small apps  

The beauty of an order bump is that it’s **almost effortless money**. 

You’re offering something the customer already wants. 

Most people take it  -  anywhere from 30–50% conversion is normal  -  which instantly increases your average order value.

# Step 4: Set Up the Watch Page

Once they’ve purchased, they need a place to watch the webinar. 

This is the hub.

Think Amazon’s “You May Also Like” section  -  it works for digital products too. 

Below your video, showcase related items:

* Other webinars  
* Templates, PDFs, and eBooks  
* Advanced courses or services  

This naturally encourages more purchases without feeling pushy.

Next, add **engagement tools**:

* **Chat box**  \-  allows viewers to ask questions. Even if it’s partially automated, it captures leads and lets you follow up personally.  
* **Polls**  \-  find out where your audience is struggling or what they’re interested in. Helps you tailor future products.  
* **Hello bars**  \-  subtle banners nudging people toward your main offer or related products.  

This is the key difference between a static video and a full-fledged funnel. 

You’re turning one recorded webinar into multiple revenue streams.

# Step 5: Run Ads and Drive Traffic

This is where most people fail with live webinars.

Live sessions mean scheduling headaches, ad timing stress, and huge uncertainty. 

People sign up, forget, or miss the session, and suddenly your $50–$100 per registration ad spend is gone.

With evergreen webinars, all that disappears. 

You can run Facebook or Google ads directly to your sales page. 

People buy instantly, watch immediately, and the conversion cycle happens right away.

No waiting. 

No rescheduling. 

No wasted ad spend.

Because even small payments filter out casual viewers, your customer acquisition cost drops dramatically compared to traditional webinar funnels.

# Step 6: Scaling Your System

Once one webinar is working, you can replicate it:

* Record more webinars on related topics  
* Bundle multiple webinars for higher ticket offers  
* Cross-promote within your watch pages  
* Expand order bumps and digital add-ons  

The system grows like compounding interest  -  each new webinar attracts new buyers, upsells increase revenue, and the back-end services or courses become easier to sell because people already trust you.

The more value you provide upfront, the easier it is to sell bigger, higher-ticket products down the line.

# Step 7: Tracking and Refinement

Even though it’s automated, you should keep an eye on:

* Conversion rates on the sales page  
* Take rates for order bumps  
* Engagement on the watch page  
* Ad ROI  

This helps you tweak pricing, update content, and improve offers over time.

One small change  -  a clearer CTA, a slightly better PDF, or an added poll  -  can boost your AOV or main offer conversion dramatically.

# Step 8: Repeat and Automate

The final step is the easiest: rinse and repeat.

Once you’ve recorded a high-quality webinar, set up your order bump, watch page, and ad campaigns, it runs automatically.

From there, you can focus on:

* Making new webinars  
* Expanding your digital product library  
* Optimising ads  
* Creating high-ticket services that naturally upsell from your evergreen content  

At this point, your knowledge is working for you 24/7.

In short, this system fixes almost every problem traditional webinars give you:

* No live scheduling headaches  
* Lower ad spend per paying customer  
* Instant conversions  
* Engaged audience instead of freebie seekers  
* Better content quality, since you can take your time recording  
* Natural upsells through order bumps and watch page cross-promotions  

You don’t need to be a tech genius or spend months building complicated funnels. 

Start small, focus on value, and let the automation do the heavy lifting.

# Optimising, Scaling, and Turning

So, now that you’ve got your first evergreen webinar funnel running, it’s time to level up. 

You’ve seen how much easier this is compared to live webinars, and how even a small upfront payment filters in real buyers. 

But the real magic comes when you start optimising, adding engagement, and scaling your system to make this a reliable, full-time business.

# Optimisation: Making Every View Count

Even with a killer webinar, there’s always room to improve. 

Small tweaks can massively boost conversions and revenue.

1. **Sales Page Tweaks -** Your sales page is where the first decisions are made. Keep it clean and simple, but test different headlines, teasers, or testimonials. A slightly clearer promise can increase your conversion rates by 20–30%.  
2. **Video Quality -** Remember, pre-recorded webinars let you polish every scene. Smooth transitions, clear audio, and clean visuals make people take you seriously. If viewers feel the content is professional, they’re more likely to buy your main offer.  
3. **Engagement Tools -** Polls, chat boxes, and hello bars aren’t just fluff. They give you insight into your audience and guide them toward the next logical purchase. If a poll shows most viewers struggle with a certain step, you can offer a PDF or mini-course as the solution  -  right there on the watch page.  
4. **Order Bump Testing -** Try different types of order bumps  -  PDF guides, templates, mini-courses  -  and monitor which ones convert the best. 30–50% take rates are normal if it’s something the customer actually wants.  
5. **Cross-Sell Placement -** Just like Amazon, showing related products under “You May Be Interested In” can dramatically increase AOV. The key is relevance  -  anything shown should directly tie into what they just learned.

# Advanced Engagement Strategies

Engagement isn’t just about keeping viewers entertained; it’s about moving them down the funnel naturally.

* **AI Chat Assistance or FAQ Chat -** Answer questions automatically or capture emails to follow up. People asking questions are hot leads  -  don’t let them slip away.  
* **Interactive Polls -** Polls do more than entertain. They give you insights into your audience’s level of experience, pain points, and readiness to buy. Use the results to refine your offers.  
* **Hello Bars and Subtle CTAs -** You don’t have to hard-sell. Small banners saying “Need help implementing this? Click here” work better than loud pop-ups. It’s the gentle nudge that turns interest into a purchase.  
* **Content Sequencing -** If you have multiple webinars, link them together. “If you found this useful, check out this next advanced session.” Sequencing encourages buyers to spend more and engage deeper with your content.  

# Pricing Tweaks

Low-cost entry webinars ($3–$7) are perfect for attracting committed viewers. But there’s room to experiment:

* **Step-Up Offers -** Offer slightly higher-priced bundles. Example: “Access this webinar plus the full workbook and templates for $17.”  
* **Time-Limited Bonuses -** Instead of fake live urgency, give real bonuses: “This checklist offer expires in 48 hours.” People respond to clear value deadlines.  
* **Tiered Upsells -** Once they’ve purchased the base webinar, offer mini-courses, 1:1 calls, or full coaching packages. Because they already trust you, higher-ticket offers convert much better.

# Scaling with Multiple Webinars

One webinar is great, but multiple webinars turn this into a full-time, evergreen business.

1. **Record Related Topics -** Once you have one proven webinar, look for complementary topics your audience will pay for. For example: if your first is “SEO Basics,” follow-up webinars could be “Advanced Link Building” or “Google Ads for Beginners.”  
2. **Bundle Offers -** People love deals. “Buy 2 webinars, get 1 free” or “Complete marketing mastery bundle” increases AOV and gives you more revenue per customer.  
3. **Cross-Promotion Between Funnels -** If you have multiple evergreen webinars, promote them across watch pages. This keeps your audience engaged and spending more without extra ad spend.  
4. **Automated Email Follow-Ups -** Even after they watch, send value-packed emails with additional offers. Since they already bought the first webinar, these emails land with a warm, interested audience.  

# Why This System Beats Traditional Methods

I can’t stress this enough: once you’ve got the system dialled in, it crushes the old ways of selling online.

* **Cheaper Customer Acquisition -** Paid ads to a low-cost webinar are far cheaper than cold outreach, live webinars, or expensive email campaigns. Even a few pounds per attendee gives you instant revenue.  
* **Shorter Time to Conversion -** Forget waiting weeks or months for freebie leads to maybe convert. Paid webinars attract buyers who act immediately.  
* **Lower Setup and Running Costs -** Record once, host, and sell. No need for repeated live sessions, reminder emails, or last-minute tech fixes.  
* **High Engagement -** Viewers are invested because they’ve paid something. They watch, take notes, and are primed for the next step  -  unlike freebie hunters who skim and disappear.  
* **Quality Control -** You can redo sections, cut mistakes, and polish your delivery. Better presentation equals higher trust, which equals better conversions.  

# Turning It Into a Full-Time Business

Here’s the beauty of the evergreen model: with a few high-quality webinars and a consistent funnel, you can start generating a predictable income.

* **Repeatable Revenue -** Every new webinar is another income stream. You’re not starting from zero each time.  
* **Upsell & Cross-Sell Ecosystem -** Add PDFs, templates, mini-courses, and services as natural next steps. One webinar becomes multiple revenue opportunities.  
* **Evergreen Traffic -** Run ads, let your organic audience discover the webinars, or promote via email. Once the system is set up, your content keeps selling even if you step away for a few days.  
* **Authority & Trust -** Every webinar builds your reputation. People start seeing you as the go-to expert, which makes selling higher-ticket services or coaching much easier down the line.  

Evergreen webinars aren’t just a workaround for the headaches of live webinars  -  they’re a smarter, faster, and cheaper way to sell online.

You get:

* Real paying viewers, not freebie seekers  
* Shorter time to conversion  
* Lower ad costs per customer  
* Higher engagement and trust  
* Opportunities for order bumps, cross-sells, and upsells  
* A polished, professional product you can refine endlessly  

Do it right, and one well-made webinar can generate revenue, warm leads, and build authority for months or even years without you lifting a finger.

I’ve seen it work across fitness, marketing, coaching, photography, software, and e-commerce. 

Any niche that has a problem to solve can benefit from an evergreen webinar system.

All it takes is one solid webinar, some thoughtful digital products, and a bit of attention to optimising your funnel.

I'm not against romantic encounter but I hate it when people directly ask for pics or sex. I hope there could be genuine connection and exchanges of feelings and ideas.

Because same. And the Internet is flooded with bad advice—""wake up at 5am"", ""ice bath your way to success"", ""gut-heal your zest back""—especially from wannabe wellness influencers spinning what they think sounds science-y. Most of it’s shallow. Most of it ignores the real issue.

After diving deep into research from high-performance psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral science (podcasts, peer-reviewed studies, and way too many books), I realized something: the biggest energy leak isn’t overworking or scrolling or bad sleep. It’s *unprocessed emotional friction*. The mental noise you’re not even aware of. The conversations you never had. The silent battles. The micro-anxieties. The stuff you carry *in your head* every day without realizing it.

Here’s the good news: once you name it, you can start to fix it. This post is a breakdown of what I’ve learned from experts who actually study this for a living: helpful practices, insanely smart books, and apps that go *way beyond* “just journal it out”.

Let’s get into it.

---

**Mental un-closure is draining your brain**

- *Dr. Ethan Kross*, author of **“Chatter”**, found our internal dialogue can use up the same cognitive bandwidth as actual tasks. If you're ruminating on an awkward convo from last week, it's like running multiple browser tabs in your brain.
- According to a 2023 Harvard Business Review article on decision fatigue, even *unresolved micro-decisions* cost energy—like whether to respond to that passive-aggressive Slack, or how to phrase that email.
- *Dr. Gloria Mark* at UC Irvine tracked cognitive energy and found ""attention residue""—the lingering effect of unfinished tasks or emotional threads kills focus WAY more than phone distractions do.

So, the biggest cognitive drain? Not your screen. It’s your *inner noise*. Unfinished emotional business. Low-grade stress with no obvious source.

**How to plug the leak:**

- **Name the friction**  
  - Ask yourself daily: “What am I unconsciously tolerating?”  
  - Is it a fake friend group? A job that feels misaligned? Someone you lowkey resent?  
  - Label it. Write it down. You can’t deactivate a landmine you never locate.

- **Do a daily “mental hygiene” sweep**  
  - Like brushing your teeth, clean up your mind before bed—list out your open mental tabs: worries, half-decisions, emotional leftovers.  
  - Try the *brain dump* method: one page max, stream of consciousness. Don’t analyze. Just evacuate.

- **Strategic rewiring with tiny closure behaviors**  
  - Don’t ghost emotions. Close loops. Send the text. Block the person. Answer the lingering email. Say “no”. Even one small loop-clearing win a day frees up energy.

---

Here are a few mind-shifting, tool-packed resources to help you stop leaking energy like a sieve.

- **Book recommendation you NEED to read:**  
  - *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest  
    - This is hands-down the best self-sabotage book I’ve ever read. USA Today bestseller. It’s all about how unresolved emotional patterns become invisible blocks to your growth. Wiest writes with surgical honesty and poetic fire. Every chapter hit like a mini therapy session.  
    - You'll finally *get* why you're exhausted despite doing all the “right” things.  
    - If you’ve ever felt like your brain is a battlefield of micro-doubts, *this book will make you question everything you think you know about your internal resistance*.  

- **One epic podcast episode that will wreck your excuses:**  
  - *The Diary of a CEO* — Episode with Dr. Julie Smith (author of *Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?*)  
    - She breaks down how your brain misuses energy trying to *avoid* emotions.  
    - Her phrase “emotional procrastination” hit hard.  
    - You’ll walk away understanding the core difference between discomfort and danger, and how facing small discomforts is the hidden key to energy renewal.

- **YouTube deep dive:**  
  - *Andrew Huberman’s episode on Mental Energy Regulation* (Huberman Lab Podcast, Ep 114)  
    - Neuroscientist from Stanford. Not just hype. Actual brain science on why unresolved stress corrupts your focus and inner battery.  
    - He explains how your prefrontal cortex gets “jammed” by persistent low-grade emotional noise.  
    - Nerdy but addictive. The comments alone are worth it.

- **App that turns brain gains into a habit:**  
  - *BeFreed*  
    - Built by a team from Columbia University. It’s part podcast, part personalized study plan. You plug in your mental goals (like “more focus” or “end overthinking”) and it builds a learning map from legit books, neuroscience research, and expert talks.  
    - What makes it elite: you choose how deep you wanna go (10, 20, or 40-minute sessions) *and* even pick your host’s voice—from deep sexy narrator to an e-girl vibe or even a Samantha-from-Her smoky tone (no joke).  
    - What got me hooked? It adapts. The more you listen, the more the app figures out your learning style and builds a personalized knowledge roadmap. Helps you turn deep insights into daily micro-habits.  
    - Great for commuting, walks, or brain snacks between meetings. Perfect if you’re tired of shallow TikTok advice and want something rooted in research.  

- **For emotional tracking + self mapping:**  
  - *Finch*  
    - A self-care app disguised as a cute pet game. But lowkey, it’s genius for habit tracking and emotional check-ins.  
    - You build habits, log moods, and get bite-sized prompts to help you process stuff you didn’t even realize you were holding.  
    - Surprisingly deep. Doesn’t feel like a chore. Helps rewire your default mental loops over time.

- **Another app if emotional chaos is louder than your to-do list:**  
  - *Ash*  
    - Minimalist, therapy-aligned app. Designed for micro-journaling and reflection.  
    - Great for when your head’s too noisy but you can’t afford (or don’t want) traditional therapy.  
    - It guides your entries based on what emotion you click, then nudges you to dig under the surface.

- **Bonus book for next-level detangling:**  
  - *The Untethered Soul* by Michael A. Singer  
    - This isn’t a new release, but it’s a forever classic. #1 NYT bestseller.  
    - Best book on detachment from intrusive thoughts and internal tension.  
    - It will completely shift how you relate to your mental chatter.  
    - You’ll feel 10 pounds lighter after every chapter.

You don’t need to overhaul your life. You just need to stop letting open loops and emotional clutter sabotage your bandwidth. Make space. Clean friction. Process fast. Energy isn’t just sleep, coffee, or macros. It’s everything you choose *not* to carry anymore.

I don't chew gum, especially not in the morning since I'm a coffee drinker. So I knew this wasn't mine. My tote has my name on it and there usually aren't very many people in for Recovery. 
So I reported this to my Manager on duty. According to her, there is only one other person besides her who chew gum, so she called this person up for the service desk and asked him if this was his. He initially denied it. 
Then later on in the day as I'm down stocking bags of dog food, he walks past me to do propane, and he says to me out of nowhere, ""You really got fired up over a piece of gum."" So I said, ""Yeah, you would be too if you found something that disgusting in your tote. We're adults. I wouldn't do that to anyone else. I expect the same courtesy."" Then he walked out the door. 

Was I over reacting by calling up our Manager on duty? This along with some other bullshit that went down really had me in a bad mood today. 
The boss came in so we all had to go through our isles again after finishing recovery and sweep another neath the shelves. No problem. Then out of nowhere, I find piss all over the floor in my section where I just swept. Some stupid mother fucker let their dog piss everywhere and didn't bother to clean it up.

1p5t5yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1p5t5yw/which_teeth_whitening_kit_for_quick_results/,Which teeth whitening kit for quick results?,"Looking for a teeth whitening kit that actually works fast? You're not alone. Yellow or stained teeth can really mess with your confidence, and waiting weeks to see results isn't ideal.

The good news is that some teeth whitening kits can give you visible results in just a few days. But with so many options out there, it's tough to know which one to pick.

## What Makes a Teeth Whitening Kit Work Fast?

The secret is in the ingredients and how they're delivered. Most effective whitening kits use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These ingredients break down stains on your tooth enamel. Higher concentrations work faster, but they need to be safe for home use.

LED light technology also speeds things up. When combined with whitening gel, the light activates the ingredients and helps them work more efficiently. This means you can see results in less time compared to strips or toothpaste alone.

## What to Look For

When choosing a professional teeth whitening kit, pay attention to these features:

- **Gel strength** - Look for products with 10-35% carbamide peroxide or 3-10% hydrogen peroxide
- **LED light included** - This accelerates the whitening process
- **Treatment time** - The best kits work in 10-30 minutes per session
- **Dental-grade quality** - Professional-level kits deliver better results than drugstore options

You also want something that won't cause crazy tooth sensitivity. Kits with desensitizing gel or gentler formulas help prevent that uncomfortable zing feeling.

## A Solid Option Worth Checking Out

If you want quick results without overpaying, [check out this teeth whitening kit](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) that combines LED light therapy with professional-strength gel. It's designed for home use and delivers results you can actually see within the first few applications.

The kit typically includes multiple gel syringes, an LED mouthpiece, and everything you need to get started right away. Most people notice their teeth looking 2-3 shades lighter after just a few sessions.

## How to Get the Best Results

Even with a good whitening system, you need to use it correctly. Follow the instructions exactly - more gel or longer sessions won't speed things up and might hurt your teeth.

Avoid coffee, red wine, and dark sodas during your whitening routine. These drinks stain your teeth and slow down your progress. Same goes for smoking.

Brush your teeth before each whitening session, but wait about 30 minutes after brushing to apply the gel. This protects your enamel and reduces sensitivity.

## Bottom Line

You don't need expensive dental office visits to get whiter teeth quickly. A quality at-home whitening kit with LED technology can give you noticeable results in less than a week. The key is choosing one with the right concentration of whitening agents and using it consistently.

I’m having serious trouble with my Sage Barista Pro and I’m hoping for some help.

**Machine:** Sage Barista Pro (integrated grinder)  
**Beans:** 200 Degrees – Brazilian Love Affair (medium roast)  
**Problem:** No matter what I do, the coffee is extremely bitter. Even when I make a latte, I still detect a strong, unpleasant bitterness underneath.

**What I’ve tried:**

* Adjusted both the **internal burr setting** and the **outer grind size**.
* Temperature: set to mid-low.
* I cannot achieve a proper **1:2 brew ratio** at all.

**Example settings & result:**

* Internal burr: 2
* Outer grind size: 11
* Temperature: mid-low → Result: 17 g in → 42 g out in \~20 s When I **lower the grind size number (making the grind finer)** to around 9, the taste becomes even more bitter, and the shot still doesn’t improve. I’ve probably used up nearly 500 g of beans experimenting, and nothing seems to help.

**Additional info:**

* Dose: 17 g
* Yield: 42 g
* Time: \~20 s
* Tried both straight espresso and latte with the same underlying bitterness.

**Request for help:**

*8:34. It’s been 3 minutes since I ordered my coffee. Ludicrous service.* Rohan was perched on a garden chair outside Tonio’s, and had been since 8:29. Josuke and Okuyasu never showed, and neither did Hayato, so he thought a morning trip to Tonio’s Italian was necessary to appease his fury. He had ordered a tri-shot espresso with organic almond milk with a single pump of virgin pistachio juice. *Perfectly reasonable order. Why is it taking so long?*

“Excuse me sir?” a teenager and his friend lingered behind Rohan while he fawned over his nails.

“Yes?” he replied, not looking up from those misshapen nails. *Need to stop biting them.*

“Are you the mangaka of Pink Dark Boy, Kishibe Rohan?”

He sighed. “Yes, that is I, in the flesh. Do you want an autograph or something?”

“Yes please sir.” The child produced a small piece of paper from his notepad and placed it beside Rohan. He spat on the page, a thick, wet dollop of saliva perfectly forming a picture of Kishibe Rohan in all his glory.

“There. Please leave.” He demanded, and the children left, rather bewildered. *Too famous, too handsome. What more could I ask for?*

Tonio himself emerged from his restaurant, bearing Rohan’s sacred tri-shot almond milk pistachio espresso in his fingers. “There, Mr Rohan. Sorry for the wait.”

“Thank you.” He said nonchalantly, still admiring his nails while he drank. *Two more milligrams of pistachio than usual. Ratio of milk to espresso is off by eight percent. An imperfect product, Tonio.* He slurped the coffee in glee nonetheless, as Tonio’s magic kicked in. The Italian himself was a stand user- wielding Pearl Jam, which gave his food almost healing properties, so while Rohan slurped, his ugly little nails transformed, growing smooth and long and pristine. *Lovely.*

“So, Mr Rohan, Mr Hirose mentioned you saw a ghost?”

“Why do you care?”

“I’m a bit of an occult fanatic myself.”

“Sure. We did. The girl Yoshikage Kira murdered.” *Reimi Sugimoto. And her dog.* She told him and Koichi that the killer had come lurking by night, murdered her and pinned her dog to the wall to bleed out. He had cut off her hands, too. *I’m not one to kink shame, but severed hands are a smidge too far.*

“Poor girl was only fourteen when that bastard killed her,” he told Tonio, “but we’re closing in on him now. I can feel it.”

“Good luck to you Mr Rohan.”

“Thank you Tonio. Good fortune to thee, and farewell.” Tonio returned to his restaurant, and Rohan returned to his nails. *Good idea for a one shot manga.*

Just then, his Nokia buzzed on the table, his coffee jittering and spilling. He snatched the phone and placed it to his ear with disgust.

“World-class mangaka Kishibe Rohan speaking?”

“ROHAN! 32ND STREET! HOUSE WITH THE GREEN DOOR! NOW!” It was a distressed Josuke. Rohan wasted no time.

“On my way.” He slapped the phone shut, slid a thousand yen under his teacup, stuffed a cannoli in his pocket and rushed to his red corvette. He slammed on the acceleration and dialed Koichi’s number simultaneously.

“Koichi!”

He picked up after a few seconds, his squeaky voice sounding like a chipmunk on the phone. “What’s up Rohan?”

“Call Jotaro’s landline now! Josuke’s found Kira!”

“Holy shit!” Koichi yelled. Rohan heard the scrambling of feet, the turning of keys and the sliding of coins as Kochi presumably used the landline. After about 20 seconds, Rohan heard Koichi slam the phone against the handle. “He’s not picking up!”

“Go to him, then!”

“I’m at school! And the Grand Morioh Hotel is a mile away!”

“You can’t drive?”

“I’m fifteen Rohan! What did you expect?”

“Laws don’t apply right now. Get in your mother’s Fiat and get to Jotaro now. Be at 32nd street as soon as you can.” And he flipped the phone shut.

By 8:45, Rohan parked beside the house Josuke told him, bespoke green door open with a blood trail carrying across the street. He saw a huge hole in the wall beside the house across the street, bricks blackened with smoke sizzling off them like cooking eggs. *Josuke can’t explode stuff, from what I know. That must be Mr Kira.*

Rohan sprinted into the house, following the bloodtrail into the living room, Okuyasu lying limping on the floor while Josuke weeped.  
“Rohan! He won’t wake up!” Rohan saw that whatever injury Josuke had healed, the damage was already done. Okuyasu’s blank expression had gotten ever blanker.

Rohan unleashed Heaven’s Door, Okuyasu’s face morphing into that of an Okuyasu-shaped book. Rohan began flipping the pages, random words dotted in no particular order, watching as they slowly faded into the page.

“Damnit! We’re losing him! What’s up with your stand?”

“I don’t know?! It healed the wound, but he won’t get up!” Josuke wiped tears from his eyes and shook his friend, but to no avail. *Sometimes I forget he’s just a kid.* At first, Rohan awkwardly patted Josuke on the shoulder, but the kid slammed into his chest, a little bewildering to the mangaka. But nonetheless, he comforted his friend. “It’s ok, kid. We’ll be out of here soon.” Rohan placed the cannoli in his hand. “Jotaro’s on his way. He’ll kill this sonofabitch.”

“No.” Josuke sniffled, and scowled. “I will.”

A huge explosion erupted from the street, and Rohan bucked his head through the window. His baby, his girl, his corvette, was a smoking ruin. *I might have to beat you to that, kid.* 

“What’s this guy’s Stand, Josuke? I’d like to steal this for my manga.”

“It can turn anything it touches into a bomb, and it's pretty fast. Oh, and if we don’t kill him by 9:24, he turns back time and we all die.”

*Bleak.* “Is he stronger than Heaven’s Door?”

“He’s stronger than me, Rohan. Don’t go.”

“Lay a hand on my corvette, lose the hand.” And Rohan took to the streets, as Josuke seized his phone and dialed Koichi’s number.

Rain had befallen Morioh, and Yoshikage Kira stood in the middle of the street, white suit covered in blood. Beside him, lay a bloodied corpse of a small boy, unmoving, unflinching. *The fucker murders children, too?* Rohan’s nose coiled- he had joined the investigation for curiosity’s sake, but things had gotten serious. *I gotta take this guy down.*

“Sorry, I couldn't resist.” Kira referenced the smoldering ruin of the corvette. Mr Rohan. What a pleasure to finally meet. In this timeline, of course.”

“I wish I could say the same, but I can’t. That dreamy corvette was gifted to me by Eiichiro Oda himself. And that child you just murdered had dreams just like mine that he will now never achieve.” Rohan walked through the dampened ashes of his car, and locked eyes with the killer, about five feet away from him. “He was an annoying brat. I spared his life of the misery it would feel.”

Rohan’s Heaven’s Door sprung into action, attempting to incapacitate Kira, but his Killer Queen blocked it. Rohan, using his decade of training in kung-fu, slid on the wet floor and struck Kira in the belly with his heel, and kicked him to the ground. Kira slipped along the road and rolled to the sidewalk, clutching his side.

“I don’t even need my stand to beat you, scum.”

“Check your pockets.”

Rohan obliged, and looked down at his drawing pocket lined with pens and pencils ready for any emergency drawing or writing. But amidst the fountains and ballpoints and leads, was a yellowish HB, one he didn’t recognize, one with a sticker labelled ‘Hayato Kawajiri’ on its butt. *Shit.*

In about half a second, Rohan was flung back beside the wreckage, clutching what remained of his leg. All the flesh and skin from hip to knee was gone, bone partially protected by loose flakes of blood. The pain was nothing he had experienced. *Josuke. Get here. Please.*

“Quite a dramatic entrance for a newly cripple”

Rohan coughed up some blood, and gargled on his words.

“You know, I’ve done this loop about five times now. And each time you die, it pleases me more and more.”

“Fuck. You.” He managed to spit out.

“No, Mr Rohan. Fuck, you.” He raised his hand, clutching a pebble he had turned into a bomb, ready to release and finish the job.

“YOSHIKAGE KIRA!” Rohan heard Josuke’s voice, but couldn’t turn his head to see where. “FIGHT ME NOW, COWARD!” *Fool. He’ll die before I do.*

“As you wish.” Kira raised his hands, and flicked the pebble at Rohan. Josuke jumped in front, activating Crazy Diamond on the pebble causing it to return to the ground. Rohan could feel his skin and bone growing back with Crazy Diamond’s aid.

“Nice trick. I see that it doesn’t work on yourself, though.” Kira mentioned Josuke’s still bleeding leg.

“No matter. I don’t need legs to kill you. Just fists.” Kira was subsequently catapulted into what appeared to be into the sun, as Rohan watched in joy.

Kira landed beside two walls, about twenty feet away from Rohan. He began hopping over, while Josuke slammed his Crazy Diamond into the ground, catapulting himself there too. Rohan perched beside a tree while Kira and Josuke stared each other down.

Before Josuke could charge, however, a set of bubbles began floating overhead, blown by a gaggle of giggling children behind the walls Kira was wedged between. Everyone knew what was happening before it happened. *Those dainty bubbles are bombs.*

Josuke stood defiant, while Kira laughed. “You fool! You can’t muster the courage to come here and beat me to death because of some bubbles?”

“Don’t listen to him Josuke! He’s trying to provoke you!” But Rohan’s words fell on deaf ears.

“But, what more could I expect from a bastard half-breed uncle of Jotaro Kujo! I heard that American father of yours was already his grandaddy when he abandoned you and your whore mother!”

“Shut it, Kira!” Rohan yelled while Josuke seethed. *That kid’s temper. Don’t be stupid.*

“Did you get that shitty hairdo from your sister-fucking white devil of a father, too?”

*Shit.*

Josuke charged like a bull against a matador, raising his arms across his chest while he rushed through the bubbles. But he wasn't stupid like a bull- Rohan knew it- Josuke was a clever rascal.

As he charged, the bubbles popped, but before they would blow him to smithereens, Rohan saw Crazy Diamond heal the bubble and return it over the wall. Not a single bubble pierced Josuke. *Now, kill that fucker.*

“DON’T!” Josuke threw a punch.

“SAY!” A kick.

“ANYTHING!” Another punch.  
“ABOUT!” A headbutt.

“MY!” Another kick.

“HAIR!” Kira’s jaw slackened as Josuke threw his final punch. 

Rohan’s leg had healed. “Is he dead yet?”

“Nope. Not yet. Lemme catch my breath, then I’ll be done with him.” Kira looked up, eyes fixated on Josuke.

“This, is for Hayato.” He raised his fist, just as another bubble flew over the wall.

“JOSUKE! YOUR RIGHT!"" But Rohan was too late. The bubble popped on Josuke’s elbow, and he flew backwards, flying back beside the corvette. His arm was reduced to a bloody stump all the way to his elbow, his other hand cupping it like a babe, while his mouth trickled blood.

Kira rose, and grabbed his dislocated jaw. “Valiant,” He snapped it in place with a crack. “But you never stood a chance.”

Rohan lunged forward, but Killer Queen batted him away into the road. Rohan tasted blood in his mouth once more, and lay hopeless while Kira kicked him over and over. Beaten and bloody, he rolled over beside Josuke, and let him lean on his shoulder. He checked the time. 9:08. *In less than twenty minutes he’s dispatched us. And in another twenty, we’ll all be dead.*

Kira wandered over, slyly kicked Hayato’s corpse, and crouched down about five feet away from them. “That was it? Really?  Jotaro better be something, cause this was a little embarrassing.”

“He’ll be here, any minute.”

“Really? But what does it matter if he arrives when I’ve made you corpses?”

Josuke coughed some more blood, and Rohan cupped his hand over his mouth. Through splutters and groans, he moaned, “He’s faced worse than you. He’s faced Dio.” *Dio?* Rohan was unfamiliar with this name

“Dio was a fool. He hired Okuyasu’s father, for goodness sake. I must assume the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”

“TASTE THESE APPLES BITCH!” Okuyasu lunged over the car, the Hand primed and ready, swinging down his fist over an unsuspecting Kira. He managed to slink out of the way, but the Hand still struck his ear, voiding it from lobe to helix. Kira grunted angrily, pulled him down, kneed him in the stomach and threw his feline tie over Okuyasu’s shoulder, bombing it immediately. He slumped down beside Rohan, clutching his bloody wound. Rohan could smell the cannoli on his breath. *Thank you Tonio. I will be leaving a substantial tip next time.*

Kira’s eyes twitched while he clutched the remnants of his ear. His teeth gritted, and fists balled. *You’ve certainly pissed him off, Okuyasu.*

“Can I have a little peace for a moment?!” Kira spoke sternly like a disappointed father, barely holding his calm facade together.

“Peace? You want peace? I fear you’ve chosen the wrong career.” Rohan spoke, short of breath. He was more concerned with Josuke than that raving fool, the boy’s eyes fluttering open and shut every few seconds while he groaned and moaned, clasping his arm tight as a bowstring.

Kira kicked Rohan’s head, his skull cracking on the aluminum car. Rohan tried to turn his head, but it was locked into place. He saw Josuke lean on Okuyasu’s remaining shoulder, eyes shut. *Jotaro! Where are you?!*

“I didn’t even need Bites the Dust to defeat you fools.” Kira remarked. “All I had to rely on was your own stupidity. Your emotions. You act with your hearts, not your heads. That was your fatal flaw.”

“You’re right.” Josuke spoke clearly to Rohan’s surprise. “We are humans. We view the world through our emotions. You,” he coughed some blood, “are a predator.”

“How clairvoyant, Higashikata. I am a predator. And you are scarcely even prey.”

“You think that's your advantage?” Rohan spoke. “You’re forgetting a rather important factor about prey.”

“What’s that?”

“There are always more prey than predators.”

A tiny green Fiat had launched into Kira at full speed, as his fragile body cracked and crumbled down the road. Through blurred vision, Rohan could see little Koichi Hirose emerge from the driver’s seat, holding his head, before he fell to the ground. And coming out the back door, appeared a giant- six feet of muscle wrapped in a white trench coat, a swanky cap phasing into a head of jet-black hair, fists clenched in a cool, calm, seething rage.

*Oh Kira, you’re royally fucked now.* Jotaro Kujo had arrived. ",3,1764018324.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Got a few quotes, this one was easily the cheapest and the guy had decent reviews, so we went with him. He originally said 2 days, but three lads turned up and got it done in one, which was a bonus.
I was at work all day. 
My wife was working from home and let them in. She made them a coffee when they arrived, no problem. Because they were doing plumbing work there was no usable toilet all day, plus it was noisy, so after a couple of hours she popped to her sister’s round the corner to get some work done and came back late afternoon.
When she got home the place was a bit of a state:

•  No dust sheets or anything down, just boot prints on the wooden floor

•  Tools, offcuts and packaging left about

•  Kitchen cupboards had been opened and tea/coffee things moved around, fingerprints everywhere.

•  They’d clearly helped themselves to a couple more drinks while she was out

•  When they finished they just packed up and left, didn’t sweep up or even over to tidy up after themselves.

I got home that evening and ended up spending an hour tidying and hoovering. Still found a couple of bits of pipe the next day.
We’re not precious about the house or anything, but it just felt a bit cheeky – especially them rummaging in the cupboards without asking and leaving us to clean up. Is this pretty standard for boiler installs these days or were they just taking the mick a bit? First time we’ve had one done so genuinely not sure.

Is AI the Key to Perfect Control or a Pathway to Lost Faith?
============================================================

The Age of Artificial Intelligence: An Introduction
---------------------------------------------------

In a world increasingly dominated by technology, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Will artificial intelligence become our perfect ally, guiding us toward greater efficiency and control, or could it lead us into a labyrinth of lost faith? This question is not just about technology; it’s deeply rooted in our spiritual journey.

Imagine waking up in a world where every task is streamlined by clever algorithms. Your morning coffee is brewed perfectly every time, your calendar seamlessly organizes your day, and your health is monitored by devices that anticipate your needs. However, amidst the convenience, a nagging question arises—what happens to our faith in God? Are we placing too much trust in our machines instead of relying on the Lord?

The Promise and Pitfalls of AI
------------------------------

### The Promise of Control

AI offers remarkable capabilities:

- **Efficiency**: Automating tasks allows us to focus on what truly matters.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI helps us make informed choices based on vast amounts of data.
- **Enhanced Communication**: AI tools improve how we connect with each other, breaking barriers of distance and time.

Yet, while these advancements seem beneficial, we must ask ourselves: what cost comes with this control?

### The Pitfalls of Overreliance

On the other hand, excessive reliance on AI can lead to:

- **Loss of Intuition**: Relying solely on algorithms may stifle our ability to think critically.
- **A Shallow Relationship with God**: If we depend more on technology for answers, our conversations with Him may dwindle.
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: AI can perpetuate biases, raising questions about morality and justice.

Indeed, Proverbs 3:5-6 gives profound wisdom: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight.”

Reflecting on Our Relationship with Technology
----------------------------------------------

### Questions for Reflection

1. **What role does technology play in your daily spirituality?**
2. **Do you find yourself dependent on AI for decisions you once prayed about?**
3. **How can you ensure that your faith stays strong amidst the rise of technology?**

### Navigating the Balance

In navigating our relationship with AI, we must find a balance that honors both our earthly tools and our Heavenly Father. Consider practical steps:

- **Abide in Prayer**: Commit your tech use to prayer. Ask God for discernment in how to engage with these tools.
- **Set Boundaries**: Establish tech-free time, allowing space for silence and prayer.
- **Seek Community**: Engage with fellow believers to discuss your thoughts on modern technology’s role in faith.

Conclusion: Embracing Technology with Faith
-------------------------------------------

As we forge ahead into this tech-infused future, the question remains: Is AI the key to perfect control or merely a pathway to lost faith? While AI offers amazing benefits, it is vital to root our identity and trust in Christ above all else.

### Call to Action

What are your thoughts on this topic? Have you found yourself relying more on technology instead of trusting in God? Share your experiences in the comments below, and let’s explore this journey together!

By staying vigilant and anchored in faith, we can enjoy the advantages of AI while ensuring that our relationship with God remains our top priority. Let’s navigate this exciting yet challenging landscape with both wisdom and grace.

Chapter 1: Dream Hopper part 1

A six–square–meter box was what they called a home. It was built from decaying plywood, old tarpaulins, and sheets of rusted metal. Their father worked as a freelance delivery rider for an app, but today he earned less than nothing. His motorcycle broke down in the middle of his route, and he had to spend what little money they had to get it repaired so he could work again the next day.

Dinner was simple, almost nothing, yet it tasted warm and comforting. Five packs of yellow odong noodles simmered in water with a single can of red sardines. The broth was stretched thin but enough to fill the stomachs of the five children and their parents. The servings were small, but the soup helped silence the hunger.

They slept where they ate and lived where they ate. By nine in the evening, the lone light bulb was switched off, and the nine of them settled under one mosquito net, packed together like sardines. Nigel’s mother fanned her children with a worn plastic fan, lifting and lowering her hand to cool their sticky skin. The heat trapped inside the tiny home refused to leave. It was summer, and the metal ceiling held the sun’s warmth long after sunset.

Nigel lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. Metal clanked whenever the two cats that slept above their roof started fighting. He waited for sleep, watching shadows shift in the faint darkness. His mother’s hand eventually slowed from exhaustion, and when it finally stopped, his little sister gently lifted her mother’s arm and continued fanning. The motion grew weaker and weaker until every sound in the room faded into steady breathing.

Nigel’s eyes grew heavy. The ceiling blurred. At last, his thoughts slipped away and sleep claimed him.

A voice echoed in the light.

“Man, welcome to your dream. I told you I would meet you here.”

Jendai grinned at him.

Nigel stared around in disbelief. His dream had never looked this alive. The land stretched upward into the sky and downward like an endless pillar. The sky itself surrounded everything, thick and shifting like rainbow fog. Ruins floated in the mist. Giant stones, ancient statues, towers made from travertine and tuff drifted weightlessly.

The land was covered with trees and plants that did not exist in the real world. Flowers bloomed with bursts of tiny stars. Fruits cracked open like hatching eggs and turned into plates of food, each one different and filled with things Nigel had only imagined.

Nigel sprinted from one place to another, devouring every food he could get his hands on in the plates under the trees and in the plants, there are plants that burst out fruit juices, chocolate milk, coffee jelly and so much more. Fruits made of meat with gravy that are ice cold to hold but become warm when eaten. The mint fruit gummy worms are silky and sweet, with a cool breeze of mint. when chewed they shrink into miniature gummy cleaners that dance around your mouth, brushing between your teeth and polishing your tongue with a gentle, tingly sweep. By the time they melt away, your whole mouth feels refreshed, smooth, and teeth sparkling.

Jendai was eating too, though nowhere near as wildly as Nigel, who was practically inhaling everything in sight.

Nigel’s stomach filled with goodness and everything nice.

When they finally sat down to rest, they plucked grass from the ground. Each blade released a burst of sparkling water that fizzed across their tongues like cold soda.

Nigel looked at Jendai.

“Jen, seriously. Dream jumping. I am still trying to understand how this is real.”

Jendai let out a long breath.

“Man, I am stuffed. You finished eating? I am going to hop into Tyson’s dream next.”

Nigel leaned closer.

“How does your power even work?”

Jendai shrugged.

“I am not sure. One day it just happened.”

Nigel laughed.

“Weirdo. Go now. Tomorrow I will bring an odong stick to school. You bring bagoong. If we both have it tommorow, we will know this is really happening.”

Jendai nodded.

“Got it. I am leaving now.”

Jendai and Nigel knocked their fists together forming a fistbump, and the moment their knuckles touched, Jendai’s power flared to life. He grinned cause he thought triggering it with a fist bump would look cool. But the instant their skin connected a swirling wormhole snapped into existence inside of Jendai tugging at them with a strange, weightless pull. Jendai vanished first, yanked through like a spark caught in a gust. Nigel felt the same force hook onto him, pulling him after Jendai before he could even gasp.

Instead of being spit out like trash, the wormhole released them softly, more like a teleport’s exhale than a messy expulsion. One blink, and the ground steadied beneath them.

Studying often feels like a journey, right? Every lecture is a level, every assignment is a mini-boss, and exams? Those are the epic boss fights. I wanted a place where we could treat studying like an actual quest - full of strategies, hacks, and shared victories. Not just grind through notes, but level up together.

The “quest” part is important. It reminds us that learning isn’t just a chore. It’s an adventure. Some days you gain experience points, some days you stumble into traps (looking at you, procrastination), but the goal is always progress. And what’s an adventure without companions? That’s where this sub comes in. Here, you can share tips, ask questions, celebrate wins, and maybe even laugh at the fails along the way.

So welcome, fellow adventurers! Grab your pens, your notes, or even a cup of coffee, and let’s tackle this journey together. Every post, every tip, every question adds XP. Let’s make studying an epic quest.

If you like this idea  -  join the journey, share your wisdom, and let’s level up together!",1,1764017738.0,StudyQuest,0,1.0,False

1p5suvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1p5suvt/stop_overthinking_it/,Stop overthinking it,"I’ve recently been trying to strip back how I think of losing weight. Until recently, it felt like this thing I had to master. I had to have the right diet, the right meals, really delicious alternatives to junk food, recipes galore, the best supplements and protein powders… and guess what? I just continued to eat mounds of food but instead of chocolate and takeaways, it was two pots of overnight oats and my delicious “fakeaway” meal prepped lunches. Maybe healthier, but not losing any weight. I have stripped it right back, completely rethought my relationship with food, and here’s where I’m at:

1. Banana and black coffee or tea when hungry. 
2. Don’t eat outside eating windows. Yes, that means not having your “super healthy, high protein snacks”. You’re not going to starve going without food for a few hours. Snacks aren’t essential, unless you’ve been told otherwise specifically for your needs.
3. Walk twice a day. Once in the morning after before eating, once in the evening after eating.
4. Decent dinner. No calorie counting, no avoiding carbs, no carnivore diet or anything like that. Just a nutritious, whole-food dinner. 
5. Exercise as often as possible. Whether it’s yoga or the gym, just something to keep your mind and mouth off food.

That’s it. Eat less, when cravings come have a cup of tea (green or black) or coffee with a disgusting banana to put you right off wanting to eat, and walk  loads. Oh, and also, I don’t care what anyone says about unhealthy body standards… it can’t hurt to look at a picture of Kendall Jenner every once in a while.

This time of year can bring up a lot for people, and having someone solid to talk to really matters. If you’ve been thinking about finding a therapist, Michelle is a great person to look into!

One thing that really stands out about her is the atmosphere she creates. She can handle the hard, messy stuff without any problem, but she also has this warm sense of humor that makes tough conversations feel a lot less scary. There’s usually some laughter mixed in, not because she isn’t taking you seriously, but because she’s good at helping people feel comfortable while talking about real things.

And just putting this out there for anyone in the neurodivergent community. Neurodivergence is one of her main areas of focus, and she approaches it with a lot of understanding and respect.

He worked part time as a dishwasher at a restaurant, and had complained that washing glasses with lipstick on the rim was the thing he hated the most. We knew he worked on Saturday mornings, so the following Saturday we went there for Brunch, and just ordered a bunch of juices, smoothies, coffees, fresh glasses of water, etc. and we would apply a fresh layer of lipstick before drinking in any of them. He must have hated his shift. It was very petty, but my friend was feeling way better after.

1p5splx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1p5splx/what_small_perks_or_events_made_you_love_living/,What small perks or events made you LOVE living in an apartment community?,"Hey everyone!

I’m curious to hear from people who have rented in different types of apartments — budget-friendly, mid-range, or “luxury.”

Not so much about granite countertops or rooftop pools, but the **resident experience** side of things. The little perks, activities, or services that actually made living there feel enjoyable or special.

# What made you think: “Wow, they really thought about us”?

Examples could be:

* Monthly socials (Wine Wednesday, Taco Night, etc.)
* Free fitness classes or yoga on-site
* Dog-focused perks (treat bar, on-site dog walker, pup play dates)
* Holiday decorating or community parties
* Coffee bar in the lobby
* Food trucks on weekends
* Package help / concierge hours
* Workshops or classes (cooking, crafts, wellness)
* Meet-your-neighbors mixers
* Cleaning or laundry drop-off partnerships
* Book clubs, game nights, movie nights
* Local business discounts

Or even super simple things like:

* Staff remembering your name
* A group chat or community board
* Someone to water plants while you’re traveling
* Free guest parking passes
* Flexible reservation spaces

# What actually mattered to you?

* What made you feel more connected or cared for?
* What helped you meet people or feel less isolated?
* What services saved you time or stress?
* What perks made the rent feel more “worth it”?
* What would you LOVE to see more places offer?

And on the flip side:

* What events felt awkward, pointless, or poorly done?
* What perks sounded cool but no one actually used?

I’m hoping to get a wider perspective on what renters genuinely enjoy when it comes to community and lifestyle — not just flashy amenities.

If you could add ONE realistic perk or event to your current apartment community, what would it be?

Would love your thoughts!",3,1764017309.0,Apartmentliving,18,0.67,False

Would appreciate reality checks.","I’m 25 and thinking of moving out of my parents house. I’m in the Greater Vancouver area (BC, Canada) and currently make around $2,600/month sometimes more, but never less. I work my own flexible schedule and also do reasonably well in the stock market. The place I’m looking at is $1,600/month (cheap studio apartment in my area), available Jan 1st on a 1 year lease.

I’m pretty frugal and low-maintenance. This isn’t a forever budget I’m pursuing a Firefighting career and am actively applying to departments around the Lower Mainland (I know it’s competitive). My backup plan is Paramedic, which I already have some training for and they’re always hiring. As a third option, I can go back to working as an electrician since I’m trained, even though I really didn’t like it, but it does pay decently.

I’m prepared to live on this tight budget for up to 2 years, although I’m hoping to land one of those jobs much sooner.

I’d love insight on whether this is a dumb idea, unrealistic, or if I’m overlooking something. I know the income to rent ratio isn’t great.



My financial situation:

$0 debt

838 credit score

$5,000 in chequing as a cushion (I maintain this number while putting surplus in savings/stock market)

$10,000 emergency fund

$85,000 in the stock market (and other assets I could tap if things went really bad, but I’d move back home before touching these)

$15,000 line of credit (unused)



Planned monthly budget:

Rent/Utilities: $1,600

Internet: $60

Phone: $40

Spotify: $13

Gas: $200

Groceries: $300

Renters Insurance: $20

Misc/Savings: $427



I have a reliable car, and I pay insurance in full every April ($2,000). I also do my own basic maintenance.

Over the last 6 months I’ve already picked up a lot of the essentials (plates, bowls, pots, pans, towels, cleaning supplies, etc.). I have about five boxes of stuff ready. The only larger items I still need are a couch, coffee table, and TV stand, which I’ll probably find on Marketplace.

Even though I love my parents and siblings, I really don’t love my current living situation. I feel like I’ve outgrown the household, and not having my own space is starting to affect me mentally. I want independence and a home that’s actually mine.

Given everything does this seem doable, or am I being unrealistic and should just tough it out at home longer?",1,1764017278.0,movingout,0,0.99,False

Morning came slowly, a gray, suffocating kind of light that made everything in the room look faded. I must have dozed for minutes at a time, but it wasn’t sleep. It was more like sinking into shallow water and jolting back to the surface before anything could pull me under. 

When I finally stood, the bandages tugged tight across my arms and ribs, already stained through. I changed into a fresh shirt so my mother wouldn’t see, and for a second I caught my reflection in the mirror—pale, unsteady, like someone visiting a place he’d sworn never to return to. For a moment, the face didn’t even look like mine.

The hall smelled exactly the way it used to in the mornings, that mix of stale coffee and dust and something metallic I never could identify. The house was quiet—too quiet. 

I paused at the end of the hallway, listening the way I used to as a kid before deciding whether it was safe to come out. I hated myself for doing it, but the instinct was too old and too deeply wired to suppress. No footsteps. No voices. Just the low hum of the refrigerator and the soft ticking of the kitchen clock.

She was at the stove when I walked in, stirring something in a pot with her shoulders hunched like she’d been standing like that for a long time. She glanced over her shoulder and smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. 

“Did you sleep at all?” she asked. Her voice was hoarse, and her hands trembled slightly as she pushed her hair back from her face.

“Some,” I lied. My gaze drifted to the kitchen table. A glass sat there that I didn’t remember her using the night before, filled halfway with water that looked too still, like it hadn’t been touched in hours. 

She followed my eyes to it and frowned as if seeing it for the first time. Then she moved it to the sink with a haste that didn’t match her exhaustion.

We ate in a quiet far heavier than anything from dinner. She kept searching my face, studying me like she was waiting for me to confirm a suspicion she hadn’t said aloud yet. 

At one point she reached out and brushed something from my sleeve—a small flake of dried blood I’d missed—and when she saw what it was, her entire expression faltered. 

Her fingers lingered for a moment before she pulled her hand back to her lap, gripping her own knuckles tight enough that her skin went white.

“Do you ever feel strange here?” she asked suddenly. Her voice was too soft, like she was worried the air itself might carry the words somewhere she didn’t want them to go.

I looked at her for a long moment before answering. “What do you mean?”

She stared down at her hands, rubbing her thumb over the faint crescent-shaped scars on her left palm—the ones she got during one of her worst nights, when she’d hit the wall so hard her rings somehow cut into her skin. 

She almost never acknowledged that they existed. 

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “It’s hard to explain. Sometimes this house feels… full. Like there’s more in it than just us. Like it remembers things I don’t want to remember.” 

She hesitated, then added, “You used to be so scared all the time. It felt like that fear lived here even when you weren’t in the room.”

The words hollowed something out inside me, not because they were cruel or accusatory, but because she sounded genuinely confused, like she had spent years trying to make sense of something intangible pressing against her without form or name. 

Before I could respond, the light above the sink flickered twice, slow and deliberate, the way it used to during storms. Except the sky outside the window was clear.

After a moment she said, too lightly, “I was thinking, after I get off work today… maybe we could go get coffee? Or lunch somewhere? That diner by the highway is still open. You used to like it, remember?”

I didn’t answer at first. Something knotted in my gut. That word—remember—felt heavy in the air after what the house had shown me last night.

She seemed to notice my hesitation and rushed on, her words tripping over themselves.

“I just mean—if you want. We don’t have to. I just thought it might be nice. You and me. To talk, or… not talk. Just spend time.”

She twisted her fingers together under the table. A nervous tic I didn’t remember from childhood.

“I’m trying,” she said quietly. “I know that doesn’t fix anything. But I’m trying.”

She looked at me then—really looked—and there was nothing defensive in her expression. Just tiredness. Regret. A hope so small it looked afraid to exist.

I stabbed a piece of egg I didn’t want and forced myself to meet her eyes.

“Yeah,” I said. “Lunch is fine.”

Her face softened in this cautious, trembling way—as if she didn’t want to smile too widely and ruin the moment.

“Good,” she said, barely above a whisper. “Good.”
For a second, it felt… almost normal.

But then she glanced toward the corner of the room, quick and subtle, like checking that something wasn’t listening. The motion was so fast I almost missed it, but not fast enough to pretend it wasn’t there.

I followed her gaze out of instinct.

Nothing was there. Just the empty corner where the paint was peeling.

Still, something in the air felt aware. As if the house was leaning closer.

She stood abruptly, gathering plates even though I was still eating. “I should get dressed,” she said. “Traffic’s bad on weekdays. But—what time should I pick you up? Is around 3 or 4 okay?”

I swallowed my food, throat tight.

“Whenever,” I said.

She nodded. But when she turned away, I caught a flicker—some shadow or expression she didn’t mean to show. Not fear, exactly. More like she was asking the house permission to leave me alone in it.

The kitchen door clicked shut behind her.

And for the first time since I arrived, I realized she wasn’t the only one trying to reconnect.

The house was too.

After breakfast, I walked down the hall toward the living room, telling myself I was just stretching my legs, just retracing old territory to ground myself. The boards under my feet creaked in that familiar uneven pattern, like someone matching my steps half a beat behind. 

The air shifted in temperature as I passed each doorway, growing slightly warmer near the bathroom then cooler near the coat closet. These were changes I remembered from childhood, but back then I always thought it was just the house being old. 

Now the pattern felt almost intentional.

When I pushed open the living room door, the world around me stuttered.

It wasn’t immediate, not like a jump scare or a sudden hallucination. It was gradual, like reality rearranged itself one forgotten detail at a time. 

The light changed first—turning harsher, yellowed, the way it used to when the old lamp near the sofa gave off that buzz before dying. 

The rug on the floor blurred at the edges, then sharpened into the pattern we’d replaced years ago. The smell in the air shifted too, sour and sharp, the remnants of a spoiled smoothie she once threw at me because I forgot to take out the trash.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. Every breath felt weighted.
A figure appeared near the far wall—my mother, but not her. Younger. Shoulders drawn back the way they were when anger rolled through her like a storm she couldn’t outrun. 

Her face wasn’t clear; it flickered at the edges, the features refusing to settle—never showing a clear expression. 

She crossed the room with those short, furious steps I remembered too vividly, her hand raised not to strike but to emphasize something she was yelling so passionately about.

I could hear her voice, muffled, warped, repeating the same sentence in a loop that didn’t match her mouth. The sound was low, almost subterranean, like someone speaking underwater.

Then I saw him.

The boy stood near the sofa, small and thin, shoulders curled inward. He didn’t look up. His hair fell across his face in the same uneven way mine did at ten years old. 

His hands were tucked against his stomach—bruises along the left side of his face, one arm clutching the wrist of the other—a protective posture I remembered without wanting to. He wasn’t exactly solid. His outline flickered, bending in and out of the room’s lighting like a shadow caught between frames of a film.

The air around me constricted. My chest ached with a pressure that wasn’t panic but something deeper, older, ingrained into the muscle memory of childhood fear.

The woman’s voice grew sharper—harsher—the sound flattening into a jagged tone that didn’t belong to any language. The boy flinched without moving. The room darkened at the corners, shadows pooling and stretching until they pressed against the edges of the scene like hands pushing through thin fabric.

Then the memory warped.

The woman’s head snapped toward me—not quickly, but with a dragging, unnatural slowness, like something pulling a body through thick mud. 

Her face was still obscured, but something beneath the blur leaned forward, sharpening into an intent rather than a feature. Her arm lifted again, but instead of pointing at the boy, it pointed at me.

The sound in the room cut out. Every noise. Every hum. Even my breath.

She kept eye contact as she grabbed the boy by the ear. She shook him around while yelling furiously before shoving him as hard as she could. The boy’s head cracked against the wall before he fell on the floor, unconscious.

Something pressed against my chest—not physically, but from the inside, the pressure of a feeling recognizing itself. The scene froze. Then it shattered in an instant, the room snapping back into the present with a crack that echoed through the floorboards like something heavy falling upstairs.
The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

Except the wall behind me had a dent in it.
A small, round impact at the exact height of a child’s head.

I stared at it until the air around me started to vibrate with that low, pulsing hum I remembered from nights when everything felt too loud to be silent. The house seemed to exhale, slow and satisfied, like it had shown me something it needed me to see.

The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

But I wasn’t.

My legs felt hollow, like they were remembering how it felt to go weak under her grip. I stood there staring at the empty spot where the boy had hit the wall, and my body reacted before my mind did. 

My knees locked. My breathing shortened. My palms went numb. A whole childhood of learned responses waking up all at once, like a survival instinct I hadn't even realized I still carried.

I didn’t need to tell myself it was real. I knew it. I knew it the way you know the taste of blood in your mouth or the sound of your own name being screamed. Seeing it again didn’t rewrite anything—it just took the seal off a memory I had kept boxed up so tightly I’d convinced myself it was smaller than it was. 

But watching it play out in front of me, watching her hand in the boy’s hair, the way she shook him, the way his head cracked against the wall… there was no minimizing that. No distancing it. It was like seeing a crime scene you were a witness to and finally allowing yourself to admit it counted.

My stomach twisted. I pressed a hand over it and felt myself fold forward slightly, like the pressure might keep everything inside me from spilling out. The room was too quiet. Sickeningly quiet. I could almost hear the echo of her shouting in the corners, a sound that still lived somewhere in the drywall whether the house wanted to admit it or not.

I backed away until I felt the edge of the coffee table hit the back of my leg, then sank down onto it because standing felt wrong, like I was taking up too much space in a room that still remembered how small I used to be. I rubbed my hands together, trying to ground myself, but they kept shaking. 

It wasn’t fear of the house. It wasn’t fear of whatever the fuck happened. It was the simple, humiliating fear of being a child again in a place that made me one.

I lifted my head and looked around the living room—the real one, the present one—and suddenly every object felt loaded with history. The lamp she’d knocked over during an argument. The rug she’d once dragged me across. The uneven scuff on the baseboard where my heel had hit when she shoved me. 

Nothing supernatural about any of it in the moment. Just the truth of a place where bad things happened.

I swallowed hard. My throat felt scraped raw, like I’d been screaming even though I hadn’t said a single word.

The heater kicked on suddenly, loud and mechanical, but the noise didn’t comfort me. It only reminded me how loud the house could get when it wanted to drown everything else out. I pressed my fingertips to my temples, trying to think, trying to breathe past the thick feeling in my chest.

“This is what happened,” I whispered to no one, just to hear it out loud.

Saying it didn’t make it easier.

But it felt honest.

And honesty in this house felt dangerous.

I looked back toward the spot where the boy—where I—had fallen. The room was calm again, still as a photograph. But something in the silence felt charged, like the house wasn’t just showing me a memory.

It was reminding me.

Reminding me that it remembered everything, even the things I tried to forget.",3,1764017249.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

For a second, it felt… almost normal.

But then she glanced toward the corner of the room, quick and subtle, like checking that something wasn’t listening. The motion was so fast I almost missed it, but not fast enough to pretend it wasn’t there.

I followed her gaze out of instinct.

Nothing was there. Just the empty corner where the paint was peeling.

Still, something in the air felt aware. As if the house was leaning closer.

She stood abruptly, gathering plates even though I was still eating. “I should get dressed,” she said. “Traffic’s bad on weekdays. But—what time should I pick you up? Is around 3 or 4 okay?”

I swallowed my food, throat tight.

“Whenever,” I said.

She nodded. But when she turned away, I caught a flicker—some shadow or expression she didn’t mean to show. Not fear, exactly. More like she was asking the house permission to leave me alone in it.

The kitchen door clicked shut behind her.

And for the first time since I arrived, I realized she wasn’t the only one trying to reconnect.

The house was too.

After breakfast, I walked down the hall toward the living room, telling myself I was just stretching my legs, just retracing old territory to ground myself. The boards under my feet creaked in that familiar uneven pattern, like someone matching my steps half a beat behind. 

The air shifted in temperature as I passed each doorway, growing slightly warmer near the bathroom then cooler near the coat closet. These were changes I remembered from childhood, but back then I always thought it was just the house being old. 

Now the pattern felt almost intentional.

When I pushed open the living room door, the world around me stuttered.

It wasn’t immediate, not like a jump scare or a sudden hallucination. It was gradual, like reality rearranged itself one forgotten detail at a time. 

The light changed first—turning harsher, yellowed, the way it used to when the old lamp near the sofa gave off that buzz before dying. 

The rug on the floor blurred at the edges, then sharpened into the pattern we’d replaced years ago. The smell in the air shifted too, sour and sharp, the remnants of a spoiled smoothie she once threw at me because I forgot to take out the trash.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. Every breath felt weighted.
A figure appeared near the far wall—my mother, but not her. Younger. Shoulders drawn back the way they were when anger rolled through her like a storm she couldn’t outrun. 

Her face wasn’t clear; it flickered at the edges, the features refusing to settle—never showing a clear expression. 

She crossed the room with those short, furious steps I remembered too vividly, her hand raised not to strike but to emphasize something she was yelling so passionately about.

I could hear her voice, muffled, warped, repeating the same sentence in a loop that didn’t match her mouth. The sound was low, almost subterranean, like someone speaking underwater.

Then I saw him.

The boy stood near the sofa, small and thin, shoulders curled inward. He didn’t look up. His hair fell across his face in the same uneven way mine did at ten years old. 

His hands were tucked against his stomach—bruises along the left side of his face, one arm clutching the wrist of the other—a protective posture I remembered without wanting to. He wasn’t exactly solid. His outline flickered, bending in and out of the room’s lighting like a shadow caught between frames of a film.

The air around me constricted. My chest ached with a pressure that wasn’t panic but something deeper, older, ingrained into the muscle memory of childhood fear.

The woman’s voice grew sharper—harsher—the sound flattening into a jagged tone that didn’t belong to any language. The boy flinched without moving. The room darkened at the corners, shadows pooling and stretching until they pressed against the edges of the scene like hands pushing through thin fabric.

Then the memory warped.

The woman’s head snapped toward me—not quickly, but with a dragging, unnatural slowness, like something pulling a body through thick mud. 

Her face was still obscured, but something beneath the blur leaned forward, sharpening into an intent rather than a feature. Her arm lifted again, but instead of pointing at the boy, it pointed at me.

The sound in the room cut out. Every noise. Every hum. Even my breath.

She kept eye contact as she grabbed the boy by the ear. She shook him around while yelling furiously before shoving him as hard as she could. The boy’s head cracked against the wall before he fell on the floor, unconscious.

Something pressed against my chest—not physically, but from the inside, the pressure of a feeling recognizing itself. The scene froze. Then it shattered in an instant, the room snapping back into the present with a crack that echoed through the floorboards like something heavy falling upstairs.
The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

Except the wall behind me had a dent in it.
A small, round impact at the exact height of a child’s head.

I stared at it until the air around me started to vibrate with that low, pulsing hum I remembered from nights when everything felt too loud to be silent. The house seemed to exhale, slow and satisfied, like it had shown me something it needed me to see.

The living room was ordinary again—quiet, dim, unchanged.

But I wasn’t.

My legs felt hollow, like they were remembering how it felt to go weak under her grip. I stood there staring at the empty spot where the boy had hit the wall, and my body reacted before my mind did. 

My knees locked. My breathing shortened. My palms went numb. A whole childhood of learned responses waking up all at once, like a survival instinct I hadn't even realized I still carried.

I didn’t need to tell myself it was real. I knew it. I knew it the way you know the taste of blood in your mouth or the sound of your own name being screamed. Seeing it again didn’t rewrite anything—it just took the seal off a memory I had kept boxed up so tightly I’d convinced myself it was smaller than it was. 

But watching it play out in front of me, watching her hand in the boy’s hair, the way she shook him, the way his head cracked against the wall… there was no minimizing that. No distancing it. It was like seeing a crime scene you were a witness to and finally allowing yourself to admit it counted.

My stomach twisted. I pressed a hand over it and felt myself fold forward slightly, like the pressure might keep everything inside me from spilling out. The room was too quiet. Sickeningly quiet. I could almost hear the echo of her shouting in the corners, a sound that still lived somewhere in the drywall whether the house wanted to admit it or not.

I backed away until I felt the edge of the coffee table hit the back of my leg, then sank down onto it because standing felt wrong, like I was taking up too much space in a room that still remembered how small I used to be. I rubbed my hands together, trying to ground myself, but they kept shaking. 

It wasn’t fear of the house. It wasn’t fear of whatever the fuck happened. It was the simple, humiliating fear of being a child again in a place that made me one.

I lifted my head and looked around the living room—the real one, the present one—and suddenly every object felt loaded with history. The lamp she’d knocked over during an argument. The rug she’d once dragged me across. The uneven scuff on the baseboard where my heel had hit when she shoved me. 

Nothing supernatural about any of it in the moment. Just the truth of a place where bad things happened.

I swallowed hard. My throat felt scraped raw, like I’d been screaming even though I hadn’t said a single word.

The heater kicked on suddenly, loud and mechanical, but the noise didn’t comfort me. It only reminded me how loud the house could get when it wanted to drown everything else out. I pressed my fingertips to my temples, trying to think, trying to breathe past the thick feeling in my chest.

“This is what happened,” I whispered to no one, just to hear it out loud.

Saying it didn’t make it easier.

But it felt honest.

And honesty in this house felt dangerous.

I looked back toward the spot where the boy—where I—had fallen. The room was calm again, still as a photograph. But something in the silence felt charged, like the house wasn’t just showing me a memory.

It was reminding me.

Reminding me that it remembered everything, even the worst.",9,1764017114.0,nosleep,1,0.91,False

Recently as part of my schools program I've been working unpaid in a cafe, front of house and I've really been enjoying it, I really love making coffee and getting to chat to regulars and coworkers there I was trying to get an actual job there on weekends but they aren't hiring at the moment. 

in the meantime I decided to try get a different job in a cafe until I could get this place, I saw one that had been hiring a while, It was a bit far but the advertised pay seemed very good (especially for a teenager)
and they really needent someone so I thaught I had a good chance. anyways I expressed interest in a front of house position, the likes of taking orders making coffee and serving food very similar to what I am doing at this other place and enjoying, anyways the manager got back to me saying a position was available and that I should come up for a chat and just go through some stuff

when I went up for this it seemed fine, they seemed friendly enough but a little awkward, we chatted a bit talking about what I had been previously doing, the cafe was alright, not like the one I have been at in anyway but for something short it was fine. the advertised pay was fine and as long as I was working 4-6 hour shifts id be happy

later that week I got an email saying I had gotten the position, upon accepting I got told that the pay was €9.50 instead of €14 an hour and that the shifts were 8 and a half hours with half an hour break (no flexibility). Again thinking of it as temporary I still accepted, just less exited about it. 

First day was yesterday, I got in at 9:30am to the manager telling me to get into the kitchen and showed me how to use the dishwasher, I was confused as I had not been hired to this position but I assumed it was just a shared task. I was wrong, 7 hours yesterday I was in there receiving trays and then washing and restocking, I was given very loose instructions and was given out whenever I did anything wrong even though I was not told about it. 

throughout the day the coworkers seemed quite rude in the sense listed above, they weren't friendly to me and if I tried to join conversation with any of them I was just pushed away and they wouldn't let me join in, whenever I tried to go out of the kitchen for a minute if the dishes had stopped the people front of house just gave out to me saying I had to be back in the kitchen despite them too standing around doing very little

when it got busy I was having a really rough time, It was my first day, they were giving out to me left right and center and I was so tired after doing it for hours that I was shaking from tiredness during my break, I had a terrible headache all day and I just felt like crying. it was in know way what I had signed up for and the coworkers were in no way helpful. 

towards the end of the day I was tasked with cleaning everywhere with one other worker, she talked me through the tasks with no detail and when I started doing it she was just complaining about what I was doing and critiquing every last thing I was doing despite it being what she told me at the start. I was really getting fed up of this lady she was just so rude and the only thing keeping me going was the idea of quitting. at the end of the day I asked if I could go then, the manager said because of me we weren't finished yet and that I had been holding them all up I WAS WORKING HARDER THAN ANY OF THEM, also I enquired about tips but he said due to being new I don't get any, like what the fuck?

I just had such a shit time there yesterday, nothing was good, the staff, the hours, the pay was shit and most importantly the job I was doing was not what I was hired to do if I wanted to be a kitchen porter I would have went to a restaurant and got pair €15 an hour with a shorter shift. I don't mind working hard but this is not the work I was hired to do, and the staff made it a horrible experience with how they treated me. 

Is this kind of thing normal with this kind of job, at the place I'm doing the experience with there's none of this toxic environment, and the people I'm with in the other place are doing the same work as me and that's fine. just yesterday in this new place was terrible I don't know what to do, whether I try to stick it out or I just quit and wait for a different place, I really don't want to continue with that it's not what I want but I don't want to have to quit after one day but I feel I have to. there's only so much I can tolerate I just wasnt expecting all that for a first day. idk what to do

1p5sgwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldercare/comments/1p5sgwd/moms_stomach_and_eating_little/,Mom's Stomach and Eating Little,"Mom is 86. I’m sure she has some dementia—definitely sundowning—but she refuses to see a doctor. I’m her only caretaker and live with her. My brother doesn’t help, my sister is on oxygen waiting for a lung transplant, and the grandkids/great-grandkids don’t step in at all.

Her stubbornness has gotten worse over the past couple of years. She lies—sometimes intentionally, sometimes because she forgets. Her eating has become extremely limited. She’s always been picky, but now she mainly eats starches: potatoes, bread, chips, English muffins. She won’t touch bananas anymore and stopped eating ice cream and cookies, which used to be nightly favorites.

Last Tuesday, after the usual struggle about food, she asked for hush puppies. I got them, and I thought she ate them all. The next day I caught her drinking Pepto; she said her stomach got upset. The last time she had an upset stomach she refused to eat for a week, dropped to 118–120, and never gained back to 130.

She didn’t eat Wednesday or Thursday but stayed hydrated with coffee (2–3 cups a day). Friday I weighed her—114 lbs, about five pounds down from two weeks ago. Likely some of that was water loss.

I’ve learned not to push her because she digs in. I just told her I wished she’d try to eat because she was losing weight. About 20 minutes later she asked for sweet potatoes. I made a big one with butter and brown sugar plus cheese toast. She ate well and said she felt better, but later was back to Pepto.

She didn’t eat Saturday. On Saturday night I discovered most of the hush puppies from Tuesday night in a bowl in the refrigerator. So I'm not sure whether those upset her stomach or whether her stomach had already been upset and she did not want to tell me. I am her son, and I think she is more embarrassed talking about that stuff with me because I am a male. After I moved in a few years ago to take are of her, I noticed that when she goes to the restroom she turns the water on so I cannot hear her in there. 

 Sunday she ate a plain English muffin. I don’t think she’s drinking water—she seems to be nursing the same bottle. She ate a couple of crackers today and said her stomach “hurts some.” She’s still getting up and dressed, but her energy is lower than when this started.

I’m at a loss. She refuses to see a doctor, and I have zero backup. If I had even one family member to stand with me, I think she’d finally agree to go. But with just me, she’ll shut down or lash out. I’m worried about the weight loss and that she’s not honest about her stomach. I think she gets scared to eat, then doesn’t eat, which lets acid build up and keeps her stomach irritated. That one English muffin wasn’t enough to break that cycle.",1,1764016760.0,eldercare,3,1.0,False

1. I love the look of the Rocket Apartamento, and most E61 machines honestly, but the thought of waiting half an hour for the machine to heat up sounds horrible.
2. I do not want to spend 6, 7, 8 grand on a La Marzocco (as much as I would love to have one).
3. Getting another Breville just feels like I will be back in the same place in a year, even if I get one of their dual boilers.

Since this community is just getting started, I wanted to share the little story behind the name StudyForever - because, yes, it wasn’t chosen randomly or out of academic trauma (well… maybe just a little).

The idea for this name came to me on a night when I was surrounded by open textbooks, three empty coffee cups, and the painful realization that learning never actually stops. Even when you finish school, college, courses - you’re still learning something new. Life basically looked at me and said: “Congrats, you’ll be studying… forever.”

But instead of seeing that as suffering, I decided to make it something empowering.  
**StudyForever** isn’t about endless grind - it’s about the idea that your brain is an unlimited upgrade machine. There’s always another skill to learn, another trick to try, another way to improve. It’s a reminder that we’re all leveling up continuously, not just until finals.

The name also felt right because this sub isn’t only for students - it’s for anyone who loves learning or wants to get better at it. Whether you’re cramming, exploring new topics, organizing your academic chaos, or just trying to survive the semester with minimal crying - you belong here.

So welcome to StudyForever - the place where learning never stops, and that’s actually a good thing.",1,1764016498.0,StudyForever,0,1.0,False

Main interaction we had was discussing books interests, was in a group activity and i pretty quiet but she started asking me questions and basically we just nice discussed on books she reads a bit and how i read poetry, also she hates annotating in books and i do it all the time for the poetry books. idk much about her so i rlly like her on looks and good vibes overall. I dont have her socials and i prefer not to request since they're private mode.

friend of mine said i could give her a book say like: hey \_\_\_, sorry to bother, just remembered our convo about books and thought u might enjoy this book, here cya  
and then in the book there would be some corny note with my phone number saying like hey im quite interested in you so if ud like we could go have a coffee or smt someday phone#

I feel like thats kinda too much like idk her and a whole ass book, bro i like my books dont want to loose them, maybe i should use a note instead (feels childish)?  
and well i dont rlly have time to try to build a connection, so like any advice pls? anybody feel like the book thing is not as stupid as im thinking it is? any other way yall think i should do this? Should i straigth up go up to her and ask? im so clueless ive had 1 relationship before and honestly kinda scared of rejection but i do understand my chances being like near 0 so this would more be like practice in a way

TLDR: girl in my class i want to ask out, almost never interacted, one week left to classes, how should i go about it?",1,1764016497.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I Wish I Hadn’t Seen It At All.,"Many years ago, I was living in my parents’ basement apartment — a dim, quiet space that always felt colder than the rest of the house. It wasn’t just the temperature; the air carried this heavy stillness, like the room itself was holding its breath.

One night, I was curled up on the sofa watching a movie. My dog was pressed against my side, half-asleep, and my cat was batting at something on the far side of the coffee table. Everything was calm.

Then, without warning, they both froze.

My dog’s head lifted, ears forward. My cat stopped mid-pounce. They weren’t looking at each other; they were staring at the space above the coffee table, as if something were floating there.

My dog let out a low, rumbling growl. My cat’s pupils blew wide, his eyes flicking in tiny, sharp movements as if tracking something I couldn’t see. I muted the TV and leaned forward, trying to figure out what had caught their attention.

That’s when I saw it.

Hovering over the coffee table was something I can only describe as a heat wave — the same shimmering distortion you see above a barbecue on a hot day. The air warped and twisted, blurring the space around it. And both animals were locked onto it, reacting as though it were something alive. The room suddenly felt smaller, like the walls were drawing in around us.

A chill ran straight through me. The moment felt wrong, too real, too deliberate. I snapped off the TV, grabbed both pets, and bolted upstairs. I slept on my parents’ sofa that night with the lights on and the dog trembling against me.

I tried to brush it off in the weeks that followed. A trick of the light. My imagination. A coincidence with the animals. But the thought of that shifting air lingered in the back of my mind, creeping into my dreams.

A year later, something happened that made me rethink all of it.

I had fallen asleep watching a movie in the basement again. Sometime in the early hours, I woke — or thought I woke — to the sound of that same low growl from my dog. But when I tried to open my eyes, I couldn’t. My whole body was frozen. I was trapped in sleep paralysis, fully aware of the room around me but unable to move.

I could hear my dog standing beside the sofa, that deep, warning growl vibrating through the darkness. I screamed inside my own head, trying to force my eyes open, trying to move even a finger. It felt like something else was in the room with us, the same presence the animals had sensed before. The air felt thick, charged, like it was pressing down on my chest.

Finally, with a jolt, I snapped out of the paralysis. The room was pitch black, the TV screen gone idle, and my dog was staring into the darkness as if she still saw something there — but this time, hovering directly above me.

I didn’t wait to find out what it was.

I grabbed her, ran upstairs again, and never slept alone in that basement again.",0,1764016494.0,Paranormal,9,0.5,False

The only hobbies I’ve done in public, and only a handful of times, is journaling and reading. However I also enjoy creative activities like painting and coloring, but have never been brave enough to do it in public since I’m really no good at it. I also like playing on my Nintendo switch, but have only played it at home. 

I think the reason I’m a little nervous about doing them in public spaces is feeling like I’m being judged for doing ‘childish’ activities, even though I know plenty of adults also enjoy doing them. 

I’ve also been dabbling in some low stakes creations with building with Legos and these blocks called “Plus Plus” that connect together and can make some neat designs with them. Again, I enjoy using these freely in my home, but wonder if I’d be perceived as weird if I were to pull them out at a coffee shop table or restaurant and start playing with them.

1p5s4sc,https://i.redd.it/4vsswkhtf93g1.jpeg,[Huge Update] Frosted Glass v1.3 is here! 🚀 Customize colors & backgrounds via UI (No YAML!) with the new Theme Manager,"Hey everyone! 👋

It’s been an incredible journey since I first shared the **Frosted Glass Theme**. To be honest, I never expected it to reach this level. Watching it become one of the highly-starred themes for Home Assistant has been surreal, and I am truly humbled by this amazing community.

From day one, the **#1 most requested feature** has been easier customization. You wanted to change the primary color or the background image without diving into thousands of lines of code.

**I heard you. And today, I’m delivering that.**

Introducing **Frosted Glass v1.3** and the brand new **Frosted Glass Theme Manager integration**! 🛠️

# 🎨 Customize your experience without touching a single line of YAML.

The **Frosted Glass Theme Manager** is a powerful companion integration that lets you tweak the aesthetic directly from your Home Assistant settings.

**What can it do?**

* 🌈 **UI Color Picker:** Just pick your favorite color for Light and Dark modes.
* 🧠 **Smart Tonal Palette:** It doesn’t just swap one color. The integration mathematically calculates a full Material Design tonal palette (shades from 05 to 95) based on your selection, ensuring perfect contrast and readability is maintained.
* 🖼️ **Custom Backgrounds:** Want a different wallpaper? Just paste the URL.
* ⚡ **Instant Generation:** Click ""Submit"" and it automatically generates both the **Full** (blurred) and **Lite** (performance optimized) versions of your custom theme.

# ❤️ A massive Thank You

I really can't wait to see what you all build with this new flexibility. Please share your screenshots!

I also want to express my deepest gratitude for every star on GitHub, every bug report, and especially to those who supported me via Buy Me a Coffee. Every single donation means the world to me and keeps me motivated to push this project further.

* **Theme Manager Repository:** \[[GitHub Link](https://github.com/wessamlauf/frosted-glass-manager)\]

# 📝 A Note on Transparency & Performance

I’m also aware that some of you occasionally experience issues where transparency or blur doesn’t load correctly on certain cards. Please know that I am monitoring this closely.

To give you some context: **Frosted Glass is a beast.** While standard themes usually run on \~400-500 lines of code, this project exceeds **1,000 lines**. It utilizes heavy CSS backdrop filters and effects that really push the limits of Home Assistant’s current rendering engine.

I have optimized the code as much as humanly (with help of AI as well) possible to keep it snappy, but at this moment, we are operating at the very edge of what the system allows. I appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate these limits!

Enjoy! 🥂 - Wessam ",53,1764015998.0,homeassistant,16,0.9,False

Help please,"I 28M felt this weird problem few years ago when i ate something and immediately threw up, i was feeling nauseous all night and in the morning was panting due to loss of energy i guess (i was 23 i guess)

Cut to last year in april I left my job because i wanted to focus on my dental treatments regular health etc cause i was tried brain fog and many other weird symptoms like feet pain etc. Upon running first set of checkups i was diagnosed with minor thyroid (the weight gain one) and i have always been underweight or in normal BMI before that, i also got diagnosed w B12 and vit D deficiency. Doctor gave me an injection course for same and i took it. I started my regular medicine (thyronorm 25 mcg) for thyroid. It runs in the family my dad my grand mom my aunt all have it. I was a bit concerned but I decide to help myself. I was really down because of stress of all these things plus no job no distractions and i already have anxiety and a bit of ADHD. But with help of therapy i was feeling a bit better. I used to take mild walks sometimes bit of weights skipping Zumba etc and was able to keep my weight intact. I was always a fan of cooking so used to make so many tasty yet healthy meals at home as i had no job less responsibility and was trying to focus in my health.

Only home cooked food very less to no outside food. I was never and alcoholic or smoker but i stopped having even basic tasting of alcohol cause before i got thyroid or even took break from work i used to feel a bit bloated after eating pizza (from chains like dominos) fast food random spicy oily stuff or sodas. So i got my weight to normal i was anyways just one or two kgs ahead of my weight. Then when checked my thyroid was decent b12 was fine but my vit D was 95 which indicated kidney failure. Doctor who gave me injections said its just hypervitaminosis even the lab said so cause i was taking meds for dental pain which were painkillers and calcium rich stuff too maybe? Then i shed the excess by drinking water and it all came well in my report last october.

Cut to november i am supposed to leave for an even next day and i am unable to burp digest properly feeling very tired, loss of breath palpitation. My mother thought i was stressed because of illness not being able to work etc but i was lowkey happy that my vitals were now okay. I was gonna meet my fav person from the industry (design). I ended up going and had the worst night kept falling asleep only bodily brain wasn't shutting down was panting too much. Luckily my boyfriend was with me and somehow made sure to stay up and take care. I went to my aunts place thinking it will feel better but it just got worse only was on lemonade electrolytes etc. Also got my period and it worsened.

When i came back home and went to dox she gave me medicine for a week. Took it but no diff. Then changed and gave me acidity and sleep meds to help me as my mom was hinting at stress only and i was pissed cause what i felt was way deeper than stress it was scary creepy keeping me up unable to burp digest acidity and then more acidity by not being able to eat well.

Funnily enough before this thing happened like mentioned earlier i was eating home food light work out and better things than before for sure and it still happened. After taking the meds w sleep meds it got better and did nit come back for a while.

I got a job moved to a diff city did house hunting had worst job lifestyle no lunch dinner timings work all the time late nights and it still does not come up. I also had worst stress cause salaries were not coming i had rent and bills to pay was old enough to not ask fam but still it never came. I left that job got another came back home and now i have got it again.

The three to four times that it felt like i might not wake up tomorrow because it was that scary it was before my periods so i thought can be hormonal, my digestion had also worsened randomly i would eat something and feel like my stomach will burst had i not shat that very moment.

Symptoms-

Poor digestion
Burping 30 times min after meals
When i swallow liquids or saliva throat sticks and gives choking feeling (creepy deadly)
Don't feel good or rested or ready for sleep till the series if burps ends (for sometime the burps were normal but are now acidic too)
Have palpitation panting etc
Feel little series of bubbles pooping up in my feet
Upper abdomen pain or fatigue

Things done-

Initially stopped eating junk or spicy ir ouly rarely have it once in 2 months.

South indian breakfast has been holy grail specially when its soft and moist.

Never had tea in my life likes coffee a bit stopped both 

Could never have any sodas for acidity so stopped having them otherwise also

Try to sleep on my left instinctively

Take 2 pillows whenever possible

Went to GE specialist he asked for bloodwork sonography and endoscopy.

Will get these done in next week as i get appt.

I am in a slightly decent workplace that will try and let me save myself and not butcher peace for work. So will take that liberty on focus but v scared of chronic diseases.

Is this
Acid reflux?
GERD?
Gall bladder stone?
IBS?

People say it is stress i say i get stress because of this. Could be stress making me sick and sickness stressing me. Health giving anxiety and anxiety screwing up health.

Any doctors patients anyone is free to share their journey, enlighten me cause my fam is sometimes v nonchalant or sometimes super scared.

P.S. i have had other hormonal symptoms like breast pain and had taken meds for it. I am on my thyroid med now but unable to workout as i feel physically rot all the time like my gut organs are all doing a WWE inside sucking up all my power pulling my throat etc. pls help if possible",1,1764015892.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

My eyes flickered open,my throat dry,heart aching and head throbbing. I knew what happened but I didn't want to accept it.

Let me go back. I used to be bullied. A tall,blonde girl with sharp ocean blue eyes,rosey pink lips and always wearing skimpy skirts. Her name was Maya. She always got away with bullying me. From dumping coffee on me to making me feel useless,insignificant. She was the queen bee of the school,popular,pretty,even the principal's daughter. Once....she followed me home,throwing rocks at the window like the holy terror she was! It hit my mum's head,she didn't see it coming and couldn't handle the strain of recovery....

She didn't make it...

It drew me insane. Every time I closed my eyes I could see mum. i could see my mum's sweet smile,she used to be the heart of the home,she loved me,but I could see it in her eyes. She couldn't protect me from seeing her wither away in front of her and I couldn't save her either. Every night for two months that single memory haunted me.

So...I did it. I killed her behind the school in cold blood. I killed her and ran.However,seeing her die,seeing her get what she deserved,it felt like pulling off a tight bandage off my wound! Then,I disappeared,without a trace. No one remembered. No one wanted to remember that the sweet nerdy kid turned into a cold blooded killer. They didn't care I lost everything! They looked past it,they made me out to be the villain and that's why I became one. I became a villain as a cornered animal became the monster they feared. And then,i lost. I died and the hero won. After all,that's how the cookie crumbles or whatever those judgemental heroes say. The hero wins,the villain dies and that's the end. But it wasn't.

Every time,the excruciating pain of death ended and i woke up again,the hero standing over me with tools saying 'I'm losing followers'. Cause in his twisted mind, losing followers was a good enough reason to keep me kept away from the sweet embrace of death. I don't even want to be the villain anymore but now....that's all people see me as, At this point,this hero simply has an ego too big to accept that if I die he becomes irrelavent. I don't know why I'm cursed to this fate but I know once that damned,cruel hero dies,I'll be free. Free to die as something not known as a monster.

I think. Maybe more, but it's hard to say. Maybe its just an anxiety disorder, but it's hard to say. I've found a lot of mental health disorder symptoms have an extreme amount of cross-over, and a diagnosis is only helpful if it actually helps ppl deal with their issues. THIS ISNT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST FIGURE OUT AND BOOM ITS BETTER. That doesnt mean it doesn't get better. Life, emotions and stress are all fluid. I've had good days, good weeks, been able to function like my ""old self"", and done things in the past year that I'm very proud of in spite of living with DPDR. I've also had bad days, bad weeks, anxiety and panic that have left me crippled, and yet I'm still here. Through symptoms of losing sense of self, feeling like Im looking at my life and perception from the outside in, and existential fear of day to day life things that Ik is irrational, IM STILL HERE. It's hard but, in my humble opinion the way to heal is to go on living life the best you can. Accept your mental health limitations, as they aren't under your control and appreciate what you can. The taste of your coffee, how cozy your bed is whatever. None of that is going anywhere even if your mental health SUCKS. Time is the great normalizer, as long as you can keep going there will be moments of joy, bliss, pain and whatever. Life will continue, and i think if you're dedicated to continuing it will lead to some sort of homeostasis. Sorry this is kinda jumbled. Lol",1,1764015727.0,dpdr,2,1.0,False

# Training

To make a long story short, the come back from having a baby has been pretty brutal. its been nothing but injury (posterior tibial tendinitis brought on by collapsed arches and a brandy new autoimmune disease). I've felt like any time I try to scale up my mileage I reawaken my post tib tendon injury. Frustrated, I finally hired a coach this year and I credit her with getting me to Philadelphia - I definitely would have reinjured myself on my own hook.

That said it wasn't a perfect block and it had its set backs.

* Low mileage - I started this block with barely 12 MPW. I am glad I had a coach for this who knew how to get me there on such low mileage rather than me rushing to get to 15 or 20 to fit a pre done online plan.
* Bronchitis. I got sick sometime in September 😒. it took me out for a week
* Posterior tibial tendinitis + immune response - my foot had been bothering me at about a 1-2 on the pain scale for several weeks. my PT had cautioned me this would be normal for me with collapsed arches. but then after a long run - 10 miles - that was *brutal.* Not only could I not stick to my 10 min HMP but my stress incontinence was also back in full swing (luteal phase iykyk). After that run its like my right foot just seized up. my ankle swelled up, I lost mobility in the foot, it couldn't bear weight. I thought Philadelphia was over. I rushed to urgent care for x-rays to rule out a fracture. it got so bad so fast I was half convinced I'd have a fresh fracture somehow. thankfully, no fracture! I took another week off doing gentle PT first with no load bearing just mobility then slowly adding load back in. I walked the dog, I cross trained on my bike. by the 6th day I was able to run again. its bizarre how fast it came on but then also how fast it went away. I'll never know because I'm not a dr but I suspect my autoimmune disease put its thumb on the scale a bit.

# Pre-race

against all odds me and my bum foot got to philly!  I'd carb loaded, weirdly, *shrimp scampi on linguine* all week. its now my go to. I really think it helped lmao.

we got to philadelphia friday. I went down to the convention center at 4:30 to get my bib. oh my god. I was there closer to 6 it was *packed*.

that night I agonized over whether 4 am would be early enough. I like an hour to get up, get coffee, eat, poop *several* times (yay ulcerative colitis 😒) before I head out. I knew it'd take 10 ish to walk to walk to the starting line and security opened at 5. but I also heard it gets backed up *fast*. it all ended up being moot - I didn't sleep at all the night before anyway. I camped out in our bathroom with coffee and overnight oats I'd brought with me. we only could secure a single room so I was desperate not to wake my 4yo at 4 am  running the keurieg 🙃.

I did get to the race on time with plenty to spare. 5:30 am had zero backup at security. unfortunately it was pouring out. i was wearing a zip up and sweat pants over my running clothes (oiselle pockito shorts and a janji long sleeve top) but my shoes were soaked within minutes of walking to the start. I avoided puddles as best as I could but it didn't seem to matter.

they had put out a warming tent which was nice. I found a seat (again, no one around, this filled up FAST) and proceeded to dry out while nibbling on a whole foods waffle I'd brought.

at 6:30 the rain had stopped and I went and found a portapotty for a final bladder dump

my corral - E - ended up going around 7:30 am.

# Race

I felt great for awhile. Miles 1-6 were actually fun. I felt like I had no problem sticking to my paces. looking at the splits, I, ah, *didn't* stick to my paces but thats not for lack of trying I'm just poor at pacing.

Miles 7-9 I knew were mostly uphill but it wasn't as bad as what I've seen running around north jersey. I kept these slower figuring I would bank time on the downhills and recoup on the flats.

Unfortunately, around mile 5-6ish is when the chafing began :(. I've run in the pockito shorts a thousand times and I've never had this issue. generally my thighs never chafe. Look, my thighs rub together like every other red blooded American woman that ever was or will be. but they just don't chafe. til Saturday. I blame shaving. not to like, get to into it, but I get a few spare black hairs along my inner thigh and, in the name of vanity, I shaved. well never again friends. I bet if I'd left it alone the hairs - blonde and black - would have been smooth and non irritating.

I also started to get really bad blistering on my feet. both outer big toes, my right arch, my left  like .. big toe knuckle .. and what felt like the tips of most of my toes. I had the big brain idea to pull my shorts down (yay high waisted lol) to protect the hot spots on my thighs but there was just nothing I could do about my feet.

I'd hoped to have more in the tank for miles 10-13. I kept telling myself ""its a 5k, its nothing! we can do anything for 30 minutes!"" but I was for the most part totally done in. I realized around now that I had miscounted my gels to boot. I'd planned to eat 1 serving from a cliff blok pack + 1 gu every 25 minutes (this equals about 46g carbs every 30 ish for a total of 90ish for the hour. ya'll I brought 2 cliff energy blok packs (so 4 servings) but only *three* gu gels. I should have brought *5*.

I still finished strong. that mile 12 was like a frantic desperate bid for the surface of a drowning swimmer. My husband texted me saying to look out for the golden horse and that he had our son on his shoulders on the right and man I was DESPERATE to see that horse. I was convinced I had missed the horse. It felt like if I didn't see them I would fall down dead and need to be carried off the course. the relief when I glimpsed the horse a few turns down the road. seeing my kid's huge eyes and dimples and he smiles so big was everything.

at that point I just ran lol. my watch was saying 13 miles and I was trying not to think of how I'd feel when, since my watch had been BEHIND the mile markers the whole time, I passed the like .. physical 13th mile marker. luckily that didn't happen. I finished, I slowed to a walk, I almost just walked right off the coarse desperate to just get out and get away. I was starting to cry from just the bald *relief* of it. it was *over*. then I remembered my medal and was sure to get that THEN get out and get away.

# Post-race

we went to the aquarium! I was worried about my foot. my inner ankle / inner arch was beginning to pain. I thought ""great. its going to lock up again. I'll be hosting thanksgiving with a severe limp listening to my step mother in law expound upon me (in between loud slurps of montepulciano) how bad running is for me."" but luckily it did not. it was sore, I favored it slightly but equal parts because of my tendon but also because the blisters just hurt. It got no worse the next day.  I had decided it would be wise and space efficient to just pack my other pair of brooks adrenalines to wear around town and I cannot express how bitterly I regretted that sliding my blistered swollen feet into just the exact same shoe 😭. I should have brought my birkenstocks and fuck the haters. we went out to dinner that night to a steak house and man I put a spare pair of leggings on under my jeans. like no way was I going to put *denim* on those thighs.

Now (monday) I'm back home. I'm sore but my foot feels great. it really must have been autoimmune related to have come (mostly) out of no where but then also to go back to no where so fast. the body is a weird thing. I can now wear jeans again.",2,1764015606.0,XXRunning,0,1.0,False

got my shirt

""Made in Bangladesh""

In some sweatshop.

I went downstairs

And kissed my girly.

Ain't no bird in sight—

Where's the snow?

I guess I ain't seen a deer—

Been a few years.

But I was feeling cold

'Cause the AC's always on.

I put the hot coffee on—

""Nescafe"" is the brand we drink.

I just took my cup 

And drank my blood coffee.

And I opened my phone,

Read about children

Dying in Gaza and Sudan.

Then I checked my mail,

""93 unread"" — my inbox said.

Zero when I went to bed.

They work me like a rat,

Wish I could take a bat to

Their head.

But, I need the peanuts they pay me in.

Got in my car.

Made in the U.S.A.

By an immigrant—

Who'll lynch you,

If you ain't white.

I put on a podcast,

Anything to take my mind.

since the last time he talked

'Bout some judgement day.

Ain't no hell or heaven,

On the way to work

I saw protestors,

With their big signs and torches

I never could keep up.

They think we stand a chance

But we are all slaves

To corporate greed.

And do what I'm told—

Don't know if my heart exists,

My body's gone cold.

But I do matter

'Cause the state's always watching me.

I’m a guy in mid 20’s, i stay in chandigarh for weekdays for work (i do day trading). I go back home on weekends.
So here’s the thing, i dont have any female friends in chandigarh. I like to meet some local or new people to explore the city, hang out, check out cafes. I feel lil lonely when i dont have anyone to talk with outside work. 
I like to do paintings, walking around the city, try out food

If you know any local meetup groups, hobby groups, or if you’re someone who’d like to hang out (even just for a coffee or exploring Chandigarh), I’d be super happy to connect. I’m totally fine meeting in public places, and open to whatever feels comfortable..

Thanks for reading hope to make some friends here

1p5ru1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/1p5ru1k/coffee_shop_recs_to_sit_and_chat_for_an_extended/,Coffee Shop Recs to Sit and Chat for an Extended Period?,"tl:dr: considering updating the location for my weekly Sunday coffee date with a friend, so I'm asking for places we haven't visited yet we might try, ideally not too far from Logan or West Central, open by 9AM on a Sunday, and has ample seating or low traffic so we can sit for an hour give or take without being rushed.



I currently do coffee weekly with a friend on Sunday mornings, we usually hit First Ave downtown, but after Deb's passing and the resulting ownership change it hasn't been quite the same - understaffed often enough to be concerning, and the quality and selection of baked goods isn't consistent as it once was, but at the same time after shopping around it's proving hard to beat because the coffee is always quite good, there's a lot of seating so we can safely chat as long as we like, it's simply a nice space, and parking is easy enough given the time of day despite being downtown. Places I've tried that didn't quite do it for me, admitting that I am being a little bit of a Goldilocks here since we have a place that, while isn't what it used to be, has set a very high bar in the past:

* We've tried Arctos a couple times, but the seating seemed to be at a premium and it felt we might be taking up needed space, on more than one visit the Barista working that day seemed oddly brusque, although I don't know if it was just bad mornings or if that's usual there. (to be clear, I don't have or agree with the opinion service employees need be chipper, but would prefer they don't come off as hostile)
* The Ladder location by the Browne's is pleasant and would be a contender on cozy/quiet points alone, but once I learned about the owner it's hard to patronize any Ladder location without feeling dirty about where my money is ending up
* The Indaba on Broadway had their tip scale set all the way up at 30%, and I just absolutely hate that practice, it's early for me, I don't want to have to go out of my way just to avoid extortionate tipping practice. (regardless of the tip setting, the overall experience was average) Do the other Indaba locations do that?
* Little Garden Cafe (Audubon) - this might be worth revisiting, as I have no strong memories of how it went when we last visited, except that the location is on the edge of where I'd like and results in a lot of retreading ground for me as the defacto driver. (I do not recommend the newer Logan location that is in the old Ultimate Bagel location, it was aggressively mediocre, and while I'm still getting adjusted to how expensive everything feels now, it was not priced accordingly)
* Clark's Fork - They do coffee, but it's not their primary gig and I think that makes it not ideal for my friend who likes her complicated coffee orders. I do love Clark's though and want to recommend for breakfast/lunch, they are quite affordable, the food is always good, and the owner is lovely (which is a mixed bag, I appreciate her dedication but I'm not the most affable person and her frequent small talk can leave me nodding along for longer than I'd like, thankfully I usually have a friend to run interference)

I think that's it for what we've tried so far, I've been alternating weeks between familiarity of First Ave and something new. Let me know if you have a joint you think we should try, or even if not great for our time/area, any places in town you'd recommend and want to see succeed.",15,1764015336.0,Spokane,24,1.0,False
