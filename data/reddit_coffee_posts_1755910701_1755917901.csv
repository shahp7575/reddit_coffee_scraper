**Chapter 1: After Years…**

On a deep winter night, Demarro Chikauak rose from bed, panting heavily. His obsidian-black eyes opened wide.  
—That stupid dream again —he exclaimed.

Although the clock marked 3 p.m., the moon still ruled the night. Demarro stood up and headed to the kitchen. He poured water into the old French press and added plenty of freshly ground coffee. The atmosphere felt empty as he waited; the minutes weighed like hours.

When the coffee maker finished its work, he served himself a cup, spilling some coffee on the table. —Damn it— he whispered through clenched teeth, and with frustration grabbed a rag and cleaned up the mess he had made. Holding the cup, he went to his desk and turned on the computer and the room’s monitors. The blue light illuminated his golden face, showing desperation and, above all, exhaustion.

He took a sip of the coffee—bitter and strong, the only way to stay awake at that hour. That was how he had lived ever since that moment, years ago.

Fatigue overcame him, and he fell asleep. Then, a memory invaded him. A dark figure, with purple hues, stretched across ruined buildings and vast flames burning as if hell itself had risen.

—So you’re Demarro, huh? —said the figure. —Finally, the Gods’ chosen meet face to face.  
The figure laughed mockingly and continued arrogantly:  
—I am Kai. I will find the sword, and with it, I will destroy this rotten universe to create a perfect one.

Demarro awoke from the memory suddenly, returning to the present and remembering his goal.  
—I will find the sword before him —he said with determination. He set out once again to try locating one of the pieces. Despite years of searching with no clues, he remained tenacious, his eyes fixed on the goal.

After what felt like only minutes to him, the sun rose, and his secretary, Charlotte, opened the door.  
—Awake again, sir? I told you, you need to sleep! —  
Reluctantly, Demarro left his work and turned to her.  
—Yes, yes, sorry Charlie —he said irritably.  
The blonde rolled her eyes and sighed.  
—You’re a lost cause —she said exasperatedly—. Anyway, remember you have breakfast today with the Prime Minister of Pacifica, Seo-jun.

Demarro put his hands on his face.  
—Damn, I forgot —he exclaimed tiredly.  
—You and your lousy memory. Well, it’s at 9 at the Esmeralda restaurant. Don’t be late. —said Charlotte before leaving.

Demarro stood up and went to his room to get dressed. After half an hour, he came out in his tailored suit, went downstairs, and got into his car, heading to the restaurant.

During the drive, an extreme migraine struck him due to his prolonged lack of rest. He closed his eyes for a moment to relax and, in the dimness, he saw a chair… or maybe a throne. It wasn’t very clear, but he noticed a strong reddish color on the object.

He opened his eyes again and suddenly slammed on the brakes, nearly running over some pedestrians.  
—Damn it! —he shouted loudly—. Charlie’s right, I need to rest more often.  
He pulled some headache pills from the glove compartment and swallowed them.

After a few more minutes of driving, he arrived at the restaurant, where the minister was already waiting.  
—Good morning, Mr. Demarro —he said upon seeing him enter.  
—Yes, good morning, Mr. Prime Minister —Demarro replied before sitting at the assigned table.

The two figures conversed and ordered their food. Demarro could only think about how boring the situation was and how much he wanted to go home. His attitude made it obvious, which unsettled the minister, though he didn’t dare say anything.

When his food arrived, the black-haired man devoured it, provoking a reaction of disapproval from Seo-jun. But Demarro didn’t care.

Once they finished eating, they proceeded to close and sign agreements, the actual purpose of the meeting. Without leaving room for further conversation, Demarro coldly concluded:  
—Well, Mr. Minister, it was a pleasure making agreements with you, but I must go now. —

Relieved that the uncomfortable situation had ended, he sighed and quickly got into his car to return home.

Once home, he pretended not to hear his secretary speaking to him. After evading her, he went down to his workshop and used his high-tech prosthetic right arm to adjust a Tesla coil, which he used to distract himself a little before working again.

Like a curious child, he brought different objects close to see what would happen.

First, he brought a screw: nothing happened.  
Then, a small battery: the lamp connected to the coil gave a faint flash.  
Finally, a car battery…  
Boom! The lamp exploded, covering his face in black dust.  
—That hurt a bit, but I expected it —he said, laughing.

Drifting for a moment, he wondered curiously:  
—What would happen if I brought one of those cursed sword fragments that drive me mad?

His eyes opened wide as if he had a revelation:  
—Those fragments have too much power! They leave an energy trace greater than a nuclear reactor, maybe even more than a fusion one… —

Then he reflected with disappointment:  
—Impossible. I would need a metal with 100 times the conductivity of copper. —

The vision of the reddish throne returned to his mind. He tried to recall it carefully. Finally, he understood:  
—That’s it! —he took a breath and prepared as if he had an audience before him.  
—Long ago, an ancient civilization was struck by a meteor composed of a crimson-colored metal, from which they crafted a beautiful throne. The metals with the highest conductivity, coincidentally, are not gray: they are gold and copper. —

He quickly returned to his computer and, as if chased, began searching for information about the metal. He opened tabs nonstop, typed feverishly, read articles and pages far too quickly.

After half an hour of searching without pause, he reached a conclusion.  
—Eureka! —he shouted with excitement.

His secretary ran in, thinking it was an emergency.  
—What’s happening?! —Charlotte yelled as she entered.  
Demarro turned the computer screen toward her.  
—Its name is Ruprum, a metal with 100 times the conductivity of copper. I just have to get the throne, and that’s it!  
—Uh… I don’t know what you’re talking about, but it says here that throne is in the province of Libya —said Charlotte, very confused.

Demarro turned and read the paragraph mentioning its location. He opened his mouth and squinted an eye in extreme exasperation.  
—Damn… You’re right —he sighed, but his eyes lit up—. No matter, then I’ll infiltrate and steal the throne!

His secretary facepalmed, covering her eyes, as if to say: “The idiot is going to do something stupid.”  
—S-sir, are you sure you want to do something so risky? —she said, trying to convince him NOT to.  
—Of course! Call the European commander and tell him I want a meeting in Malta. Also, book me a trip there right now. —

Reluctantly, the blonde agreed and, with no choice, did as Demarro ordered.  
—I’ll get the metal, no matter the cost! —he exclaimed with excitement once his secretary left the room—. Because after years… the odyssey finally begins.",1,1755917802.0,writers,2,1.0,False

So I bought my PS Portal a couple of days ago and the first day it worked great! I played it in my room with my PS5 and it worked perfectly. 

That same night, I went over to my girlfriends place and it didn't work. I put my PS5 on rest mode, connected it to wifi and did everything that you're supposed to do. Still nothing. Today, we went to a coffee shop and I connected it to the wifi, and boom! It worked.

TLDR: I live in an apartment complex that has their own router. I can't do any of the fancy router porting or whatnot. I wanted to ask: if I connected my PS5 to an ethernet cable and leave it on rest mode, can I still connect my PS Portal as long as I am connected to the wifi? My PS5 is connected via ethernet to an ethernet port/outlet or whatever it is that you connect it to the wall.

We both knew there was something there. It didn't feel casual or like a crush. 

I'd gone away for school due to my mom's addiction and not wanting to stay home (which he didn't know was the reason) and he stayed local. One night over winter break he finally asked me out, asked me if I heard that weird noise outside and then immediately said he would like to get coffee together. It was the first thing he ever said to me in years.

I wanted to say yes so badly and told him I would love to but here's why I don't think I can make it work right now: 12 hour round trips from school, no car, no transit between school and home, I relied on my dad to pick me up, rarely got to come home due to working on campus and couldn't come back for the summers. I didn't tell him that on top of that home was unsafe because my mom was addicted. He said no worries, but I felt that night was heavy for both of us. But I was trying to protect him from my home life and from what I felt like I couldn't give him being so far away.

It took 10 years for things at home to be safe and stable, I'm moving back for the first time ever now that safety isn't an issue anymore, and I still want to know him. I never stopped wanting him or really moved on from him.

1mxq54x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mxq54x/my_girlfriends_dog_has_ruined_our_relationship/,My girlfriend’s dog has ruined our relationship.,"“Hey, can I ask you something?”

I took a deep breath and set the knife down. “Can we do this later? I haven’t eaten all day.” 

My girlfriend, Vanessa, was glaring at me. Her foot tapped against the floor, and I could see she was trying her best not to lash out. As if he sensed the tension growing in the room, that damn dog of hers lumbered into the kitchen.

“Fine,” she said. “I just want to know why you couldn’t feed Harry? I know you’re busy but come on Eli. He was *starving*.”

I rubbed the bridge of my nose and looked away. “Alright alright. Sorry. I got called into work and forgot.” I tried to smile but it came off as more of a spasm of my lips. “I’ll buy him a bone or something to make up for it.” 

Vanessa grabbed Harry’s leash. “This isn’t the first time though.” Little tears dripped down her face onto the floor. Harry whined and nuzzled his wide head against her shoulder. “He means a lot to me. Taking care of him is taking care of me…okay?” 

I clenched my jaw so tight it felt like my teeth might crack. “You got it,” I said. 

After I heard the door close I waited a few minutes before finally allowing myself to relax. I finished cutting up my chicken patty then threw the cubes onto a bed of white rice. I thought, did she really not make anything for dinner because I didn’t feed Harry? I shook my head and walked into the living room. 

I tried to lose myself in a true crime documentary about some people that went missing at a carnival a few decades ago, but I kept looking at the pictures scattered across the room instead. Pictures of Vanessa and her deceased husband, Oscar. 

I knew it shouldn’t bother me that she kept those pictures. We had only been together for two years after all, whereas she and Oscar had been high school sweethearts who married shortly after graduation and were together for nearly twelve years. 

It hurt though. It was obvious she still loved him. The fucking dog was proof of that. Apparently he had been a gift to her from Oscar on his death bed. A ‘living’ testament to their love. 

I snorted and opened another can of beer. The so-called ‘testament to their love’ dug holes in the backyard every other day which I had to fix, shit on the floors, and chewed up my best pair of dress shoes. 

Believe it or not that was not the worst of it. No. Not by far. The dog behaved like a spiteful step-son. He would put himself between Vanessa and I at night, which she found hilarious. He would scratch and howl at the door whenever we shut it to make love. One time, he even jumped onto me, leaving muddy paw prints all over my dress shirt right before we were going to leave for Valentine’s Day dinner. The ensuing argument which resulted after I cuffed him across the head left me crashing at my brother’s house for a week and Vanessa and I nearly splitting.

Thankfully we didn’t. She was a cool gal and I really did not want to go back to living in an apartment on the south side. I never thought I would live in a house as nice as this one and some dog wasn’t going to push me out that easily. 

I laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. I wasn’t even second place in my girlfriend’s life. I was third.

I drifted off into an irritable state that was half sleep and half dim awareness. Faintly, as if from far away, I heard Vanessa scolding me. Closer, ever closer, I felt something thick and wet move back and forth between my fingers. I snapped awake, my heart pounding. I was alone and the TV was off. A nightmare. It was a nightmare. 

Vanessa was asleep in our bed with the dog laying next to her in my spot. He looked up at me and growled softly as I entered the room. “Make room Harry,” Vanessa grumbled. The dog took his sweet ass time to lay down on his doggy bed at our feet. 

The next morning found Vanessa and I going out for some breakfast sandwiches at one of our favorite spots. After some begging and a promise to go shopping with her at Marshall’s later she agreed to leave her dog at home. 

We people-watched and ate and talked about work place drama. I’m a cook and she’s a nurse, so we have *a lot* of material to discuss. Looking back, it was one of the better dates we have had in a long while. No planning went into it. It just happened that way. 

Funny how that works. 

Vanessa crumpled up the sandwich wrapper and sighed. “Ugh, if only these things weren’t eight hundred calories.” 

I snorted. “You’ll be fine.” I patted my belly, which had acquired some extra padding within the last few months. “I should probably lay off the extra calories though.” 

She raised a pencil-thin eyebrow. “You could lay off the beers you know…or at least come out with Harry and I on our runs.” 

“Wouldn’t want to get between you two,” I said glumly. 

Vanessa pursed her lips. 

Oops. 

She leaned forward, her hands folded beneath her chin. “It’s been half a year since you moved in, and you two still haven’t grown on one another. What’s going on?” 

I crossed my arms. “I don’t know…I feel like he hates me because I am not…” 

She rolled her eyes. “Harry is a dog. Let me say it again. He. Is. A. Dog. He doesn’t hate you. But he can sense that you don’t like *him*. That is why I am asking you what’s going on.”

“Nessa he ate my shoes. The ones that belonged to my dad. Somehow singled them out from all the others, like he knew how special they were to me. He gets mad whenever I try to lay down in *our bed*. He —“ 

She waved her hand. “Are you hearing yourself Eli? You’re taking the actions of a *dog* personal. I’m worried about you. Ever since you moved in you started drinking more…you don’t work out like you used to…I am sorry but you are losing yourself.” She reached for my hands, her tone earnest as she took them in her own. “I don’t know if it’s the stress from living in a new space or something at work…” 

Something in me snapped. I yanked my hands away from hers and stood up. “IT IS YOUR FUCKING DOG,” I shouted. I regretted it almost instantly. 

Vanessa leaned back, her eyes wide. The workers stopped what they were doing and looked our way. 
I slowly took my seat, and together we sat there for a bit, not knowing where to take things. An older man walked over and looked at us both. “Ma’am, is everything alright?” he asked. 

A terrible calm settled over her. She slowly picked up the car keys then smiled at the old man. “Yeah, I am okay. Thanks.” 

I tried to talk to her on the way back home, but she was silent. The dog greeted her enthusiastically at the door and growled at me. I briefly entertained a fantasy of kicking him in the side, but let it pass just as quickly. 

She didn’t speak to me much over the next couple of days. I didn’t bother trying to sleep in our room — the living room was my new space. It wasn’t half that bad, had it not been for the reoccurring nightmares it would have been perfect. 

Work kept us on different schedules for the rest of the week, and when Friday came along Vanessa told me she had made last minute plans to go on a weekend trip with some of her girlfriends. I tried to give her a hug bye but she brushed me off. She told me we would talk once she was back, and to make sure I fed and walked her dog. I nodded. 

I watched as she got in the car. My heart sank when I noticed one of her male co-workers was driving. 

I grabbed the dog’s bowl and went into the garage. I scooped up some kibble from the big yellow bag and mixed it together with some leftover beef stew I made. I hoped it would count as some sort of attempt at building a relationship with the dog. 

Maybe Vanessa was right. Harry probably sensed my anger towards him, towards Vanessa. He was only being protective of his owner. I gathered up beer cans from around the house and threw them in the bin outside, feeling pretty down on myself. I had let my jealously get the best of me. Took it out on a poor dog. 

Now I was probably going to lose my girl because of it. 

When I got inside, I saw Harry finishing up the last of his meal. He had licked the bowl clean. “How’d you like it?” I asked. 

He looked up at me and cocked his head. I saw his tail start to wag. “I can make you more if you liked the taste of that.” I shifted from side to side, feeling ashamed. “I owe you more than a few meals.” 

Harry barked. He nudged the bowl with his paw, then barked again. I laughed and held up my hands. “Alright alright. I’ll make some beef stew for us both tonight. But I need to run to the store. Think you can hold down the fort while I’m gone?” 

I went to the local supermarket and strategized how I was going to make things right with Vanessa while I gathered ingredients for dinner. I had some pretty good ideas while there, and when I pulled into the driveway of our home, I realized that it had been some time since I had felt this at ease. 

I whistled, bags of groceries in hand, while walking up to the door. I noticed Harry watching me through a window. He barked and started scratching at the glass. “Hold on, I’m coming,” I said.

I stepped inside and nearly dropped the groceries. “Oh fuck. The HELL YOU STUPID FUCKING —“ 

All one hundred and fifty pounds of Harry crashed into me. I didn’t even have time to yell. Together we landed on the coffee table. It collapsed sending wood and glass all over the carpet. Harry licked me across the face and barked happily. I stared up at him in disbelief. 

He jumped off of me. I breathed in deep lungfuls of air, laying there until I was able to get back up again. 
Outside of some cuts on my arm from the glass, I seemed to be fine. “Harry! Harry!” I shouted. 

I couldn’t find him anywhere in the house. I yanked at my hair and tried to calm myself, then I took a picture of what he had done and sent it to Vanessa. 

In the foyer, laid out perfectly for me to see, was a blanket I had gifted Vanessa last Christmas. It had a collage of some of our happiest moments printed on it. Harry had ripped into it and left a nice pile of crap on top. 

When Vanessa called me, she was in disbelief. She asked if I was sure Harry did it. Did I lock all of the doors before leaving? Was someone playing a prank? 

I nearly hung up on her then and there. Did she think he was some kind of perfect being incapable of making a mistake? Then she asked if I was angry enough at her to do something like that. Which in return I suggested she couldn’t accept her dog was a dick because he was a gift from her dead husband. 

Well that did it. She said we would be going to couple’s therapy and if I didn’t want to I would need to pack my bags and be out of there before she came home. Feeling defeated, I agreed. Then she hung up. 

I made dinner for one and felt some satisfaction at Harry’s cries for my food. I kept him outside that night and didn’t bother refilling his bowl. Knowing that my relationship was probably done for I leaned back in my chair, flipped Harry off, and turned on the TV. 

It was the best night of sleep I had in a while. I dreamt of Vanessa, back when we first got together. Back when she was full of passion for me, and we would lay together for hours. She kissed me passionately, her long hair tickling my mouth, and for a moment it felt as if we were hanging together in space, the only two souls throughout all that cold dark. 

Cold. 

I woke up to the cold. 

The window was wide open. 

I blinked back my fatigue, and saw the first traces of dawn in the sky. I looked out onto the yard, and saw Harry lying motionless. At first I thought he was fine, but when his sides failed to rise, I knew something was wrong. 

“Oh shit. SHIT,” I hissed. I stumbled towards the back door and went outside. I knelt next to him, trying to ignore the wave of emotion that threatened to drown me. I ran my hands along his curly coat, feeling for a pulse or breath or any sign of life. “Harry. Come on Harry. Don’t do this buddy.”

I felt his head and his side. Opened his mouth to check if he swallowed something. My hand stopped at his belly. My stomach sank. Some bit of metal was lodged there. My eyes widened. Did he fall on something? Did someone stab him? 

“Fuck,” I whispered. I went to grab my phone and started to call the vet while I tried to pull aside the curls to better see the metal stuck in his gut. 

My finger and thumb closed around the flat piece of metal. The veterinarian’s assistant answered, but I couldn’t have spoken even if my life depended on it. I was frozen. Every part of me rigid with fear. 

Harry slowly turned his head and stared at me. “Pull the zipper Elijah,” he said quietly. 

A choke? A cry? Some sort of twisted, primal groan of terror forced itself out of me. I willed myself to move faster but I couldn’t. I crawled backwards on my hands and feet, not even able to stand. 

All the while Harry watched me. 

Since then I have been staying at my brother’s. Vanessa has called me multiple times but I have not answered and have not read her texts either. I am too afraid. All of my things are still at her house and I know I can’t avoid this forever. 

I am stuck between two outcomes of going back. Either finding out I have gone insane and hallucinated a talking…thing wearing a dog suit OR. 

Or. 

I don’t even want to write it out. 

If any of you have any suggestions then please, let me know. Take away my accountability.

Hi I am a 32 years old; that feels weird to say, but I guess that is what early year birthdays do. I am from the Waterloo region, though I am open to driving to meet up with people if that is the case.  I am 5'10/5'11 I honestly don't know what one is correct. I have brown hair, usually short/buzzed as I can't be bothered to fix my messy bed hair in the morning for work. Have a mustache atm as work would not let me keep my goatee. I will say I am over weight; working on it, lost control of it after loosing 80 lbs years ago. Currently in the 250 range, though down nearly 20lbs on the year already. You really can't out work a horrible diet.. I tried.

I work both days and nights, though do get a decent amount of days off for my weekends ( 4 on 5 off); so my schedule is really all over the place. It dose not stop me from responding as quickly as I can; as I am the type that hates having notifications on my phone. lol.  I don't feel comfortable saying what I do in a post, as it is forward facing; though if we do connect I will absolutely say what I do.

Outside of work I mainly stay in; though I am working on being more extrovert on my days off. You can find me at the gym, playing video games or chores/ meal prepping for the next couple days. For video games I pretty much play anything, especially if it's with a group of friends. 

I am looking for a long term relationship, though if it only ends up in a friendship later I am good with that. I am the type that will gladly drive and bring you coffee to your work if you want/need to. I am also probably a little addicted to coffee. I would like someone to be at the same point in life, that being ready/looking to settle down. Age range would be 28-34, but I am open to anyone as long as our goals and ideal for a relationship is inline with each other.

She’s always been like that, but with time it was turning worse and worse. She has an apartment with 3 rooms in total, where she used to live with her elderly parents and my mom. And, for some period of time, also with my dad and baby/toddler/preschooler me (and a cat). This apartment always was a bit cramped (according to my earliest conscious memories), but it’s understandable, when you are trying to fit so many people in such small place. And she had a lot of pot plants. Whole windowsill and some stand, probably a TV stand without TV, and few pots on a furniture around. I thought it was really cool, none of my friends had this much, and TV stand had really pretty crocheted doily. It all was very neat and cute.

But when I grew up a little bit, and economical situation became better, with a help of all grandparents, my parents and I moved to their own apartment. I’m not sure when exactly things started to get worse, I visited them oftenly, and stayed with them for week or more during summer school break, because my best friend and other friends lived nearby, but I wasn’t looking around much. Big dining table always was covered with some things, but she was always cleaning it for all celebrations, so all family could sit there. Plants invaded another windowsill and desk near it. Great-grandparents’s health was slowly getting worse, as they reached their 80s. They both had strokes, grandma’s was a minor one, but grandpa’s affected his coordination and speech (but, luckly, not his clear thinking).

Than great-grandpa died. One room left empty. Still with his books, which he was reading till his last day. Great-grandma’s health was getting worse, she had severe diabetes and developing dementia. Probably somewhere around here it started to get out of control. Grandpa’s room started to store her clothing, craft supplies and unfinished projects. Plants were spreading over surfaces – now unused desk, bookshelves around it, their favorite armchair in front of TV got covered by some craft stuff too. She was earning enough, so she was free to buy herself clothes and shoes, cool plants (she got into desert roses and orchids), yarn etc. A small shelf with a plant lamp for baby plants spawned in the kitchen. I was still trying to visit and spend as much time as I could with great-grandma, but I was mostly sitting with her at the kitchen and wasn’t looking around. We still gathered there for all celebrations, sat at same dining table.

Than great-grandma died. Grandma was left alone in her apartment, only with us visiting, and her younger sister with her son occasionally staying for a week or so. They live in a different city, pretty far away, and, in case, they were also visiting before, but rarely stayed for long time because of inconvenience. I guess at this point everything started to go off rails. We moved our celebrations to my parent’s apartment.

But two years later, the worst thing happened – my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and 1.5 years later she passed away. My dad was trying to bury himself in work, but completely lost himself to alcohol, and one year after mom’s death, I moved in with grandma and that’s where actual story starts.

At that moment, I still lived in my childhood memories of this place, so when I arrived, I was… a bit shocked. All furniture was where it’s used to be, but… Grandpa’s bed was completely buried by some boxes, bags and whatever else. Some insane amount of cooking/knitting/plants magazines were equally spread over at least two rooms. She got a coffee table and at least four ikea shelves, all covered with plants, soil and insane amount of dust. Clothes was everywhere. Wardrobe that my parents used was simply bulked with something something till the middle! Dining table was not only buried with magazines and some craft stuff, it was completely blocked from two sides. I don’t know with what. Big paper and plastic bags with something. She got three new tvs, bigger one was on top of old one, and she planned to put one at kitchen, and another at great-grandaprents room for great-grandma, but never did. Empty space where my bed used to be was also covered with something. Smallest room just had a narrow passage to the window with plants. And plants were everywhere. Remember I said she got coffee table? She clearly planned to sit in armchair, watch TV and drink coffee with croissant, but armchair was completely covered with stuff and coffee table covered in plants and plant stuff.

Now add a highschooler me with my pc, clothes and other stuff. There was literally no place for me in this mess. Back then, I didn’t know anything about hoarding, and messed up. I thought I can just help her to clean up and everything will be good.

I manage to persuade her to get rid of some useless women’s magazines (not cooking/crafting, only those with celeb gossips and fashion trends and dietary advises), throw away not good bed, put another on it’s place and make free a lot of space. Which eventually got buried. With something. Idk what. I’ve managed to salvage some space for myself, but it’s not even close to enough. Usually I just live around my desk and don’t look anywhere else, because it is too depressing.

But my biggest fuckup was when I thought that if I create a mess too big to be ignored, she will get angry and clean it up, but it still lies where I put it, but under huge amount of I don’t know what. I don’t go to that room anymore.

Everything got even more messy, when my father finally drank himself to death. We had to move a lot of my parent’s things, while we were renting apartment. And even worse, when we sold it and I had to grab whatever I want to keep for myself. (Now when one enters our apartment, they got greeted by a fucking fridge, lmao, because there is no other place for it, and even more funny, a small table, which initially used to stand blocking passage almost completely, now It’s a bit better). And all corridors are now just narrow passages with boxes of books.

And apartment has some problems. Main one is pipes. Kitchen sink is bad, and bathroom was bad too, but I just called a plumber for that. But kitchen is a big problem, you can’t just change water tap, you also need to change sink. But you can’t just change sink, you also have to change pipes. And she doesn’t want. Idk why. Modern plastic pipes are not good enough, or smth. And everything is dusty, because amount of dusty surfaces here exceeds possible to keep clean.

Just a couple more examples, that come to my mind. Before small room was completely dead, I went there to grab a bottle of wine for some celebration (we don’t drink much, and usually buy it at local wine fair for a whole year ahead) and saw a shoebox from familiar brand, I opened it and found brand new ankleboots, and I had shoes from same collection! Like, 10 years ago! Said she planned to wear it with something, but never did. For a couple first years, she tried to free some space on dinner table for celebrations, but not a whole table. But now we celebrate everything just at kitchen table. Which also has some cozy charm. And we don’t store our year stock of alcohol in a neat shelf, it’s just gathering dust under kitchen table. Last winter I whined that I need new jeans (no implications, just don’t like shopping), and she just brought me 4 pairs, 3 with tags, like magician with bottomless hat. Said she hoped she will lose some weight.

And I guess I understand why she is a hoarder. Once, shortly after I moved in, I was trying to persuade her to get rid of dried roses, that stands on cupboard, because they are incredibly dusty and she has allergy, but she said something like “You don’t understand. I don't get roses anymore. And these are from the times I was given roses.” And she lost a lot of people. Her younger brother died young. Grandpa died less than 10 years after their wedding. Great-grands. And mom. Things are keeping memories of better times. I came to terms with her. Accepted that I will clean this whole mess only after her death. She is an immovable object, and I’m just counting days til I leave. And I don’t think I can help her. She is unironically a boomer, and she refuses to admit she has a problem. And probably not very good with expressing her emotions. I love her, and she did a lot for me, but I don’t think I can help her.

And living like that is hard. I’m drowning in my own mess, because I don’t have space to store my own things. Looking around is depressing, so I’m no better than she, we both just don’t look around. I live only inside of my pc.

We sold my parent’s apartment last year (50/50 with my half-brother) and grandma said she will help me to buy my own apartment, and searching for apartment with her was it’s own kind of hell, but somehow we made it two weeks ago. Yay! Or not. We’ve bought an apartment nearby, with furniture from previous owner.

So, now to the point. My initial plan was to change wire, repair (sorry I think google translate is not giving me correct word) hardwood floor and move in asap with as much necessities as I can afford. But today (which turned into yesterday while I was writing) we had an argument. I said I want to throw majority of old furniture and she got… offended? Hurt?

And, there are two things about her I absolutely hate, I’m trying to restrain myself, but, honestly, every time she’s doing that I start to see red. First is when she says “I need to think about that”, which means that whatever it is – it will never be done, no matter how big or small it is. And second is that when I ask her a question, and she don’t like the answer, she just keep silent, like as if I didn’t ask anything.

And she did second one a lot during this argument (and I saw a lot of red). She already started this operation few days ago with “you know, I checked that sofa and bed, sofa is fine and bed has still good spring cushions (sorry, I’m completely relaying on google translate with tis one). Ok, her sofa is a horrendous mess where no person should sit, I was trying to persuade her to do something with it for years. Let her keep whatever she wants. And I’m low-key interested in vintage furniture, and I think majority of what’s in this apartment isn’t good at all. I’m 100% keeping armchairs and coffee table, they are good, wall unit is fine, so-so, though I don’t need it, but the rest is just below average chipboard. Sidetables already falling apart, two giant wardrobes are barely holding, and dressing table of discord is keeping up only because it, most likely, was rarely used.

Two best highlights of argument:

“You want to throw away wall unit just because you don’t need it???” (I think it offended her most)

“You said you want a custom desk; why don’t you use wardrobe door for it?”

What can I do with it? I want to move and I need to clean apartment for renovation, both walls and floor, but now she wants not only her stuff, but this one too, and I’m so fucking tired of it! I lived in her debris, I don’t want to live in someone else’s, I want to live my own life!

Also, I really want to persuade her to let me take dressing table and secretary desk from our apartment, but she won’t. Not because she need it or use it (she don’t), not because she don’t want to give it to me, but because taking them away requires raking her mountains of stuff and that’s nearly impossible.

What do you think, do I have any chances achieving that goals? How should I approach her?",1,1755917279.0,hoarding,1,1.0,False

Hello! I (F,25) started working for FedEx Office in 2023. I got along with 4 out of the 5 employees we have at our office. One of them, Gabby (F,26), is the one I’ve always seemed to bump heads with but otherwise the others. One thing I did notice, after a month of me being there is one individual Dyllan (M, 50s?) would make sexual jokes, either about female customers, to the team members and the manager and team members relatives. As a new person, I didn’t say much because I am very much a follower and push over so I didn’t want to say anything that would make them think that I am a problem. However, as the year went by, the jokes got worse. It went from telling us that women with great bodies deserve to have services at FedEx for free, saying women who show skin are asking to be sexually assaulted, and even touching the women in the team. I have brought this up with Shawna (my manager F,40s?) eventually as I was no longer new, but she would brush it as “He’s been like that for years” and at times would say “She’s talked to him before” and “Nobody is perfect”. There was one time when he didn’t help me close and would make sexual jokes and I turned to Shawna and asked to not work alone with him like that again. To which Shawna responded that she couldn’t fulfill that request as we are a small office and she needs people to go where they need to. 
One thing to note as well is within the year, Gabby and my relationship got better and we were communicating healthy. 
Turn to 2025 and it seemed Dyllan still never changed. He continued with his sexual jokes, gestures, comments, and contact. My breaking point to turn to HR was when Dyllan asked me if he could ask Gabby, that in order for him to switch his switch with hers (per her request), she would have to do sexual favors for him. I felt uncomfortable as it was only me and him so I awkwardly laughed to tell him no he cannot make that request. He asked me again and this time trying to change the conversation I told him to ask her to bring Starbucks to him. Instead was left with the response “I deserve a lot more than coffee”. At that point I was sick and tired of reporting to my manager and started on my letter to HR. I emailed HR my letter and spoke to Shawna the next day about what had happened. Again, I was left with another disappointing answer. She told me that Dyllan is a “good person” even if he makes “bad comments” . She tried to give me reasons to justify how he’s a “good person” but I personally didn’t want to hear it . She then proceeded to say that he’s been like this for years and that she’s working on this issue with him. I personally, felt like that conversation went nowhere. Shawna left it at “agree to disagree” about Dylan’s person. After, HR got involved (which is confidential on who placed the complaint), Dyllan was ultimately removed from our store and placed in another store…. At the same position (Lead consultant)… with the same pay… Someone who did illegal actions was transferred… whatever he’s someone else’s problem. After that, I noticed that my relationship with Gabby shifted. I also noticed a weird vibe in the workplace. Like no one liked me. I tried not to overthink because I knew it was confidential and it was just me getting in my head. But my thoughts were confirmed when I would ask Gabby for help and she would blatantly ignore me. At that point. I was fed up, and put my voice memo on my phone and set it in the back of the store (there are no rooms just the whole area and a bathroom). And in that recording I heard Shawna telling Gabby about the HR case, talking to her about me, and Gabby calling me a bitch. And considering how close Gabby and Shawna are, I KNEW that if she’s telling Gabby about the HR case, it explained why Gabby started being rude to me again. I then heard Shawna JOKING about me and the case to Gabby and Leslie (F, 50s?). I talked to Shawna (playing dumb) and talked to her about the way Gabby was treating me and I didn’t know why. Shawna then told me it’s because of my attendance and that it’s “gabby being gabby”. Mind you, Gabby is a lead consultant as well. Shawna then went on vacation for a week, and while she was on vacation, and altercation had broken out with Gabby and I. I was working on the computer for a print order, Gabby was helping a customer and she came up to me and accused me of taking her computer intentionally . I told her I didn’t and I was using for a print job really question because that was the only computer I could print a label from. She continued standing there antagonizing me. I got fed up and was getting ready to walk to the back to grab my items, only for Gabby to walk to the back and start texting on her phone. And that pissed me off because she started all that with me just to go on her phone? So I turned around and told her she was acting like a bitch. And I know per the policy calling someone a bitch is considered “workplace violence” but I was fed up from talking to Shawna and her being negligent…. AGAIN and the way gabby was treating me just to go to the back on her phone . Go back today and I got written up for calling Gabby a bitch and Gabby gets a victim card (Shawna said that Gabby feels disrespected and constantly babies her for me calling her a bitch). Now I’m fed up and I want to make this case Legal. As I feel like FedEx hasn’t done their job to keep their employees safe. 


TLDR; workplace sexual harassment was reported retaliation was followed only for me to get written up, what do I do? Who do I contact?

In total, I’ve only experienced true flow 3 times in my life, 2 of them while sim racing.

The best one was when I was trying to beat a lap record. I did some warm-up laps to set my attack points for the corners, then started pushing the car. A few laps in, I reached a high level of focus: I had zero thoughts, just staring at the screen and executing. No hesitation, no ego, no bravado, but i was eager for the challenge. I was relaxed, it felt good, it also felt like I wasn’t really there, I only “came back” after I finished the lap and saw I’d beaten the record.

After that, though, I had a mild headache the rest of the day, and the only thing I wanted to do was sleep.

Since then, I can sometimes enter a decent level of concentration. I can “enforce” it a bit with things like certain music, or working later in the day when I’m sharper, or drinking coffee. Even working on a boring report can sometimes get me into that state just because I know I’ll feel good after finishing it. And recently I started meditating, which I think helps, I notice I feel more concentrated and aware afterwards.

But I’ve never managed to reach the same intensity of focus I had in that sim racing session 2–3 years ago.

So I’m curious: what else can I do to improve this? How can I make that state more attainable and hopefully reach the same level of focus again?",1,1755916780.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

His family in the Philippines is wealthy, but they decided to move to another country. We’ve been together for eight years. Since he just graduated with his second bachelor’s degree (after earning so many certificates) and even graduated cum laude, he said he wanted to invite me to his country. I applied, but I got denied because lately, they’ve been doing mass deportations. Things got strict, so we decided to just go on vacation in another country instead.

I insisted on splitting expenses equally, but he had already bought my plane ticket, booked the hotel rooms, even the attractions and everything we were going to do—already booked and paid for. On the day of the flight, at the last minute, he told me to go inside the airport first since he had to tell my dad something. Turns out, he told my dad that he was going to propose.

Our stay abroad was great—no fights, and honestly, it was one of the best vacations I’ve ever had because he tailored it to what we both wanted. He treated me like a princess the whole time. I never carried luggage, he always gave me his seat on the train even when we were both tired, he’d give me the last bite of food if he knew I liked it, plus the occasional ice cream and coffee stops.

Then he proposed. He even hired a cameraman, and we were wearing the traditional clothes of the country we were visiting. I was overjoyed. I saw the ring and was shocked too. I even told him before that even if it were just a cheese ring, I’d still say yes—but the ring was a gold band with a natural 3-carat diamond, not lab-grown.

We continued the trip, everything went smoothly with no issues at all. But when we got home, that’s when the problems started. My parents weren’t happy with the pasalubongs (souvenirs). My grandmother looked down on what we gave her. Since both my fiancé and I are the eldest children in our families, it feels like we’re “coded” to do better and just suck it up, to try harder to please them next time. 

That infuriated me because my family did nothing but throw shade, saying my fiancé is stingy. When in fact, he’s saving up for our own house abroad and for my tuition for career advancement. Even my parents agrees with my grandmother despite them getting good things too from my boyfriend(designer bag for mom the moment he went to Ph and a designer bag too after we go home from our trip, as well as good stuff too for dad—some limited edition shoes, a jacket from my fiancé’s college, and other goodies) I was so restless, so furious at them for looking down on my fiancé.

That’s exactly how I feel about ChatGPT.

I mean, we’re living in a time when words flow from a machine as if they had intention, wit, and even a spark of emotional intelligence. ChatGPT isn’t just spitting out data—it’s:

- giving us ideas for side hustles and weekend meals  
- explaining wild scientific concepts in cartoon language  
- even becoming a non-judgmental companion at 2am for those “wait, am I doing life right?” questions

I recently found myself deep in conversation with ChatGPT about my next vacation (procrastinating, of course). It somehow recommended the perfect itinerary, complete with quirky coffee shops and museum exhibits. My inner child did a happy dance! ☕

What gets me genuinely happy is seeing people use ChatGPT to:

- knock out cover letters and essays that previously felt like climbing Everest  
- code, compose stories, or brainstorm with AI when inspiration just won’t come  
- even translate hard emotions into texts that don’t sound awkward

And the best part? This is just the start! A few years ago, talking to an AI felt as exciting as narrating your grocery list to a toaster—now, it’s genuinely…fun.

But this brings a ton of questions (and, honestly, joy-filled curiosity):

- What jobs, art forms, or hobbies are going to *explode* in the era of conversational AI?  
- How can we make sure that everyone gets to play with tools like ChatGPT, not just a select few?  
- Will this be the tech that brings us closer, or will it replace the small talk we secretly love at our favorite café?

Admittedly, I’m maybe *too* optimistic about what’s ahead, but whenever I think about a future classroom or boardroom filled with creative tools powered by AI, I get this huge rush of excitement.

ChatGPT isn’t just another gadget—it’s becoming a daily digital sidekick, teacher, and (sometimes) even a buddy who just “gets it.” And that makes tech feel, for the first time in a long while, wonderfully *human*.

After Falling for My Sister’s Husband

Every time I kissed Cordell, my sister Stacy’s eyes burned into us.

I told myself it was just a coincidence-until my family announced their engagement.

She was my sister. I loved her. So I ran from the city and the memories.

Years later, I came back, believing I was free at last.

Stacy and Cordell had a child.

And me? I was tangled in a scandal with notorious playboy Jackson.

Happiness always seemed just out of reach.

Until Jackson slipped a ring on my finger.“Elaine, I’ll love you forever.”

My family cheered-but Cordell?

He pulled me close, his voice dark and possessive: “She’s mine.”



Chapter1

Elaine Valentine and her sister Stacy Valentine had fallen in love with the same man.

Cordell Decker.

Now, he was her brother-in-law.

When she first heard that her sister, Stacy, was going to marry Cordell, she made a firm decision to leave the country.

Her eyes reflected a sense of defeat and despair. ""I'm never coming back, and I won't bless you both.""

After leaving for abroad, she cut off all contact with everyone, even avoiding logging into WhatsApp for a long time.

That was, until one day when she suddenly called Marcelo Valentine, asking for a large sum of money. That was the first time she'd reached out to her family.

As she stepped out of the airport, Rubin Krueger, who had come to pick her up, immediately spotted her. He hurried over and took the suitcase from her hands. ""Ms. Valentine.""

She glanced around. Aside from Rubin, there was no one else to greet her. A bitter smile tugged at the corner of her lips.

At home, Stacy came forward to greet her. ""Elaine, you've finally come back.""

Three years had passed, and Stacy, now married, was even more beautiful than before.

She wore a light blue dress, with delicate butterfly embroidery at the collar. The high slit revealed her long, flawless legs.

Her hair, once long, had been cut short. The ends curled slightly, dyed a soft chestnut brown, accentuating her fair skin. She looked effortlessly chic and stunning.

She descended the stairs slowly, exuding the calm elegance of a wealthy young woman.

""Stacy,"" Elaine called softly, her voice lacking the usual softness and coquettish tone.

Stacy reached the bottom of the stairs and took in Elaine's appearance, noting how much thinner she had become. She looked almost skeletal.

Stacy's heart ached. ""Was life in Drego that tough?""

""It wasn't tough. Everything's fine,"" Elaine replied, always sticking to her default answer when asked about Drego-""Fine.""

Stacy knew Elaine's stubbornness. If Elaine didn't want to share, asking was pointless.

Noticing the fatigue in Elaine's eyes, she suggested, ""Why don't you rest upstairs for a while? After you wake up, I'll have the servants make your favorite dishes.""

""Okay,"" Elaine murmured, too tired to argue. She nodded and went upstairs, familiar with the house and making her way to the guest room with ease.

After a hot shower, she dried her hair and lay down on the bed, closing her eyes.

But her sleep wasn't peaceful. As usual, her dreams were strange and unsettling.

When she woke up, the evening had already settled in. She reached for her phone on the nightstand-it was already 9:30 PM.

She hadn't eaten much on the plane, and now she was starting to feel hungry.

She changed clothes and decided to head downstairs. As she stepped out of the guest room, she glanced down the hallway.

Stacy was on the sofa, watching a variety show, while the maid had placed a fruit platter on the coffee table.

Just as Elaine took a few steps down, she saw Cordell walking back inside. A servant quickly went to take his shoes and place them at his feet.

Her footsteps froze. She gripped the golden handrail tightly, her fingers curling into a fist.

Compared to three years ago, he was even more mature and charismatic, wearing a well-tailored dark suit and a white shirt, exuding a cold, clean aura.

He was bent over at the entrance, changing his shoes, and hadn't noticed her on the stairs.

She hesitated, wondering if she should continue down. She thought it would be awkward for all three of them, and just as she was about to turn back to her room, she heard Stacy's voice calling her name. ""Elaine.""

Her body stiffened. She instinctively bit her lip, her nails digging into her palm, the sharp pain spreading through her hand.

After a long pause, she turned around, her expression returning to its usual calm, with no hint of emotion.

Stacy was sitting on the sofa, looking at her, while Cordell, still at the entrance, had also turned his attention toward her.

She glanced at him briefly before subtly shifting her gaze, walking down the stairs. ""Stacy, I'm hungry.""

Stacy smiled warmly and called out, ""Janine.""

Janine Zavala emerged from the kitchen, and upon seeing Elaine walking down the stairs, she cheerfully greeted her, ""Ms. Valentine.""

Before Stacy married Cordell, Elaine used to visit the Decker family frequently, so the household staff all knew her.

Elaine had never been haughty, despite being from a wealthy family. She used to call Janine sweetly, and the maid had a good impression of her.

Cordell entered the living room, and Stacy effortlessly took his coat, hanging it up in the cloakroom. The way they interacted felt like an old married couple.

Elaine couldn't help but feel a sharp pang in her chest, as if a blade was cutting through her heart, leaving a painful, aching tightness.

Janine brought out the food prepared for her, and Elaine walked to the dining room. She casually asked, ""Where's Annie?""

Annie Ortiz was an old servant of the Decker family who had always been very fond of Elaine. Whenever she visited, Annie would prepare her favorite dishes and fruits.

Stacy, noticing the faint smell of alcohol on Cordell, asked the servant to prepare some coffee. Hearing Elaine's question, she replied, ""Annie's grandson is sick, so she took the day off.""

Cordell, looking tired, leaned back on the sofa. He glanced over at the dining table, where Elaine sat. Her face had lost its youthful roundness. The white dress she wore made her skin look porcelain-smooth, and her features were sharp and delicate.

She had lost a lot of weight, the baby fat completely gone. Her sharp chin made her eyes appear even larger and more striking. They were still as dark and bright as before.

Elaine wasn't eating much. She took only a few bites before setting her fork down.

Noticing the uneaten food, Janine asked, ""Ms. Valentine, isn't the food to your liking?""

It shouldn't be the case, as everything was prepared just as she liked it.

Before Elaine could respond, Cordell spoke up, ""You shouldn't eat too much at night.""

As soon as he said that, Elaine looked up and met his gaze.

Chapter2

This was the first time in three years that Elaine looked directly at him, but after just a moment, she quickly averted her gaze.

Her eyes, as clear and dark as ever, no longer held the love they once did. Instead, they were calm and indifferent.

In that instant, his heart felt empty, and his gaze dimmed.

""Elaine, Mom and Dad went to Orevine to pick up Grandpa, so the house is empty. You should stay here for the next few days,"" Stacy said, adopting the tone of a considerate older sister. ""I can take care of you here at the Decker family home. You've been through so much on your own these past years.""

Even though Stacy knew about the past between Elaine and Cordell, she still invited her to stay at the Decker family house. If it weren't for Stacy's constant love and care, Elaine might have thought she was trying to make things awkward on purpose.

Though Stacy had an excellent reputation in high society-beautiful, graceful, and kind-inviting her husband's ex-girlfriend to stay in their home seemed a little too generous, even for her.

Despite being her sister, wouldn't any woman, in the name of protecting her marriage, be more cautious and guarded?

A faint, cold smile tugged at the corner of Elaine's lips. ""I've been alone in Drego all these years too.""

She had learned to survive in that strange, foreign place. Independence was something she had mastered. Besides, the Valentine family house was still home, and there were servants here.

Stacy looked at Elaine's thin face with concern. ""It's been three years since we've seen each other. Don't you want to catch up?""

""We'll have plenty of time for that,"" Elaine replied. Given the awkwardness between her and Cordell, there was really no reason to stay under the same roof. ""Stacy, please arrange for a driver to take me back to the Valentine family home.""

Cordell put down his coffee, grabbed his coat, and started to head upstairs. After taking a few steps, he paused. ""It's getting late. If you're leaving, maybe it's better to wait until tomorrow.""

Elaine glanced at the clock in the living room-it wasn't even 10:30 PM yet, hardly late. But seeing the look of expectation in Stacy's eyes, she hesitated for a moment before replying, ""Alright, I'll stay. Sorry for the trouble.""

As she spoke, Cordell, who had been halfway up the stairs, froze. Her polite, distant tone felt like a sharp knife, suddenly and painfully stabbing into his heart.

\*\*\*\*\*

Having just returned to the country, Elaine was still adjusting to the time difference. She spent the whole night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. When dawn finally broke, she managed to doze off for a short while.

She decided to head back to the Valentine family home that day. After waking up, she packed the clothes she'd worn the previous night, tidied up, and then headed downstairs.

In the living room, Cordell sat at the dining table in casual loungewear, reading the newspaper. A cup of milk and an untouched sandwich sat in front of him.

He looked up briefly, his expression serious as he read. When he heard her footsteps coming downstairs, he glanced over and called out, ""Janine."" The maid immediately set out her breakfast on the table.

Elaine walked over and sat down across from him, greeting him casually, ""Good morning.""

Cordell paused for a moment, then replied, ""Good morning.""

She found it strange. It was almost 8 AM-why was he still sitting here reading the newspaper? Wasn't he supposed to be going to work?

Her breakfast was the same as his: a sandwich, a cup of milk, and toast. She took a few bites of the sandwich, finished her milk, and then set down her napkin.

""Breakfast is important. You're eating too little,"" Cordell said, closing the newspaper. Her small appetite was honestly surprising.

Chapter3

""Mr. Decker."" Elaine dismissed his attempt to be considerate with a sharp, sarcastic smile, the corners of her mouth curling up. ""Focus on your own business and stop meddling in matters that have nothing to do with you.""

Her simple ""Mr. Decker"" landed like a heavy blow, a hammer crashing into his chest.

His face went pale. ""You're calling me Mr. Decker?""

She smirked, her tone turning cold and biting. ""What should I call you then?""

Cordell's face drained of color. He pressed his lips together, looking momentarily lost in thought. After a long silence, he finally muttered, ""Call me whatever you like.""

The atmosphere in the living room grew thick with tension. The servants, sensing the awkwardness between them, stayed far away.

""Cordell, Shauna seems to-"" Stacy's anxious voice broke the silence.

Stacy entered the room and noticed the strange tension between the two. She looked confused and asked, ""Elaine, you're up?""

Elaine turned to glance at the entrance. It was hard to ignore how well Stacy looked in her dress-her graceful features and tall, slender figure gave her the air of a woman from the early 20th century. She stood there effortlessly, exuding a refined, aristocratic charm.

But then, Elaine's gaze locked on something and her face went pale.

In Stacy's arms was a baby, dressed in pink, with tiny, chubby hands clutching her dress.

Stacy noticed where Elaine was looking and softly said, ""Elaine, this is Shauna Decker. She's just over a year old.""

If three years ago, when Cordell and Stacy married, her world had crumbled, then at this moment, it felt as though it had turned barren.

She clutched the edge of the table, doing everything she could to hide her shock and force herself to stay calm.

She should have seen it coming. They had been married for three years. Of course, they would have a child by now.

She remembered the days when they used to lie together, dreaming about the future. On the lawn behind the Decker family garden, she would lie in his arms, playing with his long, fair fingers.

""Cordell, what do you want to do after you graduate from college?""

He thought for a moment, then answered seriously, ""Work hard to make money, and then marry you.""

When he said that, her eyes, sparkling like stars, lit up with excitement. ""Then what?""

""Then you'll do your duty as my wife and give me a child. A daughter, ideally-one just like you, sweet and adorable. I'll spoil both of you.""

His tone was casual, but his gaze was intense and sincere.

Her heart soared with happiness, though she pretended to be coy, blushing as she playfully pinched his arm. ""You're impossible.""

Back then, she could think of nothing else but marrying Cordell after graduation.

""Then you'll need to think of a name for our daughter.""

""Let's call her Shauna.""

She wrinkled her nose in distaste. ""That's too ordinary. You're a top student at Hillcrest Academy, and you give your daughter such a lazy name? She'll probably disown you when she grows up.""

""But you and she will be my only ones."" He wasn't good with sweet talk, and after saying that, his ears turned red.

She hugged him tightly in excitement and kissed his cheek. ""Alright, but we agreed-the name Shauna will only be her nickname. You'll have to come up with a real name later, or else I'm worried she'll resent us when she grows up.""

Elaine smiled softly, her eyes clouded with a thin layer of mist. She forced herself to hold back the emotions, almost as if she were mocking herself, murmuring softly, ""I'm an aunt now. That's fine.""

Chapter4

Elaine walked over to Stacy, her gaze falling on the child in her arms.

Shauna's skin was as smooth and white as porcelain, like a little doll. Her chubby cheeks were a soft pink, and her big, round eyes were as dark and shiny as marbles, making her irresistibly cute.

A mist seemed to form in Elaine's eyes as she reached out and gently touched the baby's soft cheek. It felt as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, soft and tender under her fingertips.

This was his daughter, Shauna.

She paused for a moment, then gave a bitter smile.

He had a wife. He had a child. His daughter was named Shauna-the name that matched the daughter they had once imagined having together.

Stacy noticed Elaine's discomfort, but with everything happening, she couldn't focus on it. Her voice became urgent. ""Cordell, Shauna has diarrhea.""

Cordell immediately stood up, walking quickly toward them. He glanced at the baby in Stacy's arms before grabbing the car keys from the coffee table. ""We're going to the hospital.""

Elaine instinctively took a step forward to follow, but then stopped after just a couple of steps.

In his arms was his wife. His wife was holding their child. What was she supposed to do?

Watching them leave, Elaine bit her lip, clenching her hands by her sides. A faint, metallic taste lingered in her mouth.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Silver Oak Grand Hotel was the largest in Aleshire, grand and opulent. The corridors were lined with deep purple, embroidered carpets, and the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling looked like a blooming white flowers, beautiful and sparkling.

With a soft chime, the elevator doors opened, and Elaine stepped out.

She wore a white dress with beige high heels. Her face was calm and pale, with a quiet elegance, and her tall, slender figure stood out as she walked.

She made her way straight to the presidential suite. Before arriving, she had learned that Jackson Mason had a long-term suite here at the Silver Oak Grand Hotel, one he used for his affairs.

To put it simply, ""affairs"" meant a lot more than casual meetings.

As she raised her hand to knock on the door, it suddenly swung open from the inside. A woman, crying and hiding her face, rushed past her, disheveled, clutching her purse tightly as she left in a hurry.

Jackson changed lovers every three months. He had just broken up with his last one a few days ago, so this woman... had her attempts to seduce him failed?

Elaine pushed the half-open door the rest of the way open and stepped inside. Her heart skipped a beat with nervousness as she scanned the room. It was empty, except for the sound of water running from the bathroom.

She tossed her handbag onto the couch and waited. After a moment, the bathroom door opened.

She turned her head at the sound, and her gaze fell on the man's strong, sculpted body. His handsome face was slightly flushed from the steam, and his wet, black hair clung to his forehead, with droplets of water glistening on his skin.

His chest, a smooth honey-tan, was flat and toned, and as the water from his hair dripped onto his chest, it followed a path down his body, slipping under the towel wrapped loosely around his waist.

This man-he was even more strikingly handsome than any celebrity.

When Jackson saw someone unexpectedly standing in the room, his brows furrowed in irritation. ""Get out.""

Elaine's cheeks flushed slightly. She cleared her throat to hide her embarrassment.

He was simply too good-looking.

It felt as if God had been extra kind to him when creating him.

Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and then stated, ""Mr. Mason, I'm here to apply for the position of your next lover.""

Chapter5

Elaine was naturally shy, and saying something like that was difficult for her.

Once she spoke, her delicate face turned a soft pink, glowing under the light, her skin vibrant and radiant.

Her skin was flawless-smooth and pale like jewel. Her cheeks were soft and rosy, almost baby-like, so tender that they seemed to invite a gentle touch. Her beauty was pure but also had a subtle charm.

Jackson narrowed his eyes, looking her over slowly. His thin lips curled into a sarcastic smile. ""Not every woman who comes knocking gets what she wants.""

Elaine blushed with both embarrassment and frustration. The flush on her fair skin made her look even more captivating and radiant, while her clear eyes shone brightly.

She bit her lip and, gathering courage, moved closer to him, wrapping her arms around his waist-but not pressing her body against his.

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze. ""So, what do you think of me?""

""Need money?"" His eyes twinkled with amusement as he glanced at her arms wrapped around him, as delicate as lotus stems.

""You're handsome. Being with you wouldn't be a loss,"" she said, flashing a smile. The chandelier overhead sparkled in her dark eyes.

Jackson scoffed. ""Is that all?""

She paused, thinking for a moment, then shook her head. ""That's it.""

He'd met plenty of women like her before, but none had been this blunt.

He couldn't help but look at her a little longer.

After a long silence, as he still hadn't spoken, Elaine raised her gaze to meet his deep, unreadable eyes. Slowly, her eyes traveled down his face until they landed on his thin, sculpted lips.

Standing on tiptoe, she leaned in. Just as her lips were about to brush against his, Jackson pulled away.

His voice was cold and detached. ""Go take a shower first.""

""Okay."" She responded quietly, heading to the bathroom, turning on the water, and standing under the shower, her heart pounding loudly.

For a brief moment, she regretted acting so impulsively. She stayed in the bathroom, hesitating for a while, before putting on a bathrobe. Taking a deep breath, she finally opened the bathroom door.

Jackson was leaning against the headboard, watching as she stepped out. The steam from the shower left a soft pink glow on her face, and the bathrobe was loosely tied, exposing her delicate collarbone, her skin flawless and smooth.

Elaine tugged at the bathrobe, which was clearly too big for her. It was Jackson's, and it hung loosely, almost to her ankles, looking slightly comical.

Seeing her awkwardly clutching the robe, Jackson frowned slightly. ""If you regret it, you can leave now.""

Elaine hesitated, then bit her lower lip, moving closer and slowly untying the bathrobe.

Though she was slender, her figure was well-proportioned, and her skin glowed like fine porcelain, smooth and radiant under the light.

She bent down to kiss him, but her inexperience showed in her tentative, unsure movements. Jackson turned his head slightly, avoiding her. ""No experience?""

Her face instantly flushed, and she wished she could bury her head in the pillow. She barely whispered, ""No.""

Jackson's gaze flickered to her flushed cheeks, and he noticed her long, dark lashes trembling slightly, revealing her nervousness and uncertainty.

He wasn't someone who believed in being morally perfect, so he didn't expect others to be either. But seeing her so shy and flustered made him pause for a moment.

Elaine lowered her eyes, waiting for him to react. After a long silence, feeling embarrassed, she almost wanted to pull back entirely.

She tried to move away from him, but in the next moment, he grabbed the back of her head, pulling her face down, flipping them over in one smooth motion.

Everything seemed to spin, and Elaine, panicked, clung to his neck, her eyes wide with a momentary sense of confusion.

As they switched positions, she found herself staring up at his handsome face, her breath catching in her throat.

Chapter6

The light from above cast a shadow across Jackson's handsome face as he fixed his gaze on her. ""What's your name?"" he asked.

Elaine's face turned slightly pale, and she answered slowly, each word measured. ""Elaine.""

""Have you thought this through? It's not too late to change your mind."" Jackson gave her one final chance.

Uncomfortable, Elaine shifted slightly. Jackson's expression darkened as he growled, ""Don't move!""

Startled, Elaine froze, her eyes locked on him. Her body became stiff and tense.

She was so nervous that her breath came in short, uneven bursts, causing her to speak a little more quickly than usual. ""I've thought about it carefully. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.""

She had been mulling it over for days before making the decision.

On her way here, she had almost reconsidered for a moment, but...

At that thought, a self-deprecating smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and her eyes dimmed with a touch of sadness.

Jackson noticed the shift in her expression, sensing the faint sorrow on her face. His heart stirred slightly. ""How much do you need?""

Elaine blinked in confusion. ""What?""

Jackson furrowed his brow, his tone cool. ""How much money do you need?""

She stared at him, slightly stunned. His jawline was sharp and perfectly defined, and for a moment, she lost herself in the details of his face before quickly snapping out of it. With a soft smile, she responded, ""You can decide.""

Jackson raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation in his expression.

She smiled again, her voice soft. ""Mr. Mason isn't the type to be stingy, so I'm not worried you'll give me too little.""

She had once thought that when she turned twenty, she would give the most precious thing she had to Cordell, the man she had loved for so long.

Jackson studied her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Afterward, Jackson pulled away and got up to head into the bathroom.

Elaine grabbed the blanket and pulled it around her, her gaze vacant as she stared at the ceiling. The crystal chandelier above cast a bright light, making her face look as pale as paper.

The sound of running water from the bathroom was loud in the quiet room.

A short while later, Jackson emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet. When he came back out, he was dressed, sharp and impeccably put together.

The deep blue shirt fit him perfectly, and his trousers highlighted his long, lean legs. His features were sharp, almost sculpted, and his dark eyes were especially striking under the light.

Elaine had gathered herself by then. Apart from her slightly red eyes, she seemed composed.

Jackson pulled out a pen and paper, writing a check and placing it on the nightstand. His eyes were void of emotion.

""Leave your contact information when you leave. I'll call you if I need anything.""

He picked up his custom-made watch from the table and strapped it on, then walked toward the door. After taking a few steps, he stopped, not turning around. His voice was flat and distant.

""You should have done your homework before coming. Do you know what the rules are?""

She answered softly, ""I know.""

Jackson's women were only meant to last for three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be available whenever he called. They couldn't visit him at his company or cause any trouble. After three months, they were to part ways without further contact.

Chapter7

Jackson's women had a shelf life of three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be at his beck and call. They weren't allowed to visit him at his company or cause trouble. Once the three months were up, they were expected to leave and not look back.

Rumor had it that Jackson was cold and indifferent by nature, yet women still flocked to him, eager to get into his bed.

Not only was he rich and powerful, but he also treated women generously. After the three months were over, they were sent off with a generous severance package.

Jackson didn't linger. He opened the door and left.

Elaine picked up the check from the bedside table, staring at the figure written on it. A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips. 170 thousand dollars...

Because Cordell didn't need her, she had given the most precious thing she had to a stranger.

This man, in both looks and background, was no less impressive than Cordell, so she wasn't losing out, right?

Then why did it hurt so much? The kind of pain that came from being discarded but still unwilling to let go.

A cold tear slid down her cheek, and she bit her wrist, trying to stop herself from crying.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Valentine family estate had been passed down through generations. It was a grand, old house that resembled a castle, with ivy crawling up the red brick walls, the green vines bright and striking in the sunlight.

Tall, sturdy sycamore trees lined the yard, the flowerbeds were neat and beautiful, and the fountain sparkled like a goddess scattering flowers. In the summer, walking along the shady paths beneath the trees was cool and refreshing.

Elaine had a lounge chair set up by the flowerbed on the lawn. She sat quietly, reading a book, with a cup of coffee resting on the small glass table beside her. It was a scene of perfect peace, like stealing a few moments of blissful calm.

Olivia hurried over, her voice filled with excitement. ""Ms. Valentine, your father and grandfather are back.""

""I know,"" Elaine replied, closing her book. She composed herself and walked back to the living room.

In the living room, an elderly man in his sixties sat on the sofa, dressed in a traditional suit. He held a finely carved cane and wore a ring on his thumb, his graying hair perfectly groomed.

Beside him sat a couple who looked weary from travel. The man wore a suit, and the woman wore a deep purple dress, draped with a beige shawl. They exuded an air of wealth and elegance.

Elaine changed her shoes at the entrance and walked into the living room. ""Grandfather, Dad, Mom.""

Marcelo gave a brief nod. In contrast to his indifference, Constance Valentine eagerly stepped forward, gently touching Elaine's thin face, her eyes glistening with tears. ""Elaine, you've lost weight.""

Elaine opened her mouth, about to respond, but just then, a cold snort echoed through the quiet room.

She turned her gaze toward the sound, meeting the stern eyes of her grandfather Abraham Valentine, who glared at her. ""So, you finally decided to come back?""

She pressed her lips together and remained silent.

Abraham had never liked her.

After Constance lost a lot of blood during her birth and couldn't have more children, the male line of the Valentine family was cut off with Marcelo.

The Valentine family had vast wealth, and someone had to inherit it. Abraham had suggested that Marcelo take a mistress, have a son, and bring him into the family, paying the woman off and sending her away from Aleshire.

Marcelo and Constance had been high school classmates, and their relationship had been solid ever since. They started dating in college and had been happily married for many years.

Marcelo had firmly rejected Abraham's proposal, and the two often argued about it, to the point that Abraham once became so angry he had to be hospitalized.

Chapter8

Because of this, Marcelo had always been more affectionate toward Stacy than Elaine, treating her with indifference.

Moreover, since Abraham never liked her, Elaine was sent to live with her grandmother of the maternal line in Prarc Town when she was young. She stayed there until her grandmother passed away when she was thirteen, at which point she was brought back to the Valentine family.

Elaine stood stiffly, and Constance quickly stepped in to help. ""Dad, Elaine came back specifically for your 80th birthday, which is in two weeks. She wanted to wish you well."" She then shot Elaine a pointed look.

Elaine pretended not to notice and stayed silent. If it hadn't been for Constance's repeated insistence, she wouldn't have returned for such an insignificant birthday celebration.

In the Valentine family, only Constance and Stacy treated her with any kindness. However, ever since Stacy married Cordell, there had been a distance between them.

To be fair, it was a distance that only she felt.

Stacy still treated her with the same care-checking on her when she was sick, asking about her daily well-being.

Elaine had struggled with this for a long time, which led her to deliberately distance herself from Stacy, and as a result, their relationship was no longer as close as it once had been.

Marcelo didn't want her return to disrupt the family's peace, so he joined in with Constance, saying, ""Dad, Elaine called me a few days ago to ask what kind of gift you'd like. She's really put a lot of thought into choosing something special for you.""

If it hadn't been for Marcelo's reminder, Elaine would have completely forgotten about preparing a gift. Thankfully, she still had two weeks, plenty of time to find something fitting for Abraham.

When Marcelo said this, Abraham held back his anger, though his face remained stern.

Elaine didn't mind, though. In her memories, Abraham had always been like this-stern and unapproachable.

The only time he had been genuinely warm was when she was sixteen. She had scored first in the entire school and was accepted into a prestigious high school. That same year, Stacy had used the family's connections to get into the same school.

Just then, the phone in the living room rang. Constance, who was standing next to it, picked up the receiver.

After a brief conversation, she smiled brightly. ""Okay, got it.""

She hung up the phone and turned to Abraham. ""Dad, Stacy and Cordell know you're back today. They've made a reservation at a restaurant to welcome you.""

Abraham's expression softened slightly. ""Stacy is such a thoughtful child.""

Before long, Stacy and Cordell arrived at the Valentine family home to pick everyone up for dinner.

As soon as Stacy entered the living room, she walked over and hugged Abraham's arm before sitting beside him. Her delicate makeup only made her appear even more graceful and lovely.

""Grandpa, I've missed you so much these days. How was your time in Orevine?""

Abraham clearly appreciated her affection. A rare smile appeared on his usually stern face. ""I'm well. Everything is fine. But why didn't you bring Shauna?""

Stacy smiled brightly. ""We're going out later, so it's not convenient to bring her along.""

In the evening, the group went to the restaurant, where the waiter led them to a private dining room.

Stacy sat to Abraham's right, and throughout the meal, she kept the conversation lively with amusing stories that made him laugh heartily.

Abraham shared stories about Orevine's customs and scenery, and everyone listened attentively.

The conversation flowed smoothly, but Elaine sat quietly, feeling out of place at the family gathering.

She felt suffocated, like an outsider, and eventually excused herself, saying she needed to use the bathroom, before quietly slipping away from the table.

Chapter9

As Elaine opened the door to the private room, she found herself face to face with someone exiting the opposite room. Their eyes met, and they both paused for a moment.

Out of politeness, she was about to greet him with a ""Mr. Mason,"" but the words got stuck in her throat.

Jackson gave her a brief glance, walking past her as if she were a stranger, his eyes not lingering for even a second.

Watching his tall, straight figure retreat, she awkwardly rubbed her nose. Noticing he was headed toward the restroom, she decided against going herself.

She walked down the hallway to the end, lingering in a quiet corner near the stairs, where she distracted herself with her phone. When she saw it was nearly time, she tucked her phone away and made her way back to the private room.

As she neared the room, she saw Cordell standing in the hallway just outside.

He wore a V-neck shirt and brown casual trousers.

Just like years ago, his style was simple and relaxed, but it made him look effortlessly handsome.

A cigarette hung between his fingers, and the smoke curled lazily around him. The light from the crystal chandelier above made his striking features look even more defined.

When he saw her return, he took a long drag from his cigarette, extinguished it, and tossed it into the nearby trash can. He shot her a quiet glance before pushing open the door and stepping inside.

Given the sensitive nature of their current relationship, it would have been too obvious if they had entered together, so she waited outside for a moment before finally entering.

At the dinner table, Constance noticed Elaine's slight frame and was overly attentive, constantly serving her more food. Elaine's appetite was small, but not wanting to disappoint Constance, she forced herself to finish what was on her plate, feeling stuffed and uncomfortable.

After dinner, they all left the private room.

At the same time, a group of sharply dressed men emerged from the opposite room.

At the head of the group was a man who exuded charm, with an exceptional presence.

Marcelo stepped forward and extended his hand to greet him. ""Mr. Mason, long time no see.""

Jackson took his hand with a polite but somewhat distant smile.

His gaze briefly swept over the people standing behind Marcelo. ""Mr. Valentine, is this a family gathering?""

Jackson's heart skipped a beat. 'So, this woman is the daughter of the Valentine family?'

Marcelo, ever the gracious host, responded, ""Yes, we're welcoming my father home.""

Jackson's eyes flicked over Elaine and landed on Abraham, who was standing beside Stacy.

Though they hadn't met before, Jackson, raised with good manners, offered a polite greeting. ""Good evening, Mr. Valentine.""

It was just a brief glance, but for a fleeting moment, Elaine felt a sharp chill in his gaze.

'What did I do to upset him?' she wondered.

Abraham, hearing Marcelo call Jackson ""Mr. Mason,"" quickly deduced that the man before them was the renowned head of the Mason family.

Having been involved in business in his younger days, Abraham had some old connections with Jackson's grandfather. He smiled, though his face remained deeply lined with age.

""The last time I saw you, you were just six years old. You've grown up so much since then.""

The attempt at small talk was awkward and forced.

Jackson raised an eyebrow, offering a polite smile but saying nothing. The crystal lighting in the hallway highlighted his sharp, handsome features, making him look even more striking.

Cordell stepped forward to greet him, extending his hand. He briefly scanned the people behind Jackson, recognizing some of them as executives from various companies. ""Mr. Mason, are you here to discuss a project?""

Jackson gave a slight nod, his dark eyes reflecting the lights, adding a touch of mystery.

The men with Jackson exchanged pleasantries and handshakes with Cordell, the entire interaction formal and courteous.

Once the greetings were done, the two groups filed out of the restaurant, one after the other.",1,1755915896.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

What felt like security gets pulled from under you, and you see the truth: you’ve always been your own support system.

People love to put you in categories—attractive or not, experienced or not—but none of that really matters. Connection isn’t a formula. You can’t make someone like you. Relationships come and go. They have their own rhythm—ebbs and flows.

I try not to act out of spite when things fade. Instead, I see them as chapters—gifts, memories, artifacts of a time that mattered, even if it didn’t last. The last girl I spoke to, across the country, gave me a Lego Batman keychain, a Lego racecar, and some candy. I still have them. We don’t talk anymore, but the objects remain—small reminders of a connection that once was. And now, it’s just me, alone with them.

Loneliness is real, but structure helps. Coffee, a smoothie, the grocery store, the gym—small routines that give rhythm to life. Rhythm gives momentum, and momentum keeps you moving forward.

Some days I don’t leave my room. People call me attractive until I open my mouth and show who I am. Maybe that’s the truth: labels only go so far. In the end, what matters is the voice you carry—and whether you keep speaking it into the world.",1,1755915872.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

a little bit of background, because every story has two sides, and according to my brother, i have ruined his life for taking away his only father figure, so i deserve nothing more that to be robbed of every good thing or joy i have in my life...

when i was about two my parents divorced and we moved to Nebraska. my mother met a man and had a couple of more kids with him. he was the only father figure my older brother and i had for most of our lives. this man eventually started sexually abusing me, and i broke down in school one day when they were talking about sexual harassment and that it was not okay to do in school. i spoke with a counselor and eventually to police. this was by far a worse experience than the abuse i was experiencing. i was basically interrogated for hours at the police station and eventually taken into foster care. i was in foster care for a few months then went back home. i was told that my mother's boyfriend could not be around me, but my mother didn't care. he would still watch us children and to prevent me from being around her boyfriend she would just lock me inside my room all night while her was there. he was upset that i told someone about ""our secret"" and started r\*\*ing me when he would come over. i told my guardian ad litem and was taken from the home again to live with my grandparents. (my mother's ex saw no jail time) eventually i moved in with my father who was an abusive alcoholic. my brother moved in with my father, his girlfriend, and i for a short time, then went to live back with my mother who eventually moved out of state. i stayed with my father for a few years and eventually reconnected with my mother and moved out of state with her. i had a high school boyfriend who followed me and we had a son together. after having my son, and things not working out with my boyfriend i moved back in with my mother. my mother's new boyfriend got me addicted to meth, i struggled with addiction for some time, got arrested for selling drugs, and then worked on straightening my life out. when i was dealing with my addiction my ex took care of my son and decided to move home to Nebraska. after i sobered up for the first time i decided to move back to Nebraska to be with my son.   
I did well in Nebraska for some time, and met an older gentlemen we will call ""L"". i met L while i was working at a fast food chain, he was a regular customer and once i became manager i would often times comp his food in exchange for a good story. L was the type of man you could tell him your favorite snacks and he would stock his home with it. L would always be someone i could call with all my problems and he would listen without judgement. he knew how i liked my coffee, he knew my favorite spot to sit at the river. if L was 40 years younger i would have married him. L spent every birthday, holiday, good days, and bad days with me. while working at this fast food chain i started having car troubles one day. L offered me a ride home and instead of taking me home he brought me to a car lot. he said he wanted to show me a car and we took it for a test drive. the car was perfect.... except for the price tag on it. it was only $5,000 but there was no way i would even get approved for a loan for it because i was only 24 at the time, my credit was horrible, and even thought i was living with a friend i still was not making enough for a car payment. that's when L told me he already bought me the car, he just wanted to make sure I liked it before he had me sign the papers. I cried. nobody in my life has ever been this kind to me.   
eventually i started having issues with my roommate and her fiancé. L took this opportunity to purchase me a house. while we were out looking at houses i found a cute little two bedroom close to where my son's father lived. perfect size for myself and my son. L told me he was going to pay for the down payment and help with with all the paperwork to establish a mortgage in my name, since i had no idea how all that stuff worked. when we sat down to process the closing paperwork i realized that instead of only putting the money down for the down payment, he paid for the house entirely. when I asked him why, he said that after learning my story and hearing everything that i had been through, it was time i had stability and a place i could call home that no one could take away from me. that man spent every holiday at my house. he would come over when he was feeling lonely, i would cook him meals to take home, so i knew he was eating a healthy meal. he was more than just a friend to me. he was family.  
unfortunately, i relapsed, and L still stayed by my side. eventually addiction does what it does and i got into trouble and had to spend some time in prison. before i went to prison, i married a friend i had known in high school who promised to make sure my home was taken care of while i was in prison. he promised to stay faithful to me while i was in prison, but i soon found out that was a lie. not only did he get another woman pregnant, but he moved her into my home. i found out through mutual friends that this woman was making herself right at home, throwing out my personal things like my clothes and pictures of me and my son.   
during my prison sentence i attempted to repair relationships with my family, one being my older brother. it was not because i had done a lot of damage to my brother and i's relationship, but when i was using i just stopped talking to most of my family because i did not want to hear how i was ""better than that"" and deal with the disappointment of my family for relapsing. i am the only addict in my immediate family and they do not really understand addiction. my brother became my rock. he helped me find a good divorce attorney, listened to me cry for hours about my crumbling marriage, and kept me smiling in what i thought was one of the worst situations i have been in. in the state of Nebraska, when you get a divorce, you have to split all marital assets evenly. this means i would lose my house. lucky for me, i bought the house before the marriage and my lawyer was able to prove that my ex-husband did not  help provide for anything in that house, including repairs and/or bills, and i was able to keep my house. while i was in prison, my ex-husband relapsed and completely destroyed my home. my brother offered to help repair what he could while i was in prison, so i did not come home to a disaster.   
my brother works for the post office. while out on hos route one day, he stepped off a customers porch the wrong way and tore every tendon/ligament in his ankle and was out of work for some time. while on a call with him one day, he expressed his concerns about not being well enough to check on my house as much as he would like to, beings how no one was occupying the home any longer and he was temporarily disabled. he mentioned that he thought it may be best to sell the home, that way when i got out i could get a fresh start as well, without the worries of drug-using friends stopping by because they knew where i lived. he played the part of concerned big brother perfectly. he knew how hard addiction was, and they likelihood of me staying sober, even without temptations.  would i be able to say no if one of my old friends stopped by?   
i thought about this for a few days and spoke things over with a drug counselor in the prison, and decided that he ay be right. when we spoke about it again, i asked him what we had to do to sell my house, and what he would do with the money in the meantime. we spoke about him putting it into an account for me until i got out. i agreed and he told me in order for him to do this he needed me to send him a power-of-attorney form, which i did. a few weeks later we spoke about the sale of the house again, he told me that some contractor had stopped him when he was at the house checking on things and the contractor gave him his card. he said that the contractor offered him $50,000 for the house as is. with the damage my ex-husband had done to the house, my brother thought that this was probably the best we could do as far as pricing goes.   
then my brother dropped a bombshell.... his landlord had decided to sell the home he was renting and was not going to renew his lease. he still had a few months to figure things out, but he really wanted to buy a house for him and his family. he complained that while he was saving some money, he did not have enough for a down payment on a house, and he would not be able to come up with that amount by the time his lease was up. he then expressed that his savings would be depleted when the lease was up because he would have to pay a deposit, first month, and last month's rent on a new place, having to start all over for saving up to put a down payment on a house. he asked me if i would be willing to lend him the money to put a down payment on a house after he sold my house. he convinced me that this would be perfect because he can get a house big enough for me as well, maybe find a home with a finished basement or even an apartment in the basement. that way i could have family support when i got out as well.  
i was a little hesitant, as my brother and i have had a bit of a strained relationship growing up. he hated me when we were little. he was the ""golden child"", getting praised for everything. he would always get whatever he wanted. i was just the weird little sister. the little sister that was ""too smart for her own good"". i always tried to be friendly with him and have a relationship with him, but he never had anything good to say about me. i thought that when he came around when i was in prison was a new start. he could finally see that i was willing to turn my life around. he felt bad for being so cruel when we were growing up. the way we spoke to each other while i was in prison, i really thought we had a chance to reconnect and change our entire relationship! this was the type of family bond i have LONGED for my whole life!! i finally felt like i had a family who loved me!  
i wont lie i jumped on the chance to live with him! i imagined our lives living together, bonding with my nieces and nephew. cooking dinners with his wife in the kitchen. watching movies together at night. having a family game night with my brother and his kids! this was something i had only dreamed of. finally having my big brother in my life!!  
the house my brother was currently renting was so small, too small for the size of his family. the house had a tiny backyard, a kitchen that had hardly any storage, and a bathroom you couldn't turn around in, let alone try to bathe the children. i felt in my heart this was the right thing to do.   
family is supposed to always be there for family. family is supposed to help family.   
plus, i still had about two years until i got out of prison. i asked my brother if i could sleep on it, but i told him that i feel he may be right, it may be best that i have his family support to help me when i got out of prison. that it will be hard having all that freedom when i got out, and i could really use his love and support when i got out. the next day i let him know that i decided that he was 100% correct, and to start looking for a house for all of us.   
eventually my brother found the perfect house, and sent me lots of pictures.   
i moved from the main prison to a work-release center and found a job cleaning in a warehouse. that's when i met my (now) husband. he lived in the same city as the work-release center, he was also a recovering addict who straightened out his life, and he was not the typical type of man i date. it took him months of pursuing for me to finally agree to start dating him. i explained the situation with my brother to my husband one day, and told him how i thought it was a great idea that i had his support, and that i may move back to the city i was in before i went to prison. he thought that was great but expressed his concerns about how my brother was intending to pay me back.  
this is what my brother wanted me to do:  
i was to move in with him - into the basement. he wanted me to pay him $600 a month for rent and half of the utility bills. he was then going to save the $600 a month into an account and use that money to pay me back for the money he used to buy the house. i would have a curfew, he did not want me to have ANY friends of (including my now-husband), and he did not want me to stay the night anywhere for at least the first 3 months.   
while i was concerned about his rules, i figured that my brother was just looking out for me, and wanted me to stay sober. my husband did not think it was right that my brother intended to use the money i paid him for rent to pay me back, but he said it was not his decision. he then offered to let me move in with him when i got out of prison - i still had a little under a year until i got out. i told him i would think about it and that me moving in with him depended on how the relationship progressed.   
as the months went by, our relationship grew, and two months before i got out, my husband proposed. we spoke about my living situation once more, and my husband brought up that fact that i had started establishing a sober community, i have a church i love here, my job is here, and i have a home (if i wanted it) here in town. he once again suggested that i could move in with him, if i wanted to.   
when i went back to the center that night i called my brother and spoke with him about everything. i told him that i knew we had made plans for me to move in, but i had established myself here in this city, and beings how all of my ""dr\*g"" friends live in the same city my brother does, maybe it is not best that i return? he immediately blew up on me and started screaming how i ruined all of his plans for ""the first d\*ck that gave me attention"". he said that i am just like our mother and am choosing a man over family. how he could not afford the house and bills on his own and he was counting on my rent and help to pay all of the bills. how this is a stupid decision and i will just end up relapsing again because i am choosing a man i do not know over a family member i have grown up with. he hung up on me and refused to answer my calls for the rest of the night.   
eventually things calmed down and my calls resumed with my brother. i decided to move in with my husband, since i had established myself here in this city. my husband and i would often drive to my brother's city and spend time with him and his family. things were going well until it came time for me to re-establish visitations with my son.  
part of the agreement my brother and i had in regards to the money from the sale of my house was that he was going to set aside money for me to fix my car and money to get a lawyer to get visitation back with my son. when i asked for the money for the lawyer, i started getting some push-back from my brother. am i sure this lawyer can help? he wants to talk to this lawyer. he does not like this lawyer. and eventually he refused all together to give me any money at all.  
through text messages one night my brother told me that i did not deserve to get visitation with my son back. that i am a piece of s\*\*\* dr\*g addict who abandoned her child in the first place and i did not deserve to see my child. that because my friend L paid for my house, it was not my money in the first place so i did not deserve to have it back. that he was a struggling father trying to provide for his family, so he deserved the money more. he only has $20,000 in his savings and he cannot afford to give me the money to get visitations with my son. etc.  
3 months later, he bought himself a brand new car... i can only assume with my money.

i have been out of prison now for 4 years. i have tried to find lawyers to take on my case in order to try to get my money back from my brother, but every lawyer wanted money up front to take my case, which i have not been able to afford.  
my husband reconnected with a friend he has had since high school. his friend's father is a lawyer, and he has decided to take on my case with the few thousand dollars i have managed to save. while he was speaking to me about my case, he told me that theft is theft and that i needed to report this theft to the sheriffs office.   
i am torn. for one, i know what the prisons are like out here, and while they are not as ""political"" as other state's prisons, i do know what the male prisons are like out here, and i do not want to subject my brother to that. i am told that the monetary amount my brother has taken from me is grand theft and he could potentially spend years behind bars. for two, i believe my brother is the primary source of income in his household, and while his wife does work (now) she would not be able to afford the mortgage payments on her own. she would lose the house, and so would his three children. he would not be the only one punished for this. not only that but he would lose his job at the post office for even the allegations of these charges.  
i feel like his wife may be innocent in this whole thing, but at the same time, she knows that i want my money back as well and she has not even offered to try to pay me back either. i have not even heard so much as a ""thank you"" from her nor my brother for even buying the house.

i am tired of being scr\*wed over for helping people. i really thought that if i helped my brother we would have a better relationship. that he would see me as valuable for once, that i would matter. i never thought that he would take my money and run. 

i feel so betrayed and worthless for all of this. i don't know what i did to deserve this? i know that i may not have always been the best person when i was using, but i have never stolen from my brother, never did anything like this or for him to do this to me...

so, would i be the a\*\*hole for reporting this to the police and filing theft charges against my brother for stealing the money he received for the sale of my house?",1,1755915785.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

Today included my regular 110 mile round-trip through Seattle and Tacoma for a painful 2-hour medical appointment and then the return trip through the two most congested metro areas in the state during Friday rush hour.

   I've had three friends call in crisis today - something that doesn't usually happen.  One of those calls was more important than me completing an important bit of paperwork this morning that I'm behind on or having breakfast.  Another was from a friend who just discovered his mom has cancer that sidetracked lunch.  My dad is in really poor health; it's a miracle he's lived this long but I call every day, twice a day - at 8:30 am and 5:40 pm his time to check in and tell him I love him.  Been doing that since the day my step mom died at 5:40 pm 19 years ago this month.  He waits for my call and today he didn't pick up.  Every 15-minutes for 75-minutes and finally a quick, ""Can I talk in the morning?"" and he was gone.  He didn't even have the strength to pretend he was okay.  Then my exit arrives and on to the grocery store.

  I'm a 60-year-old non-passing trans woman.  I'm a disabled autistic woman with ADHD who was overwhelmed, overstimulated, hadn't gotten to eat all day and so far past my limits that I found myself stopped in the grocery store trying to remember what I was there for.  I heard someone call out to get my attention and looked in the direction the sound came from.  I was wrong; it wasn't my attention she was looking for - it was her husbands.  Just as I turned her way she jabbed a thumb in my direction rolled her eyes and snorted derisively.  It wasn't meant for me to see but I did and she turned to face me, disgust written all over her face.  I froze for half a second and then smiled the most genuine smile I had all day.

   Her husband closed the distance in that second and challenged me, ""You got something to say?""  I nodded and turned to his wife, ""Thank you, ma'am.""  Honestly, I would have let it go right there but they both looked at me like I was being sarcastic or making fun of them so I continued, ""It's been a day and I had forgotten who I am.  My first though was so out of character for me it got my attention and reminded me that I'm a child of God and such thoughts are not worthy of me.  That thought fixed my day so again, thank you.""

   I am privileged to live in a place where that kind of intolerance doesn't happen often so I've got more reserves than most when it comes up, I think.  I missed a couple meals today because my friends and loved ones trust me enough to reach out when they need an ear or some guidance.  I've had so many years with my father that his lifestyle should of robbed us both of.  I have a car after 27 months without and can afford car insurance and gas to get to my medical appointments that I'm fortunate enough to have insurance to pay for.  I missed two meals because I didn't have time - not because I didn't have food.  I forgot all that today and an angel masquerading as a Trump supporter showed up to remind me.

We're two friends who decided to skip the funding chase and bootstrap our way into SaaS Probably not the smartest move, but it feels right for us.

Right now, 

* We're company bootstrapped (read: broke).
* We've made $0 in revenue so far.
* Everyone tells us to focus on one thing only -- but we're stubbornly trying two.

Why post here?

Because we don't just want to shout ""look at our product"". We want to share our journey -- wins, screwup, and lessons -- with people who've been in the trenches or are just starting out.

Some quick facts:

* First beta users? Half of them ghosted.
* First launch? Crickets.
* Biggest lesson? Building is easy, distribution is nightmare.
* Why keep going? because even with $0 revenue, we're learning like crazy and having fun.

We're here to:

* Share what we’re learning (cold emails, pricing experiments, user churn, all of it).
* Learn from this community (what you’d do differently if you were us).
* Hopefully make some connections with other bootstrappers who know this pain.

So that’s us. Two stubborn founders, two risky products, zero funding, and probably way too much coffee ☕.

One small thing that’s helped me stay accountable is using [Soberpath](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/soberpath/id6746735408). The streak tracking keeps me grounded, but honestly the resources and the supportive community within the app have been just as helpful when I’ve felt shaky.

A while ago I started developing peripheral neuropathy, brain fog and severe migraines. After a bunch of tests, it turns out the cause was vitamin B6 toxicity from drinking 2 cans of Red Bull every day for over a year.

I just got my blood work back and my doctor told me to completely avoid any energy drinks with B6 in them. Since stopping suddenly, though, I’ve been feeling really anxious, depressed, experiencing depersonalization and having even worse migraines.

Has anyone else experienced withdrawal-type symptoms after stopping B6 suddenly following toxicity? And is there anything that helps? I’ve still been drinking coffee, so I don’t think it’s a caffeine thing.",1,1755915690.0,B6Toxicity,0,1.0,False

I tried dating apps before but women I've met there have no substance (in my personal experience) and very boring to talk to. I'm willing to travel to your area but as long as it's NOT far away than Manila or Quezon City Area. If you're in Pangasinan or Tarlac area, for example, that's totally good.

**For both of our safety**: Let's share pictures of each other in DMs for our intros. Just for both of us to be sure that we can trust each other. If we're attracted to each other at first glance, let's give it a shot and get to know each other. Don't worry, I will NOT be asking for NSFW photos or videos of you, and please don't ask me for those as well. Simply SFW pictures ONLY. To me, it's much better if we're BOTH attracted to each other in the beginning so there's spark to continue further. That ""Spark"" and initial attraction is important for the both of us. This is also to filter out scammers and frauds out there.

1mxphun,https://www.reddit.com/r/mystery/comments/1mxphun/is_my_job_haunted/,Is my job haunted?,"I recently got a job at my local blood bank (Carter BloodCare). While in NEO, we took a tour of the building; about halfway through, you can tell a notable shift in the building's architecture. Our tour guide told the NEO group that this was due to the current building (Carter BloodCare HQ) having been built onto a preexisting abandoned mental hospital (with a padded room still intact). Now I'm not one to believe in paranormal activity or ghosts, but when my guide half-jokingly said that some employees think the building is haunted, I could tell she wasn't just half joking. Now I've only been here a week so far, but I already got the consensus from other employees that they truly think this building is haunted. I naturally just dismissed this to old-timers trying to pull my leg until I went into the employee lounge to get a cup of coffee and the kitchen sink's handle raised on its own and turned on. I know it wasn't in my head since there was another employee in there with me and she was a witness, it most definitely wasn't her since we where both on the other side of the room. Now I'm just curious as to if this building really was a psychiatric facility or if this entire thing was some kind of elaborate hoax since im a new guy? Reddit do your thing here's the adress...

In the beginning, it seemed innocent she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. It felt simple… harmless even. But over time, things started to feel… off.

One day, we had a video call. She didn’t want to turn on her camera, saying her hair was “messy.” Actually, she never wanted to show her face. Later, she told me she had autism according to her, at least.

Our conversations were mostly one-sided. I was always putting in the effort.

We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled last minute, saying she hurt her leg. Then she started opening up about how her ex abandoned her, how she dated another guy who dumped her, and how she felt constantly rejected.

At that point, I still wanted to be there for her… until the day I got mugged and almost lost her number. She didn’t care. She acted completely indifferent and even said:

> “I won’t text you if you don’t text me.”



That was a red flag, but I ignored it.

She’d talk about her cats, her nephews who also had autism, and once she got furious because her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex. Her emotions flipped constantly like a switch.

Eventually, I invited her to the movies, since she always complained we never went out. At first, she said no because she was “too shy.” Then she agreed. But the next day, right before the date, she suddenly dropped:

 “Maybe we should just be friends?”


Still, we went. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the movie, spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. It felt nice  until I realized she wouldn’t let me look at her phone. She refused to give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me a chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was “too shy” and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine… but suddenly, she snapped and her mood flipped again.

We went to the park another day, spent some time together, and when she was heading home, I decided to walk her there. That’s when I noticed something strange she was making it obvious she didn’t want me to meet her family.

Later, her sister once drove her to my place. I made a small joke about how we never went out because she was always “making excuses.” She blew up on me that day.

We played a game together once, I criticized it lightly, and she got mad, stopped playing entirely. Then she brought me chocolate… only to ask for a breakup right after.

She invited me to a party once, then changed her mind, then said she wanted me there again. I got frustrated and asked if she even wanted me around. She said yes, but made it very clear I couldn’t arrive before 6 PM.

I showed up a bit early anyway. Her sister saw me and asked me to come upstairs. We ended up going to her friend’s party together, and there, she introduced me as her boyfriend. I thought, “Finally, some clarity.” But then, out of nowhere, she turned to me and said:

""Should we download a dating app to find you a hot girl?""


I laughed awkwardly, but deep down, I was confused as hell.

Later that night, she wanted me to sleep over. I went home instead. Things started spiraling from there.

After all the mixed signals, I eventually called her and broke up. She started crying, blocked me everywhere, then sent me a long message saying I “sent her to a mental clinic” and “stole her happiness.”

Then… a few days later, she messaged me again, saying she missed me more than she thought she would. Against my better judgment, we started talking again.

And that’s when I found her on a dating app.

When I confronted her, she claimed she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I didn’t buy it. I got angry, but in the end… I still told her I loved her.

She said she was at a place and wished I was there. Later, she called me, inviting me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go.

The next day, her mom called me personally, asking if I really loved her daughter. Then she invited me for coffee.

We talked again, but soon she told me her dad was angry at me. I vented online about everything that had been happening… and she found my post.

She accused me of using her, lying to her, and manipulating her. Then she said she only acted that way because she was insecure, had autism, and prayed for me every single day.

Then she blocked me everywhere.
And just… disappeared.

So yung boyfriend ko na nakatira sa ibang bansa. Working student, matalino, magaling sa work niya. Mayaman na family nila sa Philippines pero they decided na mag ibang bansa. Eight years na kami together. Since he just graduated from his second bachelors degree (after taking so many certificate degree) at nag cum laude siya, he said he wanted to invite me sa country nila. I applied, I got denied kasi lately may mass deportation sila. Naghigpit so we decided na mag vacation sa ibang bansa. 

I insisted on spending equally pero ayun nga, nabilhan niya na ko ng ticket, hotel rooms are booked, even the attractions and everything na gagawin namin booked and paid na. The day of the flight, last minute he told me na mauna sa loob ng airport may sasabihin lang kay dad. Turns out he told dad na magpropropose siya. 


Our stay abroad is okay naman no away and honestly, it was one of the best vacation I had kasi he catered it to what we both want. Sobrang princess treatment ko that time. Never nagbuhat ng luggage, laging pinapaupo sa train seat kahit pagod kami pareho, he gives me the last bite if he knows na gusto ko food. And the occasional ice cream and coffee stops. 

He proposed. Hired a camera man, kami na we’re wearing traditional clothes nung country na pinuntahan namin. I was overjoyed. I saw the ring and was shook too. Sabi ko nga sakanya kahit cheese ring I’d say yes pero the ring is gold band, 3 carat diamond na natural, not lab grown. 

We continued the trip, okay naman no problem at all. Paguwi dun nag simula. My parents unhappy with the pasalubongs. My lola looking down on what we got her. Given na pareho kaming panganay ni fiancé parang coded na kami to do better and to suck it up, na iplease nalang next time which infuriated me kasi wala ginawa yung pamilya ko but magparinig saying kuripot fiancé ko. Wherein in fact nagiipon siya for our separate house sa ibang bansa and tuition for my career advancement. Bagot na bagot ako.

Alt text: Professional business people in a modern corporate meeting room. company in the Bahrain Financial Harbour. The sun sparkled on the Gulf, and I watched as suit-clad founders gathered in Seef District cafés, closing deals over local qahwa. Since then, I’ve guided dozens of ventures—tech startups in Bahrain Bay, family offices in the Diplomatic Area, and everything in between—through the maze of Bahraini company requirements.\
I’ve seen founders waste valuable hours at the MOICT waiting desk, miss deadlines during Ramadan, and scramble over last-minute director documentation. But I’ve also seen the right preparation result in new companies launching in as little as two weeks—sometimes less—simply by following local customs and using insider shortcuts.\
This guide distills everything you need to know about director requirements for a WLL in Bahrain—mixed with firsthand tips, the latest 2025 regulatory changes, and strategic guidance on getting your business set up faster and smarter.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: The Advantage\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain’s non-oil GDP growth ticked up to 2.5% in Q1 2025, with new digital and fintech investments flooding into Bahrain Bay and the Seef District. Forbes Business recently ranked Bahrain in the Gulf’s top three for ease of doing business, driven by its liberal ownership laws and nimble regulatory bodies.\
Key insights from 2025:\
- 99% foreign ownership for most business activities—see this guide\
- Digital-first government processes: Sijilat (the national company portal) processes most applications online, reducing approval times to under 15 business days\
- Tamkeen grants help with staff training and company development\
- Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area remain prime locations, while Seef’s new coworking zones offer great value for startups\
According to Bahrain.com, over 1,500 new commercial registrations (CRs) were filed in Q1 2025, with the WLL company structure accounting for almost 60% of all new entities. This trend is no accident—WLLs offer unique advantages for foreign founders and family offices alike.\
\
Understanding Bahrain WLL Companies\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
* Minimum one director required\
* No local sponsor mandatory unless dictated by specific sector regulations\
* Separate legal entity—personal assets are shielded from business liabilities\
* No mandatory minimum capital for most activities (except select sectors like banking or insurance)\
For a full comparison with other legal structures, including SPC, BSC, and branch offices, check this resource.\
\
Anecdote: My first WLL registration was for a digital agency in the Seef District. With only two expatriate partners and one director, we got fully set up, licensed, and operating in just 18 working days. The key? All director paperwork was impeccably scanned and pre-authenticated before ever stepping into the MOICT.\
\
\
Bahrain WLL Company: Who Can Be a Director?\
Core Legal Requirements (2025 Update)\
\
Minimum: 1 Director (can be a shareholder or external appointment)\
Residency: Director can be any nationality; Bahrain residence is not mandatory. However, if you want to sponsor work visas quickly, appointing a Bahrain-resident director is strongly recommended for the first year.\
Age Limit: Minimum age is 18; no upper limit\
Corporate Directors: Not allowed—only actual persons eligible\
\
\
Importantly, a new policy from MOICT effective April 2025 now requires directors to complete a digital KYC (Know Your Customer) check via Sijilat before CR issuance. This replaced the previous in-person signature requirement, saving tons of time.\
\
Common Practice\
Most WLLs in Bahrain operate perfectly well with just one director who is also a shareholder. However, for credibility (particularly with banks), I recommend having at least two directors—ideally one with a Bahrain CPR (Central Population Registry) card. This helps with account openings and LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) filings, especially if you need expat work visas.\
Local tip: Opt for a director who is based in Bahrain even part-time. Dealing with government departments—especially during Ramadan or national holidays—can be a headache if your only director is out of the country. (I once had to fly a director in from London just to sign a last-minute bank document at Arab Banking Corporation.)\
\
Director Documentation: Insider Shortcuts & Practical Advice\
!(\
- Certified passport copy (for non-GCC nationals, notarized and attested if applying from abroad)\
- Recent colored passport-size photo\
- Up-to-date CV or professional profile\
- CPR card (if Bahraini or resident director)\
- KYC digital submission via Sijilat\
- No-objection letter (if director is employed elsewhere in Bahrain—rarely requested, but best to prepare)\
Time-saving shortcut: Always check with your commercial registration agent or use a trusted service provider—the best will pre-scan and verify your documents, so you don’t waste time at the MOICT counter (located in the Diplomatic Area, ground floor, Sijilat helpdesk). The busiest times? Sunday and Tuesday mornings—avoid these at all costs. Instead, file after 2pm on weekdays or during Ramadan’s extended evening hours.\
\
My biggest headache? The first time I tried to submit digitally, I used a photo of my CV taken on my phone—Sijilat flagged it for poor quality, setting me back a week. Now, I always use a print shop in Seef Mall for professional scans—problem solved.\
\
\
The 2025 Regulatory Change: What’s Different Now?\
Bahrain’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOICT) implemented several updates in early 2025:\
\
Mandatory digital KYC for all directors: Physical passport copies and wet signatures are out—Sijilat’s new online upload and verification tool is in.\
Director criminal background check: Now required only for “sensitive” activities (finance, banking, fintech, health, education). For most sectors, standard ID and digital KYC is enough.\
Updated director declaration: From June 2025, directors must sign a digital declaration on Sijilat, confirming no previous business bans in Bahrain or GCC.\

\
Step-by-Step Process: Appointing Directors and Registering a WLL\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.**\
   * Decide on one or more directors. For visa and banking ease, include a local resident if possible.\
2. Prepare Documentation\
   * Ensure all scans are clear, color, and professionally done. Use a business center or print shop in Diplomatic Area or Seef for best results.\
3. Sijilat Pre-Submission\
   * Pre-load all documentation onto Sijilat gov portal. Complete digital KYC, passport upload, and personal data submission.\
4. MOICT Digital Review\
   * The MOICT team reviews applications within 5 business days for standard sectors. Finance, insurance, or regulated industries may require 2-3 weeks for director clearance.\
5. CR Issuance\
   * Upon approval, the Commercial Registration (CR) is issued, listing your directors and shareholdings. This document is your license to operate.\
6. Open Bank Account\
   * Use your new CR, director list, and KYC clearances to open an account. Local banks (Ahli United, Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait) often require one director to be present in-person.\
Key tip: If opening in Bahrain Bay or Seef, book early morning appointments to avoid lunchtime queues—especially critical during Ramadan adjusted hours (10am-3pm).\
For a detailed process walkthrough, see company formation process in Bahrain.\
\
WLL Company Formation Costs: Budgeting Smartly\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
- Commercial Registration (CR): BHD 50–100 annually, activity-dependent\
- Professional Service Fees: Budget BHD 450-900 for a reliable service provider managing end-to-end setup—for the best value, see cost breakdown\
- Office Lease (virtual): Hotdesk/virtual options start as low as BHD 30/month in Seef coworking hubs; physical offices in Bahrain Bay/Diplomatic Area range from BHD 150-350/month for small units\
\
And don’t forget: Tamkeen can subsidize part of your startup costs if you’re a Bahraini national or have a Bahraini partner.\
\
Budget hack: Registering in a designated Bahrain Free Zone can significantly reduce annual licensing and director visa costs, particularly for logistics and tech companies.\
\
Ownership, Control, and Local Sponsorship: What You Need to Know\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.). No local sponsor is generally needed, except in select activities like certain building trades or government procurement (where local sponsorship rules might apply).\
Directors are the company’s legal managers—not “sponsors” or silent partners as in the UAE or Saudi Arabia. They sign contracts, hold board meetings (often majlis-style over coffee), and manage the CR. A director does not have to be a shareholder but does have a big say in day-to-day decisions.\
\
In contrast with Dubai, where local sponsorship can dominate company control, Bahrain’s WLL system gives you real operational independence.\
\
\
Ongoing Compliance: Director’s Role Post-Formation\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. for peace of mind)\
- Attending annual board meetings (can be virtual, but in-person preferred for major changes)\
- Approving employment contracts, LMRA visa sponsorship requests, and banking transactions\
Surprisingly, directors in Bahrain are typically involved in informal networking and relationship-building—think business breakfasts at Mövenpick Seef or coffee in Adliya’s boutique lounges. This helps with government relations and accelerates approvals (yes, even in the digital age!).\
\
Tangent: One underrated custom: always serve Arabic coffee and sweets during business meetings with local partners or government officials. It’s a small gesture but signals respect for tradition—something that helped me win key allies at the EDB during my own registration.\
\
A common mistake? Relying entirely on remote directors located abroad. If government bodies can’t reach a director for signature or clarification, your company risks unwanted delays or even penalties.\
\
Real-World Example: How I Solved a Director Issue\
A client of mine wanted to appoint a UK-based director, but every time the MOICT needed a document signed, it led to a courier chase—weeks lost. The fix? We added a part-time Bahrain-resident as co-director (a trusted lawyer recommended by a former client), and delegated routine paperwork to him. The UK director retained strategic oversight but avoided time-wasting administrative bottlenecks.\
My advice: always keep a local or easily reachable director on file. Use virtual board meetings when needed, but have one foot on the ground in Bahrain for smooth running.\
\
Why WLL Directors Matter: Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia\
Bahrain’s system is much more flexible:\
- No legal requirement for a local Emirati or Saudi as director\
- Lower cost, faster digital setup\
- Greater foreign control over operations and profit distribution\
But—be wary of “silent nominee” directors. MOICT has stepped up audits and background checks in 2025; your appointed director must actively participate and sign official documents.\
\
Best Resources, Providers, and Insider Tips\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. is consistently reliable.\
Insider tip: Arrive at government offices outside of peak hours (avoid 10am Sunday and Tuesday). For urgent queries, develop a relationship with Sijilat or MOICT desk staff—drop in with a box of local sweets, and you’ll be amazed at the help you receive.\
\
Director Requirements for a WLL: Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them\
\
Submitting low-quality document scans—use a professional service every time\
Failing to check director availability for KYC and Sijilat digital signatures\
Appointing only non-resident directors—leads to major banking and visa headaches\
Neglecting annual director declarations since the June 2025 policy update\
\
Always pre-check MOICT holidays and adjust for shorter Ramadan hours. And remember—relationships matter: Bahrain’s business world runs on a mix of digital efficiency and traditional respect.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain WLL Director Requirements\
Q1: Can a WLL director be non-resident and non-Bahraini?\
Yes. Directors can be any nationality and do not need to reside in Bahrain, but it’s best to have at least one director on the ground for practical reasons. More details.\
Q2: Is there a minimum capital for appointing directors in a WLL?\
No, except in regulated sectors (banking, insurance). For most activities, there’s no required minimum share capital. See entity types explained.\
Q3: Do directors need to provide a police clearance certificate?\
Only if your WLL is in a regulated industry (finance, health, education); otherwise, standard passport and KYC is enough.\
Q4: What’s the cost for appointing multiple directors?\
Each additional director’s KYC costs BHD 20; overall setup budget for a standard WLL (including all fees and professional support) ranges from BHD 450-900. See the latest cost breakdown.\
Q5: Who can help with director compliance and accounting?\
Use a Bahrain-based accounting provider for reliable compliance—outsourcing saves time and avoids mistakes.\

The Cleveland Guardians, currently batting .172 in the clutch (and apparently in every other situation), will face the Texas Rangers, who are somehow still relevant despite a 63-66 record. The Rangers are favored at **-145**, which translates to a **60% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s about the same chance I have of not spilling coffee on my keyboard while writing this.

**Why the Rangers Should Win:**  
Nathan Eovaldi, the Rangers’ starter, is a human embodiment of “ace,” with an **11-3 record, 1.76 ERA, and 0.870 WHIP**. He’s so good, he’s basically a spreadsheet that walks, pitches, and occasionally smiles. Meanwhile, Cleveland’s Slade Cecconi is… not. His **4.50 ERA** and **1.7 HRs per 9 innings** (the highest in the league) make him the kind of pitcher who’d probably hit a home run if he swung a bat. The Guardians’ offense, ranked **17th in wRC+ post-All-Star break**, is about as threatening as a toddler with a training wheel.

**Why the Guardians Might Win:**  
They could, I guess, if the Rangers’ bullpen implodes. But the Rangers

1mxp8j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mxp8j9/he_was_the_good_boy/,He was the Good Boy,"My name is Nora. I’m twenty-three, which is old enough to know better but still too young to actually do better. I moved to Lakeford last spring and took a job answering phones at a property management office. It pays the bills, and the air conditioner wheezes along just well enough to keep me from melting in the summer.

My nights are all the same: microwave dinners, collapsing on the couch, scrolling my phone until the blue light burns holes into my eyes. 

A few Saturdays ago, my roommates dragged me out of the apartment. “Dragged” is the right word. Kelsey and Brooke had already decided we were going out, and I was the cargo they had to haul.

The place was called The Boat-House. The name made it sound quaint, like somewhere you’d drink lemonade with your grandmother, but really it was wedged between a pawn shop and a tax office on Main. The entire block pulsed with bass and car exhaust.

Inside, the floor stuck to my shoes. Mason-jar lights dangled like drunk fireflies over the tables, and a chalkboard sagged above the bar with drink specials written in fat bubble letters. Everything was loud, hot, and ordinary. 

Safe enough.

I’m not built for crowds. I stuck to the wall like a damp leaf, holding my phone up as camouflage, pretending I had an urgent text from someone who didn’t exist.

Kelsey and Brooke were already two rounds in, shrieking with laughter, waving at me to join them on the dance floor. They looked like they belonged. I looked like someone trying not to be mistaken for a lost child.

So I clung to my drink.

When my friends ducked into the restroom, he slid into their space.

“Move over, sweetheart.”

He didn’t wait. He carved out space with his body, his size filling the air. Tall, shoulders squared like a fighter, hair clipped sharp like a catalog model. Shirt tight across muscle. The smell of soap and aftershave sliced through the swamp of spilled beer.

I edged an inch to the side. “I’m waiting for my friends.”

He flicked his eyes toward the restroom line. “Those two? They’ll be a while.” He drummed a finger against my glass. “What’s this?”

“Peach mule.”

“Cute,” he drawled. The word dangled in the air, smug and rough. Then he added, “Let me get you a real drink.”

“No thanks.” I shifted half around, a motion that should have ended things. It didn’t. He stayed planted, close enough that if I tried to leave I’d brush against him.

“Come on,” he coaxed, his smile sharpened thin. “Don’t be rude. I’m being friendly.”

“You’re blocking me in,” I said.

His smile changed like a door slamming shut. Quick. Cold. “I like to see what I’m buying.” His gaze crawled down my body, then back up, unhurried as a hand. “You come here often, Nora?”

My stomach knotted so hard it made me want to bend over. I hadn’t told him my name.

“Smile for me,” he said.

“No.”

That word landed like a stone dropped in water. His expression wavered, not anger but disappointment, as if he’d practiced a trick and I’d ruined the ending. He rolled his shoulders, leaning in, trying to loom taller than the room would let him.

“You don’t know me,” he said. His tone suggested that was a problem I ought to solve.

Before I could answer, someone else slipped into the space. Not loud. Not aggressive. Just present. Same height. Same eyes. Same face. For one dizzy second the world doubled, like I was looking through a warped mirror.

Twins.

“Stop,” the new one said. His voice was steady, the kind of steady that makes you want to trust it. “You’re scaring her.”

“I’m talking,” the first one snapped.

“You’re going too far.” The second one’s voice didn’t rise, but the weight in it carried. He turned to me for half a beat, and something in his face made the air feel easier. “I’m sorry. He does this.”

“I do what?” The first barked a laugh. “I’m being nice.”

“Your nice has teeth,” the second said. His tone dropped lower. “Walk.”

“You’re not my keeper.”

“Walk,” he repeated, softer, but with an edge that caught.

They stood squared, like warped reflections in a funhouse mirror. One rigid as steel rebar, the other loose, coiled, as if he could move either way. For one heartbeat I braced for fists to fly. Instead, the first clicked his tongue, shot me a glare, and dissolved back into the crowd.

The second stayed in place until his brother was fully gone, swallowed by the press of bodies. Only then did he step back, just enough that I could breathe again.

He let a breath slip from his lips. His voice was normal now, and tired. “He’s drunk. I should’ve stepped in sooner.”

“I’m fine.” My voice cracked. I cleared my throat and tried again. “Thanks.”

“Do you want some space? I can stick around, make sure he doesn’t circle back until your friends return.”

“That’s nice of you.” I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over the rideshare app. “I think I’m going to head out.”

He nodded, like he understood. “Good idea.”

We stood in the kind of silence that should have been awkward but wasn’t. He kept his hands at his sides, no reaching, no angling in closer. He didn’t ask for my number. His eyes kept moving, sweeping the crowd like a guard dog watching over his pack.

“Does he do this a lot?” I asked finally. My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

“Often enough,” he said. “He thinks if he pushes long enough, the world just tips his way. Sometimes he’s right.” He shook his head. “Still not an excuse.”

“I don’t like being cornered.” The words slipped out sharp.

His mouth pressed thin. “I’m sorry you had to deal with him.”

Before I could answer, Kelsey appeared in a rush, cheeks bright red from laughing or liquor, with Brooke trailing like a kite tail behind her. “We’re closing out,” she announced, then squinted at me. “Are you okay? That guy looked like a total jerk.”

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, holding up my phone. “Calling a car.”

“I’ll wait with you,” the twin offered. He didn’t say it to me so much as he said it to my friends, like he was asking permission. “Just until it arrives.”

Kelsey narrowed her eyes, half protective, half nosy. “Do you know him?”

“No,” I said. Then I realized I wanted too. “But he’s okay.”

Something eased in his face, and he gave a small smile, the kind that tugged only one corner of his mouth. “I’ll stay five feet back. Scouts honor.”

We stepped outside into a wall of summer air, damp and sticky, the kind that clings to your skin like an unwanted hug. Smoke from someone’s cigarette curled across the sidewalk, blending with the tang of car exhaust. From across the street came the sound of a man juggling while a woman filmed him, her laughter drifting over traffic. 

“Text me when you get home,” Kelsey said, giving my shoulder a squeeze.

“I will,” I promised.

Then they were gone, back into the bar, their laughter swallowed by music. My app said seven minutes until my ride. 

“Again, I’m sorry about my brother,” he said. His voice had a weight to it, like this wasn’t the first apology he’d given. “It isn’t your job to deal with him.”

“It shouldn’t be yours either,” I said.

That got a laugh from him. “Somebody has to. He hunts for reactions. If he doesn’t get one, he just pushes harder.”

Then headlights swept over us. My ride. He stepped forward and opened the back door, then backed away again as if to prove he wasn’t going to press his luck.

“Thank you,” I said.

“Get home safe.”

I paused, one hand on the door. “What’s your name?”

He hesitated. “Cal.”

“I’m Nora.”

“It was nice to meet you, Nora.” The words came out awkward, as if he wasn’t used to meeting people.

“Can I give you my number?” he asked. His voice was careful, almost apologetic. “No pressure. Block me if you want.”

He said it like a hook, not a line. I held out my phone. He typed quickly, then stopped, hesitating. “Maybe I shouldn’t. I don’t want to push you.”

“It’s fine,” I said. “I asked your name, didn’t I?”

That coaxed the number onto the screen. He handed the phone back, watching me like I might suddenly regret it.

“I’ll head back inside after you go,” he said. “I don’t want to see my brother right now.”

“You don’t like him much.”

“I love him,” Cal answered, his voice gravel. “I just don’t like who he is when he’s prowling.”

That word lingered like smoke in my ear long after the car door shut.

At home, I sent two quick texts: one to Kelsey, one to him. *Made it. Thanks.*

His reply came back almost instantly. *Awesome, sleep well*

And that was all.

Two Saturdays later, just past noon, my phone lit up.

*Do you like tacos.*

The period at the end felt deliberate, like he had thought about it too much. I stared at the screen, amused and oddly nervous, then answered yes. A moment later he sent the name of a place on River Street, the kind with big windows that stared straight at the water. Seven o’clock.

I showed up early, because that is what I do, and lingered outside longer than I needed. The glass reflected my own face back at me, pale and uncertain, before I pushed inside.

He was already there. No grand gesture, no fake surprise, only a small wave, like he wasn’t entirely sure I’d come. His shirt was clean, plain jeans, and a baseball cap folded neatly on the seat beside him.

When I reached the table, he stood quickly and pulled out my chair, then looked embarrassed for it.

“I don’t go out much,” he admitted. “But I figured you’d be hungry.”

“I’m always hungry,” I said. That, at least, was true.

The air smelled of lime and fryer oil. My stomach growled in appreciation.

We ordered, and while we waited, he asked about my job. I told him the usual: broken water heaters, angry tenants, endless paperwork. Then I added how last week the office printer and fax machine had both died on the same day. My boss, who barely knew which end of a screwdriver to hold, was helpless. So I bought myself a little multi-tool keychain.

I showed him how the screwdriver folded out, gleaming in the restaurant light, and told him how it saved me from three hours of calling tech support.

“You carry that everywhere?” he asked.

“Now I do.”

His smile came fast and genuine.

I asked him about his life, the kind of questions that felt safe but still personal. He said he worked at a gym and helped coach high school wrestlers when the season rolled around. 

Then his phone buzzed on the table. He didn’t glance at it, only turned it face down like it might glare back.

“You can answer,” I said, thinking maybe it was important.

“It’s fine. Just Rhett.”

“Your brother?”

His mouth tightened. It wasn’t much, but enough to see. He gave a single nod. “Yeah.”

The food came then, mercifully, a pair of plates steaming with tacos. He attacked his with lime and hot sauce until the tortillas sagged under the weight. I laughed after my first bite sent half the filling sliding onto the plate in disgrace.

He wordlessly passed me a napkin, his mouth tugging into a crooked half-smile.

We swapped scraps of history. I told him about the town I grew up in, where the summer festival was just a parade of tractors dressed up with crepe paper. He chuckled, said he’d moved a lot as a kid. He didn’t offer reasons, and I didn’t press. 

His phone buzzed again, rattling faintly against the wood. This time he looked.

G.Boy: *Where are you*G.Boy: *Pick up*G.Boy: *We had plans*G.Boy: *Are you with her*

Cal locked the screen fast.

“Does he always talk to you like that?” I asked.

“When he’s been drinking,” Cal said, his face flashing regret like a ripple in water. “Sorry. Shouldn’t drag family stuff onto a date.”

“You didn’t,” I told him. “He did.”

That earned me a flicker of a smile before he pressed the phone face down again, the way you’d close a book you were tired of reading.

We lingered long after the plates had been cleared, until the waitress wiped every other table around us and began stacking chairs.

When the check came, he signed it without even glancing at the total. His fingers drummed the pen against the slip of paper, quick and restless, as if he were working up to a confession.

“I don’t want to go home tonight,” he said at last.

I thought about my own apartment. Kelsey and Brooke were probably already half-drunk with their music blasting, questions waiting like knives left out on the counter. The thought made me bold.

“We don’t have to go back to mine either,” I said. The words startled me even as they came out. “Why don’t we… go somewhere else? Maybe find a movie. In a room. Just us.” I caught his eyes and shrugged, as if to soften the suggestion.

For the first time that night his face lit up, sudden and boyish, like sunlight spilling over a wall. It pulled a laugh from me before I could stop it.

“Then yeah,” he said. “If you’re sure.”

“I’m sure.”

We drove in his truck with the windows cracked, warm air rushing in. The radio hummed soft. A pawprint bandanna dangled from the rearview mirror, fluttering like a tired flag every time the wind slipped in.

At the hotel desk he glanced at me first, waiting for the smallest nod before he asked for a room. The clerk didn’t bother to look up, just slid a keycard across the desk.

The room itself had the kind of characterless personality all hotel rooms share. A window that stared straight into the parking lot. A framed print of oranges in a bowl. He kicked off his shoes and sat gingerly on the edge of the bed, like he wasn’t sure if he should disturb the perfectly tucked blankets.

We turned on a movie and let it play in the background. He leaned back slowly, the tension in his shoulders easing the way ice cracks when spring finally warms the river.

When he reached for my hand, the touch was feather-light, as though he were asking a question instead of making a move.

“Stay,” he said. His voice was soft. “Only if you want to.”

“I want to.”

The kiss that followed was not cinematic. It was the kind of kiss two people share when they want the noise of the world to go away for a little while. He was careful, then not, the way care can slide so easily into hunger when you give yourself over to it. I won’t write the details. This isn’t that kind of forum, and it isn’t the point.

Later, much later, I woke in the dark to the blue blink of the cable box. His arm was heavy across my waist, the weight of it steady and anchoring. He slept the kind of sleep that looked earned, deep and unmoving.

My phone buzzed with a text from Kelsey: *Are you alive?*

I sent back a thumbs-up, then rolled my eyes. When I glanced at the dresser, Cal’s phone sat dark, a flat rectangle of trouble waiting to wake. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t need to. I already knew what would be waiting when he turned it back on.

In the morning, pale light slid through the curtains and turned the oranges in the framed print into little suns. He stretched, scrubbed a hand across his face and looked at me, not smiling exactly, but lighter than I had seen him before.

“You really are a sweetheart,” he said. His voice was deep, almost uncertain. Then, after a breath: “Can I see you again?”

I surprised myself by answering yes. The word came easier than I expected, like it had been waiting at the back of my throat all along.

Weeks passed, and we slipped into something that looked like dating even if neither of us named it. Coffee before my shift one morning, lukewarm and rushed but still enough to count. A walk by the river where the gnats glued themselves to our arms. I sent him pictures; he sent his own. Plain things. Good things. Quiet, no drama.

Then on Friday he texted: *Let me show you something, fresh start*

*Fresh start?* I typed back.

*From Rhett, I’m done picking up after him* 

The words hit me in the soft place under the ribs. *Okay,* I wrote. *I’ll be there.*

That night we sat on a bench by the river, sandwiches unwrapped on our laps. The water was the color of tea as the sun folded itself behind the warehouses. Cal kept studying my face like he was reading a gauge, and I only realized why when he reached out and brushed his thumb near my cheek. I’d been carrying a streak of mustard like a mask.

“I did it,” he said.

“Did what?”

“I’m not living with him anymore.”

“You moved?” The words tumbled out too fast, too eager.

“For now I’m on my boss’s couch. Nothing special, but Rhett doesn’t have a key.”

“He’ll be mad.”

“He already is. That’s not your problem.” His eyes stayed on mine. “I wanted you to know before we decide anything. I want to see where this goes.”

“I’d like that,” I said. “To see.”

His smile then was small, unpolished, but real.

“Fresh start?” he asked.

“Fresh start,” I echoed.

“Come on,” he said suddenly. “Let me show you my shop.”

“Your shop?”

“Technically my boss’s,” he admitted. “But after hours the bays are mine, as long as I keep the place clean.”

I blinked at him. “So you’re a wrestling coach and a mechanic?”

For just a second his expression faltered. A tiny pause, as if the question had thrown sand in his gears. Then something shifted behind his eyes, quick and hard to name, and he smoothed it away with a shrug.

“Yeah. Off-season,” he said, voice too casual. “Gives me a little more free time.” He tacked on a smile, easy and weightless.

The shop was tucked behind a row of storage units, their numbers painted on crooked like they had been added by a drunk with a brush. White siding scuffed from years of weather, the roll-up doors chained shut.

He flicked a switch inside. Rows of tube lights buzzed to life overhead, sputtering before they caught. 

“This is where you disappear to when you vanish on me?” I asked.

“It’s my therapy,” he said. His hand brushed the edge of a workbench. “Cheaper than the other kind.”

He led me past a Camaro on jack stands, its insides stripped bare. Next to it sat an old F100 in gray primer, the kind of truck that still remembered farm fields. Near the sink, a battered radio waited. He turned the dial, coaxing it to life, and soft vintage music spilled out. The sound felt too gentle for the shop, like lace in a barn.

“You do all this?” I trailed a finger over a door panel polished smooth as a seashell.

“With help,” he said. “I’m good at the boring parts. Now sit,” he said, patting the fender. “Tell me three things you’d do if money didn’t matter.”

The question caught me off guard. I thought for a moment. “I’d fix the dangling light in my apartment so it stops swinging every time the neighbors stomp upstairs. I’d learn how to make bread that doesn’t double as a brick. And…” My eyes swept over the rows of cars, parts scattered like puzzle pieces. “I’d buy a car that actually starts when I need it to.”

His grin came quick, flashing in the pale shop light. “We can handle one and three tonight.”

I laughed, shaking my head. “The bread’s still the dream. But I’ll settle for a car.”

“Then come with me.” Cal’s voice carried across the shop. He stood beside the Chevelle. “Pop the hood release on your side. We’ll pretend she’s yours.”

I tugged the handle and the hood rose slowly, creaking like something waking from a long nap. Cal leaned in with an ease that suggested this was his church and the engine his altar.

He pointed out belts, lines, reservoirs, explaining each one as if he were translating a foreign language. Complicated things became simple in his mouth, and the shop lights caught in his eyes as he bent closer.

I found myself watching him more than the machine. There was no show in it, no swagger. He wasn’t performing for me. He was sharing, and that was better.

Then the side door rattled.

Cal paused. “I locked that,” he murmured, the words meant more for himself than for me.

A second noise followed. The faint kiss of rubber on concrete. Then nothing.

“Probably a cat,” I offered. 

He didn’t answer. Instead, he moved forward, shoulders tight, angling his body so I was tucked behind him. His gaze fixed on the shadow pooled near the stacked tires.

“Stay here.”

“Cal-” I started, but he was already moving. His hand closed over a heavy flashlight on the bench, and with a sharp click he sent a beam cutting across the concrete.

Dust rose and sparkled in the light, like tiny insects caught in amber. The beam slid across crates, a blue tarp sagging over something bulky, the long metal leg of the lift.

Then something moved. A dart of black slipping fast between the cars.

Cal froze mid-step. I did too, every muscle in my body caught in that same stillness.

“Who’s there?” His voice had dropped, deep enough that the words seemed to drag along the floor.

The answer came in the form of a shape, peeling itself out of the shadow between the lifts.

It was tall. Broad. A mask covered its head. Nothing playful or cheap about it. Black leather formed into a snout, seams stitched tight like scars. Metal rings caught the flashlight beam, gleaming cold. Silver studs lined the jaw where teeth should have been, giving the illusion of a mouth that could never close.

It breathed, but the sound came out warped, dragged through rubber, rasping like air caught in a funnel.

Dog, but not a dog. Human, but not human.

The figure tilted its head, a slow, unnatural angle, as though considering which way to peel the skin from a problem. In one hand it gripped a wrench, short and heavy, its weight obvious even in the beam of the flashlight. The other hand dangled, loose and patient, as if waiting its turn.

“Rhett,” Cal said. The name left his mouth like a stone, heavy. “Take it off.”

The mask gave nothing back. But the body inside it moved.

He lunged forward, fast enough to blur. Cal’s hand caught mine, shoving me aside so hard my hip cracked against the corner of a bench.

“Behind me,” he snapped.

The figure kept advancing.

“Rhett,” Cal said again, his voice flat now, stripped of anything kind. “Take it off.”

The head tilt lingered, then the wrench lifted, and the figure closed the distance in a skater’s glide, smooth and practiced.

Cal met him in the middle. Metal struck with a sharp, ringing crack. The wrench smashed down on the flashlight, bursting its light in a single brittle pop that rattled my teeth. Cal threw his shoulder into the figure’s chest, driving with force enough to push him back two long steps, the rubber soles screeching over concrete like tires losing grip.

“Run!” Cal barked. His eyes never flicked from the figure. “Side door!”

My body moved before my brain caught up. I bolted, heart hammering, only to find a thick chain looped through the push bar. My stomach dropped so hard I thought I’d be sick. That chain hadn’t been there when we came in.

I clawed at the hook, fingers slipping, nails scraping against cold metal. It wouldn’t give. The door stayed stubborn and solid beneath my weight.

“Try the other door!” Cal’s voice was tight with effort. He was backing up toward the bay, his body a barrier between me and the mask.

I sprinted to the roll-up, seized the dangling chain, and hauled. It rattled in my palms, strong and thick. The door groaned, lifted an inch, then jammed with a violent shudder. The lock bars were still thrown.

Behind me the men moved in a circle, both predators. The masked figure feinted left, then darted right, fast as a snake. Cal tracked him step for step, the symmetry almost obscene, as if they’d rehearsed this dance a hundred times before.

“Top latches!” Cal shouted. “Both sides!”

I reached up, fingertips scraping cold metal until they caught the first latch. It gave with a stubborn click. I fumbled for the second, popped it free, and the door jolted upward.

I grabbed the chain and hauled. The door groaned and rose a little higher, half a foot maybe, before freezing in place. A slice of orange streetlight poured through the gap, narrow as a knife wound.

Dropping to my knees, I shoved my shoulder into the opening, grease smearing my shirt as I tried to wriggle under. The gap bit into my ribs. I couldn’t fit.

“Too small!” I gasped.

“Shit,” Cal snapped behind me.

The masked figure swung its head toward me. The silver studs lining its muzzle caught the light, sharp as fangs. Each breath rasped wet and hollow, the sound of something dragging air through broken plastic tubing.

“Eyes on me, Rhett,” Cal growled. The figure lunged toward him, swinging the wrench, and Cal slipped just out of reach.

“Office hall!” he barked, never looking at me. “Break room, past the soda machine!”

I spotted the hulking soda machine and lunged for the nearest door. It swung open into a cramped room: a scarred table, an old microwave, a corkboard cluttered with yellowed softball flyers. No exit.

“Keep moving, Nora! Door at the end!” Cal’s shout was closer now, ragged with strain.

My lungs burned, fire running up my throat as I shoved through a swinging gate and into a narrow aisle of shelves. Boxes and bins rose higher than my shoulders, each one labeled in blocky handwriting. Fuses. Hose clamps. Springs.

I turned left and spotted the gray door waiting at the very end of the aisle. My hand closed around the handle, slick with sweat, and I yanked it open with all the hope in the world that it led outside.

It didn’t.

The smell hit first. Bleach overlaid with something coppery, sharp as a coin pressed against water. 

The space was bare, windowless. A rolling stool stood crooked near the wall. In the center, a drain darkened the concrete. A pegboard hung heavy with tools, their outlines traced in black marker so no piece could ever go missing. On a shelf sat a pack of zip ties, a roll of duct tape, a tarp folded neatly.

And there, anchored dead-center, was a chair bolted into the floor.

Behind me, the latch gave a soft click.

I spun toward the doorway. Cal stood there, breath coming heavy, sweat darkening the collar of his shirt. For half a heartbeat I thought relief might flood me. Until his eyes caught mine and shifted. Not much. Just enough to tell me something was off.

“You made good time,” he said, letting out a breathless laugh that didn’t belong in the moment.

The hinges groaned again. Another figure shouldered past him. Rhett. The wrench dangled from his hand, tapping a lazy rhythm against his thigh. With one hand he dragged the mask halfway up, baring a grin underneath, wide and shining with spit.

“You should’ve seen your face,” he panted. “Perfect.”

My back hit the sheet wall before I even realized I was moving. “This isn’t funny,” I managed. “What the hell is this?”

“Oh, it’s hilarious,” Cal said. His grin was creeping wide, the kind boys wear when they’ve hidden in someone’s closet and can’t wait for the scream.

Rhett’s shoulders shook beneath his leather jacket. His voice came muffled but bright, like static through a speaker. “She’s great,” he said. “Better than the last one.”

“The last one?” My tone barely carried.

Cal tilted his head, studying me the way someone studies a caged animal they’ve spent weeks fattening up. “Yeah. It’s a family tradition. One of us plays the bad boy, the other plays the good boy. We take turns. Keeps things interesting.”

“Cal,” I said, my voice breaking around the name. I wanted it to matter. I wanted to believe if I said it enough times, the man who smiled shyly over tacos would step back into his skin. “You don’t have to do this.”

His answer was laughter, piercing and echoing, ricocheting off the metal walls like loose nails in a dryer. “Don’t have to?” he repeated, eyes wild with the joy of it. “Nora, this is what we do.” He craned his head, and the apology I’d once trusted was gone, burned out of him. “Don’t get me wrong. You’ve been fun.”

Rhett stepped forward, mask tugged low again, his voice slipping into a cartoon snarl. “But not as fun as what comes next.” He spread his arms wide, inviting the room to applaud. “Welcome to the show.”

Cal reached for the switch and slid the dimmer low. The light shrank until the corners of the room pressed in. “We like to give the full experience.”

Rhett moved in wide circles around me like a wolf testing the edge of the pen. He stopped beside the heavy chair planted in the center of the room and slapped the backrest with a flat crack of palm against metal. “She’ll look perfect right here, won’t she, Cal?” His head bobbed with a cocky rhythm as he leaned on the chair. “Tell me, Nora. What’s your favorite scary movie? How does it end?”

Cal’s eyes caught the thin light. “She likes happy endings,” he said. “That’s why she picked me.”

The two of them broke into a holler, the sound of boys who had found a new cruelty to share in.

I edged backward from the chair until my calves knocked into the lip of a rolling table. My hand slid over the surface, searching blindly, until it closed around something with weight. A screwdriver, long and solid.

Rhett noticed the shift in my eyes and wagged a gloved finger at me like I was a child reaching for a cookie jar. “Ah-ah. Hands where I can see them.”

“Let her take it,” Cal said. His voice was almost sweet.

I lifted the screwdriver, knuckles white around the handle. My hands looked steady. Or maybe I only prayed they did.

“Cal.” My grip tightened around the screwdriver. “Move.”

His mouth curved in something too sweet to be real. “We’re past that, Nora.”

I told myself I’d drive the blade into him if he got close enough. I told myself I’d be quick. He studied me a moment, then stepped forward, almost tenderly, like someone coaxing a child out of a tantrum.

“Go on,” Rhett urged, his voice a coaxing growl. “Do it. Stab him. He’s right there.”

I lunged. The screwdriver cut a straight line for Cal’s ribs. But he was faster. His hand snapped out, clamped around my wrist, and twisted until the pain screamed up my arm. My fingers betrayed me, opening on their own. The screwdriver clattered to the floor and rolled away.

“Atta girl!” Rhett barked through the mask, his gloved palms smacking together in a mockery of applause. “She really tried.”

Cal nudged the fallen screwdriver with the side of his boot and sent it skittering across the floor into shadow. “Knew you’d swing, Nora. Good for you.”

Before I could grab anything else, Rhett came in from the side like a bear lunging at its prey. His arms clamped around my ribs and lifted me as if I were nothing more than a doll. He slammed me down into the metal chair. The back of my skull smacked hard against the steel frame, and for a moment the room smeared at the edges. “Sit still, sweetheart.” 

Cal crouched close, his eyes glinting in the half-light, slick and dark as river stones. “Wrists first, Rhett. Don’t bruise her too much. She’s got to look good for the finale.”

Rhett grunted in agreement and bore down. The first tie cinched tight around my wrists, biting until my fingers went numb. Another loop yanked my ankles together, locking with a sharp scream of plastic teeth. I jerked hard, but the cords only dug deeper, cutting little half-moons into my skin.

“There we go,” Rhett said, straightening and admiring his work. “All snug.”

Cal stood and dragged a folded tarp from the shelf and shook it open, the plastic crackling as he spread it flat across the concrete. 

I forced myself to breathe slow. Keep still. Keep my face slack, as if I had already given up. While their backs were turned, I shifted just enough to work my fingers toward my pocket. My keys dug into my palm, sharp edges biting until I found what I wanted: the little multitool I never left behind.

I bent my wrists awkwardly, sawing the tiny blade against the tie. The jagged edge scraped plastic, each grind loud in my head.

Cal leaned on the workbench and swiped the back of his wrist across his damp forehead. “You wanna know why we hate you?”

“No,” I snapped, the word tasting bitter.

He ignored it. His voice stayed even, almost bored. “Because women like you are weak. They fold. Our mom was proof of that. Rolling through town in her chair, useless. Couldn’t talk, just cried.”

To punctuate it, he made a low, broken keening sound from the back of his throat. Rhett’s head jerked at the noise like a dog catching a whistle. Then he added his own note, a high-pitched yip, answering like they’d rehearsed it.

“You’re sick,” My voice shook and Cal’s voice lost its false calm, rough edges spilling through. 

“We fed her, cleaned her up, and listened to her whimper every single day. You know what that does to a kid?”

Rhett swung the wrench in the air like a baton. “And our father made her that way. Took her tongue so all she could do was bark. Taught her to heel like a mutt. That’s what we grew up with. Not a mother. A dog.”

“She wasn’t weak,” I said, twisting against the ties until the cords bit deeper. “She survived.”

Cal scoffed, cruel and curt. “Survived? She begged for scraps like a stray. Lived in his shadow even after he rotted in prison. You call that surviving?”

Rhett slammed the wrench against the wall. The clang bounced through the room. “We crawled on all fours when we were kids,” he said, his voice breaking into something raw. “Barked right along with her. Didn’t even know it was wrong. We were her pups. That’s what Dad called us in his letters. His bitch and his pups.” For a moment his swagger slipped. Then he snapped it back. “You know he never called us sons? Not once.”

Cal laid a length of chain across the tarp, straightening each link with neat little tugs. “So we made our own kind of family bonding time. This. Our hunt. Our turn. And we’re better at it than he ever was.”

They stared at each other then, feeding on the ugliness between them.

I pressed the tool harder into the edge of the tie. One thread snapped, then another. I kept my face slack.

Cal leaned close, his breath hot on my cheek. “You’ll break the same way she did. They all do.”

My eyes stayed down while the little teeth of the multitool chewed through more plastic. Eventually the zip tie gave way with a tiny crack, soft as a twig snapping underfoot. I froze, forcing my freed wrist to hang limp so they wouldn’t see. A quick flex sent blood rushing back into my hand, pins and needles stinging, but I kept my expression blank. Ankles still bound. Arms free.

Cal picked up a pair of pliers. His eyes glazed and bright at once, like something fevered that had found a flame. “So,” he murmured, snapping the pliers open and shut, “ready to beg, Nora?”

“Not yet,”

His mouth curled at the ends. “We’ll get there.” He clicked the pliers again, close enough the air in front of my nose cracked.

Rhett leaned over the back of the chair, peering at me like a child admiring a trapped bug. “I like her,” he said, voice muffled under the mask. “She’s making us work for it.”

Cal’s tone slid down, almost coaxing. “Don’t worry, Nora. Once you break, it’ll be quick. Quicker than most.”

I lifted my chin, the words spilling out before I could think better. “You’re pathetic. Your dad owns you.”

Something awful flashed in Cal’s eyes. He leaned in close enough for me to feel the tension off him. “Careful, bitch.”

I didn’t give myself the chance to hesitate. My hand came up fast, the multitool’s jagged teeth already biting at the air. Cal’s eyes went wide, but not wide enough. I drove the blade into his left eye with every ounce of strength I had left.

The sound was wrong. A wet, meaty pop, followed by a howl that seemed to rattle the bolts in the walls. He reeled backward, both hands flying to his face, blood seeping hot and fast through his fingers.

“Jesus Christ!” Rhett’s voice cracked, the wrench slipping from his grip and clattering against the floor. He lunged toward his brother. “Cal! Oh my God, she-”

“She got me,” Cal croaked. His voice was ragged, broken at the edges. “That bitch got me.” Blood poured down his cheek in a dark curtain, soaking his shirt, dripping to the floor in fat drops. He started to laugh even as the sound wavered with pain. “She really did it. She really fucking did it!”

They were caught up in each other, Cal shrieking, Rhett fumbling to hold him, both too busy drowning in their own chaos to notice me. That was the only opening I was ever going to get.

I wrenched my legs sideways, twisting until the plastic cut into my skin. The tie at my right ankle gave with a sharp snap. I bent forward, working the bloody tool against the other, sawing in frantic jerks until the plastic finally split.

I lurched up from the chair, half stumble, half desperate run, my legs screaming with pins and needles.

Rhett’s head snapped toward me. “Hey!”

“Get her!” Cal bellowed, clutching the ruin of his eye with both hands, blood streaking down his arm. 

The hallway smeared around me, my vision tunneling as I ran. My shoes slid on patches of oil, every step a fight to stay upright. I dragged one hand along the wall, scraping skin raw just to keep my balance.

Rhett’s laugh echoed after me, high and giddy, like a child on a carnival ride. “She’s fast! This is great!”

I burst through the break room, nearly tripping over the edge of a chair, shoved hard against the soda machine, and bolted into the narrow hall. The side door glared at me like salvation. The chain still coiled through the bar. I clawed at it, nails splitting back, breath wheezing in my throat. Not locked, just knotted. It slipped once, my fingers sliding off slick with sweat. I yanked again and the knot came free.

The bar shoved forward and the door flew wide.

The night air hit me full in the face, crisp and damp, like being slapped with a wet sheet. I ran harder, legs pumping without rhythm, body all panic. Behind me the door banged open, and their voices spilled into the dark, yowling and wild, the sound of hunters too drunk on the chase.

“Run, Nora!” Rhett’s voice cracked with glee.

The lot stretched open, a flood of orange light from the street lamps making every shadow look thinner. I wove between parked cars, ducking low, lungs tearing themselves raw. My vision tunneled until it felt like I was running down a dark pipe. I screamed, over and over, because it was all I had left.

I aimed myself at the glow of the corner lamp, as if the yellow light could burn them away. I didn’t dare look behind me.

A porch light snapped on across the road. Someone shouted, startled and sharp. “Hey! What’s going on?”

“Help!” My throat tore with it. “Call the police! Please!”

Doors opened in a scatter. More lights came up. A woman stood framed in her doorway, phone clutched. “I’m calling 911!”

The night behind me stayed empty.

Sirens began as a faint whine, then swelled until the sound filled my chest. My legs gave out. I crumpled onto the first porch I reached, knees buckling, body shaking so violently I couldn’t keep upright.

The woman with the phone knelt close. She didn’t touch me, her hand hovering in the air like she was afraid one wrong move would shatter me completely.

“They’re coming,” she whispered. “You’re safe now.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to, but my body wouldn’t stop trembling.

At the station I spoke until my throat gave out, the words rasping like sand. I told them everything: the shop, the chair, the mask, the chains. I said their names over and over so no one could pretend they hadn’t heard me. And when I got to the part about the screwdriver, about driving it into Cal’s eye, I sat up straighter. I told them he’d be bleeding badly, that they wouldn’t be able to miss him.

The police went through the shop like ants through sugar, flooding every corner with flashlights. They found the chair bolted to the floor, the chains dangling like dead snakes, the tarp spread neat and waiting. Bits of cut zip ties still curled on the ground, and the screwdriver lay where it had skittered out of reach.

But there were no brothers. No mask. No blood trail leading out the door. Cal and Rhett had already slipped into the dark. 

They still haven’t caught them. Not yet. Somewhere out there, Cal and Rhett are slinking through the cracks of this town, waiting for the right hole to crawl into. But they’re not the same anymore. I did that. Cal’s eye is gone. The mirror between them is broken.

Good. Let them bleed with it.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

If this resonates with you, send me a message.",1,1755914458.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I (27m) just when threw a break up with Lilly (24F) “not her real name but her favorite flower”. Lilly and I have been on and off close friends. We met when I was around 14 at a local coffee shop where she just walked up and started talking to me. Thought out the years the pattern was we get really close, one of us starts dating, the partner doesn’t like how close we we’re, then we stop talking, and we end up talking to each other again down the road and it starts over. 
Our relationship was always plutonic, I had feelings for her but didn’t think she felt the same so I kept my feelings tucked away. there would be times where we would get to a point in hanging out where I feel like there could be something more. But not wanting to push anything and cause she wasn’t single I kept quiet. 
Lillys seen my threw a lot of my bad relationships and I to her, we’ve always been each others rock if we were in each others life. About a year ago we both broke up with our long term significant others and like always rekindled our friendship. This time was different though.
One day I opened up thats I had a crush on her since we were kids. And she admitted to me she had one on me as well. Even though she didn’t want to date so quickly after her last boyfriend we kept seeing each other in that way. Staying exclusive and basically being a couple just without the label. It was really good, the chemistry was amazing and I really felt like this was a good thing.
In the middle of July my high school sweetheart added me on Snapchat. Her and I did a lot of bad things to each other in that relationship and I’ve been sitting on wanting to apologize for the person I was back then and move on. So I accepted the request but didn’t reach out. 
I told Lilly right away and she was very angry and stormed off. She came over the next day so we workout and I jokingly put my balls on her forehead while she was doing beach and she got angry and said don’t be doing that to me when you’re gonna be doing that with you ex soon. Then she went home. I was angry at the comment, I really only wanted her and I tried being clear about my intentions with why I added her. 
I was really stressed at the time from a lot of factors going on so I told her that we needed a break from each other to cool our heads. And come back to this relationship. I wanted to be with her but I couldn’t think with how upset and stressed out I was. A week or so passes by and I asked her to come over so we can talk and get things straightened out. 
When Lilly came over she told me she thought we were actually broken up. I told her I do very much want to be with her and I want to work on this. Lily said she can’t right now, she has strong feelings for me but she needs to work on this just being single.
After the conversation I thought we could be friends and work on being more again. But she got even more distant after that. I would try to talk to her but only get two or 3 messages out of her before she’d leave me on read. 
I finally caved the other day and asked her about it. Knowing that with breakups comes distance but this felt different. 
Lilly admitted that she was talking to someone else. The air left my body, I was at work and just had to walk off. We called and I just let my emotions out. During the cal I asked if we can meet and she said yes. 
And with that hat convo she told me she full heartedly thought I was trying to Persue my ex and was just so angry she just dropped me. She still has feeling for me in a lot of ways but that she does like this other guy. When we were about done talking she went in for a hug and I still feel that passion and love when she touched me. 
I know it’s sad and probably wrong but I said we could still stay in touch but that she has to reach out. I still hope for something with her even now and probably always will. But how it probably stands I lost my longest friend, soemone I care greatly about, and love with all my heart.

As I'm a huge newb, I was hoping someone here could maybe give me some advice. Maybe I'm on a fools quest and what I'm aiming to do just isn't practical, but any advice is appreciated.

**What's the problem?**  
While the syrup tastes fine in isolation, the flavor is indistinguishable in coffee. In a drink with a high ratio of coffee to milk it's not noticeable at all but in a drink with a lot of milk there IS a somewhat pleasant taste, but it's faint enough that one would never be able to guess 'kinako'. I'm trying to find a way to get the flavor stronger without simply just pouring in loads of syrup. 

**What is Kinako?**  
Kinako is a fine powder made from roasted soybeans. It's used in Japanese sweets, my favorite of which is Kinako Agepan (fried bread coated in Kinako). It has a nutty taste not too dissimilar to peanuts.

**What have I tried?**  
Most of my attempts have been in absurdly small quantities 100-200ml and with a 1-1 sugar to water ratio. The sugar is 90% white sugar with a small amount of brown. I have shifted the overall sugar amount a bit, sometimes going as high as 150. Additionally I started with only a single Tablespoon of roasted beans but slowly raised to 4. In my final orgeat attempt I used 100ml of roasted beans. First I tried simply added the beans to the syrup after turning off the heat and letting it sit. I tried this over various lengths of time including in the fridge over 24 hours. Then I tried the same process but with crushing the beans lightly. Then tried again with smashing. Then finally with 10 seconds in the food processor. I also tried an orgeat recipe with a 1-2 water/sugar ratio, soaking the roasted beans in water, creating a pasted from chopped beans and water in the food processor, letting sit, then pressing the paste to extract the 'kinako milk' with which I added sugar to make the syrup.",1,1755913614.0,barista,1,1.0,False

The one you want to tell your friends about until you sound like a broken record. The one that you remember as the start of something big, or something that burns bright and fast. The one that leads to coffee for Saturday morning hangovers.

That all sounds reckless, doesn't it? But I think, when meeting online, you have to light that fuse and get the engine going. So many bright sparks burn out before you even get to warm yourself by the fire. 

I am open to all comers, but I want someone who is looking to connect. Otherwise, I am mostly grounded and reasonable. I enjoy deep conversations and seek a meeting of the minds. Someone to challenge me and be playful. That connection you just can't help but be drawn in to.

I have varied interests and hobbies, I hold down a stable career and I have my life mostly together. Online friends are great, but I would love it if you are within a reasonable distance of New Jersey.

Reach out if any of this sounds like it might be worth the time to explore. Reddit isn't always the most reliable place to meet people, but at my age, the net needs to be cast wide.

The server still gave me instant tea and biscuit and didn't tell anything.

Later before getting down (10 mins before), he came and asked for 20 rs for the tea saying that u had not booked tea.

I told him, you handed it over to me and I thought that tea was complimentary at VB, so you have it to me.

Later he brought in a TT type person (idk) she was like sir u haven't booked tea, so you need to pay. I explained the same again and she requested sir you please adjust this time alone and pay.

1mxoo22,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mxoo22/post_partum_weight_loss/,Post partum weight loss,"Need some advise. I am 5’4, and now 4 months pp. at 6 weeks pp I weighed in at 127 lbs and was super happy. My pre pregnancy weight was 120 and I had been in the best shape of my life at that point… regularly lifted and took cycling classes during the week (ah the child free life). I could squat 135 for like 15 reps… ate super clean all the time. 
Now at 4 months pp I am weighing 134. Which is super frustrating since I wasn’t even that heavy after she was born. At 3 months pp I weighed 129 and that was when I bought a peloton, fixed my diet, started going on 30-60 min walks with baby every day, did quick at home Pilate videos. I use the peloton at least 3-4 times a week. But I gained 5 lbs after doing all that and it shows. This is the heaviest I’ve ever been and it’s all in my upper body and face. 
I’m also exclusively breast feeding which I thought would help me lose weight as well. 
My daily diet consists of one small bowl of ‘fruits and yogurt’ cereal with 2% milk. One apple with peanut butter. And 1 sometimes 2 hard boiled eggs no salt only paprika and pepper. 
My lunches are a struggle, usually a couple of taquitos or leftover chicken and rice. I’ll sometimes DoorDash cava or honeygrow or Panera. But maybe once a week. For dinner I’ll make protein pasta, tacos, burritos, rice and chicken, homemade pizza, etc. overall very clean fresh foods. Once or twice a week we’ll go out to eat but never fast food. No fast food in my diet at all. 
I don’t drink soda, coffee, juice or anything with sugar. We have no junk food in the house except popcorn. My only vice is I’ve been baking chocolate chip cookies with oatmeal and brewers yeast for milk production. I’ll eat 2-3 of those throughout the day with some milk. And I use half the sugar that’s in the recipe. 
SO WHAT AM I DOING WRONG.    Why am I gaining weight still when I’m making myself miserable starving myself all day. I’m literally so hungry and craving sweets all the time but I’m holding myself back to just get back down to 125. 10lbs is all I need to lose. 
I went from being in my fitness influencer era, having the flattest stomach and lifting regularly. I know I have always been a petite build, so losing weight has never been my main concern. I’ve always tried to gain weight and increase my gains for the last 5 years. So this is mentally really hard for me to grasp that I’m not in shape anymore, can’t even bend down to grab the baby without my knees burning, arm fat, shirts aren’t fitting. 

And I know every mom I’ve spoken to immediately says I’m being to hard on myself and it’s only been 4 months. And I totally get that. But in a SAHM now and I have nothing to do but focus on my fitness. Seeing no results- even negative results is so disheartening. I’m not an egotistical person but I do care about my looks and slipping into a depression that’s getting worse everytime I look at myself in the mirror or in pictures. I can’t and don’t want to slip into unhealthy eating habits like I did when I was younger because my baby is dependent on me for her food too.

1mxomo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1mxomo0/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

# 1. 🗾 Japan just launched a Digital Nomad Visa!

That’s right. As of 2024–2025, Japan offers a new **Designated Activities Visa (Remote Work)** for remote workers earning over ¥10M annually (\~$67,000). It’s a huge step forward for long-stay nomads in Asia.

# 2. 🚅 You can live in a tranquil temple town but be in Tokyo in 90 minutes

The bullet train (Shinkansen) isn’t just fast—it’s teleportation-level efficient. You can live in quiet cities like Nagano or Kanazawa and still pop into Tokyo for meetings or networking. Nomad dream? ✅

# 3. 🍱 Convenience stores are next-level

“Konbini” (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart) offer *fresh* bento boxes, coffee, free Wi-Fi, printers, ATMs… and even bills payment. It’s like your coworking pantry… but nationwide.

# 4. 🧘 Japan respects personal space

Unlike some popular nomad hubs, Japan’s culture values quietness, order, and space. Perfect for introverts or deep-focus workers who need calm to get into flow state.

# 5. 🏔️ Digital nomads are moving beyond Tokyo

Sure, Tokyo’s iconic—but spots like **Fukuoka**, **Okinawa**, and **Sapporo** are gaining traction. They offer lower rent, creative scenes, and growing coworking/coliving options.

# 6. 💻 24/7 coworking exists—even in the countryside

Japan is quietly packed with ultra-clean, modern coworking spaces. You’ll find fiber internet in unlikely places—from a café in Kyoto to a coliving lodge in the Japanese Alps.

# 7. 🏡 You can rent a countryside house for less than $400/month

Thanks to Japan’s declining rural population, programs like **akiya houses** (abandoned homes) allow foreigners to live in traditional homes—some nearly free, or with grants!

# 8. 🌐 Internet is blazing fast—even on trains!

Japan ranks consistently high in both fixed broadband and mobile speeds. Even riding the Shinkansen, you'll be streaming or Zooming without issue. Remote work from anywhere = real.

**Final Thought 🌸**  
Japan is evolving from a tourist-heavy destination to a more sustainable, nomad-friendly country. If you’re looking for a mix of structure, serenity, and innovation—it might be time to give it a serious look.

What  made  this  all  the  more  strange  was  that  it  wasn’t  just  the  barista  that  was  saying  Milton,  it  was  nearly  everyone.  The  woman  at  the  dry  cleaners  when  he  was  picking  up  his  dress  pants,  the  owner  of  the  deli  when  he  was  going  for  his  usual  pastrami  on  rye,  even  his  boss  at  the  office.  They  all  said  the  same  name.  He’d  try  and  correct  them  at  first  by  saying  “*Actually,  it’s-*”  or  “*No,  my  name  is-*” ,  but  they’d  all  blink  twice,  confused,  and  simply  smile  it  off  as  if  *he*  was  the  strange  one.  As  if  the  world  made  perfect  sense,  they’d  all  say  *“Right…Milton”*,  and  nod  it  off.  By  the  end  of  that  same  week,  he  stopped  trying.  Why  fight  it  anymore?  If  his  name  was  Milton,  then  that’s  what  he’ll  go  by.  He  signed  a memo  under  the  name,  he  answered  his  company  phone  under  the  name,  he  grabbed  his  coffees  and  sandwiches  and  clothes  all  under  Milton.  Milton  didn’t  know  why  he  stuck  with  it  and  defended  his  real  name.  Milton  didn’t  know  how  or  when  it  started,  but  he  learned  early  in  his  life  that  change  is  necessary  in  the  world.  He  learned  to  accept  the  change,  he  learned  to  love  being  Milton.



It  was  sometime  about  5  years  later,  at  the  deli.  Milton  was  in  his  usual  spot,  waiting  for  his  usual  order,  when  the  owner  called  out  “*Here  ya  go,  Jacob!*”.  Jacob?  Milton  looked  left  and  right,  but  he  was  the  only  one  in  the  deli  that  hadn’t  received  his  order.  He  sat  there,  puzzled,  as  the  deli  owner  looked  straight  at  him  and  repeated,  “*Jacob?  Pastrami  on  rye?*”  A  small  pause.  “*That’s  you,  right?*”  Still  looking  perplexed,  Milton  (or,  apparently,  Jacob)  stammered  and  said  “*I…I  think  you  mean  Milton.*”  The  owner  furrowed  his  brow.  “*Milton?  This  some  kinda  game?*”,  the  owner  asked.  “*No,  you  just  called  me  Jacob.  My  name’s  Milton,  you  know  that.*”  The  owner  simply  shaked  his  head  in disinterest  and  walked  away,  leaving  Milton’s  (Jacob’s?)  sandwich  on  the  high  counter.  At  the  office,  as  Milton  logged  into  his  computer,  his  top  priority  email  started  with:  *“Greetings,  Jacob!”*  Again,  “*Jacob”*?  Milton  sat  at  his  desk  staring  at  that  name  for  about  a  minute,  when  he  was  startled  by  his  boss  when  he  gave  a  pat  on  the  back  and  said  “*Great  job  on  the  client  report,  Jacob!*”  What  was  going  on?  Why  was  everyone,  even  machines,  calling  him  Jacob?  He  looked  down  at  his  ID  badge  (which  he  had  no  idea  where  it  came  from)  and  it  said  “*Jacob  K.  Parker*”,  and  next  to  the  name  was  his  picture  with  a  big  grin  on  his  face  as  if  he  was  the  new  guy  on  his  first  day  on  the  job.  The  same  thing  happened  at  the  cafe  when  he  went  for  his  usual  drink  and  the  barista  called  out  “*Jacob!”*,  even  when  the  young  worker  asked  for  his  name  and  he  looked  him  dead  in  the  eye  and  told  him “*Milton,  MY  NAME  IS  MILTON!”*.  Milton  (or  was  he  Jacob?)  had  had  enough  of  it  and  rushed  directly  to  the  barista  who  asked  his  name  and  stared  at  him  with  cold,  dead  eyes  and  demanded  “*I  told  you  my  name!  You’ve  known  my  name  for  the  past  5  years!  So,  why?!  Why  did  you  call  me  Jacob  when  I  said  Milton??*”  The  barista,  being  only  a  mere  23,  simply  answered  back  “*Sir,  you  said  your  name  was  Jacob.  There’s  no  such  name  as  Milton,  anymore.”*  Anymore?      



Things  were  truly  turning  upside  down  for  Milton  (or  Jacob,  apparently).  As  much  as  the  ID  out  of  nowhere  at  work  startled  him,  it  was  two  things  that  stuck  with  him:  the  recurring  sudden  name  change  and  what  the  barista  told  him.  He  wasn’t  Jacob,  he  was  Milton.  He  *had*  to  be,  wasn’t  he?  How  could  a  name  not  exist  anymore?  A  name’s  a  name  and  it  sticks  with  anyone,  be  it  human  or  animal  or  object.  Regardless, he  found  himself  in  an  endless  cycle  of  correcting,  explaining,  insisting  to  everyone  that  his  name  was Milton,  of  course  keeping  to  himself  that  he  had  been  Milton  for  the  past  5  years.  The  cycle  would  prove  to  be  useless  as  it  would  result  in  his  counterparts  giving  nervous  smiles,  blank  stares,  and  people  giving  him  looks  like  he  had  seagulls  flying  out  of  his  ears.  Milton  (Jacob,  whatever  his  name  was)  sat  on  the  edge  of  his  bed,  staring  into  the  darkness  of  the  night  and  wondering  what  did  this  all  mean.  Just  before  midnight,  his  cell  phone  rang.  The  name  on  the  screen  said  “UNKNOWN”,  but,  at  this  point,  he  wasn’t  affected  by  it  and  answered  the  call.  The  voice  on  the  other  end  spoke  slowly,  almost  gently.  “*We’re  glad  you  enjoyed  being  Milton*”,  it  said.  “*But  your  trial  period  is  over.*”  Click.

1mxoemi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mxoemi/i_lost_my_childhood_crush/,I lost my childhood crush,"Sorry for bad punctuation I slept through english but I will try my best. 
I (27m) just when threw a break up with Lilly (24F) “not her real name but her favorite flower”. Lilly and I have been on and off close friends. We met when I was around 14 at a local coffee shop where she just walked up and started talking to me. Thought out the years the pattern was we get really close, one of us starts dating, the partner doesn’t like how close we we’re, then we stop talking, and we end up talking to each other again down the road and it starts over. 
Our relationship was always plutonic, I had feelings for her but didn’t think she felt the same so I kept my feelings tucked away. there would be times where we would get to a point in hanging out where I feel like there could be something more. But not wanting to push anything and cause she wasn’t single I kept quiet. 
Lillys seen my threw a lot of my bad relationships and I to her, we’ve always been each others rock if we were in each others life. About a year ago we both broke up with our long term significant others and like always rekindled our friendship. This time was different though.
One day I opened up thats I had a crush on her since we were kids. And she admitted to me she had one on me as well. Even though she didn’t want to date so quickly after her last boyfriend we kept seeing each other in that way. Staying exclusive and basically being a couple just without the label. It was really good, the chemistry was amazing and I really felt like this was a good thing.
In the middle of July my high school sweetheart added me on Snapchat. Her and I did a lot of bad things to each other in that relationship and I’ve been sitting on wanting to apologize for the person I was back then and move on. So I accepted the request but didn’t reach out. 
I told Lilly right away and she was very angry and stormed off. She came over the next day so we workout and I jokingly put my balls on her forehead while she was doing beach and she got angry and said don’t be doing that to me when you’re gonna be doing that with you ex soon. Then she went home. I was angry at the comment, I really only wanted her and I tried being clear about my intentions with why I added her. 
I was really stressed at the time from a lot of factors going on so I told her that we needed a break from each other to cool our heads. And come back to this relationship. I wanted to be with her but I couldn’t think with how upset and stressed out I was. A week or so passes by and I asked her to come over so we can talk and get things straightened out. 
When Lilly came over she told me she thought we were actually broken up. I told her I do very much want to be with her and I want to work on this. Lily said she can’t right now, she has strong feelings for me but she needs to work on this just being single.
After the conversation I thought we could be friends and work on being more again. But she got even more distant after that. I would try to talk to her but only get two or 3 messages out of her before she’d leave me on read. 
I finally caved the other day and asked her about it. Knowing that with breakups comes distance but this felt different. 
Lilly admitted that she was talking to someone else. The air left my body, I was at work and just had to walk off. We called and I just let my emotions out. During the cal I asked if we can meet and she said yes. 
And with that hat convo she told me she full heartedly thought I was trying to Persue my ex and was just so angry she just dropped me. She still has feeling for me in a lot of ways but that she does like this other guy. When we were about done talking she went in for a hug and I still feel that passion and love when she touched me. 
I know it’s sad and probably wrong but I said we could still stay in touch but that she has to reach out. I still hope for something with her even now and probably always will. But how it probably stands I lost my longest friend, soemone I care greatly about, and love with all my heart.

1mxoek3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mxoek3/am_i_overreacting_for_wanting_to_remove_myself_as/,Am I overreacting for wanting to remove myself as the matron of honour… the wedding is tomorrow,"I’d like to apologise in advance if this gets too long and confusing but my thoughts are scattered and my nerves are shot. But I love this online family we have and would like to know whether I’m overreacting or totally justified.  

My husband and I have taken our first ever overseas vacation (we’ve been together for 12 years), which we’ve centred around his best friends wedding. Upon hearing we could make it he asked my husband to be his best man. We’re Serbian Orthodox, so if the best man or maid/matron of honour is married you essentially take the married couple as a package. The brides exact words over the phone were “this cements your friendship” a comment directed my husband best friends relationship. In this rollercoaster of a year leading up to the wedding I have had 4 miscarriages, multiple health issues and have a young daughter to raise while being the primary carer for my sick parents and juggling work. I really never have any time for me, lucky to have 30 minutes a week collectively.  My husband is also overly busy, between work and being a yes man and assisting everyone else, there are weeks I barely see him. This is something I both love and get frustrated over. Anyway, the couples knows our struggles, we’re an open book. 

We live 2 states over and I always assumed that between the distance, the bride having her sisters and mum on board and a handful of other close female friends meant she didn’t want much off me, but I always offered. I found out from our friend who lives in Serbia and helped arrange everything (God bless her because without her there wouldn’t be a wedding to begin with) that although I’m technically meant to be a part of the wedding party only the bride, her mum and sisters are getting ready together and that they didn’t arrange anything for me. I don’t care, I’m happy to do my own, but I wouldn’t have known anything if I didn’t ask this friend who my husband speaks with every other week.I asked the bride initially and she told me to ask our friend as she “didn’t know” what the arrangement was…. Our friend said she just followed the directions she was given. All I asked was “are we getting ready together? Otherwise please let me know what time you’d like me at the apartment so I can make the appropriate arrangements?

Well 4 months ago she had a semi bachelorette and I wasn’t invited. I saw photos first thing in the morning, told my husband and didn’t really pay it much attention in all honesty. The groom to be called not long after for some basic chit chat with my husband and then went on to try and excuse my non invite as it was a small get together with work friends that wouldn’t be able to attend the wedding. I don’t want any bad blood between my husband and his friend so I chose to ignore the fact that the grooms sister and 3 girls from the friendship group were also there that would all be in attendance at the wedding (2 of them mums). Fast track through all the unorganised mess of a wedding and pre wedding events, the bride and groom arrive to the wedding city separately. The bride travelled to her home city and had a second bachelorette with just her friends and family, again I didn’t say anything. I wasn’t going to abandon my family to travel to another area of the country the moment I barely know anyone or how to use  public transport. Besides I respect the fact her sisters live here and she probably wanted something more intimate with family. 

Meanwhile, the groom has changed so many plans over the last 3 days that nobody knows what’s going on. It has caused a lot of unnecessary stress  and arguments amoungst people in the wedding party. For example, he asked my husband to be his best man and yet my husband was the last person called and invited for a small get together/dinner for the families, only 1.5 hours before the scheduled dinner. 

Fast track to today, the day before the wedding. We did our running around earlier this week and only needed to pick up our clothing from the dry cleaners and take out some money from the bank today. We planned our day accordingly to fit in a swim with some friends that had also travelled half way across the world for this wedding. All we knew was we had to be at the beach bar (kids allowed) by 11pm. By 6 pm we started unwinding and I took my son for a quick shower at our friends hotel room. When I came out everyone looked off and told me plans had changed and I had been messaged about it already. I looked at my phone and at 5:30 was invited (if I wanted) to go by the brides apartment where she will be with her family, godsister and kids and 2 other mums with kids because the venue had been cancelled as they didn’t allow children and everyone else had been catered for to attend a concert, men and women (I called later, the venue had no issue with kids they just didn’t allow prams due to seating restrictions). Only us mums were left out and invited to spend the night with people we don’t know because everyone wanted to go to the concert and (including the groom) and decided to use that excuse to change plans. Meanwhile his sister managed to get a babysitter for her kids to attend and one of the mums would already be in attendance at the brides before we were even notified of the change (so way low in the chain of communication). Now I’ll be honest this was my tipping point. Months of constantly calling my husband best man and me being pushed aside through all conversations, my husband even referring to the fact he’s going to wed them not “us” or “we”, two events where I wasn’t invited, then travelling half way across the world to be told I’m invited to an apartment with random people I don’t know simply because I’m a mum with a young child (I had my older friend offer to watch my daughter as she didn’t want to go, but when you’re not invited, you’re not invited and I’m not going where I’m not invited) and finally when I asked what the plan for the following day would be I was told whatever I want and it’s not necessary to be at the brides and I can just go straight to the church if I want to. I’m not an idiot I got the hint a long time ago that I’m not wanted but I played stupid because I’ll never be the reason someone didn’t enjoy their wedding or ruin my husbands friendship (in our culture the respective partners are at the brides and grooms houses the day of the wedding to get ready together and take photos and drink etc). My husband was told when to be at the grooms, meanwhile I’m the one who reached out twice to the bride to pretty much be told it doesn’t matter what I do, which fi me translates to “I don’t care”. 

In the end I didn’t go to the brides place, by the time I got out the shower my daughter fell asleep after a long day at the beach and I’m not waking up a kindergartener to head on out to a place where we’re both not going to enjoy ourselves. I excused myself as I’ll have my daughter to myself all day tomorrow and she’s currently stuck on her daddy because she never gets this much time with her daddy and knows it’s holiday time. It’s been a difficult task just trying to keep her separated so my husband can run his errands. 
It’s currently 3am, she woke up an hour ago full or energy and now I’m getting constant tags and posts online for a party I’m not even at. I’m not the petty type but honestly, they can take their wedding and suck it at this stage. I don’t expect to be pampered and I let everything slide, but apparently I’m the “maid of honour” and it’s like I’m transparent and don’t exist. I’m just the tag along because they need the second witness on their marriage certificate and I’m my husbands wife. Tomorrow I’m expected to be up at the alter with the three of them with a fake smile like everything’s ok. Ultimately I know I’ll go, but AITA for having these lingering thoughts that for own sanity I just shouldn’t go. 


*context- 
1) we’ve been in this city for 2 weeks, prepping for things on our end. The groom got here 4 days after us and the bride only 3 days before the wedding.

2) People have arrived scattered and because only my husband bothered to rent a car, he’s been playing taxi driver picking everyone up at the dock, bus stop and train stations. He then would have a coffee and relax with others beachside while I was at home taking care of our daughter on my own. Anyone who has been on holidays with a young child in a confined apartment, with minimal room to move and toys to keep themself busy with can imagine the challenge. All while my husband has put his hand up without once asking what I wanted to do. I know he wants to help and it’s a temporary thing but damn it I’m on holiday too and want to be enjoying myself as well. 

3) I’m the one who has been carrying all the important documentation with us in the event they were needed, which is a good thing that I did because once we landed our foot in Serbia the groom told my husband the priest wants cite the original wedding document not just the copy. Thankfully another friend offered to drop them off as my husband had an appointment at the bank while I got my nails done as the groom was ready to give the priest our originals to keep. 

4) If I didn’t pack our bags my husband wouldn’t know where anything would be (we finished packing a few hours before our flight because he was too busy helping everyone else out back at home). So I’m constantly being asked where things are while my daughter is acting up and I have half the people around us telling me off for trying to keep order and the other half telling me I’m doing a good job. Meanwhile the grandmothers are all giving me unsolicited advice and implying I’m not a good wife because I don’t fill up my husbands plate when he’s done while I haven't even started my food because I’m feeding our daughter. Then the women give me looks because I’m always last at the dinner table can’t they can’t clean up until I finish. Yes my husband tries to back me up, but honestly it’s women hating on women’ around here. (Extended family of the groom) 

5) The moment my daughter set foot in Serbia was the moment she started using the toilet and 95% of the time it’s me that takes her. I have to run dripping wet from the beach to the restaurants or bars to take her to the toilet. 

6) I’m in the middle of constant arguments. Our friends (brothers) keep arguing as one is helping his wife out with these wedding plans and the other is annoyed that they’re arranging everything and yet the bride and groom “can’t even let their guests know where and what time to show up for things” in his words 

7)lastly, before leaving for this break, I had spent 3 months making planners with contacts, reference guides,  arranging home appointments and carers for my parents etc so everything can work on autopilot while we’re away. I have also been carrying around 3 very costly injections for my crohns (which is a task in itself given peak Summer season and travelling) and took my second dose yesterday (these knock me around for a few days) and probably too much information but my hormones are all over the place due to that time of the month. 

Sorry for the rant and ramble, I hope this just adds some context as to where my head space might be at with the current chaos around me. Am I overreacting ",8,1755912262.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

*Wait a moment-* I thought, then glaring at Gavin in the driver’s seat.

“How did you know where-”

“Trade secret, son.”

How? How had they done it? Who told them where I’d be? Had someone ratted out my whereabouts? Did they have the house under visual surveillance via drone, or even satellite? The only ones with access to that kind of surveillance tech would be Shil’vati and if any of them knew or could keep tabs on me, I doubted anyone’s locations would stay secret for long. Something in me, that bit that I’d laid to rest in preparation to leave with Natalie if ever my cover was blown, started stirring unhappily.

“There, you see? Still in there. You see that?” He asked, pointing at me from across the front bench seat, as if Gavin would turn his head and take his eyes off the road while he drove us around my neighborhood for a second loop. “That’s our Emperor, right there. You poke him in the right spot, that crazy paranoid brain starts ticking.”

*What paranoid brain? What does he know? Who told him?*

“Now down to business. From our briefing, our activities have drawn quite a bit of attention even beyond Earth. Scopes picked up something *big* entering the solar system. Bigger than big. Bigger than anything in the Fleet, and that means bigger than anything the Fleet has.” My head spun. Bigger than the fleet’s resources? Then who?

“That means one thing and one thing only, and it ain’t good. The new General’s no slouch. Make no mistake, I’ve little doubt that she’ll reignite the war the moment it looks favorable, but now we might have a whole new kettle of fish to deal with.”

“She isn’t? She will? We do?”

Sullivan’s veins bulged as a scream burst out. “Get your head back in the game, goddammit!” He inhaled back in half the smoke he’d just shouted out into the passenger cabin, and his death grip on the plush front row of seats dug into the cushions. “You phone it in at all with all this namby-pamby bullshit about peace and love and cooperation, or be anyone other than yourself, and for all we know they’ll think we’ve got a body double meeting with them, and I’ll have stuck my neck out picking you up, relocating everything to Delaware and explaining all of who we are for less than nothing. So - that little thing I saw in the back of your mind? I want to see it ticking double-time by the time I leave, or so help me I’ll put a bullet in you and wear the mask my own damn self!”

His eyes bored holes into mine from behind those aviators and I knew he meant every insane word.

“Fine!” I snapped back, and he slowly relaxed, smile dragging those gaunt features upward until the skin pulled a little more taut over where age had softened his jawline. “What is it you want me to do?”

“Like I said, there’s an object up in space,” he grumbled. “A big one. Really big. Like, ‘at the right time of the day you can look up and see it- *that* kind of ‘big’. BFO. Big Fucking Object. You get *one guess* what it is.”

I gawked. I had to- that was *massive*. Natalie and I hadn’t made it to the stratosphere before I’d lost sight of anything distinguishable in the fleet. How hadn’t Natalie or anyone heard about this yet? I supposed I was being told right now, wasn’t I? If I had to guess, they’d come straight here to tell me out of one of the nearby manufacturing plants.

“A…mothership?” I mean that tracked, didn’t it?

“Nope! Well, maybe, but to our interests, it's more what's *in* it.”

Gavin shook his head. “You freak me out sometimes, man, and you’re freaking the kid out, too. Maybe it’s better if I just explain. Come on, we’re already late for D.C.,”

“Are you kidding? This is the most fun I’ve had since Bethesda! Alright, sunshine. I’ll cut you a break, before you break on me. We’re impressed with you. *Really* impressed. How would you like to go to school?”

“Saint...Michael’s?” I asked, slow on the uptake, turning my head toward where we were passing the school again. So much for how I’d planned for today to go, and by the sound of it, the way I’d intended to spend most of the year, too.

Now that Delaware was green, I’d soon *have* to attend school again. No good deed went unpunished.

“No, goddammit! That place is churning out the future nose-picker middlemen of America’s most useless bureaucratic departments. They’ll lose their hair by thirty, get some re-growth snake oil serum, knock up the babysitter, drop their wives, and die of a heart attack in the Philippines by fifty after *years* of tolerance buildup. I’m talking about *real* power, kid! Leadership academy! One-on-one courses, war gaming, nobles all around for you to twist secrets from. You’ll be the first human entering class - and as one of the only males.”

I coughed. “You want to send me to - to school? Shil school? Where?”

He leaned in, and eyed me up and down, gravelly voice suddenly taking on a note of false concern that was more insulting than anything else he’d said so far today. “You’re sure they treated that concussion completely?”

It all clicked together, even if I didn’t understand the ‘how’ or ‘why,’ it was obvious that the giant thing up there was some sort of a school that belonged to the Shil’vati, and if he wasn’t concerned about it belonging to the Coalition or Alliance, then I shouldn’t be either.

Then it dawned on me. It wasn’t the Fleet’s. Amilita had said things were ‘fine’. When the Coalition had phased in en masse, there had been a lockdown immediately ordered, every device ordering it. This time, there hadn’t been anything like that.

Natalie had never mentioned having anything so large as the Fleet Battleships or Carriers, either, and while her mother wasn’t rich, her father wasn’t exactly poor, either. Then again, they weren’t really ‘flashy’ as Noble families went, more concerned with their work rather than drawing attention to themselves, which given the nature of her mother’s true work, only made sense. The Interior wasn’t exactly renowned for possessing sheer tonnage, either. What other shil’vati power structure might be both major enough, and ostentatious enough to have something so large?

“Oh.”

“There we go. No idea what the fuck this means for us on the ground. We’ll find out soon enough, though. So we’re keeping this brief. Pretty sure we’ll have to go back down to Maryland by tonight.”

“[Domino’s](https://i.imgur.com/c3RBtJW.jpeg),” Gavin rubbed his belly disappointedly, as if in anticipation for indigestion, then glancing at the clock. “We’ll supposedly get more details when we get there, but it’s probably just going to be what we’ve already got. Still, they’re gonna notice if we’re not there.”

Sullivan cursed unhappily.

“Frankly, with New Jersey floundering, I dunno. I mean, shouldn’t we shore up, entrench deeper? Use this as a distraction to capitalize?” At least Pennsylvania was starting to see progress. New York had missed its daily check-in, but they’d had a recent change of commander, and were probably still taking stock after their first strike.

“That’s part of the problem,” he admitted. “Your men aren’t getting the job done.”

True, but at least I could trust them. “Then let me take to the field.” I didn’t want to beg. Hell, I didn’t even want to have to *ask.* Hadn’t he just said he was impressed with how well I was doing? I supposed that had been either flattery or sarcasm.

“No! Weren’t you just listening? Of course you weren’t, it’s why we had to come get you. You’re *important*, dammit. We can’t be losing you. It’s risky enough you keep slipping out to visit Generals and tell them in person what you already wrote down for them.”

“Come on, I’m up here doing surprise inspections on production facilities. Secret medal ceremonies for the wounded survivors. I’m going over…” I wished I’d brought my bag just so I could rap knuckles against all the coded notes. “Just empty, meaningless, pointless make-work, and it sounds like it’s not going well. We had a good thing going in the way we do things, and now it’s changed. Do you think I led from the rear when I got my victories? I studied that stuff endlessly, and I can’t advise with a day’s delay or get by on photos and outdated physical topographical maps to work out strikes, I have to actually be there and help out!”

“You got it down to a damn science,” Sullivan admitted, or perhaps countered by that tone. I was so thrown off I didn’t even say anything, waiting for the other shoe to chime in.

“And science is replicable, or else it’s not science,” Gavin added for Sullivan. The phrase was a familiar one. Father used to say it, back when I’d asked how research went. I guess it must have been a common phrase. When Gavin caught my eyes in the rearview mirror, he didn’t hold the gaze for long, refocusing on the road even though they were on a straightaway. “Which begs what the hell they’re doing up there, since they’re not getting better results. Or whether you’d fare any better. If the aliens have adapted, you’ll just die. How does that help?”

*It’d get me out of the way so you can get rid of my men and take over. I didn’t think you’d oppose that.* Though I supposed this was at least evidence they didn’t think that little of me. Maybe I was just being unreasonably mistrustful. Toward the CIA. I almost snickered at that.

I crossed my arms. “I didn’t kick this thing off just to be told where to go and when.”

“And you’ve been clever so far about where you’re seen crossing borders as Elias, versus where Emperor might pop up. New Jersey’s still nominally yellow, thanks to our efforts there largely being unsuccessful so far. If you go as Elias Sampson, DataNet star, into a genuine red zone like Maryland, you’ll be expected to bring a real security detail on you. How will you give them the slip, especially if Emperor pops up at the same time and same place? And what if you *do* succeed, what, *then* you’ll replace your man, because you can do it and he can’t?”

“No, I suppose, but-”

Sullivan jumped in impatiently. “-We can’t spread word to not harm known-sympathizer Elias Sampson without *someone* there getting suspicious. And if we don’t? There’s nothing more embarrassing than getting beaned by one of your own. That tally don’t score, dammit!” He slapped the leather upholstery.

“Hey, I gave myself a pass. That counts for something, right?” I tapped my laminated pass. I hadn’t even had to wave it around.

“You think a piece of paper’s ever saved anyone from me kicking their ass? Go on, hold it out in front of you. See if it helps.” He made a fist and waved it in front of me for show, before falling back into his seat when Gavin took the corner a bit faster than he needed to with an exasperated sigh at his boss’s theatrics.

Point taken.

“Alright, then what? You send me to school-”

“Uh huh.”

“Up there.” I pointed at the roof of the car.

“Yep.”

“Since it’s bullshit work I’m doing already, regardless.”

“That’s the grand idea. Frankly, I kept getting updated as we rolled over to here with better and better news. It’s a noble school. Some kind of Grand Poo-Bah up there. Royal. Not noble. Big difference. It’s called *‘The Vanguard,’* and it’s where they train all their best soldiers. I read out all the notes we’ve got so far.” He kicked a sealed case in the passenger footwell. “You feed us secrets- how they make the best steels, their counter-insurgency doctrines. The capabilities of their weapons, the accuracy of those rock-drops, how far into our atmosphere their capital ships can go, and what happens if they try coming in too low. We wanna know it all, and that place up there-” he joined me in pointing up. “-Has it all.”

I swallowed. Earth really *had* punched above its weight, then. Way above. Also, he had a point. I hated to admit it, but this was more useful than what I was doing currently. We’d experimented with early strikes, trying to determine response times, judge where the shil’vati were mobilizing out of, what bandwidth the police were using and their codes. It had been a long process with mistakes costing lives. What if we could remove the error factor? That would save a lot of lives and potentially get things unstuck on all fronts at once.

“One issue. My grades are abhorrent. I didn’t want anyone thinking I was smart, or capable of, you know. Of being Emperor.” Plus, doing remedial homework when living a double-life fell somewhere way, *way* down the priority list.

“Son,” he laughed in a smoker’s characteristic dry rasp. “Do you know what your score was for the [DSTP?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Student_Testing_Program)”

My heart sank. I’d told Vaughn and Natalie that grades didn’t matter for advancement to the next year. Technically, I’d been right. Talay was *nominally* a middle school, even if we’d all missed years of school with the invasion and subsequent time getting basic services running again. I had skipped homework, essays, and other assignments.

Except I’d not held back on the test. I’d written my own speeches in both English and Shil’vati after studying the greats and refining them under Parker and Pierce’s tutelage. I’d balanced the books on the insurgency using algebra. I’d used Bayes’ theorem on what the Shil’vati were likely up to and whether some things were worth the risk or not, working with Verns, Grouper, and others to accumulate evidence. I’d charted the economic future of our insurgency and return on investment for continued weapons research, and probability of payoff.

I’d worked the chemistry for the bombs, electrical conversion tables and charts for the gravity belts, charge packs, and railgun designs. I’d used physics to chart the likely stress points of the Data Center we’d collapsed, trying to determine if the velocity and mass of our rounds would penetrate deep enough to structurally compromise it. I studied the biological research Miskatonic was conducting, and understood the challenges they faced. Their latest success had been some sort of behavioral alterant, whose chemical composition I could still recall. When updated designs on the railguns were delivered, or I was demanded to give to the various research groups managed by Gavin and Sullivan, I kept asking for the concepts to be simplified whenever what came to me was so much gibberish or technobabble, until I or someone else at last did understand it. I stressed my brain working my way past wherever I got stuck to where I was needed to.

The practical applications of the work for the last year had made the DSTP, graded to assess middle schoolers, an absolute triviality. But that just spoke of me. Even if the other students weren’t years behind where St. Michael’s had been, and the student body was all years older than the students the school had been designed for by the time classes had re-commenced, and most of them hadn’t encountered the material before…and the only other private school transfer hadn’t been emotionally shattered by the loss of her father…

Which meant, which meant…

“No…”

“Congratulations, Brainiac! All that was left to do was hack into the local school district and change your grades. Trivial for your friend Radio, who has had Admin access for the better part of the last year. He’d already changed his and G-Man’s to justify our adding him and your friend to a pair of our ‘internship’ programs.”

Great. So they doubtless knew their civilian identities, too. Though that was almost a certainty, given that they’d taken Vaughn with them.

“Past that, well, that General pinned a medal to your chest. And you’ve got yourself balls-deep in that noble girl, don’t you?”

I wanted to protest ‘we’re not-’ but the last thing I wanted to do was let them get the conversation and their focus stuck on Natalie. I wanted them as far away from Natalie as I could possibly manage.

“We can get a few foundations to say they’ve had you on as an intern this summer, and slap a few more endorsements on top of that.” He eyed me up and down. “Whaddya say? Hagley archivist? Kalmyr Nyckel restoration team? Wilmington Trolley junior designer?” He scratched at his scruffy chin hairs a few times. “Whatever, we’ll think of something to say you were keeping busy that sounds nice and brush you up on it. Get a senator to endorse you, too, ducks in a row. You’re a proper space cadet!”

Gavin chortled, and then pulled off to the side near where they’d picked me up. “So, it’s a done deal, then?”

“If you try and fight it, it’ll be the dumbest thing you ever did. You don’t have to stay for long- eventually whoever’s up there’ll get bored and move on.”

Without another word, the pair were gone, careening toward I-95 South doing about double the speed limit, then triple.

I glanced over my shoulder toward the parking lot at St. Michael’s.

All that wrangling and self-reflection seemed like so much neurotic melodrama now.

This could do a lot. It was clear Earth was at the centerpoint of *something* big, or had brought some sort of issue to a head. The states were continuing to rebel. Maryland and Virginia were redder than ever. Pennsylvania had flipped red, too. Myrrah hadn’t thought I’d beat Azraea, and now there was a crater and memorial where she’d last stood, little more than a mile away.

Of course, this was assuming the Shil’vati did nothing to retaliate- and from everything I’d seen so far, that was a bad bet. They were uncertain with how to deal with humanity, and had compunctions on certain things. They’d also shown they’d cast those aside if the situation got desperate enough. How far could I push it? How much could I get away with?

I swept those doubts aside in favor of a different thought: *Who was going to try and stop me?*

## Fuzzy Memories, Concrete Regret

The orders were loud and rough, cutting through the lingering, multi-day hangover, and bringing that sense of foreboding that had hung over Ne’le to a crescendo. It was no surprise, then, when she heard the names to fall out of formation and report. Eyes followed her and her fellows as each was ‘escorted’ to the officer deck.

Whispers were drowned out by the rush of blood between her ears and her racing thoughts. What should she confess to, and how certain was she in what she was even confessing?

“Forty eight hours ago, we were ambushed. Railguns, bombs, you name it. All the hallmarks of an Emperor-aligned cell. Mostly women fighters.”

She closed her eyes as she remembered the whip-crack of lasbolts splitting the air, and thunder of near-misses from the railguns returning fire. Just like then, she’d dug deep into herself and found that they were being flanked and would be annihilated if they were pinned down. No cover could hold against that kind of firepower. She had only one option- *charge.* Close the gap.

She’d thrown her entire bandoleer of grenades, overcharged her lasgun to empty the power pack in a single wild shot, and found herself running toward the enemy, screaming.

All her podmates at her back had been screaming in her ear, and were silenced as even her omni-pad became a hurled projectile. Either luck or divine provenance had led her to score a glancing hit on the lead insurgent who had poked his head up, and then she was on the bastard, holding him out as a sentient shield as the others abandoned their positions, some leaving behind equipment, scattering to the winds.

They’d done it. Faced certain death and came out victorious, not even needing the promised support that always arrived too late to make a difference.

“We were heroes,” she said defiantly. “We came back to pats on the shoulder, drinks. A night on the town to celebrate our hard-earned win from a position that the omni-pads said shouldn’t have been possible. We gambled and won. Our blood was up. We were tired but felt invincible, like we could do anything. That’s the point of our training, isn’t it? To convince us that we can do anything. Even the impossible, if that’s what the situation demands of us. The Marine Method. Limitless performance, means just that. No Limits.”

The words hung heavy as she met her commanding officer’s accusatory glare. She didn’t twist her face into any expression. After the unease and the words ‘no,’ haunting her sleep, she was too tired to carry on any theatrics.

“Sergeant, if you are excusing yourself and blaming the training methods, then I am beyond words for this.”

“I do not,” she said heavily. “The bar was welcoming. Boys in outfits, approaching us, telling us all what we wanted to hear, until it’s the three of us and one very eager boy, with a room upstairs. The right age, the right look in his eye, you know the kind.” No one met her gaze. “You do, though. You don’t want to admit it, but there’s a look in the eye. Even if you have to imagine it, you know it. One that promises trouble, and this time he *said* it, too. ‘You can do whatever you want.’ To all of us. Well, anything in committee results in no one getting what they want. No one. Not him, not us.”

“So you’re saying no one wanted it? It’s also true when everyone does what they want, you get terrible outcomes. You’re *all* culpable.”

She shrugged. “Maybe I’m taking the easy way here, assuming that the women in my pods don’t want what happened. There’s a level of trust required to do what we did- the good part, I mean, so I’m going to trust that each of us thought it was what the other did, and we have each others’ backs. No one wants to be the one who didn’t leave what precious little cover she had, to say ‘no’. No one wants to stay behind.” She stuck her head up. “‘Everyone fights. No one stays low and hides in the shallows.’ That’s the phrase in training, right? We aren’t the Alliance, with one fighting woman for ninety nine bureaucrats to approve every step she might or might not take.”

“We also aren’t the Coalition! You don’t recklessly just run out and do whatever we want. Especially not what you just did. It’s not enough to just do things, you have to be conscientious about *what* you are doing, and *why* you are doing it.”

Ne’le hung her head in assent. She liked her commanding officer. She was *technically* nobleborn, though with the new decree declaring thirdborn and later of noble and non-noble as disinherited of the title, she still commanded respect. The Marine Captain was wise, gifted, and disciplined. She also wasn’t wrong, here. Yesterday hadn’t been a time for applying brakes, for hesitation and judgment. It had been a time to do-or-to-die. She’d chosen to live and they had been called heroes for it.

“Maybe it’s easier to say it’s just a few bad Marines,” Ne'le conceded.

The commanding officer stiffened in response, like she was about to strike Ne’le. She was well within her rights to. “I accept what comes. Had I been a better leader…well, that’s leadership. You take risks. I should have accepted that sometimes that means looking inward, among your own ranks. At what we’re doing and turning on the antigrav, before we burn up on re-entry. Too much heat, too much speed. Like you said, not enough thought. Not enough awareness. Not enough judgment. Now it’s time for judgment.” Her words were a careful nod to the Interior’s role- one increasingly focused on rooting out wrongdoing within them. Insane to think that now she was among them.

That night had been a drunken haze of memories, as scattered as the garments had been around the room. She remembered saying no, or hearing it, and the way it had paused the room, as everyone came to grips with what they’d done. Things that felt impossible, like from the things she’d be ashamed to say she enjoyed or found herself curious about and worse, almost as if she herself hadn’t even experienced it. Surely, some coping mechanism- as if to beg her conscience: *‘You can’t hold yourself accountable for what surely you would never-’*

“You are to report to Maryland.”

A place worse than hell itself.

## Chubby Bunny

“So what’d you do to get shipped in to this Turox-shit assignment? Wasn’t any big loan that I know of. You know how to handle yourself, meaning you came from another red zone, didn’t ya?”

Ne'le stared up at her sergeant. How much worse could things get? Not worse than if she opened her mouth.

“Come on, out with it. No secrets here, soldier. That flicker over there? You wonder why we call her that?”

“It isn’t short for ‘clit-flicker’?” Ne'le blurted, and her new sergeant laughed. “Nah. It’s for what she did to get here. Hey, Flicker! C’mon, tell the newbie what you did!”

Without missing a beat on the nickname or a hint of sass, ‘Flicker’ spoke. “Lit a marshmallow on some memorial. Turns out they don’t like that.”

“We already had a ‘Marshmellow’ get caught in zero-g with a big fat pale white one. Absolutely cylindrical, he was.”

“What was so bad about that?” Not that she was in any position to talk about relations with boys.

“Aboard a *military* dropship, without clearance for either of them.”

“Ah.” She craned her neck. “That’s…insanely stupid.”

“You don’t get here by being smart.”

“Where’s ‘Marshmellow’?”

“She gave you her spot.”

“She got out of here?”

“Something like that. Now, what’d you do?”

So she told, professing neither innocence nor guilt, knowing they wouldn’t believe her any more than the tribunal, and that it wouldn’t make any difference either way.

“And you got a mouthful of him, huh?”

She stared at her sergeant. How was she taking this so undisturbed? Was the galaxy really like this? She supposed it was an awfully big galaxy, and it should have distressed her more to know how deep into the black she’d fallen in it.

“Yes ma’am.”

“Alright, got a name for her,” Flicker said. “‘Chubby Bunny’.”

The sergeant looked at her. “She ain’t that fat.”

“No, but…” she whispered something in the sergeant’s ear, and the longer she spoke, the more the sergeant’s grin grew until she cackled. “Okay, yes, it’s perfect. Alright, Chubby Bunny. You’re ‘CB’ on the comms, got it? Stick with Flicker, until I say otherwise.”

CB could only nod. “Got it.”

“You look surprised.”

“I just thought…you’d…” Did she dare say it and make it come true?

“You think you’re the first? Hell, you’re not even the only one in the pod to have that story. Welcome to The Depths.”

*****

## Cleanup Duty

“You know, I’m of an age where I could start doing these myself,” the young man said airily, washing his hands of the red blood that had landed on him.

“That would mean two, no wait. Three. Five…different things. None of them good,” the voice on the other end said, sounding like he was chewing with his mouth full.

“That says more about what you think of me than what I just said. I just know you’re busy, between maintaining the appearance of a budget, and doing your…well, let’s call it a job. Your nine to two, no wait, three…five…o’clock.”

“Very funny. Is that any way to treat the elderly?”

Vaugn conceded that twice his age was hardly ancient by not saying anything. He shouldn’t press Gavin. He owed the man his life, after all, but couldn’t help poking at the situation. The situation certainly needed some levity, after all.

“You know what his last words were?”

“Hm?”

“‘They looked sickened when I gave the evidence. Impressive stuff. What’s my next mission’?”

“And you’re okay…?”

“If he gets caught in an insurgent mask, he’s a loose end,” Vaughn had the decency to at least feign sadness about the fate of the hapless victim. “Unless you mean whether I was spotted. I’ll say, these guns don’t kill clean. You superheat blood with a lasgun round, it’s bursting out of them all hot, sticky, and red. I’m just cleaning it all off now, so yeah, either way, shouldn’t be an issue anymore.”

Gavin spared any further interrogatives on whether or not Vaughn was bothered by what he’d done, more soft chewing noises as he ate his pizza. “Convenient that it doesn’t leave forensics. We’re all set on our end. [*Thalia* ](https://i.imgur.com/NVEDRhI.png)is setting up with a private journalist who has connections to make sure this goes viral. I’ve already sent her the incident case number they gave him.”

“She’s going by [*Melpomene*](https://i.imgur.com/vPZidEq.png) now.” Of course she would, after Parker died. It also lined up with her work’s new angle.

Vaughn could just see the salacious headlines now.

The aliens were openly corrupt, after all. What difficulty would there be in hiring a hitman to an empire who routinely let bribes fly when it came to getting people on-base, sneaking off-base, or looking the other way for all manner of illegal activities, such as artefact theft, and potentially even human trafficking?

Completely believable.

Trump just dropped a bombshell ultimatum to Putin - arrange peace talks with Zelensky within 2 weeks or face ""massive sanctions and massive tariffs."" This comes right after Russian missiles hit a US-owned electronics factory in western Ukraine, injuring 15+ workers.

The Irony:

Trump claims Putin agreed to meet Zelensky

Russia's Foreign Minister says no meeting is planned

Putin apparently doesn't even recognize Zelensky as legitimate

What's at Stake:
Trump's threatening either severe economic punishment or completely stepping back, saying ""it's your fight."" Meanwhile, the factory that got hit employs 2,600+ people and makes coffee machines - not exactly military targets.

The Reality Check:
Despite Trump's Alaska summit with Putin last week, both sides remain miles apart on basic issues like territory and NATO membership. Russia wants Ukraine to give up entire regions, while Ukraine refuses to ""gift"" any land to Russia.

Bottom Line:
This feels like diplomatic theater while real people are getting bombed. Trump's given ultimatums before that went nowhere - will this time be different?

Calling fellow introverts. People who enjoy company and companionship, but are drained after new social interactions. Let's skip the small talk, skip everything, and just sit there enjoying each other's company. We’ll pick out a book for each other, hopefully something we wouldn’t have chosen on our own. 

We'll chat a little bit here on Reddit to get a feel for each other, and when we're ready we can trade photos. The next step will be a short video call to verify (safety first!). If we decide to go on the date, we’ll map out where we will go so we both know what to expect. 

We’ll start at a bookstore, taking our time as we peruse the spines lining the shelves. They all seem to be vying for our attention, don’t they? We’ll read author bios and front covers, waiting for just the right selection. After we’ve made our choices, we head out for a short walk and a coffee, and make our way to the park where we can talk over a bottle of wine m. At the end we’ll part ways, hopefully having planned our second date.

Your wedding day.



The wedding of Y/N and Lupusregina Beta. Soon you would be Y/N Y/LN-Beta. Hyphenating your last name with hers.



You had played this day over and over again in your head, and it had been planned for half a year.



So…why were you scared?



“Y/N? What's wrong\~su?” the werewolf sitting next to you asked as she rubbed your back attempting to sooth you in any way she could.



You were sitting next to Lupusregina on a couch in your tent behind the altar where you would soon be wed.



Now was it bad luck for the bride and groom to see each other before the ceremony? Traditionally yes.



But was anything about you two traditional? 



But to answer Lupusregina's question…You didn’t know. 



This was just…big. The biggest thing. One of the scariest yet comforting things you had ever done.



It made you anxious.



“...I understand. I feel…similar. I’m worried about if this will change us. Make things…worse.” Lupusregina spoke the words you thought.



Was this a mistake? Were you and her rushing too fast? Would this ruin things?



The bride looked out of the tent. You chose to follow her gaze and proceeded to see all the denizens of Nazarick you had come to know taking their seats. Obviously most of your human friends couldn’t come, but all of Nazarick had been given a day off to attend. 



Lupu had chosen Shizu, Entoma, Aura, Mare, and Aureole as her flower brigade. Usually weddings were much more gendered than this, but as mentioned you two lacked tradition for this ceremony. In fact you and her shared a bridal/groom party. Yuri Alpha, Solution Epsilon, and Narberal Gamma.



You and Lupusregina shared the same feelings at the core of this day. The change it presented was huge. The biggest change you had ever faced. 



There was some silence between you two as you thought. 



“Yeah…But I mean, when ya really think about it, is there any reason to be worried?” Lupusregina kicked her feet up on the coffee table in front of you both. 



You raised your eyebrows inquisitively. Was there a reason to be worried?



“I mean, what’s really changing? I love you and I’m gonna love you forever, you love me and you’ll love me forever.” Lupusregina spoke confidently as she held her arm possessively around you. 



“We’re just having a party where our love is the theme and cementing it.” She shrugged.



“So what’s changing at the end of it\~su?” She was right.



Wasn’t she?



“Of course I’m right\~su! I’m always right\~su!” That was debatable. 



“Wha-Hey\~su!” The wolf queen grappled you closer, and began to roughly rub her knuckles into your scalp. A classic Lupusregina noogie.



She laughed heartily as she finished the pre ceremony bullying. Leaning back with a sigh.



Suddenly Yuri Alpha entered your tent. She wore her own white dress. Not attempting to one up Lupusregina, the opposite in fact. 



“Everyone is present and accounted for. Shall we begin the ceremony?”



Lupusregina looked at you for confirmation.



You nodded sheepishly.



“Yes\~su! We shall!”



…



You were extremely lucky.



You thought this as you stared into the gold coated amber eyes of Lupusregina Beta.



Not just because you had met this sadistic, insane, adorable, lazy, mischievous, and sexy werewolf. 



Not just because she cruelly laughed when you asked her on a date.



Not just because she saved you from a mugging, with extreme prejudice. 



Not just because when the Wolf Queen was at her lowest, she ran to you.



Not just because Lupu gave you the confidence and reason to stand up to what was essentially a demigod in terms of strength, and your survival after the fact.



Not just because of how you were the only non supreme being to calm her down enough to head to the vet’s office.



Not just because she chose to drop the knee beyond the picture of her creator.



But because of how amazing today itself had gone.



Because Albedo and Shalltear made a truce to fight over the bouquet toss after the wedding, so they wouldn’t get Ainz dirty.



Because the Smiling Sadist somehow managed to keep her dress clean even while eating sour cream and onion dip by the spoonful.



Because Entoma ate all the pests for you and her.



Because Ainz Ooal Gown himself chose to officiate. 



Because of it all you were the luckiest human ever.



“Hello everyone. It is a pleasure to witness this sparkling turn out today.” Ainz spoke in the way only he could. Commanding presence and respect without so much as looking up from his sheet of notes.



“Here, under the sky Blue Planet spent countless hours sculpting to perfection, I am honored to wed together Lupusregina Beta and Y/N. I am overjoyed that the witnesses to this ceremony are you all. The creations of my greatest friends.”



“The bride and groom also wish to acknowledge all my friends. I swear, on the honor of Ainz Ooal Gown, they would be ecstatic and proud of each and every one of you.” There was a moment of silence as everyone thought of their creator before Ainz continued.



“About these two, I think it is plainly obvious of their power dynamic. Not just because Lupusregina has many more levels than Y/N, but because of how often they each showcase it. To add upon this, it also showcases their love for each other. I’m sure that if any other human gave Lupusregina this much power over them, they would not have survived even a day. Yet Y/N enjoys her protection…truly are you both star crossed.”



He turned slightly to Lupusregina, who in response handed off her bouquet of Red Rose’s, Lavender, and Black Rose’s.



“Lupusregina Beta. Do you promise to love Y/N forever?”



“I do.” She responded with a love sick grin as she gazed upon you.



He then turned to you.



“Y/N. Do you promise to love Lupusregina Beta forever?”



You did.



“And now the vows. I understand you both have custom one’s to share?” You and her nodded as you took out the prepared note cards.



“Y/N. I promise to become your wife from this day forward. I promise to always love you, heal you when you need it, to always care for you, to always protect and guard you. I promise to be with you forever.” 



You promised to become her husband from that day forward. You promised to always love her, honor her, cherish her, to always snuggle with her, to always tell her about your geeky interests. You promised to be with her forever.



“Now you have both shared your vows.”



He handed you your rings. Pure gold wedding bands which you slipped on each other’s fingers.



“I now officially declare you two married! You may kiss.”



The world stopped as she approached and pulled you down and slightly to the side as she kissed you.



It only lasted 50 seconds, but it felt like a lifetime. Her pillowy lips and sweet saliva pressed down on you in ecstasy.



“I present to you all, the newlyweds!” Ainz threw his arms out as Lupusregina picked you up and walked down the aisle holding you.



The applause was amazing as Lupusregina kissed you again.



“I love you\~su.” All you could do was reciprocate as you were carried off the 6th floor and into your married life…



THE END\~SU

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

If this resonates with you, send me a message.",1,1755911110.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1mxnzy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1mxnzy9/crushing_hard/,Crushing hard,"I recently moved out from my house this year. I didn’t think of dating or felt the rush to do so, I was fine. I then had a crush on my new friend, told them, we had so much in common, got in a relationship but I wasn’t the girlfriend, but this escalated fast. Seemed to god to be true, we actually didn’t have so much things in common, so I decided to end it after 2 months because I just didn’t wanted to be friends with benefits once we talked and they made clear what they offered in the relationship, it was going to be different from what we had at the beginning, not what I liked. Was my first queer relationship too, it started like a dream, it felt so beautiful at the beginning. I grieved this situationship like 2 months after the “break up”. 

I don’t know if it’s it because I moved out, or recently had a relationship that I’m crushing hard on this guy on my gym and wanting a relationship. I want to hold hands, all the romantic and physical things.

At my gym there is this guy. I don’t know his age nor his name. He is cute, my type in looks but I don’t know yet in personality. At the beginning I noticed him, but I didn’t cared about him in that way. 

Then later the crush started. Glances, him fixing his hair when I’m around. After going to the gym and walking in the streets I noticed if guys have long bangs or hair, they fix it when they see me close or at distance. He isn’t the only one doing this. Is this something guys do when they find someone attractive? 

The crush from the gym does it too, like every time we walk the same street, if he sees me from distance or close he fixes his hair. I think he is trying to meet me at the street too once we end working out. I meet him regularly now after I go out of the gym to buy bread a then I see him when I return. He usually did more than 20 minutes of cardio and we rarely meet, only when I did errands or shopping close, and then returned was when we meet… but now he does like 5-10 (I start first, then I finish, go out to buy bread then, he is there when we cross paths). Sometimes he finishes first and I still meet him after buying bread. 

One time he surprised me from behind and walked past me, I was hearing music and moving my hands to the beats and he was doing the same when I looked at his back.

But I don’t know if he is interested because I tried to smile at him and no response. He is like looking at the distance, or quickly moving his eyes to the front. One time I think I catched a smile, like him trying to suppress a laugh because I was smiling trying not to laugh too, I just find funny he always catches me eating bread after gym.

I want to know how to approach him, every time I do I chicken out. I just want to know if he is interested or not, just to move from this. I can’t stop thinking about him. Like crush is so bad now I’m trying to go to public places like coffee shops just for the chance to meet.

Mike here again, checking in after my first full week of ebike commuting. And let me tell you, this thing is a game-changer! Seriously, my life is officially better.

Remember how I was complaining about traffic and parking? Well, traffic can still suck it, because I’m zipping past all those cars. And my wallet is definitely happier without those crazy parking fees. Plus, I’m actually getting some exercise, feeling way less stressed, and honestly, feeling pretty good about doing my part for the planet. Every ride feels like a little win for Mother Earth! 🌍

But here’s the even cooler news: My buddy, who was also stuck in traffic purgatory, saw how stoked I was and went and got his own ebike! We went for our first ride together today, just cruising around, and it was awesome. It’s way more fun with a riding partner, you know?

Now that we’re both officially part of the ebike fam, we’re looking to explore beyond our commutes. We’re in Southern California, and we’re hungry for some good routes. We’re talking chill rides, scenic views, maybe a cool coffee shop or a beach stop along the way. Nothing too gnarly, just good vibes and good miles.  

**So, my fellow SoCal riders, what are your go-to routes?** Any hidden gems? Best beach paths? Trails with epic views? Any cool cycling routes your guys‘d recommend?

Hey fellow entrepreneurs, 

Hope you're all doing well! So, I've been 'vibe coding' since the Covid days. Yeah, it's been a crazy ride—full of late nights, endless cups of coffee, and lots of learning curves. I've seen some highs and lows, and I'm almost at the finish line with my startup! 🚀

I wanted to open up a discussion about our pandemic journeys. Have any of you started something new during these times? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? 

For me, one of the biggest lessons has been the importance of staying adaptable. Things change fast, and being able to pivot has been crucial. Another is the power of community—for advice, support, and sometimes just a good laugh when things get tough. 

I'd love to hear your stories, tips, and any advice you might have for those of us still hustling to make our dreams a reality.

Let's support each other and maybe even find some new connections here to grow our personal brands and ventures. Feel free to drop your stories below, and let’s keep the momentum going! 

Looking forward to hearing from you all! 😊

It’s a little tangy, but still really good, especially with mix ins. I know it probably wouldn’t bother most people, as it’s similar to Greek yogurt, but I just mixed coffee concentrate in it, and it brings a nice subtle mocha flavor, which cuts out the tang a lot, without any extra calories! 

So I highly suggest mixing a little coffee concentrate in your yogurt or whipped cottage cheese. I like to make my own concentrate, and you can also buy coffee concentrate. Mine is decaf so no worries about when I have it (i often eat a little of my mousse in the evening). I also love to use my coffee concentrate in my chocolate peanut butter protein shakes!
