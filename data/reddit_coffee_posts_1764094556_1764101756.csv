I was always curious about Dita as brand. After getting chance to review Dita mecha my feelings towards this brand changed. From being neutral to in favor of them. Dita is boutique brand which deals with DD sets. DD sets being my kryptonite I was mesmerised by Dita Mecha. For information about it please check my old review. Now coming to Dita project M I was very much interested to try it and so when opportunity to do so arise. I took shot. I requested AudioGeek India for review tour unit and I not only got unit but also other product from Dita, Dita Navigator. But my curiosity didn’t let me seat in patience. I had heard that Dita had made Activo Q1 based on Project M for Activo a sub brand of Astell & Kern. I pulled few strings and got my self Activo Q1. So, this review is going to be little different than my previous reviews as this will be a comparison between these sets with source being android phone + Dita Navigator as DAC & AMP.

Before we start let me thank AudioGeek India, Sandeep bhai the man behind AudioGeek family, Dita audio & my close friend (wants to be anonymous) who graciously lent me the Activo Q1. Without them this review wouldn’t have been possible.

What are my biases? Well I like DD > Hybrids > Planars. Also please see my music choices in my music genre section. Please keep this in mind while reading this review.

I haven’t been paid or been compensated in any way to write this review. This review is my personal opinion and all thoughts and opinions are mine.

Now that all pleasantries are done. Let’s proceed to meat and potatoes of this review.

Since this review will encompass three products & these products have launched a while back also you can easily find out details regarding what’s included in the box and contents from elsewhere, I will be skipping it. This will help us keep it concise and on point.

Please note I will use PM as shortcut to address Project M in this review.

Comfort & Fit:

As this only applies for iems i will be only discussing about them. Dita PM and Activo Q1 are identical in shell shape and build quality. Shells are medium size. They fit very well. Being made up of resin they are light weight. Nozzles are big yet not too big to hurt ears. Nozzles have lips to hold ear tips in place. So, no slipping off ear tips. No weird pain or soreness felt even after using them for hours together. Yes, the included ear tips are final type E for both.

Cable is also exactly same for both. Its modular cable with both 3.5mm and 4.4 mm jacks which are exchangeable. Cable is supple and does get tangled very easily. Cable feels premium and goes with the theme. Both jack terminations are felt sturdy. Ear hooks don’t tug on the iems. So iems stay in place.

   

 



Ear tips:

Ear tips used for this review are Final Type E which come default with both sets. This is to ensure standardisation in evaluation.



Sources:

Source again has been kept to only Dita Navigator to keep standardisation while evaluation. Navigator is neutral tuned. Build quality is to envy. Its solid built. All metal and with nifty additions such as phone stand and crafty screwdriver. I have never seen such more thoughtful product.

Navigator has independent volume control than source. The volume steps can be bit big on sensitive gear. Wherein you might find it becoming bit loud in small increment. It is very powerful dongle it ran my Sennheiser HD600 effortlessly.

Overall great product wish it was on sell would grab one myself.





Music Genre Used for this Review:

Sound Impressions:

Bass/Lows:

Dita PM

Bass here is clean and fast type. It Favors mid bass over sub bass. Sub bass is less, and you feel it while listening. You can feel and hear thump of mid bass. Generally, I am more of mid bass over sub bass guy. Yet I also like bit of sub bass in the mix. That anaemic sub bass here is bit deal breaker.

Tonality of drums and bass guitars get affected due to tuning choice. They don’t feel emphatic.

Overall Bass/Lows 4/5


Activo Q1

Bass here also is clean and fast type. But main difference you pick up is that Q1 has bit more sub bass than Dita PM. Mid bass also feels bit more than Dita M. Here you can get the impact of mid bass along with the rumble of sub bass. Mind you this is not night and day difference. Overall difference is very minute. You can achieve it via EQ probably. Please don’t hold me to it as I never use EQ. Coming to Drums and bass guitars, they feel better than Dita PM.

Overall Bass/Lows 4.5/5



Mids:

Dita PM

Vocals are the star here. Both male and female vocals shine. Female vocals more so than male. High pitch female vocals can be troublesome for some specifically those who are susceptible to female poison. Sibilance is there. The “s” “t” “Ch' are pronounced. Vocal reverberations are on point. Instruments in Mids sound good. There is felt clarity in instruments.

Overall Mids 4.5/5

Activo Q1

vocals are also star here. Male and female vocals both shines. Female vocals can be intense. Yet less compared to Dita PM. Sibilance is in check here. Vocal reverberations are on point. Instruments in Mids sound good. The felt clarity in Instruments is less than Dita PM.

Overall Mids 4.5/5

Treble/Highs:

Dita PM

All Macro and micro details present here. If you are detail chaser you can find them here. Wide soundstage. Width and height both are above average. No smearing of instruments. All of them sound separately and properly layered. None compete for space. Out of head experience. One of those iems which tries to get close to that out of head experience headphones can only provide.
Yet this can get very intense. I would recommend people sensitive to treble to demo before purchase.

Overall Treble/highs 4.5/5


Activo Q1

same as the Dita PM it has all the details you look for. All macro and micro details are there. Wide soundstage and equal height. Yet it has less airy feeling than Dita PM. You feel somehow there is something less here compared to Dita PM but only if you compare it to it. On its own its one of the smooth treble tuned iems. I find it smoother than Dita PM in this regard. Instrument separation is as good as Dita PM. Same out of head experience is here also available. This doesn’t get intense so you can enjoy bit more than Dita PM.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5



Song Impressions:

Angel by Massive attack

Dita PM

on PM the sub bass rumble is very much missing. You can’t feel it or hear it the way it should be. Drumbeats are okay. This song is good to check the sub bass and mid bass performance of the iems. No congestion in instruments, no smearing. Soong can be enjoyed yet it’s not the best reproduction.

Activo Q1

on Q1 you can hear and feel bit of sub bas. It rumbles bit. Drumbeats are better than PM. Treble presentation here feels smoother than PM. These are not lacking details. I like the presentation here more than Dita PM.


Anjane by Strings

Dita PM
 
This song has one of the best string music for long time. Here the string reverberations are bit less. Guitars sound good. Drums sound good. Sounds bit wider than Q1. Vocals are great. No congestion in instruments. String instruments can get bit intense here compared to Q1.

Activo Q1

Here vocals are equally great. Guitars don’t sound harsh and sound great. String reverberations are good not great. Drums sound great compared to PM. There is no congestion or smearing. Overall, I liked the song presentation on Q1 better than PM.



No Time To Die by Bilie Eilish

Dita PM

Bilie's seductive voice is amazing in this song and on Dita Pm it sounds even better. Piano notes are good but lack the note weight. Rest instruments like drums shakers are good. I was surprised to notice shakers prominently in the mix. A faint trace of sibilance can be found in Bilie's voice. Overall great reproduction.

Activo Q1

Here the difference in Bilie's voice is almost impossible to make out as she sounds same on both sets. Piano notes sound bit better here. No sibilance in her voice. Soundstage feels little less here compared to Dita PM. Rest of the instruments sound similarly like Dita PM. Drums Sound bit better. Shakers are also easy to detect in the mix. Overall good reproduction.


Kashmir by Marcin
 
Dita PM

The inadequacy of sub bass is noticeable. Mid bass slam is good. Strings sound good. No compression or smearing considering how fast pace the song is. Bit more clarity than Activo Q1. Good reproduction minus the sub bass rumble.

Activo Q1

Here you can hear and feel bit of sub bass rumble but not enough. Yet better than Dita PM. strings are good. You can enjoy more here as there is just enough bass to complement the strings. No compression or smearing is felt. Clarity feels bit less than Dita PM. Overall better reproduction than Dita PM.



Final Conclusion:

Dita PM is great set if you like to analyse music. It can do that to great extent. It’s great to find things you never heard in the song you have listened 100's of time. Yet finding them a new due to these micro details is joy. If you lie this then Dita PM is for you.
	
Activo Q1 can be said as warmer Dita PM it has more sub bass and mid bass compared to it. The treble is lot smoother. Thus, this turns into a detailed set with quality bass. Here also bass is not enough to satisfy bass heads.

Dita PM is for the people who prefer neutral bright tuning and not for bass heads. Treble heads will also like this set. Activo Q 1 is for neutral warm lovers who don’t want brightly tuned treble. So, this is not for treble heads and bass heads. Yet both these sets can be used for almost all genres minus the bass dominant genres. For my personal preference I like the Activo Q1.

Dita Navigator is amazing product. I don’t understand why Dita is not selling it? I think it would be another banger for them. A nice tuned neutral dongle with build quality of tank and thoughtful additions.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now grab a cup of coffee and let’s dive back into our beloved music.

1p6mxdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1p6mxdn/i_think_my_dad_is_autistic/,i think my dad is autistic,"Just a disclaimer before i begin - I am not asking for a diagnosis or advice, i just want to say this, i would NEVER use autism as an insult, i don't view it as something undesirable or odd, i fully support autistic people and my following suspicions are not confimed to be autistic behavious I am just expressing what i am expecting. and, in addition the qualities i am about to mention do not automatically mean autism or anything.

  
So my dad's a little different than the other dads. he doesn't have friends and i think he struggles to make friends because since he was young he was constantly moving schools, here there because his parents were doctors. so he never really had friends and he went to a basically all white boarding school where he experienced extreme racism and was beat up by the older kids and im guessing from the age of 13-18 he had no friends. that... is detrimental

another thing is, he doesn't show any emotion. he's extremely awkward with emotion and doesnt know how to hug and doesn't seem to understand love we see in movies. he didnt have a girlfriend until he was in his late thirties and his first gf was my mum . He didn't date purely out of seeing no need to

he has never cried. never ever in front of me or my mum, even at his brother's funeral he did not cry just stood there. hes incapable of showing sadness or vulnerability. when i was smaller and used to cry he would tell me to stop because it achieves nothing apparently. he's had so many bad things happen to him and hes not cried once in the past 40 years or something

he covers his ears when there's slightly loud noise. he developed this habit when my mum , sister and i would shout a lot and now when he sits down his hand is permanently next to his ear in case he needs to cover it quickly to shield from noise. and then he plugs his ears

he just cant comprehend emotion and doesn't see a annoying repetitive behaviour he has is annoying. recently every single day he tells me that im wasting time and i should go and study as if im not thinking about this enough and i just had an outburst on him getting so mad because i tell him to stop every day and he just treats it like a joke and will do the same thing the next day because he genuinely doesn't understand why im mad

another thing is that he wont speak up during a conversation and will zone out if hes not interested but as soon as theres something hes interested about he wont stop talking. also hes very fixated on transport and knows all the roads within a 10 mile radius of us and will know the exact route without gps for a 1+ hour journey somewhere. hes obsessed with planes and knows the models and if he hears one he'll run outside into our garden to look at it

he brushes his teeth 3 times a day and really oddly letting the toothpaste run down his hand and make weird faces to reach teeth . and has designated eating times/ coffee times and will eat cornflakes at 9pm or so everyday. also he organises things very specifically on his desk/ on the floor/ on shelves

and to new people he does seem very blunt. one time we met another young lady and he almost seemed like he was interrogating her instead of being curious but he just didn't know he was coming off as that

other than that, hes very intelligent and capable in general. it wouldn't be obvious externally just living with him makes us realise this. and he refuses to even consider it and takes it as a joke when we would tell him we think he has it.

They didn’t really ask me any real technical questions during my interview, it was more like one sided chitchat where they’d ask me a question, interject me while I was answering or answer their question by themselves. 🚩🚩🚩I was willing to brush it off since it was at a small business where the employers clearly had no practice with interviewing candidates before. It felt more like I was attending a lecture and less of an interview. They kept reiterating that me and the other junior hire were young so that was “suitable” for them. I was told I’m overqualified for the role but lowballed within the same breath.😹 

Since I’m early in my career and I want to build my work experience I was alright with working my way around the red flags. From day 1 they had been nudging me & another recent junior hire to make or serve coffee / tea for the senior staff at the company. A few days into my new job I saw a senior management staff throw a full on temper tantrum and shout at the office administrator for something that was so immaterial (not serving coffee to clients). We were gobsmacked to say the least but I was reassuring myself by telling myself that it’s just how the world is and you deal with this stuff for the character development. I was basically just in it for the plot.

A few weeks later my manager tells me they wanna “extend my probation” which was already unpaid to what I presumed would be few more days of unpaid labor. They expressed that they’d be willing to pay me on a “pro-rata basis”. But they made no attempts to formalize this uncouth extension or put it down in writing. I was also really amused by the fact that they’d wanna extend my probation despite me doing my tasks well and within stipulated timeframes, with no complaints from my reporting manager. They also seemingly set me to fail with ridiculous last minute tasks on a software I was very transparent about not being proficient in during my interview. It seemed to me that I’d made a few enemies since I didn’t want to make coffee for someone’s 480 month old (40 year old) baby or engage in meaningless conversation while at work. I’d had enough by this point.

I had good reason to believe they were fooling around and had no intentions to pay me for any of the work I’d been doing. And even if they wanted to confirm me, I wouldn’t want to be part of a team like that one. Put my papers in and haven’t looked back.🥱🥱🥱",3,1764100910.0,dubai,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the yung gravy show at the clyde on 11/28. that bluffton road area can be a nightmare when a big show hits, plus there's some construction making things even trickier.  
  
my top tip, honestly, is to check out Prked. this is the local app for renting private driveways and empty garage spots. seriously, it's a game changer for the clyde. you can often find a spot that's way cheaper than any paid lot and it lets you skip the main congestion lines entirely, turning a parking war into a five minute walk.  
  
now for the official options, which are also free. the clyde has a massive 6-acre parking lot along bluffton road and right behind the theater. if that fills up, which it definitely might for this show, your official overflow spot is in front of and behind the foster park plaza retail center just to the west. get there early to snag one of those spots- they suggest getting there early anyway, maybe grab a pre-show bite at the club room or crescendo coffee & more right there.  
  
super important heads up: there is ongoing road construction on bluffton road and the bridge, so your usual route might be messed up. definitely check for detours and alternate traffic routes before you leave, especially if you're coming in from downtown or i-69. giving yourself an extra half hour of travel time is key to avoiding a total meltdown.  
  
if you really want to lock in a spot ahead of time, look on the resale sites like seatgeek or viagogo- sometimes they have prepaid parking passes for the clyde lots. it can cost a little more than face value, but it guarantees you won't be circling for an hour and is good for peace of mind.  
  
finally, whatever you do, do not try to sneak park in the residential streets and especially don't park on any grass or unapproved surfaces. fort wayne has municipal codes for that, and you could get hit with a $100 ticket, which is way more than any parking spot will cost you. stick to paved lots.  
  
hope this helps everyone get their gravy fix without the parking stress!",1,1764100910.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

For context: I come from an olive growing family in an agricultural producing country, so I’m really intentional about where my money goes. I’m looking for a roaster or subscription that genuinely centers the grower/producer’s story and agency (not just as a marketing afterthought), and really tries to express the innate beauty of the bean itself through the origin, terroir, processing, all of it.

I also strongly prefer delicate, clean, light roasts that highlight complexity and nuance. I am currently on the Flowerchild 1 bag sub and love it and am looking for another bag sub to last me through the months.

Any recommendations for subscriptions or roasters that fit this philosophy?",1,1764100890.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

Long time lurker, first time poster. I’ve relied heavily on this sub for motivation, knowledge, tips from experience etc and felt it was my turn to reciprocate. 

Tips: you can’t outrun a bad diet. Even at my heaviest I was regularly (3-5x per week) going to the gym to get cardio in via elliptical or stair machine. Heart health was good but still so obese. I blamed literally everything else except diet. Go figure. Now people are asking how I lost weight and they’re like “and you go to the gym?” And I’m like yeah, I always did though. I’m just eating less! No-one wants to hear that cos it’s boring. 

For me the tipping point was deciding that it’s a matter of self-discipline and not motivation. I saw a cartoon about this and it resonated with me. From that point on I was locked in. Regular exercise and count every damn calorie I put in my mouth. Just do it. In an unironic way thanks Nike. 

Getting my cardio in first thing in the morning. I’m at the gym and on the elliptical/treadmill before my body/mind has a chance to object and request drinking coffee on the sofa with the dog. Being a woman of a certain age, early wakings are a thing for me and I may as well use the time. Getting most of the work done early makes me feel good for the rest of the day. Plus, after a full day of teaching it’s REALLY tough to get me to the gym (getting easier as I get lighter though!). I also take beta blockers (for migraines) and need to get my heart rate up before I take them otherwise it just wouldn’t be able to get up there! 

Trust the process. I’ve had weeks of stalls. Could be hormones, sodium, doing weights, whatever. I just need to tell myself each time to trust the process. Stay locked in and keep track of those stoopid little calories. This was when I was grateful for other stories about plateaus, so thanks team! 

I don’t have a goal weight, I’m just going to keep going until I reach what feels like a healthy weight/bmi. I’m really happy with my fitness and continuing that journey (goal is to be able to do a pull-up!). Other fitness goals are around surviving a zombie apocalypse lol … it keeps me on track!

Ok, that’s me. I hope that something here clicked for someone and you can take away something in your heart/brain that gets you through the next bit of your journey. Kā kite ano 🙌",9,1764100868.0,loseit,0,1.0,False
1p6mrvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1p6mrvu/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1764100849.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

That is not to say we weren’t Mormon at all, but my parents definitely allowed things that typical “good” Mormons didn’t do ie. drinking coffee, wearing “immodest” clothes etc. We lived pretty secular but still went to church, general conference, got baptized. All in all to say, though we were abnormal, we were still expected to honor and love God and believe in the Church.
I’m 19. A few months back, I found a bottle of champagne in our fridge in the garage. I jokingly asked my mom about it and she told me her friends asked her to hold onto it because their husbands would get upset or something of that sort. I went with it because, to be fair, I know her friends and they ARE a bit crazy on their alcohol, more than people should be. I’m not talking causal drinks or anything, they get blackout as 40 year old women anyways, didn’t care.

*""She's so naive, isn't she? Poor little small-town girl has no idea what's happening right under her nose.""*

Nathan's response: *""Let's keep it that way for now.""*

The phone slipped from my numb fingers, clattering onto the hardwood floor. The shower was still running. He had no idea I'd seen everything.

When Nathan emerged twenty minutes later, towel wrapped around his waist, hair still dripping, I was sitting exactly where he'd left me. But everything had changed.

""Hey, babe."" He smiled that easy, familiar smile that had charmed me for nine years. ""You look pale. Everything okay?""

I held up his phone. ""We need to talk.""

His face went through a series of micro-expressions—surprise, panic, then something that looked almost like relief. ""Emily, I can explain—""

""Explain what, exactly?"" My voice came out steadier than I felt. ""Explain how you've been meeting Chloe behind my back for weeks? Explain how she calls me naive and you agree? Explain how you have a secret spot together?""

Nathan sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, suddenly looking older than his twenty-seven years. ""It's not what it looks like.""

""Then what is it, Nathan? Because it looks like you're having an affair with our neighbor.""

""It's not an affair!"" He ran his hands through his wet hair, droplets scattering. ""Chloe's going through a rough time. Her ex left her with massive debt, she's struggling to make rent—she needed someone to talk to.""

""And that someone had to be my fiancé?""

""She doesn't have anyone else, Em. She's alone in this city, just like we were when we first moved here. I was just being a good neighbor.""

I stared at him, searching his face for the man I'd loved since I was eighteen. ""Good neighbors don't have secret meeting spots, Nathan. Good neighbors don't call their friend's girlfriend naive behind her back.""

""You're being paranoid."" His voice took on that dismissive tone I'd been hearing more and more lately. ""This is exactly what Chloe said would happen—that you'd get jealous and insecure if you found out I was helping her.""

""She predicted this?"" The words came out as a whisper. ""You two discussed how I'd react?""

""Emily, you're spiraling. This is your insecurity talking, not logic."" He reached for my hands, but I pulled them away. ""Chloe is going through hell right now. She needs support, and I'm not going to abandon someone who needs help just because my girlfriend can't handle me having a female friend.""

The casual cruelty of it hit me like a slap. ""A female friend who calls me naive? Who talks about what a good actor you are? Who says poor little small-town girl?""

Nathan's jaw tightened. ""You went through my entire conversation history?""

""That's what you're focusing on? My invasion of privacy, not your emotional affair?""

""It's not an affair!"" He stood up abruptly, the towel nearly slipping. ""God, Emily, this is exactly why I didn't tell you about helping her. I knew you'd blow it out of proportion.""

""Blow it out of proportion?"" I felt something dangerous rising in my chest—a fury I'd never allowed myself to feel before. ""Nathan, you've been lying to me for weeks. Meeting another woman in secret. Sharing intimate conversations. Making plans behind my back. What part of that is proportional?""

""She needed someone to talk to about her problems—""

""Then why didn't you tell me? Why all the secrecy if it was so innocent?""

He was quiet for a long moment, and in that silence, I heard everything he wasn't saying.

""Because you knew it wasn't innocent,"" I said softly. ""You knew exactly what you were doing.""

""Emily—""

""We're getting married in a month, Nathan. One month. And you're having secret coffee dates with another woman, letting her call me naive, agreeing that I'm some clueless small-town girl who doesn't know what's happening in her own relationship.""

He sat back down, suddenly looking defeated. ""It's complicated.""

""No, it's not."" I stood up, surprised by how steady my legs felt. ""It's actually very simple. Either you want to marry me, or you don't. Either you respect me, or you don't. Either you're committed to this relationship, or you're not.""

""Of course I want to marry you. Em, you're everything to me—""

""Then prove it."" The words came out harder than I intended. ""Cut contact with Chloe. Completely. No more secret meetings, no more being her emotional support system, no more anything.""

Nathan's face changed. Something stubborn and defensive flickered in his eyes. ""I can't just abandon her when she needs help.""

""But you can abandon me?""

""That's not what I'm doing.""

""Isn't it?"" I grabbed his phone again, scrolling to find the message that had hurt most. ""Here. 'Let's keep it that way for now.' Keep what that way, Nathan? Keep me in the dark? Keep me looking like a fool?""

His phone buzzed in my hand. Another message from Chloe: *""Can't sleep. Thinking about our conversation today. You always know exactly what to say to make me feel better.""*

I held the screen toward him. ""Still think this is just friendship?""

Nathan looked at the message, then at me, and I saw something I'd never seen before in his eyes—not guilt, not remorse, but irritation. As if I was the problem. As if I was the one being unreasonable.

""Emily, you're making this into something it's not. Chloe is vulnerable right now, and I'm not going to kick her when she's down just because you can't handle me having compassion for someone else.""

The words hung in the air between us like a challenge. And for the first time in nine years, I wondered if the man I was supposed to marry in thirty-two days was someone I even knew at all.",1,1764100340.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1p6mhch,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p6mhch/gf_25f_wants_to_break_up_because_of_my_25m_sexual/,gf [25F] wants to break up because of my [25M] sexual fantasies,"tl;dr my gf wants to split up because I’ve admitted that I have brief sexual fantasies about friends or acquaintances

My gf and I have been going through a rough patch. We’ve been seeing each other for 1.5 years and officially dating for just over 1 year.

Part of it stems from her not feeling as loved or prioritized as she should be, and I’ve been actively working on that. I’ve been trying to do more to match her love languages (acts of service, thoughtful gifts, being more emotionally present). And I thought things were improving

A large source of tension has been my women friendships. I have never cheated, consider cheating a moral failure, and would never want to disrespect my partner like that. I have many friends who are girls from prior to us meeting. Some (not all) of them I’ve had crushes on in the past and have since moved on from, but we remain friends and still catch up 1:1, for coffee or brunch or over text. Things are and will continue to be strictly platonic with my friends. In my mind, my crushes or sexual attraction did not materialize into anything for a good reason and me not pursuing them while I was single indicates that I would not during my relationship. It would also be a betrayal of the friendship, since it would mean I’ve been essentially lying to my friends about the nature of our connection.

To give context, my girlfriend gets pretty insecure and anxious when I hang out 1:1 with my friends who are girls. She only really started opening up about feeling uncomfortable about it recently, and I thought it was because she sometimes didn’t know the other person or because I didn’t give a lot of context to her about my friendship. I sort of expected a foundation of trust from her, which looking back I should have done more to be transparent or cautious about these things. When she would confront me I would get defensive because I felt I was accused of things that I didn’t actually do or intend on doing. I felt like the jealousy was unfounded and there was never flirting or emotional cheating. Looking back, the optics were not great. One time was going to a club with a group of all girls where I stayed late because I was making sure they got home safe without giving very comprehensive updates to my gf. One time I grabbed dessert from the grocery store before dinner for my friend who was complaining about bad period cramps. I definitely could have done more to assuage my gf’s anxiety and fears, and I acknowledge that on paper it sounds sus. I feel like I was trying to be a more thoughtful or supportive person all-around and be a good friend. But I now am trying to intentionally put my partner’s needs and boundaries first. I committed to being careful to give my gf context about the friend I’m meeting beforehand and be more attentive if she expresses discomfort.

So fast forward to last night, it comes up in conversation like “oh do you look at other girls” or “do you think about your girl friends in a sexual way”. I am not super comfortable admitting this, but I have fantasized and mentally visualized sexual acts with my friends or strangers or people on the internet. This has happened before and during our relationship.  I also had a porn habit/addiction that I have attempted to break twice because my gf felt uncomfortable with me lusting at other women (this last time I’ve been successful because she gave me an ultimatum). I have viewed sexual fantasies as benign because I brush them to the side and they don’t materialize into real feelings or action.

I also haven’t shared these fantasies in the past because conventional wisdom says it can only make her upset to hear. My girlfriend is more sexually conservative than me, doesn’t really have sexual desires when we are apart, doesn’t think about sex outside of the context of a partner. She was sorta interrogating me to figure out if she feels comfortable with that knowledge and if we should break up or not. I reluctantly admitted to these fantasies and assured her they are not frequent and are meaningless intrusive thoughts that sometimes arouse me and sometimes don’t. My view on fantasies is they do not necessarily imply intent or subconscious desire, but we don’t see eye to eye on that. For her, it’s emotional or mental cheating that I reserved or compartmentalized a part of me for other women, and that I didn’t love her as fully as she does.

She’s been having a tough time dealing with this information and wants to break up today. I feel like we both still love each other, and I want to make this work, if possible. Has anyone gotten past this type of insecurity? Is there something more I can do to help assuage her fears? Can we compromise on this?",1,1764100193.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m giving away some free tokens so people can try it without committing. If you’ve got 5–10 minutes, see whether the workflow actually helps you write more (not less). You can even turn a short life story into a simple PDF just to test it out.

If you try it, I’d appreciate honest feedback. Would you pay a “coffee price” monthly for something like this?

now the reason i prefer f is because ive pretty much been raised by women: my 3 older sisters, my mom, 9 aunts, and the only cousins my age were also women. so my whole life i've gotten along better with women than men.

1p6mcau,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessDevelopment/comments/1p6mcau/customer_appreciation_days_they_work/,Customer Appreciation Days .. They work.,"**The Party Paradox**

When you invite friends to your home for a birthday, anniversary party, or a back yard barbecue, you don’t charge them. You give them food, music, drinks, amazing atmosphere and your full attention. They may bring a small gift, maybe a bottle of wine, because gratitude flows both ways.

Now here’s the paradox: Your customers are the reason you can even afford to throw those parties in the first place… ***but most businesses never throw one for them.***

We treat friends like guests and customers like transactions. More often than not, our friends ask for discounts or we feel obligated to give them a special price. ***It’s backwards.***

But, what if you flipped it?

What if you started *hosting* for your customers, not just selling to them? That’s **C·A·D - T.R.U.S.T.** And it runs on one simple equation:

Care × Recognition = Trust × Infinity

It’s not marketing. It’s emotional economics. And it works.

**The Real-World Proof -** ***My Personal True Stories:***

***Fitness Clubs ""Cheat Days""***

One day, I set up a surprise pizza table right in the middle of the gym. No posters. No announcements. Just the smell of melted cheese drifting through the air.

People who’d worked out side by side for months suddenly started talking, laughing, sharing stories and most importantly connecting. Trainers had the easiest conversation starter in the world: *“Enjoy the calories now, and see you at class Thursday!”* Staff and members stood shoulder to shoulder, laughing over a slice of pizza.

Renewals and referrals followed - not because of discounts, but because everyone felt they belonged and loved the social aspect.

***Restaurants ""The Random Table Doctrine""***

Years ago, when I was “managing on the floor” during a busy dinner service, I decided to do something spontaneous. I picked a few tables, completely at random and told the waiter, *“Bring them the chef’s dessert (it was not just a desert it was a masterpiece of design, but only cost a few dollars), on the house. No reason. Just because, and say, we truly appreciate you”*

When the plates arrived, the guests looked stunned. Then came the laughter, the selfies, the gratitude. You could feel the atmosphere in the whole room shift - curiosity, joy, connection. They left smiling and posting. The sharing and the stories brought in more new guests than any paid ad ever did.

Because kindness spreads faster than marketing.

***Extended:***

There’s another side to this that most people miss. Appreciation doesn’t just create connection; it can also calm chaos.

I owned and have worked in many locations over the years, I learned to sense when the kitchen was about to hit its breaking point, with a full house when not expected. On those nights, instead of panicking, I turned it into an opportunity. We’d send out complimentary appetizers, something warm liked grilled veggies, some spiced olives, fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, something simple and fast (often the prep cook was able to prepare) but elegantly presented like it was “a gift from the chef”.

Guests instantly relaxed. They had something to nibble on, conversations flowed, and second rounds of drinks before the main course arrived. What could’ve been frustration became comfort, and comfort always turns into loyalty.

The truth is, those **“C·A·D”** moments didn’t just protect the guest experience; they protected the team, too. Because when you anticipate a problem and turn it into a gesture, it doesn’t feel like crisis management, it feels like care and 9 times out of 10 our sales ratio was higher than usual per table.

And that’s exactly what **C·A·D - T.R.U.S.T.** is meant to do: *turn everyday pressure into memorable experience.*

***Retail ""Forget the 10%""***

One afternoon with a client, we introduced my concept, “*Forget the discounts”.* Instead of giving a discount, we handed them a small gift, a pair of branded socks that could be matched with the pants, but were a little different than just a pair of plain old socks. They were funky and cool.

The customer looked surprised, almost confused at first, then smiled. It felt like they’d just received something worth 40% more, even though the cost to the shop was exactly the same as the 10% discount. They walked out holding that tiny bag embossed with “we appreciate you”, like it meant something more than just a pair of socks, and it did.

Because they didn’t leave with a discount. They left with a story.

***B2B ""The Random Box""***

Once or twice per month, I randomly decided to add an extra box of products to all the client’s orders that day, no reason, no promotion, just because. The next day, I always received many messages from clients with such positive energy on the phone. Then surprise, minimum 1 new account within a week was the average, telling me they were recommended by friends.

That small act - a single unexpected gesture - spread faster than any ad campaign.

Because generosity travels at the speed of trust.

***Hotels "" A little gift""***

At checkout, I loved watching faces light up when we slipped in a little extra small departure gift; maybe snacks for their drive or flight waiting time or an embroidered towel or freshly made desert and coffee for the road. There was no pattern, no promotion, just kindness pure and simple.

Every day, someone walked out a little lighter, a little happier, not because they spent money, but because someone *noticed* them.

Kindness is rare. So, I made it a mission to make the most of it as often as possible.

***Spas ""The Drive-Home Moment""***

Many times, after a massage or spa treatment, I’d hand guests a tiny beautifully wrapped chocolate or a homemade cookie and say, *“When you leave, while driving play your favorite song, devour this treat, and remember how relaxed you felt and how much you are appreciated by the entire team here”.*

They’d smile, not because of the chocolate - but because of the care behind it. That simple sensory link - taste, sound, memory - anchored the entire experience.

They might forget the brand name one day, but they’ll never forget how that moment made them *feel.*

*And then there are businesses that sell something you can’t wrap such as expertise, time, and trust, yet they hold enormous value.*

***Alternate/ Service-based ""The networking effect""***

When you’re in a service-based business, you can replace gifts with access. And that’s often worth far more.

I’ve always believed that the best way to thank your customers is to help them grow, too. So instead of offering discounts, I started hosting small, unannounced gatherings, not for anniversaries or holidays, but simply because I appreciated the people who trusted us. We’d call a few clients, partners, and friends who we felt had good synergies, tell them to drop by for drinks or snacks or just some beautiful desserts (often provided for free from one of my own clients wanting to promote their new products), and of course some great conversation. That was it. No agenda. No pitch. Just connection.

The magic always happened in the middle of the room, when two of our clients who’d never met realized they could help each other. Deals were made, collaborations started, friendships formed. At that moment, we weren’t the host of an event, we were the connector of opportunities.

A Decade ago, I launched something similar called “Who Am I?” at a private club I managed. Every month, a few members got five minutes on stage to present their businesses to others. The first night, 20 people showed up. Within 2-3 months, it was 5 times that, complete with wine tastings, networking, and laughter. Ten years later, to the best of my knowledge that event still exists.

That’s what Customer Appreciation Days can look like for service-based businesses. You don’t need a marketing budget, just curiosity, generosity, and the courage to bring people together. Because when your clients start meeting through you, they never forget who made it happen.

**The Barter Advantage**

You don’t need big budgets to build appreciation. You can barter with cafés, bakeries, restaurants, florists, even gyms and cross promote. They provide the gifts; you provide visibility and shared stories.

Everybody wins:

·        Customers leave with something tangible.

·        Local partners gain exposure.

·        Your brand becomes the connector, not the consumer.

When you’re standing around that surprise table; sharing stories, laughter, and coffee, you’re not selling. You’re connecting. And connection always sells better than a script.

**The Law of the Great Party**

Every business is a house. Every customer is a guest. If you want them to keep coming back, make it worth remembering.

“Throw great parties, not great discounts”. Because nobody raves about 10% off - but everyone raves about how you made them *feel*.

That’s **C·A·D - T.R.U.S.T.** in motion.

**Closing Reflection**

Trust isn’t built overnight. It’s earned through empathy, consistency, and care that compounds.

When customers start feeling like friends, it’s no longer a transaction, it’s a relationship. And relationships don’t churn, they return.

Discounts fade from memory. **T.R.U.S.T. leaves its own signature.**",1,1764099891.0,BusinessDevelopment,0,1.0,False

There are 3 couples and me and 2 guys are single. I started to like this one guy more and more after a couple of months of being in the group (we all got friends just a year ago).

I am a photographer, so he got a photoshoot from me around 7 months ago. I offered him to watch a movie at his place afterwards and we had a lovely day (he also bought us food in a restaurant). It was nice, but no romantic moments. Later I asked him to the museum and he said yes, tho he didn’t want to have a lunch together afterwards.

I realised the coldness from him and tried to not push further, as back then he divorced less than a year ago.

Closer to the summer I noticed that he wants to interact with me more - when we had some group discussions in the friends chat, he could go to my private messages to discuss something more. Sending reels/replying to my stories. Also it was always nice to talk to him during our friends gatherings, and on the way home.

In september he had a birthday and I gave him a t-shirt specifically made for him with a quote he mentioned a few months before that.

He also can message something after these friends gatherings to me.

A few weeks ago he said we had a nice conversation during the friends gathering, and offered to meet up for coffee to discuss more. But then there was a trouble in the public transportation and he decided not to come to the city (we supposed to meet before the friends gathering and he didn’t come for both). And then I left for the vacation and got back and he didn’t get back to the idea of meeting up just for two of us.

We share some interest, he seems very gentle and empathic, he’s very smart and intelligent. I really would love to be with someone like him. I understand his divorce story and therefore the coldness towards me, but some small interactions when he’s interested in me or we discuss something that’s interesting for both of us make me more and more attracted to him.

Do you think it’s something that can develop (given that he’s initiating small talks and even offered to meet up for the first time a couple of weeks ago, but it was interrupted). Should I offer to meet up again?  I also thought of just saying straightforward that I like him and ask if anything is possible from his side.

We’re both immigrants in a foreign country and the connection with someone from your homeland that has a lot of similar values with you means a lot. I wanna go further with him, but I don’t know if he’s ready after his divorce, etc. I wonder if this can develop to love, or it’s a forever friend zone.",2,1764099877.0,askanything,8,1.0,False

* Showing seasonal drinks, pastries, and upsells
* Updating prices instantly (no reprinting)
* High-brightness window screens that pull in foot traffic
* A more premium overall look

I’m 24F and graduated last September with a BSc in Geography. I’ve always worked through uni and I’ve been at my current hospitality job for 3 years. I was promoted to supervisor in February. The pay isn’t amazing (£12.50/hr + £50–100/week tronc), but it’s been manageable. It is also a 0-hour contract, some weeks its 5 hours, some weeks I'm on 45.

In April, new management took over and things have gone downhill fast. The new GM is incompetent, brought in all his mates, and has openly said he wants to get rid of the “old annoying staff.” He even hinted to a new hire that he’d promote him to replace me. The place has become extremely cliquey and hostile. They nitpick everything I do, even tiny things like how I prep garnishes. I think it's to try to make me leave... I’ve repeatedly overheard them talking badly about me behind my back, and when confronted they just deny everything. It’s been wrecking my mental health. I have never been workplace bullied and I have a pretty good backbone, so it feels very... Uncomfortable for me. They also just challenge my authority a lot...

This job isn’t my career; it was supposed to be a way to save before moving out. But now I’m facing a deadline: my dad is downsizing and I need to move out by April. I won’t have anywhere to store my stuff, and I don’t have a “home base” anymore. My boyfriend lives up North with his mam, so I can’t move my things there.

I’ve been offered another hospitality job: £12.60/hr, less responsibility, more intense work, less tronc, but better training in coffee, food handling etc. Also independent (a whole different pros/cons, I know). I’ve also saved £18k, but I have intense financial anxiety from growing up poor. Rooms in my city are £800–1000, so I can’t afford to stay here long term, and it would feel like flushing money down the drain. I’ve applied to 30 hospitality jobs and only got an offer because I know the owners. I’m also applying for Geography graduate roles starting next September, but it’s not looking great. The job market being a mess is scaring me a lot with leaving this current job.

I feel stuck:

* Do I stay at my current miserable job until April, put my stuff in storage, and maybe travel until a grad role potentially starts?  I take Geography, so going travelling wouldn’t seem too far astray haha!
* Do I move in with my boyfriend for a few months in April, until a graduate job sticks? His family has said it would be okay. 
* Do I take the new job now so I’m mentally happier/healthier and have more time to build skills/qualifications? 
* Or something else? 
I don’t have much of a safety net to be honest, my relationship with my dad is bad and I can’t rely on him financially or emotionally. My only support is friends, my boyfriend, and his family.
Any advice on what path makes the most sense?

I've used this big shed layout on many farms and been quite happy with it, submitting for feedback and flames alike. It's admittedly a bit ""late game"" because I use Deluxe Retaining Soil, but it's still usable with upgraded (iron, gold) watering cans and not Deluxe soil. If you cut a center aisle out of the pots you can use an Iron watering can to do both sides more easily of the coffee plants daily.

81 pots (81 clay, 810 stone, 81 refined quartz)
81 coffee beans (first spring planting usually covers this because I upcycle after killing sprites in the mines and hoard my way up)
81 Deluxe Retaining Soil (405 stone, 243 fiber, 81 clay)
43 kegs (43 Oak Resin, 43 copper bars, 43 iron bars, 1290 wood)

(Pretty sure I can count, but maybe my math is off, I reddit on mobile, yeah yeah)

It's ~4 beans per plant, so it's about a 2:1 ratio of planters to kegs, and so checking it every day basically gives you 40 coffee a day, if you use the chest and only refill brews once a day.

I do also dual-use this shed to co-process my Hops so I grow those in season and drop them in the chest and swap based on what I'm doing, so usually late game I'll kill time between farm chores and coffee rotations, but this makes it super easy to finish the Qi challenge by the time I'm up and running as I keep the coffees that I didn't use for daily espresso for the Fresh burn. 

It's not a cheap investment (35k gold, 850 wood, 300 stone) but it works for me.

Altogether to start from scratch you need to complete the Island Trader on Ginger Island:
50 Cinder Shards (recipe)
35k gold
81 coffee beans 
1515 stone
2095 wood
43 copper bars
43 iron bars
43 resin
243 fiber
81 clay
81 refined quartz 


If you scale all this down to the Shed instead of Big Shed, you can get by with watering can instead of Deluxe Retaining Soil, just adds time. Still useful for getting coffee up and going.

**College life -** College doesnt organize any cultural and tech fest, there are no active clubs just on paper only, no single sports facilitates are available in the college there and even grounds are not in proper condition. Campus is only surrounded by wild weeds and no one maintains the college campus and even sanitation is not proper. There is no city life and the nearest city is 80km far(ajmer).

Only 5-6 teachers and rest are taught by mtech students.
* **No transportation facilities** is provided by the college and not even RSRTC bus stops on the bus stop of the college. The only way to go to nearest city kekri you have to take lift from the locals which are many time drunk and the college is in front of jaipur-ajmer state highway, when you have to come back to college auto wale take 200rs for 5 km.
* **No power backup** not even during exams .
* **Slow wifi** which needs be to reset everytime when there is a power cut in the college, and it doesnt work most of the time. BSNL wifi

Just building the system felt productive.

But by Thursday, I’d fall behind.  
Then the whole thing would fall apart.

I thought I lacked discipline.

I kept skipping ahead.  
Trying to act like the “ideal” version of me instead of the real one.  
And when I failed, I didn’t adjust the plan - I quit.

Things changed when I stopped aiming for perfect  
and started focusing on what I could *do consistently*.

I asked myself:  
*What’s the simplest thing I can do repeatedly to build real momentum?*

So I made a new rule:

* Start each day with the one task I’m least likely to skip
* Keep habits stupid-simple (read one page, write a few lines, walk a bit)
* Attach them to something I already do (like brushing my teeth or making coffee)
* Focus on finishing, not feeling motivated

My calendar stopped lying to me.  
It became proof.

My confidence stopped crashing with my mood.

And for once, I started finishing what I began.

I sit down to do tasks, but if they involve any mental activity (like studying), nothing comes out. My anxiety is significantly dulled, as if I'm running out of energy to be anxious. I suspect having OCD, and during the waves of fatigue, I can't perform rituals and less concerned about them. Sometimes I experience shortness of breath. Only during these periods, I've never had it before. I think irrationally, for example feel immense guilt for skipping class, even when I legitimately felt awful and that was reasonable. When a problem arises, I can only panic, although normally I have rational thinking and good problem-solving skills

The waves last 3 or 4 days, then recur after a week. Initially, my doctor suspected anemia, but my blood work came out fine. I'm currently taking a vitamins, including B vitamins and taurine (during normal periods, it gives me more energy, but during the waves of fatigue, even a double dose doesn't help). The doctor also theorized that I might have had a latent form of COVID, and that it caused long-COVID. I don't drink alcohol, consume very little caffeine, and eat normally. My sleeping schedule isn't perfect, but I try to keep it under control. I'm not sure what to do now, probably will see a neurologist, but I'd like to hear if anyone has experienced anything similar or has any ideas what it could be",2,1764099288.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

*""That little café we went to was perfect. Our secret spot now?""*

The steam from Nathan's shower filled the bathroom as I sat on our bed, staring at the phone as it buzzed incessantly on the nightstand. 

It wasn’t my phone, nor were they my messages.

It was Nathan—my fiancé’s. Truth was: we’d been engaged for almost a year.

And here were these messages.

How funny.

I knew I shouldn’t look. I should give some respect to my fiancé’s privacy.
But the messages just kept flooding in, and every single time a new message arrived it lit up the screen once and I was forced to have a glimpse of its content.

Missed you. Why not reply. Don’t leave me alone. Babe. Blablabla.

I took a deep breath and took the phone anyway.

The messages were all from Chloe. Our neighbor.

*""Hope your girlfriend wouldn’t mind. I mean we didn’t meant to hurt her, right?""*

My hands trembled as I scrolled up all his chat history, finding weeks of exchanges I'd never known existed. 

Flirtatious messages, inside jokes, plans to meet when I was at work. 

One specific line from 2 hours ago made my blood run cold:

*""She's so naive, isn't she? Poor little small-town girl has no idea what's happening right under her nose.""*

Nathan's response: *""Let's keep it that way for now.""*

The phone slipped from my numb fingers, clattering onto the hardwood floor. The shower was still running. He had no idea I'd seen everything.

When Nathan emerged twenty minutes later, towel wrapped around his waist, hair still dripping, I was sitting exactly where he'd left me. But everything had changed.

""Hey, babe."" He smiled that easy, familiar smile that had charmed me for nine years. ""You look pale. Everything okay?""

I held up his phone. ""We need to talk.""

His face went through a series of micro-expressions—surprise, panic, then something that looked almost like relief. ""Emily, I can explain—""

""Explain what, exactly?"" My voice came out steadier than I felt. ""Explain how you've been meeting Chloe behind my back for weeks? Explain how she calls me naive and you agree? Explain how you have a secret spot together?""

Nathan sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, suddenly looking older than his twenty-seven years. ""It's not what it looks like.""

""Then what is it, Nathan? Because it looks like you're having an affair with our neighbor.""

""It's not an affair!"" He ran his hands through his wet hair, droplets scattering. ""Chloe's going through a rough time. Her ex left her with massive debt, she's struggling to make rent—she needed someone to talk to.""

""And that someone had to be my fiancé?""

""She doesn't have anyone else, Em. She's alone in this city, just like we were when we first moved here. I was just being a good neighbor.""

I stared at him, searching his face for the man I'd loved since I was eighteen. ""Good neighbors don't have secret meeting spots, Nathan. Good neighbors don't call their friend's girlfriend naive behind her back.""

""You're being paranoid."" His voice took on that dismissive tone I'd been hearing more and more lately. ""This is exactly what Chloe said would happen—that you'd get jealous and insecure if you found out I was helping her.""

""She predicted this?"" The words came out as a whisper. ""You two discussed how I'd react?""

""Emily, you're spiraling. This is your insecurity talking, not logic."" He reached for my hands, but I pulled them away. ""Chloe is going through hell right now. She needs support, and I'm not going to abandon someone who needs help just because my girlfriend can't handle me having a female friend.""

The casual cruelty of it hit me like a slap. ""A female friend who calls me naive? Who talks about what a good actor you are? Who says poor little small-town girl?""

Nathan's jaw tightened. ""You went through my entire conversation history?""

""That's what you're focusing on? My invasion of privacy, not your emotional affair?""

""It's not an affair!"" He stood up abruptly, the towel nearly slipping. ""God, Emily, this is exactly why I didn't tell you about helping her. I knew you'd blow it out of proportion.""

""Blow it out of proportion?"" I felt something dangerous rising in my chest—a fury I'd never allowed myself to feel before. ""Nathan, you've been lying to me for weeks. Meeting another woman in secret. Sharing intimate conversations. Making plans behind my back. What part of that is proportional?""

""She needed someone to talk to about her problems—""

""Then why didn't you tell me? Why all the secrecy if it was so innocent?""

He was quiet for a long moment, and in that silence, I heard everything he wasn't saying.

""Because you knew it wasn't innocent,"" I said softly. ""You knew exactly what you were doing.""

""Emily—""

""We're getting married in a month, Nathan. One month. And you're having secret coffee dates with another woman, letting her call me naive, agreeing that I'm some clueless small-town girl who doesn't know what's happening in her own relationship.""

He sat back down, suddenly looking defeated. ""It's complicated.""

""No, it's not."" I stood up, surprised by how steady my legs felt. ""It's actually very simple. Either you want to marry me, or you don't. Either you respect me, or you don't. Either you're committed to this relationship, or you're not.""

""Of course I want to marry you. Em, you're everything to me—""

""Then prove it."" The words came out harder than I intended. ""Cut contact with Chloe. Completely. No more secret meetings, no more being her emotional support system, no more anything.""

Nathan's face changed. Something stubborn and defensive flickered in his eyes. ""I can't just abandon her when she needs help.""

""But you can abandon me?""

""That's not what I'm doing.""

""Isn't it?"" I grabbed his phone again, scrolling to find the message that had hurt most. ""Here. 'Let's keep it that way for now.' Keep what that way, Nathan? Keep me in the dark? Keep me looking like a fool?""

His phone buzzed in my hand. Another message from Chloe: *""Can't sleep. Thinking about our conversation today. You always know exactly what to say to make me feel better.""*

I held the screen toward him. ""Still think this is just friendship?""

Nathan looked at the message, then at me, and I saw something I'd never seen before in his eyes—not guilt, not remorse, but irritation. As if I was the problem. As if I was the one being unreasonable.

""Emily, you're making this into something it's not. Chloe is vulnerable right now, and I'm not going to kick her when she's down just because you can't handle me having compassion for someone else.""

The words hung in the air between us like a challenge. And for the first time in nine years, I wondered if the man I was supposed to marry in thirty-two days was someone I even knew at all.",2,1764099263.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

I'm in Stockholm a few times a year, visiting my girlfriend, and during the week i work from different places. I would prefer a friendly co-working space, but given my situation (freelance, just for a few weeks at a time, generally very pricey) it's not a good option for me. So instead i work from café's such as Bröd & Salt or Dieselverkstaden (in Sickla).

I am interested in finding similar places in around the city center, as well as meeting fellow remote workers. I think it can be a nice way of meeting new people. We could meet at a place, work and have a chat over a cup of coffee.

I'll share a bit about myself. I'm Bas (33M), born and raised in the Netherlands. Currently my home base is in Rotterdam, but 3 or 4 times a year i'm in Stockholm. I am trained as an architect and currently work as a technical draftsman for various building companies. I guess i'm somewhat of the architect/engineering type, but i'm equally interested in music, film, art, philosophy, society, popular/internet culture. In all of these cases i like it when it is a bit niche/nerdy, independent, controversial. Do with that what you want, ha.

Stated the main reason was my wife (39F) was emotionally abuseive (i never noticed it but anything is possible) could use advise or insight if anyone else has had a similar issue.,"Good afternoon all My (39M) daughter(18F) Moved out and married her girlfriend of two years. As much as i dreaded the time coming I knew it would happen. We had no notice just randomly at 1000 on a saturday her girlfriend now wife showed up with a truck. Now me and my daughter have always been close since I first held her at 2 months old after returing from iraq. We have a good father daughteer relationship and i would venture to say even a friendship. Infact when she decided to come out it, she only came out to my wife (39F) because ""dad has known since i was like 10""

Now the problem. I always thought my wife and daughter had a good relationship, they had their rocky points as all do, but they were constant shopping, concert, and walking partners so it is not like they avoided each other. When my daughter moved out she straight up told my wife that she is the reason she was leaving. She said my wife didn't validate or support her and down played her medical issues.

On the flip side my daughter would talk to me about anything, even if i didnt agree with it because i could be impartial and supportive. Even if i didn't like a choice i would always say ""at the end of the day i cant make all your choices for you, but i will support you"" Purely because its how i was tought to talk about that stuff from my therepist post deployment.

My kid is my everything, literally the only reason i am still here. she got me through my darkest times as i did her as well. she made me a better man and allowed me to seek help because when a burger place she wanted to go to for her birthday was super crowded she just looked at me and said ""its ok dad, i know there are to many people we can go somewhere else"". But its killing me that in 18 years this is the only thing i have no idea how to fix for them. I can't talk to my daughter about it because its not fair to her for me to put any of this on her, and i can't talk to my wife about it because my daughter is 100% no contact with her because i feel like an a$$ if i do since my daughter still talks to me. I guess this is more a venting post because i don't know if any advise can actually be had but i would appreciate any input because i am truly broken over this. Hell it took me two weeks to be able to buy a coffee because going out for coffee was ""our thing"" I suspect its my PTSD making my brain view this as hard as i am and i just don't know what to do.

Started with lectures immediately after waking up. Got through a module and a half before needing to switch gears. 

**Afternoon:**

Headed to the cafe. Did business tasks first then dove into russian anki decks. Day 88 complete. The cafe lighting was terrible today but the coffee made up for it. Spent roughly 2 hours here bouncing between business obligations and flashcards.

**Night:**

Set up my desk with the timer visible because I wanted to track exactly how long I was in flow state. Did reading, more russian practice, and livestreamed the entire session.

Livestreaming is as a pain to set up but I just purchased items to optimize this. I hate wasting time. Had a total of 3 viewers lmao. Spent 2 hours on this.

1p6lumc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LangfordBC/comments/1p6lumc/meadowcure_pharmacy_coffee/,Meadowcure Pharmacy + Coffee,"Hi everyone, apologies for a shameless local business post ahead of time.

  
I recently opened a pharmacy and coffee shop in Langford right next to the Y and Ramen Arashi (amazing ramen btw) called Meadowcure Pharmacy + Coffee. Besides the obvious of being a pharmacy and a coffee shop (no obligation to use both), we also have arcade games (free of charge) and a local nail artist who takes bookings for gel-x overlay work. 

Please check us out whether it is just for the coffee shop (our matcha is amazing but I'm extremely biased and drink that daily lol). We also work with local businesses such as Saltspring Soapworks, House of Boateng, Hornby Organic, Chorus Supernatural, + more and looking to add to our local business selection. Our prices are very competitive and often can be lower than the direct vendor due to the 5% discount for local residents of Westhills/surrounding area, students and seniors.

Please feel free to call, email, or dm for any questions or info or if you have a local business/product suggestion you'd like to promote. 

Bonus: Our hours are expanding starting Jan 2, 2026 to Mon-Fri 8am-5:30pm and Sat 10am-2pm to be more inclusive of more work schedules. If you'd like to make use of the expanded hours prior to Jan 2, please reach out to me and I can accommodate. 

  
Thank you for checking us out and sorry for such a long post (assuming you made it this far lol).",3,1764098796.0,LangfordBC,1,1.0,False

Junaid Khan holds the manifest. Thermal paper. Block letters. His fingerprints are burning into evidence.

No NASA part numbers. A shopping list you could fill at Home Depot if you lie about the permit.

He reads it once. Memorizes it. Then he erases himself.

The butane lighter clicks. The flame catches the corner. He doesn’t drop it into the coffee can—he holds it. Watches the fire crawl toward his thumb. The paper curls. Blackens. The heat touches his skin. He doesn’t flinch.

The ash collapses. Carbon particulate. No chain of custody. No evidence.

No Junaid Khan. Just a man with a burn blister and a balloon.

Ambient: 12°C. Steel walls. Mid-November. Three in the morning. No insulation. A rented parcel of dust in the Sierra de la Giganta, hammered by the crosswinds locals call *El Norte*.

He stands in the blue wash of the server rack LEDs. Sleeveless hoodie. Breath visible. Core temp: 36.8°C. No thermogenic response. The trailer’s aluminum skin conducts cold like a morgue drawer.

He checks the Medtronic insulin pump clipped to his belt. **Battery: 82%. Reservoir: 140 units. Temp: 12°C.** Cold chain intact.

The pump keeps him alive. The pump doesn’t care about federal watchlists.

# THE OXYGEN PROBLEM

The Raspberry Pi sits on an overturned milk crate. Green power LED blinking. A $15 logic core running a PID loop on the climate.

Junaid checks the thermal readout. Core temp: 41.8°C. Stable.

The prototype tank is the problem. The SO₂ stays liquid down to -75°C, but the cheap brass valve lubricant turns to glue at altitude. At 20 kilometers up, O-rings harden. Grease becomes cement. The valve seizes.

NASA solves this with radioisotope heater units. Junaid has forty dollars and a dead cousin.

He looks at the chemical hand warmers on the desk. Iron powder. Oxidation.

Useless in the sky.

At 20km, the partial pressure of O₂ drops to near vacuum. The reaction rate craters. A warmer meant to last ten hours dies in six minutes. He tested it last week. The data log was a flatline.

He thinks about Aref. Twenty-two years old. Healthy. Dead because the air wouldn’t let his sweat dry.

The valve has to work. The math has to work. For him.

He flips open a green plastic crate. Inside: a 600-watt solar inverter. Generic Chinese casing. He rips the plastic off, exposing the aluminum heat sinks.

He plugs it in. Sends a diagnostic current through it. The fins warm up. Waste heat.

He grabs a roll of Kapton tape. Polyimide film. Rated to -269°C. He tapes the inverter’s heat sink directly to the neck of the payload valve.

The inverter hums. The valve temperature climbs ten degrees over ambient.

Aref would have called this insane. Aref would have been right.

But Aref is dead, and the physics doesn’t care about sanity. It cares about the dew point. So does Junaid.

# //--------------- [ PSI CRITICAL: VENTING ] --------------//

# TRANSFER PROTOCOL

He connects the 2kg prototype tank to the donor cylinder.

*Hiss.*

Thin at first, then thickening into a hard, steady turbulence.

SO₂ concentration rising. Dry, metallic. The smell of burnt matches and copper pennies dissolving on the tongue. It matches the reference profile.

Junaid checks the sensor on his belt. Reading: 7 ppm. Exposure limit is 5 ppm. The trailer vents are open. Survivable.

He watches the pressure gauge. 40 psi. 60.

Outside, *El Norte* slams against the aluminum siding. The wind noise masks the compressor whine.

He adjusts the regulator.

*Click.*

Steady.

Then the pitch changes. A high whine. Thermodynamic.

The valve freezes.

Joule-Thomson effect. Rapid expansion cools the metal. Condensation flashes into ice. The hinge catches.

Pressure spikes.

The gauge jumps. 95 psi. 120. The Teflon lines vibrate like guitar strings tuned to a frequency called catastrophe.

He reaches for the wrench. Not there.

He moves a box cutter. An SD card case.

No wrench.

The hiss becomes a scream. 160 psi. Failure modes cascade through his mind: valve rupture, fragmentation, fatal hemorrhage. A coroner’s report that reads *industrial accident* instead of *climate intervention*.

He grabs the coupling with his bare left hand.

The cold is not cold. The cold is violence.

Contact temp: -50°C. The brass bonds to his skin. He feels the epidermis freeze to the metal—a wet sound, like tape peeling off glass. The liquid SO₂ boils against the fitting. The phase change pulls 548 kJ/kg straight out of the dermis. Pain receptors fire in a single unified scream, then go silent. Thermal shutdown. The nerves are too damaged to complain.

He smells it before he sees it. The smell of frozen meat. His own flesh.

He doesn’t let go.

*For Aref.*

Grip pressure nominal.

*Turn.*

High-frequency friction. 8kHz. Metal on metal. The scream in his throat stays locked behind his teeth. He will not give the desert the satisfaction.

*Turn.*

The scream cuts off.

Pressure drops. 90 psi... 70... Stable.

He releases the coupling. His hand peels away from the brass with a sound like Velcro. Skin stays behind. A perfect oval of dermis frozen to the fitting like a stamp.

Left hand: tallow white. The color of candle wax. Capillary refill time: >3 seconds. Frostbite, Grade 2. He flexes the fingers. Delayed tendon response. Motor function preserved.

Gauze. Tape. Pressure dressing applied with one hand and his teeth.

Compressor cycles off. Ambient noise drops to 42 dB.

Junaid sits on the folding chair. He glances at the secondary monitor. Not the flight telemetry. The weather feed.

# CURRENT CONDITIONS: SYLHET, BANGLADESH.

*Humidity: 85%.*

# THE GHOST

His phone buzzes on the desk.

The sound is wrong. Not the soft pulse of a text. Not the rhythm of a calendar notification. This is the hard, insistent vibration of an incoming call. Someone wants him to answer.

Heart rate: 102 BPM. Climbing.

He flips it over. **UNKNOWN NUMBER.** U.S. Country Code.

He stares at the screen. The green “Accept” button pulses. The red “Decline” button waits.

Fifty kilograms of sulfur dioxide. Industrial quantity. Purchased through a shell corporation with a stolen EIN. That purchase triggered a Suspicious Activity Report. He knows this because he designed it to. He wanted the chemicals. The SAR was the cost.

But now the cost is calling him.

The phone keeps buzzing. Fourth ring. Fifth.

He imagines the other end. A desk. A monitor. A man in a polyester suit who has never been too hot in his life, cross-referencing purchase orders with TSA travel logs. Khan, Junaid. One-way ticket to Cabo. No return booking. Chemical precursors. No legitimate business purpose.

The profile writes itself: Military-age male. Bangladeshi descent. Off-grid. Buying bomb-grade materials via Hawala.

He knows what they see. He knows what they’ll never see.

Seventh ring.

His hand moves. Not to answer. To survive.

The Faraday bag is under the desk. Matte silver polymer. He snatches the phone with his damaged hand… the gauze catches on the edge, pulls, and he feels the wound tear slightly… and shoves it into the bag. Rolls the top down. Seals the electromagnetic cage.

The buzzing dies.

Heart rate: 118 BPM. Still climbing.

He looks at the silver bag. The silence inside it. The silence that will not last.

They know where he was. The cell tower pinged. The GPS logged. The triangulation is already running. Even with the phone in the bag, the last known position isn’t just a coordinate. It’s a crosshair.

He has hours. Maybe less.

He looks back at the Pi terminal. The green cursor blinks. Steady. Indifferent.

Ping time: 340ms. Normal: 80ms. Packet loss: 6%.

The cursor jumps.

Unauthorized packet count rising.

**AUTH: A\_SONG**Kernel v19 detected. Thermal shutdown initiated.

Andrew.

Co-founder. Ex-partner. The only other person who understands the code.

He’s tunneling through the Starlink uplink. He has the encryption keys.

The cursor blinks.

# EXECUTING: THERMAL_SHUTDOWN.PY

Junaid reaches for the wire cutters on the table. Red handles. He types with his right hand. The left throbs now… delayed pain response. Fingertips clumsy. He misses the ‘Enter’ key twice.

He clamps the cutters over the Starlink cable running to the Power-Over-Ethernet injector.

The terminal types one last line.

# MESSAGE: You always go physical, Junaid.

*Snap.*

The white light on the router dies. The fan spins down.

On the screen, the cursor freezes mid-blink. The session is severed.

The FBI is calling. Andrew is hacking. The valve froze and took his skin with it.

And in Sylhet, the wet bulb is six degrees from cooking his family alive.

He looks at the balloon. The tank. The Pi.

“Offline,” he says. His voice is raw. Steady. “Launch in ten.”

How do you hide a 1.5-meter latex balloon from a pulse-Doppler airport surveillance radar? You don’t hide the object. You hide the velocity.

Junaid executes the “Zero-Doppler Notch” maneuver. But invisible is not the same as undetected.

Someone else is watching the sky.

Todays structure was solid. Morning to night grind with the usual chaos mixed in.

Started with lectures immediately after waking up. Got through a module and a half before needing to switch gears. 

**Afternoon:**

Headed to the cafe. Did business tasks first then dove into russian anki decks. Day 88 complete. The cafe lighting was terrible today but the coffee made up for it. Spent roughly 2 hours here bouncing between business obligations and flashcards.

**Night:**

Set up my desk with the timer visible because I wanted to track exactly how long I was in flow state. Did reading, more russian practice, and livestreamed the entire session.

Livestreaming is as a pain to set up but I just purchased items to optimize this. I hate wasting time. Had a total of 3 viewers lmao. Spent 2 hours on this.

Looking for some insight.","Good afternoon all My (39M) daughter(18F) Moved out and married her girlfriend of two years. As much as i dreaded the time coming I knew it would happen. We had no notice just randomly at 1000 on a saturday her girlfriend now wife showed up with a truck. Now me and my daughter have always been close since I first held her at 2 months old after returing from iraq. We have a good father daughteer relationship and i would venture to say even a friendship. Infact when she decided to come out it, she only came out to my wife (39F) because ""dad has known since i was like 10""

Now the problem. I always thought my wife and daughter had a good relationship, they had their rocky points as all do, but they were constant shopping, concert, and walking partners so it is not like they avoided each other. When my daughter moved out she straight up told my wife that she is the reason she was leaving. She said my wife didn't validate or support her and down played her medical issues.

On the flip side my daughter would talk to me about anything, even if i didnt agree with it because i could be impartial and supportive. Even if i didn't like a choice i would always say ""at the end of the day i cant make all your choices for you, but i will support you"" Purely because its how i was tought to talk about that stuff from my therepist post deployment.

My kid is my everything, literally the only reason i am still here. she got me through my darkest times as i did her as well. she made me a better man and allowed me to seek help because when a burger place she wanted to go to for her birthday was super crowded she just looked at me and said ""its ok dad, i know there are to many people we can go somewhere else"". But its killing me that in 18 years this is the only thing i have no idea how to fix for them. I can't talk to my daughter about it because its not fair to her for me to put any of this on her, and i can't talk to my wife about it because my daughter is 100% no contact with her because i feel like an a$$ if i do since my daughter still talks to me. I guess this is more a venting post because i don't know if any advise can actually be had but i would appreciate any input because i am truly broken over this. Hell it took me two weeks to be able to buy a coffee because going out for coffee was ""our thing"" I suspect its my PTSD making my brain view this as hard as i am and i just don't know what to do.

The Magic’s last 5 straight games have seen more than 228 points, while the 76ers have seen totals over 230 in their last 3 outings. At the moment, both offenses are putting up more than enough points to justify a high-scoring affair. Paolo Banchero’s absence hasn’t kept Orlando from being an offensive juggernaut, and Tyrese Maxey while listed as ‘Questionable’ is expected to play for Philly this evening.

Grand Tactician Civil War

7th  December 1861. 


Jefferson Davis, a newly elected President of CSA, was having a High Priority Conference with BG Thomas „Stonewall“ Jackson in Winchester, Shenandoah Valley, Virginia....

„General, we were thinking that we would have a nice, peaceful winter but Federals have other plans...
First in the West they have come dangerously close to Ft. Smith so we had to attack them and defeated them at Ft. Coffee with our Army of the West.
Few days ago, General Lee won a tremendeous victory at Manassas Junction where his Army of Potomac with Army of Northern Virginia defeated 4 Union Corps....
It was a bloodbath.... More than 12000 Union casualties but also very heavy losses on our side as well, more than 6000.
But, victory is a victory...
And right now we have numerical superiority on Union 220k vs 180k.
They had 202k but lost heavily in those two battles and now have 180000 soldiers in the field.
Still a powerful US Army and war is not over, they will grow in size...
After making Conscription Act and one month after that we started using drafts as reinforcements for our Armies and now we are waiting for Volunteers pool to replenish – if we want to make new units – but we will not recruit any new units till February 1862....
We are thinking to create few Cavarly Corps, a fast moving, small units for capturing distant cities and some raid....
They could draw Union forces away from frontlines and allow us some room for maneuver....
General Jackson, your Army was designed to have one big Cavarly Division, that is almost 10000 Cavarly man, 4 brigades, use it well to smash the flank of Union forces that will attack you here at Winchester ...
I know that some of them are still armed with obsolete weapons but we are working on making some good cavarly medium range carbines, but it will take time to produce, and Richmond Carbine is also coming from production factories, but in small batches as we ordered 10000 of them....
We have been working hard on economy that will sustain this – very costly war.
We have made some mills, and other economy projects, we have introduced Tarrifs and that brought already income of 70 million $.
We will have to work on our Credit Rating which is BBB+.
We have now 4 prisons and still some are overcrowded....
We had to made Fort at Fredericksburg, and Supply Depots at Manasas Junction (Federals burnt previous one there).
We also made supply Depot in Tenessese south of Cairo, IL.
Union is making attacks there so that’s why our Army is there to defend and in the Spring of 1862. this wil be a staging area for attack on Cairo, IL.
We have captured many rifles, mostly muskets and guns from the Federals but we still need more so we will work on Diplomacy to obtain reliable Austrian made, Lorenz rifles muskets.
We are working to make real Corps Organization and to have Three Armies and maybe even Four for most important Theatres of War.
We also plan to made some horse artillery, that will allow us some fast, mobile firepower on the battlefield.
We also plan to start to produce some Rifled Cannons, Parrots, Wiards and maybe in the future to import some good pieces from British.
We need some artillery with better range and damage for counterbattery and control of the battlefield....
Your Army of Shennandoah and General Lee Army of Potomac were purposely made stronger – to withstand attacks of at least 2 Union Corps....
General, in next battle you will be outnumbered but not very much maybe 10000 or less soldiers and there is two Union Corps against only your one Army. Initally you will have slight advantage against Union 37th Army of cca. 37k soldiers....
If you manage to rout that Corps that maybe other Union Corps of 17k will just retreat...
Anyway, whatever the cost, Winchester must be held, at all cost tooth and nail! Dig in, dig in and prepare for battle!""



Account of Battle of Ft. Coffee, Indian Territory...

Union General Jacob D. Cox Jr, with 25982 Infantry, 388 Cavarly, 16 Guns against General Albert S. Johnston, Army of the West with 35647 Infantry, 2428 Cavarly, 51 Guns.
In the Western Theathre, after our victories in the East in October there was not much on the front happening. Army of the West was training at Ft. Smith and preparing to go into Winter Quaters but suddenly Union Army was on the move and advanced towards Ft. Coffee. We waited them few days for them to attack but they stopped at Ft. Coffee... Hmmm, no wonder as in this part – locally our Army of The West outnumbered them by good margin....
So, in spite of late season – we have decided to attack them, make them good losses and then retreat back to Ft. Smith.
It worked as a charm but we had substantial losses  as Union commander  was clever as a fox...
We had to attack from the south direction, Federal were guarding two Objective Points in the North.
We brought artillery forward and started with maneuvers to envelop Unions Left Flank with two divisions.
That plan worked but we had some losses because Federals at first defended objective points furiously but later in the battle they started to pull towards their Right Flank.

Our Centre was weak and at one point they charged and routed one of our artyllery batteries with James guns so we lost there 16 guns.
We stabilized situation in the centre and launched enveloping attacks on their Right Flank. In the process we captured Union Entry Point – that maybe triggered Union attack of our enveloping Division and a Half of Forces. We basically had there to endure attack of Unions 2 later 3 divisions and our second division there had only one rifle brigade and cavarly brigade. That cavarly brigade later in the battle routed but we managed to defend there – with big losses – until rest of our forces broke their Left Flank, captured both Objective Points and managed to help attacked forces on Unions Right Flank and rout the enemy from the battlefield. Major Victory 

Losses:

Union: 8055 Infantry, 173 Cavarly, 20 of 20 Guns.
8430 Total

CSA Losses: 3191 Infantry, 635 Cavarly, 16 Guns
4064 Total

Captured 2978 enemy soldiers, 5594 rifles, 7 guns



Account of Battle of Manassas Junction December 5th 1861.

58045 Union soldiers in 4 Corps vs Army of Potomac commanded by general Lee (cca 47k), with Army of Northern Virginia coming as reinforcements (cca 23k).

70565 CSA forces together but it was mainly Lee Army battle in the beginning.

Not long after Battle at Ft. Coffee in Western Theathre, troops in Virginia have gone to Winter Quaters....
Troops were thinking that – Union forces will not attack during the Winter 1861/1862. but they had other plans obviously....
We had 2 Armies defending at Bull Run. Army of Nothern Virginia arrived as reinforcement but really only took part on the second day of the battle.
So, first part of the battle General Lee Army of the Potomac had to endure attack by no less than two US Army Corps.
We were defending behind rivers, diging breastworks all day waiting for the Federal attack from the North.
This time we anchored our Right Flank and extended it briefly with our skirmishers. Skirmishers, from the cover of the woods routed one Union cavarly unit and made Federals deploy for a battle and lose few hours there. Then we withdrew the skirmishers. Union attack was violent in the centre but we managed to withstand it. We deployed Skirmishers aroud Objective Point but later allowed Union forces to capture it.
This allowed our Army of Northern Virginia and Lee’s right flank to completely later envelop Union forces that crossed the creek around Objective Point. We routed 2 Union Corps and mauled the 2 other. Last Union corps that was attacking our Right Flank we allowed to escape as the battle have already taken big toll, more than 6000 on our side and more than 12000 on Union side...
The next battle will be soon at Winchester as Union forces attacked simultaneously at two places.
Detailed losses report.... Blacburn ford was full of yankee  bodies...

12102 Infantry, 421 Cavarly, 37 Guns.
12828 Total losses.

 My current electric kettle cools down ridiculously fast. I’ll boil water, get distracted for literally ten minutes, and by the time I come back it’s already lukewarm.  


 I end up reboiling it multiple times a day, which is driving me nuts and probably isn’t great for the electric bill either.

I’m not looking for anything super fancy or smart-home connected.   
  
I just want a kettle that can actually hold its heat for a while, whether that means it has good insulation, a double wall, or some kind of keep-warm function that doesn’t taste weird or overheat the water.  
  
 I work from home and tend to sip tea all day, so having something that stays warm without constant reheating would make my life noticeably easier.

1p6lgl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyMotives/comments/1p6lgl9/how_to_manage_stress/,How to manage stress,"The symptoms of acute and chronic stress can make daily life difficult, particularly when you need to study intensively for professional qualifications. Uncontrolled stress can impact on your general health far beyond the immediate future, putting you at risk of a catalogue of health problems. 

Everyone occasionally suffers a certain amount of acute stress, but learning how to successfully manage recurring or chronic anxiety is vital. Controlling stress helps you meet the challenges ahead with determination and enthusiasm.

Here are a few ways to manage stress with some lifestyle changes and simple swaps.

# 1. Planning your studies

CFA candidates need to meet the minimum entry requirements to enrol for CFA Level 1. The majority of applicants study during their spare time following a full day’s work, which leaves very little room for a life beyond work and study. 

It is a challenging situation, but students persevere regardless for the reward of gaining one of the most influential qualifications in finance.

However, by being efficiently organized, it should be possible to limit the stressful effects of struggling to complete assignments. Anxiety usually increases when the situation appears to be out of control.

Making a detailed study plan when following a course is always beneficial in the fight against stress. It helps break down an overwhelming amount of essays, facts and sub topics into manageable portions. However, research conducted by Professor Alejandro Lleras of the University of Illinois outlines the benefits of taking regular breaks while studying.

The professor’s concentration experiment revealed that some students took a short break of around 5 minutes every hour. As the day wore on, they retained more information and enthusiasm for their task than those who continually studied without pausing at all. 

The explanation was that over a relatively short time, the brain gradually becomes unresponsive to what it is dealing with. Taking regular breaks helps beat the stress produced by ineffective studying by giving the brain a chance to relax. 

Factoring in short breaks of up to 15 minutes for every two hours of study should help keep your concentration levels maintain their sharpness.



# 2. Nutrition

The brain requires twice as much fuel to function correctly as any other part of the body. Missing meals and feeling hungry can be stressful in itself and eventually lead to feeling unwell. Hunger also has a negative effect on concentration particularly while studying. 

However, simply filling up with junk food won’t provide the essential nutrients you need to combat the stress of intense studying within a restricted work schedule. A key solution to halting the effects of anxiety is to eat foods that are effective against stress. Ideally they should contain vitamin B compounds such as niacin, riboflavin and thiamin.

You’ll find them in green leafy vegetables, fruit, dairy produce and yeast extract. Omega-3 in oily fish and Brussels sprouts helps improve concentration and memory retention. 

Anyone who studies while following vegan principles needs to be particularly mindful of eating healthy foods containing a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Haphazard, rushed mealtimes usually contribute to indigestion, which as outlined above can cause serious long-term health problems. 

When studying late at night, it’s important to eat foods that are easy to digest. Some of the most suitable include bananas, rice and scrambled eggs.

An unfortunate side effect of stress incurred through studying far into the night is a craving for sweet foods and coffee to keep you awake. However, these are the two most perilous foods to consume in this situation. 

Excess sugar provides a fast rush of glucose into the bloodstream providing a temporary surge of energy. The level drops just as quickly leaving you feeling more lethargic than before. Opt instead for fruit containing natural glucose that releases at a slower rate. 

Coffee generally has up to 90 milligrams of caffeine per cup. Like sugar, it’s an addictive substance that can distract you from your studies. Even more detrimental is the effect caffeine may have on health as it can raise blood pressure, increase headaches and encourage irritability. Even worse, it can prevent you from enjoying a good night’s sleep, an essential requirement of successful studying.

# 3. Exercise

Regular exercise can be one of the most effective methods of relieving stress at any time. Physical activity increases the rate of blood flow, resulting in more oxygen being transported around the body by the red blood cells. 

As the blood moves through the inner depths of the brain, it stimulates your grey matter to release a cocktail of hormones, including endorphins and serotonin. These two hormones are famous for producing feelings of pleasure and contentment. They are acknowledged as decisive antidotes to stress, depression and mental health.

Exercise falls into two main categories; aerobic and anaerobic. The former describes a fairly strenuous activity such as walking, jogging and swimming that makes you feel slightly out of breath. Aerobic exercise helps improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system that consists of the heart and blood vessels. 

Anaerobic exercise refers to activities that the body cannot complete with oxygen intake alone, such as High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). It includes lifting weights and practising yoga. Many people indulge in anaerobic exercises to improve their general fitness, build muscle tone and increase stamina.

When organizing your study schedule, it’s important to include time for at least 150 minutes of exercise distributed throughout the week. Whichever form of exercise you choose, it has been shown to be a great way to manage stress and anxiety. 

Exercise also often brings opportunities for socialising and making new friends at a local gym, parkrun or sports club which is another important factor in alleviating stress. Alternatively, activities such as yoga can be practised in privacy at home, while if running is your thing it may be worth investing in a treadmill that can be used when poor weather prevents you from going out. 

When you exercise as part of your studying routine, the beneficial effects include increased oxygen, which sharpens your concentration while relieving stress and helping you to relax. Exercise can also make you feel physically tired, a healthy part of being able to fall asleep quickly. It should help contribute towards feeling refreshed and ready for the challenges of a new day of work and study.

# 4. Restful sleep

An important factor in stress management is making sure you have enough sleep. Adults who sleep for around 8 hours each night have been shown to feel relatively relaxed and in control of their daily lives, while a lack of sleep can lead to a range of consequences including a negative impact on mood and anxiety.

Being disorganized often leads to studying until the early hours. This deprives you of vital sleep, which can impact on how alert you may be the following day. Without sufficient sleep for the body’s systems to realign themselves, they place themselves in a state of distress. This encourages the brain to compensate by releasing additional cortisol to supply emergency energy in the form of glucose. In some instances, too much cortisol may even contribute to unexpected weight gain.

Sleep deprivation or insomnia can interfere with the immune system by not providing it with enough time to strengthen itself. A nutritious diet of vitamin C enriched fruit and vegetables helps alleviate the problem. 

This is important, because when the immune system isn’t operating as efficiently as it should, you can fall prey to common colds, bacterial infections and genetic conditions such as skin problems. Feeling unwell means you might not be inclined to study or stick to your study plan, which in turn can make you feel even more stressed because you feel like you’re not making enough progress.

However, a frequent complaint of stress-related sleep deprivation is problems with eyesight such as eyestrain. One sign of not having enough sleep is a condition called myokymia. It causes the muscles in the eyelids to twitch in uncontrollable spasms. It can be averted by having at least six undisturbed hours of sleep every night.

To encourage a restful sleep, invest in a comfortable mattress topper, cosy brushed cotton sheets and a supportive pillow. Maintain an ambient temperature that’s relatively cool and line curtains to ensure street lamps can’t disturb your rest. 

Avoid caffeine for at least six hours before going to bed, and most importantly, banish all electronic gadgets from the bedroom. Finally, maintain a regular sleep time that’s sympathetic to your study schedule and your internal circadian rhythm.

# 5. Time for relaxation

When studying for a professional qualification, the regime of learning obviously has to be strict to reach the recommended targets on time. However, by creating a practical schedule for daily study, the pace can be more sensibly measured. 

It’s important to incorporate regular breaks that include high-quality relaxation. Although individual temperaments and energy levels influence the amount of time spent away from studies, everyone benefits from an occasional extended break.

Significant time away from studying is a release from a source of stress. An evening spent on a favourite pastime such as listening to music or going out to dinner may seem like time wasted, but research shows it’s actually well spent. Relaxation provides the brain and nervous system with valuable time to recuperate leading to renewed enthusiasm for further studying.

Research carried out by Exeter University revealed the importance of spending time in nature for relieving stress, as part of maintaining good overall health and wellbeing. The stress levels of 20,000 people were analyzed before and after they spent just two hours each week amongst natural surroundings such as woodlands or a local park. The research concluded that people felt more relaxed and psychologically happier every time a green space was visited. 

Incorporate nature into a study area by following biophilia, the science of integrating nature with daily life. If you don’t have time to spend a couple of hours in nature each week then there are other things you can do to bring nature closer to you. Even a few houseplants around your desk can lift your mood.

# 6. Mindfulness meditation

Stress of some sort has been experienced by people since time began. Coincidentally, the relaxation technique of meditation, so often associated with religion, developed thousands of years ago, undoubtedly to combat the stresses of everyday life. 

Today, mindfulness meditation has become one of the most popular methods of counteracting anxiety, particularly amongst students, and has been shown to have a mild to moderate positive impact on the effects of issues such as stress and anxiety.

It’s incredibly easy to do and can take as little or as much time as you can spare. It involves sitting comfortably before concentrating on your breathing, making it steady, deep and unhurried.

Then you simply force yourself to be aware of your surroundings in the present moment while blocking out all thoughts of the past and future. Even a few minutes should be enough to introduce some calm into a busy schedule of study and release the tension of accumulated stress.

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) has confidence in the value of mindfulness meditation and offers it as a therapy to help combat depression. Dr Julieta Galant of Cambridge University recently conducted research into the effectiveness of this method. More than 11,000 people up to the age of 73 took part in reporting the effects of practising the technique. 

# Don’t underestimate the importance of stress management

Studying can easily incur stress that has the potential to spiral out of control.

Symptoms such as fatigue and indigestion are early signs of stress caused through an imbalance of adrenaline and other elements within the body. If allowed to continue, they can eventually lead to serious health complaints. 

Taking positive measures such as compiling a study plan, healthy eating and enjoying restful sleep, contribute to significantly reducing stress levels.

The causes, symptoms and remedies of stress are interconnected amongst themselves and with the body’s complex systems. Successful stress management is therefore more effective when it incorporates as many methods as possible to reduce it.  

So make time for relaxation, think about introducing stress relieving activities into your schedule *before* you feel like you need them, and above all, look after yourself!",1,1764097925.0,StudyMotives,0,1.0,False

Iris becomes the TA for her brilliant professor, Muse B, who is either freshly divorced or trapped in a dying marriage. Students whisper he used to be a “rising literary genius” before life steamrolled him.

Cue:

- late night grading
- shared coffee in his dim little office
- stolen glances over red pens and half finished manuscripts
- long hours blurring the lines between teacher/student, warmth/danger, want/shouldn’t

She notices everything he hides.
He notices everything she refuses to feel.

Their worlds start slipping together, her ballet rehearsals, his late lectures, their shared love of books, until one private moment gets too intimate, too warm, too absolutely career ending for him… and neither of them can step back.

If you want slow burn, forbidden tension, whispered confessions, two emotionally constipated people ruining their own lives beautifully .. I have snacks.

DMs are open!
I can send Iris’s full character sheet + expand on the plot in detail.
Come adopt this emotionally frozen ballerina and her sad, brilliant professor.",0,1764097861.0,roleplaying,0,0.5,False

1p6lbtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1p6lbtw/last_night/,Last night,"22:34. I have set the alarm on my phone for 07:23. The alarm on my ipad for 07:31. I do love me a good prime number. The clock will ring in 8 hours and 49 minutes from now. Yeah, right. I can’t remember the last time I have slept for a full 8 hours. 

I have checked the gas stove. I have checked the faucets. I ran the palm of my hand under the faucets 4 times- my palm is not wet, so the water is not running. More sensory input. All electrical devices are unplugged, bar my phone. My flatiron is unplugged, in the middle of the hallway, nothing flammable right next to it. I put my hand on it, the iron is cold. That’s good. More sensory input. I rub some disinfectant on my hands right before I go to bed. I make sure to empty my bladder.

One of my earliest memories- I must have been about 5 or 6- was not being able to sleep for a whole night. I still feel anxiety thinking about it. I remember meeting a patient diagnosed with insomnia. She was 12. The nurse exclaimed: “Poor girl! Insomnia at 12!” Poor girl indeed.

There’s a coffee chain in Ireland named insomnia. I have always wondered who the wanker who came up with that name is.

I went on a first date with a girl two weeks ago. I thought the date went well. She was wonderful, we had a lot of common interests and the conversation flowed well in my opinion. I tried kissing her at the end of the date. She refused. She later told me she simply wasn’t romantically interested but she wasn’t against the idea of us being friends. I had to refuse, since it was obvious that I was romatically interested in her. I don’t think that’s a good recipe for a friendship, although I genuinely would have loved to be her friend. I now try to rationalise it, I know I’m more than likely infatuated with my idealised version of her. But she’s not the reason I am not sleeping well. I wish I only had trouble sleeping when girls rejected me, life would be much easier.

About 15 minutes go by. I am starting to get the kind of random images and thoughts you usually get before you fall asleep. Is it going to be that easy? I get that falling feeling, and then I’m wide awake. Great. I go to the bathroom. I am aware it is physically impossible for me to have to pee again, but I know I won’t be able to fall asleep if I don’t do it.

Another hour goes by. Or at least it feels like an hour. I try not to look at the clock. Still wide awake. The one thing I am grateful for is that I don’t get that frustrated about not being able to sleep anymore. It’s just a fact of life. I’m aware I will fall asleep at some point, even though tonight seems to be a pretty bad night. Did I really check all the faucets? Did I unknowingly turn my alarms off? I try to dismiss these thoughts. Then I try to embrace them. None of the options seem to work. 

I go to the bathroom again, multiple times. I put my hand under the faucet each time to make sure it’s not wet. Things have gotten slightly better though. I used to turn the lights on to get visual confirmation that the water is not running. I also used to recheck my alarms each time I went to the bathroom, and you can bet I had a complex ritual for that as well.

I can’t resist the temptation so I look at the clock. 02:17. I do finally fall asleep sometime between 02:30 and 03:00. I dream something unpleasant. I wake up glad that I quickly forgot what I was dreaming. I usually remember my dreams. But it’s all good. Dreams are confirmation of the fact that I actually fell asleep.

I look at the clock. 05:42. I doubt I will be able to fall asleep again and that turns out to be true. But I am too tired to do anything else so I just lie in my bed. I do finally get up about 10 minutes before the alarm. Why do I even bother setting 2 alarms? I can’t remember the last time I woke up after the alarm rang.
I feel hypomanic on my way to work. It doesn’t happen that often but it’s honestly a pretty pleasant state. I meet one of my colleagues.

“Yeah, I am having some trouble sleeping”

***Thursday***

A few minutes later, Lucas was still at a loss. Of course, he went through the morning’s motions — checking each of the team’s boards, reminding himself where they were up to. He even lingered over Castillo and Young’s cases, mapping out which blind alleys he could send them down while the internal investigation into them played out. 

But his mind never strayed far from that conversation — the commissioner, the inspector, and the bomb they’d just dropped on him.

“Hey.” Pepper’s voice cut in, her hand settling on his forearm. “You okay?” 

“Just trying to stay focused.” 

“If that’s what they wanted, they wouldn’t have dropped that bombshell first thing this morning.” 

He scowled at the board without really looking at it, then let out a short breath and turned toward her, resting his hip on the back of a chair. “I should’ve seen it coming though. I knew the boss was deliberately baiting me, and I fell for it anyway. I should have known something was—”

“I’m not talking about that,” Pepper said, her voice cutting him off. “I’m talking about what the boss said right at the end.”

Lucas pinched his lips together with a frown. “Yeah, I’m kinda pretending he hadn’t.”

“Well, he did.”

Lucas rubbed the back of his head, lowering his hand to squeeze his neck. “Have you heard what they’re all calling me now?” he asked, his eyes darting to the door behind her.

Pepper squinted.

“When I introduced myself to Caveat at the 9th, he said, *‘Oh, the Poster boy of 1PP. I should’ve known’*.”

“That asshole,” Pepper hissed.

“But it’s true, isn’t it? With everything that’s fallen in my lap, I’m the perfect candi—”

Pepper’s squint lasted a moment longer, and then her eye opened wide. “Oh, fuck right off with that,” she said, giving him a substantial poke in the shoulder. “There’ve been a lot of rich cops on the force over the years. I mean *a lot.* Cops with the right connections, the right money, the gender — and they’re still assholes I wouldn’t piss on if they were on fire.”

Lucas refrained from commenting on her vulgarity, choosing to focus instead on the intent of her words … which was just as well, since she wasn’t done talking.

“They’re not interested in any of that. If they were, the Detective Nascerdios would be in the police commissioner’s sights. It’s what *you* bring to the table that has her so interested.”

She drilled him with her finger on the word ‘you’.

“Does the rest of the package help? Sure. You’re a good-looking guy who takes pride in his appearance. You dress well, but don’t let that define you. You have friends with money and power, but won’t allow any of that to improve your station amongst your peers. Hell, you just about took the inspector’s head off for suggesting you should’ve been above getting coffee for a fellow detective…”

“Because I spent an hour this morning trying to break the 9th out of that mentality. I wasn’t expecting to walk into it here.”

“You’re only proving my point, partner. *To you,* it changes nothing. You genuinely believe that every cop across the NYPD is equal to the one beside them. Just because you can give orders and expect them to be carried out, it doesn’t mean you see the uniform as less than the suit on you. Anyone can be a boss, Lucas, but only a handful can be a true leader.”

The silence drew out between them before Lucas grumbled, “What do I know about public speaking?”

“You could always ask a pro for pointers.”

Lucas felt his brow scrunch, for despite having a lot of power in his corner, not too many were in the public eye. Llyr technically fit the bill, but Lucas was confident his response to being told to do something he didn’t want to would be a resounding *‘fuck off’.*

Not helpful with the commissioner hovering.

“Who?”

“Don’t you have a brother in politics?”

Lucas groaned — his shudder of horror bordering on a convulsion. He hadn’t even thought of that. Jonathan would be all over the opportunity to trot out his connection to the NYPD’s poster boy.

And suddenly, Llyr’s take was the better option of the two.

\* \* \*

The 8am switch from being on duty with Sam to his chauffeur was always a challenge, as most weekday mornings, the car was in motion heading for either a therapy session, Skylar’s clinic, or the maritime school. Quent’s jump from off-duty to guard was easy enough, but he and Rubin had to switch out at a point where they wouldn’t cause a crash.

They’d perfected the move after weeks of practice, and it was only this morning that Sam finally noticed after Rubin pulled up at the lights in front of the Bronx River Parkway and disappeared, with Kulon taking the wheel a moment later. “You know, it wouldn’t kill Rubin to wait until he … I don’t know … *actually parked the car* before bailing on us.”

“Don’t worry about it, Sam,” Kulon said, shifting the car into gear and moving it forward with the traffic around them as if he had been there all along.

Sam grunted and looked out the window. *What’s up with Sam?* Quent asked, having only just joined them from his eight hours off.

*He didn’t say,* Rubin answered. *My bet, it’s starting to dawn on him that as of next week, he won’t be a student anymore. Some find that step exciting. Others find it daunting.*

Kulon doubted that was the issue, and twenty minutes later, his hunch was correct when they pulled up in the SUNY parking lot. Students on the green pointed them out and began to swarm towards the car, earning themselves a dark glower from Llyr’s youngest. Geraldine slid forward in her seat and all but swooned at the attention, so Sam kept his thoughts to himself.

*Smart man.*

*Humans can certainly smell money, can’t they?* Quent asked, drawing a low hum of agreement from Kulon as he climbed out of the car and went around to let Geraldine and Sam out.

*Keep an eye on Geraldine. She’s the biggest risk to Sam triggering.*

*I know how to do my job, bro.*

After Sam and Geraldine were safely deposited at school (and securing a grumbled promise from Quent that he could handle the situation without him), Kulon returned to SAH and resumed his seat in the corner beside Sonya.

Several times over the next hour, he and Khai shared a begrudging head nod as the healer came out to collect new patients and send off the old, and twice he felt more than saw War Commander Angus’ presence sweep through the building.

Ironically, outside of the Prydelands (and wherever the Eechee happened to be standing, since she was always accompanied by a full contingent of true gryps and Dee, her human-looking guard with the physical capabilities of a Highborn Hellion Guard and the mental strengths of a crystalline warrior), this was by far the most secure building in the world. 

Which was why Kulon straightened in his seat when someone familiar strolled toward the sliding front doors — someone who hadn’t been on the sidewalk a moment earlier. The teen wore shredded denim, a neon anime shirt, and sported sandy-blond hair that looked deliberately windswept.

Nuncio stepped inside with a grin, waving off Sonya’s pleasantries like background noise. “Thought I’d find you here,” he said, eyes skipping right over the receptionist to fix on Kulon.

Sonya exhaled, unimpressed.

“Don’t you have a kid to go fawn over?” Kulon asked, as the megaannum brat spun on his heels and flopped into the chair beside him.

“Now, now. Don’t be getting all bent out of shape, or I’ll take back my present for you before you’ve even seen it.”

It took Kulon a second to realise what gift he could be referring to, then straightened. “Wait. You’ve made up the locator bead already?”

Nuncio waved his hand in a dismissive flick, adding the necessary sound effects to show Kulon he was being utterly ridiculous. *“Duuuuude.* This thing here talks to your thing there. A cross-device communication. *Helllooo.”* He flipped his hands toward himself, like Kulon needed reminding of who he was dealing with.

When Kulon refused to engage, Nuncio dropped his hands and huffed in annoyance. “Anywho,” he added, reaching into his pocket. “I made up this little doohickie before I got banished to the Isle of Crap last week. Apparently, it’s for you.” He pulled out a sea-green bead the size of a shoestring aglet and flipped it into Kulon’s hand with a magician’s flourish. “Ta-daa.” His impish grin allowed the tiny fangs to appear. “And it’ll only cost you a favour of my choo—” 

Kulon’s hand clamped onto Nuncio’s thigh, claws punching through denim and into flesh. He leaned in, as if they were old friends catching up. “You weren’t seriously about to manipulate a blood oath out of the true gryps, were you?” Kulon’s grip tightened as he asked, leaning into his visitor as if they were old friends catching up quietly.

Nuncio’s smile was all teeth, but his instincts kept him from either neutralising the pain or disengaging it. “No, no. Hell, no…of course not…why would you ever think such a—” A grunt escaped him as Kulon retracted his nails. “Oww,” he pouted, rubbing his hand over the five puncture wounds. By the second pass of his hand, the fabric had been repaired and blood-free, and because Kulon hadn’t used his more dangerous tefsla claws, the wounds underneath healed even faster. “Jerk.”

That didn’t stop him from sniffling, milking the moment like he’d been mortally wounded.

Right on cue, Sonya rose from her seat, peering over the counter. 

“Are you alright, young man?”

Kulon wanted to scream at the mischievous gleam that entered Nuncio’s eyes right before he looked up at her. Kulon got in first. “I’ll hurt you for real, brat,” he muttered out the corner of his mouth. “I mean it.”

He could almost see the choices bouncing around in Nuncio’s head. “Yeah, I’m good,” the communication god finally said, his expression a blend of amused and slightly annoyed. “Kulon here is no fun.”

“Oh, so you two do know each other?”

“For a *very* loose definition,” Kulon answered with a frustrated sigh. “He’s my boss’ nephew. We used to live on opposite sides of the same complex before I moved to New York. He’s just here to annoy me.”

“Well, if you’re here to cause trouble, young man, perhaps you could move along and make your scene somewhere else?” Sonya suggested pointedly.

Nuncio’s smile grew until it revealed all his teeth, and Kulon knew he wasn’t going to like what came next out of his mouth. “She’s doing your job for you, bozo! I thought you were supposed to be the big bad security guard.”

*Eechee’s nephew. Eechee’s nephew. Eechee’s nephew.* “If you could just tell me how to use the bead, and then go away, that would be *really* super.”

“Awwww…that almost sounded as if you don’t like me,” Nuncio made another mocking sniffle, pretending to wipe a non-existent tear away with his bent knuckle. But all semblance of sorrow vanished in an evil cackle as Kulon’s fist clenched. “Fine, you big baby. I’ll cut you some slack, this once.” He raised his left hand and made gimme fingers. “Your phone, birdbrain. You already have the app on it.”

Kulon wasn’t sure what part of that comment he wanted to react to first, but settled on the least murderous one. *I do?* Without a word, he fished out his phone and handed it over. Nuncio tapped in the code lock and opened the home screen, turning it back to face Kulon.

“See?” he asked, pointing at the central icon that managed to be half as big again as any other icon around it. The letters A and I were written in embellished gold on a black background with a gold scrollwork border. “Right there. Big and bold in the Mystallian style. Even you can’t miss it.”

Kulon gritted his teeth as he took back his phone, wondering what it would take to at least shrink the icon back to a regular size. “Let me guess. AI. What — ghost in the machine? Divine tech edition?”

Nuncio’s scowl of disgust would’ve been funny under any other circumstances. “That’s not an I, you dickhead! It’s a one. As in A1, or Awesome One, because me, obvs.” He continued to shake his head. “Seriously, for fuck’s sake. Try to keep up, soldier-boy.”

*Eechee’s nephew. Eechee’s nephew. Eechee’s nephew.*

Right about now, the Hulk punch that sent Thor flying at the end of the Chitauri war was sooooooo insanely tempting. He closed his eyes and pictured it for a moment, relishing in the holes that would be left across multiple buildings before Nuncio stopped, then opened his eyes once more. “So, this app,” he said, tapping on the image.

Honestly, he half expected something just as annoyingly Nuncio once the app opened, but instead, there was an above view of the exact room he was sitting in, with a sea-green dot that matched the bead in his hand. Everyone, even the visitors with their pets, was accounted for. The only one who was hazed out was Nuncio himself.     

This is a live feed,” Kulon whispered, not wanting to draw *anyone else’s* attention to it. “How…?” The words fell away as the door to Consult Two opened and Mason stepped out with a client. On Kulon’s screen, parts of the hallway going down towards the treatment room had been drawn in pencil, but as soon as the client came out with his phone in his hand, sections of the feed blinked into clarity.

“You hacked everyone’s phones?” Kulon hissed incredulously.

“Fuck no. As if I’d do anything that tacky. The bead’s location is hooked directly into my vantaweb, and your app sees its bead through that lens. Anytime there’s any sort of communication anywhere near your boy, you can see him. Just pinch to zoom in on him alone or flick out wide to see how far away from you he really is.”

He then reached over Kulon’s shoulder and, with one finger, pushed the screen until the visual in front of the dot was exactly like what Kulon could see from where he sat. “This gives you vertical. If he’s on the fiftieth floor and you’re in the basement, you’ll still find him.” 

Nuncio leaned back with a grin, one sharp fang catching the light. “Come on. Say it. Three little words.” 

He wriggled his fingers. 

“Th-th-th-th…”

Kulon tipped his head back against the wall and exhaled a sigh so guttural it could have passed for a death rattle. “Thank you, Nuncio.”

That’s where a smart drinking water machine steps in as a game-changer. Designed to make hydration easier and healthier, these intelligent devices combine modern technology with advanced filtration systems, ensuring you always have access to pure water with minimal effort. But with so many models on the market, how do you choose the right one for your home or office?

First off, let’s talk about **filtration quality**. A good smart drinking water machine should come equipped with multi-stage filters, such as activated carbon, reverse osmosis, or UV sterilization. These layers work together to remove heavy metals, bacteria, viruses, and even unpleasant tastes or odors. Look for certifications or test reports to ensure the machine meets safety standards.

Next, consider **smart features and connectivity**. Some machines come with touch screen panels, real-time water quality monitoring, automatic filter change reminders, and even mobile app integration. These features might seem like luxury at first, but they can dramatically improve your daily experience. For instance, being notified when a filter needs replacing means you’ll never unknowingly drink contaminated water.

Then there's the **design and convenience**. Space-saving designs with a sleek aesthetic can complement any kitchen or office environment. Machines with hot and cold water options are especially practical—great for instant coffee, tea, or baby formula. Don’t forget to check the water tank capacity and flow rate, especially if you have a large family or busy office.

Another key factor is **energy efficiency**. Newer models often come with energy-saving modes or low power consumption features, reducing your environmental footprint while saving on utility bills. Noise levels also matter—especially if you’re placing it in a quiet home or office setting.

**Drinking Water Machine** systems should also be easy to maintain. Look for models that allow tool-free filter replacement and have components that are easy to clean. The less hassle involved in maintenance, the more likely you’ll keep the machine in top condition.

In short, a smart drinking water machine isn’t just a household appliance—it’s a lifestyle upgrade. Choose one that balances performance, convenience, and innovation to elevate your daily hydration routine. Make smart hydration a priority today.",1,1764097471.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

A moment when you stop chasing sparks and start craving something steady and honest. I think I am in that moment now.

In the past few months, I have crossed paths with a couple of genuinely wonderful women here. The conversations were warm and thoughtful. They did not turn into something lasting, and that is completely fine. They reminded me of the kind of man I have grown into. Someone who values depth, who listens with intention, who believes that the right things never need to be forced.

At my core, I am an old rock soul. Artists like Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, etc., are not just music to me; they are a mood, a way of slowing down and truly feeling things. I am the man who finds meaning in guitar riffs, late night drives, and the silence between songs. I travel the same way. With attention, with curiosity, with a strange affection for details that most people miss. Sunlight on old buildings, conversations overheard in a café, the quiet beauty of a place that is new but somehow familiar. I do not collect destinations. I collect moments that stay.

I am a lawyer by profession, but my spirit leans toward the old world. Good manners. Thoughtful words. Coffee that is never rushed. A preference for people who speak with clarity and care. I am not interested in noise or drama. I am drawn to emotional maturity, to women who are grounded, self aware, sensitive without losing their strength, and steady without losing their warmth.

If you are someone who has lived enough to know what you want, someone who prefers meaning over momentum, someone who wants a connection that feels like ease and not effort, we might find something real. Something that grows slowly and stays.

And if not, that is perfectly alright. You will still find me by the window, coffee in hand, travel plans in my mind, Pink Floyd playing softly, trusting that the right story always finds its way.

I am not here for the fleeting. I am here for the honest. For something that feels like home, even when it is new.

Up for something meaningful, cheers to life! :)",1,1764097407.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1p6l6xq,https://i.redd.it/il1a7da2bg3g1.jpeg,How choosing a checking account with no overdraft fees can save you hundreds,"We’ve all experienced overdraft fees at one point or another. You grab a coffee, pay a bill, or fill up your tank, and then realize your account balance was a little too low. Suddenly, your bank hits you with a $35 overdraft fee that’s more expensive than the latte you just bought.

Luckily, there’s a better way to protect your hard-earned money. All you have to do is open a  checking account with no overdraft fees.

# Overdraft fees cost more than you think

At $30 or $35 per transaction, an overdraft fee might not seem like a big deal at first. However, it’s one of the most common ways people lose money without realizing it.

Let’s say you accidentally overdraw your account by $10 a few times in a month. If your bank charges $35 per overdraft, that’s more than $100 gone in fees just for being a few dollars short.

That’s money that could’ve gone toward groceries, savings, or literally anything more useful.

# How a checking account with no overdraft fees helps

When you switch to a checking account with no overdraft fees, you immediately remove a layer of financial stress. Instead of punishing you for small mistakes, these checking accounts are built to help you stay on track.

Here’s what makes them a game-changer:

* **No surprise charges:** Even if your balance dips below zero, you won’t get hit with a fee.
* **Smarter balance tools:** Many of these accounts come with spending alerts or real-time updates to help you stay informed.
* **Overdraft protection apps:** Some banks and apps offer built-in overdraft protection features that cover small shortfalls automatically with no interest or penalties.

# Why it’s worth making the switch

Switching to a checking account with no overdraft fees is more than just a money move, it’s a mindset shift. It can help you take control over your finances and get back on track. 

Here’s what you could gain:

* More control over your budget.
* Less anxiety about small mistakes.
* Hundreds of dollars back in your pocket every year.

# When you need a hand, turn to Dave

If you find your account running low and need to dodge an overdraft fee ASAP, ExtraCash^(®) is here to help. You could get up to $500 with no credit check, interest, or late fees and top up your account before you go in the red.^(1) Because you deserve financial solutions that work as hard as you do.

1p6l672,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1p6l672/im_noticing_something_about_christian_singles/,I'm noticing something about Christian singles groups and Christian dating culture,"So I have been in a few Christian singles chats and attended some events and I need to be honest… something feels off. I grew up in the church so I am used to Christian culture but the dating side of it is a whole different world.

Here is what I have noticed.

A lot of Christians are extremely passive when it comes to dating. They want marriage but they do not pursue anything. They wait for some magical moment where God sends them their spouse at a coffee shop. I am all for faith but you cannot meet someone if you never make a move. People in these groups will debate for two hours but won’t ask anyone out.

There is also a strange obsession with gender roles. Every conversation eventually turns into men being “logical” and women being “emotional” or who should lead and who should submit. It is like watching a lecture instead of normal adults trying to build connections. I am not even against healthy roles but the way they talk about it makes it sound like they have never interacted with real people.

Another thing I noticed is that a lot of them seem emotionally underdeveloped. They get offended easily and misunderstand simple comments. You cannot have a normal conversation without someone feeling attacked. If a woman says something that is not soft and agreeable it is treated like a crisis. If a man expresses a preference it turns into an argument about the entire male population. I also get the feeling that people try too hard to act holy. It all feels so fake and inauthentic.

The biggest thing I noticed is that many of them talk about relationships more than they actually live life. They debate dating all day but do not actually date. They run from vulnerability and hide behind long paragraphs that make them feel wise. It feels like a group therapy session with Bible verses sprinkled in.

I am not saying everyone is like this but the pattern is real. It made me realise that a lot of Christian singles are not struggling because “God is preparing them.” They are struggling because they avoid risk and expect a spouse to fall into their lap without doing any of the emotional work.

I am curious if anyone else has noticed the same thing or if it is just the groups I happened to join.",7,1764097308.0,ChristianDating,14,0.89,False
1p6l5x5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6l5x5,New Middle Earth art (OC),"Heyo! So last year I posted 60 days worth of Middle Earth inspired art. Each piece was a daily deep dive into the text and world Tolkien built as a personal challenge to see what sort of visual representation I could conjure without letting the movies influence my work (to the best of my ability). Y’all seemed to really enjoy my interpretations, so I’ve been busy updating and refining them. These a a few of my recent pieces made on ancient paper that I treated myself with a combination of tearing and burning edges, staining with black tea, coffee, turmeric, and baking it in an oven. Plus additional shading and brush work after. These prints (as well as just normal untreated prints) are now available on my new website joshwolfdraws.com!

I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming encouragement you showered me. I’m sorry for the absence this year, but this community really inspired me to go for it and make my art more public. Like I said, I’m working on updating the rest, so stay tuned for more pieces to come flooding in like the Bruinen! Thank you all for your support in my humble little fledgling art career.

&nbsp;

#ANNOUNCEMENTS

&nbsp;

**Event Notes**

- This is considered one of the most player-friendly maps.
- There are no Infinite Harvestables used as keys, and since they are over-sized you can easily bubble them.
- Some of the tiles behind the early Cloud Key Locks have high healing requirements.
- There is a level 4 Fruit Tree near the top of the map.
- If anyone wants to contribute screenshots of lock areas immediately after they’ve been opened, please share the images in the comments — they’ll be edited into this guide as soon as possible.
  - *Still needing a screenshot for the Golden Capsule lock.*
- **WARNING:** Taking a screenshot of your rewards page early in the event (and of Act 2 as soon as its unlocked) is strongly advised, as rewards shown may change over the course of the event.  The most recent edition of this bug *may* have been fixed by the most recent 12.14 update — if you see it happen after that, please comment.  
  - There have been multiple problems with changing rewards in the last couple years, so taking screenshots before starting ANY event is good insurance for future missing items. 

**News and Updates:**

- **FREEBIES:** A free, 8-day Thanksgiving/Black Friday giveaway is now available on the [Merge Dragons Web Store](https://www.mergedragons.com/store-md)
- **SUBREDDIT UPDATE:** We’ve updated the Subreddit’s Rule 2 to specifically ban bot accounts (including AI or karma-farming activity), since we’re seeing a big increase in this; such accounts will be banned upon discovery, but appeals are always available thru mod-mail if a real player gets caught up by accident.  *If you see a suspect post or comment, please report it!*
- **NOTICE:  Gram Games has pulled back the change to Decision Eggs**, and restored the re-roll function that has been present all these years.  Updating to the newest version of v12.14 is required, and a device reboot may be necessary to trigger the fix.
- **GLITCH: Missing Cards**  Some players may see incorrect prize items in place of the usual card packs on the reward screen in events; if you do not get your card packs after collecting the rewards, contact Game Support for replacements.
- **GLITCH:**  Items held by dragons may be deleted upon exiting camp.
- **GLITCH:**  Event and Season Portal tasks involving nests, eggs, or dragons are not registering properly, meaning these tasks cannot be completed until a patch arrives in a future update.
- **GLITCH:**  Level 3 shiny dragons are unmergeable;  this issue should be patched by v12.14 — please let us know if you see it after that.
- **GLITCH:**  Dragon/egg numbers are inaccurate in the Discovery Book; some graphic displays and labels may also be misplaced, including on dragons out in camp.  Some issues are temporarily fixed by hard-closing/re-opening the game from the world map screen.
- **BRAND-NEW BETA: Ezra's Relic Run** is a limited-time event where players collect themed chain items from various parts of the game. Chain items can be collected from Bingo, Shiny Days, and various purchase sources. The main goal is to discover every level of the chain items, culminating in obtaining the “Memento,” which stays permanently in your camp. Players need 200DP to unlock the event. *Reminder: Please use Spoiler tags and the “New and/or Beta” flare when posting about this feature.*
- **BETA: Item Storage**  A new feature grants item storage in a similar fashion to the Egg Storage Facility. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n1lhxk/item_storage/)
  - GLITCH: Numbers listed on the storage facility may be inflated; only fully emptying the facility will give a true count of what you own.  
  - GLITCH: The facility may discharge items upon exiting camp; any items placed on the tile a previously stored item was last using will be bubbled.
- **BETA: Camp Dawnvale**  The testing pool continues to expand as devs work out the kinks in the new secondary camp; WARNING: once a player gets access to this feature, it may drastically affect the possible rewards offered by events or other features. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n5znsb/new_camp_camp_dawnvale/) *Reminder: Please use Spoiler tags and the “New and/or Beta” flare when posting about major new features or beta tests like this.*
- **BETA: MergeDragons Plus**  An add-on APK for Android-based has launched; it seems to function similarly to the Dragonia VIP club, and so far has no direct relationship with game-play — it’s all on the financial side.  Functionality has been an issue (early testers’ games were bricked), and security may be a concern; please read the terms and conditions thoroughly and do your own research on the companies involved. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n0snvz/merge_dragons_plus/)
- **BETA: Potions**  A beta feature involving consumable booster potions is now out to a small but growing number of test players. Reliability has been an issue; if it doesn’t work for you, please report this to Game Support so they can pass it on to the team in charge of this beta test. Reimbursement of gems wasted on non-functioning potions is not guaranteed, but providing screenshots/video may help. [Initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1m0oium/potions_in_camp/)
- **REMINDER:**  If you are experiencing technical issues, please contact Game Support with a description of the problem, where it occurred (if in an event, please name it and if it’s an OoC, please specify Act 1 or 2), approximately when it occurred, and (if possible) attach a recording or screenshot(s) of the issue.  Programmers *need* official support tickets to start an investigation, and having multiple players reporting on the same problem lets them directly compare affected accounts.
- **Popular Links:**
  - [Friend Tag List 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1jyqpx4/official_friend_tag_list_2025/)
  - [Dens List 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1jyqpud/official_dens_list_2025/)
  - [MD Web Store](https://www.mergedragons.com/store-md) - A free, event-related trophy breed egg can usually be claimed soon after the start of a weekend event, except if it’s a brand new theme or if there’s a delayed start (it messes up the store update coding for unknown reasons).

**Other Events:**

- **Next OoC Event:**   Gemland Kingdom, Nov 28 - Dec 1 *New!*
- **Prize Hunt, aka Bunny Bingo:** Held with all weekend OoCs, plus occasional holiday mid-weeks.
  - NOTE: Bingo may run in mid-week events for a limited number of players in the Dragonia VIP Club as part of an A/B test. 
  - WARNING: This feature REQUIRES players to spend gems and/or make cash purchases to complete.
  - Tapping a square brings up the specific task requirements.
  - Dragons must be created by merging up to the target level in camp to count for “get” tasks.
  - “Level chests” refer to the [Bountiful Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Bountiful_Chest#Types) gained by completing levels.
  - [Dragon Shrine Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Shrine) must be purchased for 200 gems each.
  - [Level 1 Chance Chests](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Chance_Chests) are randomly included in ~20% of Kala’s Daily Trade Rucksacks and Daily Rewards; L2 or L3 do not count.
  - [Life Flower Totems](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Life_Flower_Totem) cost 160 gems to buy for use in camp; if the task says ‘anywhere’, totems can be tapped for free in levels like Totem Shire 12, Golden Meadow 10 or 19, Spell Shore 3 or 17, and Glacier Falls 5 or 15.
  - The trophy dragon breed required is usually the OoC event’s Secondary Trophy breed (link in guide below); it must be the exact level listed by the task.
- **Races:**  Tuesday and Sunday [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Race_Event)
  - Next Up:  Mushrooms on Tuesday, Dragon Trees on Sunday
- **Shiny Days:** Monday and Wednesday  [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Shiny_Days_Event)
  - BETA:  An expanded, 2 page Shiny Days is currently being tested.
- **Mystic Challenge:**  Thursday and Sunday
  - NOTE: A technical error caused the Nov 20 edition to begin an hour late; future events should start at the standard 19:00 GMT.
  - A/B Test: A limited group of players will receive Thanksgiving-themed MCs over the holiday period.
- **Card Collection:** Runs in an 8-week cycle; NOTE: Joker cards must be used as soon as collected.
- **Kingdoms:** Currently open Monday-Thursday; daily chests reset at 19:00 GMT
- **Elemental Events:** Beta testing is back, most recently held Tuesday-Friday on new Season weeks. Multiple testers report gem purchases are now required to finish this event.
- **Quinn’s Lucky Games, aka Spin-the-Wheel**: Testing has restarted, but little has changed; it’s still a standard online gambling format, complete with a guaranteed big win at first to give you a nice dopamine high and make you feel “lucky”.

#EVENT FAQs

- The Event Shop and Capsules appear after healing 30-70 tiles; after that a free Bronze Capsule can be collected every 3 hours.
- It takes 5 to 6 level 9 Life Orb of the Heavens to clear all the 5k+ land, depending on how much you heal by merging items off dead land.
- To collect both the full set of Points Prizes and any level of Rush Rewards, you will need to earn 29,950 points.
  - Reaching this amount requires 1x Level 9 points item, 1x L8 item, 2x L7 items, and 2x L6 items (or just aim for 2x L9 points items).
- There’s enough material to merge by 3s when making Key items.
- The *Gold Capsule*, *Fallen Star*, and *Tanzanite Nest* are hiding near the far edge of the map, on tiles requiring 50k energy to heal.
- Caves must be tapped to spawn an Event [Zomblin](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Zomblins#Event_Zomblins); only one Zomblin lives in each cave, and if the cave is destroyed before being tapped it will not spawn anything useful.  When an Event Zomblin is killed, it spawns *Stinky Cheese* that can be harvested to start the [Spirit Lantern](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Lanterns) chain, which feeds into the [Spirit Rose](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Rose) chain, which produces *Dark Roses* and the *Spectral Rose Bush*.
- **Infinite Harvestables:**
  - There are 9x Level 1, 3x L2, 1x L3, 2x L4, and 2x L5 Infinite Harvestables (the *Autumn Hideouts*) on the map; you can delete one level 1 and one level 2 and still have enough to make a level 6, as long as you 5-merge whenever possible.
  - **Note:** No Infinite Harvestables are used as keys in this event.
- **Consumable/Limited Harvestables:**
  - Each 1x2 *Plashing Maple Tree* can be harvested 25 times; 75 total harvests are needed to complete Quest 1.3.
  - Each harvest of the big 2x2 *Maple Tree Falls* at the back of the map yields a 10% chance of spawning an extra *Plashing Maple Tree*.
  - Once all available *Plashing Maple Tree* and the *Maple Tree Falls* are gone, there is no way to get more.
- **Strategy Advice:**
  - Spending money or gems is NEVER required to complete Act 1 of an event, nor is using an auto-clicker or other exploits — not even for the Rush Rewards. Act 2 Point rewards can be earned without any exploits, but Event Quests likely cannot for the higher difficulty type maps.
  - The number and level of possible reward items is determined by your Event Portal level; working to raise that to its maximum of L16 is one of the best ways to boost your overall progress in the game

  - Additional general event strategy advice (active vs passive or idle play, etc) can be found in the [Community FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/wiki/index) and in these threads: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/w99r81/share_your_event_top_tips_please), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/uqa9q0/a_walkthru_of_my_method_to_complete_every_event), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wi3gm4/events), and [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/dgk9da/step_by_step_guide_to_completing_events), [Link 5](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Guide_and_Tips).
  - For active players wanting more dragons, the Prism Flower method is a good option: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/18jw6om/detailed_explaination_of_the_prism_flower_method/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/nihcnu/a_twist_on_the_prism_flower_method_for_events/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wns1tb/do_you_use_the_prism_flower_method_in_events/). *Note: this technique is only for active play; since only 2 dragons at a time will harvest when left on their own, having more will actually slow down idle harvesting.*
  - A strategy using the Hills chain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/16pidhi/comment/k20zcta/) can greatly increase Life Flower production, but it usually takes a few gems (maximum of 80, but less if you get some in capsules).

#Act 2 FAQs

- **NOTE: Act 2:** The devs have been increasing the difficulty of this part of the event in recent weeks; healing requirements, Booster Chest points, and overall point requirements have all been affected — check the comment section for the latest info on what other players are seeing.
- Act 2 is an expanded version of standard Out-of-Camp events available to players with at least 5,000 dragon power; it allows players to replay the current event at a higher difficulty level for extra rewards as soon as they finish the original version (aka Act 1). The Act 2 start screen appears as soon as you earn the 10^th Points reward; you can choose to remain in Act 1, but once you begin Act 2 you cannot go back. Players that return to Act 1 can move on at any time by tapping the “Act 2” button under the event name.
  - NOTE: The very first time a player activates Act 2, a tutorial start screen appears with no option to return to Act 1.
- **Maps:** The maps follow the same general layout as Act 1, with an increased healing requirements for most tiles. Early Life Flower/Orb keys may be upgraded, grasses are replaced with Life Orbs, and Life Flowers given a higher level. Infinite Harvestables and key items are in the same locations as Act 1; Healing Goddesses are sprinkled around the map, but have little impact on progress.
- **Points:**
  - As of late September, collecting all 10 reward levels needs ~46,540 points, or the equivalent of 2x level 9 point items plus 1x level 8 and 1x level 7.
  - Collecting only the first 8 rewards needs 1x level 9 point item plus 1x level 6 item; collecting only the first 6 rewards needs 1x level 8 point item plus 1x level 7 item plus 2x level 6 items.
  - NOTE: Some players have recently reported different point values; how widespread this is remains to be seen.
- **Healing:**  The healing requirements are still being adjusted by the devs; in general the number of higher energy tiles has increased, and the easy-to-heal area at the start has shrunk. 
  - Recent reports say it’s taken 18-20 level 9 Life Orbs to heal the full map, but this may vary substantially as the devs continue tweaking requirements.
- **Booster Chests:** Opening Event Chests, Capsules, and Dimension Jars and purchasing items from the store in Act 1 yield points that earn bonus items for use in Act 2.  **UPDATE:** Booster Chest point requirements appear to be undergoing adjustment by the devs, with significant increases for at least some players.
  - Bronze Capsules = 12 points each, level 2 Event Chests = 6p, and Dimension Jars = 20p
- **Gold Pass:** The Act 1 Gold Pass does not carry over to Act 2, which has its own, separate Gold Pass available for purchase at the same price; you can buy one, both, or neither.
- **Event Quests:** Event Quest progress is reset and task difficulty increases *drastically* in Act 2; finishing in Act 1 is recommended if you wish to earn the EQ rewards.
- **Strategy Advice:** Most OoC strategies work, but healing the full Act 2 map is extremely difficult.
  - The simplest strategy is to heal and clear out the low-energy tiles near the start, then merge up and idle farm a pair of level 2 Infinite Harvestables; point rewards can comfortably be finished in a day if mass-merging 1-2 times per hour.
  - Merging up to a pair of level 3 IH will speed up progress, but the difficulty of this varies by map design and placement of the existing L2 IH.
  - Remaining in Act 1 long enough to earn the level 4 Infinite Harvestable may pay off by allowing a single dragon to harvest points with minimal land clearance; this is especially useful in cases where the L1 and L2 IH are difficult to clear, but recent changes to the booster point system may make this impractical for many… and lately there’s a glitch that has prevented some from getting the correct IH.
  - Prism Flowers cannot be purchased from the store, but seeds and sprouts are randomly included in some Bronze Capsules.

#SAVING YOUR PROGRESS

- Make sure to save your progress by traveling to the World Map screen (and waiting there until everything’s fully loaded) regularly, and especially before closing your game.  
- Exiting directly from the event level to your Camp can trigger a crash and/or loss of items; always exit to the World Map screen first, and again after releasing prize items into your camp, as well as after merging high-level or valuable dragons/items.

&nbsp;

***

#EVENT TROUBLESHOOTING

If the event is not showing up correctly or if glitches are affecting your play:

1. Check that you meet the version and dragon power requirements.
2. Try hard-closing and then relaunching your game.
3. Try rebooting your device (ie, turn it completely off, then back on and allow it to fully boot up before relaunching the game). If you are on wifi and have access to the router, try rebooting that, too.
4. Try switching to a completely different internet source.
5. Try clearing your game’s cache (google for instructions for your specific phone type).
6. If you’re suddenly experiencing multiple issues like lagging or error messages (or if the event vanishes completely), close the game and try again after 2-3 hours. Events are internet-based, and sometimes issues with the servers can cause temporary problems — all we can do for that is to wait it out.
7. If none of the above helps, contact Gram Games Support through the in-game link or the [Support Web Portal](https://gramgames.helpshift.com/hc/en/9-merge-dragons-1497457953/) for help figuring out what’s wrong; please include the name of the event and whether the problem is with Act 1 or 2.  If you use email, you’ll need your game ID and version number, both of which can be copied for pasting from the Settings tab, or (if you can’t get into the game at all) by hand from the game’s loading screen.

**Chronic Problems**  (*New warnings are added at the end of list*)

- **Cloud Save is still unreliable:** According to the last official statements from the developers, it is not safe to be used and should be left turned off. 
  - **WARNING:**  Support is apparently telling some players to use CS, however as of July, multiple players have confirmed Cloud Save is both 1) still wiping out player progress without warning, and 2) continuing to hit some players with intermittent saving failure messages, esp when using Facebook IDs.  Use at your own risk.
- **Glitch: Points not displaying/counting properly:**  Closing the game while inside the event will cause the event points to display incorrectly upon re-entry; exiting to the world map usually fixes this, but occasionally a full reboot — after closing from the world map screen — is required.
- **Glitch: Items from past events**  Sometimes capsules or booster chests may contain items from the previous OoC event, especially if it was new or nearly new; these items are not usable and can be deleted.

The Problem It Solves 🤔

Right now, collectors face these issues:

❌ Discovery is scattered

National Park checklist apps don't show you WHERE things are on a map
You rely on Google searches for ""Zoltar machines near me""
No central database for niche collections
❌ Logging is fragmented

Photos in your camera roll with no organization
Spreadsheets you forget to update
Check-in apps that don't understand your goal
❌ Sharing is complicated

""Let me show you all 42 MLB stadiums I've been to..."" scrolls through camera roll
Creating Instagram highlight reels is manual work
No way to show just your hiking collection vs. your food collection
What people really want: ""I want ONE app where I can see all the [thing I collect], track which ones I've visited, see my progress, and easily share my journey.""

You: ""Oh that's cool! So it works for anything?""

You: ""So it's like Pokémon GO but for real life?""

Me: ""Exactly! Except instead of catching fictional creatures, you're collecting real experiences. And you're building a visual journal of your life adventures.""

That was seven years ago. It’s been seven years, and he hasn’t talked to or touched another woman since. He refuses to go out. He refuses to talk to women. He refuses to buy new clothes. He always has the same excuse: “I used to do that all the time back when I was younger.” He’s 32.

It just sucks because all he does is complain about how he doesn’t get laid, and then he refuses to do anything that would help him get laid. He doesn’t want to go to parties. He doesn’t want to go to bars. He doesn’t want to go to clubs. He doesn’t want to go to the library, a coffee shop, or even the park. If it involves potentially meeting women, he does not want to go. And then he gets home and complains about how no women talk to him.

And the worst part is that when he does talk to women, he immediately starts complaining about how life is easier for women, how it’s different for him because he’s a man, and how everything is so hard. It’s like he’s allergic to coochie. I’m scared he’s gonna die alone, lmao. At this point, I can’t help him anymore.

There are far fewer sweepstakes-style casinos available to Canadians compared to Americans, which made the setup a bit trickier. Still, after going through the hassle of getting everything figured out, it’s been worth it.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now, and I’ve made a couple thousand dollars in total. It’s not life-changing money, but it’s a solid, low-effort side hustle that fits nicely into my routine. I usually just collect the daily free tokens while having my morning coffee. It takes maybe five minutes. Then, once or twice a month on a Friday night, I’ll play through those free tokens and try to convert them into redeemable tokens.

The nice thing is that there’s no real “buy-in” required if you’re patient. It’s all about consistency — collecting your daily bonuses, playing smart, and cashing out when you hit something worthwhile.

If anyone else here is doing this from Canada, I’d be curious to hear which sites you’ve had success with or how your experience compares. I can also share a few of the ones I’ve found that actually work here.",1,1764096844.0,MakeMoneyHacks,0,1.0,False

Hope this type of information helps others who are starting out.

* 2018: First A1C test of 5.8. Doc said don't worry.
* 2022: Second test, 6.3. This was a new doctor, she officially labeled me as pre-diabetic but said nothing to worry about ""just eat better and exercise""
* 2023: Down to 6.0. New city, new doctor. Sent me to nutritionist/dietician who said ""just eat better and exercise""
* 2024: Up to 6.3. Same doctor, no change.
* 2025: Up to 6.7 (these two years were very stressful as well for various reasons so that added to the misery). New doctor who is also diabetic. Told me to start Metformin and continue with current cycling (3-4 hrs a week plus some weights) and reduce carbs more. Gave me CGMs to track but I had to ask for it.
* 3 months later: Down to 6. I can see my average daily glucose has reduced from the 120 range to the high 90s. I know CGMs aren't always accurate but it's great being able to track changes over time. Also noticed that the early morning dawn phenomenon that I used to get has reduced from the 120s to around 100.

What I changed with diet is below. The changes to lunch and afternoon snack are since three months ago but others I have been trying for about six months:

* Coffee. Since work starts at 6am for me, I usually have two cups of coffee at 630-8am with Truvia and half and half.
* Breakfast around 8-9am. 3 eggs plus two slices of bread (Nature's Own Keto with 1g net carb) with butter and sugar free jam. Depending on the brand of jam, this breakfast takes me to about 125-145 peak. 
* Lunch. Instead of a full lunch, I first started trying various smoothies but I can't be bothered enough to make them regularly. So now I either don't at all or just snack on fruits (right now I am not limiting to low glycemic fruit because honestly, I just need more fruit in my diet regardless). Sometimes I'll get a high protein bar.
* Afternoon snack. I might raid my kids' cookies for a couple around 3pm. Sometimes I'll get a high protein bar.
* Dinner. Eat between 6-7pm; as much protein as I can while reducing portions of rice/bread compared to what I used to eat. No food after 7pm so I go without any food for 11 hours every night now.

I still occasionally have a bit of ice cream or a croissant and other bakery products but not like I used to. Haven't had any pasta or noodles in these three months except once and I regretted it so much.

So my escape artist Labrador, Luna, decided to recreate the great escape last month. She dug under the fence while I was working, and by the time I noticed, she'd been gone for 15 minutes. My heart literally stopped. But then I remembered - she was wearing her FurThrive GPS collar. I opened the app and there she was, two blocks over, probably chasing squirrels at the park. I had her back in my arms in under 5 minutes.

This isn't just another pet product - this thing literally brought my dog home. After seeing what it could do, I reached out to other FurThrive users, and their stories are just as powerful:

""My anxious rescue dog slipped his leash during a fireworks show. Normally, we'd be searching for hours, but with FurThrive, we found him hiding under a neighbor's porch in minutes."" - Sarah K., Colorado

""We take our border collie hiking every weekend. The virtual fence feature gives me peace of mind knowing I'll get an alert if she wanders too far chasing birds."" - Mike T., Oregon

# What Real Users Are Saying About FurThrive

After talking to dozens of other pet parents, here's what stands out:

**The Good Stuff Everyone Loves:**  
• ""The battery actually lasts like they say - I only charge it once a month""  
• ""The app shows their exact location in real-time, no guessing""  
• ""Survived my dog's swimming obsession and multiple mud baths""  
• ""The escape alerts came through instantly when my Houdini dog got creative""

**Things People Wish Were Better:**  
• ""There's a monthly fee, but honestly, it's worth every penny""  
• ""Took a minute to figure out all the app features""  
• ""Wish the collar came in more color options""

# Real People, Real Results

What's crazy is how many similar stories I found. Like Jessica from Texas who told me: ""My deaf dog got out during a storm. Without FurThrive, I don't know if I would have found her. The precise tracking led me right to her hiding spot behind a dumpster.""

Or Mark from Florida: ""We live near a busy road. The virtual fence has alerted us three times when our dogs got too close to the street. Probably saved their lives.""

# What You Need to Know

**It's not perfect, but it works:** Yeah, there's a monthly subscription (about the price of a coffee), and the initial cost isn't cheap. But every person I talked to said the same thing - when your dog is missing, you'd pay anything to get them back.

**The setup is pretty straightforward:** Took me about 10 minutes to get everything working. The app walks you through it step by step.

**It actually holds up:** Luna's dragged hers through mud, water, and who knows what else. Still going strong after 8 months.

# The Real Truth

Look, I'm just a dog mom who almost lost her best friend. I'm not a tech expert or a professional reviewer. But I've talked to enough FurThrive users to know this isn't just marketing hype. This thing works when it matters most.

**Quick tip from one pet parent to another:** I'll drop the link to the official site in the comments so you get the real deal with the warranty. The last thing you want is some knock-off that fails when you need it most.

Part 5- Jotaro Kujo

*“You will die, Kujo. But your friends will first.”*

*Emerald eyes.*

*Pale skin.*

*Tall and slender.*

*Golden hair.*

*DIO.*

Jotaro jolted awake, drenched in a cold sweat, alarm beeping insistently. *First nightmare in a while. Must be an auspicious day.* He checked the time- 9:00. *Overslept by two hours? Rohan will be pissed.*

Jotaro was efficient. By 9:02, he had donned his hat and trench coat, brushed his teeth and drank a half a litre of black coffee, attempting to distract his mind from the night’s visions. But there was much to distract it with- today, the gang were going to interview a suspect. *Though they’ve probably done it without me.* 

Jotaro called Rohan and Josuke, but to no avail. Only by 9:03 did the outside world interact with him- from his window at the Grand Morioh Hotel, he heard a blaring siren emitting from a green Fiat only half as tall as he was. The car had poorly parked beside the entrance of the hotel, crushing a postbox in its wake. *Moron,* Josuke thought, until he saw a little figure crawl out of the driver’s seat.

“MISTER KUJO!” It was Koichi, in all his miniature glory, clad in his green schoolclothes and satchel. He truly was tiny- five foot was being generous, but he carried himself as though he were far taller. His Stand, Echoes, had the ability to increase the weight of any object exponentially, including areas of the body. Not one Stand user had been able to resist the weight- apart from Jotaro Kujo.

Jotaro cracked open a window. “Koichi? What’s the meaning of this?”

“They’ve found the killer! Get down here now!”

Jotaro obliged. He snatched his wallet, and rooted around in his desk for some stray bullets. His Star Platinum was fast and precise enough to launch bullets at the speed of normal guns, *something this Kira would rue.*

By 9:05, he was out of the lobby and onto the patio, where Koichi was being hassled by some hotel employees.

“You’re gonna have to pay for that mailbox, kid!”

“Sorry sir! It was an accident, I-

“I don’t want to hear your excuses-

“Is there a problem here?” Jotaro rolled his huge figure in between the staff and Koichi, before their smug demeanours slowly dissipated.

“Do you know this kid, Mr Kujo?”

“Yes.” Jotaro was a man of few words.

“Then n-n-no there isn’t, sir. Have a good day.”

The workers went on their way, but were halted by their manager halfway to the door.

“Hey, you need to pay for that! You, or you Mr Kujo! You can’t just-

Kujo threw a fat stack of yen at his feet. “That enough? The fuck off.”

Jotaro turned back to the car. “So, you drove this, thing?” The car was perfectly Koichi sized- green like his school uniform, small and compact. Jotaro dreaded entering.

“Barely. You have a car, right?”

“Nope.”

“You don’t?”

“No.”

“Why?”

“Public transport.”

“But can you drive?”

“Yes.” Jotaro took a step forward towards the driver’s seat, and crouched. “But I’m not fitting in there. I’ll hop in the back.”

“I have to drive?”

“You made it this far.” Koichi sighed, and hopped onto the driver’s seat, slouching until he was almost laying down to reach the pedals. Jotaro launched himself into the backseat, smacking his head as he went.

Koichi took off immediately, slamming into the car in front of him. He then proceeded to reverse into the car behind him, and repeated himself twice more. Only after more property damage did Koichi manage to swerve through the grass island in the car park and onto the road.

“What do you know, Koichi?”

“Hayato Kawajiri called me, his kid. Apparently Josuke and Okuyasu found Kira- he stole the face of Hayato’s father like we assumed. His Stand has seemed to increase in power since we faced him- Hayato mentioned that he gained a new ability.”

“A new ability?”

“He calls it Bites the Dust. It allows him to turn back time to a specific point in the day if his son tells anyone about his identity, but only an exact hour afterwards. And we all die if he does.”

“How long do we have?”

“Till 9:24 he said, so about eighteen minutes.” Koichi danced around the incoming traffic in a flurry of horns and sirens. *So he’s even more powerful than when we faced him.* Koichi and he found Kira, in his first body, lingering at a suit store. He used tricks to defeat them, before Jotaro blew the brakes off him. He had to use the World. He didn’t want to have to use it again.

“You think you’ll use the World?”

*Way to go Koichi.* It was the apex of Stand abilities, learnt from the mighty Lord Dio himself. But whenever he did, the nightmares came. All those he lost in his quest to kill the vampire god- Muhammad Avdol, Iggy, and his dear friend Kakyoin, even Josuke’s dad Joseph for a moment. They berated him for his failure- he couldn’t save them. *Who else will I let die today?* Jotaro gritted his teeth. *No one. No more innocent blood on my hands, not now, not ever. Curse you, Dio.*

“Perhaps. Where are we going?”

“32nd street. We’re coming up on it now.”

The street was long and narrow, dense in the suburbs, but deserted. Apart from the smoking ruin of a car, and the bloodied man in a white suit screaming in the middle of the road. *That’ll be him. Yoshikage Kira.* He saw three bodies lined up against the car- Josuke’s hair standing bold and bright in the rain. *Did Dio reach out beyond the grave to ensure that more would die under my watch?*

Just as Koichi was getting closer, three ambulances wailing came down the road, opposite to the green Fiat. *Shit. Innocents. We’ll play it safe. No lives will be lost, except Kira’s own.*

By 9:16, Koichi was thirty feet away from Kira, and he hadn’t turned his head once.  
“Should I hit him?”

“Excellent idea.”

Koichi complied. In about five more seconds, Koichi had implanted a Kira-shaped imprint onto his mother’s fiat, pillows popping in response. The killer had flown beside the parked ambulances, lying docile on the floor.

By the time Jotaro had squeezed out the car, Koichi was knocked out. *The impact must’ve got him,* Jotaro thought, and propped him up against the car. He turned to his men, wounded more than he could’ve guessed. Okuyasu clutched onto his shoulder, a large gash splitting it almost in two- Rohan bore a bloodied lip and a black eye- Josuke clutched a bloody stump that was once his arm.

He shouted for the ambulance, and took Josuke’s hand. “You’re alright kid. You did well.”

He smirked and nodded dryly. *What a soldier.* Josuke beckoned him closer, and whispered in his ear-

“Kill- h-h-him. And quickly.”

“Will do.” He looked at Rohan. “If either of them die, I’m personally blaming you.”

“Sure,” he said breathlessly. “Should I call Joseph?”

“Nah. I got this.” Jotaro rose, and strutted over to a prostrate Kira, before a nurse rushed over to him.

“MISS, NO!” he yelled, but it was too late. Kira had touched her fingernail. *She’s a hostage.*

He crawled up her back, placing his bloodied hands over her body and her mouth, sliding his fingers over hers. Before anyone could say anything, the killer spoke.

“No one move. This woman is a hostage. Mr Kujo here can testify.” The nurse whimpered and tried to move, but he held her in place, pushing himself behind her back.

He nodded his head sternly. “If you put her down, I’ll kill you quickly.”

“No can do. You see, in about six minutes, you’ll all die and I’ll be back in front of the mirror, at 7:24. Unless, you can take this innocent life.”

Jotaro fingered the bullets in his pocket. *I swore, I cannot. The World could solve this. My Star Platinum could solve this. But can I even do it if I tried?*

“My lady,” he addressed the nurse, “has anyone ever told you that you have lovely hands?”

She whimpered again. “I asked you a question.” he said, less nicely.

“No, sir.” She managed to say between tears.

“Oh, what a shame.” He carried his hand from her face down her body. “They truly are lovely. So soft and smooth and neat.” His fingers danced over hers. “You know whose hands you have?” *This greasy bastard.*

“No?”

“The Mona Lisa.” He moaned loudly. “Oh, when I was but a boy, in my art class, I stumbled upon a picture of her. So beautiful. So tidy. So, well, *ambiguous.*” His voice shook. “It was my first, well, to be crude- *expierience*. Oh, and was it wonderful.”

*4 minutes left. He’s one good time waster.* Jotaro found himself unable to move- frozen in fear. Dio would stalk his nightmares, but even if his Star Platinum could shoot Kira, he would certainly kill this poor nurse. *The World is the only solution. A solution I cannot enact.*

“What’s your name, lovely?” he asked. She sniffled. He didn’t like that. 

“I SAID WHAT’S YOUR NAME?!” he yelled, and she cried. 

“Whisper it to me.”

Through tears, she whispered it into his ear. He smirked while she did, his eyes rolled back into his head. *The sick fuck. Damnit Jotaro, just kill him! I’ve got two minutes left to do it.* Jotaro picked up the bullet. *I’ll have to risk it. The World- I can’t.* He was disgusted in himself.

“What a- gorgeous name! When this time loop ends, perhaps I’ll pay you a visit. Would you like that?”

“V-v-vv very much so, sir.”

“Thank you. You can call me Yoshikage. If I can play with your hands, of course.”

“ACT 3, THREE FREEZE!” Koichi yelled, Kira’s hand slamming down as if a huge weight had been placed upon it. It cracked into the floor, while his other hand stayed lingering on her hand.

*40 seconds.* “Mr Hirose. Brave.” He smirked, blood dripping through his teeth. No one daredn’t move.

*30 seconds. Make a move Jotaro.* He placed the bullet in the palm of his hand, sweat dripping down his arm.

*25 seconds.* “But foolish. I’ve got two hands, y’know. And you’ve only got twenty seconds.”

A bullet slammed between Kira’s eyes, cocking it back like a lever. The nurse quickly scrambled away, while he laid there for a few more seconds. Jotaro breathed. *Okay. I did it. The World wasn’t needed.*

*15 seconds.* He lied.

*10 seconds.* He lied.

*7 seconds.* He lied.

*5 seconds.* “JOTARO KUJO!” Kira raised his thumb in a clicking motion while blood dripped down his head. When *his thumb touches his finger, that girl will die.* Jotaro understood what he had to do.

*Fine.*

“STAR PLATINUM, THE WORLD!” he yelled, and time was frozen.

It was always a strange sensation, moving through a world without time. Of course, nothing moved, but things like the sun and the wind and the tiny bugs nestled between the grass stood so oddly still. It was unnatural. It was the most unnatural feeling humans could attain. And Jotaro certainly wasn’t a fan.

*5 seconds in time freeze. Five seconds till he reverses back. If I land a hit, it’d have to be a good one. And it will be. In my domain, Yoshikage Kira is just a man.*

Jotaro threw one punch. Time returned.

Faster than a bullet, Kira shot through an ambulance and through another one, smashing into a car window and snapped his neck on the headrest. He raised his jagged head for a moment, touched his face and collapsed.

9:24 arrived. Jotaro felt his feet on the ground, and sighed. *Another one bites the dust.*

1p6kork,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1p6kork/quince_expands_into_gourmet_food_wines_with/,Quince Expands Into Gourmet Food & Wines With Premium Holiday Offerings,"[Quince ](https://go.shopmy.us/p-32784729)is moving beyond apparel and home goods with the launch of Gourmet Food & Wines, a new marketplace focused on high-end culinary items at what the brand positions as “radically fair prices.” The category debuts with products like Dom Pérignon, Italian White Alba truffles, and other luxury pantry staples curated for gifting and entertaining.

The move builds on consumer behavior Quince has already seen — shoppers looking for premium goods at accessible price points. The first test in this category, an exclusive caviar drop, sold out immediately. The company believes wine, truffles, oils, salts, and future expansions into single-origin teas, coffees, and Italian olive oils will strengthen its reputation as a full lifestyle destination.

Key early highlights include:

* Dom Pérignon offered at $259.99
* White Alba truffles priced at $250 per ounce
* Upcoming additions like black winter truffles and truffle-infused products
* Plans for expanded direct-import winery partnerships

Quince says the new offering extends its modern-luxury positioning from wardrobe and home “to the table,” reinforcing a strategy centered on quality, transparency, and direct partnerships with producers.

The expansion continues Quince’s push to challenge the idea that high-quality goods must come with steep markups — now across apparel, home, jewelry, travel, and premium food.

Does expanding into luxury food and wine strengthen Quince as a lifestyle brand, or does it risk stretching the identity that originally made it appealing?

1p6ko9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMLCompliance/comments/1p6ko9u/golden_revive_reviews_2025_update_shocking/,Golden Revive Reviews (2025 Update) – Shocking Complaints & Side Effects After 6 month,"# I Thought This Was Just For Seniors - Then Golden Revive Changed My Entire View on Aging

I'll be honest - when my 72-year-old mom first told me about Golden Revive, I rolled my eyes. ""Another supplement?"" I thought. But then I saw her tending her garden with the energy she had a decade ago, and I had to ask her secret. She handed me a bottle of Golden Revive and said, ""Just try it for a month.""

I'm 48, and I thought joint stiffness and that afternoon energy crash were just part of getting older. After three weeks of Golden Revive, I'm reconsidering everything I thought about aging.

This isn't just another supplement - it's like someone hit the reset button on my energy levels and joint comfort. I started noticing little things first - bending down to tie my shoes without groaning, keeping up with my teenagers on weekend hikes, actually having energy after work to do something besides collapse on the couch.

I asked around at my book club and yoga studio, and the stories were surprisingly consistent:

""I'm 58 and teach kindergarten. I was considering early retirement because I was so exhausted every day. Golden Revive gave me back the energy to keep doing what I love."" - Susan, elementary teacher

""My husband and I both started taking it. At 65, we're planning our first European backpacking trip - something we haven't done since our 20s."" - Robert, retired engineer

# What Real People Are Saying About Golden Revive

After talking to other users across different age groups, here's what stands out:

**What People Keep Mentioning:**  
• ""The morning stiffness in my hands is completely gone""  
• ""I actually wake up feeling refreshed for the first time in years""  
• ""My mental clarity has improved - no more 'brain fog'""  
• ""I can play with my grandkids without needing to sit down every five minutes""

**The Reality Check:**  
• ""It took about three weeks to really notice the difference""  
• ""The capsules are a bit large, but easy to swallow with water""  
• ""It's an investment, but cheaper than my daily coffee habit""

# Real Stories From Golden Revive Users

My neighbor, a 55-year-old marathon runner, shared: ""I was about to give up running because of joint pain. Golden Revive let me train for my tenth marathon pain-free. I'm telling all my running buddies about it.""

My 60-year-old coworker mentioned: ""I used to struggle to stay alert during afternoon meetings. Now I'm the one keeping the energy up in the room. People keep asking what changed.""

# What You Should Know

**Consistency is key:** This isn't an instant fix. I started noticing small changes in the first week, but the real transformation happened around week three.

**It works gradually:** The improvements sneak up on you. One day you realize you took the stairs without thinking about it, or you've been gardening for two hours without needing to rest.

**The mental benefits surprised me:** I didn't expect the brain fog to lift, but now I feel sharper and more focused throughout the day.

# The Honest Truth

I started taking Golden Revive skeptically, but now I understand why my mom was so enthusiastic. It's not about turning back the clock - it's about enjoying the age you are to the fullest.

**Quick note:** I'll drop the link to the official site in the comments so you can get the authentic formula with the money-back guarantee. I've heard the ingredients in the real version are much higher quality than what you might find elsewhere.

Has anyone else found products that genuinely improved your quality of life as you age? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments",0,1764096247.0,AMLCompliance,0,0.33,False

Last year I was obsessed with building the ""perfect"" tech stack for our startup. Spent weeks integrating tools, analyzing data, optimizing funnels. Meanwhile, our growth? Flat. Then my co-founder suggested something that sounded...dumb. QR codes. I literally laughed. ""Dude, it's 2024, not 2020."" But we were desperate, so whatever. We printed cheap stickers with QR codes and stuck them in coffee shops near our target customers. Each code linked to a simple signup page. Here's where it got interesting. We used qr, which lets you change where the code goes without reprinting anything. So Monday, it showed our free trial. Wednesday, a demo video. Friday, a special discount. Same sticker, different offers. Results? In three weeks, 600 people scanned it. 150 signed up. 35 became paying customers. Total cost? About $50 for stickers. Compare that to our Facebook ads-$2K spent, maybe 10 conversions. The analytics even showed us which coffee shops worked best, what time people scanned most, which offers converted. It was like having a focus group running 24/7. Bottom line: sometimes the simplest solution beats the fanciest one. We stopped overthinking and started actually talking to customers where they hang out. Anyone else finding that less tech=more results?",10,1764096246.0,startups,14,0.86,False
1p6knus,https://www.reddit.com/r/losslessscaling/comments/1p6knus/solved_dual_gpu_lossless_scaling_black_screen/,"[SOLVED] Dual GPU Lossless Scaling ""black screen""","Hi!

Recently I had problems with my dual gpu setup, that is now fixed. This is my setup:  
  
*- LG C5 42 OLED (4K, HDR, VRR 120/144Hz, 0.1ms MPRT, G-Sync/FreeSync Premium)*  
*- Intel Core i9-9900K ""Coffee Lake Refresh"" 8-Core, 16-Thread, OC at 5.0 GHz*  
*- Corsair Hydro Series H115i PRO RGB 280mm Liquid CPU Cooler*  
*- ASUS ROG Maximus XI Hero (Wi-Fi) - Intel® Z390 Chipset*  
*- 32GB (4x8) G.SKILL Trident Z RGB DDR4-3200Mhz*  
*- MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti VENTUS 3X 12G OC - 12GB GDDR6X (34.71 TFLOPS) - SLI\_01 (render game)*  
*- ASRock AMD Radeon RX 6600 Challenger D - 8GB GDDR6 (8.928 TFLOPS) - SLI\_02 (LSFG-Lossless Scaling Frame Generation)*  
*- Corsair RM750x 80 Plus Gold Fully Modular PSU*  
*- NZXT H500 ATX*  
*- Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 25H2 (64-bit)* 

The problem I had was, after installing everything correctly, when connecting my monitor to the RX 6600 (the GPU that performs LSFG is the GPU that needs to be connected to the monitor), even after starting Windows 11, after 5-10 seconds the screen would go black. After that, I would restart the PC and the RX 6600 would no longer be detected by the system; I had to use DDU to uninstall the drivers and only then reinstall them for the GPU to be detected again.  
  
After a week of discussing ideas with my friend ""chatgpt"", I came to the conclusion that even telling Windows 11 that my RTX 3080Ti was my ""default high-performance GPU"" when connecting the screen to my RX 6600, Windows 11 interpreted it as a bug and the screen would go black (if I disconnected the HDMI cable from the RX 6600 to connect the RTX 3080 Ti, the PC would be in the Windows 11 desktop environment).  
  
My next step would be to enter the BIOS of my motherboard (ASUS ROG Maximus XI Hero (Wi-Fi) - Intel® Z390 Chipset) and specify that the RX 6600 was the GPU connected to the monitor to avoid this bug, but my motherboard didn't have that option. What I did was simply change the order of the GPUs physically on the motherboard, since I couldn't change it in the BIOS!  
  
from  
\- PCIE1: RTX 3080 Ti (running on PCIe) 3.0 x8)  
\- PCIE2: RX 6600 (running on PCIe 3.0 x8)  
to  
\- PCIE1: RX 6600 (running on PCIe 3.0 x8)  
\- PCIE2: RTX 3080 Ti (running on PCIe 3.0 x8)  
  
This way I solved all my problems and I still have access to Freesync Premium through the connection of the LG C5 OLED to the RX6600. I can run Battlefield 6 on ""OVERKILL"" settings at 144fps, which is the maximum refresh rate of my LG C5 OLED

But have a pico so lemme tried the ‘soup’ thing. Primarily a v60 with the occasional pico shot (hate grinding manually and if too tight grind again etc). Recipes call for a coarser grind, no intense pre heat. Its night and i had some of my wife’s supermarket ground decaf. …. 18g in, bout 54 out. Pulled a soup and it tasted errrm….Decent. Like decent to good. Like not supposed to taste that good considering the raw material. Pulled a second 15g to 45g and it was just as good. This is driving me nuts as it goes against everything ive come to snob around coffee. 
Going to try with my fresh roasted beans tomorrow (medium to lightish roast). Im gonna rethink coffee if that tastes good. 

I was actually adding a stand, the gauge, the sleeves to my basket as my xmas gift. I dont need those anymore. 

Wanted to buy an electric grinder because im just tired of grinding (1zpresso xpro) even for pourover. I dont need too. Just get my roaster to grind a batch like their regular pre ground. Toss it in and ive got coffee in less than 3mins (prep while water boils). 

Workflow is so much easier. Dont even need to exert myself too much pumping for espresso and holding a super hot pico because i preheat the crap out of it. 

Im confused. Im happily confused.

I'd prefer f (which ill explain why), but m's by all means.","TLDR: i want a friend who i can just talk to, who wont judge me for just hitting them up and talking about something that happened in my day. or judge me when i talk about my hobbies.

i made the mistake of being my ex's caretaker for like 4 years. she was going through a hard time and i thought i could ""fix"" her, little naive me didn't know how terrible of an idea that was. being her ""everything"" and her being mine and then our eventual fallout made me crash. its been a year since we broke up and only now is all of that catching up to me.

now the reason i prefer f is because ive pretty much been raised by women: my 3 older sisters, my mom, 9 aunts, and the only cousins my age were also women. so my whole life i've gotten along better with women than men.

i miss being able to talk about my feelings in all honesty. its weird, i have a lot of people around me but i would never pick to open up to any of them. it just feels pointless or like im fishing for attention, or rather thats what i feel they'd think. i also just wanna be able to talk about my day or have someone to ""put on"" as the kids say these days. also just want someone to call me stupid when i do, say, or think something stupid

about myself real quick. my hobbies are: trying new types of coffee mixes, creative writing, diy crafts, (just started) reading, collecting different fidget toys. also spend a lot of time gaming (trying to reduce that tho XD).

Buckle up for the lore and context. I type a lot, and I also want to make sure I include every necessary detail about our relationship so that judgement is accurate. Luckily for you guys, we were only together for about 7 months. 

I met this guy (20) in a coffee shop through a mutual friend in April of this year, like straight out of a movie. We swapped numbers quite literally before I knew we were swapping numbers— we have iPhones and he did the thing where he tapped his phone to mine the second he got close enough— just kinda grabbed my phone and did it. Then I had to leave earlier than him and our friend, so I caught my ride and went home, settled in when I got home, and within not even a minute of sitting on the living room sofa, I have a message from him. We’re both super awkward and didn’t know how to talk to each other, just that we wanted to do so because we liked each other’s vibes. He uses custom stickers instead of emojis, and I thought that was cool and didn’t know how to do it, so I asked how. He made this an excuse to get me alone, offering to hang out soon and show me how. I accepted. I knew this was out of interest in me— nobody has to do all that. Just send me whatever you Googled to figure it out… but I accepted nonetheless.
I didn’t really want this to be a date or for him to be interested, but I really wanted another friend. I just had a falling out with a friend group that I’d known since middle and high school. Above all, I’ve been in some seriously messed up relationships. Exes have done pretty much everything that you think an evil ex would do except for physically beat me. It’s broken me down to a point of being really bad with setting boundaries for the sake of other people and keeping them comfortable, even if it meant that they were comfortable with making me uncomfortable. That’s unfortunately where the trouble in this story starts. It’s really hard for me to trust potential partners, and I don’t even trust the partner I currently had (still have) that he was made VERY aware of (thanks to me trying to be cautious and prevent it from being a date, I told them that I was in a mindfucky long distance relationship— which was true. I’m not particularly happy with him and he’s been treating me like shit for three years and counting while promising to change and begging me not to leave or he’ll kill himself), but we hang out, and he’s got this wide, toothy grin that’s happy to see me and these eyes that were dull otherwise, but lit up when they looked into mine. And he starts telling me things that other people don’t know, and he’s sitting across from me looking like he’s waiting to wrap his arms around me at any second, and he’s leaning in with this same smile, and he’s just so… genuine. Couldn’t deny either that this guy was incredibly cute. It’s hard for me not to fall, despite previously begging myself to not even take the invite because he was definitely flirting with me. Pretty soon, we’re making out in his car, and I do something I thought I’d NEVER do “on the first date”, and then we both have a curfew to make, and he drives me home with one hand on the steering wheel and the other tightly wrapped around mine. 

We move so quickly that we forgot to put an official label on it— I guess you’d call that a situationship. We were on fire within a week. He also revealed that he going into the military soon, and I hated everything about that, but tried to stay optimistic because in a weird way, I’d never been happier with someone. I was okay with keeping things unlabeled, given my situation (and the fact that my boyfriend actually wouldn’t mind me doing things with other people as long as there’s no committed relationship— that is something we have specifically spoken about and it’s a weird thing he’s into) and I figured with the military and all, we’d have plenty of time to figure it out, or maybe it would fizzle out like everything else does and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. We never talked about it until one day he got pissed at me— and I guess this is the part where I reveal that we’re both bi. Pretty early on, I wanna say within two or three weeks, I went with a group of friends to a strip club that has a no phones rule. Guy had no problem with it and told me to have fun. My friend bought me a lap dance, and the dancer offered to let me touch her, so I did, despite my very awkward nature. Very drunk and talkative as I am when such, as soon as I’m out of the club, I’m yapping to the guy about me and my friend group’s conversations and shenanigans, and when I mention the lap dance, he’s cold all of a sudden to a point where my friends look at me looking at my phone all scared and notice how pale and shakey I am and ask me what’s wrong. He tells me that he wishes I would have told him or asked about it first. I explained the no phones rule and that it all happened really fast, and that I was just kind of offered not only what took place, but the getting the dance itself all within like 20 seconds, but I didn’t address the elephant in the room that my friends were very fast to remind me of when I filled them on the situation: He’s not my boyfriend. And my ACTUAL boyfriend has expressed being okay with this kind of stuff. Me and this guy never talked about labels, but he was already acting like I was property. But he also explained to me before that jealousy was his biggest red flag— I called it my bad and insisted I could handle jealousy— after all, I myself can get SICKENINGLY jealous to almost an ugly extent. I decided to be understanding, apologize as extensively as I could, and tried to move on.

Things were back to normal after that, except for the fact that I was now apparently his girlfriend. I reminded myself, and friends also reminded me that he knew about my other boyfriend. If he had a complaint, he could file it with the guy that made himself my new one. 
So we were going on all these cute dates for the next couple months until he left for boot camp in July. He showered me with love, attention, and gifts/spending money on me (this part I specifically was against— I’ve never been one to feel happy to be spoiled— I feel more like a financial burden than anything when someone loans me even like 5$). He blows up my phone to a point of it being almost annoying… almost. I couldn’t help but find him irresistible despite him claiming to be a “recovering asshole” (but never telling me about his asshole past while expecting me to open up about mine and getting annoyed when I wouldn’t) 

While he was gone, I thought harder about our “relationship” and some conversations we’d had before. First off, his dad is ex military, extremely conservative and Christian, and overly judgy of every girl he’s ever brought home. His gay sisters were like him and atheist lefties, but also still judgy about his partners. I was evidently the first partner that his sisters liked. I stayed a secret to his dad and stepmom, and his real mom was the family demon that apparently no one liked to talk about. I wondered how I would fit into all this with me looking VISIBLY queer, witchy, and into subculture that his parents would consider devil worship. He also mentioned that if I ever met his dad, the first word to fall out of his dad’s mouth would be “Fat.” (this boy is exactly what you picture when you think of a default twink and his dad is just the older balder version). His dad would also hear that I’m autistic and suddenly view me as a mentally incompetent child. I thought about this particularly hard because second, he brought up marriage and having kids a lot, not like it was an if, but a when. We had been together for only 3 months, and I didn’t even know we were for a few weeks, and once again, he KNEW I was in another relationship that kept me stressing out with my hands full. I wasn’t even worried about both dynamics becoming long distance, though. Long distance was my ideal relationship for a while due to my trust issues. It sucks to miss him, though. I send him Snapchat videos to watch and stay updated on my yappenings when he gets his phone back and starts staying in the barracks and going to school.

After he gets his phone back some point in August, I don’t hear much. He wasn’t super chatty before, but it got worse. At first, I assume he’s really busy. When I hear from him, I bring that up and he says “not really, I’ve been sitting around A LOT”. And I’m like… ouch… you know? But I dismiss it. It’s still new for the both of us. I try to give us a little time to adjust. By September, I’m making some accomplishments in terms of my little theatre hobby that I’m really excited to tell him about. He halfheartedly shares my enthusiasm. His birthday is a week before mine, and I wish him a happy birthday and he thanks me. My birthday comes around the following week and he texts me for most of the day, but it’s like 10:30 pm before he addresses the elephant in the room with a “you having a good birthday?”… not “happy birthday”. I then proceeded to tell him that I am, despite my ex that I have expressed that I don’t want contacting me doing so anyway to wish me a happy birthday and saying that I don’t need to respond and that he’s just wishing me well but sent me a message melting down 5 minutes later because I didn’t answer. It felt good me like a guy that I expressed not wanting to see or hear from again seemingly wanted more to do with me than my own “boyfriend”. I shrugged it off and didn’t say anything. I kept drinking with my friends, which included the aforementioned ex’s parents. That part isn’t important to the story, I just found it funny and hoped someone else would.

A show day at one of the theaters I work at comes up for me later that month and it’s really important to me, but it’s also his first day completely free of work or school and being able to leave the barracks. Despite us both being busy, we express wanting to talk to each other for a chunk of that day, even if it’s while we’re in the middle of something. A little’s better than nothing. But I wait by the phone and barely hear from him all day. I even waited long enough to skip last minute set building and show up a little later than call time because I’ve never before and I’m established with the director enough for it to not be a huge deal— other people less established than me have done it without consequence. And then I heard from him during the few evening hours that I specifically told him that I WOULDN’T have my phone on me. That irked me enough to actually say something, and I basically expressed my annoyance that he picked the literal busiest and worst time when we both had free time for the entire day beforehand and then some when I made myself late hoping to hear from him. I was just met with “sorry”, and it made me think of how when I said sorry for the great Strip Club Miscommunication Meltdown of April and a few smaller instances after, he wouldn’t take it and I had to practically state my defense like I was on trial in order for him to believe that I was sorry. If I didn’t have a full explanation for my actions and a speech on how I now see the error of my ways, it didn’t seem to mean anything to him. So I thought to myself “where’s my grand apology?” or “when does he start begging for forgiveness?”. That never happened.

The next two months leading up to the past weekend are full of arguments on the rare times I hear more than a few words from him. 

Our first big one is after what I just described. I had asked for better communication so that I would know when would and wouldn’t be a good time to try to talk to him, and didn’t get anything. And he would text me first only to be incredibly short like he didn’t start the conversation. One day I just kind of snapped and asked for literally anything because he wouldn’t even tell me how he or his day was and actively avoided the question. And then it spiraled into an argument where he wanted to leave me. I asked why. He brought up the devil that no one dared to speak about and said that I was going to end up not loving him anymore and leaving— like his mom did to his dad. I assured I wasn’t going anywhere and wanted to see this through and I didn’t care what he or we went through— I was here to stay. And I thought he believed me, because he decided to stay. And then communication got better for a day or two before it went back to the way it was.

Over time, my discontent with his choice to join the military becomes more apparent. During arguments, I would mention how given both of our political views, now is literally the worst time to join, and how it’s a bad choice anyway because of how exploitative it inherently is, how I hoped he’d known it, and I would question if his dad pressured him into it because I thought he’d be smarter than this. He told me his dad actually asked if he was sure about joining and that he was. He told me that he was out of options and didn’t wanna stay a cashier and wanted to be able to pay for school. He acted like he was fucking drafted and didn’t ask me if it was okay that he was going into the navy and wasn’t met with a shaky and hesitant thumbs up. I said there were other ways to live comfortably without whoring yourself out to Uncle Sam and coming back with your head more messed up than he found it. He didn’t appreciate anything I said, but I felt like it was the truth. There were times that I could have not borderline if not actually phrased these things as insults, but I was also just tired of letting things slide when he’d never let me live things down. I’ll admit I shouldn’t have been insulting, but I’ll also defend myself with “you can’t blame a girl for getting fed the fuck up”. I mean, in my eyes, he was the one made this bed and then complained that he had to share it with a bunch of other guys and live under stupid and excessive rules. I suggested a few times “hey you might not be feeling like yourself lately because of the environment change” and that was denied despite me continuously hearing complaints, so yeah, I got a little aggressive with it. Maybe too aggressive, but oh well, thanks Captain Hindsight. 

I also just didn’t like his dad based on everything he’d told me about him. I mean the mere mention of this guy felt like a threat to me. Can you blame me? The two times he brought up his dad during this time that sparked WW3 and 4 was when he sent me a meme saying “my dad sent me this”, and the meme looked like propaganda that was ripped straight from the 1950s and said “Careful, sailor! She might be a liberal, and liberals carry VD!”… I want someone to tell me how I was supposed to respond to that. Like: “Hey, my dad basically just told me that he thinks my girlfriend that he doesn’t know exists is a whore”. How does the alleged whore respond? Naturally, I just kinda responded with “oh that’s nice”. But then later snapped and asked the same question that I asked you all: “How the FUCK am I supposed to feel and respond to that?”. Part of me hoped he’d man up and stick up for me, or any woman and say “hey dad, that’s not cool” but I knew that I was staying secret AND he’d never speak against that man. And I once again wondered how the hell this could ever work the way that he said it wanted to. But he told me it would and that we would figure it out. 
And then another time was when he told me he was feeling off and I asked if there was anyone he could talk to since he refused to talk to me about his feelings. I inferred that he was struggling with juggling both his job and our relationship since he hasn’t had the best past experiences in love either, and so I suggested that maybe he ask someone for advice. He told me he only trusted his sisters and dad who can’t know I exist for advice, and I quipped “I don’t think I’d trust the guy who hates me for existing”. Again, maybe not necessary for me to say, but I’ll forever ask why the HELL he sings the praises of that immature, insecure, bigot. He’s allowed to love him. My mom is all three of those things and I still love her, but I am definitely not the first to run to her defense if she says or does something fucked up, especially if one of those things hurt someone I claim to love. 
But then he says it… he brings up the devil again— “because you’d remind him of my mom”. 
At this point, I’m tired of being compared to the woman that he and everyone hates for what feels like giving too much of a shit about this guy’s well being. I start to take it personally, and I call it out. And honestly, I don’t even remember what was said after that. But I do know that I just tucked tail by the end and gave another grand apology speech like I always did. And like always, he told me it was fine, and then we waited for the next incident while we pretended problems weren’t lingering. I didn’t want to pretend, I always asked what was wrong. He would never answer. Asking about his mood or the state of our relationship was the quickest way to end a conversation, but it was hard for me to just not bring it up. Obviously I care, but it feels like for some reason, I’m not allowed to. But he always begged me to let him in on my moods. Always asked for every story that he later complained that he had to listen to. 

Our last big argument came after he had been acting incredibly off for a while, and expressed that he got into drinking. Mind you all, he had the opportunity to in the past but didn’t, claimed it wasn’t for him, and even got onto me at times for drinking or smoking too much weed. He wouldn’t even hang out in a bar with me, even if I was sober. So, him drinking all of a sudden and making it his personality was how I knew something was wrong. I would ask all the time what was wrong, how he was, how his day was, how he was feeling, and was met with the same avoidant answers. I gently asked, almost pleaded with him, “why won’t you ever answer the most basic question that nearly any average conversation starts with?” I opened up and said “because it makes it really hard to have a conversation with you when you shut it down in the very beginning when you’re the one that started it”, and then my heart sank and I added “and lately you haven’t been saying you love me back when I wish you goodnight…” and he just says “when you say you love me it feels like you’re stabbing me in the chest and so I don’t say it back because it feels like I’m doing the same to you”… at that point, I’m shattered… again, how does one respond to that? I say I’ll give them space, and apologize. I say that I’ll wait for him to speak first when he’s ready, which I always do anyway, but this time, I verbalize that this is my plan… And then he messages me the next day like nothing’s wrong. And it’s almost like the old him is back. He even says he loves me too. And I can’t lie, the sudden switch is eerie. I express that, and ask what gives. They say that they’re suddenly just feeling better. I’m stunned. What changed overnight? I didn’t trust it. I couldn’t. I prod, I also say that they’re don’t have to say it back, and when they ask why I seem so upset and worried, I say “well, you compared me to someone you hate multiple times and just equated me telling you I love you to literal murder not even 24 hours ago, sorry for being confused and it now being weird for me to hear you to say it back”. And then he snaps and says “well you won’t have to hear it again”. I freak out and get all apologetic, and he wants to talk about it later like always, and I let it go for him no matter how mindfucked I am. 

The next day, he tells me that he tried to make things better and that I just wouldn’t have it. I went through everything I just went through with you all with him and asked what more could I do for him other than change everything about myself and just not feel how I feel. He said there was nothing I could do and long story short dumped me after many other things he said, including the fact that I’M apparently why he started drinking, not the military. And it’s also revealed that he started falling out of love with me. And now he’s mad that I felt betrayed for being told everything was fine while he was plotting some kind of escape as if I was holding him captive— like he didn’t drag me into this in the first place. 

There’s more to the story post-breakup, but that’s the basis.
I’ve been made to feel like the villain by him, but my friends tell me a different story. They say I was lovebombed, manipulated, etc… and I don’t want to believe it because I’ve been down that road so many times and he convinced me he wasn’t like that and that I was finally safe with someone and allowed to be happy in a relationship. 

Am I the asshole in this breakup? 
I know there’s inherent assholery in not being happy with the first boyfriend and letting myself get roped into a relationship with Captain Save A Hoe instead of just leaving, but I’m trying to work through it. It’s a very complex situation that’s for a separate post. I just need to know if I’m the villain that this military guy is making me out to be.

1p6kk84,https://i.redd.it/105u17337g3g1.jpeg,Castenada (Part 32),"*Dream-Talker Ritual, 1984, by Amaya Mitchell.*

In high school I was spending more time at the movies than anywhere else. There was a six-plex out on West 11th called Movieland. I learned the ushers’ rounds and the sweet spot to slide into a row without getting the flashlight. The first movie I snuck into was *Alien*. I bought a showing for *The In-Laws* and ducked into the next auditorium when the trailers started. And let me tell you, I *loved* it. People were practically biting their nails. Hell, I had to walk the length of the lot afterwards to collect myself. I knew at that point that I wanted to create something very similar and tell stories of my own.

After that I started sneaking into showings whenever I could. I brought a little spiral notebook and, when the exit sign was bright enough, I’d scribble notes. I probably looked ridiculous. I didn’t have a camera at that age, so I borrowed one. Our neighbor had a Super 8 he kept in a shoebox. I saved up money from bagging groceries and bought fresh stock at the drugstore when I could. I didn’t really make anything substantial, but it was enough to get my foot in the door.

I stayed in Eugene for school at the University of Oregon and landed in Telecommunication and Film. Most of the day, we were in Allen Hall. At night, we watched whatever we could. The Cultural Forum would throw films in the Redwood Auditorium, and you could sit on the floor if the seats filled. When they didn’t have something on, we walked to the Bijou on 13th. One time, they were playing this really goofy film called *Evelien*. We got a good laugh out of that one.

Somewhere in there I decided I had to make something of my own. I worked up the nerve to ask Lena from my media studies class if she’d be in it. We’d talked only once or twice, and I figured she’d say no. She said, “Only if it’s not weird,” which I promised it wouldn’t be, and then immediately worried I’d lied.

I shot it with whatever friends would agree to help on weekends with a rented CP-16. We blacked out my apartment with trash bags and spring clamps and stole a clamp light from the cage that was missing a scrim. It ended up around twenty minutes long, an experimental horror film I called Blue Empire. I was very overtly inspired by Jean Cocteau’s *Orphic Trilogy* and Ingmar Bergman’s *Hour of the Wolf*. There wasn’t really a plot, not in any traditional sense. It was mostly imagery and dream-logic. Lena was great at not overselling her delivery, but the friends I had play the other roles were incredibly amateur. I really wanted to say something, but it’s really hard to direct people you consider your peers.

I was embarrassed as soon as I watched the rough cut. The lighting was fine and the shots mostly held, but the acting was atrocious and wasn’t what I was going for at all. I mean, that’s what you get when you ask for volunteers. I lied and told the class I’d had a transfer issue and skipped my slot in Redwood. The only person I was honest with was Lena. We met at Glenwood after lab to grab coffee. “It’s not that bad, Chuck.” Which somehow made it worse.

I put the master in a cracked clamshell and slid it across to her. “You keep it,” I said. “I don’t really want to be reminded of it. I trust you’ll take good care of it.” I never really saw Lena again after we graduated. I had unfortunately come to find out five years later that she and her family passed away in a very tragic house fire. I assumed the film along with them. I regretted not going to her celebration of life.

After school, I shopped myself around town, hitting every local affiliate I could think of. The story was always the same: “We’re really just hiring people with experience right now.” I sent tapes out to Portland, Seattle, a public access station in the Bay Area. Nothing. In between, I picked up whatever shifts I could. I went back to bagging groceries for a while. I’d come home dead on my feet and tell myself I’d write something on my nights off, but then the nights off would come and I’d sit there, staring at the blank page, suddenly convinced I had nothing worth writing or pointing a camera at. And then the years flew by and I was already in my thirties.

One night, a friend dragged me out to Icky’s Tea House, on 3rd and Blair. Inside, it felt more like a repurposed shop floor than a club. Someone had carved out a stage against one wall, just a raised platform of lumber and sheets of plywood, with black paint slapped over most of the visible surfaces. The rest of the room was folding chairs and mismatched couches. There was a punk show going that night. Not really sure who was playing. The floor in front of the stage churned with bodies. Kids flung themselves into each other and laughed and screamed. I wedged myself near the back wall, nursing a beer. Flyers were taped and stapled to every vertical surface. Somewhere in the middle of it, partly covered by a Jawbreaker flyer, was a quarter-sheet in plain black type:

*Wanted: Experience with film or ENG equipment.*

It was a flyer for a public broadcasting station called CPBC in Castenada. Mind you, I hadn’t heard of Castenada at this point. I tore one of the little tabs off the bottom of the flyer and stuck it in my wallet. I waited a day to call. Then another. Every time I reached for the phone, I’d hear all the old rejections again. Finally, one afternoon, I went down to the pay phone on the corner and dialed the number.

“CPBC,” a woman answered. Her voice sounded like she’d been smoking through most of the Reagan administration. I could hear a TV murmuring in the background, something game show-ish and faint.

“Hi. I’m calling about the flyer that said you were looking for someone with film experience?”

There was a pause long enough that I thought maybe I’d misdialed. “Please hold.”

I heard the receiver thunk down on a hard surface, then the muffled sound of her yelling for someone down a hallway. A door banged. A second later there was the squeak of a chair and a voice. “This is Chep. If you’re the fella with the water filter scam, save your breath. I already drink out of the tap and that’s probably what’s keeping me alive.”

“Uh, I’m not selling anything. I was calling about a flyer I saw in Eugene.”

“…which one? The dolphin one?”

“No. The job listing.”

There was a silence on his end for a moment. “Ah, okay. You ever use a camera before?”

“I did Telecommunication and Film at U of O. I’ve done some-”

“*Woah!* Hold the fuck up, College Boy! Tell me this in the interview. How’s steak and baked potato sound for dinner?” He rattled off directions that were more landmarks than anything. Two days later, I was white-knuckling my way up the highway. It took very little convincing to get hired on the spot.

How do I describe the two decades I spent working for Chep? He was like a sitcom character that had a twelve-year-old’s sense of humor and a ten-year-old’s attention span, and he never really tried to grow out of either. He had this weird, persistent obsession with the ocean too. It made a kind of crooked sense when I finally learned he was heir to the Montgomery family fortune. The only reason I could convince myself to stay for so long was because I wasn’t confident that I would be able to find work elsewhere that related to my coursework.

Leaving CPBC wasn’t some big dramatic exit so much as a slow realization that I’d let my life calcify around a job. The station changed. The gear got a little better, the budget a lot worse. We lost a couple of shows, picked up some syndicated filler to plug the gaps. The writing was on the wall, and when I found out a production house in Salem needed someone, I applied. When I told Chep, he told me that I “sold out to Big PowerPoint”, whatever that means.

After a few years at that job, I got a Facebook message from a name I didn’t recognize: Koji Nakamura. The profile picture was completely black with two human eyes peeking through. The text said:

*Hello Mr. Mahew. My name is Koji. I am Japanese video artist. I am very interested in your work. Could we meet to talk about collaboration? ^_^*

I stared at the message for a long time, trying to decide if it was a scam or just weirdly earnest. The profile didn’t help much. A couple of posts in Japanese, a few grainy photos. No friends. I wrote back:

*Hi Koji. What work are you referring to?*

He replied almost instantly, like he’d been sitting there waiting:

*Hello!! Thank you for answer. I have see your work many time. It is very important inspiration.*

I reiterated:

*I’ve worked on a few things over the years. Can you be more specific?*

There was a longer pause this time. The typing bubble popped up, vanished, and then came back:

*Is little difficult to explain in my English. Maybe we talk in person? I bring friend to translate <_<*

That set off every alarm bell I had. Some stranger with a blank profile, vague flattery, wants to meet in person to talk about mysterious “work”:

*No offense, but this is a little vague. How did you even find me?*

He wrote back:

*:) If you not comfortable, I understand. But I think you will be very interest! I am serious artist,*

He added a link to what I assumed was his website: a barebones page straight out of the 90s with a couple of indiscernible grainy images. The text was mostly Japanese. I went back and forth with myself for a day. On the one hand, everything about it felt off. On the other hand, I was bored at a job that mostly involved making corporate training videos. If some weirdo video artist wanted to buy me coffee, what was the harm?

We settled on meeting at a Starbucks. I gave him the date and time and, because I’m not completely reckless, told a coworker where I’d be and forwarded the message thread. When the day came around, I arrived there early and sat where I could see the door. Every time it opened and let in a gust of cold air, I half-hoped it was a no-show so I could go back to my carefully scheduled malaise. Instead, he walked in right on time.

He was younger than I’d pictured, mid-thirties maybe, but he carried himself like somebody older. Thin, almost fragile, in a dark coat that hung straight down from his shoulders like a curtain. Behind him was a fair-skinned woman that had on a green wool coat and her hair was pinned up in a loose knot that had already started to fall apart. “Mahew-san?”

I stood up to shake his hand. “Yeah. Chuck is fine though.”

“Ciao,” the woman said, sliding a third chair to the table. “I help… bridge the language.” She mimed a little arch with her hands.

“So,” I said, after we’d all settled. “You said you were interested in my work?”

The woman looked at Koji. He nodded for her to go first. “Your works are… very important influence for him. He watch many times.”

Koji leaned forward, elbows on the table. “Yes, many times. Long time.”

“What did you see? Like, where did you see it? Online? TV?”

He turned to the woman and rattled off something in rapid Japanese. She answered him in Italian.

“Broadcast? YouTube?” I offered.

The woman snapped her fingers. “Broadcast, yes. Maybe. He see… through friends, and… *eh…*” She looked back to Koji.

“Tape. Old tape.”

“Okay,” I said. “Old tape of… what, exactly?”

Another exchange in Japanese, then Italian. At one point I heard my own name and the English words “white boy” drop into the mix. “He will send materials,” she said. “Is… better you see before much more talking, he thinks.”

“Sure,” I said, even though every instinct told me I was signing up for something I didn’t quite understand. “Send it along.”

Koji pulled a little notebook from his coat pocket and wrote down my address in tiny, careful characters. The rest of the meeting was awkward as they mostly conversed outside of English for around fifteen minutes while occasionally roping me in to answer a few questions. When we shook hands at the end, for a second I had the strange, stupid feeling that he already knew exactly how I’d react to whatever he was about to mail me.

A week later, a padded envelope showed up in my mailbox with international postage. Inside was a single DVD-R in a cheap plastic sleeve, the surface labeled in thin black marker: *BLUE EMPIRE*. Seeing those words in his handwriting hit me harder than I expected. For a second, I just stood there in the kitchen staring at it. *How the hell did he get this?*

I pulled open a drawer and retrieved my external DVD drive. Upon plugging it into my laptop, the little light on the drive blinked an anemic green. I slid the disk into the tray and the file explorer popped up on the screen with the file “*BLUE_EMPIRE.mp4*” inside. I sat there with my finger hovering over the trackpad before eventually opening the file.

It was unmistakably mine. It opened exactly as I had remembered it: with Lena laying on my bed in that blue thrift-store dress, staring up at the ceiling. Watching it on my laptop now, decades later, I felt the same old crawl of embarrassment rise up, and then, underneath it, something else. Nostalgia, I guess. I could feel the whole apparatus of that time come back. Lena started walking toward the camera down that horrible narrow hallway in my old apartment, the overhead light flickering. Then the grief came in, right on top of that. She looked so young there. Younger than I’d let myself remember. Hair pulled back in that lazy way she had, some strands fallen out and clinging to her cheek. I felt my throat tighten. I had to pause it. I just sat there with the laptop screen frozen on her face while I got myself under control.

When I finally came to, I noticed something peculiar in the paused frame. Behind her, in the far left corner, was a block of murky gray compression that you get when you transfer old tape to digital. I leaned closer. Squinted. It looked vaguely like a person sitting there in the dark and staring. I couldn’t remember someone being in that corner that night. I hit play and paused again. The shape was still there, more defined now that I knew where to look. I fullscreened the video and I took a screenshot. In Photoshop, I bumped up the brightness and contrast but the shape was too blurry to make out. I sat back in my chair, suddenly aware of how quiet the apartment was. The only sound was the faint whir of the DVD drive.

My first impulse was to tab over to Facebook and fire off a message to Koji. When I clicked on his profile, the page gave me the gray, apologetic box: *This content isn’t available right now.* He had deleted his profile. The website link he’d sent me now led to a hosting error.

I closed the browser and went back to the media player. I hit play. For a while, despite the figure, it was exactly what I remembered. I started to relax into it the more I watched.

About ten minutes in, however, there was a hard cut where there shouldn’t have been one. It cut to Lena sitting on the edge of my unmade bed, facing away from the camera. She was still, almost catatonic, hunched over with her hands knotted in the fabric of the blue dress. She was sobbing. *What the fuck is this?*

She slowly turned towards the camera. There were wet tracks of tears on her cheeks. “Don’t-” she started, then the audio tore into a stripe of static. Her mouth kept moving under the noise and the sound snapped back with delay. “…let it in.” It was then that the person in the corner stood up.

They separated into a long, narrow column, glistening slightly under the low ceiling light. Bits of the shape were sloughing off. That was the only way I could process what I was seeing. Chunks, hunks, something, dropping from the surface in slow, obscene drips and hitting the carpet. The shape in the corner took on more definition as it leaned forward. A head, or something trying to be a head, began to resolve out of the dripping mess. As it turned, I caught the flash of teeth bared in what might have been a grimace.

I tried to pause the video file, but pressing the space key did nothing. Now the thing was at the side of the bed. Lena didn’t look at it. She was staring dead center into the lens. Tears tracked down her cheeks. For a heartbeat, it felt like we were looking directly at each other. I lurched forward and slammed the laptop shut with both hands. I then yanked the USB cable out and started beating the external DVD drive against the edge of the desk. By the third or fourth hit, the shell had split and it came apart into several pieces. I forcefully pulled the disc out and flexed it between my hands until it snapped.

I never heard from Koji again. I tried, for a while. He had moved on without leaving much of a footprint. I backed everything else up and I got rid of that laptop a few months later, just to be safe. I got out of production not long after that. Every now and then, though, in the dark, I’ll catch a shape in the corner of my eye in the doorway, or by the closet, or in the reflection of the TV when it’s off. But when I turn to look at it, there’s nothing there.

Whatever Koji wanted from me, or from that film, went wherever he went. I’ve made my peace with the idea that I’m never going to know how he got that tape, or what else he might have done with it, or if the version I watched that night was the only one. Most days, those questions stay buried under the ordinary weight of getting older.",1,1764095989.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I’ll be honest – as a parent, I’m always on the lookout for toys that are more than just screen-time distractions. I wanted something that would get my kids moving, spark their imagination, and (hopefully) not break after a week. That’s when we discovered the Space Fly Ball.

From the moment we turned it on, my living room transformed. The gentle, glowing orb floated through the air, weaving around furniture like something out of a sci-fi movie. My kids, who usually debate over what to watch, were instantly united in wonder—and then in play.

This isn’t just another flying toy. It’s a gentle, interactive experience that feels like having a friendly little UFO right in your home. It’s safe, easy to control, and encourages kids to run, jump, and play together in a whole new way.

Here’s what other parents are saying:

“My 7-year-old is usually pretty shy, but the Space Fly Ball got her laughing, running, and playing with her brother like I’ve never seen. It’s brought so much joy—and exercise—into our home.” — Lisa, mom of two

“We use it indoors on rainy days and outside when the weather’s nice. It’s durable, kid-safe, and the battery lasts through hours of play.” — Marcus, dad and part-time referee

# What Real Families Are Saying About Space Fly Ball

I asked around at school pick-up and in parenting groups. Here’s the real talk:

What Parents & Kids Love:

* It’s easy for kids to use—no complicated controls or apps required
* The soft, lightweight design is safe for indoor play (no broken lamps!)
* Automatic obstacle avoidance means less parent intervention
* It encourages active, imaginative play without a screen

Things to Keep in Mind:

* Works best in open spaces—clear the coffee table for best results!
* Not waterproof, so keep it away from pools or rain
* Younger kids might need help docking it back on the charger

# Real Stories from Real Families

One mom from my daughter’s soccer team told me: “We brought this to a birthday party, and it was a total hit. Kids of all ages were taking turns, making up games, and just having a blast.”

Another parent shared: “My son has sensory sensitivities, and the smooth, quiet movement of the Space Fly Ball is calming for him. It’s one of the few active toys he truly enjoys.”

# What You Should Know

It’s great for group play: Unlike some toys that cause arguments, this one seems to bring kids together. They invent games, take turns, and play as a team.

It grows with your kids: Whether your child is 5 or 12, the fun adapts. Younger kids chase it with pure delight, while older ones create obstacle courses and challenges.

It’s parent-approved: No loud noises, no small parts, and it’s sturdy enough to handle enthusiastic play.

# The Honest Truth

As a parent, it’s not always easy to find toys that are fun, active, and durable. The Space Fly Ball has been a win in our house—for my kids and for me. It gets them off the couch, fills the room with laughter, and gives all of us a little sense of wonder.

1p6kglo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/1p6kglo/amulet_its_time/,Amulet - It's Time.,"**BABY RAGE INCOMING**

*Context: I played in Vegas and got absolutely clowned on by amulet both matches I played against it. 0-4 in games and it never felt particularly close. I recognize its win rate was not stellar this weekend, and that my perspective should be taken with a grain of salt as I am... salty... about that experience. This is in spite of my opponents being cordial, concise, and pleasant people overall. Which we all know is not always the case.*

I agree that it was right not to ban anything on November 10th in modern as we were in the middle of the RC’s; However, with that in the rear view, I’d like to make my argument for some action to be taken against Amulet.

On a recent episode of the Unsleeved Podcast hosted by Patrick Sullivan and Chapin, Psully made this comment following the recent b&r update: 

*“... People play a lot of different decks, and anything you ban to me would suggest a we are striving for a play pattern target or a quality of gameplay target that they do not, nor can get to anyway. So at that point, I think modern should be sort of treated as if individual cards or decks are over represented, we are going to take action. But if it’s like, ‘oh Titan’s kind of horse shit, and it’s complicated and takes a long time.’ Maybe that was the bar ten years ago, that’s not the bar anymore.”*

I really hope that’s not true, because sitting down across from amulet has to be the least pleasant experience I've endured over the last 15 years playing this game. 

Round 1 I watched my opponent fuck about with a scapeshift on the stack for ~2 minutes while they figured out how to kill me that turn because I exiled a tolaria west with a ragavan attack. Then  I got to watch them execute the combo which took another 10ish minutes while I enjoyed my coffee.At some point they tried to play 2 lands in one turn in this process, which I caught fortunately. I don’t think they were trying to cheat me, but mistakes are bound to happen when shit gets this complicated. 

Having to sit there and vaguely understand what's happening to keep my opponent honest sucks. Every question I ask or try to clarify just makes it take longer, and while it can be deterministic, it's fuckupable. A highly skilled amulet practitioner by the name of Collins Mullen openly admitted to accidentally killing themselves one game against Reid Duke in the final round of the pro tour. He ended up winning the match, but in these comp REL events you're pissing away equity if you just concede. Lame.

Some might argue that it’s idiotic to complain about titan rolling people when energy does the same thing game in and out while presenting 4 kills. You might be right. I agree that it can be frustrating to play against that deck as well, but at least there are a myriad of interaction points and they are literally unable to present a t2 kill. If amulet goes t1 amulet, t2 amulet + lotus field + payoff… You better have some hyper specific interaction or you’re dead.

----------

**So...**

If nothing else, lotus field must die. the inability to interact with it outside of consign and moon effects, which can be far too slow in the face of some of amulet’s better draws, is an obvious ban if they want to keep the deck around. It severely limits the analyst loops as well (i think), which are the most obnoxious part of the deck. Banning analyst alone would result in it being replaced by Lumra, and little would change.

However, as someone who was just turn 3'ed in back to back games when am amulet never entered the battlefield... Amulet could go. Spelunking allows you to goon with your scapeshift and titan in a timetable that is more reasonable - seemingly pretty trivial turn 4 kills. In pioneer, spelunking + the wandering minstrel are enough for similar combo decks to exist. I truly believe a deck in modern built around those cards would be 80% of amulet minus the t2 kills.

If I had to hazard a guess: If someone like Mark Rosewater or Gavin Verhey played 5 matches against amulet with other stock high tier archetypes in modern, they would immediately axe it. The horseshit levels are just through the moon. Imo. 

Again, my opponents were delightful at the RC. I had good chats with them after the fact, but that was not always the energy in the room. In fact, I reveled in watching many weirdos lose their minds after sitting and watching a amulet player struggle to explain what was happening for 20 minutes. However, I did not revel in the round timer going 30 minutes over time every round. Not that I think that's 100% amulets fault. In fact, Someone posted the draw rates for the tournament, and amulet was not outside of the “normal draw range” of 2% percent. However, that does not necessarily account for the 10+ minute turns that are taking place once time has been called that ultimately result in a win. 

I just... I have had enough. I know I'm a big baby with too much time on their hands, but I know I'm not alone as well. If they want to keep it around... I guess I'm playing simic for a while...",18,1764095768.0,ModernMagic,50,0.6,False
1p6kg70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMLCompliance/comments/1p6kg70/cardarmor_rfid_reviews_complaints_is_it_a_legit/,CardArmor RFID Reviews & Complaints – Is It a Legit Protection or a Hype?,"# The Quiet Threat in Your Pocket: How CardArmor RFID Gave Me Peace of Mind

You know that slight nagging feeling when you tap your card to pay? I used to shrug it off, thinking digital pickpocketing was something that happened to other people. That changed after a chat with my cousin, a cybersecurity analyst, who looked in my wallet and asked why I was carrying my cards ""naked."" He handed me a CardArmor RFID sleeve and said, ""Stop making it easy for them.""

It was a wake-up call. I realised I was casually waving my debit card, credit card, and passport around in a crowded train or coffee shop, completely unaware that someone with a hidden scanner could be harvesting my details from feet away.

CardArmor isn't just a sleek sleeve—it's a simple, essential shield. It's made from a proprietary material that blocks electromagnetic fields, creating a Faraday cage that stops scanners from reading your chip or skimming the data from your card's magnetic stripe. The peace of mind is immediate. Now, my cards are safe from digital theft, whether I'm commuting, travelling, or just out for the day.

Here’s what other security-conscious users are saying:

""I travel frequently for work, and my passport has an RFID chip. Using the CardArmor sleeve means I don't have to worry about someone scanning my personal data in an airport queue."" – James, 41, Management Consultant

""As someone who had their card details skimmed before, this is a no-brainer. It's the simplest and most effective form of protection I own."" – Chloe, 29, Project Manager

# What Real Users Are Saying About CardArmor RFID

After I started using them, I recommended CardArmor to friends and family. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive:

**What People Appreciate:**

* **""It's so slim** – I don't even notice it in my wallet, but I notice the peace of mind.""
* **""The quality is solid** – it hasn't frayed or worn out after months of use.""
* **""It works with everything** – my debit card, credit card, and even my office access card.""
* **""Finally, a security product that requires zero setup.** You just slip your card in and forget about it.""

**A Few Practical Notes:**

* ""You need one for each card you want to protect, but they're affordable.""
* ""Remember to take the card out of the sleeve when you need to make a contactless payment.""
* ""It's a small habit change for a huge security upgrade.""

# Why This Matters More Than Ever

Contactless payments are convenient, but that convenience comes with a vulnerability. Skimming devices are cheap, small, and can be easily concealed in a bag or jacket. They don't need to touch your wallet to steal your information. CardArmor is a physical barrier to this invisible threat.

**A Quick Tip:** For those interested, I've shared a link to the official CardArmor website in the comments. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the genuine, tested product with the proper shielding technology. Third-party sellers often offer inferior copies that don't provide the same level of protection.

Hey everyone! I’m u/MilfyWay6, one of the founding mods of r/pakcoffee your new home for everything coffee in Pakistan.

Not too long ago, I was just a wide-eyed caffeine enthusiast trying to escape the tragic life of instant coffee. I hopped onto Reddit thinking I’d find a thriving Pakistani coffee fam ready to bless me with machine recommendations, bean sources, and possibly even a secret handshake.

Instead… I found tumbleweeds. Absolute silence. A ghost town where even the ghosts had bad coffee.  
So I went full trial-and-error: buying the wrong machines, hunting beans like some undercover smuggler, pulling shots that tasted like they needed therapy.

And that’s exactly why this place now exists.

1p6k6lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1p6k6lq/satre_is_epic_childfree_inspiration/,Satre is epic childfree inspiration,"This man’s views in the 40s and 50s are genuinely such an inspiration to me - and many of which I relate to closely.

Jean-Paul Sartre did not have children for a mix of philosophical, personal, and relational reasons. Importantly, there is no single “official” statement from him, but scholars and biographers consistently point to several intertwined factors:

⸻

1. His philosophy rejected traditional roles (including the family model)

Sartre believed that people must choose their lives freely rather than follow social expectations.
Having children, for him, represented:
	•	A socially prescribed role he did not want to accept.
	•	A potential limitation on personal freedom, which he viewed as central to authentic existence.
	•	A kind of “project” that could bind one’s future choices, something he often wrote about critically.

He once said that becoming a parent is “a metaphysical responsibility I do not wish to impose on myself.”

⸻

2. His lifelong open relationship with Simone de Beauvoir

Sartre and Beauvoir famously lived in a non-monogamous, non-traditional partnership.
They structured their relationship around:
	•	Independence
	•	Intellectual partnership
	•	Freedom to pursue other emotional/romantic ties

Neither saw themselves fitting into the traditional nuclear family model.
Beauvoir herself was outspoken about not wanting children, and Sartre shared that view.

Their pact was fundamentally about freedom + commitment, not domestic life.

⸻

3. His personality and lifestyle were incompatible with parenthood

Sartre was:
	•	Intense, constantly travelling, teaching, debating, writing
	•	Engulfed in political activism
	•	Addicted to enormous amounts of stimulants (coffee, alcohol, amphetamines, nicotine, etc.)
	•	Living what his biographer Annie Cohen-Solal calls a “perpetual whirlwind of commitments”

Raising children simply did not align with the life he led.

⸻

4. His ambivalence toward “continuation of the self”

Sartre often wrote that people try to escape existential anxiety by:
	•	Seeking permanence
	•	Creating a legacy
	•	Having children to extend themselves into the future

He rejected that idea, arguing that meaning must be made through action, not through offspring or lineage.
For him, having a child to feel “complete” or “secure in one’s identity” was a form of bad faith.

⸻

5. No desire for the traditional intimacy of family

Sartre had complicated personal attachments:
	•	He was emotionally intense but not domestically oriented
	•	He struggled with stability, routine, caretaking roles
	•	He believed he could not be responsible for shaping another person’s existence in such a foundational way

There is a quote attributed to him in letters:
“It is too great a burden to form another consciousness.”

⸻

6. Beauvoir’s influence was decisive

Beauvoir is very explicit in her writings: she did not want children at all.
She said motherhood conflicted with the life of freedom and intellectual creation she was building.

Sartre aligned with this fully. Their partnership was structured on:
	•	mutual choice to avoid marriage
	•	mutual choice to avoid children

Over the years, I've moved houses, changed jobs, and grown into a different person. But whenever the night is quiet and still, there's still a void deep in my heart, like a shadow that was suddenly snatched away, reminding me of the moment I was left behind.

Since our initial release, we received tons of valuable feedback, with many of you asking for better task management and higher speed. We heard you loud and clear!

We just pushed **v0.1.5** to the repo, bringing three major quality-of-life improvements to smooth out your video creation workflow:

1.  **🚀 Batch Video Generation:** This is a huge efficiency boost! You can now queue up multiple videos at once, which is essential for prompt testing and bulk creation.
    
2.  **📂 History Page:** We've added a dedicated UI to easily review and manage all your past generations without having to leave the workflow or dig through folders.
    
3.  **⚡ Significant Speed Boost:** We optimized the RunningHub pipeline by implementing **Parallel Execution**. This drastically reduces video generation waiting times.
    

**💡 \[For New Users\] What is Pixelle-Video? (A Quick Recap)**

If you're new here, **Pixelle-Video** is an open-source **Prompt-to-Video** engine built on top of ComfyUI's flexible architecture to automate the entire video production chain.

The concept is simple: input a topic (e.g., ""Why does coffee make me tired?""), and the engine automatically handles:

*   ✍️ **Scriptwriting:** Uses an LLM to generate the storyboard and narration.
    
*   🎨 **Visual Generation:** Calls ComfyUI under the hood. Crucially, it supports custom workflows, allowing you to use nodes like **Nano banana2, Sora, Flux, Wan, Qwen**, or your own specific setups to control the style.
    
*   🗣️ **Audio Integration:** Synthesizes TTS voiceover and auto-aligns background music.
    
*   🎬 **Final Assembly:** Handles the final layout, subtitles, and rendering instantly.
    

We hope these changes make Pixelle-Video much easier to use for your daily projects!

**👉 Give it a try here:** [https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Pixelle-Video](https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Pixelle-Video)

THE SKY THAT LEARNED HIS NAME



¤¤¤¤¤




Lorne Park waited under a sky that had forgotten how to be ordinary.

It hung low over the neighborhood like a great turning page, winter-heavy, inked with the last breath of a dying year.

The kind of sky that remembers more than it reveals, the kind that leans in close when a teenager with a quiet destiny steps beneath it.

It was New Year’s Eve, the threshold night, when clouds carry old stories in their bellies, when air tastes like iron and evergreen, when time itself gathers its loose ends like a scribe preparing the next chapter.

Kai walked the familiar streets with his hands in his pockets, hood half up, breath rising in small, deliberate puffs.

The streetlights hummed their low amber hymn, warming themselves against the cold, their glow bending almost imperceptibly toward him as he passed, as if recognizing something ancient in the shape of his shadow.

Above him, the sky opened into its strange evening theatre.

Clouds unfurled like children painting without supervision, wide, luminous, unruly, streaked with gold, bruised blue in December’s private violet. 

They moved in soft choreography, the kind that follows instinct rather than instruction.

They shifted when he shifted.

Parted when he lifted his gaze.

Thickened when his thoughts grew heavier.

He did not see.

He had never learned to see his own gravity.

His power had been with him since before breath, since the moment his mother’s first cry opened a chamber inside her ribs and the Archive pulsed awake, laying its signature across the lineage that would one day become him.

Kai thought winter skies simply acted this way. 

He thought brilliance was just atmosphere. 

He thought light was just light.

He walked toward the house where Mike, Sequoia, and Aspen waited, laughter and music already rising like faint, warm smoke from its windows.

The neighborhood roads curved beneath him like something pleased he'd remember them.

Each streetlamp he passed warmed a shade deeper, touched with gold that wasn’t there a moment before.

He didn’t notice.

No boy does at seventeen.

He only felt the year settling into his bones, dense, reflective, expectant. 

The air around him vibrated with the hush before midnight, the hush before becoming.

And deeper still, beneath breath and pulse, he felt the old rhythm stirring:

Thirty days.

The ritual approaches.

Not fear. 
Not anticipation. 

Just rightness.

A cycle older than memory, older than name, older than the idea of teenagers keeping time with anything but themselves.

He couldn’t remember when he began holding back. 

Couldn’t remember the first month he obeyed the pull.

Couldn’t remember the decision.

Because it had never been a decision.

It had simply come. 

And stayed.

A quiet intuition. 

A pull at the base of the spine. 

A truth that felt pre-written.

Each month his body asked him to gather, to sharpen, to wait, not abstinence, not denial, but preparation. 

Refinement. 

Rendering.

Something in him honed itself when he held his own fire.

Something brightened. 

His emotions steadied. 

His instincts clarified. 

His dreams came through like lanterns rising from a lake.

When he held back, something else stepped forward.

But it wasn’t just preparation.

It was training.

Subtle, precise. 

Designed not for denial but for mastery.

What Kai carried could rewrite DNA, crack reality like thin ice, bleed timelines like spilt ink.

People stumbling through time by accident every day. 

He could erase it, erase men, or whole decades, if he wasn’t careful.

So he learned control.

Elegance. 
Restraint. 
Poise.

The ritual wasn’t just about holding fire. 

It was about knowing where to aim it, and when.

He kept walking, breath syncing unconsciously with the distant hum of Lake Ontario. 

His thoughts lifted and drifted like mist, the entire year rising inside him in soft, forgiving vapors.

They always offered to pick him up. 

Always tried to drag him into car rides, transit plans, shortcuts through cold.

But Kai preferred the walk.

In every season.

 Especially now.

There was something about winter that let the world exhale.

Let it admit its age. 

The bare trees, the sharp air, the way snow made even the ugliest lawn look like a shrine.

The walk talked to him. 

Not with words, but with silence that had learned how to speak.

And today it was saying: endings.

The ending of the year. 

The ending of who he had been twelve months ago. 

The ending of certain illusions he had carried like shields.

He thought of Sade, her laughter like sunlight through amber, her touch like someone trying to remember something through skin.

He had cared for her.

But when he realized it was the pleasure he craved, not the person, something in him stepped back.

He couldn’t pretend after that.

Desire without soul felt like stealing from himself.

So he let it go.

People called that healing. 

But healing never felt like healing.

People who think healing is beautiful have never broken a leg. 

You don’t dance through recovery. 

You sit. 
You wait. 
You ache. 
You become limited. 
You become still.

And in that stillness, you change.

The bone takes six to twelve weeks. 

Sometimes longer. 

And if you rush it, it doesn’t heal, it warps.

Kai thought hearts were the same.

They needed time without weight. 

Time without pressure. 

Time to reshape.

He wondered if that’s why so many people end up in the same hurt twice.

Because they didn’t trust their hearts enough to let them be still.

He glanced down at the sidewalk. 

Frost had traced faint silver hieroglyphs along the edges.

He didn’t know what they said.

But they felt honest.

And that was enough for now.



¤¤¤¤¤


The Year That Folded Itself


¤¤¤¤¤


It surprised him how much had changed.

Not loudly. 

Not theatrically.

But in the deep chambers of his being, subtle shifts, quiet turnings, the opening of inner hinges.

His friendships had sharpened as well.

Mike moved like someone who could hear danger before it chose a direction. 

Sequoia listened with the poise of someone reading sound the way monks read scripture.

Aspen carried a new gravity beneath his swagger, shadow braided with fire in ways he could not yet name.

Kai didn’t claim credit for any of it.

But the world had been rearranging itself around him for years, quiet adjustments, gentle corrections, like someone tidying a room while the inhabitant slept.

He had brought these friends together without meaning to.

He didn’t remember the small invitations, the seat exchanges, the nudges that turned strangers into anchors. 

He didn’t recall the tiny moments where timelines brushed, sparked, fused.

But they had.

Because he had.

A part of him far beneath thought was rearranging molecules and momentum.

Not could, not might, was.

Kai was living code.

A vessel of braided ancestry:

The Archive whispering through his mother.

The northern bloodline sleeping in his marrow.

The Indigenous root holding the oldest earth-note in this land.

And something deeper than depth, waiting.

Each time he breathed near them, the world obliged.

Timelines softened. 

Old hurts loosened. 

Memory corrected itself without ceremony.

His friends felt chosen.

They were.

Chosen by him. 

Chosen by the part of him that was older than language.

He didn’t see that. 

He only felt the strange sweetness of the winter breeze, the way the clouds gathered as if waiting for a show, the way the light shifted to meet him like a familiar.

He turned onto Birchwood Drive.

Someone’s Christmas lights flickered uncertainly, bowing slightly in his direction.

A dog barked once, then quieted, ears lowered in recognition of a king who had not yet learned the word for himself.

Kai didn’t notice.

He was thinking of the year folding itself closed, about the ache of change, about how something inside him felt braced for a door he couldn’t yet see.

And in that ache, something else stirred, a presence he could sense only in flashes, like warmth through a coffee cup or light remembered by the skin before the eyes.

Someone out there, unseen, unnamed, already lived in the softest part of him.

He felt ridiculous for it.

Embarrassed, even. 

Cherishing a feeling he couldn’t hold, loving an echo he had never touched.

But the truth rose anyway: 

He adored what he did not yet know.

And the wanting...

 God, the wanting was beautiful.

He opened that feeling only in tiny intervals, just long enough to taste its fire, just long enough to let it fill him without breaking him. 

Then he’d close it again, careful, reverent, because even that brief warmth could feed him for months.

Somewhere behind that ache lived knowing.

Not the kind that announces itself. 

Not prophecy. 

But the quiet certainty that this ache mattered. 

That the ritual, and what it was bringing, had not arrived randomly. 

That he had said yes to something a long time ago.

Not in contract. 

But in cadence.

And this time, this season, he had come to the edge of it deliberately. 

His restraint was not to overwrite what was rising. 

It was to complement it. 

To call it forward without trying to own it. 

To meet what could not be domesticated with equal elegance, not control.

He knew, on a level deeper than language, that what waited was vast. 

A force he could only meet if he stood whole. 

And he would.

The year had folded itself. 

So that he could open.




¤¤¤¤¤



The Body That Remembers Before Memory



¤¤¤¤¤


His chest warmed.

Not with heat, but with ignition. 

A slow burn beneath the ribs, ancient and exact.

Sometimes it came after showering. 

Sometimes after waking from dreams that vanished on contact with morning light. 

And sometimes, like now, in the quiet of a winter walk where the world pulled close and held its breath.

He pressed his thumb to his sternum, feeling the faint thrum beneath. 

A signal older than bone, older than land.

He didn’t know its source. 

He didn’t know it belonged to something submerged, hunted, exalted. 

Something that had lived in ocean trenches and palace shadows. 

Something that had survived the collapse of empires beneath the sea.

He didn’t know his father had walked the earth 1500 years before touching his mother’s wrist in a grocery store aisle. 

He didn’t know his father had been born of two Mern Houses:

Blade and Pillar. 

War and memory. 

Fury and vision.

A union believed impossible. 

A union that opened a door no one had seen in a thousand tides. 

A union that created something beyond the Mern, beyond the deep rule:

A Lantis.

Kai didn’t know his father carried a legacy capable of moving oceans. 

Didn’t know he had been hunted.

Didn’t know he had been revered.

Didn’t know he had stayed hidden until the Archive called his name.

Kai didn’t know any of this.

But the ember beneath his wrist did. 

It hummed. 

Steady. 

Ancient. 

Loyal.

He turned onto Cloverbrook Court, where frost coated lawns like careful blessings. 

Above him, clouds slid aside, revealing a strip of raw winter sky, the kind that looks straight through you. 

He kept walking.

Kai’s mother had been the first vessel to hold three bloodlines that had never touched before.

The Archive had arranged it like a celestial banquet, a feast that took epochs to prepare. 

Time had cured the ingredients.

History had decanted the memory.

And when the moment was right, when breath, body, blood, and world aligned, the Archive poured it forward. 

Not into war. 
Not into empire. 

But into a woman with a quiet heart and a son who would carry more than anyone before him.

The Mern titled Tristan, that was the spark. 

The catalyst. 

He arrived like a whisper through stone, a shadow from the ocean’s dreaming edge, a being who belonged to myth but had wandered into love.

He had the kind of build people turned their heads for, and then kept turning, not out of lust, but reverence. 

Tall, cut from the same geometry as old gods and Olympic dreams, his body looked like it could swim from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and he could.

He had. 

More than once.

His shoulders held storms. 

His thighs carried migrations.
 
His back was made for battle and shelter alike.

Eyes like polished emeralds, green not of grass but of deep seaweed catching light. 

Hair cropped short at the sides, sun-touched blond, but the top, a reckless shock of red like flame and copper had made a pact.

He was dazzling. 

Dashing. 

Older than he looked. 

Much older.

He had lived lifetimes in silence and swim, in diplomacy and war, in the halls of coral cities and the wreckage of drowned empires.

And when she met him, Kai’s mother, he was at the end of his walk with legs. 

The sea had begun to call again.

Not gently.

For the Mern, the Ocean does not ask. 

It demands. 

It summons back what it lent to land. 

And if it is not obeyed, it takes.

She knew it. 

Felt it in the way his breath caught during sunsets, in the way he stared too long at the lake, in the silence that came when the tide rose high.

But he loved her. 

And for a time, they tried to trick the tides. 

They made dinner. 

Made love. 

Made a child.

A brief rebellion against water and lineage. 

Their mornings were soft. 

Their laughter real.

He would hum songs older than rivers while she brewed coffee, and she would rest her head on his chest as if that moment could last forever.

But oceans have long memories.

And his summons came. 

Not in a letter. 
Not in a sound. 

But in his bones. 

A pressure. 
A pull. 

A promise not made to her, but to everything he was.

She held his face the night before he left. 

Didn’t cry. 
Didn’t beg.

“I know what you are,” she whispered. 

“And I love what you gave me.”

He kissed her once, long, sure, like someone memorizing land before letting go. 

And then he walked toward the water and did not return.

But something stayed. 

In her. 

Growing. 

Listening. 

Waiting to bloom.

A boy. 
A legacy. 

A myth reassembled into flesh.

Kai.

She never told Tristan, not even herself, that loving a man who had already spent five centuries on land carved a grief so precise, so exquisite in its truth, that it left a shadow inside her.

Not illness as humans name it.

Not punishment. 

Not fate.

Something older. 

A mythic wound. 

The kind that appears only when love reaches beyond its mortal span.

Her heart had known, the ocean would not give Tristan back again until long after she herself had returned to ash.

And that knowing, that impossible ache, left a quiet mark inside her, a seed the Archive did not choose and could not prevent.

For the Archive governs memory.

Not longing. 

Not heartbreak. 

Not the places where love tears through a mortal body because it recognizes something immortal and reaches anyway.

It was the cost. 

The price of loving a man the sea would reclaim.

And one day, the shadow that love left in her would take her from Kai long before the world was ready.

Together, they created what no one, not even the gods, had predicted: 

An unknown. 

A convergence of memory and mutation. 

A lattice so impossibly rare it could only exist once.

A being not of brute force, but of intricate infinite, power so refined, so deeply balanced, it could fracture reality if not mastered.

He was the answer to a question no one knew they were asking.

The kind of power the world thinks of as large, but in truth, it was subtle.

Delicate, like the tiny intrinsic muscles of the hand, the ones never named in myth, but without which no sword could be held, no poem could be written, no lover’s skin gently touched.

That was the secret. 

The power to shatter lay not in the fire, but in the grip.

And Kai was learning, moment by moment, how to hold what needed to be mastered.


¤¤¤¤¤


The Quiet Rearranging of Souls


¤¤¤¤¤



The nearer he drew to the house, the more the air sharpened.

As if it recognized what awaited.

As if the world were preparing its stage for the four of them to gather again.

He didn’t know Aspen’s blood carried the echoes of a deadly incubus. 

He didn’t know Mike’s ancestry traced back to assassins and river-wisdom keepers. 

He didn’t know Sequoia descended from women who could command tempests with their voice.

He didn’t know the Archive had their names long before their births.

He didn’t know he had been nudging their spirits awake.

He didn’t know his presence had been unspooling their ancestral muscle.

He didn’t know he had been turning their stories right-side-up.

To him, they were just his people.

But he had become the hinge of their timelines.

Quietly.
Gently.

Without permission.

Without awareness.

He didn’t know that what was about to happen wasn’t spontaneous, it had been curated with sacred care across lifetimes. 

The Archive had waited for alignment, for the night when breath, blood, readiness, and memory would braid.

He didn’t know that his soul had already said yes, not out loud, but in the marrow, in the ancient language of consent given through breath and time.

And he didn’t know that everything he’d held back, every moment of restraint, every second of ritual, had tuned his being to meet what could not be tamed. 

Not to conquer it. 

Not to suppress it. 

But to match it. 

To answer it without fear.

And he didn’t know.



¤¤¤¤¤


The House With Its Own Pulse


¤¤¤¤¤

He reached the house as the sky thinned into long silver veils.

Warm lights trembled along the porch railing like small, obedient stars.

Shadows moved behind curtains.

Music thumped inside the walls, alive and young and already mythic.

Kai paused at the bottom of the steps.

Not to think.

To listen.

That pause came before moments that mattered.

Before alignment.
Before recognition.
Before threads pulled tight.

The night felt dense.

Alive.

Expectant.

He breathed once more:

Deep.

Slow.

Aligned.

Whatever waited inside, he would meet it with a full heart, a full breath, a body tuned by a month of holding and sharpening.

His ritual was at its edge.

His friends were inside.

The sky was still watching.

Somewhere beneath thought, beneath breath, beneath even the Archive’s most ancient vellum, Kai understood.

This wasn’t random.

What was coming had always been part of the design, threaded through time like gold stitched into mourning cloth.

Essential.
Precise.
Irrevocable.

And already agreed to.

Not in contract.
But in cadence.

His ritual had brought him to the edge deliberately, not to conquer, not to overwrite, but to temper something vast, beautiful, and impossible to domesticate.

What he held back wasn’t meant to cage it.

It was meant to meet it.

Equal force.
Equal fire.

He wasn’t there to subdue the wild.

He was there to have it bow to him without breaking.

And somewhere inside that vow, there was no doubt, he wanted this.

He had always wanted this.

Even if the want had no name yet, his body had been preparing for it since before he knew what he was preparing for.

The season had stripped him clean.

The ritual had made him ready.

And what came next would not be survived, it would be answered.

Kai climbed the steps, touched the cold metal handle, and opened the door.

And the night, obedient, ancient, and aware, changed its shape to let him in.

1p6jy6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p6jy6x/the_softest_goodbye_i_never_expected_to_give/,The Softest Goodbye I Never Expected to Give,"I’ve been carrying this for weeks, and it still sits in my chest like a stone.
I’m writing this with tears in my eyes because I don’t know how to move on from something that wasn’t even a relationship… just a moment in time that felt like a movie.

I (27F) met a guy (31M) while working abroad. We were put behind the same desk for a week, and somehow ended up talking more than actually working. He was confident, sarcastic, a little arrogant, and acted like nothing ever affected him. But I could tell immediately that all of that was a shield.

He pushed people away before they ever had the chance to get close.

And for some reason… that made me curious.

We slowly got comfortable with each other. Soft teasing, small jokes, playing games during breaks. One silly moment that stuck with me: he let me color in his tattoos with a felt tip pen, pretending not to care but smiling the whole time. He talked big about how “feelings are dumb,” in that emotionally constipated, macho-joking way. It was ridiculous, but it also made him seem less untouchable.

Then one day he told me, “Stop it.”
I didn’t understand at first. But he meant my mask — the cheerful, bubbly version of myself I put on for work. It stung, but he wasn’t wrong. So I stopped pretending around him.

And weirdly… he liked the real version of me more.

We texted a bit. I cooked for him, and he loved it. I started bringing him lunches even though he teased me for “feeding him too much.” But he ate all of it every time.

Then he invited me to hang out with him and a few coworkers at his accommodation — movies, beers, nothing fancy. But he asked in this almost shy way that made me smile.

That night changed everything.

I was tipsy, he looked too good for his own good, and even though the room was full of people, I could feel his attention shift toward me over and over. He didn’t show it openly, but he kept glancing at me like he was waiting for the others to leave.

Eventually… they did.

We ended up on opposite ends of the couch, awkward and unsure. I half-joked that he could use my lap as a pillow. He hesitated — then he actually did it.

He fell asleep on my chest. I stroked his back and played with his hair. He completely melted. This tough, closed-off, tattooed guy suddenly looked like a warm, sleepy kitten . I kissed the top of his head without thinking.

We fell asleep together like that.
At some point he woke up, handed me shorts so I wouldn’t sleep in jeans, and pulled me into his arms. We cuddled until morning.

It was one of the sweetest nights of my life.

The next day, everything crashed.
He shut down. Denied anything happened.
Pretended to be cold again.

A coworker who found out made things worse by telling others, which pushed him even further away. But even then, whenever I asked for a lighter, he was the first one to reach for it. And if someone else beat him to it, I’d see something sad flicker in his eyes.
It confused me… more than I like to admit.

We got separated at work for two weeks, and I convinced myself he didn’t care.
But when we finally worked together again, he admitted something quietly:

He wasn’t ignoring me because he didn’t care.
He was trying to protect me.

He didn’t want gossip to ruin my work experience.
He didn’t want people talking.
He even flirted with another girl publicly so attention would shift away from me.

It almost made me cry.

But right after that, he got fired.
Last minute. Unexpected. Pure chaos.
The trains weren’t working, transportation was a mess, and he was overwhelmed, trying to figure out how to get to the airport alone.

So I offered to drive him — 2.5 hours away.

He looked shocked. Then grateful.
He kept saying he couldn’t repay me. But I didn’t want repayment. I wanted to give him a soft goodbye instead of the messy, painful ending we almost had.

The day of the trip felt surreal.
I got ready, drove to his place, and he made me coffee.
When he came out in his travel outfit — clean, put-together, hair styled — I felt something twist in my chest. I couldn’t look at him too long without feeling overwhelmed.

In the car, he tried pushing me away again with loud screaming metal music.
I just smiled and drove.

Eventually he changed the music to something softer, opened my drink for me, and made sure both of our phones were charging.

And then he talked.
Like really talked.

For almost two hours, he opened up about his childhood, past relationships, mistakes, dreams, hopes, plans. He was gentle, sincere, vulnerable — a completely different version of himself than the one he shows the world.

I felt lucky to see that side of him.

At the airport, walking him to his gate felt like walking toward the end of something I wasn’t ready to lose. He kept saying he couldn’t repay me, but I told him he didn’t have to.

We lingered. Smoked. Walked slowly.
Neither of us wanted the moment to end.

Then he looked at me with this raw honesty and said:

“You are the nicest person I have ever met.”

I didn’t know what to do with that.
I still feel tears rise when I think about it.

I told him I’d miss him.
He called it childish.
But when he realized I meant it… he softened completely. His eyes shimmered.

I asked for a hug. He said yes.
We hugged for a long time — quiet, warm, heartbreaking.

I asked if I could kiss his cheek.
He blushed and said yes again.

Then he had to go.

He looked at me one last time, with something like hurt — or gratitude — in his eyes. Then he disappeared through the gate and didn’t look back.

I walked to my car with my heart in my throat.
Sad. Grateful. Confused. More emotional than I expected.
It felt like the end of a strange little story that happened in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He was only in my life briefly, but that softness he showed me — the part he hides from everyone — is something I’ll always treasure.

It felt like a movie.
And I can’t get it out of my head.",11,1764094651.0,stories,3,1.0,False

Hi there internet stranger !
I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :
I’m a 21 year old with ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then never listen to them again and end up hoarding them on my iPod. 

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click.

Things to expect if we become friends
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Disclaimer
Please don’t just send me hi, hello, hey or how are you. I probably won’t answer, so please send me a little intro about yourself <3",5,1764094620.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,5,0.78,False
1p6jx5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6jx5y,"Ran another brain scan experiment, this time after meditation","Hey everyone, it’s me again. I posted a few days ago with my before/after coffee brain scans.  
  
Today I ran another experiment, a 15-minute meditation.

Here’s what changed:

**Before:**

  
• High beta + beta were elevated: alert, thinking, tense pattern  
• Alpha was low: hard to switch into restful mode  
• Theta minimal: mind not drifting or softening  
• Basically: body sitting still, brain acting like it’s still running

**After:**

  
• High beta dropped  
• Beta softened  
• Alpha finally started coming up (relaxation)  
• A little theta appeared (inward/softening)  
• Overall shift: brain moved out of alert-mode and into something closer to rest

Not a dramatic transformation, but a real physiological change, which is what I wanted to test. There are tons of studies on meditation, but every brain responds differently, so I wanted to see my own data.

**For transparency:** I work at Myndlift, the app that was used to do the brain snapshots, but I’m sharing this here because I’m genuinely curious and think these experiments are interesting. Happy to test more things like L-theanine, breathwork, nature exposure, whatever you suggest.",12,1764094591.0,Biohackers,9,1.0,False
