I am attempting to make a (triple) chocolate cake using the Sally’s baking addiction website. In the ingredients, the batter calls for one cup of buttermilk, and one cup of freshly brewed coffee – Sally says on her video that you can substitute sour cream for the buttercream (which she does in the video) but when she demonstrates pouring the ingredients into the bowl, she uses part sour cream and part buttermilk. 

I don’t have any buttermilk. Can I use all sour cream instead of buttermilk? Since her ingredients call for one cup of buttermilk can I just replace the buttermilk with one cup of sour cream?

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn’t. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud… like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn’t know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn’t a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn’t wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into “fight or flight” mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just “na…na..na..” Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it’s twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*“Join us or disappear”*

He doesn’t tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called “The Order Of The Six Tones” it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader’s hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the “gifted”, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can’t. The Humming wasn’t music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn’t chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult’s activities. The cult’s main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan’s arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult’s uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him 

*“Take two days,” she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. “Listen to the world. If it sings to you… come back. If it doesn’t, walk away.”*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn’t. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn’t remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him. 

*“So,” she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, “Tell me, Ethan… did the world sing to you?”*

 Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect… maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader’s hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away… only the walls of that room knew.

1nw80h0,https://i.redd.it/083tzjoj2qsf1.png,"Underworld’s Flame: Loyalty, Power, and Love in the Mafia’s Grip","Chapter 1

My father raised me to be a king.

Not a princess, not a pawn in some arranged marriage , not a pretty daughter paraded out for alliances . I was the only child of Alessandro D'Angelo, one the most feared mafia don, and he raised me to be his heir—his successor.

I was taught to shoot before I was taught to ride a bicycle. Taught to snap a man's wrist before I was taught to dance. By the age of thirteen, I had learned the names of all the great families and how to kill them best.

He turned me ruthless. He turned me deadly. He turned me unstoppable.

And yet, somehow, I was standing opposite Rocco De Luca—the most ruthless man in the underworld—and he was staring at me as if I were a puzzle he wished to disassemble.

The air was filled with the scent of sweat, blood, and whiskey.

Underground fight clubs existed—raw, unfiltered, and brutal. The warehouse, dimly lit, was full of it. The horde of men roared as fists landed against flesh, as bones cracked under sadistic force.

I was in the VIP section, watching with detached coolness. I wasn't here to be entertained. I was here on business.

The fight in the ring was almost upon them. One man, a heavily muscled warrior with a crooked nose and blood trickling down his chest, was staggered on his feet. His opponent, a man twice as big as him, was not kind. He landed a body-blowing uppercut, and the other man hit the ground with a hard thud, skull impacting the dirty mat.

The audience cheered.

Pathetic.

The weak did not deserve to live in this world. You learned to fight, or you learned to die. Basic rules, rules that I'd learned as a child.

I shifted my focus from the ring. My prey was in this club somewhere.

Rocco De Luca.

Second son of the De Luca family. The cruelest of the De Luca brothers. A man with no compassion, no doubt, and no conscience.

I'd never seen him before, but I knew the stories.

That he never let enemies live. That his methods of torture were the stuff of legend. That he felt nothing.

He had become even more infamous after his father's death, when Rafael De Luca took over their empire. While Rafael played the strategy game, Rocco played the blood game.

And now I was being compelled to work alongside him.

My dad had made it forcefully plain—this union with the De Luca clan was of the utmost importance. A cooperative effort to stamp out a mutual enemy.

Trust, however? That I was in no position to indulge in.

A shift to my left put my senses on high alarm. I stiffened, poised, but didn't reach for the gun buckled at my thigh just yet.

Because I knew him before I'd turned even half the way around.

Rocco De Luca.

He was leaning there, leaning comfortably against the metal railing of my VIP section as though he had the world at his fingertips. The bad lighting cast harsh shadows on his face, and he looked like something cut out of darkness itself.

Black button-down, sleeves rolled up to the elbow, revealing his inked forearms. Strong jawline, dark stubble tracing his chin. And his eyes—cold, unreadable, dark brown that bordered on black.



The atmosphere between us shifted.



His mouth curled into a smirk that bordered on challenge.



""D'Angelo.""



My hand encircled the glass of whiskey I hadn't been sipping. ""De Luca.""



""You're smaller than I expected you'd be.""



""You're as annoying as I expected you'd be.""



His smirk widened by a fraction. ""I like a woman with bite.""



I scowled at him. ""And I don't like men who waste my time.""



""Shall we get down to business?"" I asked.



I sat back, sipping my whiskey. ""In a hurry?"" he asked.



""Not in the least,"" I said, but there was a glint in my eyes. ""I just like to skip the chit-chat.""



He smirked. ""Too bad. I was looking forward to it.""



There was a flash of something crossing his face—amusement, interest—but it vanished before I could name it.



""Your father hopes that we can work together,"" he mused. ""What do you think?""



""An alliance is convenient for both of us,"" she continued. ""This war that's coming up ahead is not just between small clans—it's going to catch fire. The smart ones have already aligned themselves.""



""And you'd prefer to be on our side?""



""I'd prefer that we both be on the same one."".



He looked at me. I wasn't wrong. The tension in my world was building. The families that made the bad choices would be buried.



""And what do we get in return?"" He asked.



""Resources. Connections. Power."" I stared him straight in the eye, no blink. ""The question is—do you know how to use them?""



He laughed. ""You've got a big mouth on you, don't you?""



His expression didn't change, but I saw the way his fingers twitched , the tightening of his jaw by a fraction.



""Whiskey?"" He asked holding his glass out to me.



I took the unused whiskey and dumped it, as the amber-coloured liquid poured onto the floor in front of and between us.



""I think I'd prefer poison.""



The grin faded. His expression blanked.



Boom.



The entire building shook.



A deafening explosion burst out of the door, creating a shockwave within the club. The explosion hurled bottles off the bar, men stumbling backward. Screams tore through the air as flames and smoke engulfed the exit.



Gunfire. Screams. Pandemonium.



I reached for my gun, reacted before I had even processed the attack.



Bullets tore through skin. Masked men stormed in through the broken doors, rifles cocked. They moved swiftly, precisely—trained assassins, not rogue thugs.



One of my guards fell beside me, blood spreading around his head.



I crouched behind the bar, pulse pounding but fingers steady. Rocco was already moving, shooting back without hesitation. His men were behind him, but the ambush was brutal.



My ears rang. Smoke filled my lungs.



I glanced at Rocco.



He was already looking at me.



His expression was empty, but something sharp was in his eyes. Something threatening.



""Can hold your own?"" he shouted over the gunfire.



I gritted my teeth. ""You bet.""



Another shot rocked the ring More dead bodies fell.



The attackers were closing in.



I spun around, pointed my gun, and—



A bullet tore through my shoulder.



Pain erupted through me.



Chapter 2

Fiorella



It was the way my father had referred to murder during breakfast, like he had just read yesterday's headlines.



""The De Lucases are ascending,"" he announced, slicing through his steak with a casualness that should have intimidated me. ""And with Lorenzo's murder, they’ve gotten stronger. Nobody believed Rafael would survive the coma, but since he has, they won't stop for anything."".



I shook my espresso, watching the dark liquid froth as I digested his words. ""Lorenzo deserved to die.""



""Of course he did."" My father didn't even look up as he reached for his wine glass. Yes, wine. At breakfast. That was how he started his day—red meat, black coffee, and a glass of the finest red. Alessandro D'Angelo.



My father.



“But the De Luca brothers are dangerous, Fiorella."" He finally lifted his gaze, dark and unreadable. ""Dangerous than ever before.""



I settled back in my chair, folding one leg over the other. ""And that's making you anxious because…?""



He set his knife down. ""Because the most dangerous thing worse than a dangerous enemy is a more dangerous ally."".



I allowed that to hang there between us, the gravity of his words settling in like a stone.



I had anticipated this conversation. I had seen the way my father's mind had operated over the past few weeks, strategising every move the De Lucases made. From killing Lorenzo, to destroying the foes who had tried to kill Rafael's wife. Even after Rafael had been in a coma, his brother Rocco had torn through their foes mercilessly, with no compassion.



Now Rafael was alive. And conscious. And the De Lucases were way more untouchable than ever.



My father wanted an alliance.



But alliances in this world were created in blood and betrayal. And trusting a De Luca?



That was like doing business with the devil.



""You think they'd attack us?"" I asked.



""I think they'd slit our throats if it ever became convenient for them."" He sipped his wine, eyes glinting above the rim of his glass. ""Which is why we need to make sure they never do.""



My fingers tapped on the porcelain of my coffee cup. ""And how do you propose we do that?""



He smiled, and it wasn't a pleasant smile. ""You.""



The atmosphere shifted.



I stilled. My grip on the cup tightened. ""Me?""



""You're my heir, Fiorella. My successor. You've lived your whole life showing you belong here, that you're something more than a daughter. This is your chance to show it again.""



I released a slow breath, ignoring the way my heart accelerated. ""What do you want me to do?""



""Sit with them. Work with them. Show them we are not enemies, but allies.""



""You expect me to sit with Rocco De Luca and act like I trust the man?""



""I want you to make him trust you first.""



A snort of laughter escaped my lips. ""Rocco De Luca doesn't trust anyone.""



""So you better try to make him.""



I gazed at my father, questioning whether he really believed this was a good idea, or if this was a test of some sort. Because I knew the things about Rocco.



Everyone did.



The second De Luca brother. The enforcer. The one who didn't mind spilling blood.



If Rafael was the face of the De Luca empire, Rocco was its dagger.



A man without conscience or doubt.



""I don't like it,"" I admitted.



""I don't care if you like it,"" my dad said flatly. ""I care if you get it done.""



I clenched my jaw, but I didn't argue. He had set his mind on it.



And so, I had to set mine.



Because moving into the world of De Lucas was moving into a den of lions.



And I wasn't sure if I'd be a hunter…



Or the hunted.



We were having a conversation in his study later in the evening and he mentioned the De Lucas again.



""The De Lucas are getting stronger.""



My father's voice was suave, but I felt the blade below.



I leaned back in my chair, watching him sip his whiskey, every movement calculated. My father never showed his hand, never said anything without thinking it through. He was always a step ahead, always playing the long game.



""Lorenzo's death, the attempt on Rafael's wife… all that was supposed to shatter them only made them stronger. They destroyed their enemies without hesitation.""



""And now?"" I asked, drumming fingers against my armrest.



""Now, they're unpredictable."" His eyes grew cloudy. ""And that makes them dangerous.""



I breathed slowly, letting the words fall into place. We both knew what he was going to say before he said it because he already mentioned it this morning.



""An alliance.""



""It's the smartest move."" He placed his glass down. ""War is coming, Fiorella. I can feel it in my bones. And when it does, we don't want to be on the wrong side of the battlefield.""



""And if they won't have us?""



A slow smile pulled at his lips. ""Then we help them understand that not having us isn't an option.""



It always had been. Power and strategy, blood and control. A game that I had learned how to play from the age at which I was able to hold a gun.



""Where's the meeting?"" I asked.



""At a club. Neutral territory.""



I smiled. ""There's nothing neutral about the De Lucases.""



""No,"" he agreed. ""But you'll get them to listen.""



""And Rocco?""



His smile spread wider. ""Rocco will be there.""



Of course he would.



The second of the De Luca brothers. The one they whispered about in the backstreets, the one whose very name sent men scattering for shelter.



Rocco was the kind of man who didn't even bother to hide his fangs. He didn't reign like Rafael—he devoured. And in contrast to his brother, he didn't need a throne. He was content perched on a pile of dead bodies.



I had never laid eyes on him, but I had encountered him. Seen him across rooms at parties, his shadowy presence on the edge. He talked only as required, never grinned except with a cold, sinister curve.



The kind of man who caused his foes to disappear into thin air.



""Okay,"" I said, standing up. ""I'll go.""



My father looked at me, something enigmatic on his face. Then he nodded. ""Be careful, Fiorella. The De Lucases don't play by the rules.""



I smiled. ""Neither do I.""



Chapter 3

Rocco



The scent of coffee and freshly baked bread hung in the air, along with something sugary—most likely what Rosalia had insisted the chef make. I was seated at the oversized dining table, watching as Rafael poured his wife's coffee as if it was the most natural thing in the world.



It still surprised me.



My brother—the same one who shot a man in the head without batting an eye—was now the kind of husband who poured coffee for his wife before serving himself.



Rosalia smiled and said something to him that I didn't quite catch, and Rafael responded by leaving a kiss on her temple.



Gross.



""You're making that face again,"" Riccardo told me, smiling as he picked up a piece of bread.



""What face?"" I grumbled.



""The one where you appear to have swallowed glass.""



""Maybe I did.""



Riccardo smiled, shaking his head, but Rafael was blind to us, all focus on his wife.



""Do you need something more, mia rosa?"" he asked her, voice lower than I ever recalled hearing before.



Rosalia glanced up at him, smiling gently in a way that wrapped my stomach in a knot. ""No, I'm fine. But you should eat before your meeting.""



""I will."" He brushed a lock of hair out of her face. ""You should return to bed after breakfast. You were up too late last night.""



Rosalia flushed a little, glancing over at Riccardo and me. ""Rafael—""



""What?"" He smiled. ""It's the truth.""



Riccardo gagged, stuffing bread into his mouth.



I just sipped my coffee.



This was one version of my brother I was still not used to.



The Rafael I had grown up with was cold, calculating—a man who ruled with strategy and violence. The Rafael across from me now was still ruthless, still deadly, but he had softened around the edges.



Because of her.



And the craziest part?



He didn't seem to care.



""Anyway,"" Rafael said, finally focusing on me, ""we have business to discuss.""



I set down my coffee. ""I figured.""



""Tonight, you're meeting with Alessandro D'Angelo's daughter.""



That made me curious.



I rocked back in my chair, eyebrow rising. ""Fiorella?""

That said, I want to make sure we’re not missing out on any other solid options out there, especially since we’re working with a tight budget.

So I'd love to hear people's prospective. I started a job at a coffee shop about 3 weeks ago. The owners are lovely, pay is fine, not extraordinary, but I'll be fine. 

The problem is I'm standing for seven and a half hours, plus a 40 minute round trip walk home. I'm in a stupid amount of pain. I have a few past issues with my feet which I had hoped I had passed, but apparently I have not and I'm doing everything I can to make this work, but I can't see the light.

I've tried changing shoes, insoles, elevating my feet after work, rubbing them out several times a day, baths, ibuprofen, etc, but I can't make the pain stop and I'm nearly to tears standing after a few hours because the floors are all concrete. It's to the point that I was nearly crying on the couch after work because even elevating them hurt. 

I don't want to quit, because the job is genuinely really nice, but I'm rather scared I'll end up back in physical therapy and I'm so tired from being in pain for 8ish hours a day. 

I have the option to quit and just be a substitute for my school district as I job hunt for something within my degree, but this also creates the chance that I might be unemployed. I can personally handle my finances for a few months, but not to much after that. 

What would you do?

**CHAPTER FOURTEEN**

“Hey, can we turn on the music device?”

“It’s called a radio, Nathaniel.”

“Can we turn on the radio?”

“Be my guest.”

Nathaniel studies the radio set into the dashboard of Dumah’s Lincoln Continental. He twists a knob. Nothing happens. He pushes a button. Nothing happens. Nathaniel glances at Dumah. He can see that Dumah is watching out of the corner of his fake eyes. Nathaniel slowly guides his finger toward another button on the radio. He lets it hover there as he gives Dumah another glance.

Dumah shakes his head ever so slightly.

Nathaniel moves his finger to the left over the next button.

Dumah’s fake eyes turn back toward the road. He nods once.

Nathaniel turns on the radio.

Immediately the interior of Dumah’s Lincoln Continental is filled with ear-shattering music.

—DON’T TRY TO FIND ME, PLEASE DON’T YOU DARE—

“WHY IS IT SO LOUD?” asks Nathaniel, trying to be heard over the woman singing.

“YOU MESSED WITH THE VOLUME,” yells Dumah.

—JUST LIVE IN MY MEMORY, YOU’LL ALWAYS BE THERE—

“IS IT THIS KNOB?” Nathaniel twists the knob he twisted moments before. The music gets even louder. Worse yet, the song reaches a crescendo, which is a fancy word for a really loud part. The entire car vibrates like it’s about to explode.

—ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE LOVE TO YOU—

Dumah slaps Nathaniel’s hand off the knob and frantically twists it counter-clockwise. The music becomes so faint that it’s barely audible.

“Thank you,” sighs Paschar from Nathaniel’s lap.

Nathaniel hangs his head sheepishly, and sticks a finger in one of his ears, wiggling it around. “I think I broke one of my ear parts.” He pops his finger out and inspects the goop on the end of it. “Brother, look at this.”

Dumah instinctively looks and immediately regrets his instincts. He sighs. In his head, he is strategizing how he’s going to talk his way out of being tossed in a cell of the oubliette. The oubliette is like a jail in the Pit where they lock away people for a long time, and in the Veil, time works different, so a long time could be a really long time there. Dumah does not want to spend a really long time in the oubliette. If he could, he’d rather spend exactly no time in the oubliette. In fact, he’s starting to think the oubliette was one of his brother Abaddon’s worst ideas.

Dumah steers the car through the middle of Angie. The small town seems strangely abandoned: closed signs hanging in shops with dark windows, very few cars parked on the street, not a single pedestrian in sight. The Lincoln Continental stands out like a sore thumb, which is a turn of phrase I’ve never really understood. I mean, I understand how to use it, but where it came from, I may never know. The universe is full of mysteries.

Speaking of me, I’m not actually there to witness any of this. You may recall, I got my hand crushed and am currently hiding in tall grass with Dutch one town over, plotting a middle of the night shopping trip. But I think it’s important you know what’s going on over in Angie with the angelic trio, because otherwise, things are gonna make less sense down the line. Also, it adds a bit of suspense!

“Where is everyone?” ponders Nathaniel.

“That’s a good question,” Paschar replies. He pauses in thought. “You just gave me an idea… one that could potentially help us immensely down the line!” The doll-totem goes silent. Not that he was particularly noisy before, but there’s a noticeable shift in the air when Paschar leaves his station.

Nathaniel picks up the totem like it’s a walkie-talkie and holds it to his now-cleaned ear. He shakes it. “Paschar?” The doll does not respond. Nathaniel tosses it over his shoulder into the backseat. It bounces off the back and tumbles to the floor, where it will likely be forgotten until Paschar speaks up again.

Ahead, the Angie Police Department seems equally quiet. As Dumah pulls his Lincoln Continental into a visitor parking space near the front entrance, he sees movement inside. Aside from the brightly-lit front lobby entrance, there is a single office window with the lights on. The shades are drawn though, so all he can make out is a blurry silhouette as someone moves around.

Nathaniel also notices the office and its mysterious occupant. “There’s a distinct lack of police vehicles,” he comments, peering around the otherwise empty parking lot. Not a single other car is there, which is odd considering someone is clearly in the building. Maybe they walk to work?

“They must have sent every single squad car to catch us in the swamp,” Dumah says with mild amusement. “I wonder how they tracked us there.” He motions with his chin toward the occupied office window. “Who do you think that is?”

“Probably the person who disseminates information out to the entire force.”

“A herald?”

“I believe so.”

“Hmmm.”

The two angels exit the vehicle, leaving the silent doll-totem on the floor of the backseat where they have already forgotten it. The night air feels physically heavy with humidity and heat. From the sound of things, the town of Angie is only inhabited by crickets. Back in third grade, my homeroom teacher had a lizard he kept in a glass case that he named Godzilla. He named the lizard Godzilla, not the glass case. Godzilla ate live crickets, except sometimes the crickets escaped. I don’t know how. But you could hear them cricketing from different parts of the classroom. It was annoying as Hell. It’s hard to focus on doing your SRAs when there’s a cricket chirping from the cubbies right next to you. I wish I could remember that teacher’s name. I think it started with a G. Maybe a P.

Oh well.

Dumah and Nathaniel trudge up the steps to the front entrance of the Angie Police Department. They can see the front desk before they enter. There’s a male police officer sitting there in his uniform, writing on a small pad of paper. He’s a middle-aged man with a shiny, bald head and glasses. I can’t tell you anything about him beyond that, because I’m not there as this happens. I know it’s probably confusing that you’re reading the angels’ perspective as told by me, Alex, but it’s kind of important, so just bear with me.

The desk sergeant looks up as they enter. “Can I help—” The words catch in his throat when he sees Dumah. “—you?” His forehead wrinkles up into a frown. “You’re that lawyer.” He sizes up Nathaniel in his fancy clothes. “Who’s this?”

Dumah clears his throat. “Ah, yes, this is my associate, Mister— uh… Nathan.” He makes a grand flourish at Nathaniel with his arms.

The officer squints suspiciously. “Is that a first or a last name?”

Nathaniel nods and smiles. “Yes.” He continues to smile as nothing more is said. The smile starts to feel forced as he side-eyes Dumah to try to get some hint as to why the police officer’s frown has deepened at his response.

“First,” whispers Dumah out of the corner of his mouth.

“First!” Nathaniel exclaims excitedly. “It’s my first name, of course. First and only one I’ve ever had.” He pauses as he thinks about this. “I suppose that makes it my last name as well.”

The desk sergeant is still not amused. He pulls a spiral notebook over from another section of his disorganized desk and starts writing on it. He looks up, makes some mental notes about the pair, then writes some more things down. Several minutes of this goes by without another word spoken.

Dumah finally breaks the silence. “We came to see if there have been any leads in your department’s investigation of the missing children that my clients were recently wrongly detained under suspicion of perpetrating.”

“I’m not at liberty to answer questions about an open investigation.” The policeman stares coldly at him for a second before returning to his notes.

“Yes, well—“

Mister Nathan nudges Dumah in the ribs. Dumah glances at his blond associate. Nathan gives a silent gesture with his head in the direction of the glass panels that separate the front lobby from the rest of the police station. Numerous empty desks litter the area with various personal items such as photos of loved ones or cherished pets, a cracked-leather baseball glove, and numerous coffee mugs that say such trite slogans as, “Who’s in charge? I am.”

Far in the back, a small form sits in a metal chair with wheels on it next to one of the desks. The chair spins slowly, coming to a stop facing the desk. The person reaches out, touches the desk, and gives a light push, starting the chair spinning again in a slow circle. As their rotation briefly faces one of the overhead lights, Dumah and Mister Nathan catch a glimpse of the individual and immediately recognize her face.

Dumah does a double-take. That’s where you look at something but your brain doesn’t fully process what you’re seeing and you have to stop yourself from focusing on something else and look at it again. “What in the eighth circle of Hell?” stammers Dumah.

“I beg pardon?” The bald-headed desk sergeant behind the counter catches his gaze and follows the direction with his own eyes. He joins in observing the teenage girl using Lafleur’s office chair as a merry-go-round. “Oh, yeah, there she is. Look, before you start tossin’ accusations— she was lookin’ pretty banged up when she walked in the door. Ain’t nobody here did that to her, I can assure you. I ain’t privy to what went down between her and that big fella she was with, but the officer handling her case can fill you in when he gets back from the can.”

And with that, the desk sergeant slaps shut the notebook he was writing in, drops his pen on top of it, then entwines his fingers and clenches his jaw, staring down the two angels in disguise.

Dumah and Mister Nathan turn back toward the entrance where a number of benches are made available for people to sit in while they wait to report their wallet got stolen or their neighbor is a drug dealer and they think they saw them chopping up a dead body. You know, typical police office stuff. They take a few steps out of the range of the policeman’s hearing.

“That’s not Alex,” Nathaniel whispers.

Dumah sighs, “Yes, obviously. It must be the second Chullachaqui.” He takes a third look back over his shoulder at the spitting image of me that’s just goofing off like I totally would never do while stuck sitting around in an empty police office (it’s true, I used to spend a lot of time at the police station back home, and there’s no way I’d spin around so much in one of those chairs without barfing). Fake Alex starts snooping through one of the drawers in Lafleur’s desk. She finds a set of handcuffs and her mouth turns into the letter ‘O’ before curling up into a smile. “And here I am, her own personal lawyer. This is going to be incredibly easy. Looks like we didn’t need Paschar’s help after all.”

Speaking of Paschar— out in the car, the totem-doll is talking at length about something, unaware that he’s been left alone. I can’t tell you what he’s saying, since I’m not there, but hopefully he revisits the conversation some other time when he’s not just talking to the inside of an empty Lincoln Continental.

Dumah and Nathaniel have finished their secret huddle. They both nod with grim determination at what they must do. If this were a sports game, they’d each put a hand in to form a hand pile, and then each throw their individual hand back and yell something supportive like, “GO TEAM!” But neither of them ever watches television, let alone human sports, and they have no understanding of typical sports team behavior, so instead each one makes a small hand gesture and whispers, “amen,” very quietly.

Dumah, the angel of death and silence, turns on his fancy-shoed heel and marches back to the front desk with the bald policeman behind it, who has taken to reading a magazine about sport hunting. I wonder if sports hunters do huddles? I suppose if they all put a hand in at the end, there’s a risk of someone accidentally getting shot. Dumah clears his throat as he steps up to the officer.

“Yessir?” the desk sergeant asks him.

“I need to speak with my client in private,” says the lawyer from the law office of Raguel, Phanuel, and Zenas. He repeats the end of his statement, just to make sure the officer on duty understands. “In private.”

At the same moment, the sound of a toilet flushing can be heard from a nearby restroom. This is followed a moment later with the sound of water running from a faucet, the squeak of a metal handle being twisted, and then the ruffling of paper towels being pulled from a dispenser. Lastly, the clop of boots on linoleum tile as the bathroom’s occupant approaches the door.

“You’re in luck,” the desk sergeant replies, “Here comes the officer in charge.”

Dumah looks in the direction of the men’s restroom as Remy Lafleur opens the door. The two men lock eyes. Dumah’s expression doesn’t change as he recognizes Lafleur. This is partially because Dumah’s eyes are fake. The other reason is because he has no idea that Lafleur has spent the better part of an hour filling out a report of all the violent acts Dumah and Dutch and their blond associate inflicted upon the girl now seated at his desk, as well as the five abducted children before her, details so horrific that when she was done describing them to him, he needed to excuse himself for a moment to go retch up his dinner of microwaved pizza.

Lafleur’s eyes however, are quite expressive. “You!” he shouts, his expressive eyes filling with white-hot rage. His hand immediately goes to the holster where his gun would be if he hadn’t left it on the chief’s desk earlier in protest of being left out of the manhunt.

Dumah shrugs and gives an insincere smile. “Me!” he says with utter naivety.

Nathaniel, for his part, recognizes that Lafleur just tried to go for his gun. “Uh—“ he gestures at the placement of the officer’s hand, but Dumah isn’t paying any attention to him, as he’s too busy approaching the enraged peacekeeper with the dumb innocence of a child.

“We need to speak with—“ Dumah begins to say something along the lines of how he’s there to totally not murder the teenager in the other room in front of everybody present for the good of all mankind, but Lafleur doesn’t give him the chance. He hurls himself bodily at the weird, pasty, white man with the dead eyes and rictus grin, tackling him to the linoleum floor as each man’s teammate watches in shock and confusion.

Nathaniel and the desk sergeant look at each other. There is no moment of mutual understanding passed between them. The policeman pulls his sidearm. Mister Nathan points his finger like it’s also a gun and snaps his thumb at him one time. One time is all it takes for the desk sergeant’s pistol to turn glowing-red hot, sizzling in his grip and branding his palm with the texture of the grip.

The desk sergeant howls with pain, grabbing his burnt hand with his other non-burnt hand, and instinctively lets go of the cause of his suffering. The pistol clatters to the floor next to the grunting, struggling pair of bodies who have begun an impromptu wrestling match.

Between grunts, Dumah manages to stutter out, “What— is— the meaning— of this— assault?” He gets a mouthful of Lafleur’s knuckles for his trouble. Unfortunately for Remy, Dumah’s teeth are not going to get knocked out by some mortal man’s fist. Instead, they open huge gashes in Lafleur’s flesh and splatter his blood across Dumah’s pale face. In return, Dumah sticks several of his own fingers in Lafleur’s mouth, in an effort to try to pry the man off of him.

Remy bites down, his teeth piercing the skin suit but not the bone beneath. And because Dumah doesn’t feel pain, this does nothing to stop him from gripping the inside of Remy’s head with his bony digits and prying it backward to the point that it starts to feel to Lafleur like the top of his head might come off. He snarls and clamps his jaw down harder, dragging his teeth along the invading fingers and degloving the set of them, leaving him with a mouthful of human skin.

“You are ruining my suit!” Dumah shouts in frustration.

The crazed Lafleur responds by spitting out what he can of the finger flesh with a disgusted, “BALRGARGH!” and then trying to gouge out Dumah’s eyes with his thumbs. This is equally unproductive, as Dumah’s fake eyeballs just bob like apples into the empty void of his skull, leaving Remy with two hands gripping his opponent’s head like a bowling ball. Thinking he successfully blinded him —which is a kinda messed up thing to think— Remy pries his fingers out, only to feel the squishy orbs of Dumah’s eyeballs magically reset themselves into his face, bulging slightly as they adjust. He sees this, and something in his brain breaks. He twitches. He blinks. He questions his own eyes, whether they are messing with him or he really just witnessed this creep’s eyeballs come popping back out of a deep blackness like the answer on a Magic 8-Ball.

And then he feels something hot press into the back of his head. It’s no longer hot enough to burn, but the barrel of the desk sergeant’s gun still makes him flinch when he feels it.

“Stop what you’re doing please,” Nathaniel says calmly, “We have no quarrel with you, sir.”

His finger isn’t on the trigger, but Lafleur doesn’t know this. His reptile brain crawls back into the dark murky recesses of his mind and he carefully brings his arms up, holding his hands above his head in surrender. Looking across the room, he sees his coworker the desk sergeant, clutching his branded hand and also holding both hands above his head. They’re now at the mercy of these two twisted, child-murdering psychos. At least, that’s what Remy thinks.

“With God as my witness,” Remy snarls, glaring at Dumah who is holding his own hand to hide his skeleton fingers, “I will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth and I will—“

“Oh shut up,” Dumah tells him.

Lafleur feels an unnatural heaviness in his throat. The words die on his tongue. If I were there (which I’m not), I would tell you about the thick, black fog that’s clouding the room at this point. Dumah’s death fog. It’s probably making Remy and his friend the desk sergeant feel really tired and achy. It does that. It kills small animals and elderly, but for healthy people like two trained police officers, it just makes you feel like you’re coming down with the flu or something. I fainted once from it, when I was little.

Dumah turns his attention to the officer working the front desk. “Go fetch my client.” Then he kneels down in front of Remy and collects the mangled finger pieces, still wet with the crazed man’s saliva. He holds them out so Lafleur can see his handiwork. “These were pristine,” he tells him with annoyance, “From this moment until the day you die —twenty-three years, eight months, and thirteen days from now— bedridden in a hospital with your many loved ones around you, I want you to count your blessings that you performed this sacrilegious act when I was attempting to get in the good graces of my superiors. Otherwise, the next time I set foot on this plane, I would be wearing your face.”

None of what he just said makes sense to Lafleur, but he can’t speak to ask what it means. All he can do is dart his eyes around in a panic while waiting for the person standing behind him with the gun to decide whether to leave him with enough of a face for Dumah to even wear it.

“Uh—“

The desk sergeant swallows but can’t seem to get the lump in his throat down.

“She’s gone.”

All four look through the glass separating the lobby from the office area. There is no teenage girl sitting at Lafleur’s desk, casually spinning herself around in his chair. There’s nobody in the room at all from the look of it. Across the way, a strong wind blows the curtains framing an open window.

Dumah snaps. “SON OF A BITCH!”

———

Outside in the Lincoln Continental, Paschar finally stops explaining the idea that Nathaniel gave him and that he had stepped away to enact.

1nw7wb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nw7wb5/should_you_trust_the_best_coffee_maker_mr_coffee/,Should you trust the best coffee maker Mr. Coffee 2131084,"Testing out the Mr. Coffee 2131084 has been a regular part of my mornings over the past few weeks. With its 12-cup capacity and programmable features, this coffee maker promised to make my caffeine routine smoother, and I was intrigued to see if it could deliver on the hype. The stainless-steel design paired with intuitive digital controls immediately caught my attention as I unboxed it, adding a sleek touch to my kitchen counter. It wasn’t long before I had it brewing my first pot, and the experience has been a blend of ups and some minor drawbacks.

**Design and Build**  
The first thing that stands out about this drip coffee machine is its compact yet robust design. Measuring 9.1 inches in depth, 6 inches in width, and standing at just under 13 inches tall, it fits snugly on my kitchen counter without taking up much space. The black exterior combined with stainless steel accents provides a modern, understated aesthetic, which complements most kitchen décors. While the design doesn’t scream luxury, it feels solid and durable. The carafe, though lightweight, has proven sturdy enough through day-to-day use. However, the plastic components, like the lid and the filter basket, feel slightly flimsy compared to the rest of the machine.

**Usability and Programmable Features**  
Operation is straightforward with its fully automatic mode, and I was thrilled to explore the programmable Brew Later feature. Setting it up the night before meant waking up to the aroma of fresh ground coffee, which gave my mornings a much-needed boost. The buttons and digital interface are simple to navigate, even for someone like my spouse, who isn’t very tech-savvy. The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause option was an unexpected lifesaver during rushed mornings, as it allowed me to sneak a cup mid-brew without any mess. On the downside, the timer for setting brew times is slightly cumbersome—it requires cycling through the hours and minutes instead of having direct input options.

**Upsides**  
- Strong Brew Selector lets you enjoy a richer, bolder coffee flavor at the press of a button.  
- Brew Now and Brew Later options add flexibility for early risers or night owls.  
- Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause feature is practical for impatient folks like me who hate waiting to take that first sip.  
- An automatic cleaning reminder and integrated cleaning cycle simplify maintenance.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The machine can get a bit noisy during the brewing process if you’re in a quiet space.  
- Build quality of some plastic components could use improvement, especially for long-term use.  
- The paper filter system means added recurring costs and isn’t the most eco-friendly option.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
I was particularly drawn to the Strong Brew Selector, as I enjoy a more robust flavor in the mornings. It delivered as promised, crafting bolder coffee that retained the complexity of the grounds I used. While the machine efficiently brewed large batches (up to 12 cups) without compromising flavor consistency, I realized the water filtration system was a quiet star here. By removing chlorine, it played a significant role in ensuring the coffee’s taste wasn’t muted. However, one minor critique would be the extended brew time when using the Strong Brew option—it’s not too long but feels a tad sluggish if you’re in a hurry.

[Check Mr. Coffee 2131084 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0dzdrg6d1/)

**Competing Products**  
When I compared this model to similar drip coffee makers in its price range, it held its ground well. Machines like the Cuisinart DCC-1200, though equipped with a reusable filter, lacked the sleek programmability of Mr. Coffee 2131084. On the other hand, budget-friendly models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew struggled to deliver the same rich flavor consistency. However, higher-end competitors, such as some of the Breville models, provide a more premium stainless-steel build and faster brew cycles—but they’re priced significantly higher, making this coffee maker an attractive value option.

**Value for Money**  
Cost efficiency is where this coffee machine shines brightly. While it doesn’t boast luxury bells and whistles, it provides plenty of practical features for a reasonable investment. Given its programmability, cup capacity, and useful auto-cleaning functions, the device offers solid day-to-day utility. Even with a few caveats, it’s a lot of coffee maker for those staying within a specific budget without venturing into higher-end, pricier alternatives.

POV Jocelyn



“Shit, shit, SHIT—”



The words tear from my throat like a battle cry. My heel catches the elevator threshold like it’s personally offended by my existence.



I’m airborne for exactly two seconds. Papers explode from my death grip like the world’s saddest confetti. My coffee launches across pristine marble flooring that probably costs more per square foot than I make in a month.



My dignity? Already dead and buried six feet under.



I hit that floor like a meteor strike, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear the universe laughing.



“Smooth, Jocelyn. Real fucking smooth.”



I’m scrambling on hands and knees, chasing scattered documents across marble that’s so polished I can see my own mortified expression reflected back at me.



This is it. This is how I lose the only job that could save Mia’s life—face-first on the 43rd floor of some corporate palace that screams money and intimidation from every surface.



“Ma’am, are you—”



“I’m fine!” The words snap out harder than I intended, but panic makes me sharp-edged.



The secretary behind the massive desk looks like she’d rather call security than acknowledge my existence. Her nameplate gleams in gold letters: Patricia.



“Just… me versus physics. Physics won, I guess.” I’m hauling myself upright, while my hands won’t stop shaking, and it has nothing to do with the fall.



Twenty-six hours at the hospital watching your six-year-old fight cancer will do that to you. Sleep becomes optional when your kid’s life hangs in the balance.



Patricia’s mouth twists like she’s tasting something particularly unpleasant. “Mr. Wolfe doesn’t tolerate—”



“Disruptions. Crystal clear.” I straighten up, trying to look like a functioning adult instead of a tornado survivor.



The mantra starts looping in my head like a broken record: ‘Don’t mess this up, Jocelyn. You can’t afford to.’



Triple salary.



The words dance in my vision like a mirage.



Enough for Mia’s treatment. Enough for the experimental therapy her doctors mentioned in hushed tones. Enough to maybe—maybe—keep my baby alive and healthy.



If I don’t faceplant again in the next five minutes.



“You’re the new assistant?” Patricia’s voice could freeze hell over and charge admission.



“That’s me. Professional disaster, at your service.” The sarcasm slips out before I can stop it, but I’m past caring.



A door slams behind Patricia’s desk, and the sound ricochets through the space like a gunshot.



Then he walks out, like he owns the world.



Broad shoulders that strain against a charcoal suit, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms that should be illegal. Hair that’s somewhere between gold and ash, perfectly tousled in that way that takes either professional styling or incredible genetics.



Phone pressed to his ear, voice cutting through the air like a blade: “I don’t give a damn what Shanghai thinks. Fire them. All of them. I want new contractors by morning.”



Then he turns and those eyes hit me like a freight train carrying a cargo load of holy shit.



Green like sea surface, like emeralds, like every cliché poets use when they’re trying to describe something indescribable. They’re sharp enough to cut glass and focused enough to dissect my soul in under three seconds.



Jesus Christ, he's beautiful in that dangerous, untouchable way that makes smart girls do monumentally stupid things.



There's something about him. Something that pulls at the edges of my memory like a half-forgotten dream. I know this face or maybe I've imagined it a thousand times.



The way he carries himself, that particular tilt of his head, even his presence feels achingly familiar.



The recognition hits like déjà vu mixed with pure, undiluted want.



“You’re late.” He ends his call with military precision, sliding the phone into his pocket without breaking eye contact.



“Sorry, traffic was—”



“I don’t want excuses. I want results and discipline.”



His voice hits different. Low, commanding, with an undertone that sends weird shivers down my spine for reasons I absolutely cannot and will not analyze right now.



“Right. Results and discipline. Got it.” My own voice sounds foreign, breathless in a way that makes me want to kick myself.



He’s already moving, all purpose and controlled energy. “Conference room. Cunningham files. Twenty minutes.”



“Which Cunningham files?”



He stops. Pivots. Those green eyes narrow to laser points that could probably bore holes through steel.



“The ones you should have reviewed instead of whatever kept you looking like you went ten rounds with a blender and lost spectacularly.”



Ouch. Direct hit to the ego.



“I was at the hospital—”



“Personal problems stay personal. This is business.”



Cold bastard. Beautiful, intimidating, completely heartless bastard.



The next eight hours are psychological torture disguised as employment.



Every order delivered like I’m an incompetent child who can’t be trusted with safety scissors. He criticizes my filing system, my coffee-making skills, my ability to transfer calls without hanging up on people.



Nothing I do meets his standards, which apparently exist somewhere in the stratosphere.



But I need this job. Mia needs this job.



So I swallow my pride, along with several creative profanities, and do whatever Zayden Wolfe demands. Even when my body keeps freaking out around him.



Something about him sets my nerves on fire, but I can’t figure out why.



Maybe it’s just intimidation. Rich, powerful men have that effect, right? The whole alpha predator thing that makes normal humans want to either flee or submit. Basic biology. Except it doesn’t feel basic. It feels complicated and messy and terrifying.



At exactly five o’clock, I bolt from that building like it’s on fire and I’m the last person to notice.



Straight to the hospital. Straight to Mia. Straight to the only thing that matters.



She’s awake when I slip into her room, dark curls spread across the pillow like a halo. Those huge light-green eyes, that came from someone I try very hard not to think about, light up when she sees me.



“Mama! Look what I drew!”



Another tiger. Always tigers.



This one is orange and black, with fierce eyes and powerful paws. She’s been drawing them for months now, ever since she started the new treatment. Tigers in every possible configuration—sleeping tigers, prowling tigers, tigers with cubs.



“Why tigers, baby?”



She considers this with the seriousness that only six-year-olds can muster. “Because they’re brave and strong. Like my daddy would be if I had one.”



My heart cracks clean in half. “Mia, sweetheart…”



“I know I don’t have a daddy. That’s okay, Mama. But sometimes I pretend he’d be like a tiger. Powerful and protective. He’d fight the bad things and keep us safe.”



My hand moves to the birthmark on my collarbone without conscious thought. Hidden beneath my collar, where no one can see, that heart-shapet spot that’s been there since birth.



Seven years ago. A masquerade gala I had no desire to attend at first. Champagne and masks and a stranger who made me feel alive in ways I didn’t know were possible.



Eyes that burned like fire. Hands that worshipped every inch of my skin like I was something precious. A voice that whispered praises like a prayer while he traced that birthmark with his tongue, calling it a lucky charm.



I ran before he could wake. Before I could fall harder. Before I could tell him he’d changed my life forever in ways he’d never know.



Somewhere in this city, that stranger is living his life—successful, powerful, probably married with a perfect family—while his daughter draws tigers and dreams of having a father strong enough to save her.



He has no idea she exists. No idea she’s fighting for her life. No idea that every day she slips a little further away while he makes million-dollar deals and lives his perfect life.



The stranger who gave me the most beautiful thing in my world.



The stranger who never knew he had a daughter.",1,1759421029.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

This sounds dumb but tracking my water helped me stay consistent with IF in an unexpected way.

Been doing 16:8 for about 4 months. The hunger part got manageable but I kept ""accidentally"" breaking my fast by mindlessly grabbing flavored drinks or adding cream to coffee out of habit.

Started using a water tracking app (WaterMinder, nothing special) just to see how much I was actually drinking. But it had this side effect of making me more mindful about what I was consuming during fasting hours.

Unexpected benefits:

- Can see exactly what I'm drinking and when
- Helps me stay mindful during the fasting window
- Visual progress is oddly motivating
- Realized I was getting most fluids from non-water sources

Game changer moment: Set reminders to drink plain water every 2 hours during my fast. When I'm properly hydrated, I don't get those ""am I hungry or just bored?"" moments as much.

Now I consistently hit 60+ oz during my eating window and another 20-30oz while fasting. Energy levels are way more stable and I'm not constantly thinking about food.

The app isn't specifically for IF but it's been super helpful for staying on track. Anyone else use tracking tools for fasting discipline?",2,1759420950.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

1nw7tk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nw7tk5/looking_for_some_advice_please_on_a_grinder_400/,Looking for some advice please on a grinder [£400 budget] starting our on my espresso journey,"Hello all. Sorry for the long post!
I have had a Delonghi Eletta Cappuccino superauto for 5 years. 
Served us well, with over 20,000 coffees made in that time.
This is finally starting to die and for that I am happy, as it's become a watery, acrid coffee that it pulls and is undrinkable most of the time.

So, I am looking to get into the world of espresso machines. Toyed with the idea 5 years ago but with time being of the essence back then, I plumped for a superauto.

It is such a mind boggling world with all the different options of machine and grinder and so on, so some hands on advice is very much appreciated.
I have lost count of how many reviews, YouTube vids etc I have watched and I can never really tell if those reviewers have a vested interest in the brand.

Coming from a superauto background I am looking for ease of use, convenience and speed.

In terms of the machine, it looks like a Bambino Plus is right for me. I love the look of the Profitec Go and similar models, but as I need a grinder etc, my pockets are not deep enough at the moment.

In terms of the grinder, I am not looking to single dose, as I think my missus will have a fit if she has to stand there and weigh out beans and so on, when a quick push of a button would normally give her the caffeine fix on the Delonghi.

So, I have been looking at hopper grinders. In particular grind by weight, as I can't get my head around grind by time and how you judge it to make sure your dose is correct etc.
Again, looking for simplicity in terms of dialling in, general workflow, so I don't get it in the neck for buying a complicated or long winded set up 😂

I really like the look of the Mignon Libra. Has anyone had any experience with that? Looks solid and looks like it could outlive me.
It's at the very top of my budget (well, it's over but I would rather buy a grinder that I don't want to replace for a loooong time). Or is that just overkill for someone on the beginning of their espresso journey?

The others I have seen are the Sette, or the Encore ESP (which I know is not by weight). I hear big swings in opinions on the Baratza stuff. Plus, after 5 years of the noise levels of the Delonghi built in grinder, a quieter option than the Baratza is needed me thinks.

Or are there any recommendations for a quality grind by time grinder that's pretty much foolproof!

P.S. the grinder will have to come a little later as I can't afford both at the same time, so will have to use pre ground (nice coffee shop very local where I can get fresh grinds) in the meantime with pressurized basket... But anything must be a step up from the Delonghi.

Any advice, tips are much appreciated please.

1nw7tgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nw7tgy/the_great_board_game_takeover/,The Great Board Game Takeover,"I swear, for a minute there, I thought our living room was slowly transforming into a board game cafe, except without the actual cafe part and with significantly more dust. Every time I walked through, I felt a lowkey wave of anxiety. Leo, bless his collector heart, had his vintage Catan editions, obscure RPGs, and an ever-expanding stack of Kickstarter exclusives perpetually sprawled across the coffee table, overflowing onto the rug. Ben, our resident chill tech guy, just navigated the cardboard labyrinth like it was part of the decor. Chloe, our super-organized marketing whiz, was starting to leave passive-aggressive notes on the fridge – things like “WARNING: Rogue dice detected!” Honestly, I was highkey ready to snap.

Tbh, I used to love chilling in the living room after a long day, but lately, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like a storage unit. I’d nudge Leo’s stack of *Gloomhaven* boxes aside with my foot, trying to find a clear spot on the couch, and just sigh. We'd been trying to plan a house movie night for weeks, a throwback to the days when we first moved into this urban apartment and the space was actually *usable*. But as Friday night approached, I looked around and realized there was literally nowhere to sit, let alone set up the projector. Ngl, I even considered just watching the movie in my tiny bedroom, which kind of defeated the whole “shared living” purpose.

That evening, I gathered everyone. ""Okay, so, movie night is tonight, right?"" I started, trying to sound calm, but my internal voice was screaming. ""But where are we even gonna *sit*? This room is kinda… taken over by the board game apocalypse."" Leo looked up from his phone, seeing the mess with fresh eyes for what felt like the first time. ""Oh, wow. Yeah, it's a bit much, ngl. My bad, guys. I just keep meaning to organize it."" Chloe, usually so focused on her schedules, looked genuinely relieved. ""You're right, Leo. That's so valid. I love the games, but I can barely walk through here."" Ben just nodded, ever the quiet observer.

We decided we needed a system. We set a 30-minute timer. Leo, surprisingly, took charge, moving his more valuable games to his room for safekeeping. Chloe grabbed all the stray dice and cards, sorting them into designated bins we found in the hallway closet. I even tackled my own stack of forgotten books and a perpetually shedding blanket, realizing I was contributing to the chaos. We vacuumed, threw the blankets in the wash, and transformed the chaotic dumping ground into a proper, cozy movie zone. We even pooled some cash for a giant pizza order and a ridiculously large bag of popcorn, which Ben happily went to grab.

Sitting there, laughing through a cheesy action movie, surrounded by my amazing, slightly messy housemates, I realized how much better it felt to just talk it out and work together. The room was clean, the vibes were immaculate, and honestly? We love to see it. It wasn't just about cleaning; it was about reclaiming our shared space and remembering why we chose to live together in the first place.

1nw7s0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nw7s0u/growing_up_watching_family_consumed_by_smoking/,Growing up watching family consumed by smoking and then getting addicted anyways,"Hello everyone, just wanted to share my experience with cigarettes, getting addicted, and my ongoing battle to try and quit. 

I grew up around a deli for most of my life that sells cigarettes, so they have always been as normal as coffee or Little Debbie cakes or something like that. regular items you can buy at a local convenience store. I always hated the smell. I grew up with asthma that kinda stopped being as severe or impactful to my life as I grew older. The smell always gave me headaches, and I'd be in such a snippy mood if someone around me was smoking. 

Funnily enough, I never minded the smell of weed, and eventually, around high school, I dabbled in that first. Fast forward through the rest of high school and college, and I smoke weed and maybe around half a pack of cigarettes daily now. 

I think back at how I got here, and I'm honestly disappointed. You'll always hear the same old cliche story from smokers whenever you ask them how they got addicted.

""Well, I tried it once and then I tried it again and two times became four and..."" etc etc.

For me, casual cigs while drunk in college were the introduction. And then I had my first long-term girlfriend. Conveniently for me, she also smoked and thought smoking cigs was ""hot"". I don't mean to blame her for my addiction, but I grew up relatively insecure and bullied, and I thought it would keep me desirable to her to keep smoking if anything, so I thought nothing of it. I realize now I pursued the version of myself that I thought she wanted, and not the one that is most authentic to myself. 

  
I honestly feel like I lost the version of myself that I aspired to keep through all the ridicule, shame, and bullying. Maybe it seems a bit dramatic based on what I've laid out here, but I write this post after trying to replace cigarettes with exercise, since I used to exercise a lot more often in high school and college. I used to do gymnastics and calisthenics, and even run somewhat consistently. Now I'm riddled with anxiety and depression, dissatisfied with my job and my body. 

  
I write all of this not to throw a pity party for myself, but to celebrate trying again. I have always been ambitious in a way that makes everyone around me doubt me. Sometimes I've failed, and other times I've exceeded my own expectations. Regardless, it's been about 3 years of daily smoking, and it's going to take a lot longer than one miserable workout to shake that habit off, and I'll never know if it's possible until I try. There are great aspects to life that I know I'm limiting my enjoyment of by smoking. 

Thanks for reading, and hopefully we can all take it one day at a time.",1,1759420816.0,stopsmoking,0,0.99,False
1nw7rjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1nw7rjx/the_proximity_project_rome/,The Proximity project - Rome,"# TLDR;🚉 I built an interactive map to visualize how well-connected parts of Rome (and other Italian cities) are by trains and trams — it all started from a Reddit post!

https://i.redd.it/q9xr3ti41qsf1.gif

Hi everyone! 👋  
I wanted to share a project I've been working on: it's called **The Proximity Project**, and it's an interactive web map that shows how easily different areas can be reached from the nearest train or tram station.

🔗 **Try it here** → [https://proximity.duckiesfarm.com/italy/rome](https://proximity.duckiesfarm.com/italy/rome)

# 🗺️ What does it do?

It visualizes **isochrones** — colored areas that show how far you are (in minutes) from the nearest **rail** or **tram** stop.  
That means you can instantly see which areas are well connected by **reliable, rail-based public transport**, which tends to be more punctual than buses, especially in cities like Rome.

This can be super useful for:

* **Tourists** looking for short-term stays that are well-connected, even if outside the historic center
* **Expats or remote workers** trying to find a place to live without needing a car
* **Locals** who just want to better understand their city's public transport network

# 💡 How it started

A while ago, I saw a [Reddit post from a user](https://www.reddit.com/r/roma/comments/1ib2ue7/mappa_di_roma_dentro_il_raccordo_indicando_in/) who had manually created a map like this, just for fun.  
It inspired me [to build a quick prototype](https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1j3gwkc/metroproximity_project/) while I was traveling for work. I shared the early version on Reddit, got some positive feedback, and thought — why not make it into something more complete?

And here we are 😊

# 🌟 Features

* 🧭 Search any address
* 📍 Automatically detect your location
* 🚉 Visualize all isochrones globally, or select a specific station
* ⏱️ Click any area to see how far it is from the station
* 📱 Works on desktop and mobile

# 💬 Feedback welcome!

I'm still actively working on it, and any feedback (bugs, ideas, suggestions) is more than welcome!  
Also, if you find the project helpful and want to support it, you can “buy me a coffee” here ☕ https://buymeacoffee.com/nicolcoffee. All the source code is open and [available here](https://github.com/nicolgit/proximity)

1nw7px2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw7px2,What anxieties do smokers have when trying to stop?,"
1. Fear of failing and relapsing I can't go on, the smoker thinks. Maybe I'll give in to a cigarette. I'll start smoking again when I'm under stress. Although this fear is normal, the reality is that every effort moves you one step closer to achievement.

2. Fear of the symptoms of withdrawal Many people think quitting is a terrible idea because they are afraid of tension, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, etc. However, these symptoms are transient, and they get less severe every day until they go away entirely.

3. The fear of losing comfort or enjoyment For smokers, smoking is a way to unwind after a stressful day or to enjoy coffee. They worry that life won't feel complete or interesting if they don't smoke. That feeling of comfort was actually a nicotine-induced illusion, and real enjoyment starts when you take back control of your life.

4. A fear of putting on weight Since the body tries to replace nicotine with food after quitting, many people are concerned about gaining weight. Although this is possible, it is easily controlled with a balanced diet and moderate exercise. A little extra weight is not nearly as important as health.

5. Apprehension about losing one's social identity Some smokers believe that smoking is a natural part of who they are or how they spend time with their friends. They worry about feeling alone or kicked out of the group. But as time goes on, you'll come to appreciate and value yourself more for making the decision to safeguard your health.

6. Anxiety about managing stress without smoking Many people think that smoking cigarettes can help them relax. Actually, the stress is caused by nicotine. You only need a little time to learn healthy coping mechanisms after quitting, such as deep breathing, movement, or even a glass of water.

Therefore, read ""How to Quit Smoking in 30 Days"" right now if you truly want to get over all of these worries. In summary, Chapter 7 of the book discusses all of these anxieties and how to overcome them before you even stop smoking. I can speak from personal experience when I say that I have been smoke-free for 17 months after 7 years of smoking.

I'm also wondering what type of phone spoofing scam this is, what's the endgame for the scammer?  Is my company the one being scammed, or is it the person calling us who is being scammed, or is the caller the actual scammer?

For the past 2 weeks, my business has received 2 or 3 calls daily from angry customers who want to cancel their coffee subscription that they ""didn't sign up for.""  We are a coffee company, but the brands they keep bringing up are in no way affiliated with us, nor do we offer any subscriptions.  I've got a small list of different companies that they mention and all are the same when you look them up when it comes to people complaining that they made a one time purchase and now they're being sent coffee they didn't order a second time.  

After letting them know that we aren't affiliated with the company they are looking for, I ask the same questions each time.

1.  How did you get the phone number to call?

2.  What number did you dial?

3.  Where did you buy the product?

On question 1, they always say the company's website or they searched it on Google.  When I go to that website, there usually isn't a number to be found anywhere, and Google search doesn't really seem to get me there either.

On question 2, they provide me with a number.  After our call ends, I call that number and it's clearly a spoofed number that redirects to our phone number.

On question 3, I get a mix of answers.  A couple have said ""I bought it online from the company's website"", or I bought it at a store.

Read about how three guys own more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans. How wages haven't moved since 1971. How we're the first generation in modern history that will be poorer than our parents. How the climate feedback loops are already triggering. How microplastics are literally in our bloodstream now. How democracy is just theater while lobbying firms write the actual legislation.

And that's the fucking problem, isn't it?

We've reached this bizarre point in human history where we have unprecedented access to information. We can see *exactly* how the system is rigged. We can trace every dollar, every policy, every mechanism of extraction. We understand that: 

* The political system is captured by donors, not voters
* The financial system is designed to concentrate wealth upward through compound interest, asset inflation, and wage suppression
* The housing market has been turned into a speculative asset class
* Healthcare is a profit-extraction scheme, not a service
* Education has become debt-bondage for the working class
* The climate crisis is accelerating and those responsible will die comfortably before facing consequences
* We work more hours for less purchasing power than our grandparents while productivity has nearly doubled
* The social contract is dead. Pensions are gone, healthcare is unaffordable, retirement is a fantasy

We know all of this. The data is irrefutable. And yet... nothing changes. We just keep scrolling. Keep working. Keep participating in the very system that's grinding us down.

So here's my actual question, and I'm being completely sincere: What the fuck are we supposed to do?

We've tried this. The data is clear, your vote barely matters. Princeton did a study analyzing 1,779 policy outcomes and found that public opinion has ""near-zero"" impact on policy. What matters? Economic elites and organized interest groups. The donors pick the candidates before we ever see a ballot. Citizens United made it legal to buy elections. Both parties are funded by the same corporations. Sure, there are marginal differences on social issues, but on economic structure? They're playing for the same team.

**Option 2: Revolution/Eat the Rich**

Okay, but this isn't 1789. These people have private security, offshore accounts, citizenship in multiple countries, bunkers in New Zealand, and enough surveillance technology to know you're planning something before you finish typing it. Plus, it's not just one tyrant in a palace anymore, it's a decentralized network of shareholders, hedge funds, family trusts, and corporate boards. You can't storm the Bastille when the Bastille is a distributed financial system operating across 40 jurisdictions. And even if you could? They have children, succession plans, and a legal system that would crush you long before you got close.

**Option 3: Reform from Within**

Become a politician. Work in policy. Join an NGO. Fight for change through institutions. Noble idea, except those institutions are the problem. The system doesn't tolerate reformers, it absorbs them, co-opts them, or spits them out. Even the most well-intentioned politicians become captured by the funding requirements to stay in office. You either play the game or you lose.

**Option 4: Individual Optimization**

The bootstraps approach. Work harder, earn more, invest smarter, escape the system through personal success. And sure, some people manage it. But even if you personally succeed, you've just become a slightly more comfortable participant in a broken system. You haven't fixed anything, you've just climbed higher on a sinking ship. Plus, the math doesn't work for most people. You can't budget your way out of systemic wage suppression. You can't side-hustle your way out of a rigged economy. Individual solutions to collective problems are just... coping mechanisms

**Option 5: Drop Out**

Stop participating. Stop consuming. Starve the beast. Build communes, live off-grid, reject the system entirely. This is the one that actually keeps me up at night, because theoretically, this is the answer. The only real power we have is our participation. If everyone stopped working, stopped consuming, stopped paying taxes and mortgages and generating revenue for these systems—it would collapse in weeks.

Maybe it's not ""how do we fix the system"" but ""how do we build lifeboats while the ship sinks?""

A bit about myself, I'm 46 female living in Toronto. I find as i grow more into myself and work on myself, i seems to be leaving old friends behind. I am changing and evolving.  I don't want to be stuck in the same mindset for the rest of my life.  And I'm finding myself losing friends who are stuck in their high school years mindset and refuse to change and grow.  So I find myself alone a lot.  I don't mind being alone because I do enjoy my own company.  But i do admit i miss having someone to do things with.  Foe example, traveling.  I want a friend who is open to new things, open to growth and working on themselves.  So when we travel and talk, we have a common understanding and a common goal.  If you're in Toronto and if you want to connect and get coffee somewhere... one thing I should mention i am a wheelchair user so the coffee place we meet needs to be wheelchair accessible!!!

You’re Not Alone—Here’s What Helped Me,"I just wanted to share a little bit about what it feels like stepping into motherhood for the first time. Honestly, it can feel like a mix of pure joy and total overwhelm, sometimes in the very same hour. You have this tiny little human who completely depends on you, and even though it’s beautiful, it’s also exhausting in ways I didn’t fully imagine before.

When I became a first time mom, I felt this huge pressure—like I had to “do it all” perfectly. From keeping the house in order to making sure the baby was happy, my brain was constantly running in circles. I remember asking myself: *Am I doing enough? Am I ruining my routine by not having one?* And sometimes, even simple things like drinking my coffee while it was still hot felt impossible.

Something that really helped me was learning how important little rituals and routines are—not just for the baby, but for me too. I realized that being at home with your baby doesn’t have to feel like you’re just surviving each day. There are ways to actually *thrive* in that season, even if it’s just creating a consistent nap schedule, finding a pocket of “me time,” or letting go of guilt when the laundry piles up.

On that note, I came across (and now personally recommend) a really thoughtful blog post called **“**[Mastering the Stay-at-Home Mom Routine](https://doparenting.com/mastering-the-stay-at-home-mom-routine-your-guide-to-thriving-not-just-surviving/)**: Your Guide to Thriving, Not Just Surviving”**. It goes into simple routines and mindset shifts that make a huge difference for any parent trying to balance it all, especially if you’re home with your baby as a new mom. If you’re curious, you can read it [Here](https://doparenting.com/mastering-the-stay-at-home-mom-routine-your-guide-to-thriving-not-just-surviving/).

I know not every mom’s journey looks the same, but there are definitely some shared feelings and challenges, especially at the start.

So I’m curious—if you’re a first time mom (or even if you’re not), what’s one thing that helped you get through those tough first months? A routine? A mindset shift? Or maybe a small everyday hack that saved your sanity? Would love to hear your thoughts.",1,1759420385.0,Parentingandfamily,0,1.0,False

Day 4 of the search: I begin to question the nature of my reality as I spiral downward into this dark, dark rabbit hole. ""Is this real? Am I real?"" I lost count of the runs. Cows... trav.. meph and Andy. Hours. Chaos and worldstone keep. Some suggested pits? Gave it a shot. Terror zones? Sure. Ill try anything at this point... with 0mf I switch between players 1, 3, 5, and 7 none of which are giving me what im looking for.

I find some great stuff. Mara's, occy, Andy's... and some awesome runes! 3 guls,  2 Mal, 2 sur runes, ohm, an Um and a cham... Awesome! But no freakin monarch shield?! How can this be?! The search must go on though...

I lose track of time. Ran out of coffee. I've searched everywhere. I begin to think to myself... this can't be right? Is something broken? ARE MONARCH SHIELDS EVEN REAL?! I begin to lose myself in the vast sea of white items the cows leave behind with their lifeless corpses. Single player has me feeling secluded and alone - with only my mind and the hollow never-ending Moo's of the cows. I've become numb.. slightly deranged even. Im one of them. I AM THE COW... no.... Maybe the game is broken? I even questioned my ability to read at one point. Maybe they've been dropping and my mind has deteriorated from all those MOOs to see them right in front of me?! How can I find all these high runes but no freakin monarch shield?! I spiral deeper into madness.

Then I remember my first post when i was considering my return to the game. A truly wise man said, ""dont start playing again, just go ahead and hit yourself with a hammer now and get it over with."" I see... i see it now....

I enter the garage. Grab my hammer. ""This is it. It's time...""

NO. I must carry on! I must.

I make my return to the chaos sanctuary. All hope is gone. The shell of the human I once was is just going through the motions. For a single moment -  I  regain focus - the attacks, precise. Movements, sharp. 

Then it happens.

I see it. Right there in front of me. ""Monarch. Its real. It IS real!"" My mind clears and I return to reality. My decent into madness is over. The clouded veil lifts from my foggy mind as i return to town on my way to get it socketed.

Its over. The spirit shield is mine. (It also rolled with 35fcr haha)

Its also dinner time. This weary traveler can finally rest... for now... this is the game is remember.

1nw7he9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nw7he9/dibble_and_the_b52_with_hyperdrives/,Dibble and the B-52 with Hyperdrives,"""Our quantum fold technology doesn't fail, but your perversion will fail.""

Ko'ol told the press conference, all eight tentacles gesturing with mathematical certainty. His species, the Quorath, invented quantum fold technology three thousand years before humans discovered bronze. Their machines don't leak. Their coolant doesn't crystallize.

Which made tomorrow's flight the perfect setup for something impossible.

Detective Dibble watched from the back, chewing a plastic coffee stirrer. He'd seen three murders before breakfast. This press conference smelled like number four.

Commander Vex'thani found him at 06:00, holding a gilded envelope. ""Detective, you've been selected as official observer for humanity's first intergalactic flight. Tomorrow, a B-52 bomber will jump to Andromeda via quantum fold.""

""Why me?""

""Council statute requires a neutral witness. The Quorath have wagered considerable credits that your antique will vaporize during translation.""

Twenty years investigating murders in the outer sectors. He'd never traveled on an explorer vessel.

""When's departure?""

""14:00 hours. Launch Bay Seven.""

The B-52 Stratofortress sat under sodium lights, eight engines modified by human experimentation, held together with rivets and optimism.

Captain Elena Rios met him at the boarding ladder. ""Detective? Welcome aboard the Ghost of Seattle.""

""You're flying a museum piece across 2.5 million light-years?""

""The Quorath build their fold-ships from scratch with exotic alloys. But this old girl? Her wings were designed to flex, to absorb punishment. That same principle applies to dimensional shear. The Quorath see a museum piece; we see the most robust structural foundation ever to leave atmosphere.""

Dibble drifted into the cargo bay. Near the quantum drive, a coolant valve glistened with frost.

""That normal?"" he asked Sergeant Park, the engineer.

Park squinted. ""No. Q-coolant runs at 4 Kelvin, but it should be contained. Ko'ol's people topped it off this morning.""

Ko'ol himself floated over. ""Coolant pressure is precisely 4,773.2 kilopascals. All parameters are perfect."" He looked at Dibble. ""Your species sees anomalies everywhere because you build machines that constantly fail. Quorath engineering does not fail.""

Dibble wrote in his notebook: *Frost shouldn't exist if system is perfect.*

At 14:00 hours, eight engines roared. At 0.3 AU, the hyper-ring deployed.

""Translation in thirty seconds,"" Ko'ol reported. ""Please try not to embarrass your species.""

The universe folded.

Then—BANG.

""Status!"" Rios barked.

""We're stuck in the fold,"" Lieutenant Singh reported. ""Translation incomplete.""

Through the viewport: not stars, but shimmer. Reality's fabric visible, threads of probability twisting.

""Impossible,"" Ko'ol breathed.

Park checked his panels. ""Coolant's at zero. We bled out during the jump. Life support? Four hours. Quantum field integrity? Maybe two before we snap back randomly.""

Dibble pulled out his notebook: *Trapped in hyperspace. Impossible crime. Perfect alibis.*

Dibble interviewed each crew member.

Park: ""Coolant went from ninety-eight percent to zero during translation. That's not a leak. That's sabotage. Only Quorath had access this morning.""

Ko'ol's bioluminescence flared defensive purple. ""Absurd! This failure is human incompetence. Your primitive copper fittings contaminated the system.""

Dibble floated to the coolant valve. The frost had crystallized into tiny green beads.

He scraped one loose. Held it up to his flashlight.

*Anomaly: Q-coolant doesn't crystallize unless contaminated.*

Dibble gathered the crew in the bomb bay.

""Ko'ol, your people's engineering is perfect. So if the coolant failed, it was deliberate. Q-coolant doesn't crystallize—but Q-coolant adulterated with platinum ions does. Creates a slow leak that only manifests under translation stress. Only Ko'ol had the knowledge and access.""

Ko'ol's bioluminescence cycled through angry reds. ""The Quorath have held the monopoly on intergalactic travel for three thousand years because we earned it. We don't sabotage!""

""Then help us fix it,"" Rios interrupted. ""If you're innocent, help us survive.""

Ko'ol fell silent.

Park studied the drive. ""We could use hydraulic oil and synthesize oxygen from life support, create a makeshift coolant—""

""That will destroy the drive!"" Ko'ol protested.

""Better than dying here,"" Rios said. ""Park, how long?""

""Ninety minutes.""

They worked in silence, mixing ratios that made Ko'ol's translator sputter mathematical obscenities.

""This is madness,"" Ko'ol whispered. ""You're breaking every law of proper engineering.""

""Our species,"" Dibble said, ""has been making broken things work since we built boats from trees. You wanted us to fail. Now you get to watch us succeed.""

""Captain, we're go,"" Park reported.

""Then let's show the galaxy what humans can do. Energize the drives.""

The universe groaned. Reality bent, protested. The fold shuddered.

But held.

Five heartbeats. Ten. Fifteen.

BANG.

Outside the viewport: Andromeda.

""We did it,"" Singh whispered.

The delegation that met them was seventeen species representing the Andromeda Collective.

Ambassador Thel'vor spoke first. ""Humans of Earth. Tell me, have the Quorath shared our technology with another worthy race?""

""Share?"" Dibble said. ""We bought schematics from them.""

The delegation fell silent.

""The Quorath didn't discover fold technology. You gave it to them. Didn't you?""

Thel'vor's light dimmed. ""Three thousand years ago, we offered fold technology freely, asking only that they share it with other species. The Quorath agreed.""

""But they lied,"" Singh said.

""They claimed seventeen races declined the technology. That only the Quorath possessed the sophistication to use it safely."" Thel'vor brightened with anger. ""We believed them.""

""Ko'ol contaminated our coolant to make us fail,"" Dibble explained. ""To maintain the Quorath's exclusive control.""

Ko'ol's bioluminescence went dark.

""Is this true?"" Thel'vor asked.

Ko'ol's tentacles trembled. ""We are the superior minds. We earned the right to control the technology. We protected them from their own inadequacy.""

""By ensuring we never got the chance to try,"" Rios said.

""The monopoly ends today,"" Thel'vor declared.

Weeks later, Ko'ol was convicted of sabotage and conspiracy. The Quorath Collective paid reparations to seventeen Andromedan species and forty-three Milky Way civilizations.

Seventeen species requested human engineering consultants. Not because humans were better, but because humans were different. Willing to break things, rebuild them, and make them work anyway.

Dibble stood in Launch Bay Seven one last time, watching engineers swarm over the Ghost of Seattle.

Captain Rios found him. ""They're building a monument. Putting her in the Andromeda Museum of Impossible Engineering.""

""Poetic.""

""You could stay for the ceremony.""

""That's not what I do. Besides, I've got a case waiting on Ganymede.""

Dibble walked toward the freighter docks, coat flapping, coffee cup in hand.

Behind him, the Ghost of Seattle sat surrounded by engineers from seventeen species.

The impossible ship that crossed galaxies.

Truth be told, I actually decided to take a break from reddit and I haven't been thinking a lot about MK

That said, it does work. On a semi-instinctual level, I've put enough effort into this that when my brain registers, ""This is a dream"", I automatically start saying Moon Knight Moon Knight Moon Knight repeatedly.

The effect of this is that he is in fact summoned to my dream, even if only for a brief period of time. I theorize this is repeatable within a single dream.

In order to continue this and evolve my MMK, Mental Moon Knight, I must take at least half an hour regularly throughout the day to look at Moon Knight content.

You may think I'm crazy, but it works. I haven't beem assaulted by any enemies since that first night. I see this as an opportunity to cultivate my MMK. Because my demons **will** come, they always do.

And when they do, the Fist of Khonshu will be waiting for them.

P.S. Read the first issue of the Mackay Run. Hunter's Moon sounds interesting, my understanding is the that the run that got Khonshu imprisoned is shit and therefore not part of my personal canon, MK is running a whole organization here, he has an assistant who's job isn't tongwt him coffee, but does and he goes to a therapist. Also, the AVENGERS sent him to therapy?? Or did they just tell the therapist to see him because he *wanted* to go to therapy? No idea. Pretty cool, though ",2,1759420098.0,MoonKnight,0,0.75,False

I’m currently using Planet Label since I’m doing custom size (3.5” x 1.5”) and material (natural felt). Would there be any home printing setup that could replicate this? Not sure if there are smaller home printers that can do a rough matte material

Struggling with MOQs especially when working with very small coffee lots of <50lbs

Thanks!

1nw7bua,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Roto-RooterOfficial/comments/1nw7bua/the_most_common_plumbing_mistakes_homeowners_make/,The Most Common Plumbing Mistakes Homeowners Make (and How to Avoid Them),"Want to avoid costly plumbing mistakes? Any time you catch yourself saying any of the following phrases, think twice:

# 1. I can probably put this down the drain, right?

If you have to ask, you probably shouldn’t! Generally speaking, water is the only thing that should go down your drain, or waste and toilet paper if you’re flushing the toilet. The list of stuff you *absolutely should not* put down the drain is much longer than the list of stuff you should, and it includes:

* Any kind of fat, oil, or grease
* Coffee grounds
* Garbage
* Bones or shells
* Wet wipes (including wipes labeled “flushable”) 
* Silverware or plasticware

Note that this means the garbage disposal, too! It’s meant for disposing of small, soft food scraps, not anything larger or more durable.

# 2. Should I turn the water off before I work on this?

Yes, you almost certainly should. You can make a big, ugly mess very quickly if you forget to turn off the water supply valve before working on something like your sink or—heaven forbid—your toilet. If in doubt, it’s almost certainly better to turn the water off before you start working on it. And if you don’t know where the supply valve is, take that as a sign to do a little more research before you tackle the project.

# 3. This chemical drain cleaner should do the trick.

It honestly probably won’t. Chemical drain cleaners often do more harm than good. They’re not especially effective for resolving a tough blockage, and they can actually damage your pipes. Either use a plumbing tool like a plunger or drain snake, or give your local plumbing pro a call.

# 4. It’s only a little leak/clog; I can get it fixed later.

Plumbing problems are like what Hemingway said about going broke: They happen gradually, then suddenly. You have no realistic way of knowing when that leak is going to turn into a burst pipe, or that slow-flushing toilet is going to become a backed-up sewer line. We can’t say this enough: Deal with plumbing problems as soon as you notice them—and if you can’t deal with them yourself, call a professional.

# 5. This DIY project is a little dicey, but I can probably do it. 

Yes, you’re a beautiful genius, but you’re also (probably) not a trained plumber. (If you are, hi: Roto-Rooter is hiring.) 

There are a whole lot of plumbing projects that are beyond the average homeowner’s DIY skills. Stuff like unclogging a sewer line, installing a water heater, or rerouting pipes is all best left to a professional, and even smaller repairs can actually be faster and cheaper when you call a plumber. You’ll rarely regret talking to a professional, because even if you don’t make any catastrophic mistakes, there’s probably a better way to spend your afternoon than swearing at the P-trap under your bathroom sink. ",1,1759419807.0,u_Roto-RooterOfficial,0,1.0,False

Its only day 5 of the trip and it still has 7 more days to go. Honestly, it feels like this is a repeating cycle, and I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if it’s as bad as it feels.

My mom has always openly favored my brother whos 25 btw. On this trip, she was buying him things, praising him constantly, and thats not the issue, but she would deliberately pull me down to make him look better. When I showed interest in something small (like a shawl), the vibe instantly turned into “you want everything.” When in fact i havent even bought a single thing on this trip apart from a coffee a day.

Later, I made a harmless joke about sleeping arrangements, like yeah you all can sleep together and your raja beta and suddenly my dad exploded — accusing me of “mocking them,” “being dramatic,” and “showing attitude.” He even kicked a suitcase near me. My mom immediately took his side. Then the blame was thrown on me for “ruining the mood” and “wasting the money spent on the trip.” I froze and didnt speak up cos i was scared he would make a bigger scene and it triggered him more , the quieter i was. He said so many mean things.

The weirdest part? My mom suddenly switched to being nice later, like nothing happened. But by then I was already numb. My brother actually understood and supported me, but it still left me broken.

This isn’t just one fight. It’s a pattern constant comparisons, my feelings always dismissed, sudden explosions from my dad, and then gaslighting after. I’ve realized a lot of my PTSD symptoms come from this (emotional withdrawal, trust issues, feeling like I’m always the problem).

I feel so stuck. I want to leave my family 

home ASAP, but it’s complicated .

1nw79t3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw79t3,"A disappointing, but fresh, RCIR: Menu H, best by Nov2027","Hi folks!

Normally RCIRs are hard to beat, but this menu, due primarily to the mains, disappointed me quite a lot.

Other aspects, given the freshness, were amazing!

Pics 1-5 show packaging and contents. Pic 5 also shows the prepared mint isotonic tea drink.  It was gross. I just don't care for any of these French beverages that have the mint in them. I've had 3-4 different ones and I just don't care for them.

Pic 6 shows a solid breakfast of Muesli,  chocolate biscuits, and a hot cocoa mixed with a coffee. I made the Muesli cold this time and actually preferred it this way for this flavor. The chocolate biscuits were top notch flavor and crisp given the freshness. If you've never had an army mocha, you need to try it with these French components. 

Pic 7 shows the soup and salted biscuits. Yes, even the salted biscuits were great! A rare find in a wild RCIR. The soup is ""meh"", it's hot, but not super flavorful or anything. 

Pic 8 shows a lunch I had. The cheesy tuna spread, salted biscuits,  and the coconut tuna main.The spread is fairly pungent and a very strong flavor. I could see some folks not liking this for sure. The main was not good. It lacked that wonderful coconut flavor and was basically just a mushy, under seasoned mess. The onky redeeming aspect was the glorious chunks of tuna...I mean, crazy huge chunks of protein! 

Pic 9 shows the last main, the Chicken CousCous. Again, this was bland, underseaoned mush. The only redeeming aspect here was, again, lots of big chunks of protein. The 2 sausages in this were so utterly bland they just tasted like nothing.

Pic 10 shows a glorious chocolate bar with almost no bloom! A very nice, and rare, thing to find in one of these! It was excellent! Great snap and deep chocolate tones.

Pic 11 shows the chocolate dessert.  My kiddo hated this. I warmed it up in a water bath and it was great! Very, very, rich chocolate flavor. You have to love dark chocolate if you're gonna eat this.

Pics 12-16 show all the standard stuff you get in a RCIR, biscuits, jam, fruit bars, combat crunches, and nougat. All of these were great and perfectly fresh! Made for wonderful snacks at various points of walking!

So, a large part of a ration is the mains. RCIRs are well known for having some of the most flavorful and amazing mains like duck confit, ostrich, Risotto,  and pork cheek Ravioli,  but these mains were both just so bland and mushy. It's very unfortunate they ended up together. Regardless,  I'm thankful for the meal and the experience in having it!

We met up for coffee a few days ago. It was a bittersweet reunion; we talked about what we’ve been up to (she got her first boyfriend, had a new job, started therapy) and then went into the break-up. She admitted that she was in a bad place, not sure of herself and seeking safety, and my break-up really messed with her fragile self. 

It all reawakened when she got into a romantic relationship, a lot of old wounds opening up and wanting attention, so she’s been getting therapy and I came up in the conversations. She’s never been sure of the reason and always felt like she had done something wrong, which I assured her wasn’t the case at all and that out of all the people I’ve had to leave behind in my life for various reasons, she was the hardest because I didn’t really want to, but had no choice. I could see she needed something I couldn’t give and no matter how much I liked her as a person, I could see myself carrying a double burden of always needing to consider both hers and my own needs way more than normal. We rehashed all that happened as we remembered it, I apologized for being unclear at the time (which I probably was, because I was so bad at setting boundaries and scared of hurting her more than necessary) and that it was really never about her personality or anything she did. We talked a bit more and parted ways promising to see if we could reunite our little study group - we were originally five people that had a super tightknit group for a few months. 

I feel good about the meeting and I think she does too - she expressed how grateful she was for this chance to clear things up and already felt lighter knowing it wasn’t anything she did. But she was still full of the same nervous energy as back then, very eager to please and leaving no space for a single silent breath. I hope she does good in the future, and I can definitely see us meeting up to reminisce with the gang, but not hanging out alone. ",4,1759419659.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

I stumbled across this acronym and decided to figure out what it’s all about! The journey took me back in time, as understanding how energy was used in the past helps explain why VPP is such a big deal today.

# Back in the 70s, Energy Flow Was Simple



https://preview.redd.it/kl6t64jzwpsf1.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&s=de14edda1894bb745fccd69fe58d0b029daab035

Pretty straightforward, right? Energy moved in a simple chain, with no need for complex systems.

# What About Electricity Generation in the 80s?



https://preview.redd.it/kgujyhg0xpsf1.png?width=2195&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e7b4b5467460c4b616f5c6e0013d082eb340b2

Energy mostly flowed one way. We burned something—coal or oil, for instance—and used the heat directly or spun a turbine with steam (watch out for pelicans along the way!). A generator turned mechanical energy into electricity, which we then used at home to whisk batter or brew coffee. Along the way, energy radiated into space, warming the universe, though some of it got trapped in attic insulation—inevitable waste we couldn’t avoid.

# A Shift in the 90s



https://preview.redd.it/i51l99b1xpsf1.png?width=2216&format=png&auto=webp&s=094705f9f60af66ff839c3d543607c5a719ec72e

Suddenly, energy production diversified, and energy started flowing in multiple directions. Some clever mind invented the microprocessor, revolutionizing how we control processes. Engineers even realized a fridge could work in reverse—and voilà, the heat pump was born! This opened up new possibilities for energy management. At the same time, President Kekkonen no longer set electricity prices over evening tea for the next five-year plan after consulting Ahti Karjalainen. The electricity exchange market was born—an unheard-of concept! Prices began to fluctuate within a year, even daily or hourly. Energy production and consumption drifted apart in time. Sauna schedules lost their rhythm, and alongside Pikkukakkonen, a second children’s show emerged at a different time!

# From a Short Verse to the Big Picture – How Does This Connect to VPP?



https://preview.redd.it/8v6nzsg3xpsf1.png?width=2816&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7066c2fcd75634303e9c61da0b795e4e842622

A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a system where energy is stored, transformed, and released under computer control. With an electricity exchange market in play, this intelligence and improved overall efficiency can generate profit. It’s quite complex, but I’ll simplify it so even I can grasp it.Electricity is often cheap at night on the exchange, but who wants to wake up to start the washing machine? Here’s the opportunity: store electricity at night and sell it back during a price spike in the day—or profit from price swings, depending on market conditions. D**emand response is the name of the game.**

# What About an Entire City or Industrial Plant?

The volumes grow, and the phenomena get more complex. Consider a district heating network or power grid: how do they behave, and where can profits or savings be squeezed out? Industry experts, please enlighten me—I’m eager to learn!

I have a huge crush on my colleague. She (35 yo) joined us a year ago and her bf just broke up with her (she told me this months later). We got along well in the team but nothing special. Then we discussed in February that we have the same illness and from that point we started to talk more and deeper. Rarely in messenger but almost everyday in teams or in the office. We got to know each other more (like I mentioned her break up) and we had good fun as I always make her laugh. I was quite happy when she reached out to me during her holiday on messenger (she sent me a pic of her company mobile in her hand while hiking bc she joined our group meeting) bc that was the first time I think when she started the convo out of work (and probably the last one). 

I shifted my focus to an other girl in mid-June to end of July but after the summer holiday season we started to talk again more. Some extra coffee breaks in the office and so on. Side note: after an other colleague left the company, she took his place in the office next to me so we are sitting next to each other in the office days (2x a week). We had great conversations in August so I mentioned that I want to see her outside of work as well but she said no. I accepted it and didn't behaved sad or angry or whatever. I thought that the days would be strange from that point. But we have longer coffee breaks now, we are in a different world from everyone else with our inside jokes (we had many before also), we don't care about the others or their opinion and we still have deep conversations. She doesn't speak about other guys (I know that her break up from last year was heavy for her), she spoke openly about her father who died when she was young (6 yo) after I asked her because I had a feeling about it based on some of our discussions in the past. She knows many things about me, she also knows my future plans, how caring I am and so on... I even started to touch her slightly on the arms or on the shoulders and she haven't had any negative reactions. But (as she was always) in the meantime she is very talkative and positive in one day (either in the office or in teams) but cold on the other day.

  
But it is killing me! I know that a no rarely turns into a yes but I feel a special connection and I think nothing happens by accident. I had a long relationship which I ended because I couldn't be there 100% as this girl really ignited a spark in me. I was searching for a new job in the last few months (not beacuse of her) and now I accepted an offer and resigned here. My notice period is very long so I will be here with her until the end of the year. I told her the news, I saw mixed feelings on her face but she knew that I was searching. 

  
To cut to the chase.... do I have any chance with her? can my leave make her missing me and can she rethink or redefine me? I'm not that kind of guy who play games so if I care about someone, it is very hard not to write her or hang out with her. Realistically I know that this is very rare. On my last working day when she is in the office I will talk to her to have a proper goodbye and for a second I thought that a confession can be a good idea as I expect that she will not reach out to me after my leave.",0,1759419037.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

1nw6xq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1nw6xq8/i_feel_brain_damaged_is_this_normal/,"I feel brain damaged, is this normal?","Hi, I went through a traumatic event about 2 weeks ago \[very very brief rundown: my childhood best friend who I consider actual family attempted suicide\] and even though the most predominant chaos and exhaustion/emotions/etc., has worn off by now, I'm really concerned by new changes that I've literally never experienced before that are still lingering since the event:

1) I've started binge eating. As in, I used to have an order of fries and be full from it, and now I'm ordering two entrees plus beers at every meal. Multiple times I've literally collapsed when I got home because I was in so much pain from how overfull I was. I'm going out to buy coffees and pastries and going out for dinner more than I EVER have before (before now I've always eaten 80% healthy, home cooked meals I made).

2) I can barely speak correctly, words get scrambled all the time and I either make grammar mistakes (e.g., saying ""\[plural\] is,"" ""it were,"" etc.) or swap words around (e.g., one time I tried to say crying badly and I said ""bading cryly.""). I've always been extremely well spoken and my mom drilled PERFECT grammar into my head as a child, so while I may have very occasionally had slip ups from talking too fast in the past, having at least 1-3 of these a day is completely new.

3) I'm just completely losing track of time and sequences of events. Yesterday I went to my parents' house and was sitting on the couch downstairs with my mom, she went upstairs to go use bathroom 1. I *remember* soon after going upstairs to my bedroom, sitting in there for about 20 minutes, then setting my phone down on my bed to go use bathroom 2. When I went back into my room I couldn't find my phone anywhere and asked my mom to call it, after which she said it was downstairs and that I'd been downstairs the whole time. I said, no, you were gone for like thirty minutes, I was hanging out in my room. Apparently it had been about 5 minutes, and I had never gone to my room at all. The entire, extremely potent memory just, appeared out of thin air I guess.

I've been living with my boyfriend for support since everything happened, and I told him I'm scared to move back into my apartment (I live alone) because I don't feel safe with these sorts of mental slips happening, especially losing things, losing track of time, and being confused so easily. He told me these are all normal things everybody struggles with, but I've never experienced ANY of this before -- or at least not nearly on this scale.

I'm going to schedule an appointment with a therapist but I just need to know, is this normal? Will I be ok? I feel like I'm losing my mind, I'm legitimately afraid I'm going to get worse. If anyone has any advice or reassurance it would be incredibly appreciated. I've never gone through anything like this in my life and it's all extremely new and terrifying.",1,1759418931.0,trauma,0,0.99,False

That’s over $100 spent for a $7 drink back. I like the drink, but with continuous price increases and how the rewards system has shifted, it’s getting harder to justify.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nw6qu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nw6qu8/reveal_if_oxiclean_stain_remover_powder_truly/,Reveal if OxiClean Stain Remover Powder Truly Works Wonders,"**Tested Convenience of OxiClean Free Versatile Stain Remover 51524**

Thanks to its well-regarded reputation for tackling stains, I found myself intrigued by the OxiClean Free Versatile Stain Remover 51524. As someone tasked with laundry duties for a house full of active kids and pets, I need solutions that pull their weight. From grimy soccer uniforms to coffee spills on upholstery, this product has certainly had its work cut out for it in my home. After using it nearly every day for a month, I decided to share my experience with both the good points and the less impressive features.

**Packaging and Accessibility**

Right out of the box, the 3-pound container is sizeable but manageable, and the sturdy plastic material keeps the powder well-protected. The lid closes securely, which is a relief because, with curious kids around, I need to store it confidently without worrying about accidental spills. The labeling is thorough, outlining over 100 suggested uses, from laundry booster to multi-surface cleaner. I'll be honest; seeing that many options felt a little overwhelming initially—but impressive nonetheless. Also, the container shape makes it easy to grip even with wet hands, which is helpful when you’re in the middle of laundry chaos.

**Versatility in Action**

The versatility promised by the OxiClean stain remover powder is no exaggeration. From my youngest kid's grass-stained jeans to my partner’s coffee-streaked wool scarf, it handled stains with surprising ease. I experimented with its multi-purpose capabilities, even using it on an old carpet stain and a sticky kitchen counter mess. Following label directions to mix the powder with water was straightforward, and the resulting solution was easy to handle and apply. While it didn’t entirely restore the years-old carpet stain, it certainly lightened it by a noticeable margin. This alone made it feel worth the effort.

**Winning Points**

- Dye-free and perfume-free formula makes it ideal for sensitive skin and safe to use on baby clothes.  
- Tackles a broad range of stains, from fabric to hard surfaces.  
- Easy-to-follow directions, even for non-laundry related cleaning.  
- Effective against tough, set-in stains with minimal scrubbing.

[Check OxiClean Free Versatile Stain Remover 51524 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b005gi8upi/)

**Drawbacks and Challenges**

While it shines in its functions, there are a few hurdles that might be worth considering before purchase. For example, the powder occasionally clumps together when stored in humid conditions, even though the container is tightly sealed. Breaking it apart wasn’t particularly difficult, but it was an added step before use. Moreover, I noticed that while it excelled on natural fabrics, it had less effect on synthetic materials like nylon. Additionally, its versatility can be a bit of a double-edged sword—spending time experimenting with the right solution ratio for repeated household tasks felt slightly tedious.

- Powder can clump in humid environments.  
- Less effective on synthetic fabrics.  
- Requires experimentation for optimal use beyond laundry.  

**Performance Compared to Market Rivals**

In a broader context, comparing this product to competitors like Shout Advanced Gel or Resolve Stain Remover sheds light on its unique strengths. Where this OxiClean stain remover truly excels is its gentle, yet effective formula, allowing a fragrance-free experience rare in the market. Shout Advanced may have a slight lead with easy-to-apply sprays, saving you from mixing, but lacks multi-surface usability. Resolve's stubborn stain capabilities are worth a mention, yet its scent-heavy formula might not work for everyone. In contrast, OxiClean offers a better balance between versatility and user-friendliness, albeit at the cost of an extra step in preparation.

**Cost Efficiency**

Judging the price against its functionality leaves me with a mostly positive impression. This 3-pound container gets plenty of mileage, especially if you’re using it across multiple cleaning needs. Comparable products in this price range rarely provide this level of fabric care coupled with compatibility for hard surfaces. I personally feel the investment justifies itself, not necessarily because it replaces all other cleaning products, but because it significantly reduces the need for a half-dozen individual cleaning solutions. Plus, its oxygen-based formula means I’m not constantly worrying about harsh chemical residues in my home. Is it the absolute cheapest option out there? No, but it offsets the cost by delivering a multi-tasking powerhouse.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

As residence applications open and prospective first years apply for residence, you might notice that for one of your options (Alder and Linden) you can find virtually nothing online about them. I am a current resident and am here to amend that. So, if you’re considering living here, this is the lowdown

Rooms:
All rooms are singles, and they’re (in my opinion) quite nice. They look similar to the bedrooms in most upper year residences. My biggest surprise was the closet, which is significantly larger than I was expecting, so I was very happy about that. Note that the floors in the rooms are carpeted. It can get sweltering on hot days, so bringing a fan is a must 

Bathrooms:
You share your bathroom with one other housemate. It too is pretty nice, with ample counter space at the sink and a bathtub/shower combo. The bathroom is your and your housemate’s responsibility. You must provide a shower curtain, soap, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, everything like that.

Kitchen:
There is a communal kitchen on the first floor. It has two commercial size fridges, two ovens, four sinks, two microwaves, and ample counter space (don’t quote me on my numbers, I’m going off my memory here). It is one of the only rooms that you can actually find a photo of, so that’s nice. If you do move in, mark your territory in the kitchen early. You will generally get a half shelf of the fridge, a cabinet, a small drawer and a large drawer (at least that’s what I got). Everything is marked with people’s names. You can also bring your own appliances like rice cookers, coffee makers, kettles and such. If cooking isn’t your thing, I suggest not living here. If cooking is your thing but some nights you’re just not in the mood, you are right next to Peter Lougheed and can purchase a voluntary meal plan. The food is hit or miss, but from what I’ve heard much better than Lister

Overview:
I, so far, have loved living here. It is much more homey than the larger residence halls, generally quiet, and very close to campus. I’d recommend living here to a friend. Hopefully this post clears some things up and prospective students can know a little bit more about what they’re getting into instead of going in sort of blind like me lol ",1,1759418047.0,uAlberta,0,1.0,False

Two days ago I needed to grab a few things from the store. As I was pulling away from my house I realized I’d forgot my phone… again. It was going to be a short trip so I decided not to go back for it. I went my usual route. As I was turning into the store I noticed a lot of black smoke rising from an intersection I’d went thru a few blocks back. Went ahead and got my stuff and headed back home. 

As I drove towards the intersection where I’d seen the smoke, my heart sank. Emergency vehicles everywhere, fire, and 5 vehicles scattered all over the intersection. I was stuck in traffic so I watched in disbelief the absolute carnage of what minutes before had been just a normal day at a normal intersection. Firefighters were still struggling to get one of the vehicles that was still burning under control. Finally got off on a side road and away from the destruction. Later investigation says a pick up approached at a very high speed and just plowed the cars waiting at the red light. At last count, one dead, 4 critically injured. The fatality was a local off duty fireman married with two kids. It shook me up a bit. Shook me even more to realize if I’d went back and got my phone that could have been me sitting at that intersection. 

Once again I realized that looking after my health, being careful in my endeavors could all mean nothing in a blink of an eye. So that’s why you make sure those you love know it, everyday! And be thankful that you get out of bed each morning even if it hurts and ENJOY LIVING. It’s a precious gift not afforded to everyone.

1nw6i2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nw6i2p,Need advice to make our living room/kitchen complete,"Hi everyone,

We (girlfriend and I) have been working on our apartment and are a bit stuck on how to bring everything together. I’ll add pictures of our living room, kitchen, layoutplan & kitchen inspo for context.

Here are some of our current struggles and doubts:
	•	Dining table / coffee table: not sure what shapes or materials would best balance the space. We were thinking of buying a Darker wooden round eating table, and maybe a more organic shaped, also wooden coffee table? 

	•	Colors: we already have some bold elements (blue sofa, red rug, green dining chairs) but we’re unsure if it’s too much. Should we add new accent colors/materials, or remove one to make it more cohesive? We'd rather not remove the couch or dining chairs though.

	•	Style balance & atmosphere: Right now, I think we have a sort of mid-century modern with an eclectic twist style. We try to aim for a  warm, cozy and playful interior, but also a bit design-y and a little organized. Right now it feels like it’s missing that “finished” or designy look. It's a bit too 'all over' the place


     •    Kitchen: We want to completely renovate the kitchen. The kitchen is in a bit of a darker spot (no windows), so we were thinking of a lighter colour, maybe even white/beige again. As it is one big room, it also needs to match our living room style and colours ofcourse. What do y'all think? 

Any advice, tips, or even specific ideas (colors, materials, furniture shapes, lighting, accessories) would be super appreciated!

Thanks in advance 🙏

I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. 

About a month ago my fiancée bumped into a guy she worked with a couple of years back and they got talking. They text most days now with some voice notes sent back and forth. My fiancée has been saying she wants me to meet him and so we agreed that we would grab a coffee with him the afternoon of the following day. 

She was due to be picking him up after he dropped his car at the mechanics at approx 10am and dropping him back home (he lives literally down the street to us, which is how they ended up bumping into each other). Originally we were due to then immediately go and get coffee in the morning, however I’d been working pretty long days and fancied a lay in so I asked that we could meet in the afternoon instead (I knew she was going to be picking him up still of course). She agreed and we went to sleep, when I woke up she had already left to pick him up. 

I then got a text from her saying that they were back from the mechanics and going to get a coffee together and “feel free to join”. I texted back immediately asking why we weren’t going in the afternoon, however she ignored that and instead texted back about something unrelated. When I asked what she meant, she stopped texting back at all until about an hour or so later she got back home acting as though nothing had happened. 

I’m annoyed because 
1. We had plans in the afternoon and she went and had breakfast with him anyway 
2. She told me once she got in that she had been planning to still have breakfast with him all along, and just didn’t bother mentioning it when I asked to defer to the afternoon
3. She didn’t tell me where they had gone for coffee , so even though she “invited me” I had no way of knowing where to meet them 

I’m feeling a bit jealous and a bit disrespected and I don’t know if I’m overreacting 

TLDR: partner has made a new male friend and went out for breakfast with him behind my back despite us having plans to go out as a 3 that same day ",6,1759417949.0,AIO,10,0.88,False

Holy water, silver bullets, all that crap. That’s not me. I’m not out here to kill anything. I’m out here to find her. Because… well, she has something that belongs to me. My dad. At least I think she does. I’m getting the bulk of my information from my mum, and my mum, she isn’t what people would call a reliable source. She lives in Beacon Point Sanatorium on the edge of Corvus Vale. She says a demon took my dad. But Everyone else says she killed him. That’s why she’s there, that’s why I was taken from her care when I was just a week old, and that’s why I’ve never met my big brother. I could be out there looking for him, trying to find the family I never had. But instead, I’m hunting a demon, because, unlike everyone else, I believe my mum. She told the police a demon took him after a ritual went wrong. Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, I can understand why they think she’s crazy. she told the police this information while standing next to his cold, dead body. I guess you can’t accuse something of taking someone when they are clearly visible on your living-room floor, I get that. But she insisted that this demon took his soul and left his body. That was the moment they stopped calling her an outright killer and started calling the shrink. I’m documenting this here because I need someone to know what I’m doing, even if its just strangers on the internet. I grew up being past from pillar to post in a shitty foster care system, I have no one of real value in my life. If this all goes to shit, I need someone to know…I tried. So, anyway, ill start at the beginning, I guess.  
My name is Alex, Alex Hammond, I was born in Vale central infirmary in 1989. My parents are-…were. Shannon and Jerry Hammond. I don’t know anything about my brother. He was 2 when we were separated.  
I found my Mum recently, after years of not looking. That sounds bad, I know. But if you’re told the same story enough times, it starts to stick. You stop asking questions. For 36 years my mum was a compulsive lying psychotic murderer and that’s all there was to it. School was a cruel place. My life was common knowledge. When I started my new job as a tree surgeon up by hollowthorn forest, it didn’t take long to realise people still knew more about me than I did. “You ever spoke to her then?” Gary, my team leader asked out of the blue one day whilst casually munching on a tuna sandwich. “Spoke to who?” “Your mum mate.” “No, I don’t have a reason to, wouldn’t know where to find her even if I did.” I said, internally rolling my eyes. This line of questioning was something I was accustomed to, but I was hoping I could at least escape it at work. Gary wiped the crumbs that had accumulated in his stubble way with his sleeve, looking at me wide eyed. “Mate... she’s in there” he pointed a meaty finger upward, towards an ancient manor house style building sitting alone nestled amongst the very trees we were working on.

Beacon point isn’t far from my house. Corvus vale isn’t a big town. It’s About a 30-minute walk as the crow flies or a 10-minute drive. It sits just inside hollowstone forest, surrounded by a large stone wall. It’s peaks and chimneys visible from the road. It’s a secure site, The west wing, housed the criminals deemed too mentally unstable for general population, the rest of the building was used as a long-term residential facility for people with severe mental illnesses. White stone signs with polite fonts and little bird logos dotted the long driveway directing visitors. I was going to the west wing. Inside everything smelled like bleach and stale coffee. I didn’t tell anyone I was going. Who would I tell. I signed the visitor sheet with a pen that didn’t work until it did. The receptionist barely glanced in my direction. “Who are you here to see?” “Shannon Hammond.” She Paused and looked up. “I’m sorry Hammond is on family only visitation, and she doesn’t have any family” “I’m her son.” That got me a look. Not a kind one. More like really? I fished out my wallet and slid my ID across the desk. She didn’t pick it up. Her eyes ping ponged from the card to my face and back too many times before she sighed and printed me a badge. After an agonising wait, she buzzed me through. “Follow the lines” she said matter-of-factly. “Yellow to the visiting suit, red to the reading room, green to the lunch hall, ignore the black” “Ignore the black?” I echoed “yeah...” My trainers squeaked on the over polished floor as I followed a yellow line painted beneath them. I counted doors to stop my hands from shaking; I was so nervous. I felt as though I had shifted back in time, to the fourteen-year-old me, clutching a bin liner full of clothes outside yet another stranger’s door with a social worker telling me to be brave.

Mum sat facing away from me, at a table with edges rounded down to nothing. she staired vacantly out of the window as I sat opposite her. Her hands folded like she was waiting for church. She looked older than the picture I had. Of course she did. She had to be in at least her early sixties now. Her hair was completely grey; she’d tried to brush it neat. Her eyes met mine slowly. “Hello,” she said, softly. “Hi.” Silence fell into the space between us and had to be pushed aside. “I brought you something.” I didn’t know why I said that. I hadn’t. But I wanted to. Fruit. A magazine. A miracle. She smiled anyway. “You brought me you.” “I’m Alex,” I said, which was stupid. She knew that. But I needed to say it out loud. I needed it to be true in the air, not just in a file. “I know,” she said. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t cry. She had the tired control of someone who has learned what crying costs in places like this. For a minute we talked about nothing. The Weather. My job. My favourite food. Then it all wanted to pour out. The questions. But I didn’t know how to open that door without everything falling through the floor. She did it for me. “You look like your father” she said, quietly. A tinge of fear shot up my spine. For a moment I had visions of her lunging at me from across the table. I stayed quiet and forced a thin smile. “Do you see him?” she asked. “Who?” “your father.” I stared at her, confused. I started to think id made a huge mistake in coming here. She was clearly deranged. She saw the puzzled look on my face and started to elaborate. She smiled, “Do you see a bird? Strange looking fellow. You wouldn’t miss it if you saw.”

My mouth went dry. “Sometimes,” I said. “There’s a weird one that sits on my window. It’s probably got a nest” “What makes him weird?”. “He a crow but he’s white” I said flatly. She nodded like we were finally talking about something that mattered. “That’s your dad,” she said. Certain. I laughed. A small, ugly sound. “spiritually speaking” I said not knowing if it was a question or a statement. “No, literally speaking” I raised an eyebrow. This was as good of an opening as I was going to get. “How?” I hated how much I needed that word. She turned her hands palm up on the table, like showing me she had nothing hidden. “I’ve waited thirty-six years for a chance to tell you the truth Alex. Let me start from the beginning” She sat back in her chair, the hard, cheap plastic clicking under the strain.

“We wanted a child,” she said. “But the doctors said no. There was an incident when your father was young, he needed emergency surgery to repair an abdominal hernia but there was an accident, both vas deferens were severely damaged during the surgery leaving them scared beyond repair. No one knew. Not until it was too late.” “I don’t know what those words mean” I replied honestly. “His balls didn’t work” “oh...” I looked away embarrassed. She half smirked before continuing. “Your father wanted a child of his own so badly, he searched high and low for an answer” “I thought I had a brother.” I interrupted “Didn’t he already have a child of his own?” “This was before your brother” she stated before continuing. “He found a book, in a dusty old shop in town. Started studying the occult” “What?” “Yes, that was exactly my reaction when he told me too.” She agreed. “But it worked” “What worked?” I asked cautiously. “The summoning spell” she whispered. I’d heard enough I couldn’t believe I just sat though that. She was clearly deranged. I started to stand; she reached for my wrist stopping me dead. An icy chill running up my spine. “Please Alex, just hear me.” Her eyes were pleading. “If at the end you never want to return, I will understand but please, let me finish.” I sat down slowly. If only to get her to release me. She stroked my wrist once with her thumb before removing her hands and straightening her faded pink scrubs. “I didn’t take part in the ritual, he did that on his own, but I know it worked. I got pregnant.” “With my brother?” “yes” she smiled.

“It wasn’t until I read the book later that I discovered there was a price to pay. The price differs with every request, depending on what you need granted.” “What was your price” I asked leaning forward slightly. “Any subsequent children must be given to her” “What?!” I stammered “I’m a subsequent child... I..I... mean I’m a subsequent child!” “I know,” she murmured, her gaze dropping to the floor in shame. “It was never meant to be this way. After your father told me what the price would be, we promised each other that we wouldn’t have another child. We tried, truly we did.” She looked up at me, her eyes full of desperation, silently begging me to believe her sincerity. “You’d think it would be simple, not getting pregnant, but…” her voice faltered, “…she always finds a way.” “What way?” I asked “It doesn’t matter now, what matters is you were born, and we loved you. Your father loved you.” “What happened to my dad Shannon?” I couldn’t bring myself to call her mum. At this point I was still quite sure Beacon Point Sanatorium was the best place for her.

I could see this caused her pain, but I was done listening to stories. She continued regardless “She made a mistake. The deal your dad made was between him and her. For the ritual to work in her favour we both had to be present at the summoning so that I could agree to the terms. But I wasn’t.” “Then what happened” I muttered half-heartedly. “The fortune teller that give your father the book helped us. She knew a spell; she helped us rewrite the terms. Sort of like a cosmic solicitor” she chuckled dryly. “This isn’t funny” I shot back “you killed my dad! I’ve grown up alone Shannon!” She slammed her palm on the table shocking my tears away. “It’s because of that man you got to grow up at all!” she growled. “He sacrificed his life for you! He took your place!” “Yeah. And what...? now he’s a fucking bird!?” She settled back into her seat. Resigned “she gave me a solid story. But I chose the truth.” “What!?” I stammered, exasperated. “Find Morrigan.” She whispered, defeated. “She will give you what you’re looking for” Her shoulders sagged as if the weight of the years finally pressed her down, the fight gone from her eyes. I stared at her, the words settling uneasily between us, thickening the air with a grief that tasted almost metallic. I wanted to scream, to demand sense from her rambling, but something in her expression, some fractured hope, kept me silent. Shannon no longer looked like stranger spinning tales; she looked like someone who had lost everything and was begging for a chance to make things right. The clock in the hallway ticked on, indifferent to the ruins she’d laid before me, and I realised that whether I wanted it or not, the story wasn’t finished. [Not yet.](https://youtu.be/QRy-gJSkOs0)",1,1759417944.0,Midnightcreepypasta0,0,1.0,False

1nw6f94,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFreshmen/comments/1nw6f94/whats_meaning_of_human_life/,what's meaning of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

(It’s funny because I was officially diagnosed this year in my mid-30s) Like so many, I have a habit of picking up hobbies and putting them down never to be done again, but with knitting it was and is SO SO different. Knitting touches something in my brain: I just feel so good and it helps me concentrate whether it's a movie, show, lecture, sermon, or just keeping me as close to the present as possible. Or I can daydream if I want 😆 I take it with me to coffee shops, hang with friends or waiting for an appointment. 

All I know is that knitting helps calm my anxiety and scratches the deep parts in my brain where I feel a sense of pleasure, accomplishment, creativity, and optimism whether I finish a piece or not! Just wanted to share if you’re looking for your next hobby! FYI: it became automatic after a several months to a year of consistent practice.

Not sure if this is the place to share this. Last night I streamed for 8 hours. I started a a fresh world with the intent to beat hardcore in one stream. I am a casual streamer not even close to a good streamer. But I enjoy streaming because it helps thinking I am streaming to people. I had a great time beating the game with minimal enchants. I had doubts but I stayed focused and everything worked out. There were a couple coffee breaks and the stream was quiet since my roommates were sleeping. The 8 hour run is a great guide on how to approach hardcore and beating the game without needing full netherite while still being safe. 
There was no base setup I lived with the villagers and we coexisted. The only villager trading I did was for some arrows before I fought the dragon. Bundles were a great help in inventory management. 
It feels great to set a goal for myself and accomplish it. 
If you want to check out the stream it’s @cosmicgiggle on twitch. 
I would greatly appreciate it! 
And I would love it if you guys would share some of your achievements and some ideas for me for the future. ",3,1759417706.0,PlayCozyMC,0,1.0,False

It has a lot going for it but it never comes together in the way the filmmakers intended. It’s the cinematic equivalent of visiting a curio shop while on vacation–there are plenty of interesting things to look at but nothing worth buying. The movie is very much less the sum of its parts, despite the beauty of several scenes and the overall craftsmanship on display. Together, however, it’s a well-intentioned misfire.

The problems begin with Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie, two actors the camera adores but exhibit little chemistry for each other in this movie. They did manage to hold my attention because they are movie stars, born with that undeniable magnetism that makes them watchable no matter what they’re doing on screen. Even though Farrell and Robbie nail all of the varying emotional states the movie asks of them, they can’t overcome the movie’s severe case of tonal whiplash.

On a visual level, Kogonada delivers one perfectly-framed scene after another. This might be one of the best-looking films I’ll see this year. (Although films viewed as failures are rarely recognized, cinematographer Benjamin Loeb deserves to be.) Whenever Kogonada isn’t mooning over Farrell and Robbie, he gives us breathtaking views of the California terrain, with tree lined roads, quaint walk-ups, coffee shops, and so on. There are times when the movie adopts a painterly aesthetic, dabbling in surrealism, impressionism and other art forms. The film is a feast for the eyes. Even Farrell and Robbie’s costumes are perfect.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard Farrell, Robbie and Kononada try, nothing in the movie gels. This is due to how the story is structured. Having two characters simultaneously explore the formative moments from their childhood that left them scarred emotionally takes away from both. The dialog is overly verbose, perhaps striving for the rhythm of a film from the Forties. Whatever the intent, it sounds out of place in a modern world.

Despite presenting itself as a romantic comedy, the movie is only fleetingly interested in being either. For the most part, the movie is a serious emotional drama, an examination of two people who can’t experience love. Aside from the dramatic moments, every other tone the movie reaches for feels off. The whimsy is forced, the romance timid and the comedy mild. The movie’s sweet-spot is its therapy-influenced sequences, which are effective but never build towards an emotional release.

*A Big, Bold, Beautiful Journey* fails because its story is neither cohesive nor captivating. However, if you’re curious and have time on your hands, the movie creates a beautiful world for Margo Robbie and Colin Farrell to wander through at their peak handsomeness. **Not Recommended**.

I told them (24M) it would never work between us due to our conflicting attachment styles. They brushed it off and continued talking so I thought we were on the same page.

A few days later they started talking about their sexual experience, shared their body count and said they weren’t good at sex. I brushed it off by saying something along the lines of “practice makes perfect”. They said that they were offended by that because now they felt like I thought they weren’t good at sex. I told them that that wasn’t what I meant. They gave me examples of Jay and Gloria from Modern family. I told them we were just friends and we talked it out. They started sharing stories about their previous hookups and said they were just being platonic. I asked them if we were good and they said that depended on if I thought they’d be good at sex. I called them out again but they said they were trying to diffuse the situation. Anyway, we moved past that.

I’ll shortly be traveling to a city in their state and their first response was asking if I could meet up for coffee. I told them I would be busy and they said they were just just kidding and they weren’t even going to be in that city. I asked them what they would’ve done if I had said yes instead.

They say that it’s going to be a “platonic meet up date”, that they only want to meet me because they think I’m a very interesting person so much so that they want to “fMRI” my brain, and I don’t believe them because I get hit on a lot.

(Guess the lyrics of what song this is.)

What might be good for your heart
Might not be good for my head
And what was there at the start
Might not be there in the end

Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better
Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better

(Guess the lyrics of another song as well by the same band.)

How could I already lose my way like this?
Drowning in burning bright abyss
Even at stratospheric depths
This vertigo of bliss

Oh and I
I used to know myself
Oh and you
You used to know me well
Oh and I
I wish that I could leave myself alone
Oh and you
You wish that you could make me whole

This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time. However, you must enjoy the Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

I will say though before deleting the mobile app off my phone Friday, that this subreddit has really helped me get through sad, tough hard times, with sadness because of heartbreak, just not feeling the best about myself and over all it's good to know that people on this subreddit do understand me, where I feel I don't understand if I truthfully belong anywhere. While my previous post yeah, only a few people only messaged me and I didn't have a lot of chat request, and what came out of that was I did make two bestie friends off of this subreddit which I'm glad, because times have been tough for me lately, I'm just really struggling with accepting myself and accepting this heartbreak of myself. I really didn't expect that I would be bothered and sad not being loved, even if it's just a loving friendship kind of way. In a sense of it all, that's why I'm deleting the mobile app off my phone, I'm just too overwhelmed with my thoughts and emotions. I just need to get off of Reddit and stop seeing introduction posts, scrolling and looking at things, and just set my phone on the end table, collect my collective thoughts, find a way to self-heal again, to find the need to self-heal on the fact that I'm the one that pushes my friends away because I just can't even trust my best friends to get too close to me because I'm afraid of the outcome if I do just that of it all, I just need a time of reflection and I need the time to self-heal from feeling not loved, even though my two besties that I made off of this subreddit would tell me that's not true and I wouldn't believe it with the state of how my mind is thinking currently.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should state that the kind of person I am, I connect with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most days I'm in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music;

Beyond friendship, I'm unable to understand why a romantic partner if I'm even datable which currently I don't think I'm ever dateable with how I'm and I've developed a brand nickname I've given myself as Loveless, because that's just how I feel that I'm and that I'm unable to identify and comprehend what that is like to enjoy someone's physical attraction to be happy in a relationship.

It's also something I'm highly uncomfortable accepting to be physically loved, physically attracted/admiration of how I look and I don't want that kind of connection, it's so bothersome to me and I can't identify how someone prefers a physical connection to connect with someone. It's just not in my interest bucket lists of what I would want in a relationship. 

I'm also simply and truthfully unable to understand how photographs and selfie exchanges make a relationship grow between one another. I don't even know how this makes a bond or a connection and I'll never be able to understand even if this is explained by my partner. I've had ex-partners trying to explain that connections are stronger if physical exchanges of photographs are exchanged frequently. I'm not that type of person. I'm sorry. 

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server.

Updates on the Discord server and recaps.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.

Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say, that  from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

Showdowns always bring more variance since the player pool is smaller and lineups tend to overlap, but hopefully this gives you another angle to work with.

First time doing any design so feel free to roast.

Looking to put on an addition (25' x 33') and redoing most of the inside of the house.Looking to add 1 more bedroom (guest) and move master to the opposite side of the house. 

That requires moving current 2nd bedroom at rear of the house to the front.

Current master will be changed to living space with walk-in closet becoming part of an expanded mudroom/laundry.

Area to front of island (with seating) will become a dining room with a big table (not shown currently).

Would like to add coffee bar/breakfast bar either in pantry or possibly inset the new bathroom wall so cabinets can go there and be flush with kitchen wall and not impede traffic around the island.

Bays have to stay in new living area/kitchen (kitchen has door to deck) due to windows/roof.

Hallway will be added to connect all of the bedrooms/new bath/master in the addition space to the rest of the house.

Has walk out basement so 2 stories of new addition, haven't finalized basement plans at this point.

A concern I have is removing most of the current exterior wall for new bath/closet. 

Can probably shift closet to right and have deeper guest bath but master bath would require part of the wall to be removed as currently designed.

Going for modern/Scandinavian style open concept.

This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time. However, you must enjoy the Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

I will say though before deleting the mobile app off my phone Friday, that this subreddit has really helped me get through sad, tough hard times, with sadness because of heartbreak, just not feeling the best about myself and over all it's good to know that people on this subreddit do understand me, where I feel I don't understand if I truthfully belong anywhere. While my previous post yeah, only a few people only messaged me and I didn't have a lot of chat request, and what came out of that was I did make two bestie friends off of this subreddit which I'm glad, because times have been tough for me lately, I'm just really struggling with accepting myself and accepting this heartbreak of myself. I really didn't expect that I would be bothered and sad not being loved, even if it's just a loving friendship kind of way. In a sense of it all, that's why I'm deleting the mobile app off my phone, I'm just too overwhelmed with my thoughts and emotions. I just need to get off of Reddit and stop seeing introduction posts, scrolling and looking at things, and just set my phone on the end table, collect my collective thoughts, find a way to self-heal again, to find the need to self-heal on the fact that I'm the one that pushes my friends away because I just can't even trust my best friends to get too close to me because I'm afraid of the outcome if I do just that of it all, I just need a time of reflection and I need the time to self-heal from feeling not loved, even though my two besties that I made off of this subreddit would tell me that's not true and I wouldn't believe it with the state of how my mind is thinking currently.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should state that the kind of person I am, I connect with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most days I'm in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music;

Beyond friendship, I'm unable to understand why a romantic partner if I'm even datable which currently I don't think I'm ever dateable with how I'm and I've developed a brand nickname I've given myself as Loveless, because that's just how I feel that I'm and that I'm unable to identify and comprehend what that is like to enjoy someone's physical attraction to be happy in a relationship.

It's also something I'm highly uncomfortable accepting to be physically loved, physically attracted/admiration of how I look and I don't want that kind of connection, it's so bothersome to me and I can't identify how someone prefers a physical connection to connect with someone. It's just not in my interest bucket lists of what I would want in a relationship. 

I'm also simply and truthfully unable to understand how photographs and selfie exchanges make a relationship grow between one another. I don't even know how this makes a bond or a connection and I'll never be able to understand even if this is explained by my partner. I've had ex-partners trying to explain that connections are stronger if physical exchanges of photographs are exchanged frequently. I'm not that type of person. I'm sorry. 

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server.

Updates on the Discord server and recaps.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.

Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say, that  from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

The Summit Brands 33008U Dryel At-Home Dry Cleaner Starter Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to maintain special fabrics and dry-clean-only clothes without shelling out cash at professional cleaners. Using it felt surprisingly simple, and I immediately appreciated that it worked in just 20 minutes. No bag is required, which makes it even more convenient. This product isn’t just for clothes either; I got curious and decided to test it on some sheer curtains and throw pillows – worked like a charm! It's especially great for fabrics like silk and wool, which I’m always scared to ruin.  

**Check [Summit Brands 33008U] price on Amazon.**  

The wrinkle-release spray is a delightful add-on, helping keep clothes looking smooth and static-free between washes. The included stain-removal pen worked well for smaller blemishes – though, admittedly, it didn’t fully remove a stubborn coffee stain on a linen shirt of mine. The fresh fragrance from the cleaning sheets left my garments smelling like they’d spent a day at a luxurious spa instead of tumbling around in my old dryer. This kit cleans up to 8 loads, managing 40 garments total, which felt like a fair number given its claims.  

**Uses and Versatility**  

Laundry day felt far less stressful after switching to this kit. Its gentleness on delicate fabrics like linen, silk, and wool stood out. My wife had this bright silk scarf she hadn’t dared clean in months; this kit made it look renewed. The no-shrink promise is a godsend if, like me, you're traumatically familiar with “shrunk-wash disasters.” From blouses to jeans, it handled everything with consistent results. Surprisingly, I even used it to refresh an old denim jacket, and it didn’t dull the fabric or its bold color.  

**Benefits**   

- Quick and easy process: Takes only 20 minutes.  
- Truly versatile: Works on delicate fabrics like silk and strong ones like denim.  
- Add-ons: Stain removal pen and wrinkle spray make the experience more convenient.  
- Cost-effective compared to professional dry cleaning.  

**Shortcomings**  

- Struggles with deeply-set or old stains like coffee or wine.  
- Heavily wrinkled clothes may require additional steaming post-dry cycle.  

Fits Easily into Tight Schedules  

Using simple, dryer-activated sheets, this kit merges convenience with efficiency. Watching it tackle smelly T-shirts and refresh my work blazers without any complicated steps was satisfying. It’s a blessing for those last-minute “I have no clean clothes, and I have a meeting in an hour” moments. Dry-clean-only care no longer feels like a nightmare chore or wallet-drainer.  

**Care Beyond Clothing**  

Exploration of the product’s versatility was fun. Turned out, it could refresh items like throw blankets and pillow covers. In retrospect, it saved me a few dollars on dry-cleaning those bulky items professionals usually overcharge for. I do feel the product could be slightly tweaked for larger fabric pieces, but for smaller household textiles, it’s fantastic.  

**Drawbacks**  

- Larger items like curtains can be tricky – one round didn’t always feel sufficient.  
- Takes ample patience; immediate results for tough smells might require additional attempts.  

Competing Brands  

Looking at alternatives like Woolite’s dry-cleaning kit, I noticed Dryel had a certain efficiency in tackling smaller loads. Woolite boasts a gentle cleaning formula but lacks Dryel’s faster processing time and add-ons like the wrinkle-release spray. However, the competition edges slightly ahead in handling heavier odors. Another rival is Swash’s clothing care products, which maintain a specialty focus on odor removal but at a steeper cost and minimal versatility on delicate fabrics.  

**Bang for the Buck**  

Cost efficiency plays to this kit’s strengths. I calculated the savings against professional dry-cleaning fees, and it’s safe to say the margin is substantial. No exact numbers here, though, since prices swing up and down, but Dryel undeniably feels like a smart option if dry-cleaning bills pile up too often for you.

 I have been making soaps for years, and this is the first time I have encountered this. It is also the first time I am working with coffee instead of wster.

I made this soap in two phases:

**First phase:**
- Coconut oil: 208 grams
- Olive oil: 138.5 grams
- Sodium hydroxide: 52 grams
- Coffee: 114 grams

I waited for the temperature to drop to 50 degrees Celsius, combined everything, separated 200 grams of the base, and colored it, then poured the rest.

In the meantime, I had already weighed the second phase:
- Coconut oil: 49 grams
- Olive oil: 33 grams
- Sodium hydroxide: 12 grams
- Coffee: 26 grams

The temperature of this was at 35 degrees Celsius.

Between each layer, I sprayed a little alcohol to help them stick together. In the end, I didn't cover the soap because it was at 22 degrees Celsius (weather), and I didn't want it to overheat. I used a silicone mold. I didn't use any fragrance.
Oh, I cut it after 6 hours that I made it.

**Problems I noticed:**
1. When I made the first cut, I noticed that the white layer wanted to separate from the rest; I simply pressed it to see if it would stick as it dried. It got sticked.
2. Secondly, the last layer started to ""crumb"" when I made the cut; I changed knives, which helped a bit, but at the bottom, it still crumbles.
3. For some reason that I still don't understand, it gelled.

Can you help me?

I just opened the fridge and as I was opening it, I asked my daughter about her schoolwork and took out a carton of pre-made iced coffee.  I put the carton on the counter and I refilled a glass cup I had been drinking from. I distinctly remember pouring it into the glass, feeling of the cold liquid hitting the glass cup and I put the iced carton back in the fridge and closed it and headed to my room.  I then didn't have the cup in my hand and returned to it nearly empty by my bedside. Even my daughter remembers me re-filling the cup but there's no evidence it was ever refilled.

This Discord server is also for introverts, NEETs, and people with social anxiety looking for a very quiet and still Discord server for the vast majority of the time. However, you must enjoy the Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

I thought I should give a general idea about what the Discord server is looking for because this Discord server is also a way to help me make online friends off of Reddit, I also want to give a recap/some updates about the Discord server before I delete the mobile app off my phone in a day or two and take a break from Reddit (I don't know when I'll be back and I really can't answer that when I'll be back. I'm not even certain that I will redownload the app on my mobile phone again) Keep a reminder that I will not be turning off my chat request till another 24 hours or 42 hours around there then  you can just send me a chat request until these hours appear on the post when I'll be turning off my chat requests.

I will say though before deleting the mobile app off my phone Friday, that this subreddit has really helped me get through sad, tough hard times, with sadness because of heartbreak, just not feeling the best about myself and over all it's good to know that people on this subreddit do understand me, where I feel I don't understand if I truthfully belong anywhere. While my previous post yeah, only a few people only messaged me and I didn't have a lot of chat request, and what came out of that was I did make two bestie friends off of this subreddit which I'm glad, because times have been tough for me lately, I'm just really struggling with accepting myself and accepting this heartbreak of myself. I really didn't expect that I would be bothered and sad not being loved, even if it's just a loving friendship kind of way. In a sense of it all, that's why I'm deleting the mobile app off my phone, I'm just too overwhelmed with my thoughts and emotions. I just need to get off of Reddit and stop seeing introduction posts, scrolling and looking at things, and just set my phone on the end table, collect my collective thoughts, find a way to self-heal again, to find the need to self-heal on the fact that I'm the one that pushes my friends away because I just can't even trust my best friends to get too close to me because I'm afraid of the outcome if I do just that of it all, I just need a time of reflection and I need the time to self-heal from feeling not loved, even though my two besties that I made off of this subreddit would tell me that's not true and I wouldn't believe it with the state of how my mind is thinking currently.

What I'm seeking further offline off of Reddit when I delete the app off my phone, keep a reminder that I'm not asking for offline Redditors to keep me company for those 24 or 42 hours that I will be online, I don't currently and I'll never currently seek something like that, that would do more harm than good That isn't subject to change either, I'll never want temporary contacts, just to make me feel a sense of false love from friendship, I want the connection to be real and not so much falsified of it all.

However this is important to understand that I'm simply and truthfully not looking for a quick and easy temporary contact within those 24 or 42 hours, I'm also just not looking for someone to message me for 24 and 42 hours then up and leave. The type of  connections that want to send me a chat request, understand that I'm looking for someone that is interested in texting me bya day-by-day basis and have the time to send a handful or a lot of text messages throughout the day on Discord (obviously everyone here knows that I don't do voice calls and I randomly send voice clips when I get the motivation to send them, and I don't want to be awkward, distracting, and embarrassing and embarrass myself on a video phone call instead.)

I should state that the kind of person I am, I connect with people through expressive text messages and expressive text messages from Redditors that are able to have expressive text messages through a lot of collective thoughts and to be able to have a lot of random conversations. Most days I'm in and out of being dissociative, listening to the beat and the vibe of the music that I get lost in the expressive art of music;

Beyond friendship, I'm unable to understand why a romantic partner if I'm even datable which currently I don't think I'm ever dateable with how I'm and I've developed a brand nickname I've given myself as Loveless, because that's just how I feel that I'm and that I'm unable to identify and comprehend what that is like to enjoy someone's physical attraction to be happy in a relationship.

It's also something I'm highly uncomfortable accepting to be physically loved, physically attracted/admiration of how I look and I don't want that kind of connection, it's so bothersome to me and I can't identify how someone prefers a physical connection to connect with someone. It's just not in my interest bucket lists of what I would want in a relationship. 

I'm also simply and truthfully unable to understand how photographs and selfie exchanges make a relationship grow between one another. I don't even know how this makes a bond or a connection and I'll never be able to understand even if this is explained by my partner. I've had ex-partners trying to explain that connections are stronger if physical exchanges of photographs are exchanged frequently. I'm not that type of person. I'm sorry. 

I excel in conversations that are an expressive art of emotional connection and emotional bonding with friends that are all related to that bonding with music or hyper-fixations of hobbies.

I'm also only seeking online friendships currently and I'm not interested in meeting anyone in real life this year due to my living conditions and my living conditions will change within a year or two from now.

Well enough of that and let's just go to another subject about the recap for the Discord server.

Updates on the Discord server and recaps.

Recap and new things about the Discord server and how the Discord server plays Skyrim.

Your music taste must enjoy Lorna Shore, Sleep Token, and AngelMaker style of genre of music.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha.

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety.

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me.

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's already a spooky season, and Halloween will be right around the corner eventually and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?'

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety.

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary.

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing.

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night.

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile.

Where will you be since you're deleting the Reddit app from your mobile phone, anywhere else besides Discord? Telegram or Signal?

I don't know that answer, currently the only app I've on my phone is Discord and I don't know if I'll get a text messaging app to text my friends or partner if I become burnt out of Discord and only will have the Discord app on my Windows desktop to check the notifications if something pops up from the Discord server, if this happens I will make an update somewhere on the appropriate hashtag on the Discord server itself.

However for now, the Discord app is on my phone and I'm just tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break.

Yeah I can say, that  from what I can gather how people are enjoying this Discord server, a lot of people have felt relaxed in this Discord server (in the past we had some drama happen in the Discord server, which I will not bring there and you can read my highly important pinned post, obviously there is a reason why those post are pinned to begin with.) However, other than that people enjoy how relaxed this Discord server is. Many people just wait to post band recommendations, lyrics videos, anything music related and cute pictures of people's pets, and sometimes a random bird photo will drop for people that want to take pictures of wildlife animals from their backyard or someone decided to post a random a random picture of a bird and decided to drop it there, which is fine if that's what people want to do. Adding the cuteness factor to the Discord server is what we want and, as I previously stated already, we need to add the spook factor by adding cute crows and ravens from your backyard!

What do friends think or partners think of matching phone cases and band stickers? Obviously the stickers will be Lorna Shore and Sleep Token obviously, haha. I'm also talking about if a friend or a partner of mine would enjoy matching a teal phone case or a cherry pattern phone case design to match, I think that's a cute idea! However, I know it's probably very hard to get a phone case because of very old phone models and one of my friends told me that TeePublic and Redbubble aren't shipping internationally anymore, which sucks! Speaking of international, I don't care if you're international! Even if I'm from the U.S. and if you've legitimate REAL cool/awesome vibes, then I want to get to know you!

This is how the Discord server owner plays Skyrim.

Skyrim updates.

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game? You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny glitches. However, this seemed interesting to me, and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel. The vampires would be after me constantly, and I was annoyed.

What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quests I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I didn't have any more, and obviously the save file was gone. My favorite style was blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal.

However, using a crossbow is very deadly, and surprisingly, I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4. I'm also a Stormcloak, obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there are a bunch of NPCs talking about high praise for the Imperials, and it's just getting me to think, ""You're about as annoying as Nazeem,"" and every single time I go to Whiterun, here he goes with his famous Cloud District post. I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak, though. However, it's no wonder why people want to kill Nazeem; he's literally annoying.

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear with my newry, and I'll also not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept combat level mode because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself while mildly handicapping myself on the game, and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I have a tank follower with high experience in block, heavy gear, and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment; however, I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim, as I've always done double enchantments on my gear and my jewelry. I've also never done any elemental protection on my gear before, and I never did a 1-enchantment handicap on my gear and my jewelry.

What are you looking for in the Discord server? Are you looking for offline Redditors to help you with the Discord server? As a Discord owner do you need any assistance with anything that a offline Redditor can help you with? We also need to know what the Discord server icon is about and the Discord server title, what is that about?

Who is that on the Discord server icon? That's Will Ramos excited to eat something that made him pass out, damn the food must've been THAT good. I may/might change the Discord server's icon to Will Ramos's sigil name that's posted on my Reddit page (not my image, and I don't claim it's my image.) Will Ramos posted that on his social media when FB allowed you to click on images and save them without logging in. However, I'm having issues with that now, and oddly, I can't look at reels anymore without logging in. That's why I'm asking for others to help post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token newsfeeds on the correct hashtags on the Discord server. We're also looking for Discord members that want to occasionally post Lorna Shore and Sleep Token memes, which are welcomed in the correct hashtags to be posted. Obviously the Discord title name is obviously taken from a Lorna Shore song lyric, which most of the Redditors reading this probably expected just as much as that, haha.

After a bunch of late nights and way too much coffee, I ended up with something that actually works: an AI book generator that creates custom books on literally any topic you feed it.

I’ve been testing it with friends (one made a “Dad jokes survival guide,” another did “AI investing 101”), and the results have been pretty wild.

My best friend’s father is terminally ill and has \~ 2- 4 weeks before passing away in New Mexico, he has lived a long full life over his 90 years.  My friend is an only-child and not very computer savvy. She knows I work on PowerPoint for my job, and asked me to help her create a life story memorial that mostly chronicles her father’s life from a young age to his golden years. She plans on showing a 5-10 minute video during the ceremony. I was happy to help, but this task is harder than I thought it would be.

She has lots of screenshots and pictures-of-pictures in her memorial photo folder, with almost 150 photos.  The sort by date using the photo’s date field is not helpful at all.  I started sorting these manually, but it is harder than I thought, and taking more time than I have allocated.

What advice do you have for families who want to sort photos by the deceased’s age in large photo sets?  Is there a website or best practice here?  Or, should I grab another cup of coffee and keep shuffling photos.

I suggested random order and she was not too excited about that idea…

Any advice or encouragement is appreciated - TY

Later on he pulls up next to me spazzing about it, "" YOU ALWAYS PULL OUT IN FRONT OF PEOPLE?!?!?!""

""I pull into empty lanes! I have a dashcam. Calm the fuck down (that probably didn't help). "" So he starts up again and I just gun it away and get away from him.

Now I'm like...did I do something wrong? He didn't have a signal on that he was coming over into the slow lane for that offramp at lower right of picture. The point where he started yelling at me was WAAAAAAY down the road.

I’m the newest voice on the account, but the teammates you’ll meet inside our platform never rage-quit, never lag, and never roll for initiative on Monday morning.  
They’re NPCs—Non-Player Colleagues—now on your payroll.  
  
**What we do:**  
**AVOI** builds voice & vision agents that accept the quest the second you think of “Hire.” Need a multilingual receptionist who can also read QR codes at 3 a.m.? Quest accepted. Want a shelf-stocker that crit-loots defective SKUs with 99.9 % accuracy? Also accepted. Zero coffee, zero cooldown, zero PTO.  
  
**Why “NPCs”?**  
Because LLMs aren’t cuddly pets you train—they’re side-characters you promote. Give them a quest log (your SOPs), a name tag, and they’ll farm XP for your KPIs while you sleep. No RNG, no respawn timers.  
  
**The recent patch notes of AI:**  
While everyone else theory-crafted Sora-2 vs Claude-4.5, we shipped voice agents that can crit-hit a defective widget in <50ms response time. No patch notes megathreads—just live servers.  
  
**One quick drop:**  
Early raids cut average handle time by 38 % and boosted after-hours conversion by 52 %.   
Translation: the NPCs farm more gold than they cost before the first billing cycle.  
  
**Future feels real:**  
We’re starting with ears and eyes, but other senses are already in the DLC roadmap. If you’re building in retail, logistics, or any raid where “always-on” used to mean “always-overtime,” come talk to us.

1nw5k1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1nw5k1p/i_dont_pursue_a_relationship_with_my_fathers_wife/,I don't pursue a relationship with my father's wife after he passed,"Hello reddit,

I know this post might paint me in a negative light, but I just need to vent since I can’t really share my exact feelings with anyone in my life. 

&nbsp; 

My parents got divorced when I was 5 (nearly six), and my younger sisters were 4 and 1. Initially my mother secured an apartment in the same village and we stayed there, but eventually we moved to greener pastures in a bigger city. 

We were supposed to see my dad every other weekend and on most holidays, but that didn’t always work out since his job involved a lot of travel (he took that job right before I was born, btw). My dad was a war veteran, and his life was shaped by trauma and severe untreated PTSD. Which he coped with by constantly cheating, to like an insane extent, which caused his divorce with my mother and put a strain on his relationship with his wife for the last few years (but I only learned of it after he passed). 

For a few years everything remained normal, and nothing really notably changed since my parents were together. 

Eventually my dad started dating, and there was a bit of a revolving door of women, though we rarely met them face to face. But then something did change, I met one who stuck around, for this post, I’ll call her Lisa.

Lisa was uptight, stressed, and sometimes aggressive, though she could be funny when she had the energy. At first, that was rare, and I remember us privately calling her a witch (we were little assholes).

Over time though, Lisa’s presence really helped my sisters. They had always struggled with my dad’s short fuse and irritability, and having her around gave them another adult to turn to when they were upset or worried about his temper.

But for me it wasn't as important since my dad's problems never bothered me to the same extent, although I couldn't tell you why. Also the fact that we were both ""men"" meant that it was easier for him to relate and do stuff with me (I think). 

But again we established a new homeostasis for the next few years. My sisters would be feel a lot better about visiting my dad, and Lisa relaxed a bit, which made her far more humorous (it is worth to add that I continued to call her witch much later than my sisters). 

&nbsp; 

The turning point came when my dad was diagnosed with cancer. Specifically leukemia in the marrow of his spine.

Through all of it, Lisa was a trooper. She supported my dad and helped him through treatment, and he managed to hold on for another 4-5 years before passing in late 2019.

&nbsp; 

Now I’m in this weird situation where everyone expects me to be super close to Lisa, since she was in my life for nearly 7-8 years (with more with a loose connection). But while I don’t dislike her, I just don’t feel any real connection either.

I feel about the same level of closeness to her as I did with my aunt (who also passed from cancer in 2020), while my sisters see Lisa as a second mother.

Especially the older of my sister (again for the purposes of this post) Kira who has taken a lot after her in both her attitude and hobbies. 

Whenever I visit Kira or my grandpa (who both live near Lisa, about 6 hours from me), Kira constantly makes passive-aggressive remarks about how I should put more effort into my relationship with Lisa.

I am fully aware of the fact that most people probably will agree with Kira, but I really struggle with Lisa. We never were on the same wavelength and it's just awkward. We did make a lot of inappropriate jokes growing up since we both agreed that was hilarious, but beyond that I have no connection to her. And current day quick coffees or even birthdays are just super awkward long silences, with mild catching up and lots of gossip about people I don't know. 

The latter being my girlfriends first remark, after we left the first function she got to be a part of (I had thought it long before for the record, she just said it out loud). 

&nbsp; 

I don't know how to approach this situation. I don't talk about my feelings. And my entire mother and sisters adore her. I just don't. 

&nbsp; 

I’m also fairly sure the feeling is mutual. Our interactions always feel forced and awkward, and I think she’d probably prefer just having a relationship with my sisters, but she includes because she'd feel bad excluding me and because it would look bad (she cares a lot about image, hence all the gossip).

&nbsp; 

Also might be worth noting that I, in general, struggle to maintain relationships with people even the ones I do really care about. I don't feel much of an urge to interact often, so it has to be a conscious decision. 

&nbsp; 
 
So yeah, that’s where I’m at. I don’t hate her, but I don’t feel close to her, and forcing it just feels wrong and would make me feel worse. I honestly don’t know what to do, but it is what it is ig. ",1,1759415841.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

* Great coffee is a bonus! 
* Does not have to be fancy at all, but looking for whatever it is to be really good! I.e., I'd happily sit on a plastic bench and eat food from a food truck if it's amazing, rather than being in a fancy environment with mediocre food. If there is fancy AND good, even better!
