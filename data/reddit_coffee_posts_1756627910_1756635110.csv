1n4r0g7,https://i.redd.it/u075qr1txbmf1.png,Radio Tracen News Broadcast 31.8.,"Welcome to Radio Tracen. I'm Mr. Tracen and I hope you're having a Marvelous Sunday.

It's time for the news.

A funeral is being prepared for the recently deceased CARROTMAN. Preparations are currently underway with many showing there support and asking how to help.

In other News.

The Fences at the Mejiro Estate have come under attack as sources say they saw an Uma destroying the fences around the building. Tamino Gimlet later admitting to be the culprit. When asked Why, she gave numerous poetic yet inconclusive answered. And you thought your dorm mate was a pain...

Got some cheerful news now.

King Halo held a charity Event where she and Haru Urara distributed Carrots and Medical Equipment to the Uma's and Trainers of Tracen. The Carrots where collected from an external Farmer in Kochi that Haru Urara was helping and King Halo assured that none of the contaminated water was used during the growing process.

Some update on our explorers.

Sweep Tosho continued her research on the counterfeit carat machine. After allegedly gaining the support of one of the school's political parties, she determined that the Caratium used to create the carats was lighter than usual. She promised to uncover the rest of the operation and demanded the director (whom she calls ""Northern Taste"") reveal the truth. The director, when asked, simply brushed the threats off as the ramblings of a Madwoman and ushered everyone to stay calm.

Now for the sports segment:

The highly anticipated eating contest between Oguri Cap and Special Week has been, for now, cancelled. In her announcement, Oguri Cap explained that she was feeling unwell after consuming a giant crad she found at the beach and forgave Special Week for her eating of the Honey pudding.

This news was sponsored by CoffeeRush. CoffeRush: Feel the Rush of a warm cup of Coffee in your hands.

Got a Song for you now and it reminds me of a certain special Uma here on campus.

The truth is, I was scared to be alone, which led to some bad friendships and romantic relationships. I decided to stay celibate after my last relationship ended, a year and half ago, and since then, I’ve slowly learned to be happy alone. Now I need to have time for myself everyday, but this summer, it’s been pretty rare.

So, right now I have the house for myself for three days and I’m thrilled. This morning I woke up in an excellent mood (had a great dream too), put some happy music on and made myself a brunch. Bread, guacamole, fried egg, bacon, a peach and coffee. It was perfect. I’m so happy, it feels like I’m on a date with myself.",1,1756634938.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

1n4qxq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alien/comments/1n4qxq6/ill_tell_you_whats_wrong_with_alien_earthtm/,I’ll tell you what’s wrong with Alien Earth(tm),"Strap in and get some tea/coffee, for you, my good sir, for you are about to get some grade-A reading material rant thing.I liked the first episode. I even didn’t mind the super-early reveal of the alien since, well, we’ve already seen the alien so thought maybe they were trying something new and didn’t want to go the “don’t show the alien for the first 50% of the series” route. Whatever. And the first episode did feel really high budget. Things started falling apart slowly, and by the end of the 4th episode I knew exactly what was wrong: Just like with NuTrek(tm), the creators just don’t care all that much about the original franchise and wanna do their own thing, leaving the original “thing” as a mere backdrop. I am 99% certain that the studio had a screenplay about “crime-fighting robot kids on an island” when suddenly they had the Alien(tm) franchise dropped on them and they had to quickly find something - it comes off as awkward, like two tv series frankensteined into one. It’s sad too, cause the visuals are super-duper awesome and something I would have never dreamed of in my childhood, but just like with the award-winning movie Bedazzled(tm) starring Brendan Fraser as the gullible dupe and Elisabeth Hurley as the devil, every time Brendan Fraser wished for something there was always a “catch”, this is how it is with NuTrek and now this alien franchise.  At the end of the 4th episode, what finally pushed me over the edge was the scene>! where one of the ‘kids’ asks “mr so-and-so, what are the big Five?”, with a long infodump lecture following. !<That’s just now how it’s done, it’s literally one of the first things that they teach - show, don’t tell. It could have been way more natural if in the big city, for example, one of the main characters was passing some homeless drunk guy who would’ve said something to one of his pals like “These five corporations  running the earth now, that’s not how it used to be…” before shaking is head and taking a sip - something like that would've been 100 times better.I think the reason this all happened was cause shows like Silo, Handmaid’s tale (at the beginning, at least), and The Last Of Us, already had a wealth of good writing to fall back on, whereas with alien the movies were basically “a haunted house, but in space”So, you might ask, If I’m so smart, what would I propose? I don’t even have to invent anything: there are already official Alien franchise books that could be adapted into a tv series. I personally think a series set on a world like at the beginning of Romulus would be great, where the aliens are at first a distant rumor, but as reports increase, things slowly start getting tense, with people thinking what to do/evacuate, to the point where it slowly would descend into a “Last of us but in space” type of situation. You’d say “but… that’s expensive!” To which I’d answer: this series was also expensive, plus ‘space’ equals metal corridor set-pieces in spaceships so it wouldn’t even be THAT expensive, maybe even cheaper actually to make. >!Oh and I did like the “cat” alien baby at the end of episode 4, that was actually pretty good.!<",1,1756634748.0,alien,1,0.67,False

1n4qsry,https://www.reddit.com/r/AffiliateMarket_Hub/comments/1n4qsry/2_best_ways_to_start_affiliate_marketing_in_2025/,2 Best Ways to Start Affiliate Marketing in 2025.,"For context, I have made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling digital products.

But I recently started promoting a few, higher-profit margin physical products - and the conversions are much better.

This is due to, in my opinion, primarily to the fact that the quality of affiliate programs and innovative physical products has really become much better.

And that fact that people actually WANT these products. There is no ""make money"" benefit, and that really does help with conversions.

So the question is - what is the best way to start selling physical products.

Obviously, you want an edge.

So here are two methods you might want to test.

Option One: Create a short digital report. This should focus on solving an actual problem that people are willing to spend money on. This could be anything. You'll be amazed at the amount and calibre of products you will find.

You can create this and sell it on your own cart, like [Zylvie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ1RH9K1jSM) or Gumroad or Buy Me A Coffee.

Option Two: Build a hyper-niche directory site on a very specific topic. A lot of people think of these directory sites as a ""local"" directory. While you can build that, I've found building one around products is really good. Google understands what the site is about, and it keeps it highly focused on a topic—unlike a general blog.

The platforms available to do this are different than a couple years ago - much easier to use if you (like me) are fed up with the bugginess of WordPress.

Best advice: pick something you actually have interest in - vs just what you think will make money.

It makes the build so much more enjoyable.

I have a guide on how to set up a directory site I created while I was doing my own research. You can [grab it for free here](https://www.digitalabc.net/affiliate?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=affiliatemarkethub).

I have been financing myself since last 4-5 years. I take very little to no money from home (My family has an unstable financial situation). My income source is through tuitions. What I earn in a month goes by in a blink, food, rent, bills and especially on transportation. I dropped out of uni as it was becoming a burden on my family. I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangouts, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I’m very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through the last two months (June, July). 

To be financially independent and to pay for my own tuition fees, I want to start a business asap, a tea/coffee/juice stall at an area with high foot traffic in Dhaka. 

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of 800 USDT/USDC, which I can repay in 3 months time with interest (rates can be set by lender). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life. 

I will be deleting this post soon, it's actually very embarrassing for me to be asking like this but I currently have no one who can help me with this matter.

**Maturation**: Oloroso sherry butt

**Other**: ABV 52.1%.

**Nose:** Dark chocolate cake drizzled with treacle and prune syrup spiced with a touch of cinnamon and clove oil, but also some butterscotch and caramel notes, coffee and tobacco.

**Palate:** Rich sour plum sauce and espresso softens the mocha and sun-dried raisins with a steeped barley background. To this official tasting note I have to add cherries, herbal notes and I must say that it is pretty sweet

**Finish:** Great balance and length, very much on coffee, dark chocolate and plum.

**Reality**: Yes, Lister has a party rep (and you'll see why fast), but it's also the easiest way to make instant friends. It's not just chaos - you'll find study groups, intramurals, and surprisingly wholesome floor traditions.

**2.**

**Myth**: 'Cameron Library is open 24/7 all year.'

**Reality**: Not exactly. Only during finals season some areas run 24/7 (e.g., lower-level study spaces via ONEcard). Otherwise it closes at night.

**28.**

**Myth**: 'Midterms are spread out.'

**Reality**: Nah, you'll probably get 3 in 2 days. Prepare for academic hell weeks.

**29.**

**Myth**: 'The campus squirrels are cute.'

**Reality**: They are cute... until they steal your food or stare into your soul while you eat.

**30.**

**Myth**: 'There's nothing to do in Edmonton.'

My baby is 5 months old and I've been trying to take her to visit family or friends or even meet a friend for a coffee at a café. Because if we stay home for too long, she gets bored as well - only going for daily walks and shopping won't cut it. So out we go, or we try to.

Almost always, it's a catastrophe. 

Car ride? Fine for 10 minutes max, after that, full on crying. Falling asleep in the car seat is not a thing. Being out after her last nap? Full on drama. The stroller? Fine for fifteen minutes sometimes. Any more than that, no can do. The carrier? Alright for naps but no more than that.

Like how is this supposed to work?? Even if I manage to get to my destination, it's usually exhausting because I need to make sure baby is entertained enough and she won't accept anyone else to hold her either.

Sometimes, just sometimes it would be nice to get a break and to enjoy going out for a little bit. I'm hoping it will get better as she gets older but right now this is hard.

1n4qdrs,https://i.redd.it/zz6sf35bqbmf1.png,The Skin of the Kangaroo,"**A History of the Future**

There are great men, this is something I do believe. There are a few men that have shifted the narrative of history in one direction or another by force of their personal will. Of course, much like the reconciliation between determinism and free will, it is not that it was necessarily a will of their own creation, but an exceptional individual in a specific material context. That said, more often than not, the great movements of history are more often precipitated by a change of circumstance that cannot be assigned to the will of any one individual. Plagues and eruptions and floods, among other things.

For a while now, Australia has been subjected to a distended La Niña weather complex over the South Pacific, when the ocean is cooler and the weather here at least wetter. This was uninterrupted from 2020 to 2023, followed by a brief interval of El Niño between June 2023 and April of 2024, and I believe at present we have returned to La Niña. The conjecture that spurs the series of events that results in the below map here, is what if some unknown feature of the South Pacific weather complex breaks as a result of climate change, and we are subject to a permanent altered state of temperatures whereby Australia cools and receives more rainfall?

Well, in reality this would probably take greater than 200 years to result in any kind of shift, but for the purposes of having something to talk about we will assume that it is both more rapid on account of runaway climate change and also that it is coopted by human forces. So rain increases across the eastern seaboard; it peaks above 1,500 ml per annum across the entire eastern side of the continent by the mid-2030s. Eventually, both by natural forces of water overflooding natural reservoirs and canals built to divert its flow, this water is brought into the Eyre Basin complex. Rivers that were once intermittent become perennial, and Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre becomes a permanent inland sea, a small sea, but a sea, nonetheless. Later, this is extended southwards to stabilise the shoreline by filtering into Ngarndamukia-Lake Torrens and then into the Spencer Gulf. This results in both lakes becoming freshwater seas, which is not actually that catastrophic in terms of flora and fauna as the native fish therein are by and large freshwater species that flood in after excessive rain in the region, but I digress.

This is simply excellent for the Australia state generally, because it means an extension of farmland and an outlet for a swollen property market. Go to the interior, they would say, there are greener pastures there. The primary beneficiaries ought to be the Indigenous communities there, such as the Diyari, because vast tracts of land that were frankly inhospitable are now fertile and valuable (with the assistance of matured land rehabilitation practices that come out of the mining industry, incidentally). In practice, they run up against the impositions of developers, the federal government, farming cooperatives, mining interests, and the most annoying liberals in the world. The boon of this new land is absorbed by Australia’s standard interest groups.

Over time, there are hundreds if not thousands of attempts to broker mineral and land rights, attempts to include Indigenous enterprise in agriculture, and targeted job programs. Almost all of these falter because they are piecemeal and don’t result in the uplift of whole communities but rather atomise them according to economic interest. Those Indigenous that collaborate are considered sellouts and coconuts. These attempts are particularly faulty because the interior population explodes around the two seas, which I believe is justifiable on the dual basis that the Indigenous already have a high birthrate and a notion I’ve borrowed from Matheun whereby frontiers tend to spike birthrates when people can conceive of opportunity.

In any event, there are too many High Court rulings, too much wealth extracted, over the course of decades. Some plucky Indigenous thinker pens manifesto advocating for the arming of the Black Sovereignty Movement, and when these are forthcoming, these groups start conducting sit ins or rather occupation of their traditional lands. This concept spreads like wildfire among the different Indigenous communities in the country. These result in tense standoffs with by-and-large South Australian police, as well as well armed corporations, but they generally go the way of the Indigenous because nothing of note has yet happened. Some see this as natural recompense for centuries of neglect and abuse, some see it as treason and intolerable.

But a true conflict emerges when the Barngarla attempt to forcibly evict corporations from their pre-existing infrastructure, namely the vast IOCG mining operations around the blooming Lake Torrens. South Australia’s IOCG deposits are among the largest in the world, and by the eve of this conflict (let’s say the 2080s) is being exploited apace. The Barngarla, heavily armed, occupy worksites and refuse to move after the military and police are eventually called in. Under pressure from mining interests completely out of patience with broiling Indigenous hostility to their operations after two decades of armed opposition, the federal government orders the military to violently evict the Barngarla. The first shots are fired, as it were, and let us say that 13 police officers and 40 Barngarla are killed. Ultimately, the latter withdraw.

There is outrage, either that the military would act so rashly or that Indigenous sovereignty had gotten to this stage, all of it directed at the federal government. What results is increasing terrorism conducted against mining and agricultural operations across the country, which is met with reprisals in the form of mass arrests and raids, and a state of general conflict ensues.

There are innumerable factors that exacerbate this into a general collapse of civil authority that takes over twenty years to boil over. For instance, the US declines precipitously both internationally and as a sorry consequence of actions we can date to today. NIAID’s gutting and an anti-vaxxing sentiment that far outstrips the rest of the world means when the US suffers infectious disease outbreaks, the incident rate of which has increased apace due to third order effects of climate change, they are hit comparatively hard. By 2100 there have been seven global epidemics and in each the US has been unprepared and seen huge swathes of their population die from preventable illness. Climate change itself also ruins many of the US’ economic powerhouses: LA is half its size in a century’s time, because no one wants to live in the middle of a perpetual bushfire. What this means is that the global economy becomes much more capricious, because the US dollar as a reserve store of value becomes suspect. There is a proliferation of alternative currencies and baskets of goods none of which are as meaningful as the USD, and in classic Australian fashion the RBA clings to the USD as a store of value much longer than it ought to.

There are variable cultural replies to the unfolding conflict between the Indigenous and the federal government, ranging from nervous support from Melbourne yuppies to Queensland’s very own homebrew KKK, and the social fabric of the Australian identity is torn along the seams. In government, this has a range of effects: Labor is incapable of managing an increasingly hardline militant unionist wing that is at odds with itself as to the Indigenous Question. Meanwhile, the Coalition breaks into three because cosmopolitan Liberals, parochial Nationals, and a really quite frightening Liberal National Party in QLD cannot form a comprehensive position on anything that doesn’t disagree with the other two parties. West Australian and Tasmanian localist MPs get a plurality of votes in their respective seats over the course of several electoral cycles, and Indigenous members nationally are either put to task to prove their loyalty or barred altogether from taking office on increasingly spurious procedural grounds, such as an unwillingness to swear allegiance to the king.

By the 2120s, state governments refuse to implement federal legislation for a wide variety of reasons. They disagree with security measures, so their state police forces refuse to cooperate with the AFP; GST redistribution is considered unfair and so states set up their own tax offices to collect what would otherwise go to Canberra; attempts to reform housing policy are uniformly opposed; some states believe that environmental restrictions are too permissive (particularly Southern Queensland); and some states believe that environmental restrictions are too strict (particularly Northern Queensland); or they want a harsher reply to Indigenous terrorism. By 2130 a very dim Prime Minister declares a general state of emergency, and attempts to arrest whole state governments, even those of their own party (no telling), and this leads to resistance on a state level.

This does wonders for the Black Sovereignty Movement, who in the case of the Barngarla and Kokatha in the south and a coalition of Indigenous groups spearheaded by the Diyari around Lake Eyre secure general occupations in the areas they claim and then some. However, due to the nature of the two occupations, with the former a sort of liberal democratic movement and the latter a paramilitary force, they are unable to integrate their two groups and so remain distinct entities, which results in the two Indigenous states in the centre of the map.

Otherwise, chaos ensues, with Australia entering a period of severe civil war that kills two million people directly and leads to a further eight million or so fleeing internationally. This is of course exacerbated by foreign entities, including China, Japan (who’ve managed to get over their fear of immigrants so long as they speak Japanese right, including many millions of American expatriates), a French-led EU, and in the specific case of the Indigenous parties the African Union, who lease them everything from assault rifles to helicopters once Port Augusta is under Barngarla control.

The war takes a quarter of a century to shake out, with the final formal hostilities between North and South Queensland ceasing in 2062. There is a period of licking wounds, and then taking stock, and realising that erstwhile the future has arrived.

**Australia in the Year of the Tricentennial**

Here, to save myself some time, I will rewrite the entries on each entity on the map as I expect that they are difficult to read in pixel art point-five form.

Union of Western Australia  
Population: 7 Million  
Inheriting Australia’s navy and most of its overseas receivables, WA is a highly socialised, cultured, and optimistic place with very little interest in the drama of to their east. They’re looking at Mars.

Federation of Ngarndamukia  
Population: 3.5 Million  
The more ecumenical of the two major Indigenous states. Rich off of the largest IOCG deposits in the world and an attractive destination for expatriates, full of garden cities and excellent coffee.

Republic of Kati Thanda  
Population: 2.2 Million  
Governed by an insular coalition of post insurgent interest, Kati is nonetheless among the safest states in the world and increasingly wealthy. Karnic is the linga franca.

Union of Tasmania  
Population: 1 Million  
Trying their hand at gambling, which has been outlawed across the Mainland, to kickstart a struggling economy. Known for vernacular timber architecture, generic engineering, and, to this day, profound poverty.

Republic of Victory  
Population: 13 Million  
The Labor Party has enjoyed uninterrupted rule over a ‘secularised’ Victoria for some fifty years. Despite its liberal affectations it is deeply repressive and technocratic.

Free Coast of Bega  
Population: 600 Thousand  
A loose confederacy of coastal towns with little love lost for the cold rule of Sydney or Melbourne. They reply by aggressively trawling the South East Coast, which in turn leads to piracy.

Federation of Eora  
Population: 14 Million  
Sydney is still the largest city on the continent, operating almost as a city state. It has a unique dialect of English, Lebanese, and the various Pacific Islander languages that made their refuge there.

Tamworth Freestate  
Population: 240 Thousand  
Basically the personal demesne of the Tamworth Farming Coop and the parochial Thompson Dynasty. The poorest state on the continent.

Commonwealth of Australia – “Queensland”  
Population: 3 Million  
Awkwardly retains elements of Australia’s White Nationalist movement, which has stalled development considerably for lack of FDIs. Very decentralised, with Townsville an almost perfunctory capital.

Republic of New England and Darling Downs  
Population: 7 Million  
A state that balances ecology and agriculture. It could not find a home in the radical chauvinism of the north nor the technocratic urbanism of the south. Brisbane is the cultural epicentre of the continent.

The Dhuwa  
Population: 210 Thousand  
Internationally obscure for its peaceful secession and strict border control. In theory a republic but what little is known of their priorities seems to centre on ‘resurrecting Barnumbirr’, whatever that means. Big computing industry.

Some things of note.

A fine distinction between the private and public sectors has been liquidated globally. The resolution of certain structural economic problems like the crowding out effect, infrastructure spending, and moral hazard have been resolved by increasing the inroads both sectors have into one another. To our eyes, it would be difficult to say whether this is communism or corporatism, as there is in every instance except the most backwards of states (such as Tamworth) a very fluid transition between the two. Most companies have government appointees, and most governments have corporate liaisons that work together to allocate equity, labour, and equipment to whatever is tabulated to benefit both. This is augmented by reliance on public AI systems which most states have at least one of, which tend to be reviewed qualitatively by people because they still sometimes make spurious conclusions and also don’t have as much raw data as they used to, which leads me to my second point.

There is no global internet. The war between freedom of information and censorship was won by censorship. What this ended up looking like is every country setting up their own version of the World Wide Web. While every nation on Earth is signed up to public access treaties the actual implementation of these treaties is spotty, with some states being quite open to foreign interface, as in the case of Dhuwa or WA, and others being very much a circumscribed internet, as in the case of Victory or Queensland. The freest exchange of information tends to be via proprietary internets used between universities, but these are also limited where questions of national security are concerned, which some states going so far as to have entirely separate internets with entirely separate physical servers to maintain said security. A big reason for this is that some degree of augmentation is now possible, and most people have cybernetic enhancements with mildly invasive properties. This can range from Sims style IDs hanging over everyone’s heads to, in egregious cases, propaganda funnelled directly to the temporal lobe. In Australia uptake has been slow as compares to places like China, Nigeria, and much of Europe. The two places it is ubiquitous are Victory, in which it is an at-birth enforcement on the part of the Labor Party, and the Dhuwa, where it is taken up for religious reasons that are still not well understood outside of the country.

Fusion reaction is now a commercial possibility, although the overhead still means that it is primarily found in larger nations, with a country such as Tasmania relying on a wholly renewable energy grid. Almost all public and private transport is electric, with oil relegated to secondary industrial uses and consumer goods, which has taken the oomph out of the environmental collapse, although without waxing lyrical it was still tremendously bad for a while there. These fusion reactors have become sufficiently modular with practice that there are now fun applications for them, the most obvious being spaceplanes. The advent of the spaceplane meant that orbital entry has become available to most nations above a certain size, with WA in particular possessing a fleet numbering 80 in total. That said, they are currently collaborating with Indonesia to build a space elevator, because there is sufficient quantity of industrial product in space that simply dumping it into the ocean for collection is becoming burdensome.

But war persists, conflicts persist, terrorism is still rife in many corners of the Earth. On the Australian continent there are a few live conflicts, which are as follows:

\-            Subterfuge and terrorism by the Kalkadoon in western Queensland.

\-            Sabotage of New English agriculture by Tamworth-funded terrorists.

\-            Low-level separatism in interior Eora.

\-            Piracy along the Southeast Coast implicitly condoned by Bega.

\-            Border scuffles between Ngarndamukia and Victory.

\-            Internal power struggles within Kati Thanda.

But as compares to the war that had engulfed an entire continent within living memory, things are peaceful. Recently, leaders from all 11 Australian successor states staged a -carefully choreographed- event in New Canberra to commemorate the Tercentenary of the Federation of Australia, which is sufficiently posterior to current affairs that it has taken on the nostalgia of a founding myth. There was certainly no talk of reconciliation, of a second Australia, particularly as both Queensland and Victory claim the title while much of the world recognises Perth as the legitimate successor of the Lucky Country. But there was a sense of optimism, that they are not finished, that the green and gold continent has more to give.

- Researchers analyzed NHANES data from 2011‑2018, covering 8,333 adults with DXA scans and dietary recalls.
- Participants with the highest coffee intake showed about a 13% greater appendicular skeletal muscle‑to‑BMI ratio compared with non‑coffee drinkers; regular coffee gave a 12% boost and total caffeine an 11% boost. Decaffeinated coffee showed no significant link.
- The association was roughly linear but disappeared in individuals classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²).
- The study is cross‑sectional, so it cannot establish cause and effect, and relies on self‑reported coffee consumption.
- Muscle mass was measured, not strength or functional performance, so the findings do not directly translate to physical capability.
- Practical takeaway: coffee may provide a small muscle‑related benefit for non‑obese adults, but resistance training, adequate protein, sleep, and healthy weight remain essential.

Why it matters: Coffee could be a modest addition to a muscle‑supporting routine, but it does not replace proven strategies.

المهم كيف بعملها بدون اي جهاز او ماكنة او أداة.. طبعا زي ما بحكو الحاجة ام الاختراع فانا بيوم ما كان عندي ماكنة وتعطلت والكافيه جنبنا سكر.. وانا الصبح بدي اميركان من البيت. فكان الحل اني اجرب اشي خطر براسي وكان كالتالي:   

من المحمص احكيله بدي قهوة طحنة أميركية ناعمة (جبتها من محمص اردني وقهوة عادية )).   

بالبيت بتحط نصف كمية القهوة التركية بالدلة و بتكمل عادي كأنها تركية يعني حطها ع النار حركها لما تغلي وهون استنى..    

بما تغلي لا تصبها مباشرة بالمج او الكاسة زي التركية لا، شفت المصفاية الصغيرة اللي قلتلك خليها معك فوق؟ ايوا هاتها حطها ع الكاسة او المج فوق وبعدين صب القهوة هسا.   

لما تصب بتصير القهوة صافية، ارجع ديرها بالدلة وخليها تغلي شوي زيادة تغلي تغلي ع نار هادية.. بعدين ارجع صبها كمان مرة ولا تنسى المصفاة.    

صحتين وهنا جرب ازكى قهوة امريكية بدون اي أداة أميركية.  


ينصح بالتجربة من باب صقل المهارة والخبرة.. لكن أكيد الأمريكية الأصلية الذ بس لا يعني انها هاي سيئة!!  أبدا انا صرت كل فترة وفتؤة اعملها.     



نوت مهمة: القهوة نفسها مهما خزنتها ما بروح طعمها عكس التركية بعد فترة بخف طعمها.   

نوت ٢ : بتنشرب باردة وسخنة عادي.   

نوت٣: حتى لما تشربها لو تركتها لتاني يوم عادي بتنشرب وبتضل ع طعمتها.

1n4qbbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1n4qbbb/should_you_switch_to_planet_true_laundry/,Should You Switch to Planet True Laundry Detergent Sheets Today,"**Testing Planet True PT30-FS Detergent Sheets: An Honest Experience**  

I didn’t think I’d ever switch from my liquid detergent, but curiosity got the best of me when I came across the Planet True PT30-FS detergent sheets. They had glowing reviews about their eco-friendliness and compact form, so I decided to test them out. From the very first load, these small, unassuming sheets seemed intent on challenging all my preconceived notions about laundry detergents.  

**Effortlessly Compact and Travel-Friendly**  
The compactness of this detergent is undoubtedly one of its standout features. The slim packaging doesn’t just save space; it’s a game changer for someone like me, who often shuttles between work trips and weekend getaways. Tossing a few sheets into my travel bag felt far easier than lugging around detergent bottles prone to leaks. This feature really shone during a weekend camping trip—no more mid-laundry spills or clunky powder boxes.  

**Check Planet True PT30-FS price on Amazon.**  

**Impressive Cleaning Performance and Versatility**  
If there’s one thing I value, it’s efficiency, and these detergent sheets came through. Whether it was a chilly wash for darks or a hot cycle for heavy-duty whites, the sheets dissolved completely without leaving behind any residue. On particularly stubborn stains—relics of coffee spills and greasy kitchen experiments—it felt like the natural cleaning enzymes were doing some seriously heavy lifting. Admittedly, for deeply set stains, I still had to pre-treat for the best results, but regular daily washes became a breeze.  

**Eco-Friendly Ingredients: A Win for Nature and My Skin**  
Having sensitive skin makes me wary of harsh detergents, but these sheets didn’t disappoint. They lived up to their claims of being hypoallergenic and free from phosphates, parabens, and sulfates. Even on delicate fabrics and activewear, the cleaning felt both thorough and gentle. The subtle fresh linen fragrance was far from overpowering—just the right level of “clean” that doesn’t clash with colognes or irritate skin. Knowing that the packaging is recyclable and biodegradable adds to the feel-good factor.  

**Easy-to-Use and Mess-Free Convenience**  
Let’s talk about how simple it was to get started. You just grab one of these pre-measured sheets and toss it in with your load—no measuring, spilling, or second-guessing. For someone who abhors the sticky mess of liquid detergents, this was worth its weight in gold. And since the sheets dissolve as soon as they hit water, I never had to deal with clumps or detergent residue that ruins your favorite fabrics. Convenience, efficiency, and cleanliness packaged as a thin sheet—what’s not to love?  

**Boons**  
- Compact design takes up minimal space at home and during travel.  
- Gentle on skin without synthetic perfumes or overbearing chemicals.  
- Dissolves seamlessly in all washing conditions—cold, warm, or hot water.  
- Durable cleaning performance suitable for delicates and everyday use.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Struggles with heavy-duty, set-in stains unless pre-treatment is used.  
- While ideal for most fabric types, the light fragrance might feel too mild for those who prefer stronger scents.  

**Market Rivals**  
Naturally, I had to compare these sheets to other alternatives like Tru Earth and Dropps. While all offer eco-conscious solutions, the Planet True PT30-FS detergent sheets stood out for their fast-dissolving properties, especially in cold water. Tru Earth, on the other hand, left a slight undissolved residue on some occasions. Dropps is great, but handling the pods without accidentally bursting them is nerve-racking. On the downside, Planet True does lag slightly in tackling extremely tough stains where more abrasive options excel. Still, if sustainability, simplicity, and sensitive-skin friendliness are priorities, these sheets are hard to beat.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Pricing is always key, especially when transitioning to environmentally friendly products that often cost more than conventional alternatives. With Planet True PT30-FS, it’s not just about the price tag but what you get in return. One box is equivalent to multiple loads, and its pre-measured format maximizes efficiency while eliminating waste. Compared to traditional detergents where you tend to overpour or undermeasure, these sheets save more in the long run by preventing unnecessary usage. Are they worth it? For the convenience and eco-benefits, I think they deliver solid value.

I (34F) have made many colleagues turned friends at work and we've kept in contact since 10 years ago till date. I was much closer to 2 of them, X (Female) and P (Male) as we try to have meet ups every few months or at least texted to stay updated. One of the meet ups was with P and we generally would chat and share about everything. (note that X and P do not know each other)

P and me decided to go for lunch and coffee after so we could spend more time before calling it a day. During the meet up, P started sharing about his recent outing with his male clique (I know these people but am not close to them). P shared that M (one of the guys in the male clique) has just gotten to know a girl and was dating her. Personally, M wasn't someone of good vibes and somewhat obnoxious about how he was a good catch with ladies hence I didn't quite like him, but I listened to P sharing nonetheless. 

P shared that M had boasted during the outing about how he ""got"" the girl and her first time, **xual experience etc etc. M mentioned to the guys that he really loved the girl and looked forward to marrying her eventually. As a female listening to what P was sharing, I felt very disgusted with M for viewing the girl as a pleasure partner and **xual object although marriage was mentioned!

I soon realised that M might be actually dating my close female friend, X, and started probing a little more from P to confirm my suspicions. After more questioning and referencing, it was confirmed that M was indeed dating X! I asked P if this really being shared and discussed between the guys and P confirmed it. I asked again if P feels this was appropriate and if he would go into such details about a potential partner. P agreed that he would never do that but would not stop M from doing so.

P sensing that I might be upset, tried to brush it off and said, ""don't take it personally, M is usually boasting and trying to show off his ""better"" side"". P then said to not share with X since this was just our casual chit chat. I agreed to close the chapter and not continue the conversation. Later we ended the day and parted ways.

The same evening, I kept thinking about the whole conversation and could not help feeling really upset about X meeting and dating an AH who was making use of her body. I decided to text X and ask if she was dating M.

Me: Hey X, how's things going for you?
X: Really well etc etc
(Casual back and forth texts)
Me: I saw on social media that you are with M??
X: Oh yeah, we are getting to know each other. Just dating for now
Me: Oh alright (Proceeds to share my conversation with P previously)
X: Oh, did M really say that? He didn't mention anything to me
Me: Yeah, I didn't like what I was hearing and I thought I had to share with you about M
(Few more texts back and forth before we stopped texting)

2 days later, P frantically texted and wanted me to call back immediately which I did. P said that M was blasting him in their group chat and asked what I did. I apologised to P and let him know that I had eventually told X about M's ""sharing session"". P went panic mode and said M would not let him go, along the lines of if M does not have further outcome with X, M would take actions towards P. P begged for me to talk to X.

I decided to text X and find out if something had happened between her and M. X called back and let me know that she was behaving a little funny around M and made M suspicious so he took her phone and looked through her chats. As M also didn't really like me much, he noticed that X and me were texting so he decided to go into our chats hence saw our texts. With X, M called me names and how I was ruining his relationship and chances of getting wife material, X. M also questioned X if she thought he was such a person. X told me she didn't think it was going to be that bad and would still like to be in contact with M, which I said it was fine and I wasn't going to dictate her choices of males.

X thanked me for letting her know and was glad that I was looking out for her. I told her I would still support her even if they really do get more serious and potentially married.

Fast forward to a few days later, P texted me and asked how the issue was going. I responded that I had spoken to X and it was well.

That was the last time I spoke with X. Maybe she had chosen M and M requested for her to stop contacting me?

1n4q70x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1n4q70x/explore_if_finish_classic_dishwasher_detergent/,Explore If Finish Classic Dishwasher Detergent Lives Up to the Hype,"The **Finish Classic Powerball Dishwasher Detergent (60ct)** has become a consistent part of my daily routine, and considering its global reputation as a top dishwasher detergent, I was genuinely curious to see how it would perform. As someone who relies heavily on dishwashers to keep up with the endless flow of dishes—cue the hectic family meals—I gave this detergent a thorough trial. From its cleaning power to its ease of use, let’s break down my experience with it.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
I’ll start with what stood out immediately—the design of the detergent tablets. These little capsules are perfectly pre-measured, and it’s a relief not to mess with any wrappers or powder measurements. I’m used to fumbling with clunky detergent boxes and worrying about adding too much or too little. Not with these! Just pop one directly into the dishwasher's detergent compartment, and you’re good to go. The simplicity was a time-saver, especially during jam-packed evenings when loading the dishwasher feels like a race against the clock. Speaking of ease, no pre-soaking or pre-rinsing is necessary, which is a total win for someone constantly battling baked-on lasagna pans.

**Cleaning Effectiveness: A Power Move**  
Of course, the main question is: does it work? The answer is a resounding yes! During the testing period, it handled everything from greasy skillets to cups stained with endless rounds of tea and coffee. The advanced powder mix with bleach tackled stains effortlessly, even on those mugs that are notorious for hanging onto discoloration. The Powerball tech wasn’t just marketing fluff; it genuinely powered through dried-on food that I assumed would need a second wash. Plates came out sparkling, and glassware stayed impressively streak-free—an essential for anyone who prioritizes sparkling glasses at dinner parties.

[Check Finish Classic Powerball Dishwasher Detergent price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b09mztfsbp/)

**Positives**  
This product has a lot going for it, and a few highlights stood out during my trial:  
- The no-pre-rinse requirement saves water and time without compromising cleanliness.  
- Pre-measured capsules eliminate guesswork and ensure consistent results every time.  
- Remarkable stain removal, especially on stubborn tea and coffee marks.  
- Prevents redeposit on my glassware, keeping glasses streak-free and crystal clear.  

**Performance Limitations**  
It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, as there are a few areas that could improve:  
- Extremely heavy grease sometimes required extra cleaning, not ideal for pots with layers of grime.  
- A strong bleachy scent lingers during the wash cycle, which may be off-putting for certain users.  
- While effective, the detergent isn’t as eco-friendly as enzyme-based options I’ve tried before.  
- Not suitable for delicate items like certain plastics or hand-painted dishware—proceed with caution.

**Good Aspects**  
When it comes to its primary advantages, this dishwasher detergent boasts impressive strengths across critical areas. I loved how easily it tackles dried and greasy food without the need for a pre-rinse. Its advanced formula with built-in glass protection ensured that all my drinkware came out looking as if it had just been polished. And let’s not overlook how convenient it was; having a capsule format meant no spills, no fuss, and a lot less frustration!

**Market Rivals**  
In the world of dishwasher detergents, there’s no shortage of competition. Compared to products like Cascade Platinum and Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent Packs, there are some clear standouts and gaps for the Finish Classic Powerball. Cascade Platinum can sometimes edge it out when tackling ultra-greasy pans, as I’ve noticed. However, the Finish detergent leaves fewer water spots on glasses, a strong advantage, especially for anyone frustrated with subpar results on glassware. When stacked against eco-friendlier picks like Seventh Generation, the Finish tablets trade green credentials for sheer cleaning power. Both rivals offer strong cases depending on your priorities, but if maximum clean is what you’re after, this one has an edge.

**Price Performance**  
The price-to-quality ratio is quite reasonable given the performance level. Considering its superior cleaning power and easy-to-use design, it’s worth spending a bit more for the peace of mind that your plates and cutlery will consistently come out spotless. Sure, there are budget options out there, but they often involve trading off performance or using double the amount to get the same results. This detergent feels like smart spending where it truly counts—in effectiveness and reliability.

1n4q70e,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1n4q70e/new_therapist/,New therapist,"Hey guys! My new therapist after our intake call said she was going to document some of my diagnoses but not all of them. She said she’s not convinced I’m Bipolar II - for now. 

I’ve only had one session with her (my intake) but I’m worried she won’t take it seriously. When I’m off of Vraylar I am depressed like all the time. I’ve only ever had one hypomanic episode that I can really recall in my life, after I had a strong coffee for the first time. 

She mentioned that my depression could be due to trauma, but when I’ve been off of Vraylar even when on a pretty strong dose of Wellbutrin and abilify I’ve still gotten depressed, so I’m pretty convinced I have it. 

On a side note my mom doesn’t think I have Bipolar II either, she thinks I’m autistic because she thinks she’s autistic. 

I don’t know, I get like “imposter syndrome” especially when I’ve been feeling good for awhile (like I have now, Vraylar is amaaaaazing) so I’m just kind of questioning whether I should explore not being bipolar II or if I should discuss with my new therapist that her saying she’s leaving it off of my records for now makes me uncomfortable. I want to be believed I guess. I’ve been diagnosed for like 6? years. If I wasn’t bipolar II I feel like this is something my previous therapist of 2.5 years would have potentially mentioned or brought up. 

Fortunately I still have a psychiatrist and they seem pretty solid on my diagnosis, so I’m not worried I’m going to be taken off my meds anytime soon.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a T20 showdown where Saint Lucia Kings (SLK) and Antigua & Barbuda Falcons (ABF) collide like two overfilled coffee mugs at a café—spilling potential, steam, and a hint of chaos. Let’s parse the odds, dissect the news, and serve up a prediction with a side of humor.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The bookmakers have priced this like a high-stakes poker game: **SLK at -400** (implied probability: **80%**) and **ABF at +200** (**20%**). That’s not just a gap—it’s a canyon. SLK’s dominance in the CPL isn’t just a blip; Colin Munro’s 2,500-run legacy for Trinbago Knight Riders might as well be a spiritual omen for SLK’s batting lineup. Meanwhile, ABF’s odds are about as optimistic as a vegan at a barbecue.

But let’s not let the numbers blind us. SLK have won **two straight matches** by margins that make a “laughing gas” commercial look tame. ABF, on the other hand, are 3-3, with a résumé that includes one of their games against SLK being washed out—because even the weather respects the drama of this rivalry.

### Digest the News: Stars, Stats, and Slightly Less Glorious Stories

**Saint Lucia Kings**: Led by the caffeinated chaos of David Wiese, SLK’s batting order is a buffet of firepower. Johnson Charles (2,231 CPL runs for SLK, ever heard of him?) and Tim David are the kind of hitters who make bowlers question their life choices. Oh, and Tim Seifert’s wicketkeeping? He’s the human equivalent of a spreadsheet—organized, unemotional, and slightly judgmental.

**Antigua & Barbuda Falcons**: They’ve got **Obed McCoy**, a death-over bowler with a strike rate (**12.75**) that makes a caffeinated hummingbird look laz

I have an off-grid deck (1200 sq ft - yes it's that big) with a full kitchen that I want to power. My current needs are:
- refrigerator - that needs to run during the day that will turn off once the sun goes down
- small hot water heater
- lights (15 lights)
- ice maker (small table top ice maker)
- blender
- toaster
- coffee maker
- 4 fans

Nice to have but could use propane if it's too expensive
- oven with stovetop
- heaters

What do I need in terms of battery storage to be able to run this kitchen for 6 hours (3 hours of heavy use while preparing food)

How many panels will I need to charge the batteries throughout the day?

Is it less expensive to buy the parts separately or buy a kit?

As I mentioned, the refrigerator would only need to run during the day 

The ice maker, blender, toaster and coffee maker need to be powered at night. Obviously these devices aren't running full time but I need enough power when using them for short bursts

As I understand it lights are relatively low draw and I can use LEDs to conserve

Hey I haven't posed here before.  I am 40 with pretty much gone CMC joints in my thumbs.  I was diagnosed in 2020 and they were really bad then.  Last imaging or treatment 2022.

Now that my kid is a little bigger, I ran out of cortisone punches on my punch card (joke) years ago (they said any more will do more harm than good), and I am moving somewhere (Washington) with better medical care (rural alaska not so much), AND the surgery outcomes are better it is time for the surgery.

I would like to beable to get into a specialist ASAP, but I know there is a whole diagnostic and referral order.  Can I start some of that process in Alaska and skip doing a bunch of stuff a second time in Washington?  I know I need imaging again, I haven't had any since 2022 when I got my last round of injections while pregnant.  

So thats the main part.  Second question is related, but to concerns about rhumetoid and my new bad wrist pain.  Both, oa amd ra, run in my family, and initially they thought my thumbs were possibly the first signs of rhumetoid because it is bilateral and some other stuff. but lab tests were negative and, until now, I haven't shown other signs.  I am not sure if they tested for anything more than RA factor, again very small town with no specialists.  I had to travel by air just for the shots to a bigger town, so figured hey they say it is just oa and I like that diagnosis better anyway.

My thumb joints are now swelling on amd off and the skin hurts.  One wrist is excruciating, worse than my thumbs ever felt unless I did something I really shouldn't with them, the skin hurts to the touch, no numbness or other nerve issue signs.  But it isn't bilateral.  I still think even my local doc will advise the rhumetoid testing again, but if not should I evem bother requesting it or should I just wait till I am in a better area?  I assume they'll want to run all the tests again anyway.  I don't think I have time before the move to work out any real treatment anyway.  3 weeks till we move, and doing it as a month long road trip.  Hard in fall in Alaska with fucked hands so idk maybe doc could do something shortterm.

Oh last question; brace reccomendations for wrist pain on the ulnar side AND cmc/thumbs?  I have some that are ok but my left wrist is so bad no amount of n said and a soft brace will get it feeling ok enough not to wake me up a bunch of times at night, and I can barely hold a coffee cup in thr morning.

What does it mean?,"Three years ago I was on match and this guy fairly local to me contacts me and said he paid the membership fee just to message me. We message then swap numbers. Have great convos for a couple of weeks and arrange to meet for a walk one Sunday. In the days leading up to the meet I felt something was off, I think his communication just pulled back. I said to a friend 100% he’s going to cancel. Sure enough he cancelled on the morning, he says because his brother in law had just been admitted to hospital. We have a brief back and forth where I express my sympathy and say let me know when things are good for you and we can rearrange. I never hear from him again. As the ball was in his court, and I had felt the cancellation coming in advance, I didn’t push it, because I wasn’t convinced his reason for cancelling was genuine.

Three years later the same guy contacts me on hinge, again saying he paid his membership fee just to message me (I’m aware you can message 8 people a day before having to pay the fee on hinge, so he could have just waited until the following day to message but I don’t say that). 

He expresses that he had no idea we had been in contact before. Says he can’t even remember what he did yesterday. Says he genuinely paid the fee to message me both times and reasserts that his brother in law was really sick. We message back and forth on hinge, even though we’re contacts for each other on WhatsApp, and we tentatively arrange to meet for coffee (his suggestion) then when it’s his turn to message and confirm the finer details of the date, he disappears from my message list on hinge, so I assume he’s deleted me or something or could have deleted the app.

I checked out his identity online and verified he is who he says he is. He works for a major media company and appears to have his shit together from what I could see online. He doesn’t appear to have blocked me on WhatsApp.

This macbook pro 2010 that I am tried to update holds a special place in my heart as it is the first mac computer that I have owned.

I still have skype installed on it, and have patients who are younger than it, that is how old it is.

All the other macs that came after do not appeal to me, whether it be the lack of connectivity: no 3.5mm, really? and now the ugly receeding hairline notch on the new ones.

The last OS available for this MBP is 10.13.6.

I usually only use it for data logging whilst roasting coffee, and very light word processing tasks so that has not really bothered me.

But with more and more programmes dropping support for 10.13.6, I needed to upgrade to maintain even basic functionality.

Following the very well written guide on the opencore legacy patcher github, I managed to install sequoia with opencore.

Problems I encountered during the installation:

* The first usb installer stick I created did not work. USB boot did work, and I could use the disk utility and safari whilst in the installer. However, when I press install, it says something along the lines of the installer does not work and please try again later. I downloaded the installer again, and recreated the USB installer and for some reason it worked. I guess computers work in mysterious ways, and it is totally reasonale to try the same thing and expect different outcomes.
* The first time the installer rebooted, the default booted my original high sierra desktop, which caused some confusion.
* The installation took a long............................. time. In the order of 6-7 hours. Thankfully much of that I need not be there, it was just the progress bar slowly crawling across the screen.

Things that work:

* All the root patches are installed automatically because I created the installer using the opencore patcher.
* Wifi, the built in touch pad and keyboard works.
* Both USB ports work.
* Built in speaker and microphone works.
* Screen brightness control works.
* Keyboard backlight controll works.
* Charging works is slower than before the upgrade, but I think that is from the increased power consumption of running the new OS, and I no longer have a original magsafe charger to test.
* I have only used it for less than an hour now, but not discovered any show stopping problems. Admittedly I am not fully in the apple ecosystem, and do not have an iphone to test mirroring, imessage, facetime etc. But so far Everything just works!

Things that do not work:

* After the first boot after the installation, my little 2 core CPU was pinned at 100% for hours, but eventually it finished what it needed to do. Now every little thing I do would peak the CPU to 100%, but I guess that is just the way it is.

* GPU acceleration in neither chrome nor safari. I kind of expected that, because it never worked in 10.13.6 neither due to nvidia and apple falling out.
* parsec, crashes on launch and just displays a blank window. Not done any research on getting it working yet.

I always counted myself lucky that at least it was ants and not roaches. Until a few weeks ago..

I saw my first roach in the kitchen 3 weeks ago. I had Advion roach gel on hand because I use the ant one religiously so stocked up on the roach version just in case. I put it in a few spots around where I saw it (the counter next to the fridge, I didn’t get to kill it because it went down the wall behind the fridge). I left on a trip for 2 weeks so prayed the Advion did its job while I was away. I got home 6 days ago and didn’t see any signs of more. I thought I was in the clear. But then 4 days ago I was making coffee and I saw one again in the same spot on the corner counter that connects the stove to the fridge. Again, it went behind the wall/fridge after crawling on my Nespresso machine for a second. 

I immediately went crazy with the advion, putting it in every corner, by the cabinets, behind the appliances and under them. A few hours later, I saw one dying on the floor nearby. I hoped it was the one I saw that morning and that I only had one. 2 days go by and I didn’t see any so hoped I was safe.

I was cleaning the kitchen counters with Lysol and one appeared on my Nespresso machine. Now I’m pretty sure it’s inside the pod catcher and am honestly terrified to look inside to clean it out.
I have extreme ocd with contamination obsessive thoughts and also pest ptsd from previous carpet beetle and now ant infestations. I have a deep cleaning routine I do every Sunday. I just cleaned the Nespresso but I know there is one pod in there from using it this week. I genuinely feel like I want to move out at the least, and move to the mainland in the freezing cold where they won’t survive in my most drastic scenario lol. 

Long story short, how f***** am I? The apartment won’t do anything because it’s Hawaii and this is normal. Every friend, family member, and coworker I’ve talked to rolls their eyes at me when I freaked about seeing just ONE. They laugh and say at least it’s the small ones and not the b52s. It’s just normal here and something you have to coexist with. 
But I’ve never had them in my house. Sure, I’ve seen them at work and outside, or dead in the apartment hallways. But never inside my unit. To my knowledge, this is the first sighting but I know it’s naive to believe they are new. I have not seen any nymphs, droppings, they haven’t been in the pantry. All 3 sightings were the same color/size and same location on the corner kitchen counter on or near the coffee maker.

I have half a mind to throw out my Nespresso now and my toaster even to be safe. But I can’t really afford a new one but my sanity is breaking after just 3 sightings in 3 weeks. Terrified the problem will worsen but also accepting I can’t control my neighbors or what’s in the walls no matter how clean I am. Trying to adapt the hunters mindset like I did with the ants, but right now I’m stuck in victim. 

I guess just looking for advice or reassurance that success is possible. I do have a cat so worry about certain pesticides. I haven’t moved any appliances out but have looked under and don’t see anything. I think the anxiety of what I could find is scarier than not knowing.

Not even something like coffee. I personally think that relying on drugs isn't a good way to live and that just having fun is what we all should be doing. Regardless some of my friends do some of these drugs. Nothing too hard just weed and drinking. I wouldn't even have a problem with it but the problem is they do it all the time. Like every weekend they do it and it's gotten to the point where we can't even hang out. They'll all go to one of my mates houses get super drunk for two days then Sunday they'll recover so we can't hangout. I'm still school age (I lied about my age in the title I'm actually a far bit younger) and attend school far away meaning it's an hour and a half drive everyday so I xant even hangout with them after school. I just feel like I have no friends and can only see them during school. I thought about trying to find new friends but aside from being really hard all my options either drink or smoke or both meaning I just have the same problem. When I say everyone I mean everyone. I am the only person I know that does t do it and I just don't know what to do. How can I cope with all this? What can I even do??

TL;DR all my friends drink and smoke but I don't want to do that. They drink and smoke so much they have no free time to hangout with me and I don't know a single person who doesn't drink or smoke so I have no idea what to do.

I took two Zofran and it didn’t help, and the smells from the kitchen were making my heart rate skyrocket. I keep thinking maybe it was from brunch earlier in the day — I had a sugary coffee, then a martini, and later shared a bunch of plates w friends. When I got home I had a mini slice of pizza, some sour grapes and then sushi with my sister (she’s fine though, we shared food). My stomach doesn’t usually get upset, and honestly I don’t even think it’s upset now — it just feels like nausea from anxiety. But then my anxiety spiked again and made my stomach hurt, and now I’m spiraling. It’s so frustrating because I have a flight tomorrow, so this is the worst timing.

I’m 24 M, an engineer, and recently started working here in BGC. To be honest, the job itself isn’t really the tiring part, it’s the commute, the rush, and all the small things in between that really drain you at the end of the day.

Back in university, it was so easy to meet people. You had classmates, orgmates, events, and there was always a reason to talk to someone new. But now, it feels so different. Work keeps you busy, everyone’s moving fast, and dating outside the university suddenly feels ten times more difficult.

Sometimes I wonder, how do people actually meet others here in BGC? Is it just as simple as approaching a girl you find interesting in a coffee shop, or starting a random conversation with someone along High Street? Or is that weird already in this kind of setting?

I guess I just wanted to put this out there and maybe hear from people who’ve been in the same shoes. How do you build a social life here beyond just your coworkers? Because honestly, it feels like a whole new world where everything is work, eat, sleep, repeat.",12,1756628281.0,BGC_Taguig,8,0.78,False
