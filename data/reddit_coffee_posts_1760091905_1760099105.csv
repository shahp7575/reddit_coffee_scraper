I am soon 18 in the next couple days and I‚Äôve had this idea lurking in the back of my mind since the start of the year. The idea is to start a business where people can rent rooms for the purpose of entertainment, as in they can use the room to watch TV, play games with rented equipment I would supply and enjoy time with friends. This is the basic version of what I envision, I‚Äôd like to make this into something where the attraction isn‚Äôt only the room but like a bar set up with tables in the main area where I can host game nights, karaoke, serve drinks and food etc but I need to start small to see if people would even want to pay for this so definitely just start with the room renting idea.

In theory I have a pretty good idea on how I would make this happen but I have no idea how to start. I have Eu Portuguese passport and citizenship, is the UK even the best place to start a business like this? I think it is idk. What type of space do I rent? I‚Äôve had people tell me I can maybe talk to community centres or shops with basements and see if I can strike an accord where I give them a percentage of my earnings. Would this be a good idea? Would anyone even agree on doing this? I‚Äôve thought this through so much but I feel at a loss but I really wanna make it happen. I understand my idea isn‚Äôt particularly revolutionary but I live in the north of England and everyday I feel like other coffee shops there is a serious lack of third spaces where specially young people can go and actually choose what they want to do.

I‚Äôm currently doing an apprenticeship that pays rather well for my age in a promising field so there‚Äôs some money there. I‚Äôve also told the idea to my family who are very hard workers and they were very supportive said they‚Äôll help however they can. We are definitely not rich and have actually struggled financially quite a bit and often but I feel like we‚Äôll be able to pull some cash together if this is something that could actually work.

I am soon 18 in the next couple days and I‚Äôve had this idea lurking in the back of my mind since the start of the year. The idea is to start a business where people can rent rooms for the purpose of entertainment, as in they can use the room to watch TV, play games with rented equipment I would supply and enjoy time with friends. This is the basic version of what I envision, I‚Äôd like to make this into something where the attraction isn‚Äôt only the room but like a bar set up with tables in the main area where I can host game nights, karaoke, serve drinks and food etc but I need to start small to see if people would even want to pay for this so definitely just start with the room renting idea.

In theory I have a pretty good idea on how I would make this happen but I have no idea how to start. I have Eu Portuguese passport and citizenship, is the UK even the best place to start a business like this? I think it is idk. What type of space do I rent? I‚Äôve had people tell me I can maybe talk to community centres or shops with basements and see if I can strike an accord where I give them a percentage of my earnings. Would this be a good idea? Would anyone even agree on doing this? I‚Äôve thought this through so much but I feel at a loss but I really wanna make it happen. I understand my idea isn‚Äôt particularly revolutionary but I live in the north of England and everyday I feel like other coffee shops there is a serious lack of third spaces where specially young people can go and actually choose what they want to do.

I‚Äôm currently doing an apprenticeship that pays rather well for my age in a promising field so there‚Äôs some money there. I‚Äôve also told the idea to my family who are very hard workers and they were very supportive said they‚Äôll help however they can. We are definitely not rich and have actually struggled financially quite a bit and often but I feel like we‚Äôll be able to pull some cash together if this is something that could actually work.

I‚Äôve looked at all the legal stuff needed and it seems doable. My family already has a personal accountant so that‚Äôs something checked out the list. I honestly just want opinions and constructive realistic critiques (I know there tend to be some debby downers on this app) but I‚Äôm open to being told this a stupid idea so that I can at least put my mind to rest but I‚Äôll be even happier if I‚Äôm told this may actually work lol. I definitely didn‚Äôt explain the idea as well I wish I could but i just have so many ideas on this that I forced myself to compact it and simplify it

I hope this reaches as many people as possible, and    I‚Äôm able to find clarity‚úåÔ∏è.",1,1760098329.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

My department had a formal, and J and I ended up talking the entire time (and connected really easily), but it never went anywhere at the end of the semester bc 1) I was dealing with some personal stuff 2) I was super stressed over finals and 3) I probably self-sabotaged by being too dry (bc of 1/2). I'm doing much better now, and I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to text J and ask if he wants to grab coffee or something?

1o2yzn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/astoria/comments/1o2yzn1/my_experience_working_at_a_coffee_shop_in_astoria/,My experience working at a coffee shop in Astoria,"Sorry super long

I want to share my experience working at a coffee shop in Astoria because I think customers and the community deserve to know what really goes on. I went back and forth on whether to share this, but I decided to be honest about my own experience. I‚Äôm not trying to attack anyone, I just want to shed light on what really happens at a cafe that claims to be ‚Äòall about community

From day one, we were told that we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really take breaks.‚Äù My boss said we could eat while working, as long as we were still helping customers. Shifts were often 9 to 10 hours long, with no official breaks. When we tried to rest on a stool between rushes, management removed it, saying it looked ‚Äúmore professional‚Äù and would prevent us from getting ‚Äúbored‚Äù so we would ‚Äúclean more.‚Äù Almost a year into my job, my boss casually mentioned, ‚ÄúSorry I never told you, but you‚Äôre allowed a 10-minute paid break.‚Äù That was the first time a break was ever mentioned to me and my coworkers from my store.

On multiple occasions, our boss made remarks that many of us found inappropriate or just straight offensive, including comments that could be perceived as racist/ homophobic. These comments of course created an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment.But since we had no HR department or formal reporting process, we had no safe way to raise concerns. When employees made discriminatory or hurtful comments, they were often dismissed, sometimes even laughed at. For example, a coworker once asked another employee about her background. When she said she was Mexican, he responded, ‚ÄúYou Mexicans are taking all our jobs.‚Äù When our boss was informed, the response was laughter and, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how he is. Don‚Äôt make a big deal over something silly.‚ÄùI also experienced gender bias firsthand. Women were often held to higher standards, while male employees were allowed poor work habits or inappropriate behavior. Seeing this minimized by leadership was discouraging.

When I asked for a pay adjustment to match the updated NYC minimum wage, I was told the company ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt go by the state‚Äôs minimum wage‚Äù and instead ‚Äúgoes by what servers get paid in the area.‚Äù but we are baristas not servers so this doesn't make sense to me...¬† not only this but the tipping situation was a whole other situation. Tips from all three stores Astoria, Sunnyside, and Woodside were pooled and split between baristas at all locations, even though customers tipped for service at their specific shop. Management claimed it was ‚Äúeasier for payroll‚Äù and promised a new process by January, but nothing changed until May. Even then, there was never a clear explanation of how online or pickup order tips were handled. We never received benefits despite nearly a year of consistent work. Everything was handled verbally and inconsistently. I was fired over text just days before reaching my one-year mark, without any written warnings, meetings, or formal write-ups.

Later, my boss claimed I had been written up before, but I was never informed, shown, or asked to acknowledge anything in writing. I experienced this firsthand when the day before I was terminated, I simply asked about the schedule, and her response suggested nothing immediate was happening. I was then let go the next day.

Communication was one of the biggest problems. My boss often contradicted herself and gave unclear instructions. If I asked my lead for clarification, they would tell me one thing, and she would later say another. I suggested that updates or policies be posted clearly in the group chat or sent through email so everyone would stay on the same page. Nothing changed. When I brought up store issues or asked about things like tips or pay, the conversation was either brushed off or delayed. It often felt like I was being ignored for speaking up. After raising concerns about scheduling, lack of communication, and the tipping system, I noticed a clear change in how I was treated.

After our store manager, who had been at this location for three years and played a key role in keeping operations running smoothly, was unexpectedly fired, the store‚Äôs organization and communication quickly deteriorated. Responsibilities fell on the lead barista without additional support or compensation, creating a stressful and disorganized work environment.

Customers would tell us problems such as flies, broken lids/cups, and missing items. We would pass these issues on, but they were rarely fixed and made a priority by my boss. I stayed at this job not for the company, but for the community. The regulars were loyal, the customers were super kind, and my coworkers genuinely cared about the people we served. Truly, the customers were some of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met in my years as a barista in New York City. That connection is what made the job meaningful.

The store was often disorganized and understaffed. Employees were overworked, breaks were frequently skipped, and questions about pay or tipping were met with vague or dismissive answers. Staff faced burnout without recognition, and communication from management was inconsistent at best.

In a small business, especially in a diverse city like New York, remarks and behavior from management should never make employees or customers feel unsafe, unwelcome, or disrespected. This is particularly important when staff or customers are people of color or LGBTQ+. Unfortunately, that was not always the case. You would think a small company would have more hands-on care for staff and customers, but the reality was often the opposite.

I‚Äôm sharing this not to attack anyone, but to be honest about the workplace. No one should have to work long hours without breaks, feel unsafe, or risk losing their job without proper notice. I hope this provides an honest look at what happens behind the bar of a business that claims to be ‚Äúall about community.‚Äù

As the title suggests, I'm currently bike shopping and have been looking at Canyon and Van Rysel models ‚Äî brands I know and trust. But my local bike shop has a pretty solid discount on the **Superior RR 9.6**: ‚Ç¨3199 instead of ‚Ç¨3799.

It comes with **Shimano 105 Di2** and a **DT Swiss ERC 1600 wheelset**, and I've heard some good things about the brand, even though it's less well-known than Canyon.

My main goal is to use the bike for coffee rides, bring it along on vacation trips, and maybe do the occasional recreational triathlon.

Does anyone have experience with this bike or Superior in general? Would you go for this, or stick with more popular brands? Appreciate any thoughts!

I‚Äôve had my Vertuo for a couple of months and have really liked it so far. Last week, when I closed the machine with a pod in, the red light started blinking. I opened it, reclosed it on the same pod, and it brewed just fine.

Since then, though, it‚Äôs been really loud, there‚Äôs a noticeable clicking noise during brewing. The coffee still comes out fine, but the sound is annoying and definitely louder than before.

Has anyone else run into this? Is it something that can be fixed, or should I be looking to return/exchange it?

I‚Äôd power through mornings on coffee and skip breakfast, then crash hard around 2 p.m. My brain would feel like it was wrapped in cotton. I felt foggy, slow, and unable to focus.

At some point, I started tracking my meals and noticed a pattern. Every crash came a few hours after a carb-heavy snack or a long stretch of not eating. I didn‚Äôt need therapy or another productivity hack. I needed stable blood sugar.

Now I eat a real breakfast (protein + fat + fiber) and keep lunch balanced instead of just grabbing something fast. The difference? No more afternoon brain fog, no more random irritability, and my focus lasts the entire day.

So, what really happens? When blood sugar spikes and crashes, your brain literally runs out of steady fuel, leading to fatigue, anxiety, and poor concentration.

It‚Äôs wild how I spent years trying to ‚Äúfix my mindset‚Äù when the real issue was physiological.

https://preview.redd.it/v4w9belrx9uf1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa98ddf43d794fac0a0a7f681691baae25f0a20



Basically, companies need to keep their ‚ÄúSDS Ducks‚Äù in a row. For this, staying on OSHA‚Äôs good side isn‚Äôt just about wearing hard hats‚Äîyour Safety Data Sheets (SDS) need some attention as well. Here‚Äôs how modern workplaces stay compliant without losing their sanity (or risking a citation).¬†

# 1. Go Digital or Go Home¬†

Manual binders are so 2010. Cloud-based SDS platforms let you:¬†

* Instantly access any sheet from the factory floor to the boardroom.¬†
* Push automatic updates when manufacturers revise hazards.¬†
* Audit who viewed what, when‚Äîbecause ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù won‚Äôt cut it.¬†

# 2. Tag, Track, and Tame Your Inventory¬†

An SDS management hero knows exactly which chemicals are lurking in every locker and lab station.¬†

* Barcode or RFID tags link inventory to SDS records.¬†
* Auto-reminders nudge you before ‚Äúthat mystery drum‚Äù becomes a compliance headache.¬†

# 3. Train Like You Mean It¬†

OSHA wants proof that your crew can actually read and use SDS info. Spice up your training with:¬†

* Short, scenario-based quizzes (‚ÄúWhat do you do if drum 47 starts sizzling?‚Äù).¬†
* Video micro-lessons on critical sections like first-aid measures.¬†

# 4. Audit Until You Drop (Checklists FTW!)¬†

Internal audits aren‚Äôt a fun surprise‚Äîschedule them quarterly to catch:¬†

* Missing or expired sheets¬†
* Mislabeled containers¬†
* Unread digital acknowledgments¬†

# 5. Keep That GHS Flag Flying¬†

OSHA‚Äôs aligned with GHS, so verify every SDS has:¬†

* Standardized pictograms¬†
* Signal words (‚ÄúDanger‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWarning‚Äù)¬†
* Clear hazard statements¬†

# 6. Liaise with Your Suppliers¬†

Don‚Äôt wait for the mail‚Äîget digital SDS delivered ASAP. A good supplier portal means:¬†

* Instant alerts when formulations change¬†
* Bulk updates to your SDS database¬†

# 7. Document Everything (Even Your Coffee Runs)¬†

In the eyes of an OSHA inspector, if it isn‚Äôt written down, it didn‚Äôt happen. Log:¬†

* SDS receipt dates¬†
* Employee training completions¬†
* Audit findings and corrective actions¬†

Let‚Äôs say, if you combine tech-savvy tools with solid processes (and perhaps a coffee-fueled checklist frenzy), you keep OSHA happy and obviously your workers safe. Now go forth and SDS-ify your workplace!¬†",1,1760097602.0,u_sayandas1998,0,1.0,False

Wonderlooper‚Äôs Real Indigo Blanket Series came to Redcast Heritage yesterday, and seeing how fast they sold out everywhere else you‚Äôll be lucky if any of these pieces are still in stock by the time I get this post up:

Pullover Crewneck
https://redcastheritage.com/products/wonder-looper-pullover-crewneck-real-indigo-blanket-striped-french-terry

Just for a quick refresher, the fabric is a custom-loopwheeled French Terry, weighing in at over 16oz. The outer surface is made from ‚Äúreal indigo‚Äù dyed yarns, while the interior has a pattern reminiscent of the blanket linings you‚Äôll find in some denim trucker jackets. It‚Äôs a cool design to be sure, and Wonderlooper obviously knows they‚Äôve hit on something pretty unique here, so the pieces are priced accordingly. I know there was a bit of controversy the last time I posted these, with folks lamenting the synthetic fiber content of $500-$600 sweatshirts. And yeah, I get it, they‚Äôre not for everyone, but they sure are for somebody because they keep selling out.

https://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/orslow-brushed-flannel-fatigue-pants-dark-navy

These are cut similar to orSlow‚Äôs Regular Fit Fatigue Pants with an ample straight leg, and moderately high rise. While they don‚Äôt give a weight on the fabric, you can be sure it‚Äôs heavier and warmer than their typical reverse sateen. And I just checked, these are also selling out quite fast. I feel bad, but Heritage fanatics simply love their heavyweight garments, so this uptick in quick sellouts is an unfortunate reality of the fall and winter in my experience. But don‚Äôt sweat it, these pants will almost certainly be stocked at additional shops soon enough, so if you want a pair keep an eye on the new arrivals pages of: Blue Owl, Standard & Strange, Canoe Club, etc.

New denim alert! ONI is back with a 13.7oz neppy masterpiece. The warp is a highly saturated, rope-dyed indigo, while the weft is a natural beige with neps poking through in abundance. And don‚Äôt worry, the fabric is still packed with ONI‚Äôs signature slub. These are texture monsters, and the perfect pair for anyone looking for their next fade project:

If you‚Äôre looking for something a bit more unique in the sea of black and brown belts, Samurai has released new natural indigo-dyed belts, and they are beautiful! There is no wrong choice here, you just gotta‚Äô decide whether you prefer the brass buckle or the silver:

Silver
https://dc4.de/new-arrivals/samurai-jeans-a301-ai-indigo-dyed-belt-silver-buckle.html

These are fairly substantial belts, made from 4mm thick Himeji leather, with a 37mm width. Not nearly as massive as Samurai‚Äôs truly over-the-top Curved Leather Belts, these are much more versatile, and perfect for wearing with your favorite heavyweight jeans, as well as chinos, fatigue pants, and most other trousers.

Fans of Bob Dylan, and folks who just like to be warm on the coldest of days will surely appreciate The Real McCoy‚Äôs authentic craftsmanship and attention to detail on this beautiful moleskin ranch coat:

https://www.fransboonestore.com/products/the-real-mccoys-moleskin-ranch-coat-brown-1

There‚Äôs no BS here, just a 100% moleskin outer, and 100% wool pile lining. If you‚Äôre looking for a jacket for the winter and not interested in being yet another N-1 Deck Jacket clad heritage bro, you could do a lot worse than this western workwear influenced piece in my opinion.

The other week I mentioned Brougue‚Äôs unprecedented lineup of Role Club Boots, and I felt this limited edition Role Club belt also deserved a shout:

https://www.brogueshop.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/role-club-belt

Made from a heavyweight teacore leather (black on the outside, brown on the inside), with a double prong buckle. This is a flat out badass belt for all your moto-influenced looks, or anyone looking for a beautiful piece that will keep your pants from falling down.

While I don‚Äôt see their pieces too often in fit pics, Wythe gets mentioned around here a fair bit, so I know they have their fans. Their fall/winter lineup this year is particularly nice. And if it‚Äôs not going to be me, I just really want someone to grab these purple jungle cloth pants:

https://franklinandpoe.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/wythe-deck-pant-dusty-purple

In an endless torrent of indigo, olive green, khaki, gray, and black, it‚Äôs good to integrate a little more color variety now and then, even in subtle ways. These pants are a perfect way to make that happen, even if they are made in China.

I'm 19m in college and I feel so alone and unwanted.
I don't even know where to start, these just so much going against me. I try and get out as much as a I can, but for one, i don't have a car so I can't go off campus easily and hang out at a library or go to some events, so that means for 95% of the time I'm stuck on campus (and my campus is in the middle of nowhere so I can't walk anyplace fun). Usually I go to the coffee shop or the library on campus just so I can get myself out there, but a lot of the time I'm stuck inside doing homework. And since I'm an animation major I have to be in the labs for school work, which are in the basement of a building only art students have access too, so I can't really do much there.
When I am out and about I stick to myslef but I try and do creative things, I'll do my homework that doesn't require the labs, I'll draw things, I'll 3d sculpt, I recently wrote an entire audio series, and I don't know if it's unrealistic, but not a single soul has said anything about it. Like I would have assumed at least someone would have been like ""that's a cool drawing, what's it for?"" (Then again I don't really talk to strangers in public, but it seems like that's a bad thing to do anyway by today's standards, idk).
But like the concept still applies, that nobody cares. Even my friends will do this too, I'll share something and they'll just ignore it. That raally sucks because they're all artists too, so I want to share my things with them and have conversations about it.
One thing I really hate that my friends do is they'll shot on men for no reason. Most of them are bi or gay or trans or nonbinary (I don't really care how they identify, they seem happy so good for them), but sometimes we'll be having a conversation and then one will go ""ugh I hate men"" and then they'll talk for the next 40 minutes about how all men should burn in hell. I never speak up because honestly what can I say? They're just gonna shoot down anything I mention by just saying ""yeah but all men are evil"" and that's not even exclusive to my friends! I hear that eveywhere, in public, on social media, in books, and it sucks. It really gets to me, because if it seems that modern culture is shiting on all men just because, what the hell am I supposed to do? (And yes I know some men are evil people, but they're also evil women and evil people in gernal, so what it gotta be so targeted?)
Idk I just feel so unwanted by everyone. People always say you need to have something to offer for people to want you. It seems that love has died and it's now a transaction where one party is except to provide everything while the other pretends to care about them all lecah all their stuff. I think I do have a lot to offer, I listen well, I care about people even when they're idealogies confuse me, I can entertain pretty well, I'm creative and my own person, I have hobbies. Yet when everyone looks at you funny for drawing on your iPad, how am I supposed to face that everyday with a positive outlook? It beats you down after awhile.
Another thing I hate about logic today is the ""you need to be perfect for someone to want you"" that's complete and utter bullshit. Perfection is a myth, it's never been, and never will be real. And even if it was, everyone has a different idea of what ""perfect"" is. I could think I'm perfect, but someone else could think I'm shit. Or even worse if you think your perfect, you're not attractive and confident, you're a narastitic douce bag. I don't want someone who's perfect. That's not good, I want someone I help grow, I want to be able to help someone see a side of themselves they haven't seen before, I want to help them and be the reason they change for the better. And I want that exact thing in return. Yet anytime I say that people always say ""b-but then you'll become fepent on your partner and you'll suck the life out of the, oh you don't love yourself! How can you even find someone who loves you if you don't love yourself, your just a leach who will only take and never give!"". It's like they didn't even hear what I said. Dependency isn't a bad thing, in fact I think it's good. I don't want a relationship, and eventually marage, where me and my partner are roommates who fuck. I want love. Real human love. And that requires dependancy. Not 24/7 not she puts in all the work while I do nothing. But a trade off, she does more work on my bad days, I do the same for her. We team up all the other times. We give %110 percent each day for the other person because we need them around. Yet when I say this I get crusified at the stake. 
Idk it all just feels so backwards, being a man=evil devil who needs to rot alone in hell. Having a different opinion, not liking hookup culture, and wanting real love=soul sucking leach who has no self respect or empathy for any other human beings.
Add this all up and it just feels that nobody thinks the way I do. No one takes the time to be creative in open spaces, nobody wants to commit to a relationship because it's too hard. Nobody what's to think about the hard topics and realize the common trend is wrong. 
And if all just makes me feel so unwanted and unlovable.

The manufacturer, Finish, truly raised the bar with their 75oz Lemon Scent gel formula. I couldn't help but notice how effectively it tackled stubborn food stains, including tea and coffee residue, even after they had been left to dry. Its performance left me both impressed and, frankly, relieved at not needing to pre-scrub dishes anymore.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
This gel detergent excels in its ability to deliver a deep-cleaning action on even the toughest grime. Stains that typically require soaking or scrubbing were erased effortlessly as the gel formula spread evenly over my dishware. Tea stains seemed to vanish within moments inside my dishwasher. That alone reduced the time I usually spent tediously hand-washing problem items. Combine this with the claimed ‚Äúshine boost‚Äù feature, and I‚Äôll admit, plates and glasses came out glistening.

**Ease of Use for Busy Lifestyles**  
A huge plus here is the convenience factor. Pouring this detergent into the compartment was simple; the gel didn‚Äôt drip excessively or make a mess. A single load meant I didn‚Äôt need to repeatedly refill or measure. As I sometimes multitask during chores, neatness and simplicity went a long way in making this product a preferred choice for me. The 75oz size lasted a significant number of cycles, making it practical for families or those who entertain often and go through many dishes.  

**Merits**  
- The concentrated formula removes difficult stains, managing coffee, grease, and lasagna residue.  
- Effortlessly leaves your plates sparkling without requiring pre-washing.  
- Long-lasting bottle size, perfect for heavy use.  

**Disadvantages**  
- The lemon scent, while fresh, might feel overpowering to individuals sensitive to strong fragrances.  
- Bulk packaging, although economical, can be slightly cumbersome to handle or store for those with compact kitchens.  

**Packaging and Design Insights**  
One thing I did notice was the sheer size of the product package. Measuring 11.69 x 8.58 x 4.33 inches, it‚Äôs a little bulky for smaller cabinets. Handling the 4.69-pound container is doable, but I found it slightly awkward at times, particularly when my hands were wet or slippery. Still, it‚Äôs a small tradeoff for having so much product conveniently stocked up. A better grip or nozzle feature would have been appreciated for better control while pouring.  

**Market Rivals**  
When comparing Finish Dishwasher Detergent Gel Liquid to its peers, such as Cascade or Seventh Generation dishwasher gels, the standout quality here is in its deep-cleaning prowess. Cascade often boasts comparable performance but lacks the remarkable shine Finish delivers. On the flip side, Seventh Generation appeals to users seeking eco-friendly options, but I‚Äôve found it to underperform against tougher stains. Finish strikes a balance, making it more reliable for households that prioritize both cleanliness and convenience.  

**Financial Value**  
Looking at the price-to-quality ratio, it‚Äôs clear this gel detergent offers affordable quality. While cheaper options exist, they don‚Äôt bring the same level of efficiency and results. Investing slightly more for a premium product means fewer rewashes and less hassle, which I found to be worth every penny. If performance justifies cost for you, this detergent holds up as a smart spending choice.

1o2yr3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o2yr3x/should_i_let_the_cheaters_brother_know/,Should I let the cheaters brother know?,"Should I let him know, i mean he did very bad too me and now seeing the pattern and everything he's put me through he will make me look bad infront of others to make himself look innocent, that's a kind of a guy he is. 

He cheated on me, manipulated me to the point where I was asking for forgiveness just to ask the truth, cheated on me, while he was with me for about 8 months, made a post asking ""where to take her for a 2 year anniversary"" I knew about that girl and ig she also knew about me and she's gonna get married to someone else, they both were doing this while being aware of what they are doing either FWB, i contacted that girl with shaky hands to let her know but she told me we are just friends and please don't contact me after this. 

When i confronted him he didn't said anything, didn't responded, didn't explained himself, that showed how much off a scumbag he is. 

Before all this there were clear signs, he lied to me since the beginning - we started talking online, after talking for a month he asked me to go on a date with him, soon he told me he likes me and sees a potential in this relationship, I too liked him and we started dating but as time passes and I got more curious, the suspicious begans once I asked him to show me around his work place ( told me he's a doc, but he sent me pictures that was downloaded from google and explained what was happening in those pictures as it was clicked during the present time, days later my gut told me to go and search that hospital online I did and the exact same photos were there uploaded 2 or 3 years ago ).

Confronted upon he told me he did it because I was constantly asking and he was busy with the workload, lane excuse so I told him I need time to rethink about this, he said he can show his id proof - showed me one card which didn't indicate that he works where he says he does, later he photoshopped his picture to make it look like he was at hospital, i caught that too. 

He said he's shy and can't ask anyone to click his picture and he wanted one out of his department, i sympathized and decided to give him time to be upon up to me about his work. 

Later i found he's been hiding his instagram stories from me, ik the trust gets shattered from here still my dumb ass decided to go on just because of ""love"". 

When i confronted about that he says maybe a glitch but it wasn't it had already happened quite a few times, he never made me meet his friends, but told me his mum and brother knows about me as he uploaded a photo of us holding hands and within those hours his friends didn't saw it but his family did and he got into trouble so he decided to delete that. 

I was getting very mixed feelings about him and they way he does this things so i texted his brother as he himself said he knows, but he got furious accused me that i ruined the relationship between him and his brother and his brother warmed him to stay out of this ( the conversation I had with him was barely nothing just simply knowing eachother and how we met, he was way too cool about it ) he told me about the relationship getting tarnished bw him and his brother when i stared confronting him about that girl, to make me feel guilty. 

Now the table turned and I was the one who apologised constantly for texting his brother and he was doing his best to make me feel guilty for contacting his brother, he liked seeing me apologizing continuously. 

Now after this he said he is ready to move forward and let this all leave behind, I too was tired and said yeah maybe we can start afresh and told him well what bothers me, he said he will acknowledge, the mistake I made here was that I went to his place after I had texted his brother and he was furious and very angry and i showed up unannounced, he told me to go away while closing the main door of his room for 5 mins and I was still there standing for him to come back so I can apologise, he came back, saw how it's scaring me, i told me him to let me sit and give me water i can't see your anger more than this it's making me scared and it has opened some traumatic events that had happened in my childhood and it was triggering alot, he understood and let me sit at his bed, i asked please hug me i need that rn, my heart is beating loud he did that, and while he was hugging me at the corner of his bed i saw belongings of other women and he told me come I'll drop you home and when I stood up I look at the end of his bed there were 2 full bags of women clothes and on top of that there was a sanitary pad, my heart skipped a bit but I couldn't confront him back then, i couldn't handle another fight  ( i should've leave him after that )

I was still talking to him on text we only met once before this another incident took place, I saw him with another girl at coffee shop when at that day he told me he's out of town, and at the very same day he told me we can start afresh when I come back. 

I asked him what was that? He told me he came back to town with his father and found that girl in the parking so she was just tagging along with him and his father was waiting for him at the next shop so he couldn't came up and say hi. 

Then I was emotionally lost instead of thinking rationally i was easily getting manipulated by him, found alot of things about that girl that she's into ONS, she actually may have live with him ( I feel disgusted with the thought that maybe whenever he comes to pick me up he first might have made sure she wasn't around and hid her stuff ) and to be still with me, he showed me a video claiming that girl has a boyfriend and that video contained that her bf is teaching her how two drive a car and later kissed her on the cheeks, he told me they have been together for years and about to get married so there is nothing to worry about. 

My emotional dependency and attachment towards him grew at a certain level and still decided to be with him, the same he showed me that video he went out with that girl the very same night as she bought a new car, the same very I told him to spend some time with me as I missed him alot and needed some love but he said he has to go to his hometown, again he went out with her and uploaded the pictures she might have clicked off him, when i asked lied to me and said he went out with one of his colleague, later i found the colleague he claims to be with wasn't even his colleague in a first place. 

After this all happened i wasn't thinking straight and kept asking him to tell me truth, he was emotionally abusing me to the point where he put a blame on me that i harrassed him when I told him to kiss me like he used too and put the blame on me for ruining his mental health and his therapist had to increase his medications, this all deeply affected me. 

I was again being sorry for what I hadn't put him through and it was a made up story that he made to look him innocent so I don't bring up that girl ever again, he made me feel guilty, said mean things too me, blamed me for ruining his relationship with his friends and family, the relationship i ruined with his friends was that i told him about that girls ONS and he acted blindsided and doesn't ever support any of this, he told me i barely meet them and now I can't even because of you and i ruined his relationship with his brother because i talked to him. 

Now being with that all he was still gaslighting me and trying to make out his way, i confronted him about everything again he lost his temper at the very same day i found his reddit account where he made a post in the city sub to ask where to bring her to celebrate their 2 year anniversary and called her car as his and there were pretty absurd comments in his previous reddit account before meeting me he had made comments about having sex, having FWB and being cheated on his previous relationship. 

When i asked him about his sexual history he told me he's still a virgin and that FWB comment he made so that it would make him look cool. 

Now on this reddit account he again said the very same thing and admitted having sex at 28 and is active at dating apps. 

I confronted him about this all via text as he said he will be not in the city till dec and might come to meet me in bw, but when I told him ik it all he choose not to respond, not to clarify, didn't even explained himself. 

At last I got my eyes opened up with the way he treated me and told him I'll go to your place and ask your landlord for the cctv footage which might have recorded her entering and going out and that should be enough to prove for all the lies, and cheating you did and cut him out complete. 

I'm shattered, I feel so disgusted that I loved that kind of a person who was promising me a future, he knew I had a hard childhood where I was SAd by my own father and he choose to put that blame on me, he knew i get triggered when someone shouts at front of me and I go numb, I can't tolerate a lie being told to me cause that made me question my own worth, I feel like i don't deserve love and i never will and no one will love me. 

He put me there back in which took me years to come out off, within just months, my gut never agreed to sleep with him, i always told him I'm not ready to have sex, even though if I was my expression turned him off and he said you aren't. 

Should I let his brother know, ik he might be happy and living his life with that girl, but what did I do deserve this? I was loving him, i never cheated, never lied, was always true to him, was always there for him. 

And his brother is getting married to a girl he's been with 5 years that's what love is, he compared their relationship infront of me and told me you can't maintain a long term relationship only because I have the ability to raise questions and confront him all the damn time because of his own actions. 

Would i ruin his marriage if I let him know? Would that deeply affecte their relationship this time for sure? I want him to suffer the way he made me suffer. ",0,1760097061.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

Even a short walk can change how we feel. The sound of water, the rustle of leaves, the fresh air on your face it all helps more than we realise.

Maybe take your coffee outside, sit by a window, or go for a walk and notice what is around you.

I tried every productivity hack TikTok could throw at me, pomodoro, notion templates, caffeine overdose until I finally this 10 strategies  
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been working FOR ME after 6 months of experimenting

**1. Time-block like you actually have a job**  
Instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll study later‚Äù, I plan study blocks on Google Calendar and treat them like real meetings. This short video helped me a ton:  
 [https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb](https://youtu.be/3s2gS3pFHPg?si=IqrgZHtma3TpiDIb)

**2. The ‚Äú5-minute activation‚Äù trick**  
When I don‚Äôt feel like studying, I promise myself *5* minutes only. That small start almost  
There‚Äôs some science behind it, it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúactivation energy‚Äù principle (worth Googling if you‚Äôre curious).

**3. Study with others**  
I started using [this site](https://www.studystream.live/home?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=13) it‚Äôs a 24/7 virtual coworking space where you join live focus rooms with other students. No talking, just accountability. Seeing 200+ people studying in real time kills procrastination, like you are in library

**4. Block distractions like your life depends on it**  
Apps like [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) and [Freedom](https://freedom.to/?irpid=56411&subId1=1-g-Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=56411&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=808733665&gbraid=0AAAAADLv4uSBNq1p5LzMwxGpG1MCeruAH&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59hh05xb2IZShD_m6lS1d-RfMCHXEJSPbPmD3qoIusw2i618xexT_gaAqI1EALw_wcB) are lifesavers, but honestly, the simplest hack is to put your phone in another room. If you want to understand why your brain keeps reaching for it, this video blew my mind: [Why you can‚Äôt focus ‚Äì Andrew Huberman explains dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY)

**5. Romanticize the process**  
Make your study setup feel good, clean desk, warm lighting, lo-fi beats, your favorite drink. It may seem silly, but the brain needs a lot of order.

**6. Reward yourself like you‚Äôre training a dog (because you kind of are)**  
 I set small rewards: finish a chapter: take a coffee. finish an assignment: 15 min scroll.  
 This alspo sounds silly, but it trains your brain to associate focus with pleasure.

**7. Keep a ‚Äúdone list‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúto-do list‚Äù**  
Writing what I completed instead of what I still need to do gives a crazy dopamine boost.  
I track mine in Notion

**8. Change locations once a day**  
Studying in the same spot drains you. I rotate between my desk, a caf√©, or my bed (controversial, I know). If you can‚Äôt leave home, just change the lighting or background music. it tricks your brain into a ‚Äúfresh start.‚Äù

**9. Mix subjects and methods**  
Alternate between reading, note-taking, and active recall. Active recall literally reprograms your memory [Ali Abdaal‚Äôs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE) explains it way better than I can.

**10. Lower the pressure, raise the consistency**  
Stop chasing the ‚Äúperfect study day.‚Äù Two consistent hours a day beats ten chaotic ones.  
I stopped aiming for motivation and started building systems.

We spend every Saturday together unless one of us has other plans with family or appointments and we usually have coffee after my work 2 to 3 times a week since she lives close to where I work and she is unemployed, so she has that time off.

So, I am not a social person despite how much I hang out with this friend. She is the exception, not the rule. And even though it rarely happens, sometimes I just feel very drained with work and so much socializing and when she asks to hang out after my work I'll go ""Not today, can it be tomorrow?"" or try and plan it to the following week so that I can go home at 6pm and just relax that day.
She always becomes very weird and will stop texting me for a day or two after that.

For example, I took the last three days of the week as vacation now because my parents are out and asked me to take care of a few things for them meanwhile. Sure, I had the days and I've been very tired, so I appreciate the time off, even if I have to run a few errands here and there.

I was with her after work on Monday and on Wednesday, the first day I had this mini vacation, I went with this friend on the afternoon as well. Then once I was home she asked for us to hang out on the second day and I said no because I wanted to take the time to relax and be home, since I never get the chance to. She dropped it, but soon after asked ""so tomorrow afternoon?"" and I said that I'd already said no and explained why, but it could be any other day. She then told me ""see you next week"", I asked if she'd be busy this Saturday and she told me that she didn't know.
That was two days ago and she hasn't talked to me since. Yesterday she did send something on messenger around 10pm but I was already in bed and left it be. It had been deleted this morning when I checked.

Honestly, how do you advice I deal with this? 
I'm too old to deal with the sulking, so I just ignore it until she answers me again and keep the conversation going as if nothing happened, but it annoys me a bit that it feels like she feels entitled to my time.

After a bit of experimenting (and a few fails), I pulled together what I‚Äôd call my *16 Must-Have Vegan Road Trip Snacks* ‚Äî stuff that‚Äôs easy, filling, and travel-proof.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs made the cut so far:

1. **Roasted chickpeas** ‚Äì crunchy, salty, protein-packed.
2. **Homemade trail mix** ‚Äì nuts, seeds, dried fruit, vegan dark chocolate chips.
3. **Energy balls** ‚Äì oats, peanut butter, dates, and a dash of cocoa.
4. **Hummus + veggie sticks** ‚Äì if you‚Äôve got a cooler, this one‚Äôs gold.
5. **Rice cakes with almond butter** ‚Äì quick, no mess, and surprisingly filling.
6. **Banana chips or dried mango** ‚Äì sweet and travel-safe.
7. **Vegan jerky** ‚Äì tempeh or mushroom versions are solid.
8. **Cold wraps** ‚Äì hummus, spinach, and roasted veggies.
9. **Popcorn** ‚Äì seasoned with nutritional yeast or chili powder.
10. **Granola bars** ‚Äì homemade or clean-ingredient store-bought.
11. **Apple slices with nut butter** ‚Äì simple, balanced, and fresh.
12. **Edamame pods** ‚Äì salty, protein-rich, super satisfying.
13. **Mini sandwiches** ‚Äì chickpea salad or tofu-based fillings.
14. **Cucumber + tomato cups** ‚Äì sprinkle of salt and lemon juice = perfection.
15. **Vegan muffins** ‚Äì banana oat or carrot ones hold up really well.
16. **Cold brew or matcha in a thermos** ‚Äì keeps you alert without gas station coffee.

I tested a few of these during my last trip, and honestly, they held up great. The roasted chickpeas and wraps were the MVPs.

I'm genuinely interested in getting to know people from different backgrounds, especially the wonderful women from Kerala (Mallu girls) who work in my area.

I've made a few attempts to start casual, friendly conversations‚Äîwhether it's been in the canteen, near the coffee machine, or during project-related interactions. My approach has always been respectful and professional, keeping the initial talk about work or casual, common topics.

However, I've noticed a pattern that's left me a bit confused, and I'd love to get some insights from the community here. More often than not, the conversation is extremely brief. I sometimes get a vibe that they are reserved, guarded, or immediately shut down the interaction, and it leaves me feeling like I'm hitting a cultural or communication barrier I don't understand.

I'm not looking to complain, but I'm trying to understand the perspective better.

Is there a general hesitation toward North Indian boys? If so, what are the common reasons behind it? Is it a language barrier (I speak English/Hindi, but no Malayalam), cultural differences, or perhaps stereotypes I'm unaware of?

Am I approaching this incorrectly in a professional setting like an IT park? Should I avoid attempting to strike up conversations altogether?

For the Mallu girls here, what makes you open up to someone, and what kind of initial approach feels respectful and welcoming to you?

For the North Indian guys who have made friends or dated, what was your experience, and what worked for you?

Finally, since I'm new to Coimbatore, are there any local social norms or contexts I might be missing in how people interact socially here? Any general tips for meeting people in the city would be great!

# Creature of Habit Finds Alcohol and Piss-Soaked Purgatory.

When I lived in London, I had my spots.

Hyde Park. Regent‚Äôs Park. Trafalgar Square, Eros fountain in Piccadilly Circus. Prime people-watching territory. The kind of places where you could scribble in a notebook, share a silent moment with a pigeon gambling its life against a double-decker, or have a strange five-minute chat with a tourist who thinks you‚Äôre local because you look permanently irritated.

Turns out my concentration face screams colossal bitch. A free accessory every Londoner owns, right up there with Oyster cards.

The worst thing that ever happened? A downpour. A street preacher with hellfire in his eyes. A pickpocket who chose the wrong target. Nothing you couldn‚Äôt fix with coffee and a muttered¬†*‚Äòfor fuck‚Äôs sake‚Äô.*¬†Annoying, but not memorable. Nothing that burrowed in and made permanent housing under my ribs.

In winter, I migrated indoors. Museums were my hideaways. The Science Museum, the V&A, the British: warm radiators, free entry, weird old shit to stare at while I scribbled or zoned out. No pressure. No sales pitch. Just space. Neutral space. Free to all; neutrality in practice, not in marketing.

And guess what? Nobody pissed on the parquet or shadow-boxed the mummies.

But my favourite was always The Hunterian. A haunted medical textbook you could walk through. Floating organs. Skinless figures mid-scream. Foetuses suspended like tragic jellyfish. Gruesome and glorious. No chairs, so your legs went numb, but worth it. No photos either, which somehow made it feel sacred.

Depending who you asked, you got different reasons:

* ***‚ÄòRespect for human remains‚Äô.*** Sure. Nothing says respect like jars of dead babies on display. Next to the gift shop.
* ***‚ÄòColonial ethics‚Äô.*** Fair. But don‚Äôt sell that line when half the jars were nicked from god-knows-where. Grave robbing with mood lighting. Hard to claim the moral high ground while displaying a shrunken head labelled:¬†*‚ÄòSouth America, c. Unknown‚Äô.*
* ***‚ÄòPreservation concerns‚Äô.*** Also fair, but my phone flash isn‚Äôt why the century-old bones look like they‚Äôve been through a tumble-dryer. It‚Äôs because someone mangled the fuck out of something or someone, whilst dead or alive, both plausible. Little more to it than this, obviously.
* **My personal favourite:**¬†***shrug, ‚Äòbecause‚Äô.*** At least that‚Äôs honest.¬†*‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô*¬†with jars of people.

# Why This Matters - Routines become Religion.

I‚Äôm a creature of habit. I liked knowing where I can vanish ‚Äî not to disappear. Without explaining, being pestered, strangers demanding a smile, or the stench of booze and bad decisions.

These places weren‚Äôt backdrops. They were neutral spaces.

* Bad day? Fuck it, park bench therapy.
* Uni or work stress? To the gardens.
* Too much noise? Museum silence, pronto.

It wasn‚Äôt just comfort. These were the places I could disappear without erasing myself. I could exist among people without being expected to perform. I didn‚Äôt give two fucks about performing. But the expectation that I should? That still fucks me off.

This moment exemplifies Judith Butler‚Äôs notion of gendered performativity under Foucault‚Äôs gaze. Where even non-participation becomes a form of resistance in a landscape saturated by soft surveillance.

I don‚Äôt think most people realise how much your body learns to scan for neutral spaces. Places that won‚Äôt demand too much. No performance. No threat. No pressure to smile.

In London I had them down to muscle memory: the corner bench near the lake; the gallery wing no one bothered with; the museum caf√©s with cheap tea and no faff; the little spot that did a brie and sun‚Äëdried tomato panini in Aldgate.

A city should feel like a worn‚Äëin pair of boots: a bit worm but comfortable.

1o2yaly,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/1o2yaly/music_complaint/,Music Complaint,"We have been at The Goddard School (yes, know they are a franchise and all are different) for a little now and I have to say I‚Äôm pretty disappointed.  We chose it because it‚Äôs close to home (and we both WFH), we liked their outdoor facilities and security in comparison to other places we looked at, and the fact that they had a professional cleaners come in to clean and didn‚Äôt rely on daycare staff to do it but mostly because they did have availability (even if we had to wait a year to get our kid in). But honestly as most people with kids in daycare know it‚Äôs all around, kind of a crapshoot.

Every morning during drop off and pickup (which I‚Äôve done at different times throughout the day during our time here) the kid are listening to adult pop music something like Backstreet Boys, Barbie Girl, Pink Pony Club, etc. not kid bop or censored. I honestly find this completely developmentally inappropriate for young children (my kid is a young toddler). I‚Äôve been hesitant to complain because I fear retribution and conflict with the teachers and my goal is to maintain a positive relationship with them, they are after all the one my kids spends a lot of time with, but I also do not want my kid subjected to this music. I know it‚Äôs out there in the world and I‚Äôm OK with him listening to it once in a while we at home expose them to all different types of music, rap, heavy metal, pop music, classical, rock, etc. BUT there‚Äôs tons of toddler music out there and some of it isn‚Äôt even repetitive or all that bad but this is never playing. I get that the teachers don‚Äôt wanna listen to this all day but they‚Äôre also in an educational setting but it‚Äôs a JOB and if they don‚Äôt want to listen to toddler music all day, then they could be in just ‚Äòsilence‚Äô, the kids don‚Äôt need auditory stimulation (background noise) all day long in that sense. 

Obviously, we could look into other daycare‚Äòs, but we will be on a waiting list and likely not able to enroll them until the next academic year August (hate that daycare‚Äôs are following a school schedule for young children. This just does not make any sense with adults working especially in a society that is trending towards ‚Äòtraditional parenting‚Äô in a political sense (even though no one can afford to live on one salary in our country anymore‚Ä¶) but I digress. I also lack the time and resources to check out more facilities and worry that we would end up in a place. That would tell us all the right things just to find out they don‚Äôt practice what they preach (like the Goddard School - outdoor play time everyday twice a day turned into ‚ÄòNo time outside because not everyone in his class can walk and it‚Äôs too much trouble to get everyone outside. An example of how music is not my only complaint‚Ä¶) 

We know how important the first five years of development and personally, I would give nothing more than to be the one who spends the most amount of time with my son but that‚Äôs not really an option in this society and our financial situation, nor am I sure that I am the best one to help him learn and grow in the best way possible. So looking for suggestions; do I complain? Let it go? Exhaust myself further and lose out on more time with my son searching for another facility? Hire a nanny so I essentially break even with my take-home pay (leaving me a question why I‚Äôm even working except for retirement benefits)? Open to any and all suggestions. 

Sorry about any typos and length (chronic over explainer‚Ä¶) not much coffee yet this am and using talk to text for typing.

As Daisy and Carter saw Clive‚Äôs ship meet a fiery crash, Daisy pulled on Flaremane‚Äôs reins, guiding him to the vessel.

As

*""We have to help them,""*¬†Daisy shouted.

*""Delay that,""*¬†Favian said over the communicator.

Daisy stopped Flaremane as she heard Favian.

""General Favian‚Äî""

""Damara, this is our last chance. If we don't destroy those generators now, that's it. This whole part of space falls to the enemy."" Favian interrupted.

‚ÄúBut Clive‚Äôs team was supposed to attack the third generator.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out later. But now we must hit the other two before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

Daisy looked at the fiery wreckage of the ship with teary eyes. She turned her gaze to Carter, awaiting his response. And he gave it to her with a slow, reluctant nod.¬†

Daisy sluggishly turned away from aiding her comrades.

""S-sir, yes, sir. We'll destroy our generator quickly and then cover Yara and Lieutenant Rogers.""

\*\*\*

Clive punched open the fiery ship from within at the crash site. As the hull burst, it revealed him with the others barely alive, dragging out as many of their injured comrades as they could. The United Planets soldiers went through the immense heat and the black smoke that attacked their lungs and dashed away from the ship. Clive carried thirty people on his back, Ros had ten, and Yara had five, as the other soldiers followed them to safety.

""I hope we still have some working comms. They need to know we're still alive,"" Clive said.

""Don't bother. Even if we died, it wouldn't affect General Favian. No matter what, Mission first,"" Yara said.

""Wow, this guy sounds like a jerk.""

Yara growled like a feral beast. ""You know, Rogers, I don't think I like you.""

""Well, now the feeling is mutual.""

""Both of you, stop it.‚Äù Ros pushed the lieutenants apart from one another. ‚ÄúWe're in enemy territory and running low on time.""

A plasma bolt flew at Ros. But as it was about to hit her head, Clive pushed her out of the way. The team quickly spotted the source of the attack. A detachment of Nemesis soldiers was fast approaching. And behind their enemies stood the power generator.

""No matter what, we need to get into that building,"" Yara said.

""Ros, are you okay with this?‚Äù Clive put a hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúI mean, these guys are your people.""

""Of course not, Clive. But it's like what Damara said. We're here to fight for the dream.""

""Alright. Then let you and me put them down quickly and painlessly.""

With a nod from Ros, she and Clive drew their weapons. Alongside her bo-staff, Clive's large mace was ready for battle. With them, the remaining United Planets soldiers prepared to meet their opponents. However, as the two were about to lead the charge, Yara stopped them with a hand to their faces.

""Everybody hold it. I get the first choice of the enemy. It's been too long since I had a good fight.""

In the blink of an eye, Yara closed the distance of several meters between her and the Nemesis. She tore into the enemy with beastly strength and speed, nearly becoming a black-and-white blur. Unleashing a flurry of blows on them, punching, slashing with her claws, and kicking, constantly changing direction faster than they could defend.¬†

Her comrades watched her battle, unable to turn away from the animalistic savagery and beauty of her combat style. But they soon regained their senses and hurried to join her. Clive and Ros led the charge as they cut through the Nemesis army. The two bashed one enemy after the next as they made their way to the building. Battling with such skill and harmony of movement, it was as if they had been training together for years.

""Wow,"" Ros said.

""Thanks, I‚Äî""

Ros threw her bo staff at a Nemesis soldier, sneaking behind Clive. As it stabbed him in the shoulder, Clive looked at her with a smile. But in return, she blushed red.

Together, Clive, Ros, and Yara led the United Planets soldiers, subduing the remaining enemies outside. They smashed into the building, knocking down the doors, meeting more opponents fiercely guarding the generator. Still, Yara rushed into the fray with her claws out. She slashed at the enemy left and right, more beast than a person in the heat of battle. The lieutenant mowed down a dozen enemies in a minute, inching closer to the generator. Suddenly, one of the enemies shot Yara in the shoulder, knocking her unconscious. But before they could finish her, Clive and Ros came over with dire speed. Clive punched out a Nemesis, training his gun on Yara. However, exhaustion and the enemy's superior numbers began to take their toll.¬†

The Nemesis beat them mercilessly until they were bloody and bruised on the floor. Still, with the last of his strength, Clive resolved to one final action.*""Choke on this.""*¬†He jumped to his feet and tossed his mace at the power generator. And as it flew across the room, it smashed into it, causing a massive explosion.¬†

Minutes later, Clive limped out of the building, carrying an unconscious Ros and Yara along with his other injured comrades on his back.

""One down,"" Clive said, coughing blood.

\*\*\*

Favian's ship landed near the second power generator. The Nemesis prepared to repel their enemies, forming a blockade around the building. The United Planets soldiers quickly exited the vessel for battle. And Sarah grew to a giant size to meet the challenge. However, as they were about to charge, Favian stopped them.

""Save your strength,"" Favian said.

He quickly marched to the vanguard, standing between his forces and the enemy, unfazed by their threat. The Nemesis prepared to fire on Favian, but still, he stood unfazed. As the ground started to shake, everyone learned the cause of his confidence. Summoned by Favian, a massive deluge drawn from the fortress‚Äôs water supply raced to them, quickly capturing the Nemesis in a colossal water bubble.

Sarah‚Äôs eyes widened, seeing Favian‚Äôs power. ""Oh, my gods.""

""I‚Äôll make this quick and painless,"" Favian swiped his trident across the air.

The Nemesis struggled as they tried to escape. But Favian held them in place as water filled their lungs. Swiftly, the enemies stopped moving, and Favian burst his bubble, dropping them to the ground dead.

""Half of you form a defensive perimeter while the rest of us go inside.""

""Sir, yes, sir."" The soldiers said in unison.

Hastily, the United Planets soldiers smashed into the building. The soldiers quickly shot at the Nemesis, and Sarah brought the fight to a swift end with one giant stomp on their skulls.

""Good work, Fortitudo,"" Favian said.

""Thanks, sir. Now, let's finish this quickly. There's someone with the med unit I want to get back to.""

Favian hurried over to the power generator. As he moved towards it, he stopped as the sounds of a massacre came from outside. The echoes of terrified screams and plasma fire traveled across the room, hitting their ears like glass shards. But swiftly, everything became as quiet as a grave, with his and Sarah's faces losing color from the deathly silence. In a flash of light, Cybertroopers burst into the room. They shot down their enemies twice as fast as the United Planets, littering the floor with their bodies.

*""Not again,""*¬†Sarah and Favian shouted in unison.

Favian tried to dash to the power generator, but one of the troopers shot him twice in the back. He dropped to the ground, coughing blood, but he struggled back to his feet. And with all his remaining strength, he staggered to his target. The troopers prepared to finish him, but Sarah intervened. She grabbed them all in her giant hands, restraining them to the floor. Still, as before, they released an immense energy field, trying to shock her away. However, even as her flesh burned and pain raced through her body, her grip was undeterred. Set like a boulder in her mind, she refused to relive what happened to Everton.

*""Not again,""*¬†Sarah screamed.

Favian staggered closer and closer to the generator, coughing up more blood. His vision became hazier with every step, but he soldiered forward. Until he reached his target, and with one mighty stab of his trident, it exploded.¬†

The building collapsed in a fiery explosion. But Sarah swiftly erupted out of the rubble with Favian and several of her surviving comrades in her giant hands. However, as her vision blurred and she fought to maintain consciousness, a realization came. She knew she was no longer fit for duty.

""It's all on you now, Damara.""

\*\*\*

At the center of the fortress, Daisy flew through the air, trying to reach the final power generator. But a deadly opposition was in hot pursuit. Squadron after squadron of enemies covered the air in devotion to murdering Daisy.

Through the air, her pursuers relentlessly bombarded her and Carter. As a storm of plasma bolts rained on them, Flaremane doubled his speed to evade the attack and reach their final destination: a colossal tower. But as the assault magnified, Carter drew his sword to clear a path.*""Take this.""*¬†And an energy slash flew from his blade as he swung it through the air. It cleaved through the enemies, alleviating their assault enough for Flaremane to make one final push to the tower.

With the path clear, Daisy‚Äôs vision was glued onto the tower even as the remaining enemies continued shooting. However, inching closer to her destination, she witnessed Cymbeline on top of it. And faster than she could defend, he shot a colossal fireball at them.

*""No,""*¬†Daisy said, horrified.

As the attack neared them, Carter spotted a window on the tower, making a grim choice.""I'm sorry, red."" He quickly picked up Daisy, tossing her at the window. She cut through the air with remarkable speed, crashing through the window into the tower. She evaded the shot as it hit Flaremane's wings, sending him and Carter crashing to the ground.

*""C-Carter, Flaremane,""*¬†Daisy shouted.

Daisy looked at their crash site, tears escaping her eyes, but she remembered Favian's words, forcing herself to continue the mission, running down the corridor.

\*\*\*

On the ground, Carter slowly regained consciousness in a pile of rubble. He sluggishly rose from it to be met with plasma fire from the enemy infantry. But as Carter dodged the attack, the general spotted Flaremane pinned under a pile of rubble as the shots flew by him, running to the stallion's aid. Carter hurried to Flaremane through the hail of plasma bolts. And as he freed him, he made the horse look him in the eye with a glare.

""Okay, horse, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But for Daisy‚Äôs sake, we need to work together.""

Flaremane returned Carter's glare, but as the gears of his mind turned, he remembered Daisy's smiling face. With it, he gave Carter a nod. And the stallion swiftly invited Carter onto his back to fly. Carter accepted his invitation, but as he climbed on, Nemesis infantry neared. Still, as they prepared to shoot them, Carter swung his sword, blowing them away with an energy slash. And the two hastily flew through the storm of plasma bolts above from aerial troops.

""Faster, horse, faster.""

Flaremane heeded Carter's command, summoning his speed. But as they neared the tower, the enemies swarmed them from all angles, blocking them. However, flaremane spotted another window, and a solution appeared in his mind with a smug smile.¬†

Carter saw Flaremane‚Äôs smile. ""Horse, what are you about to do?‚Äù

Flaremane gave Carter an answer. He flung him off his back to the window, smashing Carter into the tower. And alone, he kept the Nemesis busy as he covered himself in fire. Carter got to his feet and saw him grabbing the aerial troops‚Äô attention, blasting fire in every direction.

Carter cracked a slight smile. ""Thanks, horse.""",1,1760095214.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Within the Southern United Planets territory, jubilation raced through the night air. It was where ancient rivals, nature, and technology unified. Vast forests stood proudly as massive luminescent wisteria hung from the oak trees that covered their surface. It was a world of metropolises without pollution, emitting the sweetest scent. Planet Flora: the home of the butterfly people.

The trees towering above the surface of the planet at thousands of feet above sea level harbored settlements nestled within their great leaves. The natives hurriedly flew through their tree city, Luekia, carrying food and decorations for a celebration. But amongst the loud hustle and bustle, two individuals met for a quiet evening in a restaurant. In the Happy Summer Inn, Favian and Lev dined together.

The two sat alone by a table in the center of the room. As Favian sat before Lev, he gazed at her with his features hardening. He had told her over the holophone that he wanted to speak to her about business. But for reasons he couldn‚Äôt fathom, she took it as an opportunity to indulge in excess. Red lipstick adorned the warrior woman‚Äôs face, and a frilly , short-trimmed pink dress covered her body.

""How's your nectar soup, Favian?"" Lev asked.

""A bit sweet for my taste.""

""Live a little.""

""Easier said than done.""

Lev put a finger on her cheek. ""Suppose I can't argue with you there.""

A waitress came, placing a nectar sandwich, two slices of bread with oozing white flower nectar in between, before Lev.

""How I love the sandwiches here."" Lev grabbed her sandwich, taking a bite.

""Listen, Lev.‚Äù Favian ran his hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI came here to apologize before our next meeting at Headquarters.""

""Apologize? What for?"" Lev took another bite of her sandwich.

""Stop playing games. I understand now we'll need to take greater risks to win this war.""

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs brought this on?‚Äù

Favian rolled his eyes, knowing Lev was playing coy. ‚ÄúI suppose being shot in the back twice brought me some clarity.‚Äù

""Well, maybe now we can stop butting heads.""

Favian cracked a small smile. ""I'm sure we'll find something else to argue about.""

Lev giggled, but a smashing sound flashed through the air. The two generals hurriedly drew their attention to the noise, readying for battle. But they relaxed, seeing it was a broken vase from someone hanging up decorations.

""Lev, remind me, what's this holiday about?""

""The Grand Flower Festival is a celebration of love. There's even a ball planned at the spirit wisteria field later that I neglected to find a date for.‚Äù Lev sighed. ‚ÄúThe price of being a working woman.""

""Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you feel so much for my plight, why don't you help me?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúAccompany me. You wouldn't want me making a fool of myself, going alone, would you?""

The puzzle quickly came together for Favian as he heard Lev. With a few short words, she displayed the military strategy that compelled Orion to promote her to the rank of general. Lev was as beautiful as she was intelligent. She used his sense of camaraderie with a fellow soldier. Hundreds, possibly thousands of couples would be attending the festival. It likely would be immensely mortifying if Lev went by herself. It was clear to him now that she wanted their meeting to be more than business.

""I‚Äî""

Hastily, Lev‚Äôs Lieutenant entered the room before Favian could talk. Norn, twenty-eight, a beautiful, slender-bodied Moira, a humanoid species with bright red skin, silver hair, and geometric black lines running across her cheeks and forehead, hurriedly came to the table.

""General Lev, I hate interrupting your evening, but it's urgent.""

""Norn, did the enemy breach our defenses?"" Lev asked.

""Maybe, ma'am. We've received reports of unusual troop movement from the southern outpost. It needs your attention immediately.‚Äù

""Let's go."" Lev took out her money from her purse and was ready to pay for the meal.

""Lev, please allow me to pay.""

""But you‚Äôre my guest.""

""I insist. Please focus on this matter.""

""How gentlemanly. Thank you.""

Lev put her money back into her purse, and she quickly left the restaurant with Norn.¬†

Norn glanced back at the restaurant as they went. ""General Lev, I must admit curiosity is killing me. Did you and General Favian talk about anything important?""

""Just a matter of unfinished business.""

""I see.""

Lev signaled Norn to come closer, and as she came, she put her mouth to her ear to speak.

""But woman to woman. He's quite handsome, isn't he?""

""Speaking as one happily married to her husband, very.""

Lev laughed, hearing Norn, but the two soon reached the edge of the structure in the tree. Lev walked off the edge, falling to the ground thousands of feet below. But as she freed her wings, she rose upwards, cutting through the air. And Norn followed the general. She swiftly hurried across the chasm on a pathway of nearly invisible string.

\*\*\*

On planet Earth, the Lily boutique was filled with business. Many were returning patrons overjoyed to learn Daisy, Aisha, and Belle survived the Nemesis attack. Three months after Daisy and Carter returned from Planet Aqua, she kept her promise to her sisters. The young women returned to Liberty City and worked like never before to re-establish their company, aided in no small part by generous loans from Carter.¬†

Belle and Aisha labored over the sewing machines. The patrons browsed through clothes from men's to women's wear across various tables and racks. Daisy commanded the cash register, serving the long line of customers as Linus, a caucasian man of thirty, approached the counter with a black jacket.

""That will be two dollars and fifty cents. Please,"" Daisy said.

Linus reached into his pocket, but as he rooted in it, he quickly slapped his forehead.

""I just remembered. I didn't bring any change. I'll put this back.""

""Linus, you said you needed the jacket for a special occasion. Your nephew's graduation ceremony today?""

Linus nodded.

""Well, just take it and pay us later.""

Linus‚Äôs eyes widened. ""I don't know what to say.""

""It's no big deal.""

‚ÄúThanks, Daisy. This place is the best.‚Äù

Hours later, the customers left the business. Their demands were satisfied by the women's supply of wares as closing time came.

""Another good day. Great work, girls,"" Daisy said.

""A thousand more like this, sissy, and we might just barely dodge bankruptcy."" Belle wiped a stream of sweat off her brow.

""Chief, can‚Äôt you be a bit more positive?"" Aisha gently shoved Belle‚Äôs shoulder.

""I guess I'm still bitter.‚Äù Belle dropped onto a chair, rubbing her temples. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be here if the Nemesis didn‚Äôt rain hell on us. I swear to god, I‚Äôll hate them forever.""

Daisy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBelle, we‚Äôve had this conversation before, but please don‚Äôt talk about them like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why not?‚Äù

Daisy‚Äôs features hardened. ""Everton Blak was a great man, big sister, and a Nemesis.""

""Exactly. It's just like Ma David always says. Harboring hatred is an abomination to the lord.""

""I know, I know. I'm trying my best, but I'm so tired.""

Carter's car honked outside, and he quickly entered the boutique, carrying large fabric crates, one in each of his hands.

""Special delivery, ladies.""

Daisy ran to Carter, kissing him. But Belle stared worriedly at the large crates in Carter's hands.

""Is it safe for you to be up and about, pretty boy?""

""I feel like a thousand bucks.""

""But like a quarter of your body was burned.""

""That was before the doctors at the United Planets gave me this stem cell thing. Now my handsome self is back to firing on all cylinders.""

Carter glanced at his reflection in a mirror and worriedly focused on a big scar across his cheek.

""But I'm told I'd better get used to this scar on my face.""

Daisy swiftly, lovingly kissed the scar on Carter's face.

""Speaking of fire and burning, Daisy, how did you survive that big explosion again?"" Aisha asked.

""I coated myself in the protective flames and‚Äî""

Carter spotted Clive coming with the rest of the crates through a window. ""Red, tell the story later. Clive's coming.""

Clive quickly entered the boutique, and the group dispersed, attending to their jobs. But as Clive rested the crates in a corner, a table of scarves caught his eye. And he excitedly ran to Daisy and Carter, grabbing several.

""Daisy, are you busy? I need your help.""

""I can spare some time. What is it?""

""I need you to help me figure out which one of these scarves to buy.""

""I've been saying you should try something different from your standard dirty jacket and t-shirt. But a scarf, bud?"" Carter chuckled.

""It's not for me. There's a girl.""

*""Finally,""*¬†Daisy and Carter happily shouted in unison.

Clive clenched his teeth. ""What the hell do you two mean by finally?""

""We just want you to be happy.""

""What she said."" Carter motioned with his head to Daisy.

""Whatever.‚Äù Clive shoved the scarves in front of the couple. ‚ÄúDaisy, tell me which of these stupid things I should buy. I need a woman's perspective.""

""I'll do you better. Let me make you something from scratch.""

Clive's teeth unclenched, surrendering to shock. ""Great. But how much would I owe you?""

""Nothing. Consider it on the house.""

""I don't know.""

""Please, I insist. You're a friend, and this is a special occasion.""

""Well, if you say so. Thanks a ton."" Clive playfully punched Daisy‚Äôs shoulder.

\*\*\*

The boutique closed for the day. Daisy and the others left, heading towards Carter's car. But as they went, Samuel drove to them in his, and Aisha hurried to him as he came out. The two had been dating since Daisy and Carter returned from Aqua. Over the three months, Daisy happily took notice of Aisha‚Äôs smile when she was around him. Aisha had many boyfriends over the years of their friendship, but Daisy could tell Samuel was unique.

""Babe, I thought you said you would be busy the whole day?"" Aisha asked.

""I thought so, too. But they let me off the hook early.""

Aisha kissed Samuel with spirit.

*""Wow,""*¬†Samuel said.

""Now that we have free time. Let's go somewhere.""

""Sure, I‚Äî""

Samuel's heart skipped a beat, noticing Daisy and Carter. He looked at them as if he were in a trance, but as Aisha saw him, she snapped her fingers before his face, waking him.

""Babe, what's the matter?""

""I-I guess I'm still a little star-struck, seeing General Carter in person.""

""I'm just a guy, friend.""

""Of course. By the way, would you and Daisy be interested in a double date?""

""That sounds wonderful. But Carter and I were looking forward to some alone time. How's the next time sound?""

""Great. Thank you.""

\*\*\*

On Andrea Beach, Aisha and Samuel watched the waves crash onto the sand as he wrapped her in his arms.

""I must admit this place is quite beautiful,"" Samuel said.

""Isn't it? One of the reasons I wanted to move to the big city was to see the ocean.""

""What's it like growing up in a place like Kansas?""

""It's a lot different than a city. It's so much quieter. The land is prettier. And everyone takes a vested interest in one another.‚Äù Aisha placed a kiss on Samuel‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúLike a nosy family.""

""Is that how you got so close with the Davids?""

""I was always friends with Daisy and Belle. But after Mommy died, they became my sisters, and Ma David like another mother.""

Samuel released Aisha, dropping onto a bench and panting.

Aisha quickly ran to Samuel. ""What's wrong? Are you hurt, sick?""

""When you mentioned your mother, it brought back some bad memories. Mine died in a fire a long time ago.""

""My god."" Aisha placed a hand over her mouth.

""I took this job, believing it could help me. But now and again, the memories return as vivid as the day I saw them.""

""I've been there. But it's just like Ma David always says. God can heal any ailment, mental or physical.""

Aisha hugged Samuel, and he quickly reciprocated, gripping her tightly as if terrified of losing her.

\*\*\*

Daisy and Carter picnicked under the oak tree in Sir Justin Park.

""Carter, how are my sandwiches?""

""Delicious.‚Äù Carter took a bite of a sandwich. ‚ÄúYour cooking keeps getting better and better, red.""

""Try the egg salad?"" Daisy took a container from the picnic basket, offering it to Carter.

""Don't mind if I do.""

Carter stretched over to Daisy with his plate. She scooped a large share of egg salad, dropping it on it. As he took a bite, Carter grew a big smile, moaning in satisfaction.

""I'm glad you enjoy my cooking so much. By the way, thanks again for the money. We'll work hard to pay you back soon.""

""Don't worry about it, red. It's the least I could do for my girl.""

Daisy laughed, hearing Carter. But as she went to take a bite of bread, she stopped, growing a frown.

""Carter, we need to talk.""

""What about?""

""It's been months since we visited Ma. And since then, we haven't been intimate.""

""Here we go again."" Carter dropped his plate.

""I know, but you‚Äôve been such a gentleman. And I can't help but feel so guilty about you doing so much for me, and I can't return the favor.""

""Daisy, I have you locked down, and that's enough for now.""

Carter looked at Daisy from top to bottom, admiring her beauty.

I have an anxiety disorder and ended up in the ER 6 months ago due to a Panic Attack. Instead of listening to my story, the doctor measured my blood pressure and told me I have severe hypertonia (180:100). 

So for past 6 months Ive been taking candesartan 8mg at night. Always felt like garbage in the morning and my endurance during physical activities starting to decline, despite me doing lifestyle Changes (no Coffee, No Alcohol, no fastfood). 

Three weeks ago a friend and I went to the gym. Im 31 Male, by the way and always used to work out in my 20s. After 20 minutes on the treadmill I was completely gassed, sweating like I ran a full marathon. We hit the dumbbells and after 3 Sets of chest, I barely could catch air so I had to cancel our workout.

Went to the doctor next morning, my BP was 110:67. Told him that I had a severe decline physically and that I dont know what it is. So he put me on a bike and found out that my heart wasn't doing 100%. He asked me if I was taking medication, I told him about the ER prescription. 

He counted 1+1 and said , we need to do a 24 hour measurement. Said and done, my BP during the night went to clinically dead lows (rhetorically) and I had spikes when my anxiety disorder striked, which is perfectly normal. 

He told me to taper Candesartan Off from 8 to 4 to 0. Said and done, 1 week I am completely off of medication, my condition is improving, my BP is still spiking, but is perfect 70% of the day and I feel amazing.

Long story short, don't take medication without having a full check. The ER Doctor basically made my life an horror for 6 months, just because I trusted status quo and never Made a full check Up afterwards.

For my friend Sarah is bisexual and she‚Äôs transitioning from a boy to a girl so yes a trans girl but her dad won‚Äôt accept and she has a lot of family issues with her dad and hadn‚Äôt seen her mom in years because apparently she was crazy so her dad got custody of both Sarah and her sister. Anyways Sarah has been really depressed lately and won‚Äôt eat anything and it was getting worse and worse now there‚Äôs a the science teacher Sarah confides to whom we‚Äôre going to call Ms. Smith for privacy reasons. Ok there had also been friend group drama to top it off since Sarah‚Äôs girlfriend left her for her ex and they had a crush on eachother since fifth grade and Sarah was really bitter about it since Sarah‚Äôs girlfriend and her ex dated in seventh grade and then they broke up and in the middle Sarah asked her out and she said yes. Back to the story with all of this going on Sarah became more and more depressed. Sarah first didn‚Äôt sleep one night and was drinking coffee all day super tired in school then the next day she brought a beer to school and said hey look at the beer I have and I thought he was just joking but he showed me in his bag he had an unopened can of beer. I was like Sarah what the fuck you shouldn‚Äôt do that don‚Äôt do that again and he said I will unless if I start smoking weed then I‚Äôll stop which made me extremely concerned and her friend next to her Rosie was kinda enabling it since when Sarah said I‚Äôll drink it next period during gym class although I didn‚Äôt have gym class with him this made extremely worried since she‚Äôs the type to actually do it and she went along smiling with yasss. I didn‚Äôt want Sarah to go down the route of suicide and such so I told Ms smith even though Sarah told me not to and now ms smith is going to talk to Sarah but I feel like an asshole even though Sarah is refusing help but my mom thinks it was asshole of me because now she might be expelled or suspended and Sarah won‚Äôt tell me her family issues and yeah I feel horrible since I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve made the problem worse ,1,1760093503.0,AITH,4,0.67,False

Brewing the perfect cup of drip coffee starts long before the water touches the grounds. It begins with¬†**how you grind your beans**. The¬†[right coffee grinder¬†](https://gomehedi.com/best-grinder-for-drip-coffee/)can transform an ordinary morning brew into something extraordinary ‚Äî aromatic, smooth, and balanced.

Many coffee lovers underestimate the importance of grind size consistency. However, if your grind is uneven ‚Äî with some coarse chunks and some fine dust ‚Äî your extraction becomes unbalanced. The result? A cup that‚Äôs either bitter, sour, or flat. That‚Äôs why the¬†**grinder**¬†is the most critical piece of coffee gear after the beans themselves.

# The Science of a Perfect Drip Grind

Drip coffee typically requires a¬†**medium grind**, somewhere between table salt and beach sand in texture. This size allows water to flow evenly through the coffee bed, extracting flavor at the right rate. If the grind is too fine, your coffee will be over-extracted and bitter. Too coarse, and it will taste weak or watery.

The¬†[best burr grinders](https://gomehedi.com/best-burr-coffee-grinder-for-french-press/)¬†are designed to produce a uniform grind size every time, ensuring consistency with each brew. Electric grinders make the process even more effortless ‚Äî ideal for busy mornings.

# Blade vs. Burr: The Crucial Difference

You‚Äôve probably seen two types of grinders on the market ‚Äî¬†**blade grinders**¬†and¬†**burr grinders**. Blade grinders chop coffee unevenly using rotating blades, while burr grinders crush beans between two abrasive surfaces for uniform results.

For drip coffee, burr grinders are the clear winner. They provide consistent grind size, better flavor, and allow precise control over coarseness. Blade grinders, on the other hand, tend to generate heat, which can alter the bean‚Äôs natural flavor oils.

I‚Äôm planning my second trip to Japan, focusing mainly on Tokyo and nearby cities (Kanto region and maybe a bit beyond).
During my first visit, I covered plenty of iconic spots ‚Äî it was amazing, but this time I‚Äôm after something very different:
I want to uncover the hidden gems, underground corners, and everyday beauty that most tourists never see.

I‚Äôm hoping to hear from people who‚Äôve really lived Japan ‚Äî locals, expats, or anyone who‚Äôs done a proper deep dive into the culture.

‚∏ª

üéß My Vibe & Deep-Dive Interests

My interests are a bit niche, leaning toward the artistic, musical, and slightly offbeat side of Japanese life:
	‚Ä¢	Music: jazz kissas (especially those run by old-school owners), underground punk/live rock venues, progressive rock or folk scenes, and hidden vinyl record stores with rare finds.
	‚Ä¢	Art & Culture: small contemporary art galleries, independent collectives, and spaces that capture Japan‚Äôs modern urban soul.
	‚Ä¢	Wellness & Spirituality: authentic onsen towns (less commercial, more local), and shrines/temples with ties to Japanese mythology and folklore.
	‚Ä¢	Subculture: places blending underground and everyday life ‚Äî think Koenji, Kichijoji, Asagaya, Nakano, etc., where creativity thrives quietly.

‚∏ª

üóæ What I‚Äôve Already Covered (to avoid overlap)

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what I did during my first trip ‚Äî mostly the ‚Äúessentials‚Äù and a few semi-local spots in Tokyo:

Neighborhoods / Culture:
Shibuya Scramble, Harajuku (Takeshita, Laforet), Shinjuku (Kabukich≈ç, Golden-Gai, Godzilla Head), Akihabara Electric Town, Yanaka Ginza, Yoyogi Park, Shimokitazawa vintage shops (KINJI, WEGO).

Temples & Shrines:
Meiji Shrine, Kanda Myoujin, Tenn≈çji Temple, G≈çtokuji Temple.

Music & Stores:
Tower Records Shibuya, Disk Union (Ochanomizu), Ishibashi Music, Akihabara‚Äôs record/game shops.

Caf√©s & Food:
Meikyoku Kissa Lion, Shibuya Nonbei Yokocho, Coco Ichibanya, Shiro-Hige‚Äôs Cream Puff Factory.

It was a great introduction ‚Äî but now, I‚Äôm looking for something deeper, quieter, maybe even weirder.

‚∏ª

üîé What I‚Äôd Love Your Expert Insight On

I‚Äôm looking for your deep, personal recommendations ‚Äî the kind that don‚Äôt usually make it to blogs or travel guides.
	1.	Neighborhoods / Small Cities:
Which lesser-known Tokyo districts or nearby cities (like Yokohama, Kawagoe, Chichibu, or others) truly capture that local everyday rhythm ‚Äî places tied to music, art, or underground culture?
	2.	Accommodation:
Any ryokan, boutique guesthouse, or creative Airbnb where you‚Äôve had an authentic, personal connection ‚Äî rather than a polished hotel experience?
	3.	Music & Vinyl Culture:
Hidden jazz kissas, live houses, or record stores for Japanese jazz, punk, or prog rock lovers?
(Bonus if they still use reel-to-reel or vintage audio setups!)
	4.	Onsen & Spiritual Escapes:
Local onsen towns within ~2 hours from Tokyo ‚Äî not the fancy resorts, but the ones where locals actually go.
Also curious about shrines or temples connected to regional myths or legends.
	5.	Food & Drink:
Your go-to hole-in-the-wall izakayas, nostalgic kissaten, or local-only coffee bars where time slows down.

The insights I found were interesting.,"You see in the first half of the day (8-10 AM) is when people go to work or start their day. They usually buy americano which is a strong coffee helping people get through the day.

While post 5pm, Latte sells the best. Latte is a popular and comforting choice for those who prefer a less bold coffee flavor, this means people come for dates or meeting friends, basically want to chill.

So now if you run a cafe and see this trend this is what you can do:

1. In the mornings, until 11 am you can run a combo offer of Americano coffee with snacks like biscotti, donut, bagel (something that pairs well with Americano) this will help you upsell and earn more, while keeping your clients happy at the same time
2. In the evenings you can run incentivising offers for couples and group of friends on ordering Latte's (buy 1 get 1, or 20% off on select food items)
3. Music plays a big role (look up why restaurants play music) you can play high BPM music in the morning for runners, corporate crowd. While soft and cozy music in the evening for couples and people who have come to have a good time.
