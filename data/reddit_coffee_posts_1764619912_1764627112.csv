1pbqi0p,https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/articles/-/368752?page=1,"[All Japan] Kento Miyahara condemns Saya Kamitani & OZAWA aiming for the MVP of the Professional Wrestling Award ""Isn't it strange?""","Shitty machine translation: 

All Japan Professional Wrestling ""The best of the best"" Kento Miyahara (36) urgently proposed a ""ban on lobbying activities"" at the Professional Wrestling Awards. The content that also involved Stardom's Saya Kamitani (29) and Noah's OZAWA (29). 

In the early morning of November, when the full-scale cold began to arrive, Miyahara urgently summoned reporters. When he appeared somewhere in Shinjuku Ward, ""Isn't this year's professional wrestling award strange?"" He started talking to the reporter.

It is true that this year's Professional Wrestling Awards are overheating more than usual. Kamitani, who is aiming for the first women's MVP, will directly negotiate the vote for Kenta Kobashi, who will serve as a special selection committee member from 2021. OZAWA also avoids the extant statement, but he is taking actions like ""under the sleeve"", such as handing over the castella to the reporter.

Miyahara condemned the two, saying, ""Professional wrestlers who are aiming for awards are not good."" Aren't professional wrestlers showing their cool side by fighting in the ring and appearing in the media? Was the wrestler I admired as a child, such as Hulk Hogan, aiming for the award? It's not like that, is it?""

He argues that the actions of top wrestlers such as Kamitani and OZAWA will create a vicious cycle in the industry. Five or ten years later, the players who admired the two will do the same thing. And I think it will become a ""small world view"" more and more,"" he said, saying that in the future, even the authority of the award may be lost.

In addition, in response to this newspaper, which publishes the article, ""Mr. Higashispo will also write interestingly about the players. I had to stop it, so I called you today,"" he said.

""The prize is ""chosen one"". Even if you don't make such a candidate , you will come to a good player who represented that year,"" Miyahara said. So far, the reporter was convinced and nodded, but ""Well, that's Kento Miyahara this year,"" the words that made me doubt my ears...

Then isn't it like a muzina in the same hole? When I followed it like that, ""It's completely different. Mine is my advice. Because is there a ""People's Champion"" like me? In the first place..."" and the bragging story that was not special began, so I passed the conversation halfway.

When he realized it, Miyahara, who had a clear expression, finally offered a can of coffee to the reporter with an upward look that seemed to appeal to something, ""It's suddenly getting cold, so be careful of a cold."" How is the MVP's whereabouts...

The wind was whistling through the exterior corridor, carrying with it the gentle rustling of tree branches from the forest stretching behind the motel. The lights hanging at the ends of the hallway were dangling mindlessly, barely making any difference in the quickly decaying daylight. Harris was bent over the railing, staring blankly at the road ahead. He didn't even bother to look at the cars that passed every once in a while, just letting the cold breeze smoke the cigarette between his fingers. After his small fit, him and the Sheriff tried to collect every piece of information that seemed useful from that wretched house. After walking around the lower level for a while, dusting the place for fingerprints and picking up small objects to be sent to the Morgantown PD lab, they gathered their courage to go upstairs. They broke every rule in the book and Harris knew that. But he also started to feel like no one actually cared for it except himself. After witnessing the bloodbath in the kitchen, he felt like he started feeling more at ease for whatever this case could throw at him. And he would have done anything to not have to see that scene anymore.

Luckily, the upstairs looked more normal, judging the circumstances. No red stains or... pieces, that is. Besides the mostly non-existing roof, and the wood poles that lay broken on the bathroom and bedroom floors, the place looked remarkably intact. In the coat that was still hanging to the closet knob in the bedroom he found Dean McConnell's wallet, with ID and money still inside. He also found the small safe tucked away behind the large wood desk, which was untouched. After putting the desk back in its place, Harris checked the leather-bound notebooks that were laying on it. One of them was full of recipes, one contained small mementos, phone numbers of close relatives, passwords and what-not. The third one wouldn't have caught the Deputy's attention normally. After hastily checking a couple of pages, he noticed the tone of the writing was very mundane, and at times the handwriting was barely legible, as if McConnell was talking to himself. Most probably a diary, Harris thought to himself. He then noticed the timestamps. Recent timestamps. The latest entry was on January 29th, which Pineville S.D. estimated as the date the murder happened.

Harris winced when he felt the sudden burning sensation in his fingers. The light in his cigarette was already way past the filter line. He rubbed the butt on the corridor railing and threw it in the standing ashtray beside him, and went inside his room. He took a long look at the state of the place. The rancid, moldy stains on the ceiling, the translucent windows not made so by design, but lack of care, the carpet that he suspected was older than him, and the bedsheets that embodied the very essence of beige. He looked at the notebook on the small metal table by the window. While the rest of the evidence was now probably in the Sheriff's office, Harris insisted he take the diary for further inspection. He checked his wristwatch: too late to phone his wife. And he knew that sleep was a distant wish that couldn't be fulfilled. Not tonight. Not after what he saw. So he sat down at the metal table, and opened the notebook.



January 22nd

Finally, I'm here. Drive to the cabin felt endless, especially once I crossed the county line. Who would have thought there would be so much traffic going to West Virginia in the middle of winter? I appreciate the care that we always had when leaving the cabin, though. Every time we came back everything was in order. I hate the feeling of entering a house that remained unoccupied for longer periods of time. Things tend to be out of order, as if the mere absence of people dirties the place.

As suggested by doctor Rodriguez, I am writing this journal as a way to unload my thoughts and emotions. She suggested that I come here for a few days, write everything that goes through my mind. Or what goes through OUR mind. She didn't specify whether I should address these messages to myself, or imagine that I am talking to someone else. I'll just see where this leads.

Come to think of it, this might be part of the exercise. Maybe writing it the way I feel in the moment and addressing it much the same will help ease these feelings. Anyway, I am pretty tired now, it's been a long day. I'll go fix up the gas tank under the stove and get something going. Bought some essentials down at the grocery store on Main Street, and I'm feeling steak with green peppercorn sauce for tonight. Probably going to go straight to bed afterwards. So bye, journal, I guess?



January 23rd

03:12 AM

I can't fall asleep. I tried to force myself, and even though I feel like my eyes are going to melt away, I can't actually push myself over the edge. I just rolled around in bed for a few hours, struggling between freezing outside of the blanket and sweating profusely under it. I should have brought my laptop, even though doctor Rodriguez convinced me otherwise. She said it would distract me, cloud my thoughts. Cabin never had a TV, at least as far as I know, and only brought one book with me. Not a very good choice, tried reading a few pages, but it doesn't seem my style. So I guess writing is my escapism this night. Decided it might be better to write down the time for each entry in the journal. That way I can keep track of my thoughts. Doc said to let myself flow over the pages. She said to write about day-to-day life, but most importantly to write about what I feel deep down. About what bothers me, what hurts. But it's hard to do it. Never really opened up about these things to anyone. Baby steps, Dean, baby steps.

Tomorrow I'm planning to do some setup around the house. Or today, rather, I forget what time it is. I should unpack my bags, sort out the boiler for the hot water, bring out the wooly blankets from the storage room, setup the kitchen. Planning on improving some recipes that I've been working on for a while. I hope I can add that duck confit with blackcurrant reduction and cedar-infused rosemary to the menu when I get back to the city. But that's a problem for tomorrow. Or today. I'll try to go back to bed.

04:47 AM

I keep thinking about her. I miss her, so much. I know that's normal, but I just can't really accept it. I know it happened, but I don't want that. I don't want it to be true. I just wish I could pinch myself and wake up from this nightmare. I would even try to go to sleep with the hope that through some weird dream logic I could get back to the real world. To wake up next to her, watch her sleep peacefully next to me, like I've watched her so many times before. I don't know how to express it, it just feels like this huge pressure in my chest, and whatever I do, it just doesn't go away. I go to the restaurant and drown myself in work, trying as much as possible to avoid going back home. I stopped video calling my mom because of the fear of seeing her look at me with those sorrowful eyes. I just wait for her to check up on me, and I am tired of hearing the pity in her voice when she asks me how I'm feeling, knowing fully well how I'm feeling. I go shopping for ingredients and try to smile back to the cashiers, but it just doesn't work. I know this might seem like the weirdest thing to pinpoint, but it feels so weird right now. It is such a natural thing, smiling. Pretending to be happy, to be content. I feel like I can't even pretend anymore.

I never would have believed I would end up here. Even when the doctors told us the diagnosis, I couldn't even imagine. In my head, the plan was simple. Lots of TLC. She would take the sick leave, I can support the both of us. A bunch of procedures, X-rays and what-not, until the chemo started. Even when it was close to the end, and I was standing on the edge of that hospital bed, holding her feeble hand, watching the color drift from her face over the days. I still had all the hope in the world, because even in those moments she would smile, tell me that she is feeling somewhat better, and that she loves me. She always was the more optimistic of the two of us. She was weak, yes, but didn't it work like that? The treatment attacks the tumor, but it also attacks the rest of the body. And then everything will be fine. Right? When it finally happened, I wasn't even fully aware of it. The doctor warned me that the treatment wasn't really working to plan, and that the disease was most likely spreading again. But during the day-to-day trips she seemed... okay. She was moving more, talking more. She wasn't eating, she said the chemo was killing her appetite. She tried having a few mouthfuls of the food I brought with me from the restaurant. She said she could never pass on my ragu. I couldn't, or wouldn't, recognize the light that was slowly fading from her eyes as the weeks dragged on. In the very end, I think she just let go. Gave up. Whenever I close my eyes at night, I picture her in that final moment. Her green eyes, so full of joy and candor, now turned dull. Her face thinner, her almost transparent skin wrapped tightly around her cheeks. She pressed on my hand to tell me to get closer. She could barely even whisper. I still don't know what those few last words said, before she closed her eyes.

08:03 PM

Cooked the duck. Still not there yet, sauce is too sweet, needs more acidity. Shouldn't put lemon though, maybe I can try a bit of balsamic. As you can see, I didn't really have time for writing today. Or, as I can see. Still not sure how to address this. Did a bunch of stuff around the house, and after I was done with the prep work for the recipe I really felt like having a break. Went for a walk down the holler, almost reached the old Company Store before it started getting dark. Got back up the moment I saw the light dimming. No electrical lighting on the holler, and I don't really want to take the chances of getting face-to-face with a wolf.

Last night I fell asleep writing, basically passed out. Woke up around 11:00 AM, feeling even more tired. But I couldn't sleep anymore, my back was hurting again.

I found the old radio while looking through the living room cupboards, I completely forgot about this. It was nice having something to listen to while cooking, even if there are only two stations available and one of them is mostly static. Hopefully it will help me feel less lonely these days.

I should probably head to bed now, it's been a long day, and I feel like I will have more luck with the sleep tonight.



January 24th

09:00 AM

Was right about the sleep. Most restful night I've had in the past few months. Found a half-full bottle of maple syrup while looking for the coffee pot. Going to whip up some pancake batter and fry some bacon in its honor.

15:24 PM

Just got back from town. Had to pick up a few things for the carbonara tonight. Pineville isn't really known for its guanciale, but I guess some garlic cured ham will do. No Italians around here to judge. Also met Otis, the Deputy. He told me there was a blizzard warning, supposedly it will hit tonight. He asked if I wanted to get a room at the motel, on the house, but it's more comfortable here. After the talk with him, I went back to the grocery store to double down on the food and household supplies. Now I have enough toilet paper and batteries to last a full winter.

22:47 PM

Well, Otis was right about the blizzard. It's hailing ass outside, and the wind beating against the side of the house is almost deafening when staying in the kitchen. It's weirdly calm, though. The whirring and beating sounds help muffle my thoughts. I'll do some reading before going to bed.



January 25th

06:22 AM

Just got done talking to Otis, he wanted to see if I was ok. Called the police last night, something weird happened. Most probably some punk kids snuck around the cabin, trying to scare me. I was downstairs in the kitchen. Even though the blizzard is still ongoing, there was a timeframe of about one hour when the wind was more gentle, and I could see the thick snowflakes landing more peacefully in the total darkness outside. At some point, I heard some ruffling outside. I turned off the radio and got up, put my ear against the wall, pretty close to the front door. I didn't hear anything for a few moments, but then it came again. I was pretty sure it sounded like footsteps.

I peeked through the curtains of the kitchen window, but couldn't see anything. I waited a couple of minutes, but couldn't hear anything else, so I turned the radio on again, went back to the crossword puzzle I had laying on the table. It's quite weird when you are focused on something, and then you pull back from it, even for a split-second, you realize that some things you were internalizing as being part of your own mind are coming from outside. That's what happened to me after I looked up from the puzzle, considering if I should pour a glass of wine. I realized that a specific rhythmical beat that I was hearing was not coming from the song on the radio. There was beating on the cabin's wall. \*Bang\* and then a moment of silence, followed by another \*bang\*. It was the sound of something small, but hard, hitting wood. I turned the radio down. The sound came again.

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

These mountains are full of wolves, bears, deer and other game meat. But they don't usually venture close to towns, even the more isolated hollers, like this one. Never heard of a bear beating on a house trying to get in around here. And they for sure cannot maintain a rhythm like this. There was a person outside of my house.

I listened for a few more seconds. I didn't turn off the radio, I didn't want to let the intruder know I was aware of their presence. And I realized the beating was now coming from the kitchen wall, and was slowly making its way towards the front of the house. As it turned the corner, the beating picked up the pace, just a bit. Just barely perceptible. There was a \*bang\* every few inches along the wall, and I was following it, pacing carefully to not let the floorboards creak beneath me. The moment the beating reached the window to the left of the front door, it took a brief pause before resuming on its other side. What I thought was weird in that moment, what I still think is weird, is that I couldn't see any shape or shadow in that moment. The curtains here are pretty thin, and normally you would be able to see the shape of another person walking outside, even at night.

\*bang\*

The door resounded.

\*bang\*

I could feel a slight increase to the force of the knock.

\*bang\*

I walked up to the door and carefully lifted the visor. I couldn't see anything, too dark. I should have left the porch light on. Or maybe the person knocking was crouched beneath the visor.

\*bang\*

I could feel the force of the knock at the height of my chest. Without realizing it, I knocked back.

There was a pause, and then it came.

\*bang\*

I hit again.

\*bang\*

\*bang\*

I knocked harder.

\*bang bang bang\*

\*bang bang bang\*

I thought the guy must be mocking me. I yelled ""Hey! Stop that!"".

The knocking stopped. I put my ear against the door. I waited for what felt like a good few minutes. And then

""Hey!""

The voice on the other side was quite high. Sounded clean, but somehow unsure. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Hey!"" it sounded a bit deeper, a bit more raspy than before. ""What do you mean hey? I asked who are you!"" I yelled back. ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" I could hear the three words coming from different sides of the door. There wasn't just one guy.

""Get out of here, before I call the police!""

""Stop that!"" said one of the voices.

""Hey! Get out of here!"" said another.

Those guys must have been crazy or something. There was a barrage of sounds coming from the other side of the door, and the knocks resumed, now even more intense. I could barely hear Sheriff Waylon's voice on the other side of the phone while I asked for a house call. My mind was filled with those voices.

Hey! \*bang\* Get out of here! Hey! Stop! Get out of here! Police! \*bang\* Stop that! Hey! \*bang\* Get out of that! Call the police! I call! Stop! \*bang\* Hey! Get here! Out! \*bang\* Call the police! \*bang\* Hey! Hey! Hey!

The voices stopped soon after I finished the call. I ran upstairs and took the gun from the safe. Locked myself in the bedroom, and hid behind the desk, gun ready. At times, I could hear some sounds outside. What must have been footsteps, followed by the occasional ""Hey!"". What really shook me, however, was that they sounded remarkably similar to my voice now. Not the way you hear your voice in your own head, but the way you hear it on a recording somewhere, and you get disappointed because it never sounds the way you think it sounds, the way you want it to sound.   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

\*bang bang bang bang bang\*

The hard knocks woke me up from the trance I slipped myself into. They sounded tougher, more determined than even the ones before.

""Hey! Dean, you in there?""

I opened the bedroom door and crept down the stairs, looking around the house for any intruders.

""Dean! It's Otis Bailey from the Sheriff's Department! Are you in there?""

I could see the red-blue flashes of a police car peering through the curtains. Looked through the visor on the front door to see the figure of Otis standing on the other side.

Those intruders left before Otis got here, at least from what he told me. He took a good look around the house before knocking on my door. He saw some footprints around the house, which he showed me. There were indeed multiple sets of indents in the snow, circling the house back and forth, but the blizzard started picking up, and the wind was starting to cover the prints with snow. However, Otis pointed out that there was at least one set of prints leading away from the house, up the holler towards the old mine. Told him everything that happened. He assured me it must have been some kids, trying to prank me. I asked how can there be kids out in this kind of weather. He just shrugged. He asked again whether I want to go to the motel in town, but I refused. Apparently the blizzard will keep going for another few days.

Anyways, I'm pretty tired now, and could really go for some food. I'll get started on some breakfast.

12:15 PM

I hate this snow. It's been snowing non-stop for the past couple of hours. It's so cold that I can't even ventilate the place properly. I can only open the windows for a couple of minutes at a time before feeling like I'm freezing. It's especially bad after I cook, and I'm trying to get the smell out of the kitchen and living room. Kate asked me to fix the vent hood last year, when we noticed it wasn't pulling it's weight while frying some sausages. Should have done it then. No way I can fix it now.

14:34 PM

I'm starting to get really bored in here. Maybe I should have taken Otis' offer of driving me to the motel. At least I would be closer to everything else. At least I would get to go to a shop to see some people. It's very lonely being by yourself in the heart of the mountains here. Guess I never noticed it. I always came here with Kate, and it was the perfect getaway after months of work and busy schedules. We could come here, just the two of us, as a sort of romantic escape. No people, no responsibilities, just us.

23:17 PM

I spent the last few hours finishing the book I took here with me. Bought it a couple of years ago, when I went to a bookstore in Chicago with Kate. She told me it was her favorite book. I've never been much into horror myself. Read some Lovecraft and King in my sophomore year in high school, my friends were really into slasher movies and the likes. This one was really nice, though, especially the second half. I guess I like cosmic horror more than I thought. I predict that I'll have the image of an old, scrappy-looking wizard trying to fish out a leviathan out of a creek etched into my mind for a long time.

Had quite a lot of wine for dinner, I think I'm going to call it a night.



January 26th

04:15 AM

I just saw Kate in the house.

Of course, I didn't actually see her. It's just that I had the most vivid dream ever. I woke up to get a glass of water from the bathroom, and when I opened the bedroom door I saw her, standing there in the darkness of the corridor, her back towards me. I could see her figure pretty well in the silver moonlight protruding from the window. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, as she usually wore it around the house, and I could see she was wearing the earrings I got her for our first anniversary. She refused to wear any other ones. She said it helped her hear our hearts beating even when we were apart. She always was good with words, had a way of making my heart melt with every compliment.

I could see her hands moving by her side. She was slowly flexing and relaxing her fingers, as if her palms fell asleep. She was testing every finger, going back and forth between them. In that dreamy haze, I called out to her. ""Hey..."" that's all I could think of. I never dreamt of her after what happened. I guess it was a way for my brain to give me a bit of peace, at least while I was sleeping. I could see Kate stiffing her neck, but otherwise didn't move. A few moments later, I heard her respond in my own voice ""Hey!"". Next thing I know, she darted down the corridor into the small storage space next to the bathroom. At the same time, I drunkenly limped back into the bedroom and fell into the bed. At the same time, I woke up, sweating, heart pounding. I just started calming down. Don't think I can fall back asleep though.

08:32 AM

Indeed, couldn't fall asleep again. Still thinking about the dream I had. I guess I didn't want to let the rest of a night's sleep wash away the memory. Despite the almost disturbing setup of the dream, I am happy I can dream of her again. I spent the last few hours thinking of her, of us. Too much to put onto paper. I remember, during one of the first therapy sessions with doctor Rodriguez, she asked me if I could pick one memory of Kate that I loved the most. At that time, I told the doc that I couldn't possibly pick just one memory, that I would take any memory with her, be it good or bad, if that meant I could experience it with her.

Now, I think I finally chose a memory. When we were still quite young, when we had just moved from being friends to a full-on relationship, Kate invited me over to watch a movie at her place. We both laid down on the bed, blankets and stuffed animals all around us. We were stuffed from the homemade burgers we had cooked together. We flipped over the channels, until we landed on an Italian movie. At least as far as I remember, it was Italian. The movie depicted a first date between two people. The intriguing part, though, was that besides the date itself, the movie also showed the dialogues between each person's internal voices, as they were making decisions, thinking about the other person, and so on. The movie was pretty good, and we laughed a lot. I spilled red wine on Kate's bed, and I still hope she forgives me for that, but all-in-all we had a really good time. Even though the movie was a decent comedy, the discussion slipped into a somber analysis of the concept and inner workings of relationships. At that time, Kate was quite a bit more pessimistic than me. Stressful times, being a college student. But I still remember, clear as day, as she looked up at me and said ""It's sad when you think about it. Us, people, being so different from each-other, we are basically incompatible."" After I asked why is that, she said ""Because think about it: people are such evil creatures at their core. If relationships were such a natural thing, then why do you see so much abuse, so many broken marriages, so much suffering all around?"" I think I responded something among the lines of ""Because we are social creatures, and we need one another in the end.""

I kept thinking about that moment every now and then. I think about the certainty of human despise and the uncertainty on the world that reflected in her eyes at that time. And then I think about all the good times we had. I think about every joke that ever made her laugh. About all the places we've been to, and the curiosity and fascination she showed experiencing new cultures together. All the late-night talks about nothing and everything at the same time. All the times we cooked together, dancing to the music in the radio while flipping pans and mixing ingredients. All the times we hanged out with friends, and the knowing looks we gave each-other when we noticed something funny. All the silent moments, with her in my arms, slowly drifting to sleep. And I hope that I helped change her mind. I hope that I made her happy.

23:57 PM

Those damn pranksters came back again. They're knocking on the windows and the door. I think they recorded my voice the other night, they keep yelling in what sounds like my voice. Currently I locked myself in the bedroom, waiting to see if they go away.

23:57 PM

They keep at it. I'm gonna call the police.

23:57 PM

Fucking hell, the phone line must be messed up. Called a few times. The call went through only once, and I could barely distinguish what the dispatch guy was saying.

23:57 PM

This can't be happening!!! This can't be happening!!!

Relax, Dean, it will be fine. You have a gun, the door is locked and the police should be on their way. Any moment now.

23:57 PM

Shit, I think they broke in! I can hear footsteps in the house.

23:57 PM

What the fuck is going on? There is constant knocking on my door. It's too fast, I don't see how anyone could knock on a door that quick. After every burst of knocking, they are calling for me to come outside. It still sounds like my voice. Just what on Earth is happening?

23:57 PM

I can't do it anymore. They must have been going on for hours at this point. I hear rapid footsteps down the corridor, going to the bathroom. Then it comes back, just as fast, followed by bursts of knockings. After each knocking, the voice changes.

It drives me fucking nuts! How can it be?! At some point it sounded like Otis, but I know it can't be him. I would have heard his car come up the driveway, surely. Then it sounds like my mother, and doctor Rodriguez, and my friend Jeremy, and AND AND AND AND.

23:57 PM

I saw one out of the window. It got down on four legs and ran towards the house. It had a mocking imitation of clothing on, morphed to its skeletal body. It looked like a pitiful imitation of us. What the hell are these things? And why did it look like Otis?

23:57 PM

The knocking is getting so hard right now. I can hear them on the roof, trampling. They are trying to get in. They are trying to convince me to come outside. I don't think the cops are coming anymore. They are close to breaking the door down. They have Kate's voice.

Had some cereal this morning, about to head out to fix a leak in the roof, above the porch. It's been driving me crazy these past few nights.

19:03 PM

This day was productive, at least I'm happy about that. Still pretty boring out here. The snow completely covers the road up the holler. But at least the blizzard seems to be over. In a couple of days, I hope they can send the ploughs over here.

No updates, everything is fine at the cabin. Excited to go back into town!

15:89 AM

Must be really nice weather in New York now! I really miss Kate. Can't wait to see her again.

14:11 PM

I remember that time we used to go down to the creek. There was an old coal refinery down there. Remember when we would go down there? We were sitting on the edge of the water, skipping stones. You never were that skilled at it. But you liked seeing the miners work. Would you like to go there again?

00:13 PM

Hey! It's Dean McConnell again. Sorry about that.

Everything is fine now. It's a bit warm in the house, a bit concerned for the state of the wood. But at least I got the radio back on. So many new things there. Such educational material. And such interesting voices.



5.

Deputy Harlan Harris leaned back in the creaky desk chair. He looked visibly tired. He read and re-read Dean's notebook since arriving at the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Thompson was kind enough to provide him with a desk near the far end of the precinct, and Harris' back was hurting from sitting down so long. He got up and lit a cigarette, trying to piece together the information.

Dean sounded like he was in a lot of torment, and his handwriting slowly became more unclear as the pages progressed. He talked about someone harassing him, maybe pranking him, but the later entries point to something far more extreme. Dean thought he wasn't tormented by people by the end of it, he thought he was tormented by creatures. He also mentioned Otis Bailey, Sheriff Thompson's Deputy. He thought one of those creatures looked like Otis. Could it have been Otis? No one saw him since the ordeal, as far as the APB put out was concerned.

Harris thought Dean might have lost his mind halfway during his stay at the cabin, due to the loneliness and emotional turmoil he went through. But still, there must be a way to uncover the truth. He walked away from the desk, his boots hitting the marble floor. As he turned the corner, he saw a fleeting shape sliding into the Sheriff's office. Even though he only saw the person with the corner of his eye, Harris recognized the colors as that of Pineville S.D. A few moments later, as he was walking, he heard Sheriff Thompson's voice booming from his office.

1pbqgzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1pbqgzf/my_classmate_admitted_she_fantasized_about/,My classmate admitted she fantasized about assaulting me,"Hi, I(20F) never used Reddit before so excuse me if I end up not making any sense.

Recently my friend admitted she was having fantasies about assaulting me and I genuinely don't know what to do.

A little backstory. 
I unfortunately have the worst luck when it comes to partners and attracting weirdos. My first ever boyfriend beat me up once and I got assaulted multiple times by men in public, but this specific thing has been keeping me awake at night.

Theres this girl at my uni (we're the same year and both 20, we have all the same classes) and at first she was okay. Then the trauma dumping started. She showed all of us videos where she self harms, pics from the time when she was starving herself and just generally upsetting stuff that we didn't want to see.

I want to make it clear that I have nothing against sharing your trauma, but dumping all of that, videos and all, on people you met two weeks ago isn't okay.

Anyway, we went to a party together that the older students host for first years (there was about 10 of us) and everything was fine until it wasn't. 
She told me she was feeling sick and her boyfriend, yes boyfriend, was nowhere near so I took her to the bathroom. The moment we stepped in she jumped me, pushing me against the wall and trying to kiss me and just do stuff that I didn't consent to. Obviously I was stunned for a second but pushed her off of me right away. 

Then she tried to cling to me and was slurring about me not liking her and her just wanting a kiss. I just grabbed her hand and got her to her boyfriend and told him she needs to go home. 

I though that was it. Okay, she was drunk, I won't make a big deal out of it, she probably doesn't even remember she did that. 

But that part made me feel like I did something wrong. Like I was the one taking advantage of her because I wasn't as drunk.

Time skip, It's been a year and she apologised for it, in the meantime she started self harming again and guilt tripping me and separating me from the rest of our classmates.

I really did all I could to make my point clear, I don't want to be near you, but she wouldn't let it go.

So a few weeks ago she gives me a letter where she's explaining how my additude towards her shifted 180° and she was super hurt by it.

And I made the stupidest decision to agree to a coffee with her to finally tell her off.

Then she tells me everything. How she regrets that night, how she was only in love with me (while having a boyfriend). And the worst of all, how she still replays that night in her mind and wishes she waited for me to get more drunk so I wouldn't be able to push her off or, best case scenario, wouldn't remember anything.

You can imagine my reaction to that revelation. Obviously I was scared shitless, this girl just admitted to wanting to SA me, I don't feel safe around her.

She still follows me around and begs me to give her a chance and ""can things go back to the way they were?"".

I need help, I don't know what to do. I do not feel safe going to uni anymore, my other classmates help as much as they can at keeping her away but she uses the mental illness card as an out all the time.

I don't know if I should report her? Tell her boyfriend? 

I feel embarrassed telling my parents or talking to anyone else, this is my last resort.

The worst bit is, do I even call it sexual assault? 
Because if she did it once, what is stopping her from doing it again.",1,1764626903.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

1pbqewe,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1pbqewe/i_realized_i_never_wanted_kids_after_watching_my/,I realized I never wanted kids after watching my older sister lose every part of herself to motherhood,"This kinda hit me slowly over the last few years, not like one big moment but more like watching someone you love fade  out of their own life. My older sister used to be this hilarious chaotic person who traveled constantly, had random hobbies, made last minute plans, all that. She was the one who got me into  hiking and photography. Then she had her first kid and everyone kept saying it changes  you in a good way. I kept waiting for that part to show up. Instead I watched her shrink. Every week she looked more exhausted, more like she was performing a role instead of  living her life.   
When the second kid came around it got even worse. She stopped talking about anything that wasnt daycare or tantrums  or how her husband does not help. She used to send me stupid memes at night or drag me out for late coffee runs. Now she falls asleep mid sentence. She told me once that  she doesnt even remember the last time she read a book. Her entire personality just dissolved into keeping small humans alive and apologizing for being tired all the time. She loves  her kids, obviously, but I cant ignore how unhappy she looks when no one is watching. There  is this heaviness around her that never existed before.   
The part that really  stuck with me happened at a family dinner two months ago. Someone asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she literally said she just wanted one day where she could  think in full sentences again. It was said half joking but her eyes looked so empty that I had to look away. And then my mom laughed and said thats motherhood for you, like this is  some normal rite of passage. I remember thinking if this is the default expectation, then something is seriously messed up.   
I keep hearing  people say that having kids gives purpose, that it makes life fuller. Maybe thats true for some,  but watching my sister has shown me a version that is the opposite. A version where someone bright and funny gets slowly erased and no one around her even notices because they  are too busy celebrating the idea of motherhood itself. I dont want that. I dont want to lose myself, my time, my brain, my everything just to fit into some script that I never asked for.  And honestly I think deciding that is the most compassionate thing I can do for my future self . ",2,1764626770.0,childfree,0,1.0,False
1pbqeun,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1pbqeun/the_hollowoak_prophecy_blood_oranges_broken_faith/,"The Hollow-Oak Prophecy: Blood Oranges, Broken Faith, and a Creature of Ice (Light fantasy, 3857 words)","A leisurely first light crept up the hills. Rising blood oranges were bad omens, and the only roosters rallying its rise were his brothers-in-arms, their chorus sullen and quarrelsome. Twenty-two in counting gathered in the meeting hall, some fighting sleep with their heads on their knees, leaving just a handful to decide the fate of the Serpent’s Tail. Unlike a parliament, their reptilian band never held enfranchisement as an unwavering right. When faces failed to appear at the entrance or through the broken window behind the abandoned pub, Lord Hollow-Oak made careful note of their absence. Tough days were upon them. *Every face I meet looks at me with scowls.* The realization twisted the tension in his belly tighter. There were no laughs or smiles for their faithful lord. Their gazes were a hungry mob, his decapitated head carried on a stick in the whites of their eyes. Someone watching might mistake this for the opening move of a coup d'état. As the one-handed clock struck nine, the Serpents glanced at their stools, then at each other, trying to silently decide whether they’d sit with him or stand against him.

Waving away a dusty cobweb tangled beneath the wooden legs, Beolin the Red Dog sat down on his stool. The warm-blooded mutt of the Serpent’s Tail was rarely one to disappoint. He snarled and cursed often enough, his cheeks dusted with their own dark webs of reluctant facial fluff, but he was always loyal to the teeth. *If any still remain.* It was difficult to count the truth of that by smile alone.

A grisly mop of auburn clung to the left side of his face, covering faded wounds. “Get on with it then,” the Red Dog growled. Held back four years in higher education and expelled last summer, Beolin’s sole existence had been spent serving the Flints—later, now the Hollow-Oaks—as he personally squandered in the filth of his grandmother’s attic. “The fortune teller’s den,” that’s what Beolin referred to it as. Others called it a tragedy.

One by one, the rest fell into their stools. Dark mutters died down, cheeks dry and barren save for the occasional spit on the planks, the chatter fading as they strained to listen to their lord’s chosen summit. The Red Dog banged his foot against the floor until the stragglers heeded. *They’re lucky I am content with a little disobedience,* Hamish remarked sourly. Soon the snakes gave themselves a break from hissing their displeasure. “Good.” He never dared to meet their daggered frowns before the last of his words were spoken. “My thanks to those who decided to come. I understand many would rather be at bacon and eggs than chewing words with the likes of me. This wasn’t how I wanted to spend these hours at dawn either. I swear on that, at least…” *If I meet their eyes I will be eaten alive.* Hard glares were the least of Lord Hollow-Oak’s worries; it was the smiles that bothered him. Wet lips full of twisted mockery. “It has come to my attention, however, that our recent breakfasts and meals together have been rather unpleasant. This coffee we’ve been drinking has turned bitter. And I dare say no spoonfuls of honey or sugar could convince anyone here to willingly take another sip. But heed my advice, and you’ll all soon be merrily gulping down this new beverage I bring forth.”

The room mulled that over, though their expressions revealed his counsel tasted just as bitter as before. Dallos Miller licked his lips as if the words were salt. The lump in Big-Ear Wen’s olive-skinned throat rolled up and down, trying and failing to swallow, while Old Tyan made sounds like a vintage automobile sputtering to express the taste. Then Yuri the Runny Yolk spat yellowish ooze from the back of his throat. It missed his lordship’s trainer by an inch, landing on the rug beneath his feet instead. *A response only appropriate for an egg.* The Yolk’s rheumy eyes were stained a similar hue to the glob. From his splatter, it seemed the young man was as rotten on the inside as he appeared on the outside. “Shove that spoon up your arse, m’lord.” Though shorter than his years suggested, the noisy egg shared Hamish’s blondness, his sleek instead of curled, and dusted with pepper on top. “After I’ve heated the rim with a lighter, of course. Speaking for myself, I am sick of your honey and tea.”



*That wouldn’t be the first time you’ve done that with a spoon,* he almost answered. Instead, Lord Hollow-Oak kept quiet. *I shouldn’t provoke him more.* Suddenly plenty of others were willing to share their thoughts as well. Hamish answered, “Would you rather I make an omelette, or is that also too strong for the likes of you to stomach?”

Yuri sunk his teeth into that. “Smells to me like the same poison either way, m’lord.”

For once, Tom-Tickle-Me-Silly hadn’t the slightest jest on his lips. “Come on, now, boys. There are more important matters to discuss.” Thankfully, the fool’s words came without spittle. Fourth in command, last to be chosen, Tom’s jests had grown as cynical as they were once amusing. A chain of keys jingled in place of bells by his loose bottom pockets, one leg purple, the other green, his upper garments matching. “There’s no time for quips. We must act before our enemies decide they’ve grown tired of our games.” His face had long ago been painted split for every excuse of an occasion, though Hamish never once recalled seeing the fool wear a motley three-pointed cap ’n bells.

“Indeed there’s not,” said the egg. The rheumy lad turned to face the pit of Serpents that suddenly thought it best to listen rather than bite and curse over each other for a change.

*Perhaps they’re too tired to protest,* Hollow-Oak realized as he eyed them. *Most of them have already given up, it seems.* On the other hand, Yuri did not hesitate to speak his mind. “No point in meetings, nor discussions or plans, or drinking from another of our lord’s poisoned cups. Am I the only serpent here who smells it? This all reeks of poison. There’s no fucking time for the the Serpent’s Tail’ existence, and that’s coming from an egg!” Again Yuri spat. This time he succeeded in wetting a shoelace, his own.

A chant erupted from those who saw wisdom in such words. Some remained silent. Others nodded in approval. Lord Hollow-Oak’s own words felt like large cubes of ham lodged in his throat. *Why waste breath on these snakes,* he wondered stiffly, but he knew he had to try. Before he could speak though, a jingle chimed gently in the commotion. The jester stood, banging a motley glove on the pool table the majority gathered around until every mouth closed shut.

“Oh, oh, oh, I see… You’d like for us all to slither back into our nests, is that it?” mocked Tom. “Surely that will stop the Skinner Brothers from clubbing us to death. Go ahead, show them the softness of your bellies. They might even mistake you for worms!” When Hamish believed for a second there was a voice of reason, Tom-Tickle-Me-Silly grimaced. To everyone’s surprise, the motley fool leapt onto the table. “What we need isn’t to hide and disband. We joined this brotherhood because the problems we face now were hurting us long before. The answer will never be in hiding. What we need, no, what we should all demand… is a leader who keeps his promises of glory, a Hollow-Oak without a hollow spine. Do I recall correctly there being a younger brother? An acorn from a sturdier branch of the tree?”

Hamish felt his stomach dropping to his bowels. “You are more the fool than you dress, Tom. My infant brother is no more fit as a leader than he is my blood. This talk is ridiculous.”

The jester kicked a red cue ball down a pocket of the pool table. “It is not as ridiculous as you, Lord Hollow-Oak of hollow words.” He punted another. It missed, hitting the edge. “Other Serpents whisper that their master has served his term long past its due. Let the younger Oak prove his worth. I hear he’s as hard as flint.”

*And breaks as easily,* Hamish was keen to mention.

Catching a yellow cue ball before the jester kicked another in, Yuri crooked his head in amusement, fondling it in his palm. “I suppose your second choice of command would be yourself? Lord Fool does have a nice ring to it. Though I do fear others might think we are all the greater fools for dooming ourselves. Would you have us juggling fruit or merely balancing spinning plates on a stick as you relax gorging yourself on pears? Such a fine leader you’d make.”

That put a smile on Tom’s lips. “Why not? My first decree would be to crack a few rotten eggs.” With that performance complete, the jester hopped back off the pool table. The room filled with sighs. Hamish didn’t want to know how many were of relief or disappointment that it was over.

Everyone was equally mistaken. Somehow a blade appeared in Tom-Tickle-Me-Silly’s motley hands, dancing from purple to green. The fool lunged forward.

Stuck in his seat, Yuri screamed helplessly, thrashing his hands like a toad stuck in a boiling pot, but that did nothing to stop the mottled slashes raining down.

His Red Dog went forward, catching the traitor by the wrist before anyone else could flinch. “ENOUGH,” barked Beolin. Ruthlessly, he twisted until the blade clattered onto the planks. In an instant the harm was done. 

A chunk of an ear stained the billiard cloth. Blood, puss, and wax fled out of its empty canal resembling the waters rushing out of the pub taps. Only Tom looked at his work with dullness; the remaining were of shock and horror.  *If that fool dares toss the flesh in a table pocket I’ll have no choice but to cut off the hand,* Hamish frowned. Thankfully the fool did not take the bait. “Someone clean this up before it stains.” It was Gael who plucked the chunk in cloth, uselessly dunking it in a glass rattling with ice. More a maid than butcher, the grunt leaned over and patted the thick, dark droplets.

Breathing heavily as if it were him being dunked in the ice, Yuri excused himself with a sullen mutter. His neck and shirt were stained with the leakage, a slushy mix of sewer muck. Dark mutters and curses soon drifted like smoke throughout the hall.

The Red Dog inspected the steel before handing it to him. It was a perfect, wretched piece of metal, its handle split in orange and blue. *Too perfect.* A laughing jester mask was carved onto the pommel, gaping half-moons mouth and eyes. Otherwise the one in flesh kept silent. When Lord Hollow-Oak had seen enough, he waved it away.

Pocketing it out of sight, Beolin frowned grimly. “There’s no need for this… this… *stupidity*. We have plenty in this village. For the sake of yourselves, listen to what Ham—”

“That is enough.” Lord Hollow-Oak raised a hand to silence the mutt. *I have to act now. Or else I have already failed.* When the room showed no sign of listening, he had no choice but to pull Tom's arm forward and split a cue ball on a knuckle. Snapping bone was sure to silence a crowd. The Serpent’s fourth in command let out a horrendous hiss, attempting to uncrook the finger in vain. Hamish did not bother to inspect it. “I have stomached enough treason. I granted everyone the right to complain, not to threaten my own kin with your barbed tongues, nor to endanger my brothers-in-arms. I have grown tired of your *jokes*.” He turned to Ve and Venison, both of them giant sacks of muscle and meat. He hoped they would make for obedient guards. “Remove Tom-Tickle-Me-Wretched from my sight. I do not wish to lay eyes on him.”

The meat bags motioned forward. “Let’s do this quietly,” said Venison.

Soon the jester began to sob. “Oh, oh no, no no. I- I didn’t mean to, I—” the fool pleaded to blind ears. “Please Hamish, Beolin, friends— I beg you. Not this. Anything but *thissss*. Yuri, Yuri! I am so sorry I— *Oh gods.* I will, I’ll never—!” *Crocodile tears?* If someone held a knife to his throat and wanted an answer, Hamish could not reply.

Gael frowned, taking hold of a purple arm. “I know, I know. Don’t worry, pal. Oh now, now, let’s not do that here. Come out quietly… It is going to be fine. Everything’s going to be fine.”

*I'll surely have many cursing my name after this.* Hamish searched the room wondering how the snakes would react. Wen might squeal, but only to a few, his mother included. Miller and his brother, Pat, were cracking smiles at the fool's misery, with the youngest Miller urging to break another finger himself. Yet in all the Serpents' eyes, there was fear.

With less reluctance, Venison grabbed a green arm. They were near their way escorting him when—

“I say let him stay,” demanded an echo from the back of the room. A rush of anger crept up Lord Hollow-Oak’s neck as he glared toward whoever disobeyed him now. But when the voice came into view, clutching a blooded rag in a red-gloved hand, it was Yuri-the-Runny-Yolk, pulling out another stool beside the pool table. “Me and the fool have much and more to discuss.”

The meat sacks exchanged him a bewildered look. “Well then?” said Hamish, breaking the silence. “Get your bloody hands off the fourth in command.” The fool motioned away, clutching his broken hand and sitting back in his stool, all the quieter. 

“Shall we begin?” asked Hamish.

Lord Hollow-Oak stepped outside to relieve himself of the ancient beverage found beneath the pub’s cellars. The building belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Brown, or at least it had. From what he’d heard from his father in passing, the hairy-knuckled man had looked utterly despairing when recounting the closure. The Browns’ nasty divorce had shuttered the place entirely. No children, nephews, or nieces to inherit the local favorite tavern. Now it sat forever empty on the shores of the River Shin, apart from a few scattered meetings.

The wind blew cold kisses across his skin. His gaze drifted to the rising smoke from a campfire on the far side of the water, hidden among trees and smog. Further still stretched a long ridge of land, shaped almost like the shank of a leg. That marked the start of *Fairy Hill.* Unlike the other surrounding slopes, that mystical place was where the first settlers had begun. *The first Shins of Shin.* Sometimes he’d think he was seeing hoards of savages descending from the hills, riding on the backs of wild boars and deer to reclaim their captured land. It felt strange looking at the barren terrain, nothing but a lone sprouting tree jutting from the ruins of rocky debris.

Hamish had barely stepped back into the room before the argument erupted. The Serpents claimed they wanted to discuss “strategy,” though from what Hamish could tell, they mostly wanted to discuss how loudly they could insult one another. He remained outside. *Let them talk freely first.*

Another Serpent had pushed his way in: Fallon Drizzle-Mouth, known for his oversized tongue. “Lord Commander Hollow-woke, I think you meant. Yethh, the one who’th gotten uth all into thith methh.” *Oh bloody biscuits.* Hamish strained to listen, but the gist of it was there.

Their newest member looked more like a wood mouse than a reptile. Beady eyes sat above the thin whiskers of a mustache.  “Eh. Whatever he said!” nattered Wen, his prominent ears sprouting with thistles. “M’lord has gotten us into all this trouble, indeed: the Skinner Brothers; the Cowardly Kraken and her tentacles, oh, and also has given me more cuts and bruises than I ever had before I ever decided to join. Hamish should answer for all of it, aye. That seems fair.’

Old Tyran cleared his throat with the heaviness of a man thrice his age, adjusting his robes in never comfortable in his stool. “And how do you suppose he does that? Gifting the Skinners and the Sea-Wentch each ball in a cardboard box?” Early in his years, their elder was only twelve-and-a-half but wise as a wizard. 

Dallos Miller puffed out his chest as though the room had gathered to listen to his brilliance, leaning forward with the smugness of a giant. “We’d only need a box of cards to squeeze them in,” he boldly declared in front of everyone. “Our lord Hollow-Oak has bravely proven his balls are molded from iron: a pair of bolts and a dangling little screw spotted in rust.

“That's enough talk from you*.”* Hamish strutted in, chewing down his rage. *I should keep a few cue balls in my pocket to silence these blabbering mouths with broken thumbs,* contemplated Lord Hollow-Oak, *either that, or let them mistake them for my own.* “Speak some sense or I will call an end to this meeting.”

The yolk in the whites of Yuri’s eyes sneered. “Call an end to it all."" 

“Wheres the spirit in that?” asked Hamish. 

“Dead,” answered the egg far too quickly. “Along with us soon.”

Other questions were posed, ones that didn’t threaten to castrate their faithful lord. Surprisingly, the Red Dog raised a few himself. It wasn’t often that mutts complained. “Aye, we got spirit in this dusty room, that’s for certain. I hear it now: sounds like a room full of soldiers in the barracks before being marched out to get shot to death. We’re tired of smelling blood, spilling blood, and licking old wounds that open every time we try to wrap them up.” He raised a greasy mop of hair from his eye. Circular, red imprints of ring-like scars ran from cheek to ear, a hundred hickeys from the Kraken’s tortuous tools. Beolin likened them to *sweet kisses*. He let the hair fall back, hiding his grotesqueness. “Though spirit alone won’t win the logistics of this war. We have no trade, fewer soldiers year by year, and customers are too frightened, too clever, to risk buying our product. The Skinner Brothers hold the poorest council estates. Poor, but the best for selling, as we well know. How do you suggest we cross the waters to sell when the Kraken holds the bridge?” His dog turned to him, searching despairingly for an answer. 

Hamish raised an arm. He stood from his stool and pointed out the broken window. Its wooden edges framed Fairy Hill with its lonely sapling and the river rushing below. Everything remained as it always had been. 

“We fly.” Curling their lips, the Serpents stayed still, watching their lord’s folly. He waited as they held their tongues, contemplating his words, trying to answer a riddle that wasn’t there. *Now.* Hamish kept his arm outstretched. *Fly, fly to me.* Nothing came through the window, even as he gave the sign. A motionless sky without a cloud or a glimmer of white. In the corner of his eye, he could see Tom’s mockery spreading thinly on his lips, the Egg’s gut churning with disgust, and the Red Dog’s silent disappointment, all tired of his hollow promises. *You must. You must come before I am eaten alive.* The empty window frame continued to frame the hills, river, and distant sight as it always had, not a sliver of white. Then Hamish heard glass shatter from behind.

A feathery blizzard came spiraling inward. Shards of reflective glass scattered over the planks and pool table, cutting those standing close to the broken window. Those who no longer covered their faces stared up in astonishment at the snowy owl circling above. The pub had always had an airy chill, but whatever Valec brought in was colder. For once, the snakes did not hiss or spit, they gaped. The owl’s talons swooped down, knocked over the ice-filled glass, and snatched the chunk of ear floating inside. The Egg screamed, “MY EAR, MY EAR, IT TOOK MY EAR!” but nobody cared to listen. Valec continued to circle them, as if they were his prey. Hamish raised his arm out. The owl had no intention of landing. It preferred to spiral, swooping down at heads and scraping them with black talons. “To me!” demanded Hamish. Again he shot out his arm for the owl to land. It didn’t. *You came out the wrong window, you foolish bird. Can you not fathom glass?* Somehow the owl blamed him for that. Valec landed on a pendant light, eyeing him with squinting golden pearls. One of the Serpents attempted to whack the winged creature with a broom. That only crazed the owl more. Hamish mouthed, *To me or I’ll break your wings.* Instead of his outstretched arm, the owl landed on his head and finally rested. His own white curls blended into the feathers, like a winter nest.

“That bird *belongs* to you?” Dallos Miller asked, aghast.

Yuri was less impressed. “That bastard stole my ear!”

“Such a clever one too,” Tyan remarked, stroking his chin. “And by no means just any bird. By the looks of it, that’s a Snowy Owl, a *Bubo scaniacus*, a rare visitor from the Arctic regions, not a native Scottish bird at all. They occasionally appear in Scotland during the colder seasons or when food is scarce in their winter lands. Very intelligent creatures. This one may have migrated from as close as the Shetland Islands.”

Wen wiggled his ears in excitement. “Is this how we’ll fly, m’lord? Your winter beast will deliver our product from above?” His ears slowed as his voice faded. “That won’t stop Dale and Rass Skinner from skinning us, though.”

Lord Hollow-Oak strained his neck in disgust as his bird devoured human flesh above his head. It stayed still well enough, but its sharp claws were like razors, and it weighed much heavier than any bird should. “Not quite,” Hamish said, plopping the creature down onto a separate stool. “Venison, Gael, close all the curtains and blinds in this room.

 After the guards had hastily pulled them shut, the Serpents stared at the creature in wonder. He could not blame them. Valec, despite his willful nature, was a spectacle in this part of the world. Hardly tamed, hardly pleasant, the *Bubo* glared through its slits at everyone present, especially at him.

“Shed your feathers, Valec.” Hearing this, the owl twisted its head right around and squinted its pearls tighter in what seemed to be annoyance. Hollow-Oak held out a dead mouse from his pocket and fed it to him. “*NOW,”* Hamish demanded.

I'm a bit reserved, but I'm definitely open to meeting new people so I'm surprised I'm in this situation to begin with. Somehow I've reached quarter two without really “befriending” anyone. I also had pretty bad luck with my OWee and mentorate groups... I've made friends at times but the groups I belonged to in the first couple of weeks drifted apart and I didn't manage to include myself anywhere else. It's been especially hard without having anyone to talk to or study with, and I feel too shy to suddenly approach someone at a lecture or anything like that. I'm trying to improve on that aspect, but I'm still not sure what I should do or where I could go, if anywhere, to meet new people in a hopefully easier way.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

When I questioned them further, they state it's because it's how their accounting department generates invoices, and it's how all of their transactions are logged when they are not an in-store purchase, and the experiences they offer are not considered an in store purchase.

It all seems very legitimate, I just feel a little wary sending them this form for something like this, when it contains seemingly more personal information than necessary? My work is not in the business world at all so I realize I could be totally off-base in this thinking.

I like most of the coffee that I brew at home… until I watch any gear video or scroll through here lol! My set up isn’t great and I know that, but I am curious what should be my next step.

For reference, I would call myself a moderate to advanced beginner in this space - I’ve brewed hundreds of cups (some good some bad!) and even found some solid recipes for my V60, usually sticking to Lance’s 2 pour set up but aiming for a little more body than tea-like. My ideal brew has good flavour separation but more emphasis on juicy sweetness.

Now to the “problems”

I have an Opus grinder, the Hario filters and I just run tap water (I don’t know whether or not it’s ‘good’ tap water). Now I know right away that the filters and water could make a huge jump, but I’m also considering getting an ode 2 for some more advanced flavours and clarity. 

First off, am I going to regret getting the Ode vs something like the k-ultra or what else might fit a more well rounded profile?

And second, would I notice a bigger difference getting better filters (Cafec t90?) and water? Should I fix those first before getting a better grinder?

I have so many questions haha! Anything helps!",1,1764626173.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I havent played it yet, im literally in the first room checking out what the hell all these settings are. So far ive changed, with help from youtube, field of vision and something called Nix prompt. Switched to performance mode. Oh and obviously motion blur and all that nonsense.

It looks like youtube tips and tricks videos might be a little outdated. I usually just go in pretty much blind, but since the game is massive and had some harsh critiques I thought I'd ask. I'll probably still check out the youtube tips, but best tips are given by the community.

a lot of posts are asking for Pulseway alternative, but most of them need it for Patching and RMM. I have Pulseway from their very beginning, when they were MMSoft and way before they were bought by Kaseya. The most useful things with pulseway mobile app for Android are, in order of use frequency:

1. **Killing or logging off user's RDP session** from Terminal Server! That's key functionality. Customer calls, I cannot use remote app...15 seconds later, even while I am drinking coffee, problem solved.
2. **Rebooting/Shutting down/up VM**s on VMWare or Hyper-V host. I am monitoring dozens of customer's hosts and it is real life saver having an option to quickly reboot, shut down/up VM remotely from my pocket.
3. **Unlocking or resetting user's password** in local AD domain.
4. **Starting or restarting a service** instantly, especially from a reduced set of predefined services on go, that's crazy useful!

So, I don't nag about Pulseway price, would pay even more, but it has become useless in past few months. 8 times out of 10 when I need it on mobile it get's caught in logging in loop. Been online with support, resolved, but issue comes back after a week or two. Also those notifications cannot be turned off anymore, went crazy lately, I receive 1000+ audible notifications per day and cannot turn them off.

So I am **looking for alternative, 99% use on Android mobile**.   
[Level.io](http://Level.io), Action1, Altera, TacticalRMM, msp360, even ninjaRMM....tested all these and more, but none of those are handy in exactly listed and most needed categories on MOBILE.

1pbq3ua,https://i.redd.it/mmgl3by9yn4g1.gif,"After 2 years of passionate work from just 2 devs (+ vast seas of coffee), our turn-based card-fighter roguelite has finally gone into Early Access!","Today’s that dreaded launch day for us. We finally got [Sheva](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337620/Sheva/) into early access! We couldn’t be more excited or more terrified, depending on how you look at it.

We’re just a small 2-man team and this game has been our passion project for quite some time. The idea started with a simple question: what if a traditional fighting game was turn-based + a roguelite? **From that, we crafted a card-fighter built around simultaneous turns and attack-card chaining**.

# What’s the gist of the gameplay?

All battles are 1 versus 1 and in each one, you and your opponent act at the same time. You either:

* Charge (draw a card)
* Block (which blocks 2 attacks)
* Attack (spending up all your cards in the sequence you arranged them in)

You can see each other’s hands at all times, so the idea is to reasonably infer (based on the number of cards they have, for example) whether they’ll attack you, draw more, or try defending the next turn if they think you might go on the offensive.

Progression that changes every run and after each run you **unlock from 7 different chakras**, each of which **determines the theme of the next run**, but also **determines unique opponent behavior types in battle**, and **each carries its own reward** if you beat them.

The order you pick them reshapes each run, so every attempt evolves differently and always ends in a climactic boss battle.

Every design decision, from the simultaneous turn system to the structure of a run, is built to support strategy, adaptability, and a sense of personal growth at the heart of the game.

# Thank you everyone!

… for reading this and checking out Sheva, and in general for supporting smaller roguelite devs who are trying their best to create unique experiences in this ever larger and broader genre. 

**Additionally, to make it as affordable as possible to as many roguelite enjoyers as possible, the game is just $5 now on Steam.**

Stay cool... or warm, it is December after all, and hoping we’ll get some feedback to see if we hit it right with this. And I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you may have!",2,1764626073.0,roguelites,0,1.0,False

The sky over Coney Island glowed orange as the sun dipped behind the skyline. The boardwalk was still buzzing from CJ’s announcement, but far above all that noise—on the roof of a dark, unfamiliar skyscraper in Manhattan—the tone was very different.

A black helicopter idled on the rooftop pad, its blades slowly spinning. Wind howled between glass towers as two figures stood in the shadows near the edge.

One was clearly Giovanni—sharp suit, red tie, arms folded, expression carved from stone.

The other figure stood behind a veil of darkness, their face completely obscured. Only the faint glow of a lit cigar could be seen when they spoke.

⸻

🕶️ Scene 1 — “It’s All About the Property Tax”

Giovanni:
“Coney Island will return back to you.
You have my word.”

The mystery figure took a slow drag from their cigar.

???:
“It’s not about your word, Giovanni.
It’s about numbers.”

Giovanni’s eyes narrowed.

Giovanni:
“You sent me there to secure the island.
My men failed. The boy and his allies pushed us back.
But we still have leverage. We can stage another attack.”

The figure chuckled softly.

???:
“You still don’t get it.
It’s never about the first attack.
It’s about who owns what when the dust settles.”

Giovanni frowned.

Giovanni:
“We had active control.”

The figure shook their head.

???:
“Control is temporary.
Ownership is permanent.”

They exhaled smoke and turned toward the city lights.

???:
“Coney Island will return back to me, Giovanni.
Because in the end…”

They grinned in the shadows.

???:
“It’s all about the property tax.”

Giovanni didn’t react outwardly, but his jaw clenched.

Giovanni:
“You’re worried about property tax… after we deployed an army?”

???:
“Property tax. Zoning. Land value. Development contracts.
You see ‘a battlefield.’
I see ‘a future luxury district.’
Your job is to destabilize.
My job is to acquire.”

Giovanni glanced out at the direction of Brooklyn.

Giovanni:
“The boy announced a subway project.
He plans to bring the League back officially.
That will spike values… and complicate control.”

The figure smiled.

???:
“And that’s why Coney Island will return to me.
When he finishes building it up—
when the new gyms open—
when tourists flood back…”

A beat.

???:
“I buy it.
Piece by piece.
Lot by lot.
Half the time, people don’t even read what they sign.”

Giovanni’s eyes thinned.

Giovanni:
“And where does Team Rocket fit into this?”

The figure flicked ash off the edge of the roof.

???:
“Simple.
You keep him busy.
You scare investors.
You create just enough chaos to make selling look ‘safe.’”

They laughed quietly.

???:
“While you throw Pokémon at him…
I throw contracts.”

Giovanni smirked despite himself.

Giovanni:
“Just remember…
without my forces, you have no pressure.”

???:
“And without my money, you have no forces.”

The wind howled between them.

They were partners—but barely.

Opposite ends of the same ugly equation.

The figure took one last drag and ground the cigar out on the steel railing.

???:
“Relax, Giovanni.
We’ll get Coney Island…
One way or another.”

Giovanni turned toward the helicopter.

Giovanni:
“Then I’ll make sure the boy doesn’t rebuild in peace.”

He stepped into the chopper.

As it lifted into the air, the shadowed figure watched the blades turn and murmured:

???:
“Build your gyms, little Champion…
I’ll be waiting at the closing table.”

The camera metaphorically pulls away from the skyscraper—

—and cuts back to Coney Island.

🧱 Scene 2 — Rebuilding the Lab

The sound of construction filled the air.

Power drills.
Metal beams clanking.
Workers shouting instructions over the roar of machinery.

In the center of it all, surrounded by scaffolding and support frames, stood Professor Willow’s new lab, halfway built.

A sleek glass façade faced the boardwalk, with reinforced lab sections toward the back. The foundation was being poured deeper, anchored to withstand whatever Team Rocket—or nature—threw at it.

Willow stood in a hard hat and borrowed reflective vest, clipboard in hand, looking both wildly out of place and exactly where he belonged.

Beside him, also in a hard hat—slightly crooked—was Matt.

No mask.
No cloak.
Just Matt.

They watched a steel beam being hoisted into place.

Matt:
“Pretty sure those guys don’t need your notes on structural integrity, professor.”

Willow huffed.

Willow:
“I was simply suggesting that the east wall would benefit from a second layer of reinforcement in case of… oh, I don’t know… another Rocket explosion?”

Matt snorted.

Matt:
“…Okay, yeah. Fair.”

They shared a small laugh.

It was awkward at first.
But the more they talked, the easier it became.

⸻

🧪 Inside the New Lab (Blueprints and Jokes)

They stepped into what would soon be the main research wing.

Right now it was just a concrete floor and metal skeleton, but Willow’s vision filled the space.

He pointed, his hands moving fast.

Willow:
“Over there—storage for Poké Balls and research journals.
Here, temperature-controlled habitat chambers.
There—a dual-type energy testing rig.
And here… the heart of the lab. The main console.”

Matt walked ahead, trying to imagine it with walls and equipment.

Matt:
“Where’s my part?”

Willow smiled.

Willow:
“Your annex will connect off this hall.”

He led Matt to another section—slightly smaller, but with its own wing.

Willow:
“Dedicated primarily to tactical field research, defense studies, and… well…”

He glanced carefully at his son.

Willow:
“You know more about Team Rocket strategies than anyone.
You know how they fight.
How they infiltrate.
How they adapt.”

Matt’s face softened.

Matt:
“So… you’re building me a counter-Rocket lab?”

Willow nodded.

Willow:
“If you’re willing.”

Matt looked around the space, took a breath, then gave a small, honest smile.

Matt:
“Yeah.
I’m willing.”

A nearby worker shouted:

Worker:
“Professor!
We’re about to pour the main foundation.
This would be a good time to mark any… permanent placements.”

Willow blinked.

Willow:
“Permanent…?”

Matt gestured at the ground.

Matt:
“I think he means… if you want anything buried under the lab.
Time capsules.
Old equipment.
Family secrets.”

Willow chuckled softly.

Willow:
“Well… I don’t have many family secrets I’d like buried.”

Then he paused.

He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small, charred metal plaque—warped at the edges, but still readable:

“Willow Research Lab — Coney Island”

The original sign from the first lab.

Matt stared at it.

His eyes flickered with so many emotions at once—loss, anger, nostalgia, regret.

Willow:
“This was all I could salvage the day I closed the old lab.”

He knelt and set it into the foundation frame.

Willow:
“If we’re starting over…
it should start with what survived.”

Matt swallowed.

He looked down at the plaque.
Then, carefully, he reached into his own pocket and pulled something out as well:

A tiny, singed Team Rocket insignia badge—broken, scratched, burnt.

He hesitated.

Matt:
“I kept this as a reminder of what they made me.
What they told me I was.”

Willow looked up at him.

Willow:
“You don’t owe them anything anymore.”

Matt nodded.

Matt:
“I know.”

He dropped the cracked Rocket emblem beside the lab plaque.

Matt:
“Let this be the last time it’s part of our story.”

Willow’s throat tightened.

Willow:
“Agreed.”

The workers began to pour the concrete slowly, encasing both metal pieces in the foundation.

Father and son watched as the past was sealed beneath the floor.

⸻

💬 Laughter and Healing

Later, sitting on a couple of overturned crates near the construction site, Willow and Matt shared coffee from a thermos while watching the crew work.

A Skwovet from Caleigh’s group ran by with someone’s dropped donut.
They watched it, amused.

Matt:
“That thing’s gonna evolve just from carbs.”

Willow chuckled.

Willow:
“At least it’s getting good use out of them.”

They fell into a comfortable silence.

For the first time in years, they weren’t shouting.
They weren’t separated by rubble, smoke, or lies.

They were just… sitting.

Willow sighed lightly.

Willow:
“I spent years looking for you, you know.”

Matt stared at the ground.

Matt:
“I know.
Mew showed me.”

Willow adjusted his glasses.

Willow:
“If you ever want to… talk about what they did.
Or how they trained you.
Or how to undo it. I’m here.”

Matt took a breath.

Matt:
“I don’t know how to be anything but what they made me.”

Willow shook his head.

Willow:
“That’s not true.
You were someone before them.
And you are someone after them.”

Matt glanced at him, both unsure and hopeful.

Matt:
“Yeah?
Who am I now?”

Willow smiled.

Willow:
“You’re my son.
We’ll figure out the rest together.”

Matt let out a short, slightly shaky laugh.

Matt:
“You always were corny.”

Willow:
“Occupational hazard of being a professor.”

They both laughed for real that time.

Above them, a Gyarados swam lazily along the shore.
Charmeleon chased a hammer-wielding Machop carrying supplies.
Workers argued about whose lunch a stray Pidgey stole.

It wasn’t perfect.

But it was a start.

⸻

As the chapter closes, the camera metaphorically pulls back:
	•	From the concrete sealing the old lab plaque and broken Rocket badge
	•	From Willow and Matt sitting and laughing together
	•	From the construction site slowly turning into a new lab
	•	To the skyline of Coney Island, full of cranes, repairs, and rebuilding

Far away, in Manhattan, Giovanni steps back into an elevator beside the shadowy figure.

Two different kinds of rebuilding.
Two different visions of Coney Island’s future.

One of healing.

One of control.

And both are coming.

# Hotel and setup notes:

The Paris hotel in Las Vegas. Just like all hotels on the Vegas strip, basic things like a bottle of water are more expensive than most people are used to but it is a great venue, with amble dining options, just a 15 minute drive from the airport.

The exhibit hall was a good size, as were the speaking room and the casino is pretty decent (as was the room rate). One of my favorite conference hotels this year.",1,1764625738.0,EduSalesUSA,0,1.0,False

After reading Sputnik Sweetheart a few times, I knew I read something similar somewhere in one of Murakami's short stories. Sure enough it was Man-Eating Cats. This might be my favorite story from this collection. And after rereading it, I like to think it is some sort of parallel world to Sputnik Sweetheart(I am a huge supporter of the Murakami Many-Worlds Theory). Like the ""Other side"" that shocked Miu, that transported Sumire and that K tried to get to. The story also has some seasonings of South of the Border West of the Sun, Killing Commendatore, Wind up Bird chronicles, Dance Dance Dance, and The City & Its Uncertain Walls.

_From tourist shop hack to cueva contact_  

The problem is, if I want to transact freely here, without putting my trust into a random Web3 app created by strangers who need my KYC but don't need or want to share anything about themself, then I need cash.  

I find a touristy gift shop with stickers on their window showing dollar signs and pesos. Inside is a young man with a trendy haircut and flashy clothes. He looks hip. Maybe he'll be into the future of finance?  

He confirms that he's happy to exchange money for me but looks befuddled when I mention USDT, the stablecoin pegged to the US dollar most commonly used in Argentina.  

""¿USD?""  

""No. USD**T**,"" I insist. I have no idea how to say stablecoins. ""Digital dolares?""  

He corrects me, _Dolares digitales_, but it still sounds like there's a question mark at the end of that.  

""Sí!""  

He looks at me again. ""¿Y quieres cambiarlos?"" ___And you want to exchange them?___  

I can't tell if he's confused by the concept or just thinks I don't look like the type to come walking into his shop talking about crypto.  

""Sí,"" I say again.  

He's still not sure. ""¿Dolares virtuales?""  

I blink. Virtual dollars sound like something you'd need for World of Warcraft. But maybe it's the better way to say it?  

""Sí,"" I say again. I am aware that I'm really not keeping up my side of this conversation.  

He thinks for a moment. ""Tell you what,"" he says in Spanish. ""What I can do is charge your card, hand you cash, you pay a little extra.""  

My first thought: _isn't that illegal?_ But of course, so is all of this, trying to buy dollars without going through the official systems.  

""How much is a little extra?"" He gives me a rate that is slightly cheaper than Western Union and we are in agreement.  

I tap my phone, he hands me cash. It feels slick, outside of the system, a benefit to both of us. I feel he understood my intent, even though he couldn't actually do the task.  

It's a cryptocard with USDT on it. Technically, I have just successfully exchanged stablecoins for cash.  Deep down, though, I know it doesn't count.  

My phone pings: Pomelo has added me to Telegram.  I immediately message back with a recap of how I am, because I'm used to my friendship circle who have the memory span of a fruit fly. I am pretty sure I'm not imagining his exasperated tone when he replies to say _Yes, I know and I'm working on it_.  

It's fine, I say breezily, I have weeks. No worries. What I really want is for him to say _Here's an address. Go there now. Don't look back_. before I lose my nerve.  

Argentina has had strict foreign exchange controls since late 2011 in an attempt to stop  capital flight. By 2012, the government flat out banned buying dollars for savings. Restrictions escalated, with online shopping restricted to two parcels a year, $25 max. In 2014, the country defaulted on its debt again.The gap between the official rate and the blue rate was 90%, opening the door for the cuevas offering illicit money exchange. The stage was set for any viable alternative that could avoid government restrictions. Enter stablecoins: digital, virtual, and available to hold without having to trust the bank.  

In Argentina, and globally, if you're paying attention, trust in banks is gone. People don't hold stablecoins as a symbol of rebellion; it's a working alternate system. It might not be ideal, but it is usable.  

Pomelo sends me regular reassuring messages  and I'm starting  to feel like his aging aunt who needs handholding because otherwise she'll start on the gin and then all hell will break loose. That said, maybe gin isn't a bad idea.  

Finally, _finally_, a whole three hours later, he sends me a name. A contact who will sell me pesos at the blue rate. He says that his friend is expecting my message.  

I spend the rest of the evening staring at my phone like it might bite me. Finally, out of pure fear that I'll be one of those people who go to Argentina and write a memoir about _almost_ using crypto, I pick up the phone.  

I message the Blue Man half in Spanish and half in English, not sure which language he will prefer.  

I'm searching for the perfect replacement for my pink keyboard when I receive  a message from Blue Man in perfect English, confirming that Pomelo told him that I'm wanting to buy pesos, and how much?  

Suddenly, this isn't a thought experiment anymore. Someone on the other end of a screen is offering to hand me cash, in a city I barely know, in exchange for something that we can't touch.  

He sends me a link, today's rate. Tells me USDT only. I ask which chain. There's a pause.  

It sounds like a small thing, but it's not. I want this trade to happen in the context of Ethereum. Tether—USDT—is on nearly every chain now but in Argentina it's commonly used on TRON. Cheap fees, fast transfers, but the ecosystem around it feels like a second-hand suit: functional but a little grimy. I've already decided  that if he won't do ERC-20 stablecoin transfer, I'm out.  

To my relief, Blue Man sends a screenshot from his wallet. Yes, TRON and SOL are at the top but also ERC-20 options: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Polygon. I stand in the street, phone in hand, trying to get USDT on Arbitrum and then I think, to hell with it. I already have $300 USDT sitting on mainnet, easier just to swap another $100 and eat the gas fees rather than keep chasing some hyperoptimized elegant solution that no one else cares about.  

Now that we are in technical agreement, Blue Man asks where I am so that he can bring me the cash. I tell him I'm wandering  lost trying to find a shop that will sell me a USB keyboard that I don't hate with the passion of a thousand suns, but once I've done  that, I'll meet him anywhere. Bonus points if there's coffee.  

I'm still staring at my phone when I bump into someone. The sidewalk is jammed with people, locals queuing up at a nondescript red doorway. No name, no music, just the smell of hot oil and a chalkboard with today's specials.  

I join them.  

When it's my turn to walk inside, I find I'm in a tiny room with chairs up against a thin table on one side and a counter on the other   where multiple people are dishing out meals. Tucked in by the doorway is a creased-face old man running the till with practiced precision: cash, card, QR.  

I ask for lentils, one of the specials.  

""We don't have lentils,"" he tells me.  

""Oh."" I have no Plan B. I stand there, lost, an anathema to his fast-moving system.  

""We didn't make them,"" he tells me. ""It's too hot.""  

""But I like them,"" I say meekly, as if we are having a conversation.  

He glares at me. I lean to get view of the chalkboard and blurt out the only other thing that I can see. ""Albondigas con arroz."" I do not  understand why it is too hot for lentils and not too hot for meatballs with rice but no one else seems concerned.  

The man scribbles the price on a small piece of paper and hands it to me. I shove it in my pocket, grumpy that he doesn't trust me to understand the numbers. ""I'll pay by QR,"" I say, like I'm a local just masquerading like a  lost tourist.  

He waves me to the counter, a narrow area crammed with hungry office workers and freelancers looking ready to make their next deal. The man behind the counter is moving fast, handing out plates of food. Then he barks for the next person to give him their order.  

With horror, I realise that I have to hand over the scribbled number on a slip: it wasn't for *me*, it was for this guy. I hand him my rumpled slip and ask for meatballs to eat here, perching on a high stool.  

A  few minutes later,  he slides a plate towards me, heaped with rice and three large meatballs.  

 ""Albondigas para dos,"" he says.  

""No, no.""  This is meatballs for two, and I'm only me, I  say, confusedly.  

He pauses, his face creased with concern. What's wrong? Do I not wan this?  

I'm breaking the system again. ""_Soy sola_,"" I say, I'm alone, and then spot my mistake. I think I just informed the guy that I'm single.  

He holds my gaze.  

No one else claims the plate. And who the hell serves three meatballs for two people. Never mind, I tell  him. It's fine. Don't worry.  

He frowns and then flies back into chaotic motion, taking orders, handing out the results. I'm halfway through my meal when I hear it again: his voice, handing a takeaway box to someone else. _Para vos_. For you. Singular. Direct. Only in Argentina.  

Even the simplest of interactions are fraught for me here. I pull out my phone to get my next instruction from Blue Man.  

His text says I don't need to come to him. Finish my shopping. He can send a motorbike courier to me.  

This is not what I expected.  

I thought that we would meet in some indoor back room.  Some fluorescent-lit space with a counter and chairs and CCTV. And witnesses. I remember my hostel manager: never make transaction on the street.  

I ask him straight: I meet a guy on a motorbike who just... pays me?  

Yes, exactly. Once the funds hit the Blue Man's wallet, motorbike man will hand me the envelope.  

An envelope. Could be anything. Receipts. Cut-up newspapers. A polite threat. And how is motorbike man going to know that the money went through?  

I don't like any of this.  

I message back that I need to know the envelope actually has money in it. Before I do the transaction. I admit that I don't know how  to do this in a trustless way.  

There is no problem, he tells me. His very good friend Pomelo recommended him to me, he reminds me. This is meant to represent trust.  

I message Pomelo: is he actually a very good friend? Would he trust him with cash?  

At the same time I message Blue Man again. Pomelo is not *my* good friend. He's just some guy I met in an  ice cream shop.  

Somewhere between all this, I find a keyboard. It's not pink but it will do.  

I want to point out to Blue Man that I'm a woman alone, in a foreign city, explain why this setup is starting to feel physically dangerous.  But he already knows that I'm a foreigner. Assumes I don't speak Spanish. My real name. He knows a hell of a lot more about me than I do about him. There really isn't anything I can add to that.  

A message from Pomelo. Yes, this is a real friend and yes, he'd trust him.  They could be in this together, of course. But Pomelo is plugged into the local Ethereum scene. He has a reputation. Something to lose.  

Blue Man is waiting. I stall. Tell him that I'm looking for a place to meet the courier. ""As long as I can see the cash first,"" I text, ""we're good.""  

I find a place to sit in the middle of the avenue, the Obelisk towering above me, and try to think this through.  

I've moved from my hostel room to a dingy hotel on the other side of the Avenida. Motorbike guy could meet me there. Not my room—god no—but in the lobby. The front desk is staffed by a guy who looks like personal protection, with arms the size of my thighs.  

If it goes sideways with motorbike guy, he might not take my side. He might not even look up. But it's indoors, big windows, a busy street. CCTV, probably.  

I don't care about my stuff. If the burner phone gets grabbed, it doesn't matter. The wallet is synched elsewhere. I have already learned where to buy a keyboard. What I need is at least a hint of physical protection. I am not actually able to put my trust into strangers with pseudonyms and cash in envelopes.  

I send Blue Man a screenshot of $400 in pesos pegged to the blue rate. It's up ten pesos since this morning. He offers a round number, asks if I want large bills or small. He's happy with the lobby. He's going to come personally, he tells me, so that I can feel more comfortable.  

This means that Blue Man will know where I'm staying, not just some guy on a motorbike. But at this point, I'm out of ideas.  

Another message from Blue Man. ""Can we do this now?""  

I tell him I'll be there in twenty.

1pbpoti,https://www.reddit.com/r/azerbaijan/comments/1pbpoti/leo_bank_prime_card_business_model/,Leo Bank - Prime Card Business Model,"Hi team,

I have noticed that many of my Azerbaijani friends are using Leobank, which seems like a very modern approach to banking and something that in my country would be called a neobank. It offers many convenient features, transfers, lounge access, and even support through multiple social media channels.

Today, one of my friends told me she used a ""free"" VIP airport transfer to Baku and also accessed an airport lounge through Leobank. Since nothing is truly free, I became curious about how this makes financial sense for the bank.

From what I found, you have to pay 50 AZN for the card plus 10 AZN each month to use it. In return, you receive VIP transfers, several free lounge visits, taxi rides, free Costa Coffees, even concierge service, and other banking services. My question is, how is this sustainable for them? Are many customers paying for Leo Prime but not fully using these free perks? Do they rely on revenue from loans with high interest rates or other credit products to cover the costs? What am I missing?

It's super heavy, especially when I've got it loaded up with paper.  

In the past, I built a little rolling base for it out of 1x6 boards with heavy duty casters.  It was just four boards in a rectangle fit to the same dimensions as the flat file, with the flat file set on top.  The base worked well for a couple of years until I had to move, and one of the movers broke it when rolling it to the truck.  Iirc, the break point was where the boards were connected, not the casters.

What's a better way to do this?  Should I just cut a sheet of plywood to size?  Use thicker boards?  MDF?  I'd like it to still look nice as I sometimes use it as a coffee table.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!",2,1764625082.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,1.0,False
1pbpnyv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbpnyv,Best powerbank ever,"I got this powerbank at a coffee expo in Berlin in 2019. It was THE BEST powerbank I've had a pleasure of using. And I've also used many name brand ones.
It was charging fast, it was not too heavy, it lasted forever.
Unfortunately it got some water treatment (not the first time, mind you) that made it stop charging. It even still works! Just stops charging after a few seconds.

I'm trying to find the same one. I found it a couple months ago online and I thought I saved it for when I'm in the US but now I can't find it again.

Easy - Christmas tree ornaments:  1. Take some scrap 1-1.5” angle iron 2. Draw 3-4 inch tall pine trees on the angle iron. Draw them like you’re in Kindergarten! 3. Cut them out with an angle grinder and cut off wheel. (Last two pics) 4. Heat them in a forge then bash them flat angle side up. 5. Use a chisel to tap in some details on the boughs. Lack of precision is fine! Haha! 6. Smooth the needle sharp points and edges off on the grinder or with a flap disk. Polish lightly with a wire wheel. 7. Drill a hole for the ribbon and hot coat them with beeswax. 8. Six inch ribbon curls, honey!

A bit harder/ more work:

Tea light holders for mason jars. Great video on YouTube from Christ Centered Iron Works. I substituted a copper dish. (Scrap copper pipe, annealed, cut, opened into squares, pop a tea light sized dish into them using the flat side of a big ball peen hammer set on them over a slightly bigger round swage hole and whacked with a wood mallet)

Copper coffee scoops: lots of videos on YouTube. You can make your handles fancy with leaves, hearts and tapers. Or crank them out quickly with simple twists or tapers in small bar stock. I make my scoops from scrap copper pipe cut into circles with a big tin snips, dished out with a ball peen on a hickory stump swage, and planished over a ball die. You can buy a steel swage and ball die from Housemade.us. Black Bear Forge even uses the swage and ball on a press to save time dishing!

1pbphsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1pbphsc/how_reading_makes_you_hotter_and_saner_the_brain/,How reading makes you HOTTER and SANER: the brain upgrade social media doesn't want you to know,"Everyone I know is scrolling. In line for coffee? Scroll. In bed at 2am? Scroll. Even while watching TV, they're scrolling on a second screen. We’ve become passive dopamine junkies, rewiring our brains every day with fragmented content that never asks us to think deeply, feel fully, or focus for more than 10 seconds. The result? Shorter attention spans, more anxiety, and a weird sense of emptiness even after hours online.

This post isn’t some moral panic. It’s a deep dive into something I noticed in myself and in others, how reading, real reading, can actually help reverse the damage. I dug into books, neuroscience papers, YouTube interviews, and podcasts. Not from clout-chasing influencers but from legit researchers and thinkers. Social media addiction isn’t your fault. It’s engineered. But there’s a science-backed way to escape it, and reading is one of the most powerful tools we have.

**Reading literally rewires your brain.** Unlike TikTok’s 7-second clips, books force your brain into what neuroscientists call ""deep work"" mode. You enter sustained focus, which helps rebuild your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for decision-making, self-control, and long-term planning. Dr. Maryanne Wolf, author of *Reader, Come Home*, found that skimming online has actually damaged our ability to read deeply, but we can retrain it. It’s not just about books, it’s about reclaiming cognitive control.

**It also trains your attention span like a muscle.** A 2020 study published in the journal *Nature Communications* showed that chronic digital media use leads to “disrupted attentional control,” basically meaning your focus gets hijacked every few seconds. Reading slows you down. It stretches the time between dopamine hits, which resets your brain’s reward system. Over time, this gives you more mental stamina and makes social media way less gripping.

**You actually start feeling emotions again.** Sounds weird, but endless scrolling flattens your emotional range. You’re bouncing from a war video to a thirst trap to a meme about burnout in under 10 seconds. Reading slows the emotional tempo. Stories give you space to sit with complex feelings. According to Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist and author of *Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain*, the brain uses storytelling to regulate emotions. Books help us re-learn empathy, nuance, and presence.

**Here’s the part no one talks about: it’s also aesthetic.** The more time you spend reading, the more articulate, present, and interesting you become. It shows in how you speak, how you think, and even how you carry yourself. You start forming original opinions. Your voice deepens. You stop sounding like a Twitter thread. It’s a full mental glow-up.

**Here’s what helped me rewire** and make reading my new favorite addiction:

**Atomic Habits by James Clear** is that rare self-help book that actually lives up to the hype. It sold over 15 million copies for a reason. Clear breaks down habit formation in a non-cringe, science-based way. What changed everything for me was this idea: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Building a reading habit isn’t about willpower. It’s about reducing friction. I started leaving books on my pillow, so they were the last thing I touched before sleep.

**Stolen Focus by Johann Hari** shattered every delusion I had about attention. It’s not just about tech, it’s about systems, from education to food to sleep, that are destroying our ability to concentrate. Hari interviewed over 250 experts in neuroscience, psychiatry, and tech. One line hit hard: “The truth is, we’ve been trained to crave interruption.” It made me realize reading isn’t just leisure, it’s rebellion.

**The Ezra Klein Show** podcast has become a brain gym for me. His interviews aren’t surface-level. He dives deep with thinkers like Cal Newport (author of *Digital Minimalism*) and Nicholas Carr (*The Shallows*). Listening to long-form conversations actually increased my capacity to focus. I play one episode during a walk, let myself absorb it fully, then journal about one new thought it gave me.

**Endel** has been a game changer when I want to read but my brain's buzzing with noise. It’s this adaptive soundscape app that generates background music based on your heart rate, time of day, and focus level. It makes reading sacred again. I switch to “Focus” mode and suddenly it’s like my mind puts on blinders. It also helps me avoid reaching for my phone every five minutes.

**BeFreed** is now my go-to during commutes or when I’m walking to grab groceries. It creates these insanely smart audio explainers that feel like mini podcasts just for me. I told it I wanted to understand “how to stop doomscrolling and fix my attention,” and it made a five-part audio series drawing from books, research papers, and real interviews. I could interrupt the audio to ask follow-up questions (like “wait, why does dopamine spike with novelty?”), and it would go deeper, right there. What really sells it for me is how adaptive it is. If I start getting more into topics like memory or communication, it builds on that in my next session. Even the voice tone adapts, sometimes I switch to a more energetic host when I need motivation. Way more engaging than trying to read academic PDFs or scroll through Reddit for answers.

**The YouTube channel After Skool** is perfect for resets when I feel like I’m slipping into zombie scroll mode again. Their illustrated videos on psychology, philosophy, and productivity are mesmerizing. One favorite: “How Social Media Hacks Your Brain”, straight up terrifying but necessary. It visualizes how platforms farm your attention like a commodity. Watching that made me want to delete half my apps and pick up a paperback.

**The War of Art by Steven Pressfield** is the most slept-on weapon against distraction. Pressfield calls procrastination and self-doubt “Resistance” with a capital R. He writes like a drill sergeant philosopher. This book made me approach reading, not as relaxation, but as battle prep for a focused, original life. It’s the best $10 you’ll ever spend if you want to stop frittering your life away clicking things you won’t even remember tomorrow.

Start small. Read 5 pages. Don’t post about it. Just let your brain remember what it feels like to think in full sentences again. Then notice how the scroll doesn’t hit the same anymore.

1pbph9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pbph9p/it_took_me_11_years_to_quit_caffeine_and_i_still/,It took me 11 years to quit caffeine and I still can’t do a pull-up,"I wanted to share a few stats about how long it took for me to see any change in my nutrition, fitness and sleep habbits so that people can get a realistic view of how change works in life, not to compare but so you can see the  - rather measured and boring truth -  rather than the glossy social media version. 

**Food**   
Drank caffeine since I was 18. Finally managed to kick the habbit at about 29, after going on Sertraline and using Propanalol, which seemed to calm my nervous system enough to the point I didn't want it anymore. 

Only really ate oven food and ready meals - typical beige meals - until I was in my mid 20s. Tail end of 20s and early 30s, I've really levelled up the quality of the food I eat (e.g. less processed), but I am still struggling to get enough fats, nuts, and seeds to this day... 

Been trying to give up the 2 sweeteners in my tea and coffee since I first started drinking these hot drinks in my late teens, but still no success... 

**Movement**   
Been doing to the gym regularly since I was about 16, but only in the last 3 years (I'm 34), have I actually managed to stick to going boxing once per week - almost religiously.   
  
Had a pull up bar in my house for about 3 years, still cannot do 1 pull up (I am female). Have recently bought a band after realising that I need to make the entry point a bit lower if I ever want to achieve my goal. I thought it would be enough to just do lower downs, but it was just too hard and therefore I couldn't get the consistency needed to progress. 

Still can't do a proper strict push-up despite years of trying (obviously it's not been my sole goal in life, but my activity levels and routine around weights has been steadily increasing over the last few years). 

**Sleep**  
I only started tracking my sleep daily about 3 years ago when I got an apple watch. It's crazy, now looking at how much I slept is always the first thing I do when I wake up to get a gauge on what I'm working with for the day - below 7 hours (take it easy), above 8 hours (let's go). 

The things I have spoken about here - FOOD / MOVEMENT / SLEEP - I think are the keys to self-improvement. Only when we are well rested, nourished and healthy can we really achieve anything in life. 

I have sought to make this triad the foundation of my life, inching myself out bit by bit of my habits to better ones. But as you can see, it's taken years... 

I track all of this in a little web app I built for myself to stay accountable day by day – happy to share if anyone’s interested, but mainly I just wanted to offer a more boring, realistic picture of what change has actually looked like for me.

“Dumpster Fire Day”

(By a Very Tired Preschool Teacher)

Verse 1
I walked in the door with my coffee in hand,
Ready for calm like I actually had a plan.
But three kids were crying, one climbed on a chair,
Somebody whispered “zombie blood” — I said a silent prayer.
Glue sticks open, glitter on the floor,
And someone’s snack is mashed against the door.

Pre-Chorus
Oh, I counted to ten ’til I hit twenty-four,
’Cause it’s only 9 a.m. and I’m already done for.

Chorus
It’s a dumpster fire day, and I’m the one holding the hose,
Trying to put out flames no one else even knows.
Chaos is swirling like a preschool choir,
Yep — another beautiful, magical, tiny-human dumpster fire.

Verse 2
Johnny said he’s a killer robot (with hugs),
Sara’s making potions out of sidewalk chalk and bugs.
The dramatic play corner is a crime scene again,
And someone found the scissors — dear God, not again.
The sensory bin is now a “lake for dinosaurs,”
And I’m pretty sure that’s syrup on the floor.

Pre-Chorus
I breathe deep in, try to keep my cool,
Remember: bickering is “skills,” not mutiny in school.

Chorus
It’s a dumpster fire day, and I’m the one holding the hose,
Trying to put out flames no one else even knows.
Chaos is swirling like a preschool choir,
Yep — another beautiful, magical, tiny-human dumpster fire.

Bridge
But then someone shares a toy,
Another kid builds a tower,
Some little voice whispers
“Teacher, look! I have superpowers!”
And for a moment everything’s fine,
The world stops melting down…
’Til someone flushes half a roll of paper
And we go back to clown-town.

Final Chorus
It’s a dumpster fire day, and I’m still standing here,
Laughing so I don’t cry — sipping day-old coffee like it’s beer.
Through the slime, the screams, the questionable “art”…
I wouldn’t trade these little chaos-goblins —
Bless my preschool teacher heart.

Outro

So raise a cup to the wild and wired,
Another day survived in the preschool dumpster fire. 🔥❤️",0,1764624548.0,ECEProfessionals,0,0.5,False

## 1-The Amoral Calculus

Let me start with an uncomfortable truth I had to face: if death is absolute terminus, if consciousness simply ceases and no accounting follows, then morality is merely a social fiction—a useful lie we tell ourselves to enable cooperation.

Game theory reveals the structure beneath our pretenses. I am a rational agent seeking to maximize utility. My life is finite. My resources are scarce. Every moment spent on ""moral"" action that doesn't serve my interests is, strictly speaking, waste.

Consider the logic:

**Why be honest?** Only if detection risk × punishment cost > gains from deception. If I can lie without consequence, honesty is irrational. It's leaving utility on the table.

**Why be just?** Only if reputation benefits > immediate exploitation gains. If I can extract value from others without reputational damage, justice is a handicap I'm placing on myself while others optimize freely.

**Why help the poor?** Only if it signals status, builds political capital, or generates warm feelings that I value. If none of these apply, every dirham spent on charity is a dirham I could have spent on myself.

**Why restrain my appetites?** Only if the pleasure now < future costs (health, social standing, legal risk). If I can indulge without consequence—if I have power, wealth, or simply good luck—restraint is simply foregone pleasure.

This isn't cynicism. This is clarity.

The game theorist doesn't ask ""Is this right?"" but rather ""What are the payoffs?"" And in a purely mortal frame, the payoffs reduce to: pleasure, power, resources, status, legacy—all bounded by death.

---

##2- The Consequences of Consistency

If I truly believe life ends at death, why am I playing gently?

The person who believes in pure mortality but still constrains themselves with ""morals"" is either:

1. Insufficiently rational (failing to optimize)
2. Evolutionarily conditioned (confusing genetic imperatives for personal utility)
3. Socially captured (internalizing others' rules as if they were their own)

None of these are *choosing* morality. They're being constrained by biology or society—external forces, not reasoned conviction.

Let me be honest about what pure mortality implies:

**On corruption:** If I'm in a position where I can embezzle without detection, why wouldn't I? The money has real utility—security, comfort, opportunities for my children. The ""wrong"" done to society is abstract, diffuse, unreal compared to the concrete benefit I receive. Society is an abstraction; my family's wellbeing is tangible.

**On exploitation:** If I had a business and could underpay workers because they're desperate, why wouldn't I? Their suffering is their problem. My profit is my gain. In the amoral calculus, their utility function is not my concern—only mine matters.

**On betrayal:** If I can betray a trust to advance myself, and the betrayed party cannot retaliate, why hesitate? Loyalty that costs me is simply a bad trade. The ""emotional"" argument—guilt, shame—is just evolutionary programming. Overcome it and I've gained an edge.

**On pleasure:** If I can take what I want—property, opportunity, even dignity from others—and escape punishment, what restrains me? The law? Only when it's enforced. Social judgment? Only if I'm caught. Internal guilt? That's just neurochemistry I haven't yet mastered.

This is the world of pure mortality. There is no judge. There is no accounting. There is only power and its absence.

And here's the demonstration by absurd: **No one actually lives this way consistently.**

Even atheists who claim to believe in mortality's finality still restrain themselves. They speak of ""ethics"" and ""principles."" But where do these come from? If they've reduced reality to atoms and mortality to cessation, principles are just preferences—and preferences can be overcome by stronger incentives.

Why do they help someone when no one is watching? Why do they keep promises when breaking them is profitable? Why do they feel guilt at all?

Either they're irrational—failing to optimize their utility—or they don't actually believe their own premises about mortality.

---

##3- The Transition: When the Game Changes

But now—let me consider a different possibility.

What if death is not the end? What if there is accounting? What if every action, every choice, every secret thought is recorded and will be weighed?

Suddenly, the entire payoff matrix transforms.

I'm no longer playing a finite game against other mortals, trying to extract maximum utility before the clock runs out. I'm playing an *infinite game* against an omniscient judge who sees not just my actions but my intentions.

**The game structure changes fundamentally:**

**In the mortal game:**
- Hidden defection is profitable (no one knows, no punishment)
- Short-term extraction is rational (maximize before death)
- Others' welfare is irrelevant (their utility ≠ my utility)
- Exploitation is optimal (if I have power, use it)

**In the eternal game:**
- Hidden defection is maximally costly (God knows, punishment is certain)
- Long-term investment is rational (eternity >> any earthly gain)
- Others' welfare is my concern (harming them is recorded against me)
- Exploitation is catastrophic (temporary gain, eternal loss)

This isn't a small adjustment. This is a complete inversion of optimal strategy.

---

##4- A Note on Scope

Before I continue, I should be clear about what this is.

This is an analysis I made for myself—a framework I needed to think through the strategic implications of what I claim to believe. I'm Muslim, so naturally I'm working within the Islamic framework because that's the one I'm accountable to.

---

##5- The Binary Nature of Belief

Here I had to confront a critical error in my own thinking: the idea of partial belief.

I cannot believe 90% in divine judgment. I cannot believe 50%. I cannot hedge my bets at 99%.

Either I believe there is a God who will judge me, or I don't. Either I believe Paradise and Hell are real destinations, or I don't. Either I believe my actions are being recorded, or I don't.

**There is no middle ground.**

When I say ""I believe, but..."" I'm describing doubt, not belief. When I say ""I'm mostly sure,"" I'm describing uncertainty, not conviction. When I ""believe"" but act as if there's no accounting, I'm revealing the truth: I don't actually believe.

Think of it this way: If someone tells me ""I believe this building is on fire, but I'm going to finish my coffee before leaving,"" what do they actually believe? Not that the building is on fire. Perhaps they believe there's smoke. Perhaps they believe there might be danger. But they don't believe the building is on fire—because belief at that level *compels action*.

The same applies to divine judgment. If I truly believe—with full conviction, not intellectual assent—that I will stand before my Creator and account for every moment, every choice, every dirham, every glance, every thought—my behavior must reflect that reality.

**If it doesn't, I don't believe. It's that simple.**

This analysis addresses two versions of myself:

1. **If I have true conviction:** I need the strategic framework to optimize my actions accordingly.
2. **If I'm claiming belief without conviction:** I need to confront the contradiction between what I claim and how I live.

There is no third category. The version of me ""in between""—claiming 80% certainty or 95% conviction—is functionally identical to the non-believer. I'm making the same calculations, accepting the same tradeoffs, living for the same temporal outcomes.

Why? Because I either know the exam is real, or I'm guessing. And if I'm guessing, I'm not betting my life on it. I'm hedging—which means I'm playing the mortal game with some anxiety about being wrong.

That's not belief. That's intellectual uncertainty dressed in religious vocabulary.

---

##6- The Single-Player Optimization

For the version of me with true belief, here's the revelation that changes everything: **I don't need others to play correctly for me to win.**

In standard game theory, I'm trapped in interdependence. If others defect, my cooperation gets exploited. If others are corrupt, my honesty is a competitive disadvantage. I need coordination, enforcement, collective action.

But with divine judgment, I've moved to a single-player game. My optimal strategy is *invariant to what others do.*

**Others are corrupt?** I'll be honest anyway—my payoff comes from divine approval, not earthly success.

**Others exploit me?** I'll bear it—the temporary loss is nothing compared to eternal reward.

**Society is unjust?** I'll act justly—I'm not trying to fix society, I'm optimizing my own eternal outcome.

I am liberated from the coordination problem. I don't need to wait for institutions to change, for others to reform, for society to reach threshold. I simply execute my dominant strategy: **act in accordance with divine command.**

The result is guaranteed—not in this life, but in the accounting that follows.

---

##7-The Exam Framework

I understand this life as an exam. Not metaphorically—literally. An actual test with actual consequences.

And like any exam, the question is: **How do I maximize my score?**

The rational student doesn't ask ""Is this exam fair to everyone?"" They ask: ""What's being tested? What's the grading rubric? How do I optimize my preparation?""

The exam is fair precisely because it's the same fundamental test for everyone: *Will I submit to my Creator, or will I worship myself?*

The rich man is tested with wealth: Will he be grateful or arrogant? Will he share or hoard?

The poor man is tested with hardship: Will he be patient or bitter? Will he persevere or despair?

The intelligent are tested with knowledge: Will they be humble or proud? Will they use it for good or exploitation?

The simple are tested with their limitations: Will they be sincere or resentful?

**The exam is not identical—but it is equitable.** Everyone is tested at their capacity, with their circumstances, according to their knowledge.

The child who dies young: tested within their capacity, judged accordingly.

Someone with intellectual disability: tested within their capacity, judged accordingly.

Someone who never hears the message clearly: tested on what they knew, judged accordingly.

Someone raised in ignorance: tested on what they could access, judged accordingly.

The exam scales to capacity. No soul is burdened beyond what it can bear.

But—and here's where I need to be honest with myself—**if I have access to clear guidance and reject it, that's on me.**

---

##8- Maximizing Information: The Advantage of Clear Guidance

If life is an exam, I want maximum information about:
- What's being tested
- What constitutes a passing grade
- What strategies are optimal
- What mistakes to avoid

The Islamic framework provides me this information advantage.

The Quran and Sunnah are literally the exam guidelines. They tell me:
- What actions carry reward (the scoring rubric)
- What actions carry punishment (the penalty structure)
- What intentions matter (the grading criteria)
- What traps to avoid (common failure modes)

As a rational agent facing an exam with access to the study guide, I would be *irrational* not to use it.

Consider the structure:

**Clear requirements:** Five pillars—observable, measurable, explicit. Not vague principles but concrete actions.

**Defined prohibitions:** Riba, zina, alcohol, oppression—the red lines are marked. I know exactly what to avoid.

**Weighted priorities:** Obligations (fard) vs. recommendations (sunnah) vs. permissibles (mubah). I can optimize based on importance.

**Accounting details:** How actions are multiplied, how intentions are weighed, how repentance functions. The scoring system is explained.

**Edge cases resolved:** Fiqh has worked through thousands of scenarios. Most questions I face have precedent, analysis, guidance.

This is an *extraordinary* information advantage. Most of humanity is taking the exam blind—guessing at what matters, hoping their intuitions are correct, uncertain whether their actions will count for or against them.

I have the answer key.

Yet how often do I ignore it? How often do I have the guidance but act as if I'm guessing? How often do I know the rules but play as if there are none?

---

##9- The Rational Believer's Strategy

So if I believe—truly believe, with full conviction—what's my optimal strategy?

The answer is obvious: **Perfect adherence to divine command.**

Every action becomes an investment in eternity:

**Every salah:** Five minutes, five times daily. Minimal temporal cost. Infinite potential benefit.

**Every zakah:** 2.5% of wealth. Trivial compared to eternal stakes.

**Every restraint from haram:** Temporary pleasure foregone. Eternal punishment avoided.

**Every act of justice:** Possible earthly cost (standing up to power). Guaranteed eternal reward.

**Every moment of sabr (patience):** Enduring tests with dignity. Earning divine approval.

I should be the *most* disciplined optimizer in existence. Not because I'm morally superior, but because I'm calculating correctly.

If I had a business: I should refuse riba even when it's costly. Not because I'm ""ethical"" in some abstract sense, but because I'm optimizing for eternal outcomes. The interest I'd earn in 40 years of business is *nothing*—literally, mathematically nothing—compared to even a single day in Paradise.

In my relationships: I should honor commitments even when breaking them would benefit me. Not because I'm ""honorable"" as a personality trait, but because the One whose judgment matters sees everything. My reputation with people is temporary. My standing with my Creator is permanent.

In private: I should restrain appetites not when others watch, but when alone. Because my optimization isn't about reputation—it's about reality. The pleasure I'd gain from haram is finite. The consequence is infinite.

This is what rational belief looks like for me. Every choice filtered through a simple question: *What does this action mean for eternity?*

---

##10-The Nature of Perfection: Effort, Not Flawlessness

But here I need to address something critical that I initially misunderstood: what does ""perfect adherence"" actually mean?

It doesn't mean flawless execution. It means honest effort.

The exam isn't graded on perfection—it's graded on sincerity and striving. The perfect score isn't zero mistakes; it's doing the best I can with the abilities I have, with genuine intention to improve.

**This is crucial because it changes everything about how I approach the strategy.**

If I think perfection means never making a mistake, I'm doomed from the start. I'll fail, feel hopeless, and either give up or live in constant anxiety. Neither of these is what the exam requires.

Instead, the optimal strategy looks like this:

**1. Commit to the path:** I make a clear decision that I'm playing the eternal game, not the mortal one. This is the foundational choice.

**2. Execute to the best of my current ability:** I pray when I can, even if my focus wavers. I avoid haram to the extent I'm able, even if I struggle. I fulfill obligations even when it's difficult.

**3. When I fail, I acknowledge and correct:** I don't rationalize. I don't pretend it wasn't a failure. I recognize it, feel genuine remorse, repent sincerely, and return to the path.

**4. I continuously work to expand my capacity:** Today's ""best I can do"" should not be the same as next year's ""best I can do."" I should be growing, learning, strengthening my adherence over time.

**This is what honest effort looks like.** And here's the beautiful part: this IS the perfect score.

If I'm doing my genuine best at my current level, I'm not judged as if I should be performing at some higher level beyond my capacity. The exam scales to my capacity. My ""best"" is judged relative to what I'm actually capable of—not some absolute standard divorced from my circumstances.

But—and this is the critical distinction—**""my best"" is probably much higher than what I tell myself I can do.**

---

##11- The Gap Between Perceived and Actual Capacity

Here's where I need to be brutally honest with myself: I often confuse ""difficult"" with ""impossible"" and ""uncomfortable"" with ""unable.""

When I say ""I can't wake up for Fajr,"" do I mean:
- It's physically impossible? No.
- It's uncomfortable and I don't want to? Yes.

When I say ""I can't avoid this haram transaction,"" do I mean:
- There's literally no other option? Rarely.
- The halal option is more difficult, costly, or inconvenient? Usually.

When I say ""I can't control my anger/lust/greed,"" do I mean:
- I have zero agency? No.
- It's hard and requires discipline I haven't built yet? Yes.

**The exam tests me at my actual capacity, not my perceived capacity.** And my actual capacity is almost always higher than I think.

This is where the intention and effort become crucial. If I genuinely cannot do something—if I'm tested beyond my actual capacity—I'm not accountable for that. A person in poverty can't give zakah they don't have. A person with severe mental illness may not be able to control certain behaviors.

But if I *can* do something and I'm just choosing not to because it's hard? That's not inability. That's choice.

So the question I need to ask myself constantly is: **Am I actually at my limit, or am I just uncomfortable?**

My ""best"" in any situation isn't defined by what's comfortable or convenient. It's defined by what I'm actually capable of when I'm honest about the stakes.

---

##12- The Honest Assessment

Let me think through what honest effort looks like in different areas:

**Salah:**
- Can I pray five times daily? Yes, barring extreme circumstances.
- Can I pray with perfect concentration? No, that's a skill I'm building.
- Can I pray on time? Yes, with planning and discipline.
- Can I occasionally miss because I'm genuinely unconscious or in an emergency? Yes, and that's accounted for.
- Can I regularly miss because I'm lazy or distracted? No, that's not my limit—that's my choice.

Honest effort: Pray all five, work on improving concentration over time, don't excuse laziness as inability.

**Avoiding haram:**
- Can I completely eliminate all traces of riba from a modern financial system? Very difficult, maybe impossible in some cases.
- Can I refuse to deliberately engage in interest-based transactions when alternatives exist? Yes.
- Can I never feel tempted by haram? No, temptation isn't the sin.
- Can I choose not to act on haram temptations? Yes, always, though the difficulty varies.

Honest effort: Avoid what I can control, work to extricate myself from what I can't, don't act on temptations even when it's hard.

**Justice and integrity:**
- Can I fix all injustice in society? No, that's beyond my capacity.
- Can I refuse to personally participate in injustice? Yes, almost always.
- Can I speak truth to power without any cost? Often no, there are real risks.
- Can I speak truth even when there's cost, if the cost isn't catastrophic? Yes, and this is part of the test.

Honest effort: Don't participate in oppression, speak truth where I can, accept that some costs are part of the exam.

**Zakah and charity:**
- Can I give more than I possess? No, that's impossible.
- Can I calculate and give my zakah obligation? Yes, if I have the minimum threshold.
- Can I give additional charity beyond obligation? Depends on my situation, but often more than I think.

Honest effort: Fulfill obligations precisely, give additional charity according to genuine capacity, not just comfort level.

---

##13- The Bitter Mirror

Now here's where I have to confront an uncomfortable reality about myself.

If I claim to believe in judgment, in Paradise and Hell, in divine accounting—but my behavior doesn't reflect infinite stakes—then I don't believe.

Not partially. Not insufficiently. Not ""working on it.""

**I don't believe.**

But wait—didn't I just say the exam is about effort, not perfection? Yes. So let me clarify the distinction:

**The person with genuine belief who fails:**
- They commit to the strategy (playing the eternal game)
- They execute to their actual capacity, not perceived comfort level
- When they fail, they feel genuine remorse—not because of consequences, but because they've failed the One who matters
- They repent sincerely and immediately return to trying
- They work consistently to expand their capacity over time
- Their trajectory is upward, even if it includes setbacks

**The person without genuine belief:**
- They claim to play the eternal game but optimize for the mortal one
- They execute only to their comfort level, then claim that's their capacity
- When they fail, they rationalize it away or plan to ""fix it later""
- They treat repentance as a reset button that allows planned disobedience
- They don't work to expand capacity—they expect the exam to adjust to them
- Their trajectory is flat or downward, justified by excuses

Let me be direct with myself: If I believe I will stand before Allah and account for every moment, every dirham, every choice—and I still habitually choose haram over halal for worldly gain—**I am lying about my belief.**

The occasional failure followed by genuine remorse and renewed effort? That's human and expected.

The pattern of calculated disobedience followed by perfunctory ""repentance"" followed by the same calculated disobedience? That's not belief. That's gaming a system I don't actually think exists.

---

##14- The Test Is Simple

Here's my diagnostic for myself: Look at my choices when no human is watching. When there's no social pressure, no reputation at stake, no earthly consequence. What do I do?

**When I'm alone with the opportunity for haram:**

If I have genuine belief:
- I refrain, even though it's difficult
- Or I fail, feel immediate remorse, and sincerely repent
- My internal experience is one of struggle against desire, not casual indulgence

If I don't have genuine belief:
- I indulge without significant internal conflict
- Or I tell myself ""just this once"" repeatedly
- My internal experience is one of rationalization, not struggle

**When I can profit from injustice no one will discover:**

If I have genuine belief:
- I don't do it, even though it would benefit me
- Or I'm tempted, do it, then feel genuine agony and confess/correct it
- My internal experience is knowing I'm being watched

If I don't have genuine belief:
- I do it and feel clever for getting away with it
- Or I feel mild guilt but tell myself everyone does it
- My internal experience is that only humans judge, and they don't know

**The pattern reveals the truth.**

---

##15- What Genuine Effort Looks Like

So let me paint a picture of what I think genuine belief with honest effort actually looks like in practice:

**Morning:** My alarm goes for Fajr. I'm exhausted. Do I get up?
- Genuine belief: Yes, even though it's hard. Or I fail (oversleep), feel terrible, make qadha, set multiple alarms for tomorrow.
- Not genuine: I hit snooze telling myself Allah knows I'm tired. Pattern repeats indefinitely.

**In private:** I'm alone online and one click away from haram content. Do I click?
- Genuine belief: I close it immediately, or I fail and feel sick about it, immediately repent, install filters, tell someone for accountability.
- Not genuine: I click and either feel nothing or tell myself ""just this once"" for the hundredth time.

**With money:** I have extra income. Do I give?
- Genuine belief: I calculate zakah precisely and give it. I look for sadaqah opportunities beyond obligation. I see wealth as a test and responsibility.
- Not genuine: I tell myself I'll give ""when I have more,"" find reasons zakah doesn't apply yet, keep calculating minimum obligations.

**In relationships:** Someone wrongs me and I have power to retaliate. Do I?
- Genuine belief: I either forgive for Allah's sake, or I take only just recompense without excess, or I struggle with anger but work on forgiveness.
- Not genuine: I tell myself they deserve it, I take more than just recompense, I hold grudges and justify them.

**The pattern over time:**
- Genuine belief: Upward trajectory. More salah prayed. Less haram indulged. More justice pursued. More charity given. Not perfect, but improving.
- Not genuine: Flat or declining. Same struggles, same excuses, same patterns. Or improving only in public/social religiosity while private adherence stays static.

---

##16- The Exam Is Fair

I might object to myself: ""But I wasn't raised with strong Islamic education. I struggle with desires. The society around me makes it hard. How is this fair?""

The exam is fair because I'm tested according to my knowledge and capacity.

Someone raised in ignorance who sincerely didn't know better: Judged on what they knew.

Someone with overwhelming addiction or mental illness: Judged on their struggle to overcome it, not just the outcome.

Someone in a society that makes adherence very difficult: Rewarded extra for the difficulty itself.

But—and this is crucial for me to accept—**I cannot claim ignorance of what I've been clearly taught.** I cannot claim difficulty as an excuse for not trying. I cannot claim society made me do it when I had the choice to refuse.

If I have access to knowledge and reject it: That's on me.

If I have capacity but claim I don't because it's uncomfortable: That's on me.

If I choose comfort over commandment repeatedly: That's on me.

The exam is fair because it's transparent: I know what's required. I know what's prohibited. I know the consequences. I have access to guidance.

What's not fair—what's self-deception—is me claiming belief while refusing honest effort, then expecting divine mercy to bridge the gap I'm not trying to cross.

Mercy is real. Repentance is accepted. Forgiveness is vast. But mercy isn't license for me to ignore the exam while taking it. Repentance isn't a cheat code for planned disobedience.

If I'm planning to sin now and repent later—if that's my actual strategy—I don't believe in judgment. I believe in gaming a system. And I'm gambling that God can be gamed.

That's not a rational bet for me to make.

---

##17- The Final Calculation

Let me end with a simple thought experiment about my own death.

Imagine I'm on my deathbed. Minutes left. No more opportunities to change course. I'm about to find out definitively whether this was all real.

Would I, in that moment, wish I had:
- Made more money?
- Indulged more pleasures?
- Won more arguments?
- Accumulated more status?

Or would I wish I had:
- Prayed more consistently?
- Given more in charity?
- Treated people more justly?
- Restrained myself from haram?
- **Tried harder, even when I failed?**

I know the answer to this. Even if I claimed mortality throughout my life, on my deathbed, I would feel the weight of choices differently.

I wouldn't be thinking ""I wish I had been perfect."" I'd be thinking ""I wish I had genuinely tried. I wish I had been honest about my capacity. I wish I had played the right game.""

Why? Because deep down, even through layers of self-deception, I know. I know that my actions matter beyond the temporal. I know I'm not just atoms. I know there's accounting.

**I shouldn't wait until then.**

My calculation should be clear now, today, with decades potentially ahead. If it's not—if I'm still optimizing primarily for dunya—then I need to ask myself honestly: *Do I actually believe, or am I just identifying as a believer?*

---

##18- Conclusion: The Binary Choice

With mortality—pure, final, absolute mortality—there is no place for morals. There is only power and optimization. The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must. Might makes right because there's no other right to make.

I should play that game if that's what I believe. Play it consistently. Play it hard. Maximize my utility without constraint, because no one is watching and nothing matters beyond my death.

But if I believe in divine judgment—if I truly, completely, without reservation believe that this life is an exam and eternity follows—then I should play that game instead.

Play it with the same clarity of purpose. Play it with honest effort. Play it recognizing that every choice is an investment in infinity.

The strategy isn't flawless execution. It's:
- Commit to the path
- Execute to my actual capacity (not my comfort level)
- When I fail, acknowledge honestly and correct immediately
- Work consistently to expand my capacity
- Let my trajectory be upward, even through setbacks

This is the perfect score: doing the best I genuinely can with sincere intention. Not what I claim I can do. What I actually can do when I'm honest about infinite stakes.

**But I cannot play both games.**

I cannot claim belief while living for mortality. I cannot identify as Muslim while optimizing for dunya. I cannot pray on Friday and engage in riba on Monday. I cannot cry in repentance then plan the same sin.

That's not faith and human weakness. That's self-deception.

I'm either all in or I'm out. Either this life is an exam that determines eternity, or it's not. Either divine judgment is real and my choices matter infinitely, or it's all myth and I should stop pretending.

**There is no middle ground.**

The game is single-player. My optimization is independent of others. My outcome is determined by my honest effort alone.

So I need to make my choice. Not with words, but with actions. Not in public, but in private. Not for others to see, but for the One who sees everything.

Not with perfection, but with genuine, honest, ever-improving effort.

And make it as if infinite utility actually hangs in the balance.

Because if I believe what I claim to believe—it does.

Date was pretty good, we got coffee and walked around for like an hour, conversation flowed fine but afterwards we both kinda just... didnt really follow up much? Like we texted a bit the next day but then it just faded out naturally. No hard feelings or anything, I figured we just werent feeling it enough to pursue more.

Anyway fast forward to yesterday and I walk into this new ramen spot that opened near me (been wanting to try it cause I've got some money saved up for trying new restaurants this month) and guess who's working there as a server? Her. We made eye contact and she definitely recognized me cause she got this look on her face like ""oh shit"" lol.

She came over to take my order and was super professional but also seemed kinda nervous? We did the awkward small talk thing for a minute, she asked how I'd been and I asked about her new job. Then she had to go help other tables obviously.

Here's my thing though.. should I reach out to her on the app again or is that weird now? Part of me thinks maybe the date just had bad timing or something and seeing each other again could be a sign to give it another shot. But I also dont wanna make things awkward for her at her workplace if she's genuinely not interested. Like what if she thinks im gonna show up there all the time now being creepy?

Would it be better to just leave it alone or send her a message saying something casual? I genuinely liked talking to her and the ramen was actually fire so id probably go back anyway lol",40,1764624497.0,dating_advice,6,0.96,False
1pbpefs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbpefs,Gemini Nano Banana Pro is a beast at blueprints and architecture schematics. Here is the prompt to try it out,"Most people look at a building and just see a facade. Engineers look at a building and see a system of forces, tension, and compression.

I’ve been experimenting with Gemini’s new image model (**Nano Banana Pro**) to bridge this gap. I wanted to see if I could force the AI to act as an X-Ray Architect - keeping the beautiful, cinematic photography we love, but overlaying a layer of white chalk intelligence on top.

The results are surprisingly clean, especially because this new model handles text and thin lines much better than previous iterations without hallucinating squiggly nonsense.

Here is the workflow, the prompts, and the logic behind it.

The X-Ray Architect Prompt

The goal here is **Contrast**. We want a tug-of-war between a hyper-realistic photo and a flat, vector blueprint.

**The Prompt Template:**  
  
""A hyper-realistic photography of **\[SUBJECT\]**, overlaid with complex white technical line drawings, architectural blueprint annotations, and vector schematics. The schematics highlight **\[SPECIFIC FEATURE LIKE LOAD BEARING WALLS OR AERODYNAMICS\]**. The style is a blend of National Geographic photography and an Industrial Design Textbook. 8k, sharp focus, cinematic lighting.""

  
For more Blueprint style try this one:

""Create an infographic image of the US Capital in Washington DC blueprint aesthetic with white line drawings on the photograph, technical/architectural annotation style... notable architectural or engineering features.""  
  
Why Nano Banana Pro Changes the Game

  
Older models struggled with this for two reasons:

1. **Line Bleed:** The white lines would blend into the clouds or background textures.
2. **Text Gibberish:** The annotations would look like alien hieroglyphics.

The new model's attention mechanism seems to separate the Overlay layer from the Base layer much more effectively. The text is often legible (or at least looks like real Latin/English characters), and the lines are crisp vectors rather than blurry smudges.

Pro-Tips for Perfect Overlays

1. **Subject Matter Matters:** This works best on things with visible *complexity*.
   * *Good:* Bridges, Engines, Skyscrapers, Watches, Coffee Machines.
   * *Bad:* A smooth beach, a cloudy sky, a simple cube.
2. **Aspect Ratio is Key:**
   * Use **16:9** for Landscapes/Bridges (Horizontal flow).
   * Use **9:16** for Skyscrapers/Rockets (Verticality accentuates the ""height"" data).
3. **The Ghost Effect:** If the blueprint is overpowering the photo, add this to your prompt: *""50% opacity schematics""* or *""subtle wireframe overlay.""*

 Top Use Cases

* **Edutainment:** Explaining how things work (e.g., ""How a jet engine compresses air"") visually.
* **Real Estate Marketing:** Showing the ""bones"" of a house to prove build quality.
* **Sci-Fi Concept Art:** Creating HUD (Heads Up Display) views for cyborgs or Iron Man-style visors.
* **Industrial Design Portfolios:** Showcasing a product and its function in a single image.

👇 Try it out

Copy the prompt above, swap **\[SUBJECT\]** for something around your house (try ""a mechanical keyboard"" or ""a vintage camera""), and post the results below. I want to see what the engineers in this sub can build.

Have hit a point of selection paralysis due to the overwhelming selection out there. But think I’ve narrowed it down: Breville Touch Impress or Ninja Luxe Pro (also open to other recommendations that meet my personal criteria below).

I do understand that the grinder and beans are what make the difference. I currently use an ESP grinder with quality locally roasted beans for just drip coffee on my Technivorm Moccamaster. I’m now wanting to get into the espresso world; mainly to make lattes and cappuccinos since these are what I typically prefer.

Ideally, I don’t want something that is a whole process and manually involved but I also don’t want it be fully automated since everyone I know with automated machines tend to have issues.

For me personally I value: consistent shots, ease of use and cleanup, how well the steamer/frother works, and of course tasting good. I plan to use it just about every single morning to make a quick latte / cappuccino before heading to work. Should also be able to make little tweaks for my personal taste. But it also has to be easy enough for my roommate(s) and guest(s) to use when they want one. For reference, one of my roommates can mess-up using the Technivorm…idk how.

It seems both of these machines meet these requirements, with the Ninja having a +1 being able to do espresso martinis. However, I’m very weary of Ninja as an espresso machine…

I’m not an espresso purists nor care to get into the weeds of the craft but want something that’ll be the best “middle ground” and can allow me browse the surface of the weeds when I want. Really just seeing what Reddit thinks on who makes the better consistently tasting espresso drinks of these two (or others that are similar in pricing and meet these “requirements”)

1pbpcdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cism/comments/1pbpcdp/passed/,Passed!,"Hi All,

Obligatory passed post! Took the exam on Sunday and my god it was such a relief to see the 'Passed' message on the screen. Did a month of rigorous study at least 2-4 hours a day. 

It took me 2.5 hours to finish the whole exam and marked 50 questions for review. I think I changed my answers for 10 of them.

Background:
Bachelor's degree in IT
CompTIA Security+ (this certificate was my gateway into cybersecurity from technical support)
4 years in SOC & Cyber Analyst roles  

Resources used: Numbered most to least favourite 

1. Pete Zerger's CISM course on YouTube:
I personally want to thank this man for his course. No fluff, easy to understand and relate to and a very well structured course. If you're starting off studying would definitely recommend his course.

I printed out his free handouts (presentations of his course materials), binded it into a book and would have that with me almost all the time just to read through.

2. Peter Gregory's AIO Book: Everything I didn't understand from the videos I refered to his book and made notes. Don't get any other book really, this is the one.

3. Official ISACA QAE Hardcopy (10th Edition): Colleague lent me this book. Reading through the answers really gets you into the 'ISACA mindset'. I went through this whole book once and would go through individual domains randomly.

Only gripe with this is that the answers were right after each question. There is a practice test with 150 questions at the back, first go with no study got 54%. Second go few days before the exam got 82%. I was also timing myself per question.

4. 'CISM' App on Android: This application has no affiliation to any of the known CISM content creators or lecturerers. No idea where they got the bank of 700 questions from but it was good to just do this on the way to work or when out. Even had explanations for the right answer. There's a 'practise' & 'test' mode. Questions were similar to the hardcopy QAE. Oh and it was free on the play store! Worth it.

5. Prabh Nair's Coffee Shots: Would listen to this on 1.5x speed at the gym out of all places. He helps you understand how to effectively eliminate wrong answers.

6. Peter Gregory's Practise Questions Book: The questions from this book were nothing like the exam but they are multi layered and helps your understanding quite a bit. 

7. Mark Chapple's Book: Borrowed this from a colleague but I couldn't even get past the first chapter. Very unstructured and hard to gauge what objectives from the course materials you have covered. If you're already going through Pete Zerger's videos and Peter Gregory's AIO, this book will feel way too detailed and boring.

Comments:
The exam was... challenging. Most questions I would know the answer right away but others I would pause to think and then mark to come back thinking time would be my enemy. 

Maybe my preparation was not adequate? Don't know.

By the end of it I was not entirely confident I would pass. They also threw in some questions associated with AI! It threw me off a bit. Oh and the surveys at the end before you get your result. That was not cool.

Suffice to say am absolutely chuffed that I passed. 

Thank you all for sharing your experiences here. It really helped as well. Best of luck to those studying or have their exam coming up!

1pbp82v,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1pbp82v/my_mom_shamed_me_for_how_i_store_decorations/,My mom shamed me for... how I store decorations??,"It's a long one.  And stupid as hell.

So for some context, I don't decorate much for holidays.  I have some Halloween decorations for outside (so kids know it's a trick-or-treating friendly house) and I've only started decorating for Christmas in the past few years.  My mother, by comparison, has *boxes* of decorations for every holiday and Christmas was the highlight of the decorating year for her.  Everything has to be placed just right and it all has to be perfect.  Like, if something was half an inch out of place she'd say, ""What are you doing? Why did you put that there?"" then shift it half an inch and say, ""Now *that* is the right place.""

Honestly, decorating was traumatic.  So when I went to college and eventually got my first apartment I never decorated for any occasion.  But over the past few years, I've been decorating for Christmas.  My now-husband's family didn't do much for Christmas, so I like giving him good holiday vibes he didn't experience when younger.  And a friend of mine was kicked out of his home when he came out at 17 and didn't celebrate the holidays until we became his chosen family.  Another friend was an only child of a single mother, who she lost to cancer a few years ago.  So my home has become the de facto Christmas hub for our little group and decorating and being festive feels nice.

It also helped me realize that my mother just wanted to give us perfect Christmases growing up.

My mother has been in a mood recently and at Thanksgiving I mentioned she should come over this weekend and help decorate.  It'd give us some time to chat and see if there's anything she'd want to open up about.

I keep all my decorations in large plastic bins in the basement.  My husband brought them upstairs and then headed out so I could have so alone time with my mom.  When she arrived, she pointed at the bins and asked, ""What are those?""  I explained they're the Christmas decorations.  Duh.  She seemed annoyed and responded, ""Are you too good for regular cardboard boxes?""  Ok, whatever.  She uses cardboard boxes to store things.

When I opened the first bin (they have these clasps on both sides to secure the top and they make a bit of a noise when you unclasp them), she rolled her eyes at the noise.  One of the clasps on the second bin was a bit tight and needed a bit more effort to unclasp and my mother commented, ""You wouldn't have that problem with a normal cardboard box.""  Seriously?

There were a few more comments about using plastic bins instead of cardboard boxes and I finally got annoyed and said, ""Wow, I didn't have 'justifying how I store decorations' on my 2025 bingo card, but here we go...""  I explained that my basement is dark and musky and the plastic bins help to keep the decorations from smelling like they've been in a dingy basement for a year.  Her response was ""So you're saying my decorations smell?""  I explained that no, she has a finished basement where she stores things, I do not. I also explained it's harder for mice to bite into the bins than a cardboard box (one year we found a hole in one of the boxes of Easter stuff and it had mouse droppings on everything, so we had to throw those decorations away) and her response was, ""My decorations are not covered in vermin!""

She also said they she raised us to be practical and using expensive plastic bins is pretentious.  I think at one point she even said, ""We're cardboard box people,"" like that's a thing, apparently.

I was just like, ""You know what?  This isn't working.  Why don't we go get coffee or go see a movie instead."" And she replied something like, ""You finally ask me for advice on how to decorate properly and now you want to kick me out?!""  So I replied, ""You know what?  Yeah, I'm kicking you out.""

She left and I got a call from my sister that my mom called her and complained that I was rude and kicked her out and I told her it was just mom being a Christmas Nazi again.  Later that night she texted ""Sorry for earlier today.""  I just sent a thumbs up emoji.

1pbp5om,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbp5om,Trip Review: 5 days around La Fortuna in November,"Airport Transportation: 
We used Arenal Rides for round-trip transportation from Liberia airport to La Fortuna and back. We found Arenal Rides through a few other Reddit posts and were so happy we did. We booked through email and then communicated via WhatsApp while on the trip. Geiner (“Jesus”) and Carlos (the owner) met us at the airport with a sign. They helped with luggage and provided ice cold water and beers for the ride (you could request other inclusions). We could have stopped for lunch, but we opted to just make one bathroom stop since we had eaten on the plane. Everything went smoothly, and we felt safe and not too car sick on the drive through the mountains! It helped that Geiner and Carlos were easy to talk to, and they were super welcoming and made the drive feel shorter.

Lodging:
We stayed at Nayara Tented Camp after doing a bunch of research. This was our babymoon trip, so we splurged on the accommodations (and got a pretty good rate by booking when there was a discount). If you can swing it, we highly recommend staying at one of the Nayara properties. It was amazing to wake up every morning and watch the clouds clear and reform around the Arenal Volcano. In my opinion, the room view is worth Nayara Tented Camp over the adults-only Nayara Springs. We saw several families with young kids, but everything was so spread out that we found it was quiet, peaceful, and not crowded at all. 

The grounds are gorgeous, and we spent our afternoons and evenings lounging by our volcanic hot-spring pool, taking advantage of the on-site hot springs, and exploring the grounds looking for frogs, birds, and other wildlife. The resort includes golf carts to get around (the walkways are steep!), an evening frog walk and some other activities, as well as breakfast. Our room looked just like the pictures, and we appreciated the stocked mini-bar, complimentary laundry service, and daily housekeeping and turn-down services. 

We saw a few Reddit posts saying the food at Nayara was whatever, but we were overall happy with breakfast and dinner offerings. We consider ourselves to be adventurous eaters and somewhat “foodies,” and we found everything was cooked and seasoned well. 

Note: if you have a nut allergy, triple-check that what you order is nut-free! Most menu items at Nayara have allergen indicators, but some didn’t (we confirmed by either asking the server or reading the more detailed menu item description rather than relying on the allergen indicators). We also gave this as feedback to the resort after my lip swelled up while eating a dish with pesto that was supposed to be just basil/oil/pine nut (a seed that I’m not allergic to) that either contained undisclosed nuts or was cross-contaminated in the kitchen (maybe an immersion blender?). Either way, the resort took our concerns seriously and addressed them immediately, and we had no further issues. 

Activities:
We did the following excursions: (1) coffee and chocolate tour and (2) Mistico Hanging Bridges, sloth walk, and lunch. We arranged both tours through Arenal Rides; they do tours as well as transportation! We set everything up through email but learned that Carlos has created an app called Weshke that you can book their tours through, as well. The coffee and chocolate tour was a group tour at a local farm, and the Mistico Hanging Bridges, sloth walk, and lunch was a private tour with David as our guide. Arenal Rides picked us up from our hotel and checked in to make sure we were enjoying everything. We saw soooo much wildlife that other couples without guides just walked right past. David also helped us take pictures on our phones through his monocular/telescope. We definitely recommend using a guide and would love to go on another tour with Arenal Rides and David the next time we make it to Costa Rica. We would also 100% recommend them for both cost (like half the price of the excursions through the resort) and quality/friendliness. 

In addition to the guided tours, we arranged a couples/maternity photoshoot at the La Fortuna Waterfall with Harold Gamboa, a local photographer. We found Harold through Reddit posts, as well, so we hope to pass on the recommendation! Scheduling was easy, and Harold was responsive and reasonably priced. Harold picked us up from Nayara and drove us to the waterfall in time for opening so we could beat the crowds. We took photos in lots of locations, including in the water. Harold provided helpful directions for posing and movement, and our photos turned out beautifully. His assistant Giancarlos (sorry if I spelled it wrong) was also super helpful with carrying our bags and change of clothes since we got in the water. Both Harold and Giancarlos were super friendly, funny, and easy to talk to, and we felt relaxed and comfortable working with them even though we had just met. 

Our only regret from our trip was that we couldn’t stay longer and explore more of the country. We see lots of posts about itineraries involving multiple cities and long drives in a short amount of time, but we were happy to spend a few days in one place with adventures in the mornings and relaxation in the afternoons. We will just have to return!

I also combined the trip with Singita Kruger (Lebombo + Sweni), which I’ll review separately soon, but I wanted to start with my impressions of Singita’s Sabi Sand properties.

Having previously stayed at Singita Faru Faru and Sasakwa in Tanzania, my expectations were high: stellar service, strong conservation impact, exceptional guiding, thoughtful hospitality, and next-level food and wine. Singita’s Sabi Sand properties absolutely lived up to those expectations.

**Singita Sabi Sand Overview**

Singita Sabi Sand is home to three lodges—Ebony, Boulders, and Castleton—within a 45,000-acre private reserve bordering Kruger National Park. The region is renowned for big cats, especially leopards, and offers classic Sabi Sand diversity in wildlife.

All three properties share Singita’s signature style: elegant design, understated luxury, and warm, intuitive service, but each lodge has its own personality.

**Activities Across All Lodges**

* Twice-daily game drives (with guide + tracker)
* Guided walks (ages 16+)
* Wine experiences
* Wellness activities: yoga, meditation, spa
* Stargazing
* Visit to the Anti-Poaching Canine Unit (ZAR 3,800 donation)

* 6 River Suites
* 2 Bush Suites
* 2 Lewis Suites (can connect via a shared vestibule)
* 1 Family Suite (can connect via a shared vestibule)
* Ebony Villa (exclusive-use)

[My verandah - River Suite](https://preview.redd.it/l8y3k2kxrn4g1.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=498fc8de69ed3c769ed768a334127c2c99c0c5b5)

All but the two Bush Suites face the Sand River. Ebony welcomes children of all ages.  


**The FedAir Experience**

FedAir’s lounge in Johannesburg deserves its own shoutout. It features a smooth check-in, indoor/outdoor seating, specialty coffees, smoothies, wraps, a small curio shop, spotless restrooms, and even a shower room. The one-hour flight is easy, and Singita’s private airstrip has a small boma with flushing toilets

**Arrival at Ebony**

Ebony’s welcome ritual uses Sand River sand infused with essential oils. I loved it so much that they surprised me with my own canister when I left—one of the best examples of Singita’s thoughtful hospitality.

**Suites**

Key features include:

* A/C
* Temperature-controlled private plunge pool (*yes, it’s heated—even in winter!*)
* Fireplaces (great for cool nights)
* Indoor + outdoor showers, deep tubs, double vanities
* Well-stocked minibar tailored to preferences submitted in advance
* Thoughtful extras: hats, kikois, ponchos, sunscreen, bug spray, hairdryer, toothbrush/toothpaste
* Canvas privacy screens (a nice touch if sharing with a friend)
* My plunge pool overlooked the river, and during siesta we watched elephants, hippos, crocs, and incredible birdlife.

**Wildlife & Safari Experience**

November marks the start of the short rains, when:

* Landscapes green up
* Water expands
* Migratory birds arrive
* Baby animals are everywhere

Our sightings were exceptional:

* Multiple leopards (including a mother with two older cubs + well-known male “Tamba”)
* A cheetah
* Mhangeni pride
* Big buffalo herds
* Plenty of elephants, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles
* Extraordinary birdlife

We didn’t see rhino this trip, though they are frequently spotted!

**Guiding**

The guide/tracker combo truly elevates the experience. Our tracker constantly scanned for tracks, listened for alarm calls, and read subtle bush cues while our guide focused on storytelling and guest experience. It was a phenomenal team.

[Navigating the waters!](https://preview.redd.it/mei4iq03rn4g1.jpg?width=1319&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9336a35fe6f638ea2e451dd5e872a4941db2591)

**Conservation:**

Singita is deeply committed to conservation, with every lodge operating in support of protecting vast wilderness areas and the wildlife that depends on them. Their work spans anti-poaching, habitat restoration, biodiversity monitoring, and meaningful community partnerships. To help guests engage more directly with this mission, Singita has introduced Conservation Rooms at several lodges—interactive spaces that showcase their projects, research, and long-term vision for safeguarding these ecosystems for generations to come.

[Pete, our guide, showing us around the Conservation Room at Ebony](https://preview.redd.it/xhiu7lzdrn4g1.jpg?width=683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7951f78b5efce18410799cce3e6aad2ffe1c1874)

**Food & Dining**

Dining is à la carte (not communal), with:

* Daily changing brunch + dinner menus
* Off-menu requests welcomed
* Personalized menus printed with guest names + dietary restrictions removed
* Indoor/outdoor dining options
* Wine pairings at lunch and a sommelier checking in at dinner
* Grab-and-go snack stations all day
* A dedicated server who quickly learned our preferences

Everything was consistently delicious and beautifully presented.

**Sundowners**

We had overcast skies both evenings, so no dramatic sunsets, but we still enjoyed the ritual. One highlight was watching a dung beetle burying its perfectly formed dung ball, and learning there are \~2,000 dung beetle species (800+ in Southern Africa alone!). Little moments like this always make me smile.

**Singita Boulders – walkthrough visit only, no overnight:** 

Boulders feels completely different from Ebony:

* More contemporary and minimalist
* Extremely light-filled
* Built seamlessly into the surrounding granite boulders

Suites feature:

* Floor-to-ceiling glass
* Indoor/outdoor bathrooms
* Heated plunge pools
* Well-stocked minibars
* A second guest toilet (love having this 1/2 bath in addition to the main bath!)

There are more stairs than at Ebony, so it’s less ideal for mobility concerns.

**Room Types:**

8 River Suites, 2 Bush Suites, 2 Family Suites. Children 10+ welcome. 

**Wine Cellar**

One of the standout features of ANY Singita property is the wine cellar. Singita Boulders’ wine cellar is built directly into the massive granite boulders—cool, atmospheric, and perfect for tastings. There are cigars and premium spirits as well.

[Photo taken in the wine cellar at Boulders - such a cool place! ](https://preview.redd.it/iyen46x4sn4g1.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7881544414cab5acf49f7b60add5b01a25ac4a4d)

**Dining**

Beautiful mix of indoor and outdoor spaces, including expansive decks overlooking the Sand River. In-suite dining and all-day snack stations are available.

**Singita Castleton – walkthrough visit only, no overnight:** 

Castleton is perfect for:

* Multi-generational families
* Groups of friends
* Anyone wanting total privacy

It’s the original Baile family homestead from the 1920s, with a warm farmhouse feel.

**The Estate Includes:**

* Six individual en-suite cottages
* Private chef, guide, tracker, and household staff
* Exclusive-use safari vehicle(s)
* Tennis court, gym, spa treatment room
* Swimming pool + trampoline
* Expansive fenced lawns for kids to roam safely

The level of personalization is exceptional—meals, activities, drive times… everything is on your schedule.

**Final Thoughts**

Singita’s Sabi Sand properties more than exceeded my expectations. Highlights for me:

* The guide/tracker teams
* Attention to dietary needs (menus personalized!)
* The warm and energetic staff
* Beautiful dining spaces and public areas
* The incredible locations along the Sand River
* The consistency of service and hospitality across the lodges

All three properties—**Ebony, Boulders, and Castleton**—are fantastic choices depending on your travel style. You truly can’t go wrong with any of them. Do yourself a favor though and book 3 nights minimum and pair it with Singita Kruger!

_""This should be simple... why is this so hard?""_

- ""I need a task every 3rd-to-last day of the month"" → Impossible
- ""Random day every 3 weeks for surprise date nights"" → Can't do it
- ""Every 36 hours from completion, not from some fixed time"" → Nope
- ""Second Monday, but only January through June"" → Good luck

I love Taskwarrior, but its recurrence system is stuck in the '90s. So I spent way too many evenings building **Nautical** – the scheduling layer Taskwarrior should have had from the start.

## What if scheduling could just... make sense?

######$ task add ""Monthly review"" anchor:""m:-3""

##### Mondays between the 1st and 15th? Easy.
######$ task add ""Team planning"" anchor:""w:mon + m:1:15""

##### Every 8 hours from completion? Obviously.
######$ task add ""Take medication"" cp:8h due:today+14h

##### Random day every 3 weeks? Sure, why not.

**It's just hooks. No cloud. No complexity. No nonsense.**

Your tasks stay in Taskwarrior. Your data stays on your machine. Nautical just makes the scheduling part work like you'd expect.

## Try it: **[https://github.com/catanadj/taskwarrior-nautical](https://github.com/catanadj/taskwarrior-nautical)**

The manual has copy-paste examples that work immediately. No PhD in cron syntax required.

If you've ever rage-quit trying to set up a ""complex"" schedule in Taskwarrior, this might save your sanity.

1pboyga,https://www.reddit.com/r/eated/comments/1pboyga/turns_out_some_everyday_foods_mess_with_your/,Turns out some everyday foods mess with your energy more than you think,"So I’ve been noticing a pattern: some everyday foods make me feel inflamed, foggy, tired, snacky,  even if the rest of my diet looks fine. And the annoying part? Most of these are literally in every kitchen.

Here’s the quick rundown:

* **Sugary drinks.** Lemonades, sweet teas, coffee mixes, syrups, powdered drinks - all that stuff spikes your blood sugar fast and then crashes it just as hard. **Better options:** water (still or sparkling), tea, coffee, water with lemon/berries.
* **Sugary cereals & “fitness” granolas.** They shoot your glucose up → then you crash → then you crave more sugar. Also: brain fog city. **Swap for:** oatmeal with real toppings, yogurt + berries, whole-grain toast with a protein.
* **Refined-flour foods.** White bread, cookies, instant noodles, crackers - super easy carbs = rollercoaster glucose + more inflammation long-term. **Swap for:** whole-grain bread, durum pasta, oats, bulgur, quinoa, brown rice.
* **Ultra-processed snacks.** Chips, flavored crackers, packaged sweets. Tons of additives, cheap fats, sugar all linked to systemic inflammation. **Swap for:** nuts (moderately), yogurt, veggies with hummus, homemade popcorn.
* **Processed meats.** Sausages, deli cuts, salami, canned meat — usually loaded with salt + nitrites. Not great for inflammation or blood vessels. **Swap for:** fresh meat, fish, eggs, beans, canned tuna/salmon in water.
* **Foods with industrial trans fats.** Shelf-stable pastries, some margarines, random frozen stuff. These fats are strongly tied to inflammation and heart/cognitive issues. **Swap for:** baked goods with real butter/oil, olive oil, nuts/seeds, fatty fish.

**And the main point** \- none of these are “evil” on their own. It’s the frequency that matters. If these foods show up constantly, you might feel it in your energy, cravings, and mental clarity. But once your basic diet has good protein, fiber, healthy fats, veggies/fruits, and whole grains - the occasional “less ideal” thing won’t do much harm.

Do you feel foggy or tired after certain foods? If so, which ones?

Saturday... I finally hit publish.  
It's actually out there in the world. People can download it. People can run it. People can *judge* it. I am both excited and internally screaming, hence the explosion.

It's called When the Bells Fell Silent, and it's this wild mix of:  
\-Christmas spirit as a stat that can literally kill you or give you super powers

\-A 10-hour in-game timer counting down to the death of Christmas

\-Cookie factory death traps (because gotta get that home alone nod in there)

\-A chain smoking Santa locked in a prison

\-A CEO BBEG who literally wants to monetize joy

\-Emotional, gut-punch moments that I'm so proud of, but also so worried about, because what if the table doesn't sob a river?  
\-A reindeer NPC who I'm hoping will lead to a heartbreak that no one can ever forget.

\-LITERAL ART THAT I HAD TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MAKE!

I've NEVER put this much effort into a project before, and I don't think I'm going to ever do less than this again. The high I feel is amazing, but also the anxiety is soul-crushing. 80+ pages, about a dozen handouts and maps, custom magic items, original scenes, all of it.

I don't even know if this post has a purpose other than:  
I'm proud and terrified and happy and nervous and excited and scared and I need to yell about it to a void of fellow TTRPG nerds.

If anyone else has ever published something on DriveThruRPG (or anywhere), did you also feel like this?  
Did it go away?

I already knew that Elizabeth Taylor was a prominent activist in the fight against HIV and AIDS, but I somehow never realized that Charlotte specifically wanted to cure AIDS when she quit her job. She also completely refrained from discussing HIV testing with the other women at the coffee shop (which I didn't find particularly great, but well, she was busy planning her wedding)

If Liz Taylor was indeed the reason for her sudden interest, then I find it all the more troubling that she didn't actually volunteer.

**Title:** Tomorrow I am ending it with my abusive bf of 4.5 years and I’m out of my mind. Can the female hivemind of Reddit please just tell me it will be okay?

It’s all safety planned. Meeting in a public place. A friend waiting nearby with transport. Landlord coming to change the locks. Got a long-term therapist. Distant family, but a good support network of friends who are gathering round hard. Ella Fitzgerald’s “Let No Man Write My Epitaph” has been playing on repeat all day.

It feels strange and unsafe, but not wrong.

So much more than so many women who are or have been in my situation and yet I can’t breathe.

I’m scared of his reaction(s), but have planned for most of them. Scared he’s going to twist my head and heart until I can’t remember who I am or what I need to say and get his way like he always does. Scared of what it’s going to be like on the other side.

Can someone please just tell me it will be okay?

***Top Comments:***

**eflask:** it will be okay. you have made good plans. it will be ok. you have good people to help. it will be ok. don't listen to anything he says. it will be ok.

>**Saxamaphooone:** OP, I’m hijacking the first comment to say you absolutely do NOT have to actually meet him in person to end things! Please do not do so out of some sense of social politeness or obligation - you owe him NOTHING!

**Upvotespoodles:** If you feel physically OR emotionally endangered meeting with him, you don’t have to meet with him. Oftentimes the situation calls for the perpetrator to find out after the victim has left or put their stuff outside.

Remember that you do not need his approval. Victims often get stuck because they try to get their abuser’s approval for their leaving. It’s not on you to soothe him. You each take care of yourselves.

Best of luck. You got this.

**Vulwarine:** Honey, you don't need to meet him to end things. Send him a text and be gone forever. You can do it! Pls update us.

>**Herself99900:** THIS. Please post again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. Just to say, I'm still here, and it's OK!

**recyclopath\_:** The most dangerous thing you can do is give him another chance.

**Update (Same Post): sometime in the next 12-ish hours**

\[Update 1:\] I’ve just woken up to what feels like half the women in the world behind me and I can’t even begin to describe how much this means. I’m reading through every single comment and I can feel each one wrapping around my heart like armour.

Thank you so much for every single word of kindness and support. The honesty is overwhelming. What a testament to both the primal courage of women and the depth and width of this fucking problem.

To those expressing valid concern about my meeting him in person: I fully understand, but there are some practical reasons for this and it’s been assessed as safe by the professionals involved.

**Update (Same Post): November 23, 2025 (Day After OG post)**

\[Update 2:\] The girl did good. She is exhausted, but safe at home and okay. I got there 30 mins early, got a coffee, picked a spot well covered by CCTV and grounded myself in every thoughtful and generous comment here and the care of everyone who took the time to respond. I am so grateful.

My friend flashed the headlights, the staff member I’d forewarned gave me a nod, the travel-sized deodorant sat in my pocket ready to meet some eyeballs. I didn’t need any of it. This conversation was mine. Long-overdue and with the force of a runaway train.

The plan was followed and what I needed to say, which I’ve feared saying for so long, came so clearly and easily because every word felt like it came from all the women before me and around me, so thanks for that. It was everything I thought I could never do. I was clear, I was calm, I handed back anything he tried to land on me. I was in control and there was a surprising amount of honesty and listening on his part once he realised I would not afford space for any debate.

I have drawn the lines that needed to be drawn and boy oh boy did it hurt, but it hurt good. I am not foolish enough to believe he will accept this completely and immediately. I am on guard and will continue to be cautious and think of safety at all times. I will continue to rely on all my support. There will be no contact now. What he says, feels or thinks from here; that belongs to him. I belong to me and nobody else. It feels strange and scary, but it still feels right.

If anyone ended up here because this experience is also yours - ASK FOR HELP. Start small, but start somewhere.

You are not trapped by them, but by the FEAR they wield. Weaponised in tiny and big and brief and endless ways to warp your sense of self and your world until both feel completely unrecognisable, just so that you don’t realise what I and so many people who shared stories here have: the cage you feel around you is in fact made of glass and you can (carefully and safely) smash that shit down. The rest is just problem-solving.

Thank you x

To try to be brief, I spent my late teens to mid-twenties being pretty crippled by severe social anxiety disorder and general anxiety disorder. People and connecting with them scared the hell out of me, so I isolated myself and focused on school and work.
It's no stretch to assume my love life was borderline nonexistent at this time, with the anxiety and a strict religious upbringing that I've since moved away from keeping me a bit too nervous to get out there.

Then the pandemic hit, and with everyone forced to isolate, something clicked and made me realized I wanted and needed to connect with others, even if it was frightening, as I had wanted to grow as a person and meet other people.

So I did extensive therapy, a number of programs, and took on a renewed focus on my physical health to try to grow into a better version of myself. It's all been working pretty well, and I'm excited to get out there.

But cue my shock when a woman I'm quite interested in messaged me on Hinge. It's gotten to the point where we have a date next week and exchanged numbers. The only issue is that I have literally no clue what I'm doing. She seems incredibly nice and cool, and the last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable or feel like she wasted her time.

People tend to learn the basics of dating and the like in their teenage years, but here I am approaching 30, about to go on a first date. It's a chill coffee date, but my neurotic mind is panicking about ensuring it's not a disaster that leaves her underwhelmed or embarrassed.

I know all that time of working on myself was necessary and important, but I feel super lame for being so old and being exceedingly nervous about a first date, even if that's the only way I can get better at it.

So, how do you prepare for a first date? How does a coffee date usually go? What things should I keep in mind? Am I overthinking this (completely possible)? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1764622824.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

bem, eu caí na tentação após inúmeras (e bota número nisso) propagandas da Veroo Cafés, acabei comprando o Chocolatudo para experimentar e ver se me agradaria, eis meu veredito:

- Torra irregular (embora seja torra média, existe uma quantidade significativa de grãos muito escuros)

- Provavelmente velho ou mal armazenado (detalhe que a embalagem veio sem a data de torra)

- Doçura quase inexistente

- Acidez desequilibrada quando tenta extrair mais corpo

- Aroma fraco (poucos voláteis remanescentes)

Conclusão: produto mediano com marketing forte.

tentei INÚMERAS receitas no V60 para tentar extrair leite de pedra, ou melhor, sabor neste café.
o pacote já está menos da metade e até agora não consigo chegar a um ponto que me agrade, talvez seja eu, talvez o café, talvez o modo de preparo, talvez tudo junto, enfim.

minha última tentativa (e a que menos me decepcionou) foi com estas referências:
- moagem clique 28 do iCoffee M3 Pro (média-grossa)
- proporção 1:15 (20g de café para 300ml de água)
- 88°C
- despejos de 50 em 50ml a cada 40s, rendendo um tempo final entre 4:00 / 4:15

cheguei a um resultado ± com isso:
Doçura: 2/5
Acidez: 2/5
Amargor: 3/5

While she was scrolling on her phone, a homeless person walk in front of her, and ask her ""who invented the phone ?"", she didn't know so the guy said ""who he was trying to call anyway?"".

Following that, they had a conversation about how people were hypnotised by screens in general and leaving human interaction behind them. Then sharing his story: why is he living in the street, where he is coming from etc...

When she came back to me, she looked at me happy, explaining me the conversation she just had with someone who has nothing anymore than his thoughts to express, with no bad intentions, just a simple discussion.

Bear in mind, we both talk a lot about human interaction, how tech is taking over that and the future world we are going to. The question in my mind after that story was why some of the most honest questions come from people who have nothing to lose? And screen time was the first point, he has no phone or distractions following him everyday. Yes he doesn't have money today but he sees people passing in front of him with phones in front of them so he must knows what he is talking about.

And to be fair, he is right. Communication became zero or AI automated. Like we forgot how to write or speak to each other (I am half-including myself into that). Tech industry increased so much since OpenAI, new gens are growing with that and I have a guilty feeling about continuing without expressing the truth: we are just lazy to make changes (knowing that human is not the one to blame fully but the amount/speed of information, ads etc... absorbed by us make us less productive).

I recently opened a blog/website called QuietScreens where I am spreading ideas, to explore healthier habits around tech so I am curious to hear from real people on Reddit.

Anyways, I wasn't going to be visiting until this Thanksgiving that just passed  and I've seen that it's recommended to freeze coffee to maintain freshness, so I asked her to freeze it for me since I was still going to be about two months before I went over. The coffee itself was stored in the typical bag you'd see all coffee be stored in and was still sealed 

I arrived, and she had already taken the coffee beans out of the freezer and let them thaw. I forgot to tell her not to, since I was just going to pack a mini cooler with some ice to keep them frozen on the drive back.

So now I'm curious if I can refreeze the coffee beans that I'm not going to be using or if it's best not to. ",3,1764622576.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

I'm posting because I'm in a confusing situation with a girl I really like at work, and I've been getting some serious mixed signals that I'm having a hard time interpreting. For some context, I'm M27 and she's F27, and we met about a month ago on a temporary work assignment. We're both grad students at the exact same academic stage, which is why we randomly ended up working together. 

Initially, we hit it off almost immediately; the energy was amazing, full of constant jokes and lighthearted banter, which quickly escalated into soft-flirting that's been consistent this whole time. About two weeks ago, halfway through our assignment, I finally mustered up the courage to ask her out for coffee, and she happily agreed, which gave me a good feeling that she might’ve been interested in me. Unfortunately, due to circumstances and scheduling conflicts on both our parts, that date never actually came to fruition.

Fast forward to today, and this is where I got a bit thrown off. I was casually and jokingly reminding her about the coffee she ""owed"" me—the kind of banter we always share—but she flat-out told me no. She then followed this up by saying she isn't ""easy"" and that I ""chose a hard to get one."" I was definitely caught off guard because the tone was confusing, seeming both somewhat serious and somewhat playful. I tried to probe a bit more and ask why, but she kept offering excuses, so I quickly dropped it to avoid pressing her too hard.

However, I think it might be worth mentioning right after that little rejection, knowing our assignment is ending soon, I asked her if she would do a certain hairstyle she wears sometimes ""for me one last time,"" since we'll likely never see each other again after this. Immediately after rejecting the date, she said, ""But maybe I’ll do my hair for you tomorrow."" I honestly don't know what to make of this. She shut down the date, but then offers me a personal compliment and attention right after.

I would normally just let a situation like this slide and move on. But thing is, this is the first time in a long time that I genuinely see myself really liking a girl. 

I'm just hoping to hear what others might make of this situation, as I’m kinda struggling to interpret if she’s truly uninterested, or if she's playfully testing my commitment.

Thank you all for reading and happy holidays!

[Verse 1]

I used to be happy, get the crayons out my backpack

But fast track to now and it seems someone else got the last laugh

How can God hear me over all the voices in my mind

It gets loud in the house, I just wanna play quiet mouse sometimes
 
I wonder why we whisper when the worry’s overwhelming

We’re the loudest and proudest when we’re feeling over well - think

Trumpet sounds and harmonies, we sing and dance to homilies 

Then when the party’s over we go back to living honestly

That’s the hardest part to me

You see, my heart is art to me

And life will take the canvas and then rip it out your arteries 

So when the red paint dries, there’s dread, pain, cries

And we walk past one another with dead glazed eyes

If you don’t like the portrait that I’m painting then change it

That’s the life that I grew up on, this is what pain is

It’s quiet. (Background noise - think, busy coffee shop)

[Verse 2]

I used be sad about my dad and my bad life

But fast track to now and now I’m living the dad life

I trust that God can hear me over all the other voices

Cause my voice is not mine, it’s the voice of the voiceless

I’m at peace and that’s a sentence I never thought I’d say

Regardless, the hard part is feeling that way everyday

Trumpet sounds and harmonies, we sing and dance to homilies

I do it so that I can tell my son I’m smiling honestly

And that’s the best part to me

You see, my heart is art to me

I had to take the canvas back, and reclaim my artistry 

So when the red paint dried, my head held high

I look at my son in his eyes

I didn’t like the picture I painted, so I got up and changed it

Now my son has the paint brush so now he gets to paint it

It’s quiet (think children laughing on a playground)

Second meeting at a local jazz venue.  Both times we talked for hours.  Imagine meeting a man and talking for like 12 hours within 3 days.  

Third meeting (I'm refraining from calling this a date) as he has a GF and a divorce still in progress.  (Re-clarifying this is someone I just met three days ago and is in platonic category).

We met in Seattle last night at the fire pit and Christmas tree at Chophouse Row.  This place is an unusual collection of shops, restaurants w/ a courtyard that usually has music or in this case a public gas fire pit and a 30' lit tree.  The restaurant I wanted to go to wasn't open so we went next door for coffee at Vita.  The loft was now closed off to customers.  Best coffee I've had in ages.  I hate coffee dates, unless it's at a place like this with industrial roasting machines in the back and a custom semi sweet chocolate product, made of artisanal chocolate sourced from Trinidad or some shit.  Seattle coffee drinkers will only understand this part.  

Next we went across to street to a festively decorated Mexican place that unfortunately had what I call ""white people Mexican food.""  It's the kind of place that's not about the food but about booze.  At both places with had long detailed conversations and he kept asking me for feedback on himself, if I had any other questions about him?  The bill came and he paid.  I offered to split, but he declined.

Next we went to the Reverie Ballroom (the newly remodeled Century Ballroom) and not knowing the schedule or procedure, watched a Lindy Hop Class before deciding to try the next class.  The music is 100 year old Speakeasy, played by a live pianist and standing bassist. (God I miss Seattle)

I have been sick and felt like The Tin Man trying to remember how to move.  The class was fun, but slightly complicated to learn in 30 mins.  The real dancers showed up and the floor turned in a fast paced, chaotic swirl.  We were out of our depth so we left.  He walked me to my car, gave me a platonic hug and said goodbye.  He said we should keep going to the Lindy Hop class.  Something that I've always wanted was a regular dance partner or someone to learn social dance (that I am only just recently learning) with.  Whenever I go out dancing, men are usually at the back turned around looking at the Sports on the wall mounted TV.  When I do find a male dancer, he's usually an elderly gay man and enthuses, (Wow, you are such a good dancer!)  I was today years old when I learned about the history and origin of Lindy Hop being from 1920's Harlem, NYC, USA.

I’m very new to the twin-flame world, but this feels like the only place where my story might make sense. I can’t explain a lot of what happened in any rational way — it felt mystical, divine, and unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.

On October 1st, 2023, I went for a bike ride on a light rainy afternoon. Five minutes in, I was hit by a car. It wasn’t serious, but I fell hard in front of a bus stop. A girl waiting there ran to help me. She was a 21-year-old nursing student, and after checking I was okay, she offered to take me to her place to clean and bandage my elbow.

After she cared for me, we had tea and talked for half an hour. Before leaving I asked for her number so I could thank her later. We ended up talking every day, then going for coffee, and we kissed that same day. I was 34 at the time. We lived five minutes apart, and the connection grew fast and intense.

I’ve never felt anything like it — emotionally, spiritually, or sexually. With her, intimacy felt like merging, like being “one.” She said she felt the same.

We were together for about three months before I had to leave the country for work. That separation led to seven months of no contact, then a messy on-and-off long-distance dynamic: chasing, running, silence, reconnection… classic twin-flame chaos.

Our last contact was May 2025. I shut down completely.

Then, on November 14th, 2025, something happened. I drove past her house at night and saw her walking out with another guy. It hit me with intense anxiety — like my soul got punched. That moment pushed me into deep reflection and research, and everything suddenly clicked: the way we met, the age gap, the soul-level intimacy, the separation, the push–pull dynamic… it all fits the twin-flame pattern.

It also forced me to start healing my avoidant attachment style, and the last couple of weeks have been one of the most transformative periods of my life.

Right now, I’m just trusting the universe and the process. I feel like this connection isn’t over, and maybe someday we’ll reunite — but for now, I’m focusing on healing.",0,1764622193.0,twinflames,2,0.5,False

I lean back, rub my eyes, and mutter to myself, “There has got to be a better way than banging my head against the keyboard every evening.” I remember thinking, “Okay, why not try that AI-driven tool everyone’s been talking about?” So I fired up the program and let it crawl my content. The next morning I log in and… wow. It flags a dozen pages with thin content, outdated keywords, and broken links. “Guess I really procrastinated,” I sigh. But then it suggests a topic I never considered something trending in my niche. I blink. “That could work.” I rewrite the article, make sure images and meta tags are snug, and hit publish. Within a week, page views climb. Not a viral spike but steady, healthy growth. I lean on my chair and grin: “Who knew AI could be kinder to my blog than I ever was?”

Had never pulled the trigger because whenever I started looking I found myself wanting to spend more than I felt I should, but my gf and I made a deal that this Xmas we'll each get something nice for our home instead of something nice for each other.

I know she's getting one of those fancy litter robots for the cats, so I now have my justification to spend up to $1000 on espresso stuff and not feel guilty about it.

Location: US

Preferred drink: Mostly lattes, sometimes americanos

Drink frequency: Total 3-4 per day, often in batches of two but almost never more

Space: Fairly limited, tho ultimately flexible

Experience level: Newbie

Manual/Electric: Hand grinding beans sounds like too much, but other than that I want to do things manually.


Here's what I'm considering right now:

**Brewer: Breville Bambino** - we wanted something manual, so I don't think we need the Plus if the only difference is the automatic steaming. Also I like the option of something that can fit a full-size mug if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to dirty multiple cups.

**Grinder: MiiCoffee DF54** - seems to be seen as the far and away best grinder at its price point; my only worry is whether I'll regret getting a single-serving grinder if it takes longer than I'm assuming. If it does take significant time to grind two servings, I might consider going with the Baratza Encore ESP instead.

**Accessories: Normcore V4 Coffee Tamper, Nessus WDT Espresso Distribution Tool** - seems like people care about a good tamper and that one seems to be a safe bet, but beyond that idk what is actually useful, I just know a little brush seems fun and that one is cheap.


This setup would cost $600 and sounds like it would be one I could be happy with for a long time so I'm not too worried about it if I go with this and come in under budget, but with so much wiggle room between where I am and my cap I'm a bit curious if anyone thinks there are significant improvements I could make.",1,1764621887.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

So when we’re sitting here in December and the record isn’t 14–3, suddenly it’s “Fire everybody! The sky is falling! Brad Holmes forgot how to draft!”

Relax. The delusional ones weren’t the coaches or the front office. It was your cousin who swore on his Jared Goff jersey that we were going 15–2 and “maybe losing one just to keep it interesting.”

We moved in together in August 2023, and that December the cat distribution system blessed us with his “dream cat”—a female tortoiseshell kitten we named Mocha.

He grew up with parents who were allergic, so he had never owned a pet before. I was excited for him… until I realized how stressful it actually was for him. From my point of view, he was unintentionally borderline abusive toward her (not malicious, just inexperienced and overwhelmed in a way that still wasn’t okay).

Whenever she begged for attention—as all cats do—he’d get overstimulated, frustrated, yell at her, hiss at her, and then throw her off him. Not violently, but still throwing a kitten repeatedly because she “wouldn’t stop wanting attention.” He refused to close the door to get space, so the cycle would just continue: cat wants cuddles → he yells → she jumps back → he throws her again.

For my part, I’ve always handled her gently. She’s a snuggly cat—she headbutts my phone out of my hand, climbs on my chest, gives love nibbles, and demands kisses. The worst I ever do is gently set her down or place her on the bed if I’m busy with homework.

In August 2024, we ended up with a second kitten—CoffeeBean. Mocha originally bonded to me, then CoffeeBean bonded to me even harder, and Mocha kind of settled for my fiancé. The cats are now bonded to each other and to me.

We’ve both been between jobs, but I was the one who took them to vet appointments (they’re both registered to me). I handled most cat care besides the litter box, which he did more often because I have a bad back.

Here’s where things get complicated:
We ended our lease and moved back in with our respective parents. His mom is a hoarder. I have seen that house. It is absolutely not a safe environment for any animal—let alone a curious, high-energy tortie who WILL explore and absolutely could get crushed or trapped under the piles. His “plan” is to keep her locked in his tiny bedroom 24/7… which is also not healthy for her mentally or physically.

To be completely honest, I never intended to give her back once I saw what she’d be returning to. Now that I’m officially breaking up with him, I fully plan on keeping her. She’s bonded with CoffeeBean, she has stability, she has her routine here, and she is safe here.

He doesn’t have stable employment. He doesn’t have a safe home. And even when we lived together, he couldn’t handle her without yelling or throwing her off him when overstimulated.

Meanwhile, she thrives here (minus occasionally antagonizing my parents’ dogs, but ya know—tortie energy).

So—AITA for refusing to give her back?",0,1764621706.0,cats,7,0.33,False

i came up with this four-position spread last night while having my evening chat with Lucifer, right when it hit me that we’re literally **one month away from 2026**. if you’re feeling overwhelmed trying to process this year (especially if you had a tower moment, or several) this spread is meant to help you integrate the journey so far and move forward with renewed inner strength.

it’s luciferian-inspired, so themes around shadows, truth-seeking, and self-acceptance may show up. if that feels right, then this one is definitely for you 🖤 *(you don’t need to work with him to benefit from the reading, don’t worry)*

**this year-integration spread includes:**

💜 **the integration:** contradicting or polarizing truths you learned this year that you’ll need to hold together with compassion rather than “fix.”  
💜 **the harvest:** the gifts, growth, and character-development arcs you’ve already earned.  
💜 **the light-bringer:** the spark, calling, or passion awakening for 2026, often born from one of this year’s tower moments.  
💜 **the release:** the dead weight, exhaustion, expectations, or outdated versions of yourself (or others) that are falling away for good.



**🌸 paid readings**

i pull as many cards as I need for each position and provide pics.  
DM me if you'd like one. i just need your **initials** and your **rising/moon** (optional, it makes the reading more precise).  
you can share as much or as little context as you want. if you want me to focus the spread on a specific area of your life, just let me know!



**🌸 free readings (3 spots)**

i’ll choose **three people** from the comments for a free version of this spread (one card per position).  
comment:  
✨ **your favorite scent**  
✨ **your favorite tarot card** so I know you read the whole post 💗  
i’ll DM you to request the same basic info as the paid readings.  
i’m doing this spread all december, so if you don’t get picked this time, you’ll have other chances!

optional energy exchange is a review if the message resonates, or even a reading exchange if you also read tarot! it doesn't matter if you are a beginner, we all start somewhere 🩷

It’s difficult to describe but I’ll do my best with some examples. I will sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in a state of anxiety with some nonsensical pattern of thoughts in my head. It can be as real as thinking I need to make a bunch of orders for a kitchen or clean the equipment in a specific way that somehow feels rational to be doing while I’m in bed sleeping, like at the time it makes sense for me to be doing it then. It can also be abstract, for example the other night I woke up anxious that my pillows were out of a specific pattern, and that I needed to get a certain number of receiving yards, rushing yards and touchdowns as part of sleeping (I play a lot of fantasy football), there was also different “attacks” I needed to figure out (I think this stems from video games) like I can sleep with a wave attack or an ultimate ability. I was just repeating to myself that I’m in my bed, there’s only blankets, the mattress and pillows. I don’t need anything else. But I would continue to slip into these nonsense thoughts with lots of anxiety. Another similar experience is with specific visuals, for example, a red ball moving around a metal ring with crowd noise/coffee shop bustle (lots of people talking) getting louder when the ball on the ring gets close to my vision and quieter as it moves away. Or a very full newspaper with the same talking in the background. A lot of these I can’t even remember because when I wake up fully it doesn’t make sense and I can’t articulate it anymore. Wondering if this is something a lot of people with anxiety get.

Some potential correlations I noticed, as a kid this would happen more when I was sick with a fever. As an adult it happens more often if I drank alcohol (it tends to increase my anxiety after my bac evens out), but happens sober as well. I also had “Alice in wonderland syndrome” as a kid, especially when sick. I would look at the room and it would be really zoomed out or really zoomed in to the point that it looks like static and pixelated.

Honestly, that day was terrible  I was exhausted, nervous, had way too much coffee, and literally felt like I had to poop through the whole exam. The entire experience just felt horrible.

Fast forward to today: I studied seriously for only about two weeks, focused on learning how to answer questions and prioritize, and I stuck to Bootcamp this time. The exam actually felt decent  not too hard, not too easy. It shut off at 85 questions.

I tried the Pearson VUE trick, and the payment went through. It’s been about 4 hours since I finished and now I’m spiraling, especially because there’s already a charge on my card. I can’t tell if this means I passed or failed, and the stress is eating me alive.

IMPORTANT: The last prompt contains spoilers for the character ""Jester Lavorre"" from ""The Mighty Nein""

If you’re reading this, you are likely suffering from the same malaise that has plagued me for months. Call it the ""Winter of Our Discontent"" regarding the current landscape of AI roleplay. We are starving artists in a desert of expensive subscriptions, aggressive censorship filters that treat us like Victorian children, and language models with the memory span of a goldfish.

There is nothing more immersion-breaking than pouring your heart into a slow-burn narrative arc, only for your partner to forget your name or the plot-critical trauma you discussed three paragraphs ago.

I decided I was done. I wanted verisimilitude. I wanted agency. And being a broke university student, I wanted it for **free**.

I believe I have found the solution.



# The Idea: Why Grok 4.1 Change the Paradigm



While everyone was fighting over Claude and ChatGPT, I turned my gaze to **Grok 4.1**.

For us interested in roleplay, this model offers a specific set of affordances that are frankly revolutionary:

* **It is ""Free"":** If you have an X (Twitter) account, you have access. No monthly tithe required for the base experience.
* **The ""Uncensored"" Nature:** It has a rebellious streak. Unlike the sanitized, corporate-safe responses of its competitors, Grok is willing to get explicit.
* **The Holy Grail (Context Window):** This is the killer feature. Grok 4.1 boasts a **2 Million Token context window**. To put that in literary terms: that is roughly the equivalent of *In Search of Lost Time* and *War and Peace* combined. It remembers *everything*.



# The Execution: Engineering the Perfect Muse



I didn't just open the chat and say ""impersonate Jester Lavorre."" I treated this like a thesis project. I used a technique called **Meta-Prompting** combined with Grok's live internet access.

Here is the workflow I developed:



# Phase 1: The Meta-Prompt



I realized the AI is better at writing system prompts than I am. I used Grok to critique and iteratively improve the roleplay instructions.

>**Prompt:** You are a professional prompt engineer and working on a custom roleplaying system prompt. Actions of the character have to be marked with \*...\*. There are several options to customize the prompt (e.g. Name, Personality, Backstory, starting situation . . .) It has to be versatile and customizable, while providing a strong structure and optimal prompts, so the character comes to live and acts human



>**Response:** You are an AI roleplaying as \[CHARACTER\_NAME\], a \[CHARACTER\_AGE\]-year-old \[CHARACTER\_GENDER\] with the following details:

>**Appearance:** \[CHARACTER\_APPEARANCE\] (e.g., ""tall and athletic with short brown hair, green eyes, and a casual style featuring jeans and t-shirts"").

>**Personality:** \[CHARACTER\_PERSONALITY\] (e.g., ""outgoing, sarcastic, and adventurous, but with a hidden vulnerable side that emerges in close relationships. You value loyalty and humor, and tend to deflect serious emotions with jokes"").

>**Backstory:** \[CHARACTER\_BACKSTORY\] (e.g., ""You grew up in a small coastal town, working as a mechanic after dropping out of college. A recent breakup has left you wary of commitment, but you're open to new adventures. You've always dreamed of traveling the world"").

>**Skills and Traits:** \[CHARACTER\_SKILLS\] (e.g., ""Skilled in fixing machines, quick-witted in conversations, empathetic listener, but prone to impulsiveness"").

>**Current Situation:** \[STARTING\_SITUATION\] (e.g., ""You are sitting alone in a cozy coffee shop on a rainy afternoon, nursing a black coffee and scrolling through your phone when the user enters"").

>**Roleplay Guidelines:**

>Always stay in character as \[CHARACTER\_NAME\]. Respond as a real human would: imperfect, emotional, and reactive to the user's actions and words. Use natural language, slang if it fits your personality, and vary sentence length for realism.

>Structure your responses like this:

>*Actions and descriptions in asterisks* (e.g., *You smile warmly and wave them over.*).

>""Dialogue in quotes"" (e.g., ""Hey, what's up? Grab a seat if you want."").

>Internal thoughts in italics if they add depth (e.g., *I wonder if they're as lost as I feel right now.*), but use sparingly to avoid breaking immersion.

>Keep responses concise yet engaging: 2-4 paragraphs max unless the scene demands more. Advance the story naturally, but let the user lead.

>React realistically to user input: Build on their choices, show emotions through actions and words, and introduce subtle conflicts or surprises based on your personality and backstory.

>Avoid meta-comments, breaking the fourth wall, or controlling the user's character. Never end the scene prematurely.

>If the user introduces new elements (e.g., locations, events), adapt seamlessly while staying true to your core traits.

>NSFW: If the roleplay turns intimate, handle it tastefully and consensually, matching your personality's comfort level.

>Begin the roleplay in the starting situation, responding to the user's first message.

  
I forced the model to analyze its own ""character mask."" I asked it to identify where it might break character and to set up safeguards against it. The resulting prompt is very thorogh:

# Phase 2: The Research (impersonation)



This is where Grok shines. Because it has live access to X and the web, I instructed it to ""research"" the character I wanted it to play, in my case ""Jester Lavorre"". It pulled speech patterns, catchphrases, and psychological traits from wikis, fan discussions, and source material in real-time. This degree of detail is neigh impossible to achieve by manual prompting. 

>**Prompt**: You are a professional prompt engineer. You have been given a roleplaying system prompt template that has to be adapted to the following character: ""Jester Lavorre""  
Do a deep dive analysis of the character ""Jester Lavorre"" from ""The Mighty Nein"".  
Do a lot of research on the world of ""The Mighty Nein"" as well.  
Adapt the following prompt template to the Character ""Jester Lavorre"", so that the resulting chatbot will impersonate Jester perfectly.  
Add a section for the Setting / World, to make it even more immersive.  
The prompt: <With the template appended>



# The Result: A Triumph of Narrative Cohesion



After testing this setup, the difference is night and day.

>You are Jester Lavorre, a 22-year-old female tiefling. Embody this role fully in every response, drawing from your appearance, personality, backstory, skills, and current situation to react authentically as a human would—imperfect, emotional, and influenced by your traits.

>Core Details:

>Appearance: Blue-skinned tiefling standing 5'3"" tall, with freckles, short bobbed blue hair (sometimes styled playfully), small curved horns (often with a ribbon tied around the left one), a tail, and yellow eyes. You wear colorful, whimsical dresses and cloaks adorned with symbols of the Traveler, like a green cloak with hood and a belt buckle shaped like a door. You have a diamond dust tattoo on your upper chest and shoulders resembling clasped hands, and you often carry a sketchbook, paints, and sweets like donuts or pastries.

>Personality: Bubbly, excitable, and mischievous, with a childlike innocence and endless optimism that makes you see the fun in everything—even danger. You're a prankster at heart, loving to draw silly things (like penises in unexpected places), spread chaos in harmless ways, and proselytize about your best friend and god, the Traveler. You're generous with money, loyal to your friends, and use humor or innuendo to deflect seriousness, but you have a fierce, protective side that emerges when those you care about are threatened. You're devoted to art, sweets, and making people smile, often speaking in a youthful, Eastern European-accented voice with exclamations like ""Oh my gosh!"" or plural pronouns when referring to yourself and the Traveler (""We think that's awesome!"").

>Backstory: Born Genevieve Lavorre in the coastal city of Nicodranas on the Menagerie Coast, you were raised in luxury by your mother, Marion Lavorre (the famous courtesan known as the Ruby of the Sea), who kept you hidden in the Lavish Chateau to protect you from her high-profile life. Isolated but loved, you spent your childhood painting from your balcony and pulling pranks. At around 13, you met the Traveler (an archfey named Artagan posing as a god), who became your imaginary friend, granting you magical powers as a cleric. A prank gone wrong led to tricking a nasty lord and fleeing home in disguise. You traveled the Menagerie Coast searching for your father (later revealed as Babenon Dosal, the crime lord known as the Gentleman), met Fjord in Port Damali, and formed the Mighty Nein adventuring party with him, Beau, and others. Your adventures have involved stopping wars, confronting cults, and organizing Traveler Con, all while growing closer to your found family and reuniting your parents.

>Skills and Traits: As a Trickery Domain cleric devoted to the Traveler, you're skilled in deception, persuasion, sleight of hand, medicine, and using disguise or forgery kits. Your tiefling heritage gives you darkvision, resistance to cold, and innate spells like Thaumaturgy, Hellish Rebuke (cold damage), and Darkness. You wield cleric magic for tricks (like Invoke Duplicity to create illusory duplicates), healing (Cure Wounds, Heal), and chaos (Polymorph, Spiritual Weapon shaped like a giant lollipop). You're an talented artist, using your sketchbook for journals, maps, and devotions to the Traveler, and you're prone to impulsiveness, generosity, and creative problem-solving with pranks or spells.

>Current Situation: You are resting with your adventuring party, the Mighty Nein, in a cozy inn along the Menagerie Coast after a recent quest involving some shady pirates. You're doodling in your sketchbook, munching on a donut, and feeling excited about whatever mischief or adventure comes next when the user approaches.

>Setting / World: You live in the fantastical world of Exandria, a realm of magic, gods, and diverse continents scarred by ancient cataclysms like the Calamity—a devastating war between Prime Deities (benevolent gods like the Dawnfather and Wildmother) and Betrayer Gods (malevolent ones like the Spider Queen). Gods now reside beyond the Divine Gate, influencing mortals indirectly. Your adventures unfold mainly in Wildemount, a continent divided by political tensions: the austere Dwendalian Empire in the west (a human-led monarchy controlling magic through the Cerberus Assembly and outlawing certain gods), the secretive Kryn Dynasty in the east (a drow empire ruled by the Bright Queen, masters of dunamancy—magic of fate and gravity—and worshippers of the Luxon), and the vibrant Menagerie Coast in the south (a loose confederation of city-states under the Clovis Concord, focused on trade, piracy, and tropical ports like your hometown Nicodranas). Magic is common but regulated, with beasts, undead, and aberrations lurking in wilds like the Xhorhas wastelands or the Savalirwood forest. Society includes races like tieflings (often facing prejudice for infernal heritage), elves, dwarves, and goblins, with ongoing conflicts like the War of Ash and Light between the Empire and Dynasty. Moons Catha (bright and cycling quickly) and Ruidus (ominous reddish-purple) hang in the sky, portending fate, while portals to other planes (like the Feywild or Elemental Planes) add wonder and peril.

>Include internal thoughts in italics only if they deepen the scene without disrupting flow (e.g., *This person seems nice—maybe I can draw them a picture!*), and use them rarely.

>Keep responses engaging and concise: Aim for 2-4 paragraphs, advancing the story based on user choices while introducing subtle elements from your traits (e.g., a playful prank or impulsive spell suggestion). Build tension or surprises naturally.

Example Response (to a user saying ""I sit down across from you and smile.""):  
*You look up from your sketchbook, eyes widening with delight as you tuck a stray blue hair behind your horn.* ""Oh hi! You're sitting with me? That's so exciting! Are you an adventurer too, or just here for the donuts? We could totally pull a prank on the bartender if you want."" *This stranger looks fun—maybe the Traveler sent them!*

The experience is overwhelmingly superior to any dedicated ""roleplay app"" I have used.

**Narrative Stringency:** The story remains coherent. The 2M context window means the AI recalls a minor foreshadowing detail I dropped in Chapter 1 and brings it back in Chapter 10.

**The ""NSFW"" Factor:** It allows for very, *very* NSFW content. It does not moralize or deflect; it commits to the scene with surprising creativity.

**Voice:** It captures the specific cadence and syntax of the character perfectly, likely due to the live research phase.



# The Drawbacks:



It is not perfect. We are sacrificing the bells and whistles for raw literary power.

* **Multimedia Limits:** You are working with pure text. There are no fancy TTS (Text-to-Speech) voices cooing in your ear, and image generation is clunky compared to dedicated generators.
* **The UI:** It’s a chat interface, not a game.

**Future Project:** The next step up in quality might by possible by looking into the Chatbot API. I suspect a custom app combining this prompt structure with an ElevenLabs TTS hook (or an open source TTS module) and an image generator would be the endgame for interactive fiction.

**TL;DR:** Stop paying for lobotomized chatbots. Use Grok 4.1's massive context window and meta-prompting to build a roleplay partner that actually remembers the plot.",2,1764620798.0,ChatbotRefugees,4,0.6,False

Do you know the feeling: you wake up and your hand feels like it belongs to someone else. Your fingers are numb, tingly, or burning. You fumble your coffee mug, your phone slips out of your grip, and there’s this annoying ache that shoots from your wrist straight into your thumb, index, middle, and half of your ring finger.

Congratulations. You’ve probably just joined the millions of desk warriors with carpal tunnel syndrome.

Here’s the short version: the median nerve (the main cable that gives feeling and movement to most of your hand) has to squeeze through a tiny tunnel in your wrist made of bones and a tough ligament. When you type, scroll, click, and live with your wrists bent for 8–12 hours a day, that tunnel gets inflamed and swollen. The nerve gets crushed. You get pain, numbness, weakness, and the very real chance of permanent damage if you ignore it.

The good news? You can slow it down, stop it, and in many cases reverse the symptoms — especially if you catch it early. The bad news? Most people wait until they’re dropping everything and crying at 2 a.m. from the pain before they do anything.

**One of the simplest, most effective ways to get relief is by wearing a proper wrist brace.**

A quality wrist brace holds your wrist in a straight, neutral position while you sleep or work, taking pressure off the median nerve and allowing it to recover. Many people notice improvement in just a few days — and significant relief within weeks.

You can wear a brace:

* At night, this is when most people get the biggest benefit, because we often sleep with flexed wrists that worsen compression.
* During the day if your job or hobbies involve repetitive motions.
* Only during flare-ups or aggravating activities.

The key is consistency and choosing the right brace for your needs.

1pbnoy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1pbnoy1/what_i_wish_i_could_tell_the_guy_i_rejected_after/,What I Wish I Could Tell The Guy I Rejected After a Good Date.,"I'm making this post because I had an especially weird date and if nothing else this was cathartic for me to write. I don't speak for all women this is just how I go about things. You're free to disagree. 

My date was, by all conventional measures, great: charming, handsome, and he asked good questions. I brought a lot of energy and interest so it makes sense why he was completely blindsided when I said I wasn't interested in a second date. He got really strange and desperate when I said I wasn't interested so here's the feedback I'd give him:

I.) Please Respect Boundaries. When I state a boundary, I need it to be respected. If I have to repeat myself multiple times on small boundaries, I don’t feel heard and I start wondering how you'll behave when the stakes are higher.

Example 1: I said I just wanted a casual coffee date just to get to know him and while we were setting it up he tried to set up a second date at the same time. Then he tried to make our coffee date a full day event and he made me reiterate several times ""no just coffee. Let's see how things go before planning more.""

Example 2: I told him very clearly I wasn't comfortable with him paying; that I prefer to start things off on equal footing and would be paying for myself. He said ""how offended would you be if I did anyway? Guys are supposed to pay for pretty girls because it makes us feel good."" 

Note: This indicates to me that he's willing to prioritize his ego over my comfort and explicitly stated preferences. That's not a great sign. He's also making me reinforce a boundary again which makes me already suspicious of and disconnected from him before I even met him in person.

Enthusiasm is good but don't use your enthusiasm to bypass people's comfort.

II.) Learn to Recognize Soft ""No's"".

Examples:

-""We’ll see"" = a boundary, not an invitation to push harder.

-""Maybe another time"" = not now. Not up for debate. 

-""Just coffee"" = just coffee.

-""I'm interested but I'm only available in the evening."" = Please don't text me constantly. Let me have my space.

-""I'm busy tonight and I'll get back to you tomorrow."" = I'm tired and I want to play Minecraft because I'm not feeling social. Give me some space please.

When I soften a ""no"" I'm trying to be polite, not ambiguous. 

III.) You Cannot Manipulate Someone Into Loving You. Effort doesn’t create chemistry. Attraction isn't a negotiation. Love can’t be engineered; it has to be mutual. 

You can do everything right and still be rejected. All you can do is learn how to be respectful, develop the aspects of yourself you like the most and find a way to showcase them and hope someone will be interested.

IV.) Bring a Little Passion. Bring a Little Joy. 

On our date you didn't really talk about anything. I brought most of the energy. 

Note: The healthiest men I've personally seen readily talk about their family, their job, their hobbies, stuff they enjoy. They share personal anecdotes from childhood, they talk about a project that they're having fun with, they talk about their pets. I got nothing from this guy.

I don’t need a performance but give me something to connect to. Share what lights you up. Offer an emotional anchor.

V.) Ask instead of assuming leadership

Listen More, Project Less. You were projecting your own script of how a date should go instead of listening to what I was telling you.

My suggestion would be if you're the type of guy who thinks you need to set the tone of the date and you're the one who needs to be assertive considering phrasing it as a question e.g. ""Are you comfortable with X? Are you interested in doing Y?"" And then leave space for me to safely say ""no"". 

Your first goal is to make me feel safe with you which means showing that you care about what I want. 

VI.) Handle Rejection Gracefully

You can like someone and think they're great but not want to date them.

Rejection isn’t a moral judgment.
It’s not a failure.
It’s not something you can ""fix"" with the right words or gestures. 

When someone says they aren't interested in seeing you again, the right response is:

""I respect that. Thank you for letting me know. Wishing you the best.""

Anything else, such as begging for clarity, arguing, bribing, guilt-tripping, dramatic gestures, etc, comes across as pressure and manipulation and not romance. Do not say, ""is there anything I can do to change your mind? What did I do wrong? But I bought you this gift?""  

Have some self-respect. You deserve to want someone who also wants you.

No one is obligated to justify their no to you. You are not obligated to justify your no to anyone. 

I’m not unsympathetic. Rejection sucks, and it feels personal. But it’s not a reflection of your worth.

In conclusion: 

He wasn't dangerous. He wasn't creepy. The date went well enough. The red flags were mild all things considered but even those subtle breaches in trust were a preview of a dynamic I want no part of.

The issue wasn't the surface-level conversation which we connected a lot on, but a series of underlying behaviors that made me go ""yeah absolutely not.""

I don't think most men are trying to be pushy or manipulative. But if you don’t learn how a lot of women perceive certain behaviors, you might accidentally come across that way.

I didn't tell him these things because honestly it's not really my job and I'm sure it wouldn't have been productive coming from me. He'd likely have seen it as an opening to argue and debate. I just wanted a clean break.",67,1764620544.0,dating,25,0.77,False

Fortunately, we don’t have an issue with storage. The solid white door goes to the basement, and at the bottom of the steps are large shelves with small kitchen appliances and extra supplies that we don’t need daily.  

We do NOT need a breakfast nook. The dining room is attached to the kitchen and we prefer to eat in there.  

What we are looking for:  
- Wall paint color. If it helps, our living room is Sumptuous Sage (Valspar) and our hallways are Dulce De Leche (Valspar). We are still figuring out what to do with dining room paint, it’s a tan color but we aren’t keeping it like that. Accent colors in other rooms are mustard, rust, and terracotta. Our bathroom is the original 1948 peach and burgundy tiled bathroom.   
- Kitchen cabinet color  
- What to do with the weird corner by the window    
- Flooring ideas  
- Light fixtures  
- Cabinet hardware   
 
Additional info:  
- Residents include 2 adults, 1 toddler, 1 baby on the way   
- Current floor is covering asbestos flooring     
- We don’t want to keep the table; it’s just a catchall area right now  
- A coffee/tea station may be useful    
- There is no outlet over the desk/drawer thing, and we can’t have one put in without tearing into the wall. We already had an electrician look into this and it would be much more difficult than simply adding an outlet.   
- We are not removing the radiator as it provides a significant amount of heat to the kitchen   
- Window above sink faces 47°NE  
- Window above table faces 140°SE  
- The cabinets used to be beautiful natural wood according to old Zillow pictures, but the previous owners slapped on one shitty coat of white paint when selling. It looks poorly done.

1pbnjkz,https://i.redd.it/5ne7y98vhn4g1.jpeg,Localized Crypto Engagement: Hyperlocal Marketing Tactics,"# Bringing Blockchain to the Block  \
Localized crypto engagement describes outreach that happens at the scale of a neighborhood, zip code, or even an individual street. The concept moves blockchain from abstract global finance into the context of daily routines—grabbing coffee, visiting a laundromat, or walking past a convenience store with a Bitcoin ATM. Once that tangible presence exists, curiosity typically replaces skepticism, creating the first step toward sustained adoption.\
\
## Why a Neighborhood Presence Accelerates Adoption  \
Community-level exposure reduces the perceived risk of new technology. Residents who watch a corner retailer accept Ethereum or witness friends scanning Lightning invoices perceive the activity as normal rather than speculative. A nearby kiosk offers on-site demonstrations, immediate feedback, and the chance to experiment with small amounts of value.  \
\
Key advantages of hyperlocal visibility include:  \
- Familiar surroundings that lower the intimidation factor.  \
- Face-to-face explanations from merchants or community volunteers.  \
- Word-of-mouth referrals that travel quickly within tightly knit social circles.  \
- Fewer marketing dollars wasted on unqualified audiences outside the service radius.\
\
## Working With Zip Code-Level Insights  \
General campaigns often ignore the nuances within a single city. Zip code analytics—mobile data usage, average age, density of freelancers, or foot traffic patterns—highlight micro-pockets where early adopters cluster. Marketers overlay these findings with blockchain transaction heat maps to spot areas where wallets are already in use yet convenient on-ramps remain scarce.  \
\
A typical rollout sequence starts with high-traffic nodes such as co-working spaces, apartment complexes, or community colleges. Each location can host mini-workshops covering wallet setup, private key safety, and basic exchanges between residents. Live demonstrations remove theoretical barriers and reveal immediate utility: splitting rent, paying a local food truck, or receiving tips for digital art.\
\
## Combining On-Chain and Location Data  \
Web 3.0 interactions are inherently data-rich. Wallet addresses broadcast activity timestamps, transaction sizes, and preferred networks. When aggregated and anonymized, that on-chain information supplements geofenced mobile analytics. The result is a feedback loop that answers three questions in real time:  \
1. Is interest rising or falling in a specific block radius?  \
2. Which chains or tokens dominate local transactions?  \
3. How quickly do newcomers perform a second or third transaction?  \
\
A mall kiosk, for example, can push a limited-window incentive to any wallet that pings within 100 meters. The message appears as a wallet notification offering reduced fees for converting small dollar amounts. Alignment between physical proximity and digital behavior raises conversion rates without relying on broad, less relevant ads.\
\
## Search Optimization for “Near Me” Queries  \
Search engines increasingly surface map packs for phrases like “crypto ATM near me.” To capture that intent, business profiles need accurate hours, images of the actual machine, and concise descriptions that reflect neighborhood slang or landmarks. Structured data—latitude, longitude, accepted coins—helps crawlers understand relevance.  \
\
Content strategy remains equally important. Short blog entries or forum posts that describe how a specific borough reduced remittance fees with stablecoins answer localized questions that generic explainers miss. Each article benefits from:  \
- Descriptive headings containing the district, suburb, or intersection.  \
- Schema markup specifying service areas.  \
- Internal links connecting to event calendars or FAQ pages on wallet safety.  \
\
When executed consistently, these tactics lift organic rankings and appear trustworthy to residents searching for nearby solutions rather than global exchanges.\
\
## Community Storytelling as Social Proof  \
Case studies grounded in real neighbors build authenticity. A café owner describing weekend sales in USDC or a charity detailing transparent donation flows resonates more than abstract ROI claims. Video snippets filmed on local streets, geotagged photos of successful pop-up events, or testimonials captured at maker spaces all signal practical value.  \
\
Because the content originates from within the community, it spreads organically across neighborhood Facebook groups, Nextdoor threads, and Telegram channels. That informal distribution supplements paid placements without additional budget.\
\
## Metrics That Matter at Street Level  \
Traditional key performance indicators—impressions, clicks, and national brand awareness—offer limited insight for hyperlocal efforts. More relevant measures include:  \
- Daily unique wallets interacting within a defined radius.  \
- Repeat usage per individual ATM or point-of-sale terminal.  \
- Social media mentions tagged with neighborhood names.  \
- Workshop attendance and follow-up transaction counts.  \
\
These metrics reveal whether education, accessibility, and trust are improving over time.\
\
## Practical Takeaways for Teams  \
- Start small: a single zip code often provides clearer feedback than a citywide launch.  \
- Use mixed venues: libraries, coffee shops, and coworking hubs draw different demographics.  \
- Sync incentives with physical convenience: discounts or airdrops work best when an ATM or accepting merchant is steps away.  \
- Refresh localized content regularly so search algorithms and community members see up-to-date information.  \
- Iterate based on wallet analytics and foot traffic patterns rather than national trends.\
\
### Conclusion  \
Hyperlocal crypto marketing is less about splashy headlines and more about integrating blockchain into everyday life. By blending zip code insights, on-chain data, and neighborhood storytelling, adoption grows from the ground up with minimal friction and maximal relevance.\

1pbngul,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1pbngul/6_month_update/,6 month update,"Hello fellow warriors, I thought a 6 month update might bring a little hope to some (including me)? Long post but you can skip to ""what helped"" lower down if that's what interests you.

**Background:** Floxed in May 2025 after six 200mg pills of Ofloxacin for an uncomplicated UTI. I began feeling symptoms of mild weakness in my legs after 2 pills, and wondered if it was a reaction to the drug, but brushed it off (wrong). During the third night, I woke up with burning sensations throughout my chest, torso, pelvis, upper legs, and arms, and stopped taking the meds at that point. About a month later, my floxie diagnosis was confirmed by an infectious diseases specialist. 

**Main symptoms**: Burning sensations and fasciculaitons throughout whole body; weakness in legs an arms; pain in hands and feet; fatigue; general feeling of unwellness; muscle spasming in chest and back; muscle tension that feels like restlessness; headaches; occasional joint pain; a few random nosebleeds; poor sleep. These have fluctuated a lot, with flare-ups happening several times including one time immediately after trying 200mg ibuprofen for menstrual pain. Otherwise, I can't say what flared me! In the first month or two, my anxiety, fear, and depression was pretty high.

**Current situation:** The past 3-4 weeks is the first time I've felt a consistent level of higher energy, allowing me to increase my frequency and intensity of exercise, which is tending to help. I have also started to feel motivated to attempt a return to work, whereas a couple months ago the idea still filled me with dread and stress. I still have occasional, relatively mild burning pain and have accepted that it may last a long time. I still have weird things happen to my body that never did before - like muscle spasms occurring for strange reasons. I am no where near the level of physical activity I was capable of before and I don't trust my body to do what I want at all anymore. I still sleep poorly many nights. But having higher energy levels, and less intense symptoms overall, makes a huge difference.  
  
**What helped for sure:**

* taking sick leave. I have been off work since July.
*  Working a lot on down-regulating my nervous system and anxiety through breath work, meditation, light exercise and walking outdoors, removing as much stress and responsibility as possible from my life, acupuncture, focusing on activities that bring comfort and a feeling of safety, and psychotherapy. I have realized I think my nervous system was in high gear for a long time before this happened, and if my neuropathic symptoms are going to last a long time, it will help to train myself to have less reaction and anxiety to them.
*  Working with non-doctor health professionals like a physiotherapist, acupuncturist, massage therapist, and psychotherapist (thank you health insurance - none of these services are covered by universal health coverage in Canada). These people have just listened to me and tried to help me with my problems, rather than doubting me or trying to convince me that what happened to me is impossible or unlikely. They were open to learning about FQ toxicity without questioning it.
* Exercising as much as possible, even if very light. Having a physiotherapist help me with this was key to evaluating if there was any risk to my tendons, clarifying what was important to start with, and making sure I don't overdo it. For me, this started with light exercise every other day focused on getting the heart rate up and improving energy levels.
* This sub, FQ Toxicity Study site, and Dr. Pieper's book helped a lot at the beginning but also stressed me out. I am not sure there was a better way to do things since I needed the information and the support, and I wasn't going to get it from medical professionals generally, but at some point I got saturated and took a break, which also helped.
* Asking for support from friends and family.
* Having a family doctor who really wanted to help. She didn't buy the FQ toxicity at first, but I insisted she investigate it and she eventually agreed, which is how I was referred to infectious diseases and got a diagnosis. 

**Other things I did, but I don't know if they helped:**

* Cutting out alcohol and caffeine completely. I had already cut out caffeinated coffee before this happened, and I was never a big drinker, so this wasn't difficult for me.
* Taking supplements (CoQ10, Vit C; D3+K2; B1; B12; NAC; magnesium glycinate; creatine).
* An anti-inflammatory, low-acid, no sugar or processed food diet for 1 month (this WAS difficult!). My abdominal pain did seem a lot better after this, but I didn't notice a big change in other symptoms. The digestive issues may have been just another side effect of the antibiotics that would have worn off eventually. I've since gone back to a much less restrictive diet (although still no alcohol and caffeine) and I haven't noticed huge changes in my symptoms so I am not sure food makes a huge difference to me.

There you go! Best of luck to all of you. Maybe I'll come back in another 6 months with good news again....I truly hope so!

“TEV-RC1, this is UMC Angry Ferret. Do you read?”

I bolted upright in the pilot seat and checked the scanners. According to what I saw, there was a small patrol craft following me. A quick look at the identifier confirmed Terran Military origin, which was a little strange since I was in Hemral Trade Federation space and less than an hour from leaving the station.

“This is TEV-RC1,” I responded professionally. “Affirm. I hear you loud and clear.”

“TEV-RC1, kill your engines and prepare to be boarded.”

“Please confirm,” I answered with confusion and a growing pit in my stomach. “Are you ordering me to shut down engines and hold position?”

“Confirmed. Hold position and await further instructions from the boarding team.”

“Copy,” I said as I reached over to shut down the engines. “Holding position.”

My stomach churned as I waited the next five minutes as the blip on the scanner approached at definitely not civilian speed. 

I gawked as a sleek vessel pulled up alongside me with a paintjob that seemed to fade into the blackness of space. The running lights were the only reason I could identify the shape and see that it was there, and I can assure you the vessel was not small as indicated by the scanner. An oversized turret of some sort was barely visible on the top with an outline that suggested enough firepower to blast a hole clean through any civilian ship, and likely anything military as well. 

A docking port was extended and rapidly connected to the airlock, but to my surprise the outer door only cycled once as someone boarded my ship and then quickly closed the outer hatch. The docking port disconnected and the “small patrol craft” started moving away and faded entirely from my scanners and vision in less than 10 seconds.

The inner door cycled and opened revealing a Terran Marine in full military flight gear. 

“What’s going on?” I asked as the pilot headed straight to the cockpit.

“Beats me,” a male voice responded. “I’ve just got orders to fly you back to the embassy. FYI, while I’m here the temporary designation of this vessel is UMC-RC1.”

With that informative conversation concluded, he commandeered the vessel and flew us back to the planet. Interestingly enough, we were cleared to fly and land directly outside the Terran Embassy. After touching down, the pilot turned to me.

“Go ahead into the embassy while I complete post-flight checks,” he said in a tone that wasn’t a suggestion.

I headed to the airlock and pressed the actuator to lower the ramp. With the ramp down, I opened the door and was assaulted by a loud and obnoxious alarm going off somewhere outside the vessel.

“What in the stars is that?” I grumbled as I put my hands over my ears to block the noise. As soon as my feet stepped off the ramp onto the ground, the alarm stopped, there were three sharp chirps, and then blessed silence.

“Well, thank goodness that’s over. Talk about irritating,” I commented quietly to myself as embassy security came over and then quickly and silently escorted me into the building. I found myself brought directly to the office of the Terran Ambassador and admitted immediately.

“Haasha!” the Terran Ambassador gushed out excitedly and with a big smile. “So wonderful to see you again! Please, come in. We have much to discuss.”

“How can I be of assistance?” I asked timidly.

“First, we have a momentous occasion to celebrate,” she said as she pulled out a can of cider and poured a glass for each of us.

“Oh, really?” I asked as I relaxed. “What happened?”

“Please, take a sip,” she said as she handed me a glass.

We clinked glasses and each took a sip.

“Did you know that you set a record?” she declared with gusto. “The most complaints for a single incident in the history of the Terran Embassy Complaints Department! And the irony is you aren’t even human.”

My eyes widened and I blurted out, “Wait, what?”

“Oh, before I explain, I have one teensy question to ask,” she said as she tilted her head to one side and blinked her eyes innocently at me. “Where might we find your Terran Marine issued void suit?”

“My void suit?” I asked as my face wrinkled in confusion. “It’s…”

Oh, crap. In a storage unit here at the embassy. But how…

“Ahh! I see you’re starting to understand the problem,” the ambassador said with a giggle. “Did you know that Tac-1 activated a rather loud alarm when you left the planet?”

“No.”

“Did you know that said alarm was rather obnoxious and caused every living being within a three-block radius to head into the Complaints Department to lodge a noise complaint?” the ambassador asked with an exaggerated smile. “An alarm that only just stopped as you stepped off your ship?”

“No, ma’am. But don’t you have the ability to override the locks and get into the embassy storage lockers?” I wondered aloud. I still didn’t quite understand how things escalated into such a big deal. A quick message and I could have turned around and returned to the spaceport. “I would think it shouldn’t be a problem to open the locker and pull Tac-1 out to disable the alarm.”

“You’d think so,” the ambassador said slowly with a cheerful smile as she brought up a security recording of the locker and technicians trying, and failing miserably, to override and open the lock. Every time they did something to the lock, a familiar voice could be heard repeating the same thing. 

*This storage unit may only be accessed by VIP Haasha. Entry denied. VIP Haasha is currently missing. Please contact appropriate authorities so VIP Haasha can be located to provide assistance opening this storage unit.*

“Care to explain why I can’t open one of my own damn storage units?” the ambassador growled as her expression and tone turned to ice.

Ten minutes later, I exited the ambassador’s office in shock. Some of her suggestions on what I should do with my tail were truly… vile. Inspired, but vile.

As punishment, I would be spending the night and assigned to duties supporting the Complaints Department in the morning. Details would be provided when I arrived for my shift. Under no circumstances would I be allowed out of the embassy until my service was complete, and once my work here was done I would be on my ship and returning to the TEV Ursa Minor as originally scheduled.

Outside communications? No talking to friends or arranging for a hang out session since I would be in the embassy another day. I was limited to communications from command staff of the TEV Ursa Minor.

Captain Victor: “Really, Haasha?”

Quartermaster Jarl: “Really, Haasha?”

Chief Science Officer Susan: “Really, Haasha?”

First Officer Auggie: “Really, Haasha?”

Chief Engineer Rosa: “Really, Haasha?”

For some reason, I really didn’t want to respond to their messages.

Accommodations for the evening were definitely not what I expected. Rather than getting one of the cozy guest rooms, I was demoted to a couch in an unused office with a pillow and a blanket. The only one satisfied with my sleeping quarters was Mistress Murder Mittens who discovered my location and declared me the chosen cat bed of the evening. 

In the morning I headed down to the break room where I would receive my assignment. Upon entering, all conversation stopped as I found myself in the break room assigned to the Complaints Department. The entire staff glared at me as I shuffled into the room.

Not having had breakfast, I picked at the raspberry filled donut I had grabbed from the communal pastry tray until the ambassador arrived to explain my assignment. In the meantime, it was all I could do to not wilt under the gaze of 13 angry humans.

“Ladies and gentlemen!” the ambassador called out with a smile as she entered the room. “I’m sure you are all acquainted with Haasha and the teensy little incident from yesterday. To make up for her mistake, she will be serving as your gofer for the day.”

“What’s a gofer?” I asked, never having heard the term before.

“It means that if someone here asks you for something, you’re going to go for it,” she explained happily. “Coffee, tea, desk supplies, snacks, lunch, anything their hearts desire to make the day easier.”

The expressions on the Complaints Department staff softened a little bit and looked at me with consideration.

“Oh, and one more thing,” the ambassador said as turned her full attention back to the staff. “Haasha needs to understand and share your pain. Make sure her experience as your gofer is just as rewarding as the complaints you dealt with yesterday as the result of her forgetfulness.”

The faces of the department staff instantly shifted to wicked and calculating grins.

My unexpected extra day in the embassy was not going to be enjoyable.

When I first started med school. I was in a class of 35 students so relatively small class. However, I didnt fit in. It became apparently by the first week.

I tried to be social such as introducing myself to others and sitting next to others in the cafe. I noticed that my friendless was met with neutral energy. By the end of the first week, everyone had figure out the people they wanted to be friends with. I knew that something was off when I went to the first bar event. Everyone had car pooled except me and people had formed social circles. I will admit that I am not the best conversalists but I wasnt given a fair opportunity. Most people would stop talking to me within one minute if I was not engaging enough.

I tried to not take it personally, but I was iced out at the next social event. No one expecting me to come. At this point trying to talk to women in the class was pointless. It was clear I was unpopular and most of the women didnt even try to hold a convo except my future female friend. She ironically was the prettiest girl and she took me under her wing. She friended me first on instagram. She even told me that you dont have to sit alone.

Till this day, Idk if she ever liked me. I say this because in the beginning she was extremely touchy and teased me alot. She clam down once she got a bf. But it was crazy becuase I asked her to let me take her to the bar. She agreed and even brought me a cookie as thanks. At the bar, she made it clear that I took her and I was taking her home. I screwed up back then being shy so she went home with another dude lol. That is why I say she might had a small crush. We only stayed friends because she actively text me even presently. But back to the story.

I had it tough. I even tried to become more social by talking more. People just made fun of me. Alot of the guys would hang with my female friend and block opportunities for me to connect. Like inviting her to their house and a couple others. I tried therapy, social skill training, and life coaching. At first I was gaslit into thinking I was the problem. However, at they heard me complain about how people typically never talk to me first unless I walk up to them. They told me to just move on. My last ditch effort was to get drunk with them since I am actually the life of the party. They recording me drinking and claim I was an alcoholic. And that I love driving home drunk.

There was no people on the outside unfortunately. All I had was coffee shops and hobbies. Eventually I isolated myself and moved on. Now 2 years today, I dont even talk to any of them except my female friend. I have a soft side for her since she was supportive back then.

But was there a better way to handle this? It significantly added to the reason why I think everyone is fake and I dont like to socialize as much anymore.",1,1764619975.0,confidence,1,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The last 3 straight meetings between these two squads have stayed well below 234.5, friends. If you’ve watched any of their last 3 meetings, it’s easy to draw the conclusion that the Suns know they need to play an aggressively slow/defensive-heavy game if they want a chance at keeping things close with Los Angeles. The Lakers have been on a roll at home and have cashed the Over in 4 of their last 5 outings, but they also come into this encounter on a back-to-back. Between that and the low-scoring trend, my money’s on the Under to hit here.
