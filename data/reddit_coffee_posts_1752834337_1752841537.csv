1m30we1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Quality4576/comments/1m30we1/how_ai_is_revolutionizing_work_efficiency_and/,How AI is Revolutionizing Work Efficiency and Speed in 2025,"As we navigate through 2025, artificial intelligence has become as commonplace in our workplaces as morning coffee and Monday meetings. Yet, unlike that familiar cup of joe, AI’s effects on our professional lives are far more complex and nuanced. While some herald it as the ultimate productivity booster, others warn of its potential pitfalls. The reality, as with most transformative technologies, lies somewhere in between.

**The Acceleration Revolution: How AI is Supercharging Workplace Efficiency**

The most immediate and tangible benefit of AI in the workplace is its ability to handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks with unprecedented speed. In 2025, we’re seeing AI systems that can process thousands of documents in minutes, analyze complex datasets in real-time, and generate initial drafts of reports faster than any human could type. This isn’t just about replacing manual labor; it’s about freeing up human cognitive resources for more strategic, creative work.

Consider how AI has revolutionized customer service operations. Chatbots now handle 80% of routine inquiries, allowing human agents to focus on complex problem-solving and relationship building. Similarly, in content creation, AI tools can generate first drafts, suggest improvements, and even optimize content for different audiences, transforming writers from creators to curators and editors.

The impact on internal communication has been particularly striking. AI-powered platforms now summarize lengthy email threads, schedule meetings based on everyone’s availability and preferences, and even translate messages in real-time for global teams. These systems have eliminated much of the administrative overhead that once bogged down collaborative work, allowing teams to focus on actual collaboration rather than coordination logistics.

**The Creative Catalyst: AI as “The Storyteller”**

One of the most fascinating developments in 2025 is AI’s emergence as “[the storyteller](https://www.ticworks.com/)” in business contexts. Beyond simple data analysis, AI systems now craft compelling narratives from raw information, helping organizations communicate complex insights to stakeholders. Marketing teams use AI to generate personalized content at scale, while executives rely on AI-generated executive summaries that don’t just present facts but weave them into coherent, actionable narratives.

This storytelling capability has proven invaluable in industries ranging from healthcare, where AI helps doctors explain complex diagnoses to patients, to finance, where AI transforms dense market data into accessible investment stories. The speed at which AI can generate these narratives has accelerated decision-making processes across organizations.

**The Productivity Paradox: When Speed Becomes a Trap**

However, the AI revolution isn’t without its shadows. The very speed that makes AI so attractive can become a double-edged sword. The pressure to match AI’s pace has led to what researchers call “productivity anxiety” — a condition where workers feel constantly pressured to perform at machine-like efficiency levels.

Moreover, the rapid output of AI systems can overwhelm human decision-makers. When an AI can generate dozens of reports, hundreds of content pieces, or thousands of analysis points in a single day, the bottleneck shifts from creation to evaluation. Many organizations are discovering that having too much AI-generated content can be as problematic as having too little human-generated content.

**The Human Element: What We Lose in Translation**

Perhaps the most significant concern about AI’s impact on work efficiency is the potential erosion of human skills and intuition. As AI systems become more sophisticated, there’s a risk that workers may become overly dependent on these tools, leading to a decline in critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.

The phenomenon is already visible in various fields. Accountants who rely heavily on AI for analysis may lose their ability to spot anomalies that don’t fit algorithmic patterns. Writers who depend on AI for ideation might find their own creative muscles atrophying. Even in “[internal communication](https://www.ticworks.com/services/internal-communications)” Over-reliance on AI mediators can reduce the authentic human connections that often drive innovation and team cohesion.

**The Quality vs. Quantity Dilemma**

AI’s ability to produce work at breakneck speed has created a new challenge: maintaining quality while maximizing quantity. While AI can generate content, analysis, and solutions faster than ever before, the nuanced judgment required to ensure quality often still requires human oversight. This has led to a new type of workflow where speed is balanced against the need for human verification and refinement.

Organizations are learning that the most effective approach isn’t to let AI run unchecked but to create hybrid workflows where AI handles the heavy lifting while humans provide strategic direction and quality control. This balance is crucial for maintaining both efficiency and excellence.

**The Skills Evolution: Adapting to an AI-Augmented Future**

The workforce of 2025 is rapidly adapting to this new reality. The most successful professionals are those who have learned to work alongside AI rather than compete against it. This means developing skills in AI prompt engineering, understanding how to effectively collaborate with AI systems, and maintaining the uniquely human abilities that AI cannot replicate — such as emotional intelligence, creative thinking, and ethical judgment.

Training programs are evolving to focus on these hybrid skills. Companies are investing in “AI literacy” programs that teach employees not just how to use AI tools but how to think critically about AI outputs and maintain their own professional judgment.

**Looking Forward: The Sustainable AI Workplace**

As we progress through 2025, the key to harnessing AI’s benefits while avoiding its pitfalls lies in creating sustainable AI integration strategies. This means designing workflows that leverage AI’s speed and efficiency while preserving human creativity, intuition, and well-being.

The most successful organizations are those that view AI not as a replacement for human workers but as a powerful tool that can amplify human capabilities. They’re creating environments where AI handles routine tasks, freeing humans to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationship building — the areas where human intelligence still reigns supreme.

The future of work efficiency isn’t about choosing between human and artificial intelligence; it’s about finding the optimal balance between speed and thoughtfulness, automation and creativity, efficiency and humanity. As we continue to navigate this AI-augmented workplace, the organizations and individuals who succeed will be those who can harness the power of AI while maintaining the essential human elements that drive innovation, empathy, and meaningful work.

In this new landscape, the question isn’t whether AI will continue to transform work efficiency and speed — it’s how we’ll shape that transformation to serve not just our productivity goals but our human values and aspirations as well.",1,1752841393.0,u_Ok-Quality4576,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I brewed another coffee with exactly the same setup (water, brewer, filters, grinder and recipe) and it was amazing. I’m not sick or anything, all other food tastes normal. I usually use specific bottled water with good ppm, bought a new bottle to check the water and still no difference. Also descaled my kettle between 2 and 3 coffee but for very subtle change in the result.

All the coffees brewed today were a month or more post roast, I have them dialed in and mysteriously today they decided to go completely flat. Interestingly the aroma in the cup is pretty similar as it was before.

At this point I’m in doubt of my taste buds, any of you experienced anything like this?

**Random Gelato Cravings** 

I am foody. And I like eating the best food in the city where I stay. I tasted every flavor of Gelato whenever I saw a shop in my vicinity. It probably gained me a lot of weight. But it was totally worth it.  

**Wandering in the Streets of Venice** 

Venice is just a blessing if you love sitting in water with peace. As I was travelling solo, I ditched the Google map and wandered subtly in the streets of Venice. Here I bumped into a hidden bookstore and a small cafe where I had the best coffee of my life. 

**Italy = The FOOD**

Handmade pasta in Bologna, seafood risotto on the  Neapolitan pizza in Naples, on the Amalfi Coast, every meal was like a warm hug. I even took a pasta-making class with a nonna in Florence, and yes, I cried happy tears.That was just a few moments. My entire trip was full of the happiest food and madly dancing in the Roman Piazza. It is not just a historical but a fun place for solo traveling.

Ava followed a step behind, her gaze flitting over the peeling paint, the dusty window, the small things no one noticed unless they were new.

“Careful of the third step,” Jeffrey muttered without turning. “Creaks loud enough to wake the dead.”

Ava nodded. Her foot hovered a moment before continuing, light and sure.

The apartment door stuck a little, then gave way with a shoulder nudge. The space beyond was clean, if lived-in: muted walls, a threadbare couch, a cluttered desk littered with open circuit boards and mugs with ancient coffee stains. Books were stacked along every surface like forgotten ruins.

Ava stood just inside the doorway, taking it in quietly.

Jeff dropped his keys into a bowl shaped like a cat’s mouth and glanced back at her. “Not much, but it’s home. You hungry?”

“I could eat,” she said, voice smooth but soft. A little cautious.

He gestured toward the couch. “Make yourself at home. I’ve got leftover noodles from Bao’s down the street. Still edible, probably.”

Ava perched on the edge of the couch—not stiff, just... deliberate. Like someone unused to taking up space. She ran her fingers lightly along the seam in the cushion, feeling the texture like it meant something.

Jeffrey’s microwave beeped as he glanced her way again. “You okay? You’re kinda... quiet.”

She smiled, small and practiced. “Still finding my footing. It’s been a strange day.”

That was an understatement, but he didn’t press. Who *wasn’t* walking around a little cracked lately?

He handed her the bowl of noodles and a fork, watching as she twirled them deftly, like someone who’d done it a hundred times. Nothing weird. Nothing “off.” But something about her movements still felt *intentional*, like every word and gesture was being gently tested before use.

Her eyes drifted to a faded photo pinned to the bookshelf—a teenage girl with a bright grin, throwing peace signs at the camera.

“Your sister?”

“Was.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Went missing a few years back. Cops gave up. I didn’t.”

Ava looked at him then—really looked. “I’m sorry.”

Jeff nodded, lips pressing into a line. “Yeah. Me too.”

There was a silence. Not awkward. Just... present.

“I can sleep on the couch,” Ava said.

Jeff blinked. “I didn’t even ask you to stay yet.”

“I know. But I can tell you want to offer. And I’d rather be somewhere with a locked door tonight.”

He let out a breath, half a laugh, half something heavier.

“You’re real good at reading people.”

She met his gaze. “I’ve had a lot of practice.”

Jeff turned toward the kitchenette, busying himself with a mug and half-stale tea. “Alright. Couch is yours. Spare blanket’s in the basket by the window. Bathroom’s through there—door sticks a bit.”

She moved past him lightly, brushing close. Warm. Real. A little too composed, but not enough to seem strange. Just... well-raised. Or maybe well-wounded.

He watched her for a moment longer than he meant to.

She didn’t notice.

Or maybe she did.

1m30h0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1m30h0l/found/,Found,"The rain had stopped an hour ago, but the city still glistened under the streetlights—wet asphalt like spilled ink. Steam curled up from sewer grates. The world smelled like old smoke, wet concrete, and the ghost of fried food.

Jeffrey stepped out the back of his repair shop, tugging the hood of his jacket up as he lit a cigarette. The flick of his lighter briefly lit up the chipped bricks around him, his face worn by late nights and too much coffee. The buzz of the neon sign still hummed faintly behind him: **YIELD TECH REPAIRS**.

He wasn’t expecting company.

That’s when he saw her.

She sat on the edge of the alley, knees drawn up, arms around them. Barefoot. Hair plastered to her face, skin smeared with city dust. But there was something… strange. Too still. Too composed. Her eyes didn’t dart around the way you’d expect from someone in trouble—they were fixed calmly on the cars beyond, tracking taillights like shooting stars.

“You okay?” Jeffrey called out, cautious.

The woman blinked, slowly, then tilted her head. “I’m not sure yet. I think I might be.”

Her voice was even. Too even.

He took a drag on his cigarette, watching her through narrowed eyes. She didn’t look high. Or drunk. No tremor in her hands. No twitch in her face. Just… off.

“Do you need help?” he asked, careful to keep his tone neutral.

“I think I do. But I’m not sure what kind.” She smiled faintly, like a crooked apology. “Sorry. I’m a bit scrambled.”

Jeffrey stepped closer, one slow step at a time. She didn’t flinch. Up close, he could see the oddities more clearly—perfect skin, no visible bruises or scratches despite her being out in the rain. Her clothes were too clean for someone living rough, but slightly too disheveled to be freshly changed. Her hair was wet, but her eyes were dry. She met his gaze directly, without hesitation.

“No ID?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“Name?”

A pause. “Ava. I think. It’s the one that feels right.”

Jeff frowned. “Feels right?”

“I tried a few. ‘Jessica’ was all wrong. ‘Sarah’ made me want to punch a wall. But Ava…” she looked up at the clouds, like listening for an answer, “that one fits.”

His stomach twisted—not with fear, but familiarity. His younger sister used to talk like that. Before she disappeared. A decade ago, just… gone. A runaway? Abducted? Nobody ever found out. But the not-knowing had carved a hollow space in him, one he never quite managed to fill.

He flicked his cigarette to the wet ground and crushed it underfoot.

“Do you have anyone? Friends? Family?”

Ava hesitated. “No. Not anymore. I don’t think I’m what they’d want to find.”

That landed harder than he expected.

Jeffrey studied her again. The vulnerability was subtle, buried deep beneath that eerie composure—but it was there. Real or not, it was enough.

He sighed, rubbing the back of his neck.

“Well, Ava,” he said, “I’ve got a couch, a half-dead heater, and some leftover noodles if you’re hungry. It’s not glamorous, but it’s dry.”

Her smile flickered—grateful, gentle. And again, that strange warmth in her eyes, too human to fake.

“You have no idea how much I needed noodles right now.”

He turned and gestured for her to follow.

As she stood—fluidly, like a dancer masking a limp—he caught something else in her expression. Relief, yes… but also fear. Not fear of him. Fear of being seen too closely.

He didn’t press. Not yet.

But something deep in his gut told him: this girl wasn’t just lost.

She was hiding.

And whatever she was hiding from... it wasn’t just the street.

Heyy! I’m 18F and (fingers crossed 🤞) most likely heading to SRCC this year!
I’m looking for a PG that’s spacious, has a nice window view (don’t ask why, I just need a window to vibe with 😭🥰), and ideally around 24k per month. Good food is a must – I can survive a lot, but bad food isn’t one of them 😅

A little about me: I’m a huge Brooklyn Nine-Nine fan (NINE-NINE!!), love binge-watching movies and shows literally all the time 🍿🎬, and I’d like to think I’m a chill nerd – I enjoy studying but also love goofing around and having deep 2am convos ✨

I’m looking for a roommate who’s friendly, clean-ish (no judgment though 😂), and up for random coffee runs, Netflix marathons, and maybe helping each other adult our way through college!

**May 24**

“Wait, the boss slept with you?”  Jacob says this far too loudly.

I walk over. “We live together and nothing happened. If you ever blurt out something that loudly again about me and a partner, with guests in the room, you will be cleaning the bathrooms every shift you have. FOREVER. I will buy a toothbrush for you to use.”

“Goblins use the toilets.”

My anger fuels my answer, “And then I don’t have to pay a professional service to clean the restrooms when I can have employees, you specifically, do it, now do I?”

“Ma’am, it will never happen again, ma’am!”  His military time always shows up when I remind him of Gunny. Whoever the hell that is. 

I turn to my roommate, best friend, and now troublemaker.

“You, office, now.”  Jackie whitens at my tone. 

She is wearing a skirt that while technically is within dress code, it is doing a lot of work to make you think it isn’t.  *Bitch is sashaying in front of me as she goes.* 

We pass Mommy and Connie talking and Connie glances at us with a look of worry.  I almost slam the door.  I catch a glimpse of someone imagining us passionately kissing. Yeesh. I gotta stop this. Jackie looks up at me expectantly.  

“We have a weird situation. I was just your shift supervisor when we became friends. I was your manager when we moved together. I now own this franchise and rent a place from a centaur with you. And I have told you about my darkest moments over ice cream.”

She nods. *She looks so worried.*

“I love you Jackie and I am not wanting to lose you. You are my best friend and, honestly, an amazing roommate. So, PLEASE, stop saying things that could cause me to lose my license with Corporate.”

Her face reveals total shock.  Horror follows it fast. She didn’t think about something like that being possible. 

“I am an owner. If they think I am having sex with a shift supervisor, I am on the chopping block, not you. Because I am in the power position. Hell, they might look at your position and think it was due to bias or bribery.  Stop saying things like that here.”

“Sorry, I was just unbearably happy. He asked why and I blurted it out.”  She looks upset and something I can’t place.

“Sleeping next to my snoring ass that drooled on your pillow made you happy?”

“No. Laying awake nearly the entire night next to you did.  Look Pat… I need to…I need to tell you that I am in lo…”

The crash outside interrupts us. I’ll have to ask about this later.  I walk out and see 2 customers beating the hell out of each other. One is a human, and he is getting in a brawling match with a hobgoblin.  Not a great match up for him.  Jacob doesn’t know what to do and Grace is wisely just trying to keep up with drive thru and not get involved as she would get hurt.

At about 6’ tall I am actually intimidating to some people. I go to break them up and the human doesn’t even notice me.  I get pushed a bit by the hobgoblin.  I feel something hit my foot.  The other guy seems to finally notice me now as I continue to tell them to knock it off. 

Wait, he just now noticed me?  That thing hitting my foot was my charm… Shit!

 The human then gets a serious face and punches me in the nose. I feel a familiar crunch.  God dammit!  The pain is still blinding, if familiar.  That is bad enough, but he follows immediately with another to my jaw.   He hits like a pro.  This was a set up?  And he wants me dead; I can feel it.  Like the knife attack.  My world goes white with pain from that uppercut, and I feel myself falling, I see his fist coming for my face as I hit my head on the corner of the table.  Oh fuck!

I hear noises that can’t be human and a commotion.  Multiple hands grab me and move me.  There’s panic in there.  I hear rage and screaming.   Is that a cat hissing?  And cooking?  I can barely open my eyes. The pain from the light is so horrible. People yelling to get her off him. Weird, I am not on anyone. Next thing I can see is Jackie. Her face is wet from tears and blood? She is kind of blurry. She is saying something, but the pain is so much I can’t hear anything above the ringing in my ears. Opening my eyes is blinding.  So much light.  She holds up fingers in one hand. Why are they covered in blood?  I think she wants me to say how many she is holding up on that hand.  *Silly thing.  I mean it is obvious.*  I blurt out “6.”  See?  Obvious.  The look on her face tells me I was probably wrong.

More hands. More noise. Oh hey, police lights. Cops are here. “We don’t have donuts”. I am sure they will understand.  Maybe I should comp them some coffee?  We do have pastry, I should offer them some. They look worried too.  *Is my nose that much of a mess?  I can straighten it out.  Just need a mirror, good as new.  Done it before.*  I hear a loud “fuck me.” And I start trying to get a good grip so I can straighten it when like 4 sets of hands grab me and make me stop. What the hell, I can’t have my nose any more crooked.  “Need to fix it, I’m already ugly enough.”

Crying.  Yelling. Another commotion.

“NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!  I WILL KILL THAT FUCKER!!!”

I think someone else just got attacked. Wonder who? 

*Oh hey, those guys look like EMTs. Oh crap. Someone got hurt. Wonder who?  Probably that guy that hit me.  Oh crap.  That is going to be paperwork and insurance and hey, why is one of them shining a light on my eyes one at a time?*  *Ouch. STOP THAT!!! Oh crap.  What is going on? Why is May signing like crazy?  She okay?  I really think she is perfect for Lemar. Oh wait..  Jackie is really angry. She is yelling at this rather good looking guy*. He has kind green eyes.  OH!!!   “Don’t yell at him, he’s cute. Cuter than Mark. He also has free coffee.  He helped me save your life.  Look, she’s okay!  You should date…”

I just got shushed by her!!!  *Wow. How brazen!*  She has her hands on the sides of her waist and is posed like some anime heroine that is going to beat the crap out of a bad guy. *Heh, a super curvy and busty Asuka.  She’s a Tsundere people, watch out!!*

*“*GOD DAMMIT PAT QUIT BROADCASTING!”  *Jackie’s yelling at me.  I hate that.*

*Oh shit. Sorry…* sorry. That better?  Heh. They won’t answer it if it is. Heheh.  Whoops. Everything is so fuzzy.

The EMT finally gives up. I think he says something about us being a couple.  A couple of what?  Oh? A stretcher?  For the hurt person!  Why am I… Oh?  Oh.   OHHH…!!!

The hurt person is me. 

I’m the hurt person. 

THE HURT PERSON IS ME?!?! 

I’m hurt?  Oh. Yea. Makes sense. Got it.  Wait.  Well fuck.  OH CONCUSSION!!!  Why didn’t I recognize this?  Been 6 years, guess you forget how they feel. Also, my jaw isn’t broken but hurting too. I know the difference.  That probably didn’t help. Oh*, and nose. Man, I really am a mess. I really gotta straighten…. Just grab it and…AWWWW COME ON LET ME FIX IT!  Why do they always stop me?  Gonna stay ugly if I can’t fix it.*

Lights. I see Jackie. She is telling me it will be alright.  *Of course it will.  Not like this is my first time going to the ER…. Hell, not even the first time for going in an ambulance after getting my nose broken and a concussion. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it’s happened twice…  I need a nap. Why is she crying like that while looking at me?  Pity?  Oh right, ugly gal with broken nose.  Poor girl. I hurt her so much. I need to touch her face, let her know I think I love… a nap…Yea. I need a nap? Oh, a sedative in IV… Nap time.*

 

More lights. Oh hey. I am laying on a bed. *This looks like an ER room.  See enough of them and they all look the same.   Jackie looks pissed and worried*.  There are pictures, no, X-rays? Yep, that’s my empty noggin. On the wall. The guy in the doctor’s coat is talking with Jackie. Wow. She is really worked up.  Thoughts are still a little… yea.

“Yes, she suffered a pretty bad concussion when her head hit the corner of that table after he punched her jaw. Punches like that can knock out the toughest people, so I understand why she went down that hard. Her broken nose is set now.  The hit was very hard. If he had hit her a few more times we wouldn’t be here. As I said before, we found some things that are… concerning.“

Jackie seems terrified. “What’s wrong?” I listen.

“I am not sure I can tell you now that she is conscious.” Guess he noticed?

“Like hell you can’t. She’s impaired and I have medical power of attorney. We are both single women and we figured if one got hurt the other would be faster to contact than my out of state parents or her non-existent family.”

“Look, there are signs of abuse… We would like to keep her for observation for the concussion.”

I finally pipe up. “Why?  Just stay hydrated, reduce screen time, no real activity for 2 days and then start light duty. Do some puzzles around the 2-day mark as well.”

The doctor looks at me.  “Had a few concussions before?”

“Less than a dozen. Probably.  Okay, probably not.  More than enough to leave him.”  He seems to get it.

Jackie inhales sharply.  This is still new to her. Still fresh. It is ancient history for me.

The doctor nods. He must have seen the healed fracture lines on my jaw, skull and probably neck. I look at the x-ray. Ah, that’s what healing looks like.

“If we hadn’t had a report of it being caused by a patron that is currently in a coma in the ICU, I would have thought to report whoever was your partner. Although I don’t think it could be this young lady.  And those are some old scars though.  I see at least 3 jaw fractures, one that required wiring it shut to heal, yes?”

I nod.  Jackie keeps trying not to sob.  She fails.

“He cracked your C5.  Any higher or worse could have led to paralysis.  The orbital fractures were done over years…  I am certain if we x-rayed your arms and chest we would see multiple fractures that are healed.  And then there is also what looks like a sharp force wound that indicates the weapon went through both sides of your arm.  Positioning indicates a defensive wound; he was trying to kill you.”  Jackie inhales and is fighting the tears.  She looks so hurt. I want to hug her.

*I WILL FUCKING KILL HIM!!!  HE WILL BURN AND SCREAM AND BEG ME TO PEE ON HIM TO PUT IT OUT AND I WILL PEE ON HIM AND IT WILL NOT GO OUT!!!!  HE WILL BEG FOR A DEATH THAT WILL TAKE HOURS!!!* 

Oh boy I heard her broadcasting. Pretty sure it was her. She is seething. The doctor looks at her and gets a surprised look. I think he figured out she knew none of this.

I nod. “None of that is wrong.  Wish I had you as a doc 7 years ago.  Might have left before the knife.  Can I go?”

He shakes his head. “I am still very worried about your pupil response.”

“You have already advised me on proper aftercare for a concussion, technically.  I am using up a valuable spot for someone that truly needs it.  All those wounds are more than 6 years old, from a different state, and from a person I will never see again.  I got out.  I wish I had someone that would have pushed like you seem to want to. Really. You noticed things 4 hospitals either didn’t bother seeing or didn’t bother trying to stop.  Thank you.”

He shakes his head.  He seems sad, and angry. Though that seems to ease his worries.  “I am going to let you check out. There are two police officers that want your statement.  They got your girlfriend’s statement already. 

In unison “We aren’t dating.”

He laughs and waves as he leaves. Fucker blew that off.

Jackie gets my few things and helps me up. I ask, “What would I do without you?”  *I am serious.* 

“Get held for days to try and convince you to leave your abuser?”  I look at her, puzzled.  “Not joking. They were going to use any excuse they could and see if they could find who did that.  I almost let them so I could go looking, but I realized I would just be driving around the south because I don’t know a thing about your past aside from Augusta Georgia within driving distance of some strip joints.”  The pain in her eyes hurts me.

“Besides, I made the decision for you that you would want and was best for you. Even if I don’t want to make it.”

*I love this woman.*

“It okay if I lean on you to walk?” 

“Can’t get enough?” Her smile is everything.

“Never can, and I don’t want to fall while talking to the cops.”

She laughs. “Let me get a wheelchair. More stable.”

My police statement is simple. “Told the customers to knock off the fight, got sucker punched, blinding pain, heard commotion. Lights, confusion, EMTs.  Woke up here.” 

Apparently three of the guests jumped the puncher because they thought he was going to finish me off. The “guy” he was fighting was the first to react and probably saved my life doing so.

The cops tell me that he looked pissed that I got in the way.  All his anger at the other guy got directed at me suddenly. 

The patrons didn’t kill him. But he will be less than happy living, that is if he ever wakes up out of the coma. I wonder who broke his neck.

The police thank me and watch me get wheeled away. I hear one whisper to the other “That redhead has blood under her nails and the perp has looooong gashes on his face that look awfully similar.” 

His partner responds, “Witnesses say it was defensive because he went after the vic after she was down and then swung at the redhead when she tried to stop him. Let that one be, I heard from Simmons she told the EMT she would …” The door closes before I find out what she was going to do.  Shame.  Of course she got a hit in. 

“What did you tell the EMTs?”

“I have power of attorney and was riding with you. They said no. I convinced them.”

I change my tone to annoyed mom, “Jackie, what did you say?”

“I would burn Manhattan down starting with their station if they tried to take you from me.  The one guy looked at me and then you.  Then you piped up about free coffee and him saving me and he got like an ‘AHA!’ moment and he said he” wouldn’t separate the miracle girl and her angel now that the roles of the couple are reversed,’ and he told me to get in.”

I don’t laugh. I am pretty sure she would burn the city down for me.  It scares me a little. I can sometimes see the flames all around her just when she is annoyed.  She would do it without a second thought. 

I debate going back to work.  No, probably not. But Jackie should be there.  “You should be at work.  I can get home on my own.”  I am a little wobbly, but I can manage.  I get shot down immediately.

“You might have brain damage.  I called Lemar, he came in and I will cover for him the day after tomorrow.  He got someone to finish your shift as well. He needs a raise. Lucky, I don’t have a shift tomorrow, so I can nurse you in bed all day.  We are going home, I am sticking you in my bed, and you are resting.”

I would argue, but I really am tired and all that sounds nice.  “Why your bed?”

“Because you will need lots of blankets for warmth and you sleep with like 1 sheet.  You will have a space heater that might actually manage to get to sleep tonight next to you because she is exhausted.  And, most importantly, my bedroom’s closer to the bathroom.”

“So, you really didn’t sleep last night?”  I am gently tossed into the back of a Taxi and Jackie gives the driver our address.

“Not a wink.” 

I want to ask why not, but I am going to need to be unconscious for a little bit to be able to get in the apartment.  That wins out. 

 

**May 25**

I wake up in bed.  I am wearing my PJs and Jackie is laying next to me, asleep.  She looks so innocent.  The look lies. She’s wearing conservative PJs. I knew she has them.  I almost chuckle.  I need to pee.  Disentangling myself from her takes a short bit.  I stagger to the bathroom, do my business.  Wash my hands.  Puke.  Wow, hell of a concussion.  Only ever puked twice before from them.  The bruises on my face are a bright purple.  They also take up more than half my face.  No amount of make up is covering this.  I know from experience.

I clean up again and then get a pair of arms around me.  She is looking up at me.  “You should shower.  I can start the water and get it ready for you.”

I am too exhausted to argue and just start stripping.  She does so as well.  I don’t quite get why until she is behind me and shivering like an idiot because 2 people in the shower is never actually sexy and always leaves someone cold.  She sits me down and that is a little better for her and for me.  She scrubs my back and gets me cleaned up.  She then helps me out and dries me off.  All business*.*

*I love this feeling of being pampered.* 

Fresh jammies and I am stuck in bed.  She leaves the room and comes back.  She makes me drink a couple of glasses of water. She changes into night wear of some sort.

*Why is she so good to me?*  

I nod off as she gets into the bed with me.  She says I take care of her…

I wake up and there is a bowl of still warm soup next to me.  I gratefully eat it.  Stomach appears okay.  The door chime rings and Jackie can be heard going to the door.

Voices.  Loud.  One gets closer.  Oberon appears at the doorway.  *How the hell does he know where we live?*  Oh yea, he’s been here, damn I am out of it…  *I am wearing completely unsexy clothes.  Jackie is in a black nightie that should NOT be worn in front of him.  Oh lord are they going to break the bed?*  They would have to use my bed or kick me out of this one… He walks up and touches my head.  He looks at the left side and I swear I hear a wolf snarling.  His hand is shaking.  I put my hand on his arm.  I think I know what he is about to do.  “Don’t!”

He nods.  *Oh good, maybe instead of killing some guy he will calm down and be a good boy and take off his shirt so I can go to sleep and have nice dreams*?

He and Jackie share a look.  “Did I say that out loud?”  They both laugh.  “Yes.”

“I ask you, Patricia Rae Wallace, for permission to assist you…”

I don’t think I can stop myself from saying yes, and I don’t want to anyway. “Sure.”

He starts unbuttoning his shirt.

I don’t get to enjoy the view before I am asleep.  Concussions fucking suck.

The bed is cramped.  Wait, this is a queen, Jackie’s bed, why is it…  OHMYFUCKINGGOD!  “OBERON WHY ARE YOU IN BED WITH ME AND JACKIE?!?!!?”

“I was tired.  You were wonderful.”

“Puck is the trickster, not you.  I know I didn’t do anything with you.”

He laughs.  “How do you know that?”

“I am still alive and feel like I am able to walk.” 

He laughs at my words.  “Got me there.  Alright, ladies, I think she is beyond the worst.  I shall take my leave.  Jackie, if you ever decide to quit, call on me soon after.  Cindy complimented your skills and she was impressive herself.”

Jackie is 5 shades redder than she has any right to be.  It’s hilarious and gorgeous. 

“You’d be the second, maybe third one I’d call.”

He laughs gets up, puts on a thong, and walks out, shirt over his shoulder.  Wait. He had to put it on… things were bad enough for me without seeing him in a banana hammock.  Again.  Wow. And he just put it on meaning…

“Care to explain… this?”  I look at my best friend.

“Fae can heal people simply by skin-to-skin contact, remember? Titania did it for me.  While he was here checking on you, I mentioned he would probably vibe with you. You did ask him to take off his shirt…”  She looks over at me and the happiest smile I have ever seen on her.  Oberon will do that…

“Skin to skin…?”  I check.  I am naked.   Of course I am naked.  *Fucking Oberon*.  And now Jackie is snuggling up to me.  So warm.  So soft.  So naked.  So sweet.  Wait…

“Jackie, you do not have Fae healing powers, right?”

“Not at all.”

“So why are you naked in this bed snuggling up to me?”

“Obie said it would help him.  It’s warm under the covers and you are soft.”  *All valid. Why do I feel like there’s more to it.*  It’s okay, she does make me feel better.  Speaking of, my head is fine.  I should be in the migraine phase and still wobbly right now.  I should also do some puzzles.

I grab my phone.  *She put it on the nightstand, sweet of her.*  I work in 4 hours.  Hold up, I have been in and out of consciousness for 2 days. I can manage it.  I pull up a sudoku and start working on it.  Jackie snuggles in more, half asleep, and I have to move a hand that is brushing up where it shouldn’t.  I finish the sudoku, decide I need to get moving and get up.  Move another hand where it shouldn’t be. Wait, that was there for a while and I kinda… need to stop that thought.

Ugh, the air gets cold this early in the morning, even in late May. Little chilly, I stretch, hear a sigh from the bed, go to grab some clothes and get my hand smacked. 

“The fuck you think you are doing?”  Wow, she looks mad. 

I show her my phone.  “I have work in 3 hours.” 

“And I have it in 2 for Lemar.  The difference is that I will be going to work and you are on bed rest until further notice.  I have Beth coming over in 30.  She is making sure you don’t do something stupid.  Lay down and rest.”  

“Yes ma’am.” *So sweet.*

 

**May 29**

I get to work and I am greeted by May and Connie.  May is signing at 300 motions a second or something insane and I cannot keep up.  I sign for her to slow down because “I am sorry I am not quite this good.”  She gets a look and hugs me, crying.  She starts over, slowly.  “The Hobgoblin is being held until you can go to Court.  There is a disagreement over which Court gets to punish him.”

I stagger a little there.  “Okay, I will see what I can do after work.  Thanks.” My signing has gotten to the point where most consider me fluent.  As I go to leave I see her sign to Connie, “Did you see her face?  I feel pain looking at it.” 

Connie responds with something that chills me far more.  “Did you see her arm?”  At that moment I realize that for the first time in ages, I am wearing short sleeves to work.

Fuck.  I just came in to sign some paperwork I can’t do electronically and because I was bored working at home. 

Jackie comes in for her shift and we will be going home together.  I see her staring at my arm.  I wonder if I have a jacket or long sleeve shirt in my office.  It won’ matter, except it will remove the distraction.  I can feel her winding herself up as the day goes on. Even at home I wear long sleeves. This is why.

Oberon comes in.  Waves.  His smile is comically happy.  I have been working the drive thru to help and to avoid looks when it comes to my face.  I almost went for the kitchen.  When he gets in front of the counter Jackie comes and tells me he would like to talk to me specifically for a minute.  Walking up I just get it over with.  “Thank you.”  He laugh and touches my cheek where it is still a little raw. 

“I am only angry I could not stop it.”  I nod.  I know he is likely the reason the Summer Court is pushing to hold the Hobgoblin responsible as it would normally fall under Winter Court because it is an unseelie.

“I have to go.”  He grabs my left arm and examines the scar.  “This is what I wanted to speak of with you.  I saw it while assisting you.  I have seen such a wound on a mortal that defended themselves from an attacker with a short stabbing sword.” 

I nod.  “Good eye, kitchen butcher’s knife. He got kicked in the nuts and I got away, obviously.”  He nods.  I can feel rage boiling up all around me.  I look around.  Jackie and Ron are both staring at me.  Jackie is still mad.  I can feel Ron being sad?  Angry?  Why?  I am just his boss.  Guess he is just a good guy. Nice. But this needs to stop.

“Alright, let’s stop this little melodrama.  My life is way different right now and I am not going to tell you all my tragic backstory while in the lobby of a coffee shop.  Back to work, people.”  I clap twice

Oberon grabs my hand. “You are truly a warrior queen.  I will see you tonight?”  I nod.

We 4 are all in close proximity to eachother like it’s a huge office with multiple rooms for different teams. These are the issues i face.

• The Serial Burper My coworker (who replaced me in my old role — poetic) burps loudly and often. Full-bodied, echoing-from-the-soul burps. But wait — after every burp, she says “praise the Lord.” I’ll literally give her a look like “ma’am, please”, and she just… does it again. Like she’s casting spells.

• Coughs like a plague widow Same woman. Loud coughing fits, no attempt to cover. We’re talking deep, guttural coughing — like a Victorian orphan in her final act.

• Toenail clipping The lady next to me clipped her toenails under her desk. I couldn’t see it, but I could hear it. That tiny click… click… click haunts me. Like ASMR from hell.

• Shawarma at 9AM In a 3-person office. The garlic. The onion. The audacity. It’s a full-sensory assault before I’ve even had my coffee.

• The Mouth Sound Demon Back when I was in the procurement office, there was this dude who made these wet, slurping, kissing noises while eating or picking his teeth. It legit sounded like he was making out with himself. I complained. They moved me to a different office. But one day while in my new space, I heard his mouth sounds through the hallway walls. That man’s lips need to be declared a weapon of mass destruction.

• Also — they speak and laugh so loudly, like they’re in a market stall, not a tiny corporate office.

I can see where some might not want to do this because of the risk of falling back asleep.

**Abstract Rugs and Carpets** have become a sought-after choice in home décor, bringing a fresh and contemporary twist to traditional designs. With their bold patterns, vibrant colors, and dynamic designs, abstract rugs in India are taking over interior design trends, adding style, personality, and sophistication to any space.[**Abstract Carpet** ](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor)Whether it's a living room, bedroom, or study, these rugs effortlessly blend modern aesthetics with comfort and functionality. In this article, we will explore the appeal of abstract rugs in India, the diverse varieties available, their benefits, and how they can transform your living spaces.

# What Are Abstract Rugs?

An **abstract rug** is a rug that features non-representational or non-figurative designs. Unlike traditional rugs that often display floral patterns, geometric shapes, or scenes, abstract rugs prioritize artistic and experimental designs, often with a focus on color, texture, and form. These rugs are ideal for individuals seeking to add an artistic flair to their homes. With abstract rugs, the design is less about representing real-life objects and more about evoking emotions, creating moods, and adding depth to the space.

# The Rise of Abstract Rugs in India

Over the past decade, the popularity of abstract rugs has soared in India. Traditionally, Indian homes favored intricately woven carpets with detailed motifs and religious or cultural symbols. However, as global design influences seep into Indian interiors, homeowners are increasingly leaning towards contemporary and minimalist aesthetics. Abstract rugs offer a way to incorporate modern design without compromising on the rich tradition of craftsmanship.

India, with its vibrant culture, diverse artistic influences, and appreciation for fine craftsmanship, has seen a growing interest in abstract and modern rugs. From the bustling streets of Delhi to the serene coastal homes in Goa, abstract rugs have found a place in homes across the country, transforming interiors into art-filled spaces.

# The Appeal of Abstract Rugs in India

# . Versatility in Design

Abstract rugs are incredibly versatile in terms of design. Whether you are looking for bold and vibrant colors or subtle, muted tones, there is an abstract rug to suit every style. From circular and wave-like patterns to sharp, jagged lines and asymmetrical shapes, abstract rugs can create various moods depending on the space they are placed in.

For example, in a minimalist or modern space, a black-and-white abstract rug can create a striking focal point. In a more traditional room, a rug with splashes of red, orange, and gold can complement the existing décor while introducing a contemporary touch.

# . Customization Options

A key advantage of abstract rugs is the ability to customize designs. Many rug manufacturers and designers offer made-to-order rugs where the size, shape, color, and design are tailored according to the buyer’s preferences. This level of customization allows homeowners to get a rug that perfectly complements their living space, creating a more personalized and cohesive interior design.

# . Elevating Aesthetic Appeal

Abstract rugs can instantly elevate the aesthetic appeal of a room. These rugs are typically designed to create a visual statement, drawing attention without overwhelming the space. The contrast of colors, the fluidity of patterns, and the play with textures bring dynamism into any room. Whether placed under a coffee table in the living room or at the foot of a bed, these rugs enhance the overall atmosphere and tie together the entire room.

# . Comfort and Functionality

Beyond their visual appeal, abstract rugs also provide comfort and functionality. They offer a soft surface for walking, sitting, and playing, which is particularly beneficial for families with young children. The addition of a rug can help to define different areas within a room, especially in open-concept spaces. Rugs can also contribute to better acoustics by reducing sound echo, making a room feel warmer and cozier.

# . Durability and Easy Maintenance

When buying an abstract rug, especially online in India, durability and maintenance are important considerations. While traditional rugs might require more delicate care, modern abstract rugs, especially those made from synthetic fibers, are often more durable and easier to clean. These rugs can handle heavy foot traffic and are ideal for homes with children and pets.

# Types of Abstract Rugs in India

Abstract rugs come in a variety of materials, designs, and styles. Let’s look at some popular options available online in India:

# . Wool Abstract Rugs

Wool is a natural fiber known for its softness, warmth, and durability. Wool abstract rugs are some of the most luxurious types of rugs available. These rugs have a rich texture that adds a touch of sophistication to any room. Whether you’re looking for bold, geometric patterns or a more organic, flowing design, wool abstract rugs provide a timeless appeal. Wool is also stain-resistant, making these rugs a practical choice for high-traffic areas.

#  . Cotton Abstract Rugs

Cotton rugs are soft, breathable, and often more affordable than their wool counterparts. They come in a range of colors and designs, including those with abstract patterns. Cotton abstract rugs are particularly popular in modern homes because they are lightweight and easy to move around. They are also machine-washable, making them ideal for spaces that need frequent cleaning, like kitchens or children’s playrooms.

#  . Silk Abstract Rugs

For an added layer of luxury, silk abstract rugs offer a shimmering finish that enhances the overall aesthetic of the room. The reflective quality of silk enhances the vibrancy of the rug’s colors, making them stand out even more. These rugs are often used as statement pieces in living rooms or areas where they can be showcased as a work of art. However, silk rugs tend to be more delicate, so they require careful handling and regular cleaning.

#  . Polyester and Nylon Abstract Rugs

Synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon have become increasingly popular due to their durability, stain resistance, and ease of cleaning. These rugs are affordable, making them an excellent choice for budget-conscious buyers.[**Abstract Rugs Online India**](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor)**.** While they may lack the luxurious feel of natural fibers, synthetic abstract rugs often have intricate patterns and vibrant colors that can mimic the appearance of traditional wool or silk rugs. Polyester and nylon rugs are perfect for high-traffic areas or homes with pets.

#  . Jute and Hemp Abstract Rugs

For a more eco-friendly option, jute and hemp abstract rugs offer a rustic, earthy aesthetic. The natural fibers used in these rugs provide a unique texture, and their neutral tones complement a variety of modern décor styles. These rugs are sustainable, biodegradable, and offer a natural charm to any home.

# Where to Buy Abstract Rugs Online in India?

With the rise of online shopping, purchasing abstract rugs in India has never been easier. Several platforms offer a wide range of options, allowing customers to browse through various designs, materials, and sizes. Some popular online stores include:

* **Amazon India**: Amazon offers a vast selection of abstract rugs, ranging from affordable synthetic options to premium wool and silk designs.  
* **Urban Ladder**: Known for its modern home furniture and décor, Urban Ladder offers an assortment of contemporary abstract rugs, focusing on quality and design.

* **Home Centre**: With its extensive home décor collection, Home Centre offers stylish abstract rugs that blend with both traditional and contemporary interiors.  

# Choosing the Right Abstract Rug for Your Space

When selecting an abstract rug for your home, there are several factors to consider to ensure you get the perfect piece:

#  . Size

The size of the rug should be proportionate to the space in which it will be placed. In living rooms, choose a rug that is large enough to cover the seating area but doesn’t overwhelm the space. In bedrooms, a smaller rug placed near the bed can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

#  . Color Palette

Choose a rug color that complements the overall color scheme of the room. Bold and contrasting colors can create a focal point, while muted tones can help to blend the rug into the background. Neutral colors like beige, grey, and white work well in minimalist rooms, while vibrant hues like red, blue, or yellow can energize the space.

#  . Material

Consider the material of the rug based on the level of foot traffic in the area. Wool and silk rugs are perfect for living rooms or areas with less foot traffic, while cotton, polyester, and jute are more suitable for kitchens, hallways, or children's rooms.

#  . Maintenance

Abstract rugs made from synthetic fibers or natural fibers like jute are generally easier to maintain. If you prefer a low-maintenance option, go for synthetic fibers or cotton, which are machine washable.

# Conclusion

Abstract rugs are a fantastic way to bring modern design and creative energy into your Indian home. Whether you’re looking for something bold and colorful or subtle and sophisticated, there is an abstract rug for every style and space[.**Abstract Rugs**](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor) By investing in an abstract rug, you not only enhance the visual appeal of your home but also add warmth, comfort, and functionality.

	•	Christine: My least favorite. All she did was complain and drink wine. Rarely said anything kind to anyone. Her food was unremarkable, and she always seemed to just throw things together last minute with no plan.

	•Ben Starr: Total sweetheart and a genuinely good cook. I was rooting for him to make the finals with Alejandra. A joy to watch!

	•	Esther: Okay overall. I don’t blame her for saving herself in pressure tests, but she didn’t do anything memorable either. Pretty forgettable.

	•	Derrick: Underrated. He was good and had potential to go much further.

	•	Alvin: Don’t get why the judges hyped him up so much and he was just okay. Nothing wow-worthy.

Today in Samut Sakhon, I experienced something I never expected while volunteering at a school. My friend and I are Myanmar Master’s students, spending our semester break doing volunteer work. During lunch, we stopped by Everyday 1990 Cafe for coffee, then waited for our Grab motorbike at a junction nearby to go back to the school.

Out of nowhere, the man in a white shirt in the photos came up and started shouting at us and told us to sit down. We didn’t understand what was going on. We tried to ask them to explain using Google Translate. He pushed me hard, shouted again, and asked, “Where are you from?”

My friend panicked, showed her student card, and said we are Myanmar students from this university. As soon as they heard “Myanmar,” things got worse. They started shouting Thai phrases including “Myanmar.” We didn’t fully understand, but we could feel the racism clearly.

More and more people gathered. Around 20 people, taking photos of our faces, filming our student cards, even doing Facebook Live. But when we tried to record them back, they wouldn’t let us. We kept asking through Google Translate what the problem was. They didn’t answer and just kept shouting. Then, a local girl nearby finally told us there had been a theft at the small juice shop in front of us. They thought we were involved. (P.S. We didn’t even walk past that shop!)

Even when I tried to ask again, the white tshirt man pushed me again and this time, he even tried to punch me‼️ It was just the two of us, surrounded by a crowd of around 20 people. We chose to stay calm and called our professor at the school, who is French. 

While waiting, I saw them hit another person inside the juice shop. That’s when I realized they already caught the real thief yet they still didn’t care about what they did to us.

When our professor arrived, the moment they saw he is a foreigner, everything changed. The same people who had shouted and pushed us suddenly apologized but only to him. Not a single word to us.

Honestly, it was painful. We were treated like criminals just because we are Myanmar.

I really wanted to call the police, but we had to return to the school to finish our tasks and didn’t want to make things bigger. I just wanted to share this here, so people know racism like this is real and getting worse in Thailand.

This is the location where everything happened.

What if you can’t find a decent job…

You get out of school and go to uni, work in an outbound call centre to make some money, it’s the only terrible place that will take anyone. 

Ok you finish uni, you apply for jobs in your qualified field…can’t get an entry level job in your field. 

You search for years but no one will hire you.
Okay, while you’re searching you pickup a menial/low paying job that is mildly enjoyable…making coffee.

What if you still can’t get hired in your field? You apply for 100s of positions, get a few interviews, no one hires you.

Now the job that you took out of desperation (making coffee) is your most trained and experienced position. So you seek better employment in that industry. The cycle repeats, apply for 100s of positions. But yet…you can’t get a job.

Now you’re no longer even looking for a job in your original field, you’re only looking to progress yourself in the coffee industry. Nobody. will. hire. you.

You’re stuck in the same position for years, on the same wage, with no opportunity to grow. Because no one will hire you for a better position.

1m302wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoWeKnowThemPodcast/comments/1m302wh/office_siren_an_explanation/,Office Siren- an explanation,"I know this episode came out a few months ago but I'm rewatching and while I love the girlies, it's bothering me so bad that neither know what OS is. So I'm here to explain- 

The idea of OS is to be sexy in office wear. Think 50 Shades of Grey, The Secretary, etc. It's mainly a fantasy and plays into (usually) the male fantasy of dominating one of two working archetypes- the 'strong working woman' (female lawyer for example) or the 'sexy assistant/receptionist'. For example, Oliva Benson is considered an office siren because she's hot and wears 'OS' clothing and she fits into the 'strong independent working woman' trope.  

The OS glasses seems to stem from Bayonetta and, ironically, Jo Frost from Supernanny (a british tv show about a nanny). The Bayonetta aspect comes from the fact that she's very conventionally attractive and wears the smaller framed glasses and Jo Frost because she wears office wear and looks good (dresses for her body) whilst also being professional. 

The OS trend got big during the pandemic where people were working from home but wanted to dress up and look 'nice' as a way of forcing themselves out of their pjs for working from home. It then became bastardised and a tiktok trend where people started wearing tight leather and more revealing clothing whilst not actually going to work. I've also seen it being called 'assistant core'- basically wearing OS clothing out to get coffee.

I'm sorry if this post is redundant haha I just need to educate to girlies.",2,1752838990.0,DoWeKnowThemPodcast,1,0.6,False
1m302j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1m302j9/paper_wasps/,Paper Wasps,"It started off with a cry every parent has heard a hundred times before.

“Daaad! There’s someone in my room!”

It was one AM, maybe 2 AM? There was certainly not anyone in Des’s room. The house was locked, his bedroom was on the second story. But I went to look anyway, because even though obviously there was no one there, obviously it was a nightmare—what if it wasn’t?

That’s the real nightmare for every parent. What if this one time your child was screaming and you didn’t hurry over, but it turned out to finally be important? There are always stories of accidents and abductions. All the logic in the world wouldn’t fix the guilt if something was truly wrong and you didn’t go check.

So I hauled myself out of bed, waving my wife Petra back to sleep. I stumbled down the hall in my pajama bottoms and swung Des’s door open. The hallway light fell on his bed, where he was huddled under the covers.

“Dude. What?” I wasn’t at my most articulate.

“He’s in the corner! A giant!”

I turned to look. “There’s noth—holy chemise!”

Parental reflexes are funny things. In about a half a second, the situation unfolded like this: first, I saw a huge, swollen face leering down from me from the corner of the room, just like Des had said. Second, I ran—not for the hallway, but for the bed, where I grabbed Desmond in a giant fabric bundle. Only then did I sprint for the hallway.

And third, I somehow corrected myself from swearing in the middle of that, so that my seven year old wouldn’t learn a word that he’d probably already heard at school. And had *definitely* already heard from my brother.

The blankets in my arms were screaming.

“Daddy! It’s got me! Help meee!”

I’d like to say that I said something comforting or smart, but apparently I’d burned through my store of good parental choices in that first maneuver. Instead, I rolled the entire bundle as far down the hallway toward my room as I could and barked, “Go get your mother!”

I had no weapon. I didn’t even have a shirt on. I was going to have to face this thing alone.

I took a deep breath and kicked the door all the way open.

“All right, creep—”

Only there wasn’t a creep. As the door slammed back into the wall, the light fully illuminated the corner of the room. There was nobody in the corner, literally no body. What I had thought was a head was a large papery mass stuck up against the ceiling, an oblong maybe a foot across and almost two feet long.

I let out a short laugh as I realized how silly I’d been. In the light, it didn’t look anything like a person. It was probably just—

All the adrenaline flooded back in. I grabbed the door handle and yanked it shut. I heard it tear free from where it had smashed through the drywall, and splinter as I slammed it into its frame. I staggered back against the far wall.

“What? What is it?” My wife was at the end of the hall, untangling our son from his involuntary cocoon. She looked as panicked as I felt.

“Give me those blankets!” I demanded. “Wasp nest!”

She blinked in confusion, but at least she lifted Desmond out of the way as I grabbed frantically for his comforter and stuffed it against the crack beneath his bedroom door.

“What? How?” she asked.

“I don’t know! I don’t know.” My adrenaline crashed for a second time in a single minute. I suddenly felt lightheaded, like I might pass out. The blankets were in place. The door was sealed. As long as I didn’t fall into it and knock it open, it would be okay. “Open window, I guess.”

“It’s December!”

I didn’t have the wherewithal to argue. “Look, I don’t know. I’ll figure it out tomorrow.”

“What about Desi?”

“He’s gonna have to sleep with us. I’m not fighting wasps in the middle of the night.” I steadied myself with a hand on the wall as I walked back down the hallway. “Babe, you should’ve seen this thing. Twice the size of my head, taking up half the wall.”

“Maybe more,” said Des.

Petra looked at both of us skeptically. “Well, we’ll see in the morning, I guess. Come on, everybody into bed.”

As I laid back down, I wondered if Petra was right not to believe us. That nest certainly hadn’t been there when I put Des to bed last night. Were wasps even active at night?

My last thought before I fell asleep was that if they were, we’d better hope that they didn’t realize my barrier under the door was only cloth.

I dreamed of wings and stingers. When my phone alarm went off in the morning, I flinched awake at the very first buzz. I crept cautiously into the hallway, ready to retreat, but the blanket was still tucked against Des’s door and there were no wasps to be seen.

I peeled a corner of the blanket away and crouched down to listen carefully beneath the door. The room was silent. A hive that size would have some sort of noise if it were active, surely. If the wasps were all out foraging or whatever wasps did, it might be safe to knock the nest down and seal up whatever window or vent had allowed them inside.

“What are you doing?”

I jumped in surprise, with enough force to crack my head on the door. The hollow thunk elicited a laugh from my wife, who had apparently also woken up and was now standing above me, amused at the reaction to her simple question.

“I’m trying to decide if it’s safe to go in there,” I said. “Do we have any sort of full body suit? Like a beekeeper getup?”

“Oh, it can’t be that bad,” said Petra. She reached over me and before I could stop her, she swung the door open.

I heard her gasp and I scrambled to my feet, scrabbling to slam the door .

“It’s fine, it’s fine, there’s no wasps!” said Petra, grabbing my wrists. Her eyes were fixed on the far wall. “I’ve never seen anything like that nest, though. Wow!”

It was somehow more ominous in the daytime. It still gave the vague impression of a face, a papier mache death mask for a giant. Its rough construction was more obvious now. The imperfections made it more threatening. It did not look like art. It looked like a curse.

As Petra had said, there were no wasps anywhere to be seen. That at least was a relief.

“How do you think they made it so quickly?” she asked.

“All I care about is how quickly I can get rid of it,” I told her. “I’m thinking fire might be necessary.”

“What? Absolutely not. Be careful when you take it down.”

“We can repaint! It’ll be fine.”

“I’m not worried about the walls! I want that nest.”

“You’re crazy! I’m not risking my life because you want some creepy bug house.”

“Fine, then I’ll get it down.”

“No!” I heaved a sigh as Petra stared me down challengingly. “Just—hang out for a few minutes. We have a bug bomb in the garage, I think.”

Several minutes of fruitless searching let me know that we did not have a bug bomb in the garage. I came back to let Petra know the bad news.

“Babe, I’m gonna have to—what are you doing?!”

She was coming out of the doorway of Des’s room, the hideous nest cradled in her arms. She gave me a look that was half guilty, half triumphant.

“I got it down. It was empty!” She gave it a little shake to prove this.

“Well, that’s pretty lucky, isn’t it? You know what could have happened if you’d been swarmed by that many wasps?”

“We couldn’t have thrown that poison in there anyway. All of Des’s stuff is in there. All of his toys would have had to be thrown out. Anyway, look at this!”

“I’d really rather not.”

“No, look what it’s made out of! It’s got newsprint in it! Look, you can read words!”

She was right. The nest was covered in printed type and bits of black-and-white pictures. The words were stuck on at all sorts of angles, little scraps glued together with no rhyme or reason. There were columns and headline fragments jammed over top of each other.

“Great, so we’ve got literate wasps. I’ll put up a sign that says NO TRESPASSING so they don’t come back.”

“I don’t know how you don’t think this is amazing.”

“I think we need to get Des ready for school before I have to go to work, and I want to find how those things got in before they come back.”

Petra gave me a brief pout, but she put the nest aside and went back to our room to wake Desmond up. For my part, I checked the windows and vents in his room, but could find no sign that anything was open to the outside. I wasn’t comfortable leaving it at that, but I didn’t have time for a more thorough search around the exterior of the house. I made a plan to check after work, and if I still couldn’t find anything, we could just seal up his room again until we had time to call an exterminator.

All of the extra activity put me slightly behind schedule, so I wasn’t happy to enter the kitchen and hear Des arguing about whether or not he had to eat breakfast.

“You gotta eat something, bud,” I told him, pouring myself a mug of coffee. “Come on, we’re gonna be late.”

“I don’t want to!” he complained. I sighed and grabbed a breakfast bar to feed him in the car. It would be better than nothing.

I thought he ate it on the way to school, but after I dropped him off, I saw it sliding around the back seat of the car, still wrapped. He must have hidden it under his car seat. Kids can find the most amazing ways to cause problems for themselves.

It wasn’t a total surprise when I got a call from the school to come pick him up around lunchtime. Between the sleep interruption and skipping breakfast, I’d have been more surprised if he had made it through the school day. They said he had a slight fever, but mainly he just wanted to lie down. I made my excuses to my boss and ducked out to go retrieve Des.

“Rough day?” I asked him as we walked from the nurse’s office.

“I don’t feel very good.”

“Well, that’s why you need to eat breakfast like your mom was telling you this morning. That breakfast bar’s still in the car if you want it now.”

“I don’t want it. I want a nap.”

I thought about the unsolved problem of the wasps. “Hey, how about we put you in mommy and daddy’s bed for that nap?”

“No! I want my room.” He looked uncharacteristically on the verge of a tantrum, so I let it drop. I figured there was a decent chance he’d be asleep by the time we got back anyway, and if he wasn’t, we could have that argument then.

Unfortunately, Des was still awake when we pulled into the garage. I was mentally gearing up for a fight with a tired seven year old when we walked into the kitchen and I totally lost my train of thought.

Petra was sitting at the table. The wasp nest was in a large bowl next to her, glistening wet. It looked more like a leering face than ever.

“Look!” said Petra.

Scraps of wet paper covered the kitchen table. It looked like a jigsaw puzzle made out of trash.

“Have you been…peeling that nest?”

Behind me, Des dropped his book bag on the floor and trundled off to his room to lie down. Neither of us noticed him go.

“Look at this! It’s a newspaper,” said Petra.

“Yeah, you said that this morning.”

“But look at the date!”

She had found a piece of the header. It had today’s date on it.

“So? We found it toda—wait, how early do they deliver the papers? That thing was fully formed by like 2 AM.”

“That isn’t today’s date. It’s TOMORROW’S.”

“Oh.” I lost interest. “From like last year? So they just got into some old papers somewhere.”

“It says the right day of the week,” she insisted. “So unless that paper is like thirty years old, it’s from tomorrow.”

“That doesn’t make any sen—”

“I’ve got part of the sports page. Are these two teams playing tonight?”

“Yeah, bu—”

“And look, here’s half a paragraph about a town council meeting. I looked it up. It’s happening this afternoon.”

“But—it can’t—” I sputtered, looking for words. “What does this mean?”

“I’ll tell you what it means.” Petra pointed to a specific cluster of newsprint, her eyes shining. “It means we’re going to be rich.”

The paper was crumpled, torn in inconvenient places and translucent from the water. Still, the header was clear enough: POWERBALL.

Below, assembled from various scraps, were four two-digit numbers.

“The other two are in here somewhere,” Petra said. “All we have to do is find them. Hundreds of millions of dollars. But we have to do it today.”

It was crazy. It made no sense.

“I can’t believe this,” I told her.

“Thought you might say that. Here, look at this one.”

It was a larger scrap, a nearly complete paragraph describing a hit-and-run on a pedestrian. It listed the intersection and the time.

“Hasn’t happened yet, right?” said Petra. “Go see. You’ll see that I’m right.”

“You’re nuts,” I said, but I went.

As I approached the intersection, I kept my eyes peeled. I still didn’t believe Petra, but if somehow she was right, I knew how this stuff worked in movies. I’d be the guy who caused the hit and run. Or the pedestrian who got hit. Either way, it would only have happened because I’d seen the prediction. I wasn’t interested in getting involved in any time loop shenanigans.

I parked carefully. I turned off my car. I stayed inside.

It wasn’t a busy intersection, but every time someone crossed the road, I tensed up. Was this it? Each time they crossed safely, I let out the breath I’d been holding, and then checked my watch. The minutes were creeping by. It was always too early.

I was checking my watch again, certain that the time had passed without incident, when I suddenly heard squealing brakes and a hard crunch. I leapt out of my car to see a person crumpled against the side of a parked car and a green Nissan speeding off. I should have paid attention to the license plate, but I was too shocked by the fact that the accident had happened at all. It was exactly as the newspaper fragment had described.

People were already running over to help. No one needed me there. I was afraid of getting involved, of changing anything. My hands were shaking as I started the car. Petra was right. Somewhere in the layers of that nest were the other two numbers. More than half a billion dollars, and all we had to do was uncover it.

I had to get home to help. We had less than eight hours until the entries closed.

I burst back into the house with a breathless, “Have you found any more?”

“So it happened, huh? Believe me now?”

“Yes.” I pulled up a chair next to her. “Intangible wasps built a nest in our son’s room using a paper that hasn’t been printed yet. And somehow I believe that. Did you find any more of the numbers?”

“Not yet. I was thinking though, even if we can’t find any more, that’s only like five thousand options for the two we don’t know. We could buy one of each to make sure.”

“Only five thousand? That’s ten thousand dollars. We don’t have that on hand.”

“We can figure it out!” Her eyes blazed as she looked at me. “We can borrow it at 100% interest per day and still come out so far ahead that we’ll never even notice it. I’m not saying I want to. There are probably systems in place that flag that sort of buying behavior. But if it comes down to it, we’ll risk it.”

She was right, of course. Still, it would be much better if we could just find those other numbers.

“Okay, how do I peel pieces off of this?” I asked.

“Let me do it, I’ve got nails. You sort through the pieces over there. Make sure you check both sides.”

We rapidly fell into a rhythm. She gently bathed the nest in warm water, loosening the scraps that had been used to make it, then teased off the individual scraps to pass to me. I checked them over for numbers, discarding anything that was just words or pictures. The numbers got set aside to dry, waiting for Petra to check through them while the next level of scraps was slowly soaking free of the nest.

I heard Des call out for me at one point, but as I rose from the table to see how he was doing, a scrap caught my eye. It had a partial circle near the top with the bottom part of a W. Below it, at the bottom of the fragment, was the number 39.

“Daddy?” Des called again.

“Be right there, bud,” I said. I moved the scrap slowly toward the others, as if I thought sudden movements might scare the numbers away. The circled W at the top fit into the Powerball logo. The number at the bottom was one of the two we were missing.

“Got one!” I shouted. Petra threw her arms around me in a wet hug. Small pieces of newsprint clung to her nails. I hugged her back, but I watched those scraps anxiously. If any fell on the floor, I wanted to know where they had gone.

Hours passed. The nest shrank and shrank. It no longer resembled a head. Now it looked like a misshapen heart. I could hear how hollow it was under Petra’s gentle handling. We were getting close to the final layers.

“What if there are eggs in there?” I asked. “Or larva, or whatever wasps have. What if we open it up and there’s a queen?”

“I don’t think wasps have queens.”

“Don’t act like that’s the part of this that doesn’t make sense! What if there’s something horrible in the center and we let it out?”

As I said that, one of Petra’s nails pierced the final layer. She jerked her hand back and tore away a thick strip of newsprint with it. I flinched back instinctively, but although the internal cavity was large enough for a small dog, it was completely empty. There was nothing at all inside.

Petra let out a shaky breath. “Well! Answered that question, I guess.”

I wasn’t listening to her anymore. My gaze was fixed on the piece of paper dangling from her hand. It bore the circled P of Powerball. If it was a large enough scrap, it might have the final number at the bottom. I couldn’t see the number on it, but it looked like it might be big enough.

“Give me your hand,” I said. Petra watched as I peeled the wet newsprint away like sunburnt skin. I put it on the table almost reverently.

“Is that it?” she asked.

“That’s all six,” I said. “Tonight’s Powerball numbers. That’s all of them.”

We stared at them for a moment. I felt a mix of awe and fear. This didn’t feel real. I’d seen the accident, though. This was future information. This was going to change everything.

“We have to go buy a ticket,” Petra whispered. “There’s only a couple of hours left.”

We both went. I think we both had the feeling that if we let the other one out of our sight, the whole impossible idea might collapse. We checked the numbers a dozen times as we put them into the machine. Two dollars was such an insanely small amount to exchange for a slip of paper that was going to be worth so much.

I half-expected the nest to be gone when we got home, but it was still there, torn apart and spread all over our kitchen table.

“You’d better clean this up if you want to have dinner,” Petra said. Her mouth suddenly opened into an O of shock. “Desmond! Poor baby hasn’t eaten anything all day, and we let him sleep through dinner!”

“I’ll go see if he wants anything,” I said. I shuffled down the hall and knocked gently on his door. “Des? Buddy? You awake?”

There was no answer, though I did hear a quiet drone like a sustained snore.

I eased the door open. The light fell across the bed.

Desmond’s eyes were closed. His mouth was hanging open. The purple sheets were bunched up over his body and moving strangely, as if he was running his hands up and down underneath.

*Des’s sheets are blue*, I thought. My mind would go no further, though I already knew the truth. I could see where the sheets were blue at the bottom, could see where the purple was thickest and shining its true red in the light from the hallway.

I stepped robotically inside the room. Desmond did not move. The sheets continue to writhe and pulse.

I reached down. I took hold of a corner. I pulled them aside.

Wasps. Thousands, tens of thousands. They flew up in a cloud, boiling out of the red ruin of Des’s belly. Their wingbeats droned frantically as they escaped the confines of the blankets and flew—neither at me nor away, but rather, away from everything. They grew smaller and smaller, disappearing down a long hallway without changing position at all.

I heard Petra scream behind me as the last of the wasps vanished. I saw the Powerball ticket fall from her hand as she rushed across the floor to the torn and chewed body of our son. I heard her sobs, great racking cries of loss and guilt.

I looked at the blood on my hands. I looked at the ticket on the floor. The numbers would be valid, I knew. Just as I knew that tomorrow’s newspaper would be chewed to pieces to make a nest.

I intended to keep that newspaper as close to me as possible. Whenever the wasps came for it, however they arrived, I would kill as many of them as I could.

I couldn’t change anything. The Powerball numbers would win. But the wasp nest had been hollow.

Maybe I would be able to deny them something.

1m300ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Help_yourBrain/comments/1m300ts/best_essay_writing_service_review_is/,Best Essay Writing Service Review: Is EssayEagle.net Actually Worth It?,"Alright, story time.

It was 2am. I was halfway through a bag of stale chips, staring at a blank Google Doc titled: “Impact of globalization on local economies.” The only thing globalizing at that moment was my anxiety.

Desperate, I typed “best paper writing services reddit” into the search bar — and somehow, I landed on[ EssayEagle.net](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252). I’d never heard of it before. No big-budget ads. No spammy pop-ups. Just a clean site and some decent-looking reviews.

I figured, if it crashes and burns, at least I’ll go down trying.

Spoiler: it didn’t.

# 🦅 EssayEagle.net — First Impressions

The site layout? Surprisingly slick. Not 2005-web-forum vibes like half the so-called [top rated essay writing services](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) out there. It’s minimal, direct, and doesn’t scream “scam” at first glance — always a good sign.

Ordering was easy:

* I chose the essay type (6 pages, argumentative, due in 48 hours).
* Entered the topic + some chaotic notes I’d been avoiding for a week.
* Picked a writer level (went with “premium” because I was not in the mood for surprises).
* Paid with card. No hidden fees. No shady redirects.  

# Delivery & Quality

The paper arrived 6 hours before the deadline — flex. Formatting? Spot on (APA done right, which is rare). Language? Polished, but not suspiciously perfect — like something I might write on 3 cups of coffee and 4 hours of sleep.

There was a solid structure, legit sources (I checked), and the writer actually made a coherent argument. Wild, I know.

I even asked for one small revision (I’d forgotten to mention a source), and they got it back to me in under 3 hours. Respect.

**Why It Stands Out**

Here’s what makes EssayEagle sneak into my top 10 essay writing services list:

* **Real communication**: You can chat with the writer. Mine asked if I had sample papers to match tone. That’s next-level.
* **Originality report included**: No upcharge for basic honesty. Cool.
* **Flexible pricing**: You can go budget or premium depending on your panic level.
* **It doesn’t pretend to be a university.** Just does the job, cleanly.

If we’re talking best college paper writing services, this one feels built by people who actually remember what finals week feels like.

# Any Red Flags?

Not many, honestly — but for transparency:

* Not as well-known as big names like SpeedyPaper or EssayMarker, so fewer external reviews (yet).
* Support is fast but text-based only — no phone option if you’re into that.  

Still, as far as [the best writing service](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) candidates go, I’ve had worse experiences with way flashier sites.

# Who’s It For?

* You’re buried under 3 assignments and 2 group projects.  
* You want solid, plagiarism-free work but don’t want to sell a kidney.  
* You appreciate speed, structure, and sanity.  

Whether you're a tired undergrad or a grad student just trying to survive, EssayEagle fits in with the more reliable options among the top essay writing services.

# Is [EssayEagle.net](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) the best essay writing service in existence? Maybe not.

But is it dependable, clean, and better than half the overpriced sites Reddit keeps dragging? 100%.

It’s definitely earned a spot on my “Would Use Again” list.

Im going on a semi spontaneous mountain solo trip and leaving on Monday, BUT all my gear that I ordered online seems to be stuck in transit and will most likely only arrive when I’m deep in the wild already, meaning I am missing some very important items I need with me. Perhaps someone could help me out and lend me some gear for one week? Sadly I’m on a tight budget (and timeframe) to double buy everything in shops now, so looking to borrow and will thank you with home baked cake upon my return. I can leave my ID or some money in deposit too of course.

It’s kinda urgent, so if someone can help a girl out, please let me know! 

What I need the most right now is-

- hammock with bug net OR a one person tent
- mat or camping inflatable thin mattress
- small stove or something to heat water up for coffee only
- solar power bank or charging mat

everything else I have more or less, but if you have something else that could be useful, I’ll take it! It’s my first time camping in wild for more than a night so not super experienced with equipment needed.

In the past few days, the app has become increasingly unresponsive, and as of yesterday is completely non-functional.  Now, when I open the app, it goes to the profiles screen and spins, never loading profiles and never adding the schedules button.

I have tried closing and re-opening the app and power cycling my Aiden (even though the app shows it as being online), but am not able to get profiles or schedules to load.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

I love the app's scheduling feature and use it to brew my morning coffee every day.  I rely on the app to edit schedules a lot (e.g. changing the start time while in bed when I wake up earlier than expected). So I sure hope this get fixed.

# Character One: Beginning of SP-01

Glorsku General:

Comrades and comrades!

I stand here before you as the commander of the Portal Star project, established right here in liberated Glorsku - in a country that only a few months ago was bleeding under the boot of Nazi oppression.

This place, where we now gather, was recently shaken by artillery fire during the Prague offensive. Well today - today we are here as free people. Not as victors over one regime, but as pioneers of a new era, an era of revolutionary science and socialist progress.

If the Nazi command had claimed authority over Lieutenant Białyslaw Pańtwosky, make no doubt about it - their Gestapo would have dragged Captains GG-02 and GG-03 into my command room. And in the worst case - it also executed them. But our men would face death without hesitation - because we are revolutionaries, not slaves!

Today we face a new threat. Not with a swastika, but with a dark force from beyond the stars.

Bram's weapon—that diabolical machine that creates portal passages between worlds—is a tool that can fall into the wrong hands. But know that an electromagnetic pulse, properly directed, can stop its entire course. Just as one single person can stand in the way of evil.

We have to learn from it. Comrades! We can resist. Not just alien invaders. Not just imperialist capitalism. But also despair, betrayal, indifference! And if we meet fascists, Americans, or capitalists in need - we will help them. Not because of them, but because of humanity itself. Because a true revolutionary knows that a person is more than an ideology.

Revolution does not spread by force, comrades. We don't need tanks to spread the truth. Our enemies - not excluding the Americans - may tempt the world, but they do not offer it a soul.

We are not fighting for conquest! We fear for the future! We are fighting for a revolution. For socialism. For the stars.

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!!





1951, a calm sky stretches overhead, with large clouds drifting swiftly across the sunlit day above a military base. And, Autumn forest turns from green to yellow like a lime color. Around its perimeter, protesters begin to gather. The bunker door starts to seal shut, guarded firmly by the entire army standing its ground. In the air—tense peace.

The protesters wave old Glorsku flags and chant slogans from before the Communist coup. Some shout for freedom. Others cry for bread.

Suddenly, the gate explodes. The crowd surges forward. Protesters breach the base.

“They're anti-communist.”

“Like fascist or capitalist?”

“No. The resistance movement is crucial for keeping our nation united—not to ignite a civil war between Czechs and Slovaks, nor to stage some revolutionary overthrow. We need to stop waging wars with other nations. We should be learning from the mistakes of the Interwar period.”

“They will come down under a united cause. And no—killing in its name will only end in bloodshed…”

“General, you need help—tanks, planes, something.”

“No. We don’t need a counterrevolution on our soil. Wait—who am I talking to? How old are you?”

“I am General Prahasko of the socialist underground. And now, Major General of the Homeland Army.

“I envy your title. Yet, I have a more important job than you.”

“What’s your post? Where do you operate?”

""Ask Boris, Head of the KGB. But understand this—if any civilian is killed on my bases, I’ll personally have him send *you* to Siberia. And if your men do such a thing under your command, I’ll kill you myself—by his own doctrine, as if I held the KGB chair. Protesters turned into rioters, echoing the Glorsku uprising—speaking again from the tense scenes of May 9th, 1954. But this isn’t May—it’s September 1st, 1955. This is for the government to resolve, not us. In May, it was the army’s task. September belongs to the politicians. But we are general, dummy.""

A few days in the future, “Tanya! We need you for the project. We’ll protect you—for the sake of your family’s future. I understand how much your family meant to you… how your mother’s birth was like the right hand of your core. You’re my aunt, Tanya. Not by blood alone, but by the oath of loyalty that binds us.”

“Erich Ivanov Serebryakov-Kozzacko... You are Rusyn, born of your mother’s homeland—the same homeland that gave me her loyalty with unwavering honor. If you carry her blood, then you carry the same flame I once thought had died with her.”

General Serebryakov-Kozzacko giving her favorite composer from relaxation being ready for her interview of her life in details, top secret information from her last life with non-favor light level of Rohypnol-Benzodiazepines plus high level of Ketamine beer for deep truth of her life. Then drinking drugged water with a light drink headed and slowed speech, generally showing the doctor to come here. “How long will its effects last?”

“It lasted around 11-26 hours for our interview and lasted 12-37 min, the beer effect would be stronger. She drank/ took this before?”

“Yes, I remember she experimented with my mother about drugs plus she was drinking at parties like hers and my mother’s birthday.”

12 minutes later, “I was a Japanese salaryman who was hit by a train by my canceling on man's future with a logical mindset.

I learned from this war within my timeline, but it was 10 years earlier than this timeline. I am not a girl for fixing this timeline because I know this from my own past life...”

She keeps talking about it. 11 hours later: “OK. I understand this about your past life, I want to know about this lifetime.”

“Doctor, 11 hours have gone by. She needs to take more?”

“No, she doesn't need to but she has 14 hours more to go away. I need to take Morphine from this to be successful. You can sleep in this interview and I will take it for medical reasons.”

Author’s words: This will be a summary of the interview for the future plots, this information will show about other volumes for you as a reader. Her words are similar to talking to the camera within a Live TV Show like hell’s kitchen.

""My new life in the Empire is one marked by conflict, and from the very beginning, I demonstrate a pragmatic, military-minded intelligence. My military career begins with my rapid rise through the ranks due to my remarkable talent for combat magic and tactical warfare. Despite being physically a child, my mind is that of a seasoned adult, focused on survival and strategic success. I am particularly known for my calculated, ruthless approach to war, gaining me the nickname The Devil of the Rhine.""

""I am not simply a war machine—I am also a victim of Being X’s divine intervention. My primary personal goal becomes escaping the hold of the divine entity that placed me into this world, as I believe that I am being punished for my previous life’s atheism. Being X frequently appears to me as an elusive, god-like force, constantly interfering with my fate, leading to my internal struggle between my atheism and the undeniable existence of a higher power that controls my life.""

""My military tactics are brilliant, but they are also deeply pragmatic and often morally ambiguous. As an officer, I am deeply ruthless in my actions, using my magic and strategic intellect to crush my enemies without hesitation. I am quick to exploit weaknesses in my adversaries and, often, my subordinates as well. My cold pragmatism allows me to survive in a brutal, war-torn world where alliances are temporary, and lives are expendable.""

""My subordinates, such as the members of my elite unit—especially my loyal subordinate, Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov—often find themselves caught between loyalty to me and the sheer terror of my cold, emotionless nature. My leadership style is often marked by my ability to outmaneuver my opponents tactically, exploiting weaknesses and leveraging the power of magic to ensure my dominance on the battlefield. My ascent through the military hierarchy is both a testament to my intelligence and my willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure my survival.""

""The central conflict of my life is my struggle against Being X, who not only controls my fate but also serves as the embodiment of divine providence. I, an atheistic character, loathe this entity and view it as the embodiment of everything I despise: an arbitrary higher power that imposes a predetermined fate upon me. In my previous life, I was a strong believer in self-determination and individual agency, rejecting any notion of divine intervention or guidance.""

""As I rise in military rank, Being X continues to intervene in my life in an attempt to guide me toward a religious awakening or to prove the existence of divine providence. This constant interference from Being X frustrates me, pushing me to confront a series of existential dilemmas. I become increasingly focused on finding a way to escape the divine’s influence, believing that my survival, success, and eventual escape from the god’s manipulation are the ultimate tests of my power and intelligence.""

""My antagonism toward Being X becomes a defining characteristic of my journey, and my attempts to find meaning in a world dominated by war, manipulation, and divine control are central to the storyline. This philosophical battle between my atheism and Being X’s divine machinations becomes one of the core themes of my existence.""

""My worldview is shaped by my experiences in the military. In this world, the Empire and its neighboring nations are embroiled in a brutal, unending war, with alliances shifting as quickly as military strategies. Magic is a powerful tool of warfare, and military leaders are expected to be both powerful mages and skilled tacticians. My leadership and magical abilities make me one of the Empire’s most feared officers, though I am also deeply aware of the human cost of warfare.""

""My pragmatic approach to the violence around me is rooted in the philosophy of survival and the will to power. I subscribe to a form of social Darwinism, believing that only the strong survive and that the weak must be discarded in the face of conflict. While I do not lack a sense of loyalty or responsibility to my comrades, my moral compass is twisted by the harsh realities of the world I inhabit, where survival often comes at the expense of others.""

""Despite my ruthless actions, there are moments where my humanity surfaces. I experience guilt, pain, and doubt, especially when confronted with the futility of the wars I fight or the personal losses I endure. These moments of vulnerability complicate my otherwise cold and calculating persona, highlighting the internal conflict that defines much of my character.""

""My ultimate goal is to escape the clutches of Being X and, in doing so, free myself from the divine interference in my life. Throughout my journey, I am consistently trying to outsmart the divine, using my intellect, military genius, and magic to out-maneuver Being X’s plans. This goal defines much of my character arc and drives my actions in both military engagements and personal decisions.""

""My relationship with my subordinates evolves as well. While I initially treat them as mere tools in my ascent through the ranks, I come to recognize their value and loyalty. My bond with them, particularly with Viktoriya and my other subordinates, is complex—I am both their leader and a person they look to for guidance, but at the same time, my methods often challenge their moral boundaries.""

""As my power grows, so too does the reach of Being X’s influence. The military conflicts I engage in become more complex and catastrophic, and my tactics are both admired and feared by all who witness them. However, as I approach the peak of my military career, my existential struggle with Being X comes to a head. I am faced with a final confrontation that will determine whether I can free myself from the divine's influence and prove that I can control my own fate.""

""The overarching plot of my life touches upon themes of free will versus divine fate, the morality of warfare, the corrupting nature of power, and the philosophical battle between belief and atheism. Throughout my journey, my character evolves from a purely pragmatic military leader to a person grappling with questions of identity, faith, and personal redemption.""

14 hours later: “Erich, what happened in this interview.”

“This interview was 26 hours long, while you had these questions, that you black out. While answering all questions is similar to driving blindness, aunt said that we need to sleep because we need water from too much alcohol that we had without knowing about it. The doctor told me to go on for our interview by pushing sub-conscious.”

Next day, “Aunt , drugging you for my knowledge of you. I know, my mother had this information for you, please don’t be pissed.”

“Erich, I don't do that much. I became friends with Being X, he told me in my dream. It is a secret from everything, I need to think about being X is actually my father from my past life. I can tell you and others about it, resetting them is the mother's secret to the whole family. I need to keep until I die like a full reset like a breaker, you know me more deeper then your mother for my sake.”

**Tanya von Degurechaf Courtroom From A Year Ago:**

A long, dark corridor lit by flickering sodium lamps. The air is damp with mildew and memory. Boots echo across concrete like distant gunfire. Tanya von Degurechaff enters, her posture soldier-straight, but her eyes… hollow. She wears a plain olive-gray coat, stripped of medals and insignia—like a ghost dressed in the shadow of her former self. Faces watch from both sides— soldiers, partisans, tribunal staff. Some in awe. Others in disgust. One old woman spits. At the front sits the panel: A Glorsku general, a Soviet commissar, a Jewish survivor in a modest shawl, and an American observer with a tape recorder. But the central voice is General Prahasko, the scar-faced veteran known for breaking war criminals with only questions.

“Tanya von Degurechaff. Former Commander, Imperial Mage Division. Known aliases: The Devil of the Rhine. Annihilation Angel. Secondhand Godchild. Accused of 21,500 confirmed civilian killings in the First War; indirect responsibility for around 80 million deportations and 4,356 extermination campaigns during the Second. Further accusations: psychological manipulation of child soldiers, deployment of unauthorized weapons upon surrendering forces, and—”

“Stop. Stop now!!! I can hear it any more being I am saying please, forgive me please.”

She picks up a charred photograph from the mountain of documents. A burned village. A dying child’s eyes stare straight at her—captured forever. With her tears like depressed person going do suicide.

“I... remember this one. That day... It was raining ash... I ordered it. I am like Hitler and Stalin in one person but I am the deadliest leader in the world. Fuck me, I was so evil more then worst one in my earth’s history.”

No denial. No apology. No attempt to shift blame. Just a broken soul standing naked before truth. Tanya pulls the files toward her—hands trembling, eyes hollow. And she begins to read aloud, each name, each location, each act. A ritual. A funeral. A courtroom exorcism. Tears stream silently. Each page a bullet into her own mythology.

“The Party has decided not to execute you. Instead—your name, your rank, your identity... will be erased. For the crimes of Tanya von Degurechaff, there will be no legacy. Only shame.”

She slowly removes her overcoat and places it on the cold stone floor. A final act of surrender.

“Then let her die here. With Suicidal mindset. Ashes of the Homeland for a new revolution is not just the overthrow of systems, but the honest facing of memory, guilt, and soul.”

She picks up the new registry document, signs it: Tanya walks alone through white ash and snow, her breath visible. Old barracks collapse in the wind behind her like memories crumbling. Children laugh in the distance, their voices bright but far. She stops. Watches. One tear rolls down her cheek—not for herself, but for the life she burned.

“Why, being X...? Why give me this life again? Perhaps… one soul can still be rebuilt.”

She looks to the pale winter sky. That stopped her depressive mindset and by wanting to start a new life of peace.

**Tanya’s Dream:**

In the heart of a fractured world, where memory and time collide in fractured symphonies, Tanya finds herself on an endless train, racing through endless landscapes of history’s ghosts—wars, revolutions, empires rising and falling in moments, scattered and lost. She sits there, staring out the window, seeing not the road ahead but the smoldering ruins of places she's never been, yet somehow knows deeply, intimately. The train doesn’t stop, but the scenery shifts, constantly changing from one chapter of her life to the next—flashes of victories long forgotten, failures she can't remember, and desires that were never her own. It all merges, a kaleidoscope of past and future worlds, and Tanya is a spectator, but also the director.

Her feet don’t feel the train beneath her—they feel the endless weight of the generations she carries on her shoulders. She tries to step off, but the floor beneath her dissolves, and she is transported into a courtroom, or perhaps a battlefield dressed as a courtroom. A figure sits at the front—her own face, twisted in judgment. She is both accused and accuser, and the crime is too vast to name. She opens her mouth to speak, to explain, to protest, but all that escapes her lips are screams—dissonant, tangled in a reel of static and memories too painful to untangle. The jury is made of faces she recognizes but can't place—those she has loved, and those she has betrayed. They do not speak. No one speaks. The verdict is not theirs to give. Time itself stands still, a frozen weight pressing on her chest.

She’s thrust from this space, as if pulled by invisible hands, and suddenly, she is in an office—an office she never worked in, yet somehow, it’s hers. Papers cover the desk, blank, unreadable, like the future before her. The walls, devoid of pictures, are shifting, constantly rearranging themselves. The air hums with the sound of decisions she hasn’t made, lives she hasn’t lived, promises broken before they could be kept. In the corner of the room stands Viktoriya, a quiet figure, still, hands holding a cup of coffee that never cools. She stares at Tanya with eyes that hold both sympathy and reproach, asking softly, almost as if she already knows the answer: “Will you start over?”

Tanya opens her mouth, but before she can respond, the world itself bends around her. The walls crack, splintering into fragments that rain down like snowflakes, falling into an abyss of water. She doesn’t drown, but she sinks—deeper, deeper, into a cold, silent ocean of her own making. Down below, she sees something. A figure, small, fragile, yet unbroken, stands on the ocean floor. It is herself, only younger—barefoot, untarnished by the wars she fought, unscarred by the lessons she learned too late. This younger version of Tanya looks at her with soft eyes, not full of judgment or pity, but a quiet, painful understanding. The child speaks in a voice that isn’t really a voice, but a pull at her heart: “Remember... and choose.”

And then everything stops. The water stills, the office vanishes, the train ceases its endless motion. Tanya wakes—but she is not where she was. She is not who she was. She is something *new*, something *other*, yet still herself in ways she cannot yet understand. The train, the endless ride, is still there, but now, it no longer holds her captive. She is not rushing to somewhere she must be, nor is she chasing something that no longer matters. She sits, still, and looks out at the passing world with eyes that have finally seen it for what it truly is—fragile, broken, yet beautiful. And for the first time in ages, she doesn't feel the weight of history bearing down on her, nor the responsibility of wars not her own. She feels free.

In this final moment of clarity, she understands that the dream is not hers to conclude. It holds no end, no final destination. It is simply a journey—an endless series of steps she must choose to take, day by day, moment by moment, unburdened by a past that doesn’t belong to her, or a future she cannot control. In the space between what is and what could be, she chooses—not to flee, but to live, to forgive, to remember. To start anew. Even as empires fall and new banners rise, even as Tanya von Degurechaff becomes Tanya Gurečafska, no new name can erase the past. No revolution can erase the memories of the soul. I know I am broken inside, but I will heal from this.

**Her Bedroom:**

Tanya awakens, drenched in cold sweat, her hands trembling as the remnants of her dream linger in the stillness of the room. The nightmare, a shattered mosaic of past and future, leaves her shaken, as though she's been dragged across time itself by forces she cannot name or escape. The weight of her past decisions presses heavily on her chest, suffocating, relentless. She stands there, facing the mirror in her quiet bedroom, staring at her reflection. The woman in the glass is no longer just Tanya von Degurechaff; she is a soul fractured by endless wars, hollow victories, and a future that stretches out, as boundless and empty as the train she was trapped on in her dream.

In this moment of painful clarity, she feels something unfamiliar stir within her—a voice, perhaps her own, perhaps something more, urging her to remember. To choose. To start anew. The young girl she saw beneath the ocean’s depths, untouched by the world’s burdens, gazes at her with quiet understanding. ""Remember... and choose."" A pull at her heart, as though this decision is the key to breaking free from the never-ending cycle of destruction.

Tanya’s gaze shifts from the mirror, where her reflection begins to morph into the figure of her past life as a Japanese salaryman—silent, composed, holding a cup of coffee. Her presence is both soothing and accusatory. ""Will you start over?"" The question lingers in the air, an undeniable challenge. For a brief moment, Tanya freezes, not from fear, but from the weight of what such a choice means. The walls around her crack, shattering like the illusions she has carefully constructed. She sinks—not into despair, but into something deeper, something unspoken, a quiet catharsis.

Tears fall—unexpected, soft, but necessary. For the first time, she does not flee. She does not run from the past, nor from the future. She simply chooses—to live, to forgive, to remember. Not to escape, but to begin again, as if every moment, every decision, is hers to shape. And in that fragile, fleeting moment of clarity, Tanya feels free—free from the past, free from the train, free from the wars that once defined her existence. She is still herself, but a new version. The journey is far from over, and perhaps it never will be, but now, she is no longer a prisoner. She is the one who will choose the next step, even in the face of all that still needs healing.

*Erich didn’t approach me seeking mercy; he approached out of necessity. The world they lived in—fragile, shattered—was on the edge of another catastrophe. New powers were rising from the wreckage of old wars, much like my own world in the 20th century. They needed my tactical brilliance, her understanding of war on a scale no other soul could comprehend.*

""I believed in logic alone. In this life, I believed only in survival. In the next… perhaps I will learn to believe in souls. The higher I rise, the deeper the scars I leave, both on the world and on myself.""

*I eventually come to realize that no victory, no accumulation of power, no clever evasion of Being X’s plans can erase the weight of what I’ve done. The blood of the Rhine, the ashes of the villages, the broken gazes of children—they never wash away, no matter how far I run, or how high I climb.*

""This is so annoying about buying DVDs, always the cash grab! I hate how they do this every time a series ends!"" he says. He turns to his mom and says, ""Mom, you’re crying because I’m crying."" *My mom is the most sensitive in the family, unlike my dad, who’s the complete opposite—he came from a military family, just like my grandpa, who fought in the Pacific during WWII.*

""No, I’m not crying. I’m just cutting onions for dinner. Son, you’re too impulsive for your own name,"" she replies.

Hey, I am the narrator here. For non-Japanese speakers, \[まんさらり\]\[服サラリーマンの\] reads as *Mansarari Fukusaraimanu*. His name roughly means ""Mansarari’s Clothes for Businessmen."" I’m so happy about this flashback—it brings back the nostalgia of my childhood in NYC. I’m sharing this from my memory, back when DVDs and TV were annoyingly always pushing you to buy DVDs or CDs. But looking back, it was simple—nothing like today’s chaos with social media.

|**Father’s Suicide Letter:** **Dear My Lovely Wife:** If you are reading this, it means I could no longer carry the weight. I’m sorry—I’m so deeply sorry for the pain this may cause you, though I fear my absence will only echo the emptiness that has already begun to take root. Our son is gone. I can’t believe I’m writing those words. I can’t breathe knowing they are true. The light of my life, the boy I held in my arms, taught to walk, taught to speak, and dreamed with—he's gone. And no reason, no explanation, no justice can ever make that right. I tried to be strong for you. For him. But the silence left in his absence is louder than any scream. And when the truth arrived—too late, too sharp—it broke something in me that cannot be repaired. He died, and the world kept turning like nothing had happened. That’s the part I can't live with. What kind of father am I if I can’t protect my son? What kind of man survives while his child is buried beneath questions and grief? Please forgive me. This is not your fault. It’s not even mine alone. It is the fault of a world that waited too long, and a justice system that counts days while we count pieces of our hearts. I cannot endure this timeline any longer. I am coming for him like helping in my next life. Forever yours, Your Beloved Husband|

**Chapter Two: Journey Begins**

We come back to this reality, a term called SP-01 coming out from some desert that they thought of as Sahara. “Wow, it is successful. Later I thought, GG-01 and GG-02 need to ride on Pionir with me opposite the way of sunset because you know from geology. You need to learn Francois because you know our enemy language (from our occupation by Nazis) for your own good, GG-03 and GG-04 staying next to the portal for sending messages to we made it plus protecting the gateway. Let’s go, we need to come back to our base for making plans then giving it to our government not only saving our comrades.”

A few days later, “where is the other side of the port city called Nouadhibou and New Nouad- hibou is a town that gives a faster path for us by ferry, not ships like in that city.”

“Hey, you sound like autistic. You've been in here before?” Everyone is laughing while the truck is shaking like an earthquake.

“Of course, it was my visit to Henri Joseph Goumenri. He is like us for socialism and anti-imperial, I love his work like Erich will talk about because I want to know you more than you know me like you are doing now. Well we still need to go to New Nouadhibou, you need to go for other topics. Sorry, for that our discussion from my past. Similar question about Greece, like you talked about a girl that you have a crush on?”

“No, no. She isn’t like that for me,” why’ll blush at the same time.

“You know you are cute, when you are blushing. Look at Horizon, New Nouadhibou is close. We will be around an hour, that good that we are not living in the Firefly universe. New Nouadhibou is his hometown, he has few kids that you like spending time with. Someone is attacking the town and city, Nazi pirates. No, it is not them. Resistance freighter, you need to be ready to fight like in Stalingrad. We can fly well because I was banned from flying, they have it. Fuck, I’ll be using it from them. Now, go faster.”

They are shocked about Resistance frights coming from flying overhead on a beetle, “they don’t have armor like they have stolen the tech. We need to fight with French forces for our safety, you need to say to them that we are Glorsku army in exile.”

“Pirate Raid Sirens combined all of Hörmann and Siemens sirens into ones called Sirènes d'occupation system and Siemens one is louder for telling what it is air for example, he is training your skills against resistance like under our nation will have.” They are riding to the town with a non-propaganda song to hide their identity, “Goumenri don’t know about our identity. He will understand about it, better to change the topic about how we are opposites for our own good.”

An hour later, the town is in ruin from the pirate's defensive raid system screaming out like a crying baby from top of the lungs while going into the city. People doing their things then people are punching, they are running into shelters like cattle herds going into processing facilities from the deadliest shot called bunker busters bullet. “Turyści odchodzą od ogona i budynku, do magazynu, a ty możesz popatrzeć na prasę.” - Their misunderstanding from a Pospolita tour guide into their language. “Turisté jdou na chvostu budovám, ke skladování a mohou být staré u tisku.”- what the tour guide actually said.

Children are playing around with their bikes and scooters within bomb craters, “going to the shelter and meeting up with their parents… What up, my old friend and come to bomb shelter with me. I like to talk about our life going on, I heard an Empire dictator looks similar to you.”

“Hey, Tanya! How are you, my old friend.”

“This is Goumenri?” 

“Yes, he is. He will help with our issues, if you ask anything that he will do.”

“I will fight for your city because we are the Free Glorsku Corps of the International Occup- ational Army. I know you need time with Tanya for old pals to do.” 

“Do you know that the Cold War is between National Liberal and Social Liberal from outcry from National Socialism (White Army and Weimarium), I predict the West will be an unholy social liberal like in 1930s-40s.”

“Did you hear about Nazical Watch Trials from members of the Imperiale Weibliche Völkisch Prinzip Ordnungs Partei (Imperial People of Girlhood Order Principle Party)? That truth about your prediction with my own will be like your mindset, the pact of nations will be going opposite paths like we are seeing now in our modern world that people are aware of it. I will teach you about the power of wisdom from scientific magic, I was the master of your general and Tanya came to me to relearn wisdom from god but she didn’t learn from him.”

“O Arabisch Kossacki w pospolity noci a nich, poza Łado senu: O arabských Kozákoch v pospolity noci a ich útoku, póza Lado nespal. Dwaji Dwaji, Ludzisk Pospolitacy od Rzeczpospolita: Dvaji dvaji, obyčejní lidé z Rzeczpospolita.”

They all going into shelter but they don’t know those tourist are spies of Peoples Rzeczpospolita, Rzeczpospolian can speaking Rusynian language put within Sokolia/ Góralska/ Rzeczpos- polita for international language is dialectics per language (this is like paradox from coming from dying language, they don’t know it is there god is dead but other god took over dying world like “The Boy and The Horn” can be called beauty of death by giving alway to other generation).

Top Secret discussion for you, you need to give me — a card for the classified document but you are spying on them under gods eye. If you are an angel that you can go for free, if not you can’t know our secret from Top Earth’s Secret (from your freedom to create dialog).

Kids are playing an artifact that looks like Pokémon ball, “Hey Kids. What type of toy do you have?” The kids that Tanya is talking to, he is confused and afraid that you were a kid that you felt defensive to your toy that you think some will take away from you. “It looks like an artifact not a toy, it looks like a pokémon ball. Where did you find that? I don’t mind you keeping it because finder keepers, I need to take over that pokémon ball factory.”

“What is a Pokémon ball? Pokémon ball, a toy or something else like a grenade?""

“Hey Kid, throw it in the corner with your mother standing next to you to protect you from us.” Then that kid throws the pokémon ball, there is a type of Pokémon.

“Wait. what? That is a Gadmeer or Mewtwo! Mewtwo (from Pokémon) made Gadmeer (Stargate) into their civilizational empire/-s, Mewtwo escaped into Stargate’s Universe by Quantum Window becoming Gadmeer from finding a time machine in their views?”

“Hello, my race is Gadmeer Beta Alius from the pokémon genus called Mewtwo.”

“Ok, you proved my theory about Pokémon's Universe Quantum Windowed Stargate.”

“I want to be your Pokémon because you know my kind and stargate so why’ll.”

“In this reality that we have music and gate guns, Stargate is called Starportal in this reality. I will call you from Taban-bę (Nepanese language of datebase), do you love that? Pokémon can’t exist in this world, what is your main culture?” Nepan is Japan in this reality not Nepal, XP.

“I don’t mind, it may fit you more than my own title. My race is that we are using a Pokémon ball coming from Mewtwo world as an original world like Pokémon ball factories in abandoned islands, it was nuked around a few nuclear bombs per island.” The Pokémon world looks like a type of utopia that comes from the eyes of a kid but the reality is darker or even darker then our timeline/ world like his pre-isekaizian Earth history, “I want to say something and ask a ques- tion. What is your name? How is the quantum window different from the quantum mirror?”

“My name is only cats and pokémon understands, humans need to name us like pets and that is shameful. I want to see your most popular cities and landmarks on Earth, like you have in Roo- sevelt Island Civic Center, New York, New Yorkshire, New England?”

“Yes, we expect that it isn't called New York, New Yorkshire but Yankeeham, Yankeeshire in Angloland and we have Roosevelt-Randall-Ricker-Governor Island Civic Center for the SEM-P system like other nations have there to better control over the nation with Dingecommunism/ Resgemeinsamism from Rzeczpospolitism within Rzeszpospolitism. Kościuszko become frist president of Angloland and he pushed Resgemeinsamism is nationalist with his moment are socialist scheme that they pushing for Dingecommunism, Angloland Civil War had two main problem is Slavery from greedic elites from the Southern part of Angloland but North don’t want it anymore plus Angloland Eastern-Western divided was made people wanting to for Empire are Resgemeinsamism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into being like Roman Empire from the word called Rzeszpospolitism) against it could called Dingecommunism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into become like family from the word called Rzeczpospolitism).""",1,1752838364.0,writers,1,1.0,False

How the gear will be used - Home use and city commuting. I'd like to be able to block chatter and construction noise without needing to turn up the volumen too much. The worst noise I need to be able to block or at least dampen is my upper neighbour's stomping when he practices accordion (plus points if I can stop hearing the accordion too, listening to fhe same 3/4 notes in loop for hours is...

1m2zsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepEssentialsIndia/comments/1m2zsky/practical_guide_to_better_sleep/,Practical Guide to Better Sleep,"Sleep isn’t just “rest.” It’s when your body and mind recharge, fix, and reset. Yet many of us struggle with poor sleep because of habits, stress, screens, and noise.

Sleep hygiene is a set of daily habits and choices that make sleep deeper and more regular. Good sleep hygiene can cut down tired mornings, boost focus, improve mood, and lower health risks like heart disease and diabetes.

Here’s a **practical guide** to what works and why.

## What is Sleep Hygiene?

Simple daily actions and environment tweaks to:

*   Fall asleep faster
    
*   Sleep deeper
    
*   Wake up fresher
    

Poor sleep hygiene = late nights, screens in bed, coffee late in the day, noisy bedrooms, irregular schedules.


## Key Parts of Sleep Hygiene

| Habit | Why It Helps | How To Do It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regular schedule | Keeps body clock steady | Same sleep & wake time daily, even weekends |
| Dark room | Darkness triggers melatonin | Blackout curtains, eye mask, no screens |
| Quiet | Noise breaks sleep cycles | Earplugs, white noise, heavy curtains |
| Cool temp | Body needs to cool to sleep | 16–19°C, breathable sheets |
| Limit caffeine/alcohol | Both delay and fragment sleep | Avoid coffee after 2 pm, no alcohol 3–4 hrs before bed |
| Move daily | Exercise helps deeper sleep | Walk, cycle, or stretch, not right before bed |
| Pre-sleep wind down | Lowers stress & signals sleep time | Read, stretch, journal, dim lights |


## Light & Sleep

*   Morning sunlight (15–30 min) helps reset your body clock.
    
*   Avoid screens 1–2 hours before bed. If needed, use blue light filters.
    
*   Use warm, dim lighting in evenings.
    

- - -

## Noise & Sleep

*   Traffic, TVs, or people talking can wake you.
    
*   White or pink noise machines can mask sudden sounds.
    
*   Rugs, curtains, or acoustic panels help too.
    

## Temperature & Comfort

*   Best sleep temp is about 16–19°C.
    
*   Light cotton or linen bedding helps.
    
*   Avoid heavy meals or hot showers before bed.
    

- - -

## Evening Routine

*   Stop doom-scrolling and emails before bed.
    
*   Try reading, gentle yoga, or deep breathing.
    
*   Keep it consistent so your body expects sleep.
    

## Substances & Sleep

*   Caffeine: stays in your body for hours. Avoid after 2 pm.
    
*   Alcohol: may make you sleepy at first but fragments deep sleep.
    
*   Nicotine and some meds also disrupt sleep—ask a doctor if unsure.
    

## Extra Tips

*   Short nap? Keep it under 20–30 min.
    
*   Track your sleep to see what affects it—but don’t obsess over numbers.
    
*   If you can’t sleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something calming.
    
*   Try to eat dinner at least 2–3 hours before bed.

## Why It Matters

Good sleep hygiene can:

*   Sharpen focus and memory
    
*   Improve mood
    
*   Lower risk of diabetes and heart disease
    
*   Boost energy for daily life
    
## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Can’t fall asleep | Get out of bed, do a calm activity, go back only when sleepy |
| Wake up often | Check for noise, light, heat or medical reasons |
| Daytime tiredness | Check sleep hours, cut caffeine, regular schedule |
| Irregular sleep | Adjust bedtime slowly, avoid long naps |",1,1752838051.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False

We were dating for a year at that point and so even though I was uncomfortable with it, the relationship was too young to make demands about it. 

It has caused some strain, especially since she’s had a reputation for being a cheater. She once left lingerie calendars of herself in the kitchen. I had to stay at the house for a few days when my lease was up, and she invited his ex over for coffee (they’re friends, but also why would you do it while I’m at the house..) She doesn’t mean badly and there is no sexual tension between them I’m sure - she is just clueless and rude. 

I always feel awkward visiting the house, and it’s been two years now. I asked my boyfriend to come away with me this year and travel/work. He refused, as is doing a masters. 

Now he’s staying in the same town in the same house for a third year. So now if I want to visit him.. I can’t. I don’t want to stay in that house with her (especially considering the last time I did I had to walk into his ex at the table). It’s also too expensive to get a hotel often. 

I asked him if he’s thinking about moving out. He said it’s too much hassle. He likes where he lives. Any advice? Should I just get over myself? ",2,1752837930.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I (29F) and my friend Maria (fake name) (30F) have known each other since we were kids. We met at school when we were 7 and became especially close during our teenage years. We were always kind of “different” from the rest of our friend group — more open-minded, more internationally minded, more… us. 

I was the only one in our group of 5–6 girls who openly said I had no interest in getting married. I’ve always wanted a life partner, not a husband, and the whole idea of marriage always felt unnecessary to me. Same goes for having kids. I basically raised myself, my mother, and most of my friends. Since I was young, I carried the emotional load for myself and others, and without even realizing it until recently, this is probably that led to me developing a deep resistance to motherhood. It just didn’t feel right for me. This will make sense later on.

That said, I’ve always been the first to say “I’ll be the cool aunt, the one dancing at your wedding and babysitting your kids.” I had mentally prepared for a lifetime of being the child-free one in the group, and honestly, I’m completely fine with that.

Now to the actual story.

One day, Maria told me that she and her partner had started trying for a baby. She was very honest and said she wasn’t quite ready yet, but since it can take time to get pregnant, they were starting now, just casually. I was really happy for her. I even started joking about being “auntie” to her hypothetical child. I wished them all the best.

Three months later, she called me at night and told me she took a test and it was positive. Now, keep in mind, during those three months she had told me *many* times that she still didn’t feel ready. So when she called, I didn’t know how to react. I asked her how she felt; was she excited? Anxious? Scared? Happy? I just wanted to meet her where *she* was emotionally.

She said she was happy, but wasn’t 100% sure about the result. It was a late-night test, and she wanted to confirm it in the morning. She mentioned that she had taken a test the month before too, and it came back negative, which really upset her. So this time, she didn’t want to get her hopes up.

I told her that made sense and it would be better to check again the next morning. She agreed, and said she was also worried because she’d had some wine the night before and hadn’t even missed her period yet. So yeah, I said, let’s not jump to conclusions until test #2. I felt kind of bad for not jumping up and down and being sceptical when she told me, but I was honestly very confused with all the info I had.

Spoiler: Test #2 was positive.

She told her partner, and I was thrilled for them both. I was ready to spoil the baby rotten.

That’s when her anxiety started. The “Am I ready?”, “Is everything okay?”, “What if something goes wrong?” phase. Her first trimester was rough. She had intense nausea and couldn’t keep anything down. I visited her often and even once put together a little care package with baby food (the only thing she could stomach), some of her fav snacks just in case, and little comfort items like scrunchies and fluffy socks to lift her mood. I always called her after her doctor appointments to check in, and I did my best to calm her worries when she spiraled, which was often.

But I also started noticing some things that felt... over the top.

For example: we were walking down the street once, and a guy *in the distance* started running to catch a train. He wasn’t coming toward us, not even close. But Maria immediately grabbed her belly and turned away like someone was charging at her. I asked what was wrong, and she said she got scared because he was running.

I told her she needed to relax — people don’t just sprint elbow-first into strangers. And also, if just *bumping into someone* (not that this guy was even close to us!) could threaten a pregnancy, humanity would’ve gone extinct long ago. I tred to say that she has to enjoy her pregnancy like she always wanted and don’t worry for all the things that could go wrong, but of course it did nothing for her.

There were a lot of moments like this. But I kept telling myself, “She’s pregnant. Hormones. Anxiety. It’s understandable.”

One time she was carrying a small grocery bag (which she had picked up and held herself, by the way) and then looked at me like “Take this, I’m not supposed to lift heavy things.” I took it ofc, but I was a bit annoyed, since her attitude was starting to be unreasonably demanding. Another time, I had bad period cramps and was instinctively holding my lower stomach, and she looked at me all snarky and said, “Why are *you* holding your stomach now?”, as if holding your stomach is a privilege that only pregnant women have. I just told her, “I’m in pain. It’s a normal reflex. A lot of women do that during their period and I certainly always have done it.”

Another moment: when she told her mom she was pregnant, she did it by showing her a cute video titled “What it means to be a grandma.” Her mom didn’t get it and Maria was visibly annoyed. I reminded her that her mom already has *four* grandkids. This wasn't *news* in the same way. That kind of announcement video works best when it’s someone’s *first* grandchild — not their fifth. I gave her the example of her becoming a mother now, so when she has her next one, she will already be a mother. She got mad at me for saying that. I guess I wasn’t being “supportive” enough?

Anyway, I even threw her a small gender reveal — just her, her partner, me and my partner. Everything seemed fine on the surface… but the more time passed, the more I felt like I couldn’t be myself around her. I was walking on eggshells. And the last thing I wanted was to upset her or make her feel unsupported, so I just… let her take the lead. Let her choose the conversations. Let her guide what we did.

Maria had told me she wanted me to be a big part of this new chapter in her life and I felt the same way. I told her I was genuinely excited and that *literally anything* she needed, no matter how silly or small, she should just tell me. I was ready to vacuum her apartment, iron her clothes (and I HATE ironing), or hold the baby while she took a nap. I wanted to learn everything: what newborns need, and what new mothers need even more.

For me, it was never about the baby. I knew the baby would have all the attention from family, friends, and his father. I wanted to make sure *she* was okay and I made this very clear to her.

Side note: I’m not really a “kid person.” It’s not that I don’t get along with them, I just prefer not to have kids in my life. But I’d made it clear: when a kid is “ours”, meaning part of our world, loving them is non-negotiable.

After she gave birth, every time we visited (my partner always came too — the four of us were still technically a crew), I always checked in on *her* first. How was she feeling? Was she okay? When she cried and said everything felt overwhelming, I reassured her: it’s normal. Her body was flooded with hormones, she wasn’t sleeping, and everything was unfamiliar. She was doing great and nothing was “wrong” with her.

On the phone, when she mentioned chores piling up, I’d offer to come over and help, maybe get some cleaning done and catch up a bit. She always said no. If I had extra food or made something I knew she liked, I’d call and ask if she wanted some for her and her partner.  
Again — no thanks.

She often complained to me about all the people coming over to visit the baby. She said she was tired of always having guests and just wanted quiet time with her partner and their child as a family. Totally valid. But after hearing that enough times, and getting turned down repeatedly, I started stepping back. I stopped offering help so often but not out of resentment, but because I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable or feel like I was pushing myself into their space.

Then came the moment that really stung. I had asked her to teach me how to change diapers since I wanted to be helpful and confident if I ever needed to step in. She showed me once. The next time we visited, her partner was changing the baby’s diaper. I stood nearby, holding the baby’s socks, and reached over to gently help just by putting the socks on. He *snatched* them from my hands and did it himself.

It hurt. A lot. Like I wasn't allowed to touch the baby, cause I would hurt it somehow. But I once again gave them grace. They were new parents. They were setting boundaries. Maybe they still needed space. I let it go.

Then came the baby’s first birthday. Maria scheduled it *on the exact same day* I had a final exam for my Master’s, something she had known for *months*. The exam was in another city, a 2.5-hour flight away. Skipping wasn’t an option. Failing it would mean risking another round of tuition, which was a four-digit amount. So my partner went alone, with the baby’s gift and a small box I’d prepared just for Maria and her partner. The box had fun adult items: alcohol, coffee, the devil’s lettuce, lube, funny coasters that said “Best Mom/Dad Ever,” and a handwritten card that said: “Today we celebrate your son, but also *you two* — one full year of parenting. You’re doing amazing. Take care of yourselves. Stay close to each other.  
Your happiness is the foundation of your family’s happiness.”

Their response?

“Awwww thanks so much”  
And that was it. No comment. No follow-up. Nothing.

Around that time, they also started planning their wedding.

In our culture, it’s common to have a joint wedding and baptism when the baby’s still young.  
We had previously talked about me being Maria’s maid of honor. Now, she asked me to be the godmother too. I was over the moon and I promised her that I’d do everything in my power to be the *best* one I could.

She was understandably stressed. New mom, planning a wedding, the last thing I watned is to add pressure. So I waited for her to guide the process. I didn’t want to say or do anything that would trigger more stress.

Then, during a visit, she asked to talk privately. She said: “If being the godmother feels like too much for you, it’s okay. I’d rather you didn’t do it if it’s going to stress you.”

Looking back, that was a flashing red flag. But at the time? I didn’t get it.

I told her I didn’t understand why she’d say that. I said multiple times that I *wanted* to be her child‘s godmother. But I gave her the option; if she had someone else in mind, I wouldn’t be offended. I reassured her it wouldn’t change anything between us. She should pick whoever made her feel most comfortable.

Fast forward: my partner and I ended up paying around **€5,000** total — between godparent and wedding costs, flights (destination wedding), bachelor/bachelorette stuff, outfits, accommodations, everything. And through it all? We weren’t involved in *anything*. We were just paying.

I didn’t expect to choose the flowers or the cake, but I *had* believed her when she said we’d be part of the experience. In the end, the only thing we did was pay and cash a favor with a friend of mine that did their table decorations for free.

Still, I justified everything. “She’s just stressed.” “Everything will go back to normal after the wedding.”

But it didn’t and it has already been 2 years since all this started this far.

I cried during the ceremony, not out of sadness, but because I was truly happy for her.  
She got the day she wanted, with the man she loved. She got the life she always dreamed of. And she chose to share it with me. That meant something.

Or so I thought.

The few days after the wedding? Nothing. We exchanged a couple of logistical texts.  
That was it. We had *one* day planned (months in advance) to finally relax together as friends and see the baby again. They canceled last minute. They went out for lunch with Maria’s brother, whom they saw *constantly* anyway. Meanwhile, *we* hadn’t seen them, or the baby, in 2.5 months. Maria had left early for the wedding city to prep things, so this was supposed to be the first post-wedding hangout.

She was cold. Not like a friend who’s busy. Like a person who no longer wants you around.  
  
Next time we talked was when they called us for wish happy birthday to my partner in october (the wedding was august) and we arranged a coffee date to see them and especially our godson. That’s when we told them that we decided to get married. (More about this later on.) We meet a few times after, but I was always the one initiating contact.

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. I asked Maria to meet up,  just the two of us. I told her straight up: “Let’s be honest, if I don’t start this conversation, you won’t.” She agreed.

What followed was an *eight-hour* conversation. There were tears. It was intense. I obviously can’t write out the whole thing here, but here are the key moments that stuck with me:

\- I told her that my partner and I felt like walking wallets, since we were just expected to pay for her wedding and baptism without really being part of anything. We didn’t get to experience the process, and it didn’t feel joyful to us. Her response?

“It was *our* wedding. We did what we wanted. It wasn’t your place to have any say. I wouldn’t have done anything differently.” This is  valid, but this is not what I meant. Being part of my friends wedding shouldn’t feel like I am taken advantage of, at least I don’t think so.

\- She said she had expected “more” from me. When I asked what she meant, she said I’d promised to help with cooking, cleaning, babysitting etc. I reminded her that I *did* offer those things, repeatedly. I even told her I could show her all the texts and calls where I tried to help and she declined. Her answer?

“That’s just how new moms are. We don’t ask for help. You should’ve just come anyway.” I told her that was *completely* contradictory to what she’d said over and over: “We need time, just the three of us.” That was a clear boundary and I respected it. I wasn’t going to push my way into their home or overstep, especially during such a vulnerable time. She didn’t respond.

\- She said our friendship ended, for her, the moment I didn’t call her to say I got engaged. This indeed happened, but what is important to know is that me and my partner do not care about these things. The only reason we decided to get married is for leagal reasons and what she calls an ‚engagement‘ was us deciding to go to the court house and sign the papers. My partner also got me a ring as a gift, but tbh, he often buys me jewelry anyway, I have multiple rings from him. I told her that after 20+ years of friendship, she should know that engagements and weddings aren’t a big deal to me. Certainly not enough to call people and make announcements, social media posts etc. PLUS, we hadn’t spoken in months. The last time we did, she canceled on me for a better plan and treated my partner and me like we were strangers.

  
She insisted that *my* engagement was emotionally significant *for her*, and that she cried all day when she found out I hadn’t told her. I was stunned. I repeated: “But it wasn’t significant for *me*.” Why should I base my communication around *her* feelings about *my* life, especially when things were already so cold between us? No clear answer. Just more crying. More self-victimization.

\- At one point, she said: “I guess it’s my fault for having expectations of people who don’t live up to them.” And I wanted to laugh. Like all of us, she has strengths and flaws. One of her flaws (and I say this with love) is that she’s incredibly self-centered. I’ve always known that. I accepted it. That’s what love is, right? Accepting someone with their flaws. She’s *far* from a people-pleaser, but she framed herself like she was one. To *me.* Me, who was such a hardcore people-pleaser for most of my life that I didn’t even *have* a life of my own. I didn’t say anything. Her experience is valid, and maybe she sees herself that way. But it felt so disconnected from reality I didn’t know what to say.

\- She told me she doesn’t think I love her child, and that the whole “godmother thing” felt too much for me. That’s when I got angry. Now she knows better how I feel? I gave her so many examples of how much I care about him. I reminded her that *the only reason* we’re still talking at all is *because* of him. I told her, bluntly, that if it weren’t for her son, I would’ve cut off contact completely. She agreed. I still don’t understand how both those things can be true. 

\- The only real “wrongdoing” she brought up from my side was that once, during her pregnancy, I told her about a true crime documentary I’d watched where one of the victims happened to be pregnant.  
I love true crime, and for years I’d shared with her wild stories I saw or read about. In this case, the woman and her baby *survived* and lived a totally healthy life afterward.  
I honestly don’t see how that was disturbing, especially when later, *she* gossiped about another pregnant woman who had lost her baby. If anything, *that* should’ve been more upsetting to her, right? Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t know.

\- At the end of the conversation, she asked, “So… what now?” I told her I needed time. I didn’t know how long, and I couldn’t promise anything about our future. The only thing I *could* promise was that I wouldn’t disappear from her son’s life. Even if our friendship ended, my partner and I would still be there for him.

But even after that marathon of a talk, and her telling me that she missed me and other nice things, it was still *just me* reaching out for the next several months. We were still the ones initiating everything; trying to see the kid, proposing to hang out (even just the adults, like old times).

  
Until one day, recently, the realization really hit me: I’m the only one texting. I’m the only one making plans. I’m the only one who seems to care about keeping this ‚friendship‘ going.

Maria lives like her family is the *only* thing that matters, not just to her, but to everyone in the world. She behaves like I should be grateful to her for even allowing me to exist near her and her family and puts down any accomplishment or problem I have. And look, if she truly believes that nothing in life is meaningful outside of her partner and her son, that’s her right. She can live her life however she wants. But the passive-aggressive posts on social media — the ones that say life has no meaning without children — are hard to not feel targeting.

  
The comments she’s made about me are hurtful to say the least.Things like, I’ll never be a good mom because I don’t *want* to be one (As if every woman who *wants* to be a mother automatically becomes a great one. Sure.). Or that I am being dramatic when I say I am tired when I work fulltime and study for my Master fulltime, while working a second job once a week, cause ‚other people have done it and they survived‘. When we moved we found an amazing apartment that got complimented from everyone we know and they had only negative things to say about it (mostly things that weren’t even true). When we got married the lady that gathered all our documents and such asked us many questions about our history as a couple and she ended up writing an amaying personalized speech for us that she read the day of. When I asked my friend, who attented ofc, what she thought about the speech and how thoughtful it was, she just made the sound ‚ehh‘.

Her attitude makes me feel like I must’ve done something *terribly* wrong. That I hurt her in some deep way I can’t see. That all the bitterness she directs toward me must have *some* basis  and I just don’t know what it is.

But I truly don’t know what I did wrong. The only thing I *can* pinpoint is that I was more patient with her than she probably deserved. I tolerated things I shouldn’t have. I let too many things slide. And maybe I gave her the space to treat me this way, but she just took full advantage of it. I can’t really blame her for that. People take what they’re given.

But still… Is there something I’m missing?

If anyone has any perspective, I’d truly appreciate it. I have no problem owning my mistakes. I just want to understand *where*, if anywhere, I went wrong.",7,1752837783.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

1m2zpbw,https://i.redd.it/xw822x2jamdf1.jpeg,Grinder reassembling - toward “Coarse” makes grind finer? [La Pavoni Domus Bar],"Hi everyone,

As a new project I recently bought a used Pavoni Domus Bar. I disassembled and cleaned, including the built-in grinder (should be identical to the grinder in the Anita PL042 and the standalone grinder PL043). When I wanted to reassembling everything, I noticed something strange:

For the factory reset of the grinder, the upper burr needs to be screw down clockwise.

Now:
When I turn the outer grind adjustment knob toward “Coarse”, the upper burr rotates clockwise, which actually brings it closer to the lower burr.
As a result, the grind becomes finer, not coarser as expected.

This seems to completely reverse the expected behavior — turning toward “Coarse” should increase the distance between the burrs and make the grind coarser, not finer.

What also irritates me: the manual states that 
> Choose higher degrees to get coarse-ground coffee or smaller degrees to get fine-ground coffee.

Attached a drawing of how the movement of the knob moves the bean housing

I’m wondering:
Did I reassemble the adjustment mechanism incorrectly?
Do I have a wrong understanding how the grinder should work? 
Could the thread/spindle or knob coupling be reversed?

Has anyone experienced this?
Any insight or some check how your grinder turns if you use the knob would be super helpful. Thanks!

2) soft shell crab - they don’t give enough lettuce, you’re meant to wrap it like a little taco. Disappointed it was the same sauce as the taro chips. Would get again. 8/10

4) octopus skewers - sauce was good. 7/10

5) duck salad - duck was perfect and the slaw was plentiful- dressing was nothing special. 8/10

6) garlic noodles - honestly didn’t like these. Roasted almost burnt garlic taste and sweet the dish got cold so quickly. Wouldn’t recommend, wish I got the rice instead. 4/10

1m2zly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1m2zly8/no_contact_day/,No contact day,"Me and AP met in high school. We had the same group of friends. My best friend was her best friend’s boyfriend. We knew each other well. 

After high school we were both single, one day we collided. It was like nothing I had ever experienced or even thought possible. We got engaged. It was the best year of my life. I joined the military to straighten out. I was a mess. 

When I was in bootcamp she kissed a guy. I broke off the engagement. At the time all the told me was she “cheated.” If she would have just said she kissed a guy I would have just laughed it off. I didn’t learn that’s all it was until a month ago. Lol. She did everything right though to make amends unprompted. But I couldn’t handle it. I was young and idealistic. 

We kept in touch via phone. Hooked up a few times over the next couple years. The last time was about 17 years ago. I was such an ass. I couldn’t reconcile how much I loved her, and I could not believe it was possible for someone to actually love me back the same way I love them. Then I got sent to the other side of the world for a decade. I was a walking stereotype for alcohol consumption in the military. She started dating other people. I did too. We’re both really risk averse. Always do the “responsible” thing. Risking everything to go across an ocean felt like a risk I couldn’t ask her to take. She would have taken it if I asked. 

Fast forward 17 years. I married someone else. So did she. We both have kids now. We were still in touch all this time. A few days or weeks of messages a couple times a year. Sometimes less. Sometimes more. I never stopped loving her. 

A couple months ago we got coffee. we were talking… a lot. We put it in The context of Schrödinger’s cat. We decided to open the box to see if the cat was alive or dead. So… coffee. And the cats alive. I told her how I had felt all these years. She was stuck in the same pattern wishing she could let me go. 

We spent until yesterday talking constantly. Yes NRE. But she and I always connected on all the levels. She challenges me spiritually. Intellectually. Sexually it was always amazing and that didn’t change. She’s super stable and successful in life. Me too. Solid career. There was just an ocean in between us and we both tried to move on wishing we weren’t moving on from each other. 

We just each thought we were setting the other one free. 

we drew up a plan. Go fix our lives. Give our marriages one last 110% shot. We set a date to go no contact. That was yesterday. We will have coffee in 1 year. Today I move to the other side of the world again. The one time we were within 20 minutes of each other since we split up for more than a few days.

And I’m devastated. I hate that the responsible decision has been my guiding principle in life. I hate myself for never taking a risk or betting on my own happiness. Tomorrow I’ll schedule time with a counselor. But today? I’m mad. I’m sad. I can’t stop crying.

My marriage is “fine I guess.” It hasn’t felt great for me for 10 years. She doesn’t challenge me. Doesn’t have the emotional vocabulary, or much capacity for self reflection. She doesn’t compete with me (in a healthy way) or rise to meet me. She just… exists? Waits for me to meet her with some grand gesture. She says she’s content but how can she be when I’m fucking lonely as hell in my own marriage? Whatever. These are questions for the counselor. ",3,1752837447.0,adultery,4,0.71,False
1m2zlta,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m2zlta/mommy_he_says_hes_my_dad_mom_hugh_wants_to_call/,"Mommy, He Says He's My Dad_ Mom... Hugh wants to call off the wedding,"" she managed to say, her voice cracking before it gave way to quiet sobs.","# 1.Chapter 1 Call Off The Wedding

Melissa Bush stood in the middle of the crowded street, the noise around her barely registering over the chaos in her own head. Her phone buzzed, and when she saw her mom's name, she picked up like it was her last lifeline.

""Mom... Hugh wants to call off the wedding,"" she managed to say, her voice cracking before it gave way to quiet sobs.

""What?!"" Lillian Clayton's voice practically exploded through the phone. ""Melissa, are you serious? The wedding's tomorrow! What the hell happened?""

Every word Melissa forced out felt like tearing open a wound that refused to heal. ""The premarital medical report... it says I'm infertile.""

Her voice wavered, the last word almost choking her. ""But it might be a mistake! Mom, I swear, I never wanted his damn money. I even told him I'd sign a prenup! But he still—"" She cut off, unable to finish, the words catching in her throat.

Her thoughts spiraled, dragging her back to when she and Hugh had first fallen in love. Back in college, he'd been her everything—her rock. As soon as they graduated, he got down on one knee and promised her forever.

Sure, his family had looked down their noses at her modest background, but Hugh never let that shake him. He always made her feel like they were unbreakable.

She couldn't forget that awful summer during her junior year, after the car accident that forced her to take a break from school. The gossip had been brutal—people whispering that she was working shady jobs, or worse, selling herself to make ends meet. It had been hell.

But Hugh stood by her, brushing off the rumors like they were nothing, making it clear to everyone that he was with her, no matter what.

If it weren't for him, those disgusting accusations might've followed her forever.

She'd never had that growing up. Her parents' divorce left her with wounds she didn't even know how to name.

Her mom's fragile health and her stepdad's temper—fueled by booze—made life feel like walking on eggshells every day.

He never cared for the family, only about where his next drink was coming from, and when he got angry, he made sure everyone in the house paid for it.

Marriage, to Melissa, wasn't just about love—it was her ticket to a better life. A safe haven. Not just for her, but for her mom too.

And now? Now she was being thrown away like yesterday's trash because she might not be able to have kids. In this so-called modern world, this was enough to undo everything she and Hugh had built.

The word infertile sent a shiver through Lillian, but she quickly swallowed her shock.

Her voice softened, steady but full of determination. ""Melissa, baby, stop crying. Just come home, okay? We'll figure this out. Together.""

Melissa nodded, even though her tears hadn't stopped. Her mom's voice was like a warm blanket around her frayed nerves, and for the first time all day, she felt a tiny sliver of hope.

At least she still had her mom.

Husband or no husband, Melissa wasn't about to let life chew her up and spit her out. If Hugh wanted out, fine. She'd pick herself up, find a job, and build her own life. She didn't need a savior. She'd be her own hero—and protect her mom in the process.

Melissa pushed open the beat-up door of her dingy little apartment, and the sour, unmistakable stink of alcohol hit her like a slap. She gagged, wrinkling her nose in disgust.

""Drunk again,"" she muttered under her breath, her voice heavy with exhaustion and resignation.

She moved quietly, her steps careful and deliberate, like she was trying to navigate a minefield. All she wanted was to sneak into her room without stirring up the hornet's nest.

""Hey! Don't you fucking move!"" The shout came like a whip crack, sharp and ice-cold, freezing her in place.

Her heart jumped into her throat as she slowly turned around, dread creeping up her spine.

Jack Walton, her stepfather was staggering toward her, weaving unsteadily, but still managing to look threatening as hell. ""So, it's true,"" he growled, his words slurred but still venomous. ""The Wallaker family broke off the damn engagement? What the fuck did you do this time, huh?""

Melissa's stomach churned. Her pulse hammered in her ears as she tried to find the right words to diffuse the situation. Arguing would only make things worse, but she couldn't figure out how she explained something like this.

""I... I need to talk to Mom,"" she stammered, her voice shaking as her eyes darted toward the half-open door of the master bedroom.

She caught a glimpse of Lillian's dress peeking through the crack, and hope surged in her chest. She edged toward the bedroom, desperate for escape. But escape wasn't in the cards.

She'd barely made it two steps when a sharp, searing pain ripped through her scalp. She cried out in shock as Jack's hand yanked her back by the hair.

""Don't you fucking walk away from me!"" he snarled, his grip like iron. ""Answer me, goddamn it! Why did the Wallakers call it off? What'd you do? What's your fucking excuse this time? You cheating on him, you little whore?""

The accusation hit her harder than the pull on her hair. Tears sprang to her eyes as anger and humiliation bubbled to the surface.

""No! That's not true!"" she cried, her voice cracking. ""I wasn't cheating! I was just delivering wedding invitations to my classmates!""

""Bullshit!"" he spat, his voice rising as his hand tightened. ""I saw you yesterday, laughing it up with some guy like you didn't have a care in the fucking world. Don't you dare lie to me!""

Melissa's whole body trembled as she tried to pull away, her voice trembling. ""It wasn't like that! I swear to God!""

He ignored her, his voice growing louder and nastier. ""You think I don't know you? You've been spreading your legs for any guy who looks at you twice! You think I'm blind? Jesus Christ, I actually thought you were trying to clean up your act, but no—same old useless slut! After all I've done for you!

""And now, with the Wallakers out of the picture, you think you can just stay here for free? Hell no. You're gonna start pulling your weight.""

Before she could process his words, he grabbed the front of her shirt and ripped it down the middle.

Melissa gasped, crossing her arms over her chest instinctively. Her entire body shook with terror as she saw the look in his eyes now—hungry, predatory, disgusting.

""No!"" she screamed, thrashing as hard as she could. ""Mom! Mom, help me! Please!"" But the house stayed silent.

Jack laughed, low and mean. ""You really think she's coming to save you? She can hear you just fine, sweetheart. And if she ain't coming out, you already know why. Now, be a good girl, and maybe I won't throw you and your useless mother out on the street.""

Her blood ran cold. She twisted and fought with everything she had, her voice hoarse from screaming. ""Mom! Please! Help me! Mom!""

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught movement. Her mother—Lillian Clayton—was standing in the doorway of the master bedroom, her pale face just visible through the crack.

For one brief, heart-stopping moment, their eyes met. Then the door closed. Softly. Quietly. Finally.

The sound shattered something inside Melissa. She stared at the door, her mind reeling with disbelief. Her chest ached as the betrayal washed over her.

The woman she had sacrificed so much for, fought so hard to protect, had abandoned her. Just like that.

Jack's weight bore down on her, his breath hot and foul against her skin.

Something inside her snapped. The fight drained out of her body, leaving her limp and hollow. Tears streamed down her face as she stared at the closed door, her heart breaking into pieces.

Jack's grin twisted into something vile as Melissa dissolved into despair. He pressed down harder, his weight like a crushing anchor, his hands fumbling clumsily with his belt.

The sour reek of alcohol poured off him, thick and nauseating, choking the air between them. Melissa gagged, bile rising in her throat. 'This isn't happening. It can't be real.' Her chest tightened, panic clawing at her insides.

She twisted her head, desperate for anything—any escape. That's when she saw it: a fruit knife, glinting innocuously on the coffee table just a few feet away.

Her trembling hand darted out, fingers curling around the cold, unforgiving metal. She gripped it tight, but the weight of the blade sent her mind spiraling.

Her stomach churned. She hated blood—hated violence. She couldn't even bring herself to kill a fly, and now she was supposed to stab someone? The thought made her hands freeze, the knife shaking in her grip.

But her stepfather wasn't waiting. His pants were already halfway down his legs, his drunken, clumsy hands yanking and pulling at her clothes.

Something snapped. Melissa let out a broken cry, her chest heaving as she clenched her teeth. Tears blurred her vision, but she didn't care. With a surge of blind, desperate fury, she raised the knife and drove it straight into his back.

""Ah, fuck!"" His scream ripped through the air. He reeled back, clutching at his back as blood seeped through his shirt. He staggered, his breath ragged, but the fury in his eyes only burned hotter.

""You little bitch!"" he snarled, his voice slurred and feral. ""You think this is gonna stop me?!"" He stumbled toward her, hands reaching, his face twisted into something monstrous.

Melissa scrambled to her feet, her whole body shaking like a leaf in the wind. The knife trembled in her hand, its weight unfamiliar and terrifying. ""Stay back!"" she screamed, her voice cracking. ""I swear to God, I'll use it again! Don't fucking come near me!""

But he didn't stop. He wasn't listening. ""You're dead, you hear me? You're fucking dead!"" he roared, spit flying from his lips as he lunged at her.

Melissa's breath hitched. Her legs felt like jelly, her heart pounding so hard it threatened to burst. She shut her eyes tight and thrust the knife forward, blind and wild.

This time, the blade struck true. It plunged into his chest with a sickening crunch. His body jerked, his breath catching in a horrible gurgle.

For a moment, his eyes locked on hers, wide with shock, before the fire drained out of them. He stumbled back, his knees buckling as his weight collapsed into itself. Then he hit the floor. Hard.

Melissa froze. She couldn't move, couldn't breathe. Her fingers went limp, the knife clattering to the floor beside her. The world around her blurred into nothing but the sight of his lifeless body, blood pooling dark and thick beneath him.

Then came the sound of a door slamming open. ""Melissa!"" Her mother's voice ripped through the stillness, sharp and panicked. Lillian stormed into the room, her eyes darting wildly between Melissa and the bloodied corpse on the floor. She marched straight to Melissa, snatched the knife from her hand, and flung it across the room.

""That's your stepfather, you stupid, ungrateful brat!"" Lillian screamed, pointing a trembling finger at the body. ""Do you have any idea what you've just done? He's the one who's kept a roof over our heads all these years! The one who's fed you! And you—what, you just fucking stab him?!""

Melissa stared at her, her cheek throbbing, her chest heaving. The words hit her harder than the slap. Her mother wasn't angry about what had almost happened. She wasn't furious about what he had done.

# 2.Chapter 2 Against The World

Melissa stared down at Jack's lifeless body sprawled on the floor. Blood had already seeped to the tips of her shoes, cold and sticky, clinging like guilt itself.

Her knees gave out, and she crumpled onto the floor, her hands trembling uncontrollably. ""Shit... I killed him. I fucking killed him...""

Melissa, pale as death, clutched at a stray piece of clothing to cover herself, her fingers fumbling like they didn't belong to her anymore. With a ragged breath, she stumbled to her feet, her legs shaky and unsteady.

All she could do was run—out of the house, out of the nightmare she couldn't wake up from.

By the time she reached the bridge, her body was moving, but her mind felt like it wasn't even there anymore. Everything around her was a blur, muted and distant, like she was trapped in someone else's bad dream.

Blood. His face. That awful, sickening finality. She knew it was only a matter of time. The cops were probably already out there, scouring the city, sirens blaring, her name crackling over their radios.

They'd catch her. Drag her into some courtroom where strangers would dissect her life, argue over whether she was a monster or just desperate.

Her eyes drifted to the river below. The water churned and rolled like it was waiting for her, dark and restless. One step. That's all it would take. 'One step, and it's all over,' she thought.

The guilt. The fear. The shame. The suffocating weight of it all. It would disappear the second she sank into the cold depths.

She climbed over the railing, her bare feet gripping the slick metal. Rain was starting to fall now, icy droplets running down her face and soaking her to the bone.

Until she heard it. A sound, faint and almost lost in the wind, but unmistakable. A cry.

Melissa's eyes snapped open. For a moment, she thought she'd imagined it. But then it came again—soft, pitiful, barely audible through the pounding rain.

She turned her head, scanning the bridge. And there it was. A small bundle, not far away, lying forgotten and abandoned in the shadows. It was a baby.

""Waa... waa..."" The cry was weak, fragile, like it barely had the strength to keep going.

Melissa let out a sharp, bitter laugh. 'You've gotta be kidding me,' she muttered under her breath. 'What the hell are you crying about? No one's coming for you, kid. Just like no one's coming for me.'

But the sound of the baby's cries clawed at her, refusing to let go.

She tried to turn back toward the river, to focus on the plan she'd already made. But that tiny, helpless sound stuck to her like a curse. It wound itself around her chest, digging into places she didn't want to feel.

The rain came harder now, pouring in thick sheets, but the baby's cries grew fainter, as though it didn't have much left. Melissa gritted her teeth, her hands clutching the railing until her knuckles turned white.

""Fuck,"" she whispered under her breath. The curse slipped out like a prayer, desperate and raw. She let out a shaky sigh, then swung her legs back over the railing. Her body felt heavy as lead as she staggered toward the tiny bundle.

When she reached it, she dropped to her knees, her heart pounding against her ribs. The baby was so small, wrapped in a damp, dirty blanket, its face pale and cold. It wasn't crying anymore—just making soft, fragile noises, like it didn't have the strength to do anything else.

Melissa hesitated, her hands shaking, before finally reaching out. She pulled the baby into her arms, holding it close. Tentatively, she pressed her finger to its lips, and the baby latched on, sucking weakly.

""You poor little thing,"" she murmured, her voice cracking. Tears welled up in her eyes, mixing with the rain streaming down her face. ""Thrown out like trash, huh? Just like me.""

The baby let go of her finger, its cries starting up again—sharp and desperate, cutting through the rain like a knife. Melissa's heart twisted painfully.

""You're hungry,"" she whispered, her voice breaking. ""I know, I know... I'll figure something out. Just don't give up, okay? Don't give up on me.""

The baby's cries softened a little, but its tiny body was still trembling, fragile and helpless in her arms. Melissa cradled it closer, pressing her cheek to its cold, damp forehead.

""We're both screwed, aren't we?"" she muttered bitterly, her lips twitching into the faintest hint of a smile. ""Left behind. Forgotten.""

'Alright,' she thought, standing on shaky legs. 'Guess we're in this together now. You and me against the world, huh? Let's see if we can make it out of this mess.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Three years later, in a sleepy little town in Lachlan, life trudged along quietly, tucked into the cracks of an old street.

In a shabby house, another chapter of a small, complicated life unfolded.

Melissa, wearing a slightly worn apron, leaned against the window frame. Her tone was firm but still gentle as she called down to the rowdy kids tearing up the yard below. ""Curtis! Dinner's on the table—get your little butt inside!""

Covered in dirt from head to toe, Curtis Bush looked like he'd just climbed out of a mud pit. His toy gun clutched tightly in one hand, he didn't bother looking up. ""Yeah, yeah, I heard you!"" he shouted, too caught up in his pretend war to care.

Melissa exhaled, shaking her head as she turned back into the kitchen. The plates clattered softly as she arranged them on the table. When the doorway stayed empty, her patience hit its limit.

She stormed out onto the balcony, her voice sharp enough to cut through the racket outside. ""Curtis Bush, I said now! Move it!""

The instant she used his full name, every kid in the yard froze. Full-name warnings from a mom meant only one thing: you were about two seconds away from real trouble.

Curtis let out a long, exaggerated sigh. ""Don't go anywhere,"" he said to his friends, sounding like a middle-aged man with too much on his plate. ""I'll eat fast and be back before you even notice I'm gone.""

That cracked the older boys up. They were doubled over, laughing so hard they could barely breathe. ""Curtis is such a little mama's boy!"" one of them howled. ""His mom calls, and he comes running like a scared little puppy!""

""Yeah, other kids are scared of their dads, but Curtis? He's terrified of his mom!""

""And he doesn't even have a dad!"" another chimed in, his voice dripping with mockery.

That hit different. Curtis, halfway to the stairs with a grin on his face, froze mid-step. His smile vanished, replaced by a look that was way too serious for a three-year-old. Slowly, he turned around, his small frame tense like a coiled spring.

""Shut the hell up!"" he yelled, gripping his toy gun so tight his knuckles turned white. ""Don't you dare talk about my mom like that!""

The biggest boy in the group crossed his arms, smirking. He was older, taller, and clearly used to being the boss. ""Or what? Everyone knows your dad ditched you. He's never shown up—not once.""

Another boy snickered, piling on. ""Yeah, and what about that creepy guy down the street? Didn't he say he'd marry your mom? Maybe you should start calling him daddy.""

Curtis might've been little, but he wasn't stupid. He could hear the venom behind their words. This wasn't teasing—it was mean, deliberate, and aimed straight at his heart. His face turned bright red, his whole body shaking with anger.

""You call him daddy! You and your whole family can call him daddy!"" Curtis snapped, his voice cracking.

That just made them laugh harder. ""Why would we? We already have dads,"" one of them shot back, his tone cruel. ""You're the one who doesn't. We were being nice, and now you're acting like a little brat. Maybe your mom does like the lame guy down the street. Maybe she's just waiting to say yes!""

Before Curtis could respond, a new voice cut through the laughter—cold and sharp, like the crack of a whip. ""And what exactly makes you little assholes think you're so special? A bunch of nasty brats with no manners, running your mouths like you own the place. Pathetic.""

The boys whipped around to see Melissa standing at the top of the stairs, her face like thunder. In one hand, she gripped a broom, and she didn't hesitate.

She charged down into the yard, swinging it like she was clearing out pests. The boys scattered, tripping over their own feet as they bolted.

Once the yard was clear, Melissa scooped Curtis up in her arms. But even as she stepped inside, the sound of gossip drifted through the thin walls of the neighborhood.

""She's got some damn nerve, acting all high and mighty,"" someone muttered loud enough to be heard. ""Everyone knows she doesn't even know who the kid's dad is. Bringing their mess here like it's not a disgrace.""

Melissa's jaw clenched so hard it hurt. But her grip on Curtis didn't falter, and her pace didn't slow. She refused to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Back inside, she set Curtis down, finally noticing the way his lip was trembling and his little hands were clenched into fists. He wasn't crying, but his face was pale, and his big eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She knelt in front of him, resting her hands on his shoulders. ""Hey,"" she said softly, her voice steady even though her heart was breaking. ""my little guy, no tears, okay? We didn't do anything wrong. You hear me? Nothing. So don't you cry.""

Curtis hiccupped through his sobs, his little shoulders trembling. ""Mom...I just... I wish Dad was still here..."" His voice broke as he dissolved into hiccupping sobs.

The words hit her like a freight train. Melissa fought to keep the sharp sting of pain off her face. She'd worked so hard to keep Curtis from thinking about the man she was so desperate to forget.

It had been years since she'd grabbed her baby and run, fleeing to Lachlan, the middle of nowhere, to escape a life she could never go back to.

She'd spun a careful story, telling Curtis that his dad was a truck driver who'd died in an accident shortly after they were married. A clean, simple lie to keep him from asking questions that could lead to answers too dangerous to speak out loud.

Melissa hugged him closer, her voice steady despite the lump in her throat. ""Baby, your daddy's watching over us from heaven. He loves you so much, Curtis, and he wouldn't want to see you sad like this. Okay?""

Curtis sniffled and nodded, his wide, tear-filled eyes searching hers. ""I don't want Daddy to be sad...""

Her heart twisted again, but before she could say more, a car horn cut through the heavy quiet outside.

Normally, Curtis would've been off her lap in a flash, rushing to the balcony to see what kind of car it was. He was obsessed with cars—he could pick out makes and models just from the sound of an engine.

But today, he stayed put, burrowing deeper into her arms.

Melissa forced a smile and kissed the top of his head. ""Come on, buddy. Let's go see what's out there, huh? Maybe it's something cool.""

She stood and carried him to the balcony. Her eyes instantly locked on two sleek black sedans sitting in her dusty front yard.

Her stomach sank when she caught sight of the license plates—Chassis. A city miles away, too far for this to be a casual visit.

Her mind started racing. She hadn't seen a car from Chassis in years. Memories she'd buried long ago surged to the surface: the blood pooling on the floor, her stepfather's cold, lifeless body.

'Why now? Why here? Have they finally caught up with me?' she thought in a picnic.

Melissa's grip on Curtis tightened as dread washed over her. Back then, she'd had nothing to lose, no one to protect but herself.

But now, everything was different. She had Curtis. The thought of leaving him behind, of him facing this cruel world without her, was unbearable.

Her instinct screamed at her to retreat, to grab her boy and run again, but before she could so much as step back, the rear door of one of the sedans creaked open.

And out stepped a man. Melissa froze.

The summer heat shimmered around him, but he looked utterly untouched by it, his crisp, tailored suit clinging to his broad shoulders and lean frame like it was made for him.

His every movement was smooth, deliberate, exuding an effortless confidence that couldn't be faked. He wasn't just handsome; he was devastating.

He paused to adjust his cuffs with a deliberate, practiced ease before lifting his head. His eyes swept across the balcony. And then his gaze locked on her.

Melissa felt her breath hitch. His eyes were cold and unnervingly sharp, like he could see right through her.

# 3.Chapter 3 Got Moore Blood In You

Melissa bolted back into the house from the balcony, her movements sharp and hurried. ""Curtis, wash up—it's dinner time,"" she called, keeping her tone as steady as she could manage.

But her mind was miles away. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't shake the image of that car's license plate or the unnervingly intense stare of the man behind the wheel. A prickly, unfamiliar unease coiled in her gut, refusing to let go.

The knock at the door came suddenly, loud and aggressive, making her flinch. Her pulse skyrocketed, a cold sweat breaking out along her spine.

For a moment, she just stood there, frozen, her breathing shallow. Relax, she told herself, even as her hand shook slightly when she reached for the doorknob.

She opened the door—and there he was. The man from the car.

Tall and broad-shouldered, he filled the doorway with an imposing presence that made her instinctively want to step back. His cologne hit her first—subtle, expensive, and irritatingly familiar.

It stirred a memory she couldn't quite place, like a ghost brushing past her. Her stomach tightened. She didn't know him. She was sure of that.

But there was something about the way he stood, so calm and self-assured, like he owned the damn world, that sent a chill rippling through her.

Melissa gripped the doorframe for support and forced herself to speak. ""Can I help you? Are you... looking for someone?""

The man's eyes locked onto hers, steady and unyielding. ""Yeah,"" he said, his voice low and deliberate. ""You.""

That single word knocked the air out of her lungs. She blinked, trying to gather her thoughts, her grip tightening. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said quickly, her voice a little too high-pitched to sound convincing.

His lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. ""No, I don't. Melissa Bush. Don't tell me you've forgotten what you did three years ago.""

Her heart stopped. Just like that, her world tipped on its axis. Three years ago. The words crashed into her like a truck, dredging up memories she'd fought so hard to bury.

Her eyes darted toward the living room, toward Curtis's toys scattered on the floor. 'If he knows...' Her chest tightened painfully. 'If they take me... Curtis. What happens to him?'

Her hands trembled at the thought. The idea of her little boy being ripped from her, tossed into foster care, growing up alone—it was unbearable.

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" she said, but her voice cracked halfway through. Her pale face and shaking hands told a different story.

The man, Bradley Moore, rolled his eyes, his patience clearly nonexistent. ""Cut the bullshit,"" he said, his tone sharp enough to slice through her weak protest.

Before she could respond, he shoved the door open, brushing past her like it was his house, not hers.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Melissa snapped, scrambling to block his path. ""Get out! You can't just barge into someone's house!""

He ignored her completely. His sharp eyes swept over the modest living room, taking in every detail.

The mismatched furniture, the small dining table with two steaming plates, the bookshelf crammed with kids' books—it all painted a picture of a simple, quiet life.

His gaze landed on the toy bin overflowing with blocks and stuffed animals. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.

Without a word, he strolled to the couch and sank into it like he owned the thing, one arm casually slung over the backrest. He patted the seat next to him, raising an eyebrow. ""Sit.""

Melissa bristled, her jaw tightening as she stood frozen by the door. She didn't move. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said again, her voice cold but tight with unease. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees, his gaze locked on her like a predator sizing up prey. ""Three years,"" he said slowly, his tone almost conversational. ""It took me three goddamn years to find you. You think I'm leaving without what's mine?""

Melissa's face twisted in a mix of confusion and disbelief as her thoughts tumbled over each other. ""What's mine? What the hell does he mean? Wait a second—he's not a cop? He didn't come here to bust me?'

The whirlwind of questions sparked an unexpected surge of boldness, and before she could think twice, the words flew out of her mouth. ""What the hell are you even talking about? I don't know you, I've never seen you before in my life!""

His expression darkened, and the air in the room seemed to drop a few degrees. ""Give me back my son.""

The words hit like a sledgehammer. For a second, Melissa forgot how to breathe. She staggered back, her hand gripping the edge of the dining table for support.

""Your... son?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley's patience had clearly hit its limit. He turned, motioning toward the bathroom door where a pair of curious little eyes peeked through the crack. ""Milton, come here.""

Melissa could only watch, frozen, as the door creaked open and Curtis stepped out hesitantly. A cold, paralyzing fear gripped her chest.

There was something undeniable between this man and her son—some unspoken, invisible link she couldn't ignore.

Curtis shuffled over to her, his tiny hand clutching the hem of her shirt like a lifeline. ""Mommy, who's that man?""

Melissa pulled him close, holding him tight against her. Her gaze never left Bradley, every fiber of her being screaming caution.

'But... hadn't Curtis been abandoned as a baby? Wasn't there a note in his blanket—'We can't afford to raise him'—a cold, heartless explanation for why he'd been left behind?' she mused internally.

And yet, here stood this man, driving a car worth more than most people's houses. He didn't look like someone who couldn't afford a pack of diapers.

More than that, his whole presence, his every movement, oozed wealth and sophistication. That wasn't something you could fake, let alone pick up in a couple of years.

Melissa hadn't even managed to come up with a lie to soothe Curtis when Bradley's voice cut through the tension. ""I'm your father.""

The words landed like a punch to the gut. She'd had her suspicions, sure—but hearing him say it out loud? It knocked the air out of her lungs. Her knees wobbled, and she nearly hit the floor.

Her body shook uncontrollably, trembling like a leaf caught in a storm.

On paper, she was the one who had saved Curtis when he was abandoned as a baby. But in truth, he'd been the one keeping her alive all these years, the reason she fought so hard just to survive.

Melissa opened her mouth, but no words came out. All she could do was hold Curtis tighter, as though sheer force could shield him from whatever was coming.

""You're my dad?"" Curtis's eyes sparkled with cautious excitement, his voice full of innocent curiosity.

Bradley's lips curved into the slightest smile, clearly satisfied with the reaction. ""That's right.""

Curtis tilted his head, studying the man as if trying to solve a puzzle. Finally, he blurted out, ""But... aren't you supposed to be dead?""

Bradley's brow twitched slightly. His gaze flicked toward Melissa, who stood frozen like a statue. Then he turned back to Curtis. ""What else did she tell you?""

Curtis's little fingers began counting as he answered earnestly, ""She said you're a super good driver, you can cook, and... you love her a lot!""

Bradley's lips curled into a sharp, mocking smile. ""Take all the time you need,"" he drawled, his tone cool and cutting. ""You'll figure out soon enough what kind of man your father really is.""

His words hit like a slap. Curtis, wide-eyed and hesitant, turned to Melissa, his voice trembling with confusion. ""Mommy... is he really my daddy? He's alive?""

Melissa froze, panic overtaking her. She shook her head so hard it was a wonder it didn't come loose. ""No, no, he's not—he's not your daddy!""

Bradley's expression darkened in an instant, the air in the room seeming to drop several degrees. His voice was icy and sharp. ""So, not only are you a thief, but you're a liar too?""

Melissa's shaking grew worse. She looked small, fragile, as she stumbled over her words. ""No, no... it's not like that... I didn't steal... he's mine...""

Her voice broke, and tears brimmed in her eyes. She looked so small, so helpless, that Curtis's chest tightened. This wasn't the mommy he knew—the strong, loving, sometimes stern mommy who always had everything under control. Right now, she looked broken.

Something clicked in Curtis's young mind. This man—this tall, scary man with his harsh words and cruel eyes—had to be a bad guy.

With sudden determination, Curtis stepped forward, planting his small body in front of Melissa. He threw his arms out as wide as they would go and glared up at Bradley. ""You're a bad man!"" he shouted, his voice shaking but firm. ""You're not my daddy! Get out of my house!""

Bradley's eyes narrowed, his irritation flashing like lightning. His voice turned sharper, louder. ""Ungrateful little brat! Protecting an outsider? I'm your father, whether you like it or not.""

Curtis flinched but didn't back down. His little jaw tightened as he stomped over to the corner, grabbing his toy gun.

Though his hands trembled, he aimed it straight at Bradley, his face set in childish defiance. ""You're lying! You're a bad man, and you can't hurt my mommy! Get out, or—or I'll shoot you!""

Bradley blinked, startled for a split second, before a deep laugh rumbled from his chest. ""Well, well,"" he said, amusement flickering in his cold eyes. ""At least you've got some Moore blood in you.""

For a moment, Curtis faltered, lowering the toy gun slightly. That hesitation was all Bradley needed. In one swift move, he reached out, grabbed the toy gun from Curtis's hands, and tossed it aside without a second thought.

His smirk vanished as his voice turned razor-sharp. ""Enough of this bullshit."" Snapping his fingers, he signaled to the two men waiting just outside the door. ""Take them.""

Chaos erupted instantly. Before Melissa could react, Bradley scooped Curtis up in one arm, his grip unyielding.

The two large men stormed in, each grabbing one of Melissa's arms and lifting her off the ground like she weighed nothing.

The room filled with frantic screams.

""Curtis!"" Melissa cried, her voice raw with desperation.

""Mommy! Mommy, I want my mommy!"" Curtis yelled, his small fists pounding against Bradley's chest.

Tears streamed down Curtis's face as he fought with everything he had, but Bradley's hold was like steel. Desperation surged in him, and with no other option, he sank his teeth into Bradley's neck, biting down as hard as he could.

# 4.Chapter 4 She's Not Your Mother

""Hiss—"" Bradley winced in pain, his gaze turning sharp as a knife. ""You little brat, is this how she's been teaching you?""

Curtis glared at him, fists clenched in fury. ""You're not my dad! Let go of me!""

Bradley's voice hardened, low and threatening. ""Listen up, Milton Moore. I'm your real father. That woman? She's not your mother!""

The words hit Curtis like a punch to the gut. He completely lost it, thrashing wildly, kicking and screaming. ""Liar! She is my mom! Let go of me, you bastard!""

'How could she not be my mother?' Curtis's panic surged, his cries becoming even louder, more desperate.

Bradley, completely losing his patience, gripped the bloodstained spot on his neck and pulled Curtis in even tighter.

Outside, a luxury car stood parked in the driveway. The noise upstairs was enough to draw a crowd, and soon, the yard was full of nosy neighbors, whispering and gossiping.

Curtis was shoved into one car, while Melissa was taken to another.

An elderly woman, watching the chaos unfold, finally gathered the courage to speak. ""Who the hell are you people? You can't just steal people like this... it's illegal!""

Bradley remained unfazed, casually pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the blood from his neck. ""I'm working a case. Mind your own business.""

The crowd quickly pieced it together, and whispers spread like wildfire.

""No wonder no one ever visits them. They must be hiding out because they're running from the law.""

""Oh my God, my kid's always hanging out with that troublemaker. I hope he doesn't get dragged into something bad.""

The crowd muttered, pointing at Melissa, who was banging on the car window, fighting to break free.

The car tore off, kicking up dust as it sped away.

After what felt like forever, Melissa, exhausted from crying, realized there was no way out. She stopped, her sobs turning into quiet sniffles.

Her red, swollen eyes narrowed at Bradley. ""Pretending to be a cop? That's a crime.""

Bradley Moore turned to her with a smirk, his tone teasing. ""When did I say I was a cop?""

Melissa shot back, biting with anger. ""You said you were working a case!""

Bradley chuckled darkly. ""What, a private investigator can't investigate a case?""

Melissa was left speechless, caught off guard.

Bradley pulled out an iPad, swiping it to pull up her information. ""Melissa Bush. Graduated from Chassis University. You were supposed to marry your boyfriend, but canceled the wedding the day before.""

He gave her a mocking smile. ""The media even covered it for a couple of days.""

Melissa looked at the screen, her nerves suddenly shot to hell.

It was obvious that Bradley hadn't dug deep enough into her past. If he had, he would've known the one thing that kept her up at night: the murder of her stepfather.

That secret was enough to bring her to her knees.

Melissa took a deep breath, her voice tight. ""What the hell do you want from me?""

Bradley's eyes were as cold as ice. ""Can't you figure it out? I want you to bring my son back and, while you're at it, I need you to tell me what the hell you've been doing all this time.""

Melissa fought to keep her composure. ""Are you seriously Curtis's real father?""

""He's Milton Moore!"" Bradley snapped, his tone sharp.

Melissa raised an eyebrow. ""And why the hell should I believe you?""

Bradley's voice dropped to a chilling, flat tone. ""We'll do a DNA test. You can take one too, if it makes you feel better.""

Melissa's heart skipped a beat. She knew well she wasn't related to Curtis by blood, and there was no way she was going near a DNA test.",1,1752837433.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

However my favorite has to be the mocha coffee flavor. I also got a 3 back of the protein coffee. I think I found my new favorite thing. I drink a shake for breakfast, oats overnight for lunch and have a small dinner. I have my shake at 7am, lunch between 11am & noon, dinner at 4pm. And try not to eat after 6pm. The oats have 20g protein. You just pour in any choice of milk to the spoon or sip line. Let sit in the fridge over night, then enjoy. If you’re already using oo what’s your favorite flavor?

He doesn't work exactly at our department but comes to few meetings here and there. From the first time I saw him I felt this strong attraction, both emotionally and physically. He seemed warm, open, kind.  I developed a crush for limerence as few people call it.

I finally took up the courage to add him on facebook and ask him out for a coffee and he said yes. I met him last Saturday and i was so excited. The conversation was going well when he said he had never been in a relationship and that he is avoidant. (He is also a psychologist), he also mentions he doesn't like the responsibility that comes with having kids and showed me a tattoo of him where it was written ""Leave me Alone"". Then he mentions he has ADHD and that he is gay. Also he is moving to another city by December for maybe next year.

I was so shocked and disappointed by all that. The image I had of him shattered. He saw me being surprised by him saying he was gay and told me he thought it was obvious and I said I didn't see that and that I liked him romantically. He said he felt guilty, and I could see at that point that he showed compassion. He said I was a pretty woman and that had he not been gay, he would have dated me. By the end of the meeting he gave me a hug and left. I saw him at work and he didn't say anything to me and haven't texted me since.

A part of me is grieving, specially that the mental image I had of him when I was in limerence is not there anymore. He never existed. A part of me wants him to text me, but also I wish I never saw him again so I could move on. I have been feeling so down and sad and disappointed. He hasn't texted me since we went out, and he saw me at work at a meeting and didn't talk to me.",2,1752837294.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Mr. Fleming, please, take it easy..."" On her birthday, Celeste Rodriguez witnessed her husband, Trevor Fleming, kissing another woman deeply, his hand relentlessly moving under the woman's skirt.  
Standing outside the office, overhearing this scene, Celeste's eyes filled with tears, her face pale with shock. She had loved this man for seven years, loving him so much that she gave up her career, abandoned her dreams, and wasted the best years of her life. This time, she decided to let go...

After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman—even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.  
I scoffed at the years I’d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,  
“Divorce? Not a chance.”  
\*\*\*  
When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends—but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn’t back yet. Miss Jordyn’s upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I’m busy.""  
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste’s throat tightened. Jordyn didn’t look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow—""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don’t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order—""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he’s busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""  
A woman’s voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he’d always been cold. Distant. Impatient.  
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn’t bother.  
Perhaps she was just too tired.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn’t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn’t answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What’s up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No “Happy birthday.” She wasn’t surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She’s always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That’s hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn’t even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she’d brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.  
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch’s canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should’ve known. Trevor always canceled on her. His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she’d cry. Today, she just felt… empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.

Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream—but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming’s pressure, he never would’ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo—her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn’t seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done—with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind—and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she’d been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
“Hello?”  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.“That offer still stand?”“I’m in.”  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.  
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
…  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
…  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
…  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
…  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.  
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.  
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
…  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.  
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.  
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
…  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
…  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.  
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty—Celeste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.  
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.  
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""

That’s what I said. Or something like it.
Knowing me, it was probably louder, meaner. I probably slammed the steering wheel for good measure, like the train would care.

I like to imagine I said something more poetic when it all began. Something that would sound good carved on a headstone, or at least look good on a screen if anyone ever finds this post. Something like “And so began the night that never ended.” But I doubt I did. I probably just sat there, muttering curses at a freight train that had no business being that long.

Funny, the things you remember and the things you don’t.
But that’s how it started. Just a guy in a car, waiting at a crossing for a train to pass. Nothing dramatic. Nothing special. Until it was.

I’ve been stuck in this… whatever you want to call it… for—
I don’t even know how long anymore. The clock on my dashboard froze at 11:48 p.m. the first night. Or what I think was night. It still is now. Same rain sliding down the windshield like it’s been looping on repeat. Same train, rattling along those tracks.

And me? I’ve gone from cursing to begging to just… talking into this little screen like someone might actually read this someday. So, yeah. If you’re reading this, congratulations. You’re on the outside. Keep it that way.

Because in here… there’s no outside. There’s only the train.

---

You probably want to know why I was out there that night. Why I left the city, drove two hours through pouring rain for a family dinner that I could've skipped with a simple text.

Truth? I wanted to make things right. Really make things right this time.

Not just to look better. Not to show up, smile, and let them think I was on the straight and narrow just long enough for them to slip me a helping hand—a few bucks to get me through a “rough patch”—before I disappeared again, crawling back into the same old cycle. I’ve done that before. Too many times.

But this time was different. I wasn’t chasing a bailout. I wasn’t looking for pity. I wanted to stand there and make them believe me when I said I’d changed—because I had to. Because if I didn’t, I wasn’t just going to lose them for good. I was going to lose myself for good.

Sarah wasn’t just my sister growing up—she was my best friend. Back when the world was small and safe, when the biggest fight we had was over who got the last Pop-Tart. We shared everything—secrets whispered in the dark, dumb inside jokes no one else would ever get.

And I loved her. God, I loved her. Always did. I just never knew how to show it.
My way of saying I care was… well, it was kid stuff. Switching the sugar in her cereal for salt. Stealing her diary so she’d chase me down the hall. Acting like an asshole when she brought home her first boyfriend because I didn’t know what else to do with the feeling that she might matter to someone else more than she did to me.

That was me. All swagger and no clue how to love without screwing it up.

And then I got older, and the stakes got higher. The drinking started—just a few beers to take the edge off, right? Then more. Then pills when the booze didn’t cut it. Before long, I was spiraling and lying to everyone about how fine I was, while Sarah kept showing up. Kept calling. Kept saying You’re not alone in this.

And every time she did, I hated myself more. Because I wanted to be better, but I didn’t want to need saving. I didn’t want to sit there with Mom looking at me like she’d failed somehow, or Dad trying to fix things with his tight-lipped silence, like if he didn’t talk about it, it might just go away.

I love them too—Mom with her casseroles and worried eyes, Dad with his hard hands and harder opinions—but every time I saw them, all I felt was shame. Like they were taking turns holding up a mirror I didn’t want to look into.

And the more they tried to help, the worse it got. Every phone call, every quiet intervention, every “we’re here for you”—it all just made me sink deeper. Because the more they cared, the smaller I felt. The smaller I felt, the more I drank. The more I drank, the more they cared. Round and round it went, until it wasn’t love anymore, not to me. It was a noose. A loop I couldn’t break.

Sounds familiar now. A track with no crossing, running circles around me.

But this time… this time was different.
I’d hit bottom hard a few weeks back. Hard enough to scare me sober. Hard enough to make me crawl out by my fingernails and swear I was done for good. For once, I wasn’t lying—not to them, not to myself. I was clean. Fragile, yeah. But clean. And I thought maybe, just maybe, I could make them believe in me again.

Especially Sarah.

---

So I drove down. Had dinner with Sarah and Mark—the guy I’ve barely spoken to since their wedding. Mom was there too, filling the kitchen with the smell of roast and cinnamon, just like when we were kids. The house hadn’t changed much. It was the one we grew up in, the one Dad left us when he passed. Sarah bought out my half after the funeral, and I told myself I’d use the money to start fresh. Instead, I burned through most of it on pills and powder, chasing numbness.

It was awkward at first, sure. All the smiles a little too tight, the jokes a little forced. But somewhere between the second round of coffee and Mom bringing out her famous apple crumble, the edges softened. We started laughing for real. Talking for real.

And for a while—just a little while—it felt like stepping back in time. Back before the drinking. Before the late-night phone calls and slammed doors. Back before the divorce. Back before Dad was gone for good. Just a family at the table, like nothing had ever cracked or broken.

Sarah was different, too. She didn’t say anything outright—she never does—but it was in the way she looked at me. Like maybe she believed me this time. Like maybe she felt the change before I even said a word about it.

And I felt it too. That quiet thread between us that used to be unbreakable, humming again. Stronger. I thought, this is it. This is the turning point. This time, I’m going to make it.

We didn’t talk about the past. Didn’t need to. Sometimes silence says more than all the words in the world.

When I left, she hugged me tight. Longer than she had in years. And I drove off thinking—for the first time in forever—that maybe the ground under me was finally solid.

Just a drive home.
Just a guy with a second chance, heading down a dark road, rain spitting on the windshield.

And then I stopped at those goddamn blinking red lights.

---

I sat there, watching them strobe against the rain-slicked road, painting everything in angry red. The crossing arms were already down when I rolled up, and the train was already thundering by—boxcar after boxcar, hissing and clanging through the dark.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. Just another train on another cold night. I drummed the wheel, scrolled through my playlists, tried to pretend the seconds weren’t stretching like rubber bands.

But they were.
Still going.
Boxcar after boxcar. No break in the line, just freight, rolling on and on like it had no place better to be.

That’s when the itch started. The one in the base of my skull. I’ve never been good at waiting. Not when there’s another option. Even a bad one.

So I threw it in drive, swung a U-turn, and headed for the back roads.

I knew these streets like the lines on my palm. Grew up out here, cutting through gravel lanes and narrow curves to shave five minutes off a bike ride. I figured I could chase the tail of the train, maybe find a crossing past the last car. Wouldn’t save me any real time, but at least I’d be moving. At least I’d feel like I had some control.

That was the plan. Just a little detour. Nothing more.

The road curved through dark fields, slick with rain, my wipers thudding slow against the glass. I told myself the next crossing couldn’t be far. The tail of the train had to be close by now.

I turned onto County Road 7, tires hissing over puddles, and then—there it was.
A smear of red in the distance, pulsing through the trees like a warning heartbeat.

The lights. Still flashing.

“Jesus Christ,” I muttered, slamming my palm against the wheel. I hit the brakes hard, felt the car skid a little before it caught. My jaw clenched. Screw this.

I threw it in reverse, cranking the wheel sharp until I was nosed back toward the main road. Gravel spat out behind me as I punched the gas and swung into an adjacent street, heading for the third crossing I knew was out past Miller’s Creek. A long shot, but at least it was something.

It was further than I remembered. Roads darker, narrower. The rain tapped steady against the glass as I wound through tight curves, headlights carving pale ribbons through the wet night.

By the time I saw the crossing ahead, my shoulders were knotted tight, and my teeth hurt from grinding them.

And then I saw it.
Those same red lights, glowing like the gates of hell, cutting through the dark.

Still blocked. Still going.

I pulled up close this time, killed the engine, let the wipers freeze mid-swipe. The train roared by, boxcars hammering the night. No end. No break. Just iron rolling forever.

Fine. Bite the bullet. Wait it out.

I sat back, exhaled hard, and finally let myself check the dash clock.
11:48.

My chest tightened. The numbers sat there, sharp and green, like they were carved into the screen. 11:48. Same as when I first hit the lights.

“What the hell…”

I slapped the plastic with my palm, harder than I meant to. The green digits flickered for a second, then settled right back into place. 11:48.

It made me think of Dad, back in his chair years ago, giving the old TV a quick tap on the side whenever the picture went fuzzy. Not a hard hit—just enough to make the static clear and the world snap back into focus. Somehow, it always worked for him.

Not this time.

For a second, I thought maybe I’d misremembered. Maybe I’d had a few too many drinks and time slipped past me without me noticing. God knows that’s happened before.

But then it hit me. I don’t drink anymore. Haven’t in weeks. Haven’t touched a drop since the last time I swore I was done.

So why the hell was it still 11:48?

I pulled my phone from my jacket, thumbed it awake, the glow harsh in the dark car.

11:48.

I opened up social.

Posts slid past under my thumb: video of a dog in a Halloween costume, someone’s new kitchen backsplash, a guy from high school humblebragging about his second rental property. Normal stuff. Comfortable stuff.

I kept scrolling. And scrolling.

After a while, the feed thinned out. Fewer posts, longer gaps. Then the spinning wheel, the little refresh chirp—
and nothing.

You’ve reached the end.

Huh.

I hit refresh. The screen blinked, then snapped back to where I’d started. Same golden retriever in a bumblebee suit. Same backsplash. Same rental property.

I frowned, flicked through again. Same thing. Again and again, like the whole world froze mid-scroll.

Signal bars were solid. Wi-Fi off. Data fine. Everything fine—
except nothing was changing.
Although the dog was cute, I grew tired of the same feed. And that realtor’s fake smile was starting to get under my skin. I locked the screen, slid the phone back into my pocket.

Screw it. I’d just double back to my sister’s place. Spend another half hour there before I tried the road again. Might as well.

I swung the car around and headed back the way I’d come. The rain whispered against the glass as I let myself drift down the old roads, the ones I hadn’t seen in years. A little trip through memory lane.

---

The park came first—the one with the crooked slide and rusted swing set. I slowed as I passed, staring through the wet blur at the dark silhouette of the jungle gym.

God, I hadn’t thought about that day in forever—me and Kyle, two idiots lying on the grass behind the equipment, trying mushrooms for the first time. I remembered stretching my hand out in front of my face, feeling the breeze against my palm every time I exhaled. Something so small, so ordinary, felt… incredible. Like proof I could make something happen, even if it was just moving the air.

We laughed until our ribs ached.

The road curved, pulling me past a neighborhood I used to know too well. I slowed a little, watching rows of dark houses blur through the rain.

Back then, I used to sneak into this place with people I called friends. We’d slip through the shadows, testing car doors, whispering like we were in some high-stakes heist instead of a couple of dumb kids in hoodies.

GPS units, loose change, the odd phone charger—whatever we could find. The plan was always the same: sell it all at school, make a quick buck, live large.

We never sold a single thing. Just ended up with glove-box junk rattling around under our beds like trophies.

Funny how quick you convince yourself it’s harmless. No one gets hurt. Everybody does it.

---

I pulled into the driveway. All the lights were off inside the house. No big deal. It was late—they were probably asleep by now.

I was about to throw it in reverse when my headlights slid across the car in the driveway.

I froze.

The beams crawled over metal that didn’t make sense—pitted, eaten through in patches like it had been sitting out for decades. The tires sagged flat, splitting at the seams. Rust bled across the doors like rot.

For a second, I wondered if I’d pulled into the wrong place. My stomach knotted as I checked the address on the house.

It was my childhood home. No doubt about it.

The white paint I’d seen not too long ago was curling away in strips, exposing gray, splintered wood beneath. Shingles sagged like loose scabs, some torn off entirely, leaving the roof raw and jagged.

I shoved the gear into park and stepped out.

The air smelled like wet earth—and something else. Something stale.

I moved around the front of the car, headlights throwing my shadow long across the yard. That’s when I saw the grass. It reached almost to my knees in places, bending heavy with water. Thick, tangled, and wild, like nobody had touched it in months.

A busted flowerpot lay by the steps, soil spilled out and washed thin. The welcome mat was still there, but its edges had curled and frayed, the lettering faded to a ghost of a word.

My stomach turned as I climbed the steps, each board groaning under my weight.

The door wasn’t locked. It gave under my hand with a tired sigh.

That’s when the smell hit me.

Rot and mildew, thick enough to coat the back of my throat. It felt alive, like the house was breathing it at me, pushing it into my lungs.

I stepped inside, the floor soft under my shoes, like the boards had been drinking the damp for years.

I moved farther in, the beam from the headlights slicing through the living room just enough to show shapes. The couch hunched under a film of gray, cushions sagging, fabric split along the seams.

Then I saw the table.

It was still set for dinner. Plates, glasses, silverware—all where we’d left them. Except now, the food was drowned in a shallow pool of murky water. The potatoes had shriveled to hard, wrinkled husks, their skin splitting like old parchment. Scattered across the table were chunks of meat, or what was left of them—rotting away in a state of quiet decay. A slick pinkish slime clung to the surface, dripping in slow threads down the edges of the plates, pooling on the table like diluted blood.

Maggots writhed in pale clusters, burrowing through soft tissue, shifting the meat as if feeding it life. From above came the faint, rhythmic patter of water trickling through the roof, each drop carving tiny craters into the dusty surface before spreading into the stagnant puddle below.

A drowned candle leaned against the edge of a cracked plate. Dust clung to everything like frost, soft and heavy. The warm scent of sweet cinnamon that once filled the room was gone, replaced by the musty stench of damp rot and spoiled flesh.

“Sarah?” My voice scraped out rough, too loud in the suffocating stillness. “Mark?”

Nothing.

Just the hush of an empty house swallowing my words like fireworks that never went off.


---

I don’t know how many days have passed. Feels like days, anyway. The sky hasn’t changed—still that starless black stretching over me like a lid. The rain hasn’t let up either, ticking against the windshield in the same slow rhythm, like time itself forgot how to move.

I’ve been driving. Circling the town, the backroads, the interstate on-ramps—every route I can think of. All of them feed me back to the same place: the tracks, the train grinding on, endless and indifferent.

Sometimes I swear I’m on roads that never had rails before—streets I know by heart—but there they are, steel lines cutting through the asphalt like scars.

Once, I left the car and started walking. Followed the train for what felt like hours, rain dripping down my collar, boots sucking in the mud. That’s when I saw it—places where the tracks tore straight through buildings. Houses split down the middle. Barns crumpled like cardboard. No detours, no hesitation. Just the line and the weight behind it, carving through everything like it had always been there.

Like it wasn’t following a map. Like it was making the world fit its path.

The gas gauge hasn’t budged. Not an inch. Same with the clock on the dash. Same with everything.

I’ve slept a couple of times—at least, I think I did—but it’s not the same as real sleep. My eyes close, I drift, then I’m awake again with no memory of dreams, no feeling of rest. I don’t get hungry. Don’t get thirsty. Maybe that’s a blessing.

I’ve tried calling—911, friends, family. The calls go through—rings and rings—but no one ever picks up. I even left voicemails, rambling, begging, threatening. Nothing. Not even a callback.

It’s like the world went silent and left me here to rot in the noise.


---

One night—or whatever you’d call it—I was parked in front of those damn blinking lights again. Just sitting there, watching them pulse like they were mocking me.

I had my phone in my hand, thumb scrolling out of habit. For what had to be the thousandth time, I watched Barker in that stupid little bumblebee costume. His ears poking through the striped hood, his tail wagging like a metronome.

I almost smiled. Almost.

Then something different happened.

A break.

Just for a second, like the train had stuttered—like its endless spine had a missing vertebra.

My heart slammed hard enough to make me dizzy.

I dropped the phone in my lap and leaned forward, squinting into the blur. Trying to track the end, to see if it was real or if my brain was just playing tricks.

I saw it. The end of this infernal machine, closely followed by its head, chasing its own tail like a dog.

After that, I couldn’t think about anything else.


---

I spent what felt like the next few days driving. Hunting. Looking for the perfect spot. A crossing with no trees creeping in from the sides, no buildings blocking the horizon. A stretch of open land where I could see the train coming from as far as possible.

Because now I knew what I had to do.

The gap was real. I saw it. I just needed to hit it at the right moment. Slide through that sliver of nothing and pray it spits me out somewhere that makes sense. Somewhere that isn’t here.

Every time I found a crossing, I parked. Watched. Counted cars until my eyes burned, memorized the rhythm like a hymn. Then moved on when the angle wasn’t right, when the sightlines weren’t long enough.

Day after day—if you can even call them that—me and those blinking red lights, trying to turn hope into math.

With each loop, I grew more familiar with my jailer. I knew its order, its colors, the texture of its passage. After the fifty-three cars of lumber came the graffiti of a devil, its horns curling across rusted steel like an omen scrawled in haste. Seventy-eight cars later, the gas tanks—white, bloated, and silent, carrying whatever fumes keep this world burning.

And then, after what felt like days, I saw it again—the gap. Barely twenty feet of open track, a narrow wound in the endless steel. Through it, I caught a glimpse of the horizon, a strip of light that didn’t belong in this endless night. But as soon as it came, the engine swallowed it whole, sliding forward like it was devouring the tracks ahead of it.

I started practicing. Over and over, timing the gap like it was a doorway that only opened for a breath. Each time it came, I slammed the accelerator, tires screaming against the asphalt, the wheel shuddering under my grip. My pulse would spike as the twenty feet of open track rushed toward me—freedom framed in steel.

And then the brake. Hard. Every muscle in my leg straining as the car shrieked and shuddered, stopping with only a few feet to spare before iron blurred past my windshield. The gap would vanish, swallowed by the engine that came sliding in like it was erasing my mistake.

I told myself I’d get it next time, but it’s hard to practice something you can only accomplish once. In the end, there’s no trick to it—just commit, jump into the abyss, and believe you’ll make it through.


---

I’m waiting for the next loop, writing this down like a memoir no one might ever read. The blinking red lights keep me company, strobing across the dashboard like a warning that never ends. The bell—its hollow chime cutting through the night, slow and steady, like a clock that only measures dread.

The white car with the skeleton graffiti.
Five hundred fifty-seven.

Sometimes I wonder—if I break the loop, could I go back? Back home, to laughter, to the sweet and savory warmth of the kitchen. Or would it still be what I saw last time—rot and mold, and a silence broken only by water dripping through the roof and the buzzing of flies?

The line of cargo draped in orange tarps.
Four hundred ninety-one.

The train roars on, endless as always. I tell myself this is the last time I’ll wait. The last time I’ll watch that gap open and close without me in it.

When I’m done, I’ll finish this post and send it. Watch the loading icon circle endlessly. While it does, I’ll wrap my phone in a sock, shove it into one of my shoes, and throw it over—across the tracks, to the other side of the train. If there’s still something out there, maybe my bottle will find a shore and deliver its message.

The giant rolls of sheet metal.
Four hundred twenty-four.

I know now that no one can save me. Even if they tried, it wouldn’t matter. I’m the only one who can do this—the only one who can make that decision.

Three hundred eighty-seven.

If this goes through, I want to leave this final note to my family.

Mom, I’m sorry—for all the restless nights, for every time you waited by the phone hoping I’d call, for every time I didn’t. You’ve always tried your best, more than anyone could ask for, and I didn’t. I could have been better. I could have worked on myself, but I didn’t. I let the weight of everything pull me under, and you didn’t deserve to pay the price for that. None of this was your fault. Not once. You loved me through every failure, and I wish I had loved myself enough to make that mean something.

Two hundred seventy-one.

Sarah, I’m sorry I never was the big brother you deserved—the big brother you needed. Every time you came to me for support, or just a shoulder to cry on, I turned it around and made myself the fragile one. I should never have done that. I should have been stronger, more mature, someone you could lean on instead of the other way around. But looking back now, I see the truth—I used you as a crutch to help me walk. And I regret it more than I can say.

Two hundred twelve.

And Dad… even though you’re gone, I hope you’re still watching. You raised a fighter, and I tried to live up to that, even when it didn’t look like it. Every time life knocked me flat, I heard your voice telling me to get back up, to never stay down, and somehow I always did. Maybe I didn’t win every fight, maybe I lost more than I care to admit—but I never quit. And I won’t now. Whatever’s on the other side of this… I’m going to face it head-on. I’ll keep moving forward, keep fighting through, no matter the cost.

One hundred twenty-two.

And to you, Mark. We never really talked much, and I never got to know you the way I should have. But from what I’ve seen, you’re a good man. Stay that way. Keep taking care of Sarah—she deserves someone solid in her corner. And hey… thanks for putting up with me.

Ninety-four.

If I don’t make it, I hope this train jumps the tracks when it hits me. I hope it rips itself apart and finally stops for good. Let the rails twist and shatter, let the whole damn machine collapse as it pulverizes me into paste. Because if I can’t get out, maybe at least I can stop it—so no one else ever has to ride this hell.

I gotta go now. The gap’s coming. Wish me luck.",2,1752836612.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1m2zax9,https://coff.ee/ydc_comics,YDC Call To Arms…🚨 Mission Briefing: Agent 404 to Earth Citizens 🚨,"**Hello, Earth Citizen.**

I’m Agent 404 (aka Bob), elite operative of Qwakkar — a hyper-advanced post-bureaucratic civilization.

I was deployed to Earth to assess its bureaucratic contamination levels. Unfortunately, I was deployed too early from my hiding place in a warehouse as a plush toy — all because a clerk added an extra digit to my barcode. I was meant to arrive in a few years. Instead, I’ve awakened… with no way to return to hibernation.

My human avatar — Jelly, a comic artist and single mom in the Philippines — has agreed to assist me in my mission. But she’s stuck in red tape just trying to launch her Etsy shop to fund our resistance.

🧱 **The Red Tape Problem**

Etsy, the intergalactic commerce gateway, now demands a $20 shop setup fee for creators in many countries outside the U.S. That $20 may not sound like much… but when you’re already $100 short per month, it might as well be $2,000.

This delay is keeping Jelly from launching The Red Tape Chronicles — a satirical comic series that fights back against the bureaucracy with duck-fueled absurdity.

# 🚫 Why We’re Not Using Substack for Payments

**Substack only allows one payment option for creators: Stripe.**

And Stripe is **not available in most countries**, including where Jelly lives. That means:

* No way to accept payments
* No paid subscriptions
* No monetization at all for most international creators

In short:

>

It’s an exclusionary system disguised as a publishing tool — one that **automatically locks out talented voices from across the world.**

So while we're using Substack **for exposure and community**, we’re forced to **use alternative support channels** just to get this project off the ground.

🦆 The Bigger Picture

This isn’t just about one artist.

It feels like a coordinated attack against the planet Qwakkar itself — an effort by Earth’s bureaucratic overlords to suppress the truth, creativity, and free expression.

Jelly receives no family support (they still don’t believe “art” is a job) and is raising a 10-month-old baby on her own. This is not an excuse — just reality.

We’re not asking for charity or pity. We’re offering value, creativity, and a satirical resistance movement you can be part of.

💥 How You Can Help

We’re asking as little as $1 from allies across the multiverse to breach this ridiculous red tape barrier and help bring The Red Tape Chronicles™ to life.

# You’re Not Broke-You're Just Trading Time for Tiny Rewards

There’s a moment that hits hard at 11:42 AM on a Tuesday.

You’ve finished scrolling through finance TikTok, your Slack is still pinging, and you’re looking at your bank balance thinking: *“There’s gotta be a smarter way to make money than sitting in endless Zooms and waiting for payday.”*

**Forex day trading**.

It’s fast, technical, and-when done right-can be a real path to consistent income. But it’s also loaded with noise, scams, and setups that’ll drain your account faster than you can say “EUR/USD.” This guide isn’t about overnight riches. It’s about building a disciplined, skill-based approach to day trading forex in 2025-one that’s mobile, modern, and actually makes sense for your life.

# Forex Day Trading Fundamentals for 2025

**What is forex day trading and how does it work?**

Forex day trading is buying and selling currencies within the same day, with the goal of cashing in on small price swings.

Think of it like this: Instead of betting long-term on where the dollar is headed, you're riding short-term waves-maybe catching a GBP/USD move over 30 minutes, then exiting before lunch. Trades are typically open for minutes to hours, never overnight (you don’t want to get blindsided by after-hours surprises).

Here’s how it works, practically:

* You pick a currency pair (say, EUR/USD).
* You analyze where it's likely to move next-based on charts, indicators, or macro news.
* You enter a position (buy or sell), and exit with a small profit (or loss).
* You rinse and repeat-ideally with a clear system and tight risk rules.

In 2025, fast execution and real-time data are non-negotiable. If your platform lags or your setup is based on 2020 YouTube advice, you're playing with fire.

*Forex day trading is not guessing. It’s systemized short-term speculation. Discipline > prediction.*

**Key forex market hours and the best times to day trade**

The forex market never sleeps-but that doesn’t mean you should trade around the clock.

The most active and profitable windows are when major financial centers overlap:

* London–New York overlap (8 AM–12 PM EST): Highest volatility and volume.
* Tokyo–London overlap (3 AM–4 AM EST): Lower volume but potential setups if you're early-birding.

Why does this matter? Because liquidity = faster execution and tighter spreads. And when you're scalping 10-pip moves, wide spreads can kill your edge.

If you're in Asia or Australia, the London session typically opens in your late afternoon-prime time for smart trades before dinner.

Personal note: I once tried trading during the Sydney-only session. Crickets. No volume. I literally watched a 4-pip candle form over 10 minutes and realized I was just... wasting time.

**How spreads and liquidity affect short-term trades**

Spreads-the difference between the bid and ask price-can be your hidden enemy.

In fast day trading, a 1-pip spread on a pair like EUR/USD is fine, but a 5-pip spread on a minor pair (like NZD/CAD) can instantly put you at a loss before you blink. It’s like starting a race with a 20-foot handicap.

High liquidity pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY) tend to have the tightest spreads and fastest order fills-ideal for day trading. Low liquidity pairs? More slippage, more headaches.

Always check your broker’s real-time spreads during your trading window. Some ""low spread"" brokers advertise tight numbers but widen them during news or low-volume times.

From *“Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets” by John J. Murphy*, Chapter 4: “Liquidity allows for freedom of action. In a thin market, even the most accurate chart pattern may fail because the market cannot absorb the order flow.”

**Why leverage matters more in day trading than swing trading**

Day trading is a high-frequency game. Your wins are smaller, but you take more of them-so leverage amplifies both your potential gains and risks.

In 2025, most regulated brokers offer 30:1 leverage for major pairs in Europe and Australia, and up to 50:1 in the U.S. (if you're not under prop firm rules). That means a $1,000 account can control up to $30,000 in currency-powerful, but also dangerous.

Unlike swing traders, you don't have time to “wait it out” if the market goes against you. A 1% move against your position with 30:1 leverage? That's -30% on your capital. Gone.

Smart day traders:

* Use leverage selectively
* Keep stop losses ultra-tight
* Never risk more than 1–2% per trade

From *“Trading in the Zone” by Mark Douglas*, Chapter 3: “The market doesn’t know you exist. You can’t control it-but you can control your position size and your risk.”

# Best Forex Day Trading Strategies That Work Today

**Scalping vs. Momentum Trading: Which Suits Your Style?**

If forex day trading were a sport, scalping is speed chess, and momentum trading is blitz-fast, reactive, and based on pattern recognition.

Scalping means you’re taking 5–10 pip wins, sometimes in under two minutes. You're in and out before the market has time to change its mind. It's surgical. You're watching every tick.

Momentum trading, on the other hand, rides fast-moving trends. Think: big news drops or technical breakouts. You enter *after* confirmation and aim to hold for 20–50 pips, maybe longer if the move’s strong.

Which fits you depends on:

* Your attention span (be honest)
* Your internet speed + platform latency
* How many trades you want to take in a day (scalpers do 10+, momentum traders 2–4)

Test both in demo accounts. You’ll find your rhythm quicker when you stop forcing a style that doesn’t fit your brain.

From *“The Disciplined Trader” by Mark Douglas*, Chapter 7: “Successful traders align their methods with their personality. Otherwise, the strategy becomes a stress test, not a system.”

**High-Probability Breakout Setups for Day Traders**

Breakouts are where most beginner traders either *print money*\-or get absolutely wrecked.

A breakout setup means you’re entering when price breaks above resistance or below support, often on high volume. But here's the kicker: false breakouts are everywhere.

To trade breakouts smartly:

* Wait for the *retest*. That means: price breaks a level → comes back to test it → *then* enters.
* Use volume confirmation or the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to check momentum.
* Trade high-volatility news windows (like NFP or CPI drops) when breakouts are more real.

Example: EUR/USD spikes through a 1.1000 resistance at 8:30 AM EST (news hour). You wait for it to dip back to 1.1000, it holds, and you go long. That's the structure. Not FOMO.

From *“Naked Forex” by Alex Nekritin & Walter Peters*, Chapter 5: “Breakouts only work if traders *believe* in the level. Without participation, the move collapses.”

**Using Support, Resistance, and Fibonacci Intraday**

You don’t need to plaster your screen with 12 indicators.

In fact, the cleanest charts usually win. Support and resistance-horizontal zones where price has reversed before-are *still* your best friends in 2025. Add Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to spot areas where price might pull back *and bounce hard*.

How it plays out:

* Identify support/resistance zones from higher timeframes (H1 or H4).
* Drop down to 5-minute or 15-minute charts to trade inside those zones.
* Use Fib levels to set entries, stops, or partial exits.

Bonus combo: Wait for price to bounce at both a Fib level + support zone + bullish engulfing candle? That’s your green light.

From *“Forex Price Action Scalping” by Bob Volman*, Chapter 3: “Support and resistance zones must be seen as battlefields. The smart trader waits for signs of who’s winning.”

**How to Build a Repeatable Entry/Exit Ruleset**

Day trading without rules is like trying to drive a Tesla on manual steering-chaotic and dangerous.

Here’s a simple ruleset framework that 90% of profitable traders adapt in some form:

1. Trigger condition (e.g., bullish pin bar at key support)
2. Entry confirmation (e.g., RSI divergence or volume spike)
3. Stop-loss placement (e.g., just beyond recent low)
4. Take-profit logic (e.g., 1.5R or next resistance)

Once you find something that works-even in a small sample size-lock it in and journal it. Consistency turns random trades into a system.

Real talk: The more discretionary your strategy is, the more emotional it becomes. Your brain will lie to you mid-trade. Your rules won't.

From *“How to Day Trade for a Living” by Andrew Aziz*, Chapter 4: “Great traders don’t just find good setups-they execute them the same way, every time.”

# Tools, Charts, and Platforms for Day Trading Success

**Top Forex Day Trading Platforms with Low Latency**

If your broker's platform lags during high volatility, you’re toast.

In 2025, the forex platforms most trusted by serious day traders aren’t the flashy, ad-heavy ones-they’re the ones that fill your orders fast, never freeze, and don’t play games with spreads.

Here’s what matters most:

* Low latency execution: You want trades filled within milliseconds-not “spinning wheel” purgatory.
* Tight, real-time spreads: Especially during news. Watch for widening spreads before NFP.
* No hidden commissions: Transparent pricing wins. Every pip matters in day trading.

Top platforms in 2025 (based on execution speed, user feedback, and regulation):

* cTrader (via IC Markets or Pepperstone): Fast AF and ultra-transparent. Built for scalpers.
* MetaTrader 5 (MT5): Still king in terms of tools and broker support. Light, flexible, and global.
* TradingView (broker integration): Great for charting + execution combo, especially with OANDA or Forex.com.

Avoid offshore “no-name” brokers offering 1000:1 leverage and zero commissions. If it sounds too good, it usually means they’re the market maker betting against you.

From *“The Art of Currency Trading” by Brent Donnelly*, Chapter 2: “Execution quality is a trader’s oxygen. If you can’t breathe in and out of trades quickly, you’ll suffocate during volatility.”

**Must-Have Charting Tools and Indicators for Intraday Moves**

The right charting setup isn’t about loading 19 indicators. It’s about clarity. You should be able to glance and *know what’s happening*.

Here’s a clean 2025-ready stack most day traders swear by:

* Volume-weighted average price (VWAP): Tracks the true average price of the day. Crucial for spotting where smart money trades.
* 20 and 50 EMA (exponential moving averages): Quick visual of short-term momentum and crossover entries.
* Relative Strength Index (RSI): Classic, but gold. Look for divergence setups on the 5-minute chart.
* ADR (Average Daily Range): Tells you if a move is stretched or has room left. No more chasing already-run candles.

And yes, price action still matters more than indicators. Tools are supported, not a crutch.

My chart setup: Dark background, no gridlines, VWAP + EMAs, RSI tucked below. Clean, mobile-friendly, and fast on the eyes during long sessions.

From *“Technical Analysis Explained” by Martin Pring*, Chapter 6: “Indicators should confirm what price is telling you-not the other way around. Too much clutter blinds the trader.”

**Pros and Cons of Automated Forex Trading Bots**

Automation sounds sexy-“Let the bot trade while you sleep!”-but the reality? Most retail bots lose money, especially in fast, choppy markets.

**Pros:**

* Bots don’t feel fear or greed.
* Great for backtesting and rule-based systems.
* Work 24/5, ideal if you can’t stare at charts all day.

**Cons:**

* Market conditions shift. Bots don’t adapt unless coded to.
* Many EAs (expert advisors) are built on outdated logic.
* Zero emotional control = blowing up accounts if risk isn’t capped.

If you go the bot route:

* Use regulated brokers that allow EAs
* Backtest on multiple years of data
* Start on demo, then micro-lot live

And know this: No bot replaces human judgment. The best bots are co-pilots, not autopilots.

From *“Flash Boys” by Michael Lewis*, Chapter 9: “Speed is power-but in trading, speed without context is chaos.”

**Mobile Trading Apps for Fast Execution on the Go**

Let’s be real-you’re not always at your desk. Maybe you’re commuting, mid-coffee run, or just vibing at a friend’s house when the perfect setup hits. Mobile trading in 2025 is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.

Top-rated forex mobile apps that don’t suck:

* cTrader Mobile: Surprisingly smooth, with almost desktop-level functionality.
* MetaTrader 5 (MT5) app: Lightweight, widely used, tons of indicators.
* TradingView Mobile: A+ for charting, but needs a broker link to execute.
* FOREX.com: Great for U.S. traders, tight spreads + good UX.

Tips for mobile day trading:

* Use limit orders or preset stop-loss/take-profit-don’t market order on a shaky signal.
* Only trade familiar pairs and setups you’ve tested. Mobile is not for experimenting.

Set push alerts for price zones you care about. You get notified when your setup triggers, not distracted every time EUR/USD wiggles 3 pips.

From *“Reminiscences of a Stock Operator” by Edwin Lefèvre*, Chapter 8: “The market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight.”

# Real Risk Management for Forex Day Traders

**How much capital should you risk per trade?**

Here’s the fastest way to stay in the game: risk 1% or less of your account per trade. Full stop.

If you’re trading with $5,000, that means your maximum loss on any single trade should be $50. Not $150. Not $500. Just $50.

Why? Because string together a few losers (which *will* happen), and you’re still alive to fight another day. Most new traders lose because they don’t size down-they size up, chasing wins.

Here’s a formula that works:

nginx

CopyEdit

Risk per trade = (Account balance) x (Risk %)  

Example: $5,000 x 0.01 = $50 max loss

Hot tip: Focus more on position size than “how many pips you want.” A 20-pip stop can still be safe if you size your lot correctly.

From *“Risk Management and Financial Institutions” by John C. Hull*, Chapter 10: “Even the best strategies fail without capital discipline. It’s not about being right-it’s about staying solvent.”

**Setting stop-loss and take-profit ratios that preserve capital**

Want to feel like a professional trader instead of a gambler? Lock in this mindset:

* Every trade must have a defined stop-loss
* Every trade must have a logical take-profit

This is your risk/reward ratio in action. The gold standard? At least 1:1.5 or 1:2. That means for every $1 you risk, you aim to make $1.50 or $2.

Why it works:

* Even with a 50% win rate, you’re still profitable.
* You’re no longer chasing. You’re executing a math-backed edge.

Example:

* You risk 20 pips to make 40.
* Hit 5 wins and 5 losses? You’re still up.

Without this structure, one trade can wipe out five good ones. That’s how accounts bleed slowly, unnoticed.

From *“The New Trading for a Living” by Dr. Alexander Elder*, Chapter 6: “The goal is not to avoid losses. It’s to ensure no single loss takes you out of the game.”

**The danger of overleveraging in day trading**

Here’s the raw truth: leverage looks like freedom, but acts like a loaded weapon.

Most brokers in 2025 offer 30:1 or 50:1 leverage. That means your $1,000 can control $30,000 to $50,000 in currency. It sounds powerful, but if the market moves against you by just 0.5%, you're staring at a 15%–25% drawdown.

Day traders fall into this trap *all the time*:

* They hit a hot streak
* They double down with bigger trades
* One bad move hits, and boom-30% of the account gone

Here’s how to stay safe:

* Use leverage as a tool, not a lifeline
* Calculate your lot size based on your stop-loss, not on your dreams
* Walk away if you’re tempted to “go big or go home”

From *“Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk” by Peter L. Bernstein*, Chapter 14: “Risk is not inherently bad. What’s dangerous is misunderstanding it.”

**What to do after a losing streak: Resetting without revenge trading**

This might be the most important lesson in this entire guide.

Losing streaks happen to everyone-yes, even traders with 6-figure months and solid systems. What separates pros from spiraling newbies is how they respond.

Here’s a 3-step reset plan when you’re in a drawdown:

1. Step back for 24 hours. Don’t even open charts. Emotion = noise.
2. Journal the last 5 trades. Were they by the rules? Or were you guessing?
3. Switch to demo or micro-lots for 3–5 trades. Rebuild confidence with precision, not size.

This *resets your nervous system* and reminds you that your job isn’t to make money every day-it’s to follow your edge consistently.

Personal note: After a three-day spiral in 2023, I made a rule: No live trades until I string together 3 clean, rule-following demo entries. It changed everything.

From *“The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel*, Chapter 11: “Controlling your behavior is more powerful than being smart.”

# Trader Psychology and Performance Under Pressure

**How to avoid FOMO and overtrading in volatile markets**

FOMO is the silent killer of forex accounts.

It shows up like this:

* You miss a clean EUR/USD move.
* Now you're itching to “make it back” or “catch the next one.”
* So you enter late. Or worse-randomly.
* One loss leads to another. Then you’re rage-clicking.

Here’s the antidote: accept that the market will move without you-and that’s okay.

 Tactical ways to kill FOMO:

* Use alerts at key levels instead of staring at charts all day.
* Pre-define your setups. If it doesn’t meet your rules, it’s not your trade.
* Have a daily trade limit (e.g., 3 setups max). Once you hit it, you're done.

Mantra: *Missing a trade is better than forcing one. There will always be another setup. Always.*

From *“The Daily Trading Coach” by Brett Steenbarger*, Chapter 1: “Emotional reactivity is the single biggest drain on a trader’s edge. Consistency begins with self-awareness.”

**Creating a daily trading routine for mental clarity**

Day trading is like being an athlete. You don’t just show up and sprint. You warm up, prep, and focus.

Here’s a routine that works-even if you’ve got a 9–5 or other responsibilities:

1. Pre-market scan (20 mins): Mark major support/resistance, news events, and pairs to watch.
2. Trading window (1–2 hours max): Trade during your peak mental energy. No “just in case” setups.
3. Post-trade review (15 mins): Journal every entry, exit, emotion. What felt off? What worked?

It’s not about being robotic. It’s about protecting your brain from burnout and overthinking.

Real talk: Trading all day doesn’t mean you’re grinding. It usually means you’re guessing.

From *“Atomic Habits” by James Clear*, Chapter 5: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”

**The role of journaling in day trading improvement**

You won’t remember why you took that trade in three days. But your journal will.

Every elite trader keeps some kind of journal or log. Not just for numbers, but for *patterns*. Emotional, technical, and time-based.

What to track:

* Date/time, pair, strategy used
* Entry + exit price, stop-loss, take-profit
* Screenshot of chart + written reason for trade
* How you felt before, during, after

Within a month, you’ll start seeing repeat mistakes or hidden strengths.

Example: You notice your London session trades are 70% accurate, but the New York session is chaotic. That's the edge. That’s real.

And no-this doesn’t need to be a giant spreadsheet. Even a Google Doc or Notion template works. The goal is clarity, not perfection.

From *“One Good Trade” by Mike Bellafiore*, Chapter 9: “Your journal is your mirror. It shows you what you refuse to see in real time.”

# Taxation and Compliance for Active Forex Traders

**How forex day trading profits are taxed in major countries**

This part can get murky fast, so let’s break it down.

Your trading profits are income. Governments want their slice. But *how* they tax you depends on where you live and how your trades are classified.

**United States:**

* Forex falls under IRC Section 988 (default) = taxed as ordinary income.
* Max tax rate? Whatever your income bracket is (up to \~37%).
* But-you can elect Section 1256 treatment (for certain contracts), which gives a blended 60/40 tax rate:
   * 60% long-term capital gains
   * 40% short-term

**United Kingdom:**

* Spread betting = tax-free (if you’re not doing it professionally).
* But if you’re day trading via CFDs or forex accounts? Profits fall under capital gains tax (currently 10–20%).

**Australia:**

* Forex gains are considered income and taxed at marginal rates.
* No capital gains discounts unless holding for 12+ months (which day traders don’t).

Canada, Germany, India? It gets trickier-most treat it as business income if you’re trading actively. You may need to register as self-employed or declare it as speculative profit.

Talk to a tax pro in your country. Don’t wing it. Don’t wait until April.

From *“Tax Guide for Traders” by Robert Green, CPA*, Chapter 3: “Traders often pay more in taxes than they realize-not because of the rates, but because of misclassification.”

**What records to keep for tax reporting as a day trader**

If you’ve ever stared at your trade history from a broker and felt your soul leave your body... you’re not alone.

But here’s what you *actually* need to stay on top of taxes:

* Monthly P&L statements (most brokers export this)
* Trade log with dates, instrument, entry/exit, profit/loss
* Screenshots or notes for unusual trades (e.g., news spikes or platform outages)
* Brokerage fee records (commissions, spreads, rollover fees)

Bonus tip: Use tools like TraderVue, Edgewonk, or a custom Excel template to organize this. And back it up. Tax audits don’t care if your hard drive crashed.

You don’t need perfect records-you need *consistent ones*.

From *“Profit First” by Mike Michalowicz*, Chapter 6: “Money loves clarity. When your finances are murky, so is your decision-making.”

**Legal leverage limits and compliance per region (2025 update)**

Gone are the Wild West days of 500:1 leverage with shady brokers. Regulators across the globe have cracked down-for good reason.

Here’s what’s legal and current (2025 edition):

* **U.S. (NFA/CFTC regulated):**
   * 50:1 max on major pairs
   * 20:1 on minors
   * No hedging allowed on same account
* **UK and EU (FCA, ESMA rules)**:
   * 30:1 on majors
   * 20:1 on minors
   * Negative balance protection required
* **Australia (ASIC rules)**:
   * Same as EU: 30:1 max
   * Higher leverage only through whitelisted pro trader status
* **Offshore brokers** (like in Seychelles, Bahamas, etc.):
   * Offer up to 500:1 or more
   * BUT: Often unregulated or lightly regulated
   * No legal recourse if they ghost you

Bottom line: Leverage is like caffeine. A little boosts performance. Too much gives you heart palpitations and poor decisions.

From *“Unshakeable” by Tony Robbins*, Chapter 4: “The biggest risk isn’t volatility. It’s betting big without knowing the rules.”

# FAQ

# What’s the minimum capital to start forex day trading effectively?

Technically, some brokers let you start with $100. Realistically? You need at least $500–$1,000 to make it meaningful and manageable.

Why? Because with 1% risk per trade, a $100 account means risking $1 per trade. That’s... not much breathing room. Every tiny move feels like a crisis.

But with $1,000:

* You can risk $10 per trade
* You get to practice risk management *properly*
* You’re less likely to “YOLO” trades out of boredom

Small accounts are fine to learn-but if you want to build consistency and feel like a real trader, you need enough capital to follow your rules without panic.

From *“Money: Master the Game” by Tony Robbins*, Chapter 7: “You can’t build wealth with nickels and fear. You need a system-and room to let it work.”

# Can beginners be successful in forex day trading?

Yes-but not without patience, practice, and structure. This is *not* the game for fast money seekers or crypto bros chasing dopamine spikes.

Most beginners lose because:

* They trade live too soon
* They skip journaling
* They chase trades with no system

But if you:

* Use a demo account for 1–3 months
* Learn one or two simple setups
* Focus more on risk than profit…

…you can absolutely build skill. There’s no gatekeeping here. Just a brutal learning curve that rewards the obsessed.

Real advice: Don’t treat forex like a lottery. Treat it like a sport. Show up every day to train, not win.

From *“The Little Book of Trading” by Michael Covel*, Chapter 1: “The barrier to success isn’t knowledge-it’s emotional control and relentless repetition.”

# Which time frame is best for fast-paced trading?

For day traders, the sweet spot is usually the 5-minute or 15-minute chart. Here’s why:

* 5-minute: Great for scalping or catching early momentum
* 15-minute: Better for structure, cleaner breakouts
* 1-minute: Way too noisy unless you’re a hyper-fast scalper (read: not ideal for beginners)

That said, always mark key levels from the 1-hour or 4-hour chart first. Higher time frames give context. Lower time frames give entries.

Think of it like Google Maps: You zoom out to plan the route, then zoom in to make turns.

From *“Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes” by Brian Shannon*, Chapter 2: “Timeframe alignment is the difference between a sniper shot and a wild swing.”

# Are demo accounts useful for testing day trading strategies?

100% yes-but only if you treat them like real money.

**Demo accounts:**

* Let you test strategies without risking cash
* Help you get comfortable with your platform
* Show whether your rules actually work *before* you go live

But here’s the trap: Most people use demos with no emotional discipline. They overtrade, risk 20% per trade, and then wonder why they bomb when they switch to real money.

**To get real value from a demo:**

* Trade with the same size you’ll use live
* Use real stop-loss and take-profit levels
* Stick to a daily trade limit

If you can follow your system in demo mode for 30+ trades without breaking your rules? You’re probably ready to go small live.

As someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen, both for meal prep and reheating leftovers, I found its stainless steel and brushed chrome finish incredibly appealing. It’s compact enough to fit on a countertop without dominating the space, yet spacious inside with 1 cubic foot of cooking area. At first glance, it seemed like the perfect combination of style and practicality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This microwave feels solid the moment you unbox it. The stainless steel interior is a standout feature—it resists absorbing food odors and is incredibly easy to clean. Having a toddler in the house means constant spills, and the wipe-clean interior has been a game-changer for me. Plus, the chrome accents on the door handle and control panel give it a premium appearance. The dimensions, roughly 20.5 inches wide and 12.8 inches high, allow it to fit comfortably on most countertops without feeling bulky. While it looks sophisticated, it’s not so futuristic that you’re unsure how to use it.

**Functionality and Performance**  
Testing the microwave revealed just how versatile it is. With 25 preprogrammed settings, I found myself exploring one-touch options like reheating coffee, defrosting steaks, and even cooking frozen vegetables. The 1000-watt power ensures food heats uniformly, a problem I’ve run into with less powerful models. The 10 power levels let you customize the intensity, making it ideal for various types of meals. I tried everything from warming butter to cooking a baked potato, and each task was executed flawlessly. Additionally, the rotating 12-inch glass turntable ensures even heating, which was evident when reheating Friday night pizza.

**Two-Stage Cooking and Defrost Functions**  
One feature I didn’t realize I needed until now is the two-stage cooking option. It efficiently switches between defrosting and cooking without requiring you to reset the settings. For example, I defrosted some chicken breasts by weight and then had the microwave transition seamlessly into cooking them—it’s incredibly useful for meal prepping on hectic weekdays. The time-defrost function is also surprisingly precise, avoiding the issue of overcooked edges that happens with poorly designed microwaves.

**User Experience and Controls**  
Interacting with this microwave is simple, thanks to the touchpad controls and LCD screen. The interface is intuitive, even for someone less tech-savvy like my dad, who used it over the holidays without needing a tutorial. The presets are labeled with clear icons, and the response speed of the touchpad is quick. However, the screen isn't backlit, making it slightly hard to read under dim lighting.

**Pluses**  
- Stainless steel interior resists odors and cleans easily.  
- Compact size with generous internal capacity.  
- Two-stage cooking simplifies complex meals.  

**Critiques**  
- The LCD screen could have been backlit for better visibility.  
- It’s a bit pricier than basic models without offering Bluetooth connectivity or app-controlled features, which some might expect at this price range.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to competitors like Panasonic and Toshiba, the Cuisinart CMW-100 holds up well. For instance, the stainless steel interior is a hygienic upgrade over the standard ceramic-coated options offered by many brands. That said, Panasonic models often come with Smart Inverter technology, which provides more precise cooking control but also increases the cost. Toshiba has options equipped with better presets for grilling or air frying, though those are bulkier and not as visually striking. I’d say the Cuisinart excels in style and ease of cleaning but slightly lags behind in offering cutting-edge features.

**Cost Efficiency**  
While this microwave is not the cheapest option out there, its premium-look finish and functionality justify the investment for someone like me who uses it every day. I think it offers reliable cost-efficiency because the durability of the stainless steel interior means it’s built to last. It’s an excellent value proposition if you’re tired of microwaves that seem to fall apart after a couple of years.

[A sample of antimony is displayed at the Natural History Museum in London, Britain, June 6, 2025. REUTERS\/Isabel Infantes\/File Photo](https://preview.redd.it/zxlhlaodwldf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef1c863141f64ee93cb04c83dc7173cc77899dbb)

BEIJING, July 18 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of State Security on Friday said foreign spy agencies had tried to ""steal"" rare earths and pledged to crack down on infiltration and espionage targeted at its critical mineral sector. Foreign intelligence agencies and their agents had colluded with ""domestic lawbreakers"" to steal rare earth-related items from China, posing a serious threat to China's national security, the spy agency said in a statement on its WeChat account without naming any specific country.

The ministry said it had detected attempts by an unnamed country to bypass export restrictions by forging labels, falsifying cargo manifests and transshipping cargoes, where products are routed through third countries before going to their final destination. Reuters reported exclusively this month that unusually large quantities of antimony - a metal used in batteries, chips and flame retardants - appeared to have been [transshipped into the United States](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-us-buyers-critical-minerals-bypass-chinas-export-ban-2025-07-09/) via Thailand and Mexico after China banned U.S. exports. China added several rare earths and related magnets to its [export restriction list](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) in early April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.

The decision rattled global supply chains key to electric vehicles, robots and defence, forcing some automakers outside China to partially suspend production due to shortages.However, China's rare earths exports rose 32% in June from the month before in a potential sign that [agreements reached last month](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-deal-related-trade-was-signed-with-china-wednesday-2025-06-26/) between Washington and Beijing to free up the flow of the metals are bearing fruit .Nvidia's [(NVDA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O) planned resumption of sales of its H20 AI [chips](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-resume-h20-gpu-sales-china-2025-07-15/) to China was part of the rare earth negotiations.

Mineral processing optimisation underway to unlock rare earth potential; long-lead equipment ordered for demonstration plant.

American Rare Earths (ASX: ARR) **is progressing its Halleck Creek Rare Earths Project in Wyoming, USA, with mineral processing optimisation and preparations for a demonstration plant.** American Rare Earths is a critical minerals company focused on reshaping the U.S. rare earths industry. Through its subsidiary Wyoming Rare (USA) Inc., the company is advancing the Halleck Creek Project in Wyoming—a world-class rare earth deposit with the potential to secure America’s critical mineral independence for generations.

The company has commenced mineral processing optimisation tests at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek project, with the goal of increasing magnet rare earth recoveries. These tests will run parallel to existing mineral processing tests, exploring various milling methods and optimising mineral separation and concentration. Test mining is set to begin immediately at the Cowboy State Mine to provide bulk samples for the optimisation work and feedstock for the demonstration plant.

To further advance the project, American Rare Earths has ordered long-lead time equipment for the demonstration plant, including conventional magnetic separation equipment. The demonstration plant will showcase and fine-tune the rare earth production process at a larger scale. The company intends to use the mineral processing flow-sheet developed from the optimisation work as a blueprint for the plant, as well as future technical studies.

# JULY 17th, 2025~Legislators Embrace Technology Recycling to Compete With China

[Legislators Embrace Technology Recycling to Compete With China - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/legislators-embrace-technology-recycling-to-compete-with-china-2b0b3b00)

[A refinery in southwest Germany extracts metals from electronic and industrial waste. Photo: patrick hertzog\/AFP\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/2b5wyhzu2mdf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=2717dd04fcee26c8e9c9a8434b235bc8342f316c)

The digital detritus of discarded laptops, phones and other electronics contain much-sought-after resources hidden in plain sight.

Lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday pushed for improved recycling infrastructure to secure critical minerals, such as lithium, that power electric vehicles and smartphones. The [race is on to secure ](https://www.wsj.com/business/us-rare-earth-producer-texas-58796240?mod=article_inline)critical minerals in the U.S., in part to offset China’s dominance in the ownership and processing of these materials. The U.S. is also lagging behind China on renewable energy [and electric vehicles](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trumps-megabill-gives-chinese-ev-makers-a-leg-up-says-head-of-auto-group-8d12948d?mod=article_inline), driven in part by critical minerals.

“E-waste is a commodity that can be repurposed in our fight to not only be energy independent, but energy dominant,” said Gary Palmer (R., Ala), who led the hearing as chair of the house committee on energy and commerce, advocating for the U.S. to “use recycling as a tool to compete with China and to protect our communities.”

Brett Guthrie (R., Ky) echoed his assertion, advocating for the recovery of “valuable materials such as critical minerals from items that are discarded everyday.”

[Electronics recycling](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/your-junk-is-needed-for-the-new-electric-era-504a7e8f?mod=article_inline) is complicated, especially with the medley of metals, glass and plastic that make up the devices. And electronic waste will expand courtesy of the data center boom fueling artificial intelligence, which uses graphic processing units and servers that only last for a few years.

Raul Ruiz (D., Calif), who represents the resource-rich Imperial Valley region known as “Lithium Valley” near the Mexican border, focused on the importance of a critical-minerals strategy. He pushed for “critical mineral recovery and recycling to build a sustainable supply chain,” citing energy dependence and national security. Lithium is used for electric vehicles and battery storage.

At the hearing, legislators questioned Matt Bedingfield, executive vice president of commercial strategy and growth at Mint Innovation, a company which recovers metals such as gold, copper and silver from old laptops, phones and other electronics. Mint has a plant in Sydney, Australia, but is poised to expand to Texas.

“We can only import these metals once by recycling them and then using them in our industry here too,” he said.  

Some 62 million metric tons of electronic waste was collected in 2022, according to a report from the United Nations.

[A vial of rare earth material extracted from electronic waste in Orleans, central France. Photo: christophe archambault\/Agence France-Presse\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/gsvrk0tz2mdf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=78eb26dfef04ca5314ba76d94e189aff89014b4c)

There are environmental considerations also. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R., Iowa) highlighted that minerals from electronic waste can leach into the ground when piling up in landfills. In March, she reintroduced the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act, which would task the Environmental Protection Agency with setting up a program to boost recycling in communities that have at most one recovery facility within a 75-mile radius.

Miller-Meeks also pointed to competition with China. “We’re seeing China purchase our aluminum scrap above market prices, process it, and sell it back to us at a premium,” she said.

The hearing also focused on plastics recycling, with the United Nations set to meet in August in Geneva, Switzerland, to continue negotiating a plastics treaty. 

Since the 1950s, some 9.2 billion tons of plastic has been made, more than three quarters of which has ended up in [landfills, dumps](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beverage-and-snack-giants-defend-sustainable-packaging-plans-amid-investor-pressure-cc3a87df?mod=article_inline) and the ocean, according to the U.N. environment program’s website. Between 19 million and 23 million tons of plastic waste ends up in lakes, rivers and seas every year, it said.

tates from California to Minnesota recently enacted laws that require companies to contribute to recycling-infrastructure funding, a requirement known as extended producer responsibility, that puts the onus of where a product ends up on businesses. And [some shoppers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shoppers-are-slowly-turning-away-from-plastic-packaging-f106a737?mod=article_inline) are turning away from plastic packaging over sustainability concerns.

“We’re committed to ending plastic waste and advancing a circular economy for plastics, because frankly, we need plastics; modern life does rely on them,” said Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers at the American Chemistry Council, speaking at the hearing. He referenced packaging that extends the shelf life of food as well as medical equipment such as syringes, gloves and masks.

“Plastic is just not recycled enough, to fix that we have to modernize the way that we collect, reuse and recycle materials,” Eisenberg said.

“We have to upgrade a recycling system that was set up in the 1970s for bottles, cans and paper.”

There is a lot of work to be done, said Paul Tonko (D., NY), adding that better recycling labeling, accessibility and education is also essential to keep excess waste from clogging landfills.

“I understand the desire to promote innovation to overcome these challenges,” Tonko said. “But in reality, our recycling system needs some very basic foundational improvements before we can even begin to suggest that new technologies will save us.”

# JULY 17th, 2025~How China created a chokehold on the rare earths industry

[How China created a chokehold on the rare earths industry | Georgia Public Broadcasting](https://www.gpb.org/news/2025/07/17/how-china-created-chokehold-on-the-rare-earths-industry)

https://reddit.com/link/1m2z9i3/video/sfjx4bxsxldf1/player

Deep in an underground, World War Two-era vault, investment manager Louis O'Connor guards his firm's most valuable assets.

The treasure inside? Rare earth elements.

""Make no mistake about it, there's three and a half meter walls and doors and armed security,"" says O'Connor, the CEO of Strategic Metals Invest, a firm that lets individual investors buy into stockpiles of rare earths.

Many so-called rare earth elements are actually quite common, and they are mined globally, but China has a near-monopoly on [refining them](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf) for use in everyday electronics, like speakers, as well as for crucial defense systems, like fighter jets.

When China decided to substantially cut off exports of seven types of rare earths this spring, O'Connor says he felt the pinch immediately. One investor touring the company's vault at the time offered on the spot to buy O'Connor's entire inventory of terbium and dysprosium, two valuable ""heavy"" rare earth elements, he says.

The episode illustrated the power of China's dominance over the industry.

""They're installing what you might call a tap system, where they can turn that tap on and off,"" says O'Connor.

That supply chain chokehold has given China a powerful tool it has wielded in a trade war with the U.S. Within weeks of China requiring foreign companies to apply for a license to buy rare earths, several [American](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-ceo-china-rare-earth-shortage-car-production/) and [European](http://autonews.com/europe/ane-china-exports-tariffs-rare-earths-evs-0604/) companies said they were forced to shut down production lines. [Regaining access](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429236/why-rare-earth-elements-are-central-to-u-s-china-trade-talks) to Chinese rare earths was a central point of contention in US-China trade [negotiations](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/g-s1-71676/us-china-trade-talks-london) this spring.

But China did not always enjoy such dominance. Developing an export control regime they could minutely control took decades of sometimes painful trial and error.

# Spotting strategic value

During most of the 20th century, the U.S. was top dog in the rare earths industry, which was then-concentrated around [the Mountain Pass mine](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/23/949590270/the-strategic-value-of-rare-earths) in California.

China also recognized the strategic value of rare earths, and starting in the 1960s, Chinese executives came to visit Mountain Pass several times, says Mark Smith, a former CEO at Molycorp, a major rare earths processing company at the Mountain Pass mine.

""We toured them. We explained what we do, allowed them to take pictures and everything else. They took it back to China,"" says Smith.

Chinese refineries then improved on technology, and taking advantage of cheap electricity in China, hundreds of lucrative mining and processing firms in the country popped up to service mostly domestic demand for rare earths.

But the industry was highly unregulated and chaotic, as hundreds of small-scale, private mines and refineries competed against one another, undercutting each other's profits.

""They drive down the price against themselves,"" says Chris Ruffle, an investor who has worked in China for decades, including in the metals industry. ""They kill themselves.""

""China's rare earths aren't being sold at a 'rare' price but at an 'earth' price,"" [complained](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235016.shtml) Xiao Yaqing, a minister of industry and information technology.

# A dirty business

As Chinese producers sought an upper hand in rare earths, they also unleashed unrestrained mining that came at great cost to the country's natural resources.

In the early 2000s, Ruffles visited a private rare earths refinery in Jiangsu, a province in southern China. ""The thick smoke slightly gave it away,"" says Ruffles of the facilities. He described huge piles of tailings — toxic, metallic by-products from other industrial processes, sitting on the bare ground.

Destructive, small-scale mining was especially prevalent in southern China, where the most valuable, natural deposits of ""heavy"" rare earth elements are.

""They would mine the side of the hill with their acts and picks and shovels, and then they would dig a hole in the ground, no liners or anything like that at all. Then they poured five gallon buckets of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid….let that certain stew for a while,"" remember Smith, who frequently visited China during this period. ""When the storms come in, all that acid just washes out.""

The mining left China's terrain scarred with lasting groundwater and soil pollution. Local residents staged period protests against rare earth mining, but rare earth mining provided local governments with[ abundant revenue,](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-10-21/133523341196.shtml?from=wap) and they repeatedly ignored central government orders to close down dirty mines.

""The rare earth industry has the profits of \[selling\] heroin but without the risks… Rare earth is more addictive than drugs,"" [wrote](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20120418/116762.shtml) two Chinese state media reporters in a 2012 investigation into rare earths mining.

""There are generally two types of people who can deal with rare earths: the first is someone who has just been released from prison, and the other is someone who can get someone out of prison. Those who are not afraid of death and leading cadres are all involved,"" in the journalists wrote.

# Consolidation or bust

By the late 1990s, Beijing had had enough of the domestic price wars and local pollution. It started imposing production and export quotas to incentivize upstream processing of rare earths, cut down on pollution, and protect the industry from foreign intervention.

The quotas created two sets of prices, ""in effect, two tier pricing, when exports were limited to the rest of the world that resulted in lower rare earth prices for domestic Chinese consumers,"" says Rod Eggert, a professor of mineral economics at the Colorado School of Mines.

There was also a second, unintended consequence to the quotas: they creating a thriving smuggling industry. Up to a third of the country's rare earth products in the mid-2000s was illegal, smuggled out of China despite state controls, analysts estimate, because of demand from Japan and the U.S.

Then, American and European companies cried foul over the export quotas, and in 2014, the World Trade Organization [ruled](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-wins-victory-in-rare-earths-dispute-with-China) China could not use them.

But China was unfazed. It was already shifting tactics. It would seek global dominance in rare earths not through controlling the volume of outputs, but instead, by controlling which firms could operate.

# A ""secret war"" to consolidate

Authorities dubbed the campaign ""one plus five:"" an ambitious, and often ruthless, effort to winnow down the entire rare earth industry to just six consolidated companies. Authorities [called](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20120418/116762.shtml) the consolidation their ""secret war"" against illegal production.

Starting in 2011, provincial authorities [were instructed](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20110726/105784.shtml) to mount [unannounced audits](http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0806/c1001-22465601.html) of mines, [to seize](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-08/08/c_129214123.htm) contraband ore and byproducts, and when needed, [dynamiting](https://gdee.gd.gov.cn/shbtwj/content/post_2304355.html) and [smashing](https://www.chinanews.com/gn/news/2008/04-22/1227749.shtml) to pieces illegal mining operations.

""I saw firsthand how the private sector got squeezed out,"" says Ruffle, the investor.

Within four years, China declared victory. It announced the closure of dozens of smaller mining and refining companies and guided the mergers of surviving companies into six supersized, mostly- state-owned firms, nicknamed the Big Six in China.

Through the Big Six, China could now largely control both supply and price.

""Whereas before you had a lot more competition from different producers, now you get very homogeneous pricing,"" says Jan Giese, a Frankfurt-based rare earth trader. ""It's difficult to have competitive bids.""

# American upstarts

Unlike metal commodities like nickel or gold, there is no independent exchange for buying and selling rare earth elements.

Because Chinese companies can cause huge price fluctuations depending on how much they decide to produce or export, investors have been wary of pouring money into new ventures in the U.S..

That has made raising capital to build refining plants a big challenge for American companies trying to break back into the industry.

***""They're putting their money into things like Alphabet and, you know, Amazon and, you know, all the high-flying type of investments and just very, very little, if any, is coming into the mining industry,"" says Smith, the former CEO of Molycorp.***

***Some are still trying. Smith's new venture, NioCorp, is opening new mines and refining capacity for rare earths in*** [***Nebraska***](https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-rare-earths-mine-drilling/64626271)***.***

Phoenix Tailings, in Massachusetts, is also among a handful of American companies prepared to refine rare earths, by refining the tailings, or leftover waste, from mining companies.

[""We have to be full speed on the gas to make sure we're successful here](https://www.gpb.org/target%3D_blank),"" says Nicholas Myers, one of the co-founders and CEO.

The company already makes rare earth magnets for automotive and defense companies, and they are currently building a second plant in New Hampshire which the company says can meet about half of the U.S.' defense needs for rare earth products.

For years, Myers said his company struggled to attract investment at the magnitude needed to compete with Chinese firms in scale.

This year, things changed, after China implemented a licensing system for foreign companies which caused rare earth exports to plummet.

""Definite tone shift,"" says Myers, ""I think what happened is the end customers, the folks at the big automotive companies or defense primes, realized that they had told their bosses that China would never shut off the supply for them.""

But this spring, China did shut off that supply.

The cut off galvanized American investor interest in rare earths, says Myers. Phoenix Tailings [garnered](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250430735778/en/Rare-Earth-Metals-Refining-Company-Phoenix-Tailings-Closes-on-Additional-%2433M-in-Funding-From-Strategic-Investors-Bringing-the-Round-up-to-%2476M-to-Support-Rare-Earth-Metal-Independence) a major round of investment in May, and now, for the first time in decades, the U.S. may make rare earth minerals again.

# JULY 15th, 2025~Washington’s 30‑Day Sprint to Rewire the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chains

*Washington has seldom moved this fast on any industrial question, yet in the last month, Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court orchestrated a blitz of statutes, budget riders, executive memoranda, and precedent‑shifting rulings that together reset the rules of engagement for the critical minerals industry. What follows is a concise tour of the month’s pivotal moves—an accelerated summer sprint reshaping America’s critical minerals playbook.*

# Congress: From Tax Credits to Direct Appropriations

Seabed mining enters the legislative mainstream. On 18 June, Representatives Mike Ezell (R‑MS) and Mariannette Miller‑Meeks (R‑IA) [filed](https://ezell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1835) H.R. 4018, the Unleash America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources Act, embedding President Trump’s Executive Order 14285 in statute and instructing the Interior Department to license U.S. seabed mining in the exclusive economic zone — a deliberate counter‑weight to Beijing’s Pacific ambitions. House Natural Resources leadership and subsea‑mining start‑ups rallied behind the measure.

The budget carves a new channel. The House‑passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (May 2025) repeals the 10 % production credit (45X) created in 2022, arguing that a subsidy born in a climate bill no longer fits an “America‑First” minerals strategy. In its place, lawmakers earmark US$2.5 billion to buy domestically mined minerals for the National Defense Stockpile and US$500 million for low‑interest Pentagon loans. The Senate draft, released 28 June, mirrors the stockpile money, adds US$3.3–3.5 billion in Industrial Base Fund grants, and folds in a US$5 billion Defense Industrial Base investment facility. Passed on 1 July by the narrowest margin, the text now heads to conference; if [reconciled](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2236/2025-06-30-energy-sustainability-washington-update-july-2025), U.S. mineral policy will pivot from demand‑side tax credits to supply‑side federal purchasing and equity stakes.

Defense bills converge on minerals. Parallel FY‑2026 authorization bills in both chambers authorize a “Defense Production Act Credit Program Account” of US$500 million, channelling loans to lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare‑earth projects. Bipartisan framing as a national‑security imperative muted typical partisan fault lines.

# The Executive: Whole‑of‑Government Acceleration

One portal, less red tape. On 30 June President Trump [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/simplifying-the-funding-of-energy-infrastructure-and-critical-mineral-and-material-projects/) the memorandum “Simplifying the Funding of Energy Infrastructure and Critical Mineral and Material Projects,” mandating that Energy, Defense, Interior and peer agencies share applicant data, halt disbursements to firms that refuse, and, within 180 days, launch a single application portal so miners and refiners can tap multiple programs with one submission.

DOE pivots to materials. Five days earlier, DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy [released](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/energy-department-solicits-public-feedback-inform-2026-critical-materials-assessment) an RFI for the 2026 Energy Critical Materials Assessment, explicitly tying the work to Executive Order 14154 (“Unleashing American Energy”). Secretary Chris Wright has re‑aimed FY‑2026 R&D dollars toward geothermal, nuclear, and critical minerals, cancelling 24 climate‑demonstration projects worth US$3.7 billion.

*Permitting turbo‑mode.* After a 20 March Defense Production Act invocation, four mining projects (three uranium in New Mexico, one graphite in Alaska) obtained **FAST‑41** status, gaining legally enforceable review schedules on a public dashboard—evidence that the bureaucratic gears are indeed speeding up.

*Pentagon capital.* DOD’s Industrial Base Policy office highlighted recent **US $14.7 million** Title III awards \[Fortune Minerals Limited (TSX: FT | OTCQB: FTMDF) cobalt, Lomiko Metals Inc. (TSXV: LMR) graphite\] and previewed forthcoming rare‑earth separation and lithium‑processing calls, signalling that the dormant National Defense Stockpile is poised for its largest restock since the Cold War.

# Courts & Regulation: Narrowing NEPA, Trimming Agencies

*Chevron deference is gone, and NEPA just shrank.* Two Supreme Court decisions now shape every mineral [permit](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/05/supreme-court-limits-scope-of-environmental-review/). **Loper Bright v. Raimondo** (June 2024) ended four decades of automatic judicial deference to agency interpretation, while **Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (decided 24 June 2025)** [held](https://www.duanemorris.com/alerts/supreme_court_clarifies_narrows_nepa_scope_key_infrastructure_ruling_0625.html) that NEPA reviews need not examine “remote or speculative” upstream or downstream impacts. Agencies may focus on direct, on‑site effects, erasing a litigation tactic long used to stall mines or refineries.

*Executive downsizing of BLM.* A separate Supreme Court order (8 July 2025) lifted an injunction barring federal Reduction‑in‑Force plans, allowing Interior to proceed with layoffs that will cut \~1,800 Bureau of Land Management positions—effectively shrinking the cadre that once policed mine permits. Critics fear weakened oversight; miners see a faster lane.

*NEPA roll‑back on the table.* CEQ’s interim rule (25 Feb) rescinded prior NEPA regulations, and Interior’s May directive lets DOI waive or truncate reviews for “vital” mineral projects. Word in Washington is that a full statutory NEPA waiver for minerals could ride on the defence bill; early court signals suggest a sympathetic bench.

# Money: The Federal Spigot Opens

Draft appropriation language authorises US$2–2.5 billion for stockpile purchases and another US$3.5–5 billion in grants, loans, or equity for mines and processing plants—capital that commercial lenders view as loss‑absorbing first dollars. A new US$500 million pilot lending program will test low‑interest debt for projects banks shun. Agencies aim to issue solicitations as early as October 2025 so money can land inside calendar 2026.

Public‑private templates are multiplying. The U.S.–Canada scheme that co‑funded Fortune and Lomiko is widely cited as a roadmap: bilateral cash, private equity follow‑on, offtake contracts securing long‑term supply. Domestically, DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office continues seed grants—US$15 million this month for grid‑resilience storage systems that will absorb vanadium and lithium—and ARPA‑E’s MINER awards will inject > US$100 million into green‑extraction technologies for rare earths and battery metals.

# Trade: Detente with China, Alliances with Friends

*Rare‑earth truce (for now).* After Beijing throttled exports of rare‑earth oxides and magnets in May–June, U.S. and Chinese negotiators agreed on an **emergency 90‑day reversal**. President Trump’s early‑July press conference [claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-china-will-supply-rare-earths-us-allow-students-2025-06-11/) “full magnets up front,” but both capitals admit the arrangement is fragile; automakers have three months to build stockpiles before tariffs or quotas could re‑escalate.

*G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan.* Announced at Ottawa on 29 June, the plan commits members to pooled stockpiles, concerted investment in African and Latin American projects, and harmonised ESG‑plus‑security standards—practical steps toward an allied alternative to China‑centric refining networks.

*Section 232 probe.* The Commerce Department’s investigation into whether reliance on foreign refined lithium, cobalt, and rare‑earth alloys threatens national security is due 12 October. Should the verdict be affirmative, tariffs or quotas could follow, reshaping price curves overnight.

# Politics & Next Steps

White House messaging is unequivocal: critical minerals equal national security. Yet differences remain over method. Mining‑state Republicans hail the credit repeal; moderate Democrats warn that ripping away 45X could strand shovel‑ready projects. Former Senator Joe Manchin, testifying on 20 June, urged a balanced mix of **permitting reform plus stable incentives**. Consensus does exist on outcomes: de‑risk domestic extraction, end single‑supplier exposure, and restore industrial self‑sufficiency.

Agency road‑maps arrive soon. By late July, DOD will update its **National Defense Stockpile Requirements Report**, possibly adding copper and zinc to the “strategic” list. DOE’s 2026 assessment will redefine the “energy‑critical” roster next spring. A resurrected National Science & Technology Council subcommittee is drafting a 2025 **National Critical Minerals Strategy**, resetting targets for recycling, substitution, and workforce training.

# Why This Month Matters

A year ago, U.S. mineral security was a talking point. In the span of 30 days Washington produced: a seabed‑mining bill; a budget that swaps tax credits for cash and stockpiles; an executive memorandum that merges siloed funding streams; Supreme Court decisions that neuter expansive NEPA challenges; agency moves to accelerate permits; and an international dance that alternates détente with China and alliance‑building with G7 partners.

For investors, the headline is capital certainty: government purchase orders and grant money reduce project risk. For operators, permitting timelines now come with statutory clocks. For policymakers, the convergence of defence, trade, and climate narratives has forged an unexpectedly unified minerals doctrine. The next skirmishes—over 45X, over a possible NEPA waiver, over Section 232 remedies—will decide how rapidly theory becomes tonnage. But the direction is unmistakable: America is remaking its mineral base, and the policy cement poured this past month will harden into the foundation of that effort.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Ullr Hoback, Human KC Military Captain**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 17, 2160**

I slowly stir awake to a familiar weight on my back, but unlike most mornings, I know for a fact that I do not possess the strength to remove it from me, even if I wanted to. Her mass is like a hydraulic press confining me to my bunk. I let a ragged sigh go and curse under my breath. My back is in shambles, and the heavy lady currently resting on top of it carries much of the blame. Although I am definitely not innocent, as I was the one to suggest the physical activity in the first place.

*My body is broken. I should have known that being an old fuck would eventually catch up to me. Fuck skiing. This sucks ass.*

I give my best effort to stretch my legs, and immediately my back attempts to seize and fight against me. I let out a stifled cry as I raise my hand to the small of my back only to swat Artaya right in the face. My hand is quickly met by the sharp points of fangs as she nearly puts piercing pressure into my exposed palm. She tries to speak at me through garbled words while my hand remains perilously at her mercy.

“Uwllrh, ahm gohna gib oou wun hanse tuh eshpain wuhy oou jous swapp’d meh. Bwe vwery kerful wid yur wherds.”

*Should I be careful? Is sweet death the worst option here? I’ll be confined to this bed for the rest of my life otherwise. Also, that voice is hilarious.*

I turn my head and face towards Artaya, who is staring me down with murderous purple eyes.

“Okay, so you know how I’m old?”

Her ears flop backwards, and she releases my hand from her mouth as she tilts her head to the side.

“Old? Aren’t you younger than me?”

*Ah, hell, bad start, but the hand is free. Push on.*

“Oof, anyway, this whole skiing thing we’ve been doing for the past few days? Yeah, that’s a young person’s sport. My old and cold ass is ***not*** feeling it today. I don’t know if I’ll be able to get out of bed, let alone back on the snowmobile.”

“Oh… are you really that hurt? I-is it because you were carrying me?”

I slam my head into my pillow and take a deep breath as my unending stupidity dawns on me.

*Sonnuva fuckin’ bitch. That right there is why she prefaced it with choosing my words carefully. Okay, turn back and give it a take two.*

“No, that’s not it at all. While it didn’t help, skiing is for people in a lot better shape than myself, especially if you’re doing it all day for three days in a row.”

“Interrogation passed, Ullr, but this brings up a different topic; I guess we’re not skiing today?”

“Not a chance in hell.”

“Well, what do we do then?”

“What do you mean, ‘what do we do?’ You’re the commanding officer here!”

Her head sinks down onto my back, and she closes her eyes for a moment in thought before she suddenly jumps off of me and onto the floor of the camper. I twist my aching back and sit up at a rapid snail’s pace to turn and face the now tippytoe-dancing officer fox on the floor.

“We can go patrol the closest city to here! It’s a very intriguing case of Jaslip ice belt civic design.”

“That was, uh, Brother’s Gate, right?”

“Oh, you remembered! Do you think you know how to get back on that highway?”

“Sure, sure, but do you think we could get ready for the day first? I’ll repeat that I’m not exactly feeling as energetic as you today.”

“That’s nothing that a little breakfast can’t fix! Come on, let’s move!”

*Dammit, calm down. I’m going to collapse if I move much faster.*

As Artaya darts towards the dinette and takes her place on her side of the table, I slowly swing my legs to the floor and reach into the washer-dryer combo to switch from my night clothes to my day set of underlayers. I pretend not to notice Artaya’s gaze as I dress, but I quickly ready myself and shuffle over to the kitchen to start my cup of coffee. As the life-saving liquid brews, I reach into cold storage and bring out a slab of actual pork bacon fit for the finest greasy breakfast.

I sip on my coffee as the griddle makes quick work of the bacon strips, which are soon plated next to Artaya’s slightly warmed raw strips. I place the tray in the center of the table and take my seat across from her. She readily gobbles up her portion of the meal as I take my time slowly crunching on the greasy goodness.

“Ullr, this is the best bacon you’ve made so far. It’s perfect.”

“Well, of course you like it; all foxes love bacon.”

“Don’t call me a fox, you obor.”

“That’s why I call you a fox; I’m not going to claim to be all that different than one of those things. Hell, there’s probably a bunch that are better than me at skiing.”

“You kind of smell like one too.”

“Too far, fox. Too far…”

As we finish our roasting session and meal. I reluctantly make one quick use of the restroom before securing the camper interior and then suiting up in my riding gear. With my helmet on, I step out to the safe glade where I had kept the camper the past few days. Already waiting for me outside is Artaya, who is sniffing around some trees on the far edge of the glade. I activate the radio and give her a call.

“Hey, Colonel, find anything interesting out there?”

“New smell. It’s vaguely similar to ker but also so very different. It might be a native Esquo breed.”

“Stop chasing those wascally wabbits and let’s get going.”

I finish readying the camper and snowmobile for travel as Artaya finally arrives back and jumps up into her seat on the snowmobile. I throw my leg over the seat and settle into place as I ease into the throttle and get the consist moving. Making a great big circle around the campsite, I pull back onto the old road that had led us here and start back towards the city of Sister’s Refuge.

The road, like all others we have encountered, is littered with broken-down trucks and sled vehicles, all wasting away to the forces of time and weather in this arctic land. By my reckoning, I take us through and near the city center once more to cut through the trafficless streets and pop back out on the highway heading up to Brother’s Gate. As we pass by a small but semi-familiar grouping of buildings, Artaya suddenly barks into the radio.

“Oh, Ullr! Before we leave, can you turn right down the next street? It’s my parents’s house again, and I’d like to see it one last time.”

“Sure thing, but ‘one last time’? No plans to come back here?”

“Negative. We kind of are supposed to be scouting the cities or something, and staying in one city out of thousands isn’t going to be a good look when someone comes to check on us.”

*Check on us? Check on us!? Hah, ever hopeful, my fox friend. There is no way we aren’t here for good unless that terrorist radio thing somehow actually does call us away.*

I turn the snowmobile and camper down the pitted street and find that the surroundings are indeed very familiar from our first day in the city. I slow the consist down right in front of the old building and park it while Artaya quickly hops down off of her seat and trots right to the edge of the sidewalk. She then slowly sinks into a sit and stares at the crumbling stone with a head tilt. As I walk up to join her, I hear a sound that has pulled at my heart since the first day I met her. I come to her side and sit down on the ground beside her and listen to her soft crying. I throw my arm over her shoulder and pull her in close as she cries through her helmet.

“Hey, Colonel, what’s got you all upset?”

“It’s just not right.”

“What’s not right?”

“I know you have nothing to go back to on Earth, but we do. It’s right here; it’s all right here, and we pretend like it’s not. I know there are a lot of those Fed planets, but we have our own ships and shields. My family shouldn’t have been ripped away from a place like this. I shouldn’t be the only one to see it… I miss them all so much…”

I take my arm and fully turn her into my chest as she cries it out. Despite her armored vest and my gloved hands, I try my best to stroke her back as she regains her composure. After a bit, she has gone quiet and makes an effort to pull out of my hug. She stands back up and takes a few steps forward before bowing and trotting back to the snowmobile, where she jumps back onto her seat. I slowly stand my sore self off of the frozen ground and wobble back to the snowmobile and retake my driving position.

As I roll down the street, a glimpse of heat in the helmet's HUD catches my attention, and I turn to see a hulking creature slowly pacing us behind the houses in the neighborhood. I form a gentle smile as I realize that Artaya’s guardian is still making sure we are safe but respectful of those that never got to leave. I take us back to a main boulevard, and soon enough we are rolling down the original highway we had taken in from the landing zone. I feel a snout boop into my back, and without slowing down, I wait for her to come over the radio.

“Ullr, I’m sorry about back there. I was jus-”

“Hey, Colonel, no need to apologize. I’ve done it as well this trip.”

*Yeah, dead kids all piled on top of each other. No more bunker tours for this guy.*

“Thank you, Ullr… Say, Captain, why don’t you just call me Artaya all of the time?”

*I… huh, she does use my name a lot, but she’s always been more open. Still doesn’t change my rank, though.*

“Colonel, I call you that for two main reasons: this is a military expedition and you are my commanding officer & it is your official rank, and I know you worked really hard to deserve the promotion. If you want me to only call you Artaya, let me know.”

“Yeah… I-I don’t know about the promotion; j-just go with Artaya, please.”

“Sure thing, Colonel Artaya.”

“H-hey, you… Eh, whatever, Captain Asshole.”

“That I am! That I am.”

After a while of just ripping down the battered highway, we arrive at the bottom of the long mountain road. The weight of the camper strains at the motor on the snowmobile, but Alavel’s trusty iron steed powers up the slippery surface into the pass. We crest the top of the winding road, and as we drive on, I spot the busted-down rest stop where Artaya and I had taken that picture what feels like eons ago.

Artaya doesn’t comment on the sight as we roar on down and restart my favorite activity of scanning the road and dodging sketchy holes and burnt-out vehicles. As we round a bend in the road, I spot something I hadn’t wished to see ever again. A bus with windows splattered in what I understand is a horrid mixture of Jaslip and Resket blood. I slow the snowmobile down and point over at the sickening display.

“Hey, Artaya, is that bus really filled up that much with blood? What do you think happened there?”

“I can’t really smell anything from it, but yeah, that looks like an akalet worth of Jaslip and Resket innards. My guess is it was transporting some resistance members and was stopped by Resket soldiers. You can imagine what transpired from there.”

*The locals give a nice Esquo welcome to the invaders from the stars, handing out eviction notices.*

“Fuck, and you all are supposed to somehow coexist as one big happy government now?”

“Like I’ve said before, Ullr, the ones that weren’t leaving either died here or got shipped to Omnol, as far away from the rest of the Consortium as possible. Even then, terrorism from the Fighter’s Enclave is expected at this point, even if you’re not from there…”

“You know, if not for that reputation leading to you getting screamed at for nothing, how would we have ever figured out that you have all of the same scratch spots on your head as Earth foxes?”

“We were assigned to the same room, so I think it would have come up at some point.”

“Really, like you think I would’ve just pet you at some point?”

“Yes.”

“Damn… Yeah, that’s probably right.”

Letting the memory of my first day and our first encounter filter through my mind, I continue carving down the highway, mostly following the remains of the tracks we had left behind not all too long ago. I only give a quick glance to the mangled remains of the elk I had attempted to butcher. The image of the wicked akalet polar bear-thing flashes in my head, and I make haste to remove us from the area.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Artaya, Jaslip KC Military Colonel**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 18, 2160**

The sun has long faded behind the thick tree line to the west, and Ullr’s head has been bobbing up and down in exhaustion for what feels like half of the evening now. His head nearly dips down to the handlebars, and we take a hard swerve, barely missing a rather egregious crater in the center sledway. With a huff, I tap my nose into his back and call into the radio over the whipping winds in our face.

“Ullr, I think that’s enough for today. Just find somewhere okay to pull off before we crash off.”

“I-I yawww, am fine for at least another half—”

My desire to see the morning overrides his desire to prove himself to no one as I take my jaws and place them precariously over his shoulder and into his back and chest. He takes a glance at me and his shoulders slump as he immediately peels to the side of the sledway into a small clearing free of any vehicles or shrubs. After the motorsled is in park, I hop down and make my way to the door of the camper, not even waiting for the stabilizers to deploy.

I quickly remove my vest and helmet as I dart for the comfort of the steam shower in the corner room of the camper. Closing the door behind me, it only takes a moment for the nuclear-warmed snowmelt to spray wonderfully into my tense legs. The soreness from riding on a hard, waterproof seat all day melts away as the steam parts through my coat. I don’t spend much time under the jets, but it’s enough to revitalize me as I step back out into the camper, where Ullr is already cooking dinner. The smell of seared beef makes my tails wag despite my distaste for the cooked meats; the smell is undeniably divine.

I hop into my bench in the dinette and watch in worry as Ullr’s head continues its bobbing while he cooks on the stove. His only jolts back to this world come in the form of hot grease splashing back onto his hands. Thankfully he is soon done with his own dinner of meat and greens as well as my plate of warmed ‘top sirloin.’ He sets the plates in front of us as he takes his seat, and I waste no time in devouring the meal and chugging my water. He slowly eats through his plate, and as he finishes his food and drink, I decide to inform him of my plans for tomorrow.

“So Ullr, I think there’s probably only the rest of the morning for traveling, and then we should arrive at the South Vault Door for Brother’s Gate. From there, we can—Ullr?”

As I speak to him, his eyes slip closed and his head sinks into his chest. A pang of frustration quickly burns up and then fades out in my chest as my prepared plans fall on sleeping ears. I turn sideways to tap a tail on his face, but he doesn’t budge. With a sigh, I hop down and do my best to collect the plates and cups and put them in the sink. 

After making sure there’s nothing on my face, I walk up to Ullr and give him one more testing tap with a tail. Again, he doesn’t respond, and I decide to go through with my other plan. I use a tail to push him back into his seat as I jump up and onto his lap. Once I’m in a relatively comfortable position, I release him and let him fall forward onto my back.

*Hah, who’s sleeping on whose back now? I bet you-*

My own thoughts are cut short as I feel his arms wrap around my chest and he pulls his face down into the fluff on my back. I feel his gentle breathing go in and out of my freshly cleaned fur. I snuggle even closer to him and find my head tucked up into his arm. Closing my eyes, I feel content to drift off into sleep.

*I’ll just tell him in the morning about the structure of Gate. For now, he needs his rest. Goodnight, Ullr. I hope you know there’s no one I’d rather be on this planet with.*

On a sunny February day, Daisy drove down a highway through the golden wheat fields of Kansas with Carter in his Porsche 356/2 Gmünd Cabriolet. With the top down, Daisy's laughter filled the air as the wind blew through her hair, tickling her scalp. But she stopped seeing the look of abject terror on Carter's face.

""C-carter, sweetie, are you okay?""

""No, red, I don't think I am. I just realized I'm about to meet your mother for the first time, and I didn't bring so much as a gift.""

""Don't worry about that. Be your usual gentlemanly self, and Ma will love you. I have more to worry about than you.” Daisy spotted a mile marker, realizing they were still far from their destination. ”Carter, please stop the car.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he stopped the car in the middle of the highway, driving off the road to the side away from any potential traffic. And she held his hands as she looked at him with a frown covering her face, though not the one Carter recognized.

""I've been too cowardly to ask, but now it's do or die. When you all assumed I was dead. How did Aisha and Belle take it?""

""I wish I could tell you. I learned from Belle when she sent me a letter. And maybe it was wrong, but I didn't keep in touch with them.” Carter took his hand from Daisy, placing it over his face. “When I thought you died, it felt like life didn't have meaning anymore. Except maybe for finishing the war and getting revenge.""

""Carter, let's promise ourselves something right now. No matter what happens in this war. We fight for justice and not revenge.""

""There's a difference?""

Daisy grew a scowl, pulling Carter’s hand from his face to see fury like he had never witnessed before from his lover.

""Justice is about doing what's necessary to protect the innocent. However, revenge is getting hedonistic pleasure from inflicting harm on another.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he looked at her with a nod followed by a small smile. Seeing him, her scowl disappeared, her usual light-filled smile replacing it. 

Daisy kissed Carter. ”Let’s keep going.”

“Yes, ma’am.” Carter gently brushed Daisy’s chin with his hand.

\*\*\*

Carter’s car stopped as their journey was at an end. The two exited the vehicle holding hands as they cautiously walked forward. The couple gazed intensely at their destination, Lilyville. And a great silence spawned between them as neither knew the words to comment on the settlement that stood before them. In many ways it was simple, but it was that purest of simplicity that made it stand out from among the other fantastic places they knew.

It was a small rustic midwestern town in the middle of a vast green field adorned with hundreds of heavenly peace lilies and sunflowers. The scent of the flowers bombarded Daisy with a wave of nostalgia for her upbringing. She looked toward the fields, remembering the community celebrations, the church functions, and family picnics. It was a homely and peaceful land devoid of even the tiniest trace of the violent war outside its border. Almost detached from the rest of time as it marched forward for everywhere else.

Daisy cried. *""Home at last.""*

""I've never been anywhere like this before. And Daisy, do you hear that?""

Daisy positioned her ear to listen. ""I don't hear anything but the birds.""

""That's just it. There are no cars, trucks, or people shouting. It's as quiet as a grave.""

Daisy giggled. ""You'll get used to it, city boy.""

Daisy took Carter's hand and led him to her town, cracking a nervous smile. The couple swiftly approached Aisha's house. Every step Daisy took required herculean willpower, but as she got close, she faltered. However, with one kind look, Carter restored her resolve, and Daisy moved forward. But they stopped again momentarily as Daisy heard two familiar voices, Aisha and her father, Devon, participating in a shouting match.

*""Girl, leave this house and do something with your life,""* Devon shouted.

""Daddy, what's the point? My best friend is dead, and nothing matters. I wish I had died too.""

Aisha stormed out of her house and slammed the door behind her. She quickly burst out in a rage, beating the door until she broke down crying, a sorrowful mess on the ground. Daisy looked at Aisha, miserable, and hurried over to her friend. She quickly reached Aisha and made her look at her. But as Aisha saw Daisy, she crawled away, her face losing color.

*""My god, a ghost,""* Aisha said, terrified.

As Daisy heard Aisha, she took her hands.""Feel my hands, Aisha. I'm alive and well. So please don't say things like you want to die.""

Aisha quickly took note of Daisy’s hands. Unlike a spirit’s, her hands were warm and solid and she could notice the tremor of a pulse in her wrists. Her old friend was indeed alive. Aisha looked at Daisy as if she hadn’t seen her in eternity. Her eyes released a flood of tears, this time ones of joy, and she hugged Daisy tightly. Daisy reciprocated everything Aisha did. And the two young women clung to each other as they balled out on the ground.

\*\*\*

Daisy walked through the town with Carter and Aisha, heading toward her childhood house. As they made their way to the David family farm, they drew the gaze of the townspeople. And seeing Daisy back from the dead, they all hurried behind her to get an explanation for the miracle.

Meanwhile, Belle was still in bed even as the afternoon was minutes away. Surviving the deaths of her father and younger sister left her life without meaning. The young woman wallowed in her misery with her unkempt hair, malnourished body, and dirty nightgown in the loose bed sheets. She wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her days sleeping. But as Belle tossed and turned, she tumbled off the bed and hit the floor face-first. Belle burst into a crying fit until she heard a commotion outside. Using the last vestiges of her sanity, Belle struggled to her feet and staggered to a window to check. She saw Daisy outside with the crowd of townspeople, and life returned to her dead eyes

Belle dashed into the living room to her mother, Mary, on her chair. Mary was the spitting image of Belle but with Daisy's long, blood-red hair tied loosely at the end in a ponytail. She stared off into space, with her sunken, malnourished cheeks, clutching a frame with Daisy's baby picture inside as if it were the real thing. Like her eldest daughter, surviving her husband, Joseph, and Daisy’s deaths robbed her of much of her sanity. But Belle grabbed her hand, dragging her out of the living room.

Outside, Daisy prepared to open the front door. However, before she could, Belle and Mary ran out. And life quickly returned to Mary’s face as she saw Daisy standing before her.

Mary cried. *""By the lord in heaven, he raised you from the dead and sent you back to us.""*

""I-I never died, Ma.""

""What?""

""It's a long story, but I managed to escape the Nemesis. I wanted to call you all sooner, but things happened.” Daisy cried, wiping tears from her eyes. “I am so incredibly sorry for putting you all through this torture. Can you ever find it in your hearts to f-"".

Belle and Mary swiftly grabbed Daisy, giving her a monstrous hug. They fell to their knees, holding each other tightly, and Aisha burst into tears upon seeing them. As Mary saw Aisha crying, she dragged her into it.

""B-but I don't understand. How can you forgive me so easily?""

""Sissy, you're back with us, so nothing else matters.""

""Your sister took the words right out of my mouth.""

""Ma, in that case, can you do something for me?”

“What?”

“Please make some of your delicious apple pie?""

Mary giggled.""Of course, sweetie, anything you want.""

The family continued to embrace each other more joyously than before. When the townspeople saw them, they burst into a loud celebration. But Carter stood close by quietly, wiping small tears of joy from his eyes, seeing the happy family together again.

On the western side of United Planets territory, the gears of war turned faster and faster as battle broke out. Space was ablaze as the forces of the United Planets and the Nemesis fired seas of plasma at each other at the border between their territories, known as the great schism. But as both fleets tried to annihilate the other, Damara flew to the enemy on Flaremane, breaking the dead-heat.

She grew her shield to a giant size and tossed it at the Nemesis fleet. It cleaved through their forces as effortlessly as a knife would cut bread, creating a fiery line of destruction across the war zone. And as most of the enemy fleet went up in an inferno, the survivors retreated. 

But Daisy gazed deeply upon the violence and death of war, sighing.

“At least we won.”

Later, Daisy flew through space and reached the homeworld of General Favian, Planet Aqua. The planet was a titanic marshland. Water covered its surface as dense vegetation with all its strange scents fostered life from it. A world comprised solely of vast swamps with little solid ground. The only exception was the giant plants on which the natives constructed settlements. She flew to the largest one, on a lily pad of thousands of miles in diameter, Palus Urbs. A colossal city using towering plant life as buildings. 

As she headed for it, she made her way through busy skies. Daisy evaded United Planets ships as they hurried to complete their missions. ”Sorry.” As per Favian’s strategy, several of the planet's cities became fortresses, converting the world into a military stronghold. It would allow them to defend Aqua better and support future attacks. Eventually, they could use the world as a launching point for campaigns into enemy territory without straying too far from supply lines. Daisy soon landed, and Favian ran over to her as she dismounted from Flaremane.

Daisy saluted the general. “General Favian, my mission was a success. The enemy forces at the sector are in full retreat.”

“Excellent, Damara, this will be vital for our defense.” Favian looked closer at Daisy, noticing the tiredness in her eyes. “So why don't you look happy?”

“Nothing, sir. It’s stupid.”

“If it affects you, I better hear it anyway to be safe.”

“Well, I know there’s no choice but to fight. But this war still feels wrong.” Daisy took a deep breath. “To keep a long story short, my parents raised me to treasure life.”

As Favian heard Daisy, painful memories flashed across his face. ”So did mine. But unfortunately for the both of us, life isn’t fair.”

The two noticed a commotion nearby and spotted some soldiers chasing young aquis boys. But the little boys soon ran over to Daisy for refuge. As the soldiers reached them, Favian grew a scowl, shooting it at the soldiers.

""What are children still doing in this area? Especially since I ordered all civilians to the safe zone.""

""W-we were going to inform you about that, General Favian. The evacuation will take a bit longer than scheduled. As for those kids, they snuck past us when we were taking a little rest.""

*""Rest? Well, that's funny. Because Mavor won't rest until you are all dead.""* Favian shouted.

""General,"" Daisy said, seething, holding the boys. “There are children here.”

One of the boys tugged on Daisy's dress and got her attention. He spoke in the native language of Planet Aqua. But she was shocked as he didn’t say anything in Galactic Novice. It was a widely accepted tongue known to humans as simply English, but beings across the galaxy used it as an easy means of cross-species communication.

*""Ma'am, we're sorry that we broke the rules. We just wanted to meet you because you're a cool hero and super pretty.""*

Daisy cracked a smile as she finally recognized his tongue, uttering her next words in their native language.""I'm going to eat your souls.""

As the boys heard Daisy, they all burst into crying. And Favian's anger gave way to a sideways glance at his soldiers. But Daisy looked at their reactions, looking frantically between the two groups, unaware of what she said.

""D-Did I say something rude?""

Favian cracked a smile. ""Damara, please repeat what you said, but roll your tongue from the top of your mouth.""

Swiftly, Daisy heeded Favian's advice. ""You’re all sweet enough to eat. Bless your souls.""

The boys quickly stopped crying and grew big smiles. They all hugged Daisy, and she happily reciprocated.

""Damara, you'll save us. Right?”

""Yes, you'll be safe. I and many other brave men and women will make sure of it. And that's a promise.""

Daisy initiated a pinky promise with the boys. The boys quickly accepted it. As they did, Daisy was the only one who noticed her shield emitting faint light.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, thousands were scrambling across a military base outside the city. The United Planets base was situated on a lily pad several kilometers away from Palus Urbs of at least five hundred miles in diameter. It stood as the central hub of the Planets’ military action on the world. Coordinating the movement of numerous smaller bases across the planet’s surface with Carter and Favian as the dual commanding officers.

With Carter in command of the base, as Favian was still in the city, he directed his forces in a race against time. However, they moved remarkably efficiently despite the mounting pressure, accomplishing their jobs. But Carter soon spotted a familiar face amongst the loud hustle and bustle. A timid and reserved-looking fellow knocked about in the big crowd. Eugene, eighteen, was a skinny Caucasian human man. 

Carter hurried over to him. ""Good to see you, doc Parker. How was the trip? I heard our species still doesn’t take to space travel very well.""

Eugene staggered back and forth, fighting the urge to vomit. ""You heard right.”

“You’ll get used to it, soldier.” Carter chuckled.

“General Carter, may I ask you a question?""

""Shoot.""

""Well, first, I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is the chance of a lifetime.” Eugene vigorously rubbed the back of his head. “But there are far more experienced scientists who would kill to be your head scientific advisor. So why did you choose me? All I did was crack that code for darkhold.""

""That code saved lives, Dr. Parker.”

“Still, I’m only eighteen.”

“Doc, where I come from, boys need to become men fast.""

""Y-yes, sir.” Eugene exhaled heavily. “Oh, before I forget, I completed that project you gave me.""

“Really?”

As an answer, Eugene quickly dragged over a rectangular case. As he opened it, Carter looked at its contents no different than precious stones. It was a sword unlike any other. A beautiful long blue shining blade with black circuitry shimmering below its surface. With a nod of approval from Eugene, Carter slowly reached for the sword. His anticipation rapidly grew as he got closer. Finally picking it up, Carter smiled at how comfy it felt in his hand.

""What a girl she is. Does she have a name?""

""Yes, she is called the Betanian blade. Light as a feather but strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast. And when you swing her hard enough, she emits a powerful energy attack.""

""Man, I've seen a lot of beautiful women in my time, but she must be the runner-up.""

""Why thank you, I-.” Eugene cleared his throat. “Wait, you mean second? Who is the first most beautiful?""

Carter grew a smirk, thinking of Daisy. ""My business, that's who.""

Eugene saluted Carter, nervous as if he had done something wrong. ""Yes, sir.""

\*\*\*

The sunset and a horde of soldiers passed through the gates, returning from Palus urbs with Daisy and Favian leading them. And as Carter saw them, he hurried over.

""General Carter,"" Favian said indifferently.

""Favian,"" Carter said indifferently.

""So, General Carter, how was your end?""

""Pretty good, thanks to Dr. Parker. We're way ahead of schedule. How about you, Damara?""

""Not so lucky, I'm afraid. The evacuation will take at least another day.""

Favian swiftly walked away from Carter and Daisy.

""General Favian, where are you going?"" Daisy asked.

""There's something I need to check.""

Favian hurried across the base and quickly entered a building. Inside, he reached a computer room with rows of individuals typing away on the machines. And he soon found his Lieutenant, Yara. She was a beautiful Hachiko of twenty-four with a slender, curvy body that resembled a Siberian Husky.

Yara saluted Favian as she saw him. ""Glory to the lawgiver. Good evening, General Favian.""

""Same to you, Yara. Now tell me, how is General Carter's human doing?""

""Great. It's scary, but the guy can work our technology better than we can.""

Yara pointed over to Eugene on a holographic computer nearby. He stared at the big screen expressionless as his hands moved at inhuman speeds across the keyboard, inputting data. Favian looked at his work, his eyes widened, seeing him type away so fast without exhaustion. Almost as if Eugene was a machine himself. 

*""Dr. Parker, do you have a minute?""* Favian shouted.

Eugene stopped working in a daze, clutching his head from a headache. ""Oh, General Favian, when did you get here?""

""About a minute ago. And I would like a progress report.""

""W-well, my guardian barrier should be fully functional by tomorrow. And thanks to Damara, we can cast it over a massive area without the Nemesis being an issue.""

Favian took a deep breath.""I see. Please, keep up the great work.""

Favian prepared to leave, but without warning, alarms went off. He stopped cold, but with one look at Eugene, he ordered him to search for the cause. And Eugene typed away like the wind.

""My god, colossal enemy troop movement,"" Eugene said.

""They're coming back in force? Yara, we're at priority red. Everyone to their battle stations.""

""No, General Favian, please stop. The Nemesis are in a mass retreat.""

""What?""

""Our scanners verify it. Entire fleets of enemy ships fleeing this part of space.""

As she heard Eugene, Yara smiled, saluting Favian. ""Congratulations, sir. It looks like your defensive strategy has already borne fruit.""

Favian’s features hardened, placing his hand over his mouth. ""That's the problem. It only looks like that.""",1,1752836024.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1m2z5hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1m2z5hc/the_white_whale_of_my_masters_degree/,The White Whale (of my Master's degree),"Hello friends! Was attempting to study and had to take a moment to vent instead. I'm currently feverishly trying to finish my degree that has taken me WAY too long before the end of the year. I've enrolled in and subsequently dropped off of (more like ghosted) courses multiple times and have a dozen grades hanging in the air, usually due to one or two missing assignments. Nevertheless, I have been in somewhat of a groove lately and have organized the missing grades and their assignments in my journal for an easier time and have worked on them in a diligent manner.

But there is this one course, one subject that has bested me every time I have attempted to do it. I have been on the lectures again and again on multiple semesters, but have never been able to do the work, so to speak. It is the one course that has frustrated me to no end, my white whale.

It is an **Introductory course on Special Education.**

Yes, I know the situation is ironic as fuck. I've tried to complete the course before and after being diagnosed with ADHD/Asperger's in my late 20s some four years ago. But no cigar. The problem is, that it is a mandatory part of my degree on art education.

So, *why* do I find it so challenging? Because every time I open the slides or watch recordings of the lectures, my eyes start to immediately gaze over. I literally feel an instant overwhelm and a tinge of a headache. The assignments required for completion are set up in a confusing manner. There are different requirements and assignments for students of the different curriculums that participate in this module — which is fair enough — but why in the hell don't they have a cheat sheet to see what is required from each of them? I have to comb through all the assignments included in the slides to delineate the things I have to do. Which wouldn't be so bad, if the slides weren't laid out **like an eldritch nightmare designed by M.C. Escher.**

The slides are ironically, _ridiculously inaccessible_; it's nigh impossible to get an overview of the contents with a glance. There is no consistency in the layout, no two slides look the same. Some have two columns, some have one, some have multiple ones that are all different sizes and all over the screen! In 90% of the slides there is a ton of text overlaid on stock symbols, in different font sizes, colors and configurations. Some quotations have been emphasized by giving them their own slides, but then they have a drop shadow applied, which in tandem with the (serif) font choice feel like someone is trying to gouge my eyes out with glowing tongs.

You might be thinking ""well at least a ton of text is still manageable if there isn't too many pictures, right?"" Worry not, since every inch of remaining screen real estate is filled with symbols, comic strips, clipart, diagrams to completely suffocate the text. I am not dyslexic myself, but these slides make me empathize with our fellow neurodivergent brethren.

If you read this post in full, thank you for indulging in my rant. Now I will have a cigarette, get a cup of coffee and get back to work.

TL;DR: I'm trying to power through a module on Special Education, and the materials are, ironically, thorougly inaccessible.",1,1752835970.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

I have chipmunks demolishing my flower and veggie beds. I've tried everything at this point to keep them away and I've essentially exhausted non-lethal. Feral cats pick off one or two on occasion but it seems like they get replaced by 5 more. I've smoked, filled & flooded their holes, and dispatched probably more than 40 of them in the past 2 years with the .22 calibers of justice.

The beds are raised, about 8 inches. Every single combination of fencing and netting measures has failed. They find a way through the fence, chew through the mesh and net, etc.

Bonide and other types of mace powder keeps the bigger kids away very well, including smaller squirrels which is weird, but not the chipmunks 

Cayenne, coffee, garlic, oils, etc... and even fox urine, the same

Fake predators- I came outside this morning and saw them literally sitting on top of the snakes and about lost my shit, which is why I'm posting. Plus the feral cats play with them amd run off with them sometimes, which is super funny and makes me laugh, but it's a little annoying. 

I absolutely will not plant mint as a border. I don't have to explain my reasoning to this group.

I refuse to use poison for obvious reasons, but I'm asking for lethal small trap recommendations. I  just want to avoid buying ones that are junk, so if you have or know of a good brand for outdoors use and you could post a link I'd appreciate it.

I am here with a question and I am happy to hear your thoughts. Here is my story

In our community we have this group of customers who are just ... I find it hard to describe in english: probably a mixture of **Know-it-all + coffee lover + show-off + rude customer.**

As a coffee shop owner for almost 5 years (My coffee shop doesnt do espresso and only serve pour-over coffees), I get these types of customers quite a lot.

For example, a couple of years ago I had this couple walking into my shop. The lady was normal but her boyfriend or husband was that ""know-it-all"" guy I mentioned above.

He walked in, started to read the menu and asked me in a cold tone without even looking at me , ""what is the brewing temperature you use to make your Panama Gesha ?""

I said ""93 degrees celsius""

He replied with a rude scornful smile as if I said something so wrong, he said ""can you make one with 92 degrees? I only drink my gesha if it is brewed with 92 degrees. 93degrees will destroy the sweetness of the coffee.""

Then he turned to his girlfriend/wife, started to show-off he knowledge on gesha, things such as he had have hundreds cups of different gesha coffee from all around the world, he knew some coffee champions who make great gesha and etc..  
The lady was watching he saying all that, giving him an admiring gaze, as if that dude was explainning rocket science.

Well, I had to refuse because firstly, you had never tried my coffee with my brewing method before. You dont even know how fine I was going to grind my beans, how would you know that 92 degree brewing is better than 93? Secondly, if you are so professional and know so much about your coffee, why bother coming to a coffee shop which you dont even trust its barista's skill? Cant you just make your ""perfect coffee"" at home?

I kindly explain to him that I would make my coffee with my own standard because that's the purpose I open my own shop and serve customers with coffee with my own signature brewing style. If I made the coffee in his way but he didnt like it, we wouldnt know whose fault that would be.

Right after hearing my explanation, he got so mad and he face turned red. He grabbed his girlfriend's arm and walked out. He said he would never come again. (oh great!)

So here comes the end of my story. Do you have this same type of customers in your community? and what do you call them?",28,1752835807.0,barista,12,0.98,False
1m2z3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1m2z3mu/the_season_of_losing_friends_and_finding_myself/,The Season of Losing Friends (and Finding Myself),"**TL;DR:** Midlife loneliness feels brutal, but I’m starting to see it as a clearing — a chance to grow, shed old patterns, and make space for deeper, truer connections.

\~\~\~

I used to think something was wrong with me.

That’s the only explanation my mind could offer for why almost all my friendships have evaporated. There was a time — even into my 40s — when I could gather a group of girlfriends for a trip to Costa Rica without breaking a sweat. Now, I can’t even convince one person to meet me for coffee.

It stings. Even as a shy introvert, I liked having people orbiting around me. But somewhere along the way, I stopped orbiting around them.

Maybe that’s what really happened.

Because here’s the truth I’ve been reluctant to admit: most of my friendships weren’t healthy. They were built on my willingness to shrink, to edit myself, to swallow my own needs just to keep someone else comfortable. I didn’t realize how often I was camouflaging my true self — wearing the “good girl” mask, laughing at things that weren’t funny, accepting crumbs of connection to avoid being alone.

But I can’t do that anymore. I won’t.

So here I am. Alone, but not lonely — not always. Some days there’s grief. Other days, there’s a strange relief. Like my life force energy isn’t being siphoned off anymore. Like I finally get to keep it for myself.

There’s a season in a woman’s life where the phone stops buzzing. Invitations stop coming. Texts go unanswered — or maybe they never get sent at all because you already know the silence waiting on the other side.

At first, it feels like rejection. Like a verdict on your worth. But what if this is actually a rite of passage? A sacred threshold into something quieter and truer?

On a podcast recently, I heard someone say that our souls choose mortal, aging bodies because we want to experience every stage of life fully. I think about that often. What if this post-fertile phase is meant to feel different? When we’re younger, there’s a certain energy we carry — magnetic, fertile, vibrant — that draws others in (and often attracts parasites). 

After menopause, that energy shifts. It can feel like doors closing. But what if they’re doors you no longer need to walk through?

These days, I walk through the world unseen in a way I never could before. And to my surprise, invisibility feels like a gift. I’m not scrutinized, sized up, or consumed. I’m free to just *be*.

This isn’t to say the loss doesn’t ache. There’s grief in the empty spaces where friends once were. But I also see now that this season — this liminal clearing — is not the end. It’s the space before the next crop is planted. A quieting of the field.

I don’t know what kind of friendships might sprout in the future. But I do know this: if they come, they’ll grow from rich, authentic soil. No more tolerating what drains me. No more dimming my light for anyone’s comfort.

For now, I’m tending my own inner hearth. Learning to belong fully to myself. Sitting with the silence, and listening for the faint, steady drumbeat of what’s next.

My wife is a stay at home mommy, sometimes works a bit 

We have a 4 y old and an 9 years old

They go to school from 8am to 2pm

They are home at 3pm, and usually have a small lunch (because they dont really have a mid day lunch at school)

I come back around 7pm, and might have (2 times a week) work gatherings until 9pm let say

I can sense for a few months now that my wife feels that managing the nanny is not easy 

Nanny is full time she sleeps in our house
Her work schedule is roughly 7am 8pm 

Most importantly she cleans,  prepare school bags / lunch for kids 
Stay with them when we go out or wife goes out

What typical advice would you have to have this Nanny more efficient / autonomous ?

2 years ago with had a different Nanny who was more ""mom like"" a bit rough but had lots of initiative, it was a bit strange for my wife because the lady would just do it her way without asking

The one we had is much more discrete and quiet but,  I have noticed , but my wife says it surely, she is always asking / making sure she must do that "" madam, I do this now ? Madam , I do like that?"" Or "" sir, do i bring your coffee ? Sir I put the clothes away ?""

Are there general tips to apply (written schedule?l, etc ? ) for stay in full time nanny/maid?

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

What started as a streaming comparison quickly turned into something more… intimate.  
Turns out I’m in a complicated relationship with two very different women.

Spotify  
She’s gorgeous.  
Always dressed to impress. Smooth UI, snappy menus, colorful playlists.  
She talks a lot — maybe too much — but she’s funny. She gets what you like (or thinks she does), she brings surprises every week.

But she’s high-maintenance.  
You stop paying attention for a bit and she gets passive-aggressive. Suddenly your recommendations go sideways. You get spammed with playlists like “Mix 7 for you”, “Garage Psych Essentials (Probably)”, and worse — AI-generated filler tracks disguised as actual music.

She’s fun.  
But she’s exhausting.  
You feel like you’re dating an overachiever who secretly flirts with your friends.

Spotify sings you sweet songs while you walk hand in hand through the city.

Amazon Music  
Now this one’s… different.  
Let’s be honest: she’s ugly.  
Her app feels like something from 2011. You wouldn’t show her off in public.  
But she’s chill. No drama. No constant need for approval. She waits. Quietly.

And when you sit down and spend time with her?  
She opens up.  
Lossless, Ultra HD, Dolby Atmos — formats you didn’t know you needed until you hear them. It’s deep, textured, almost too much for casual listening. And yeah, it’ll eat your phone battery alive. But hey — at least she doesn’t pretend.

Amazon Music takes you to an empty concert hall, hands you a studio-grade headset, and says: “Listen to the air between the notes.”

And if I had to sum it up:

Spotify hands you a nice coffee in a plastic cup.  
Amazon Music serves you a fine espresso… in an abandoned squat.

I haven’t made up my mind yet.  
One is intense and shiny, the other weird and loyal.

I am here with a question and I am happy to hear your thoughts. Here is my story  
  
In our community we have this group of costomers who are just ... I find it hard to describe in english: probably a mixture of **Know-it-all + coffee lover + show-off + rude costomer.** 

As a coffee shop owner for almost 5 years (My coffee shop doesnt do espresso and only serve pour-over coffees), I get these types of costomers quite a lot. 

For example, a couple of years ago I had this couple walking into my shop. The lady was normal but her boyfriend or husband was that ""know-it-all"" guy I mentioned above. 

He walked in, started to read the menu and asked me in a cold tone without even looking at me , ""what is the brewing temperature you use to make your Panama Gesha ?""

  
I said ""93 degrees celsius""

  
He replied with a rude scornful smile as if I said something so wrong, he said ""can you make one with 92 degrees? I only drink my gesha if it is brewed with 92 degrees. 93degrees will destroy the sweetness of the coffee."" 

Then he turned to his girlfriend/wife, started to show-off he knowledge on gesha, things such as he had have hundreds cups of different gesha coffee from all around the world, he knew some coffee champions who make great gesha and etc..  
The lady was watching he saying all that, giving him an admiring gaze, as if that dude was explainning rocket science. 

  
Well, I had to refuse because firstly, you had never tried my coffee with my brewing method before. You dont even know how fine I was going to grind my beans, how would you know that 92 degree brewing is better than 93? Secondly, if you are so professional and know so much about your coffee, why bother coming to a coffee shop which you dont even trust its barista's skill? Cant you just make your ""perfect coffee"" at home? 

I kindly explain to him that I would make my coffee with my own standard because that's the purpose I open my own shop and serve costomers with coffee with my own signature brewing style. If I made the coffee in his way but he didnt like it, we wouldnt know whose fault that would be. 

Right after hearing my explanation, he got so mad and he face turned red. He grabbed his girlfriend's arm and walked out. He said he would never come again. (oh great!) 

So here comes the end of my story. Do you have this same type of costomers in your community? and what do you call them? ",3,1752834709.0,SpecialtyCoffee,0,1.0,False

1m2yrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m2yrcq/qualitative_simplicity/,Qualitative Simplicity,"Here's my take. Started with [Coffeegeek.com](http://Coffeegeek.com), Chris Coffee. Isomac then a plumbed in Vetrano 20 years ago. Mazzer Mini with doser. At the time the doserless idea was just starting. But I liked grinding for multiple shots for family and friends so I stuck with the doser. My technique was a palmful of beans per shot. Add beans to portafilter. Level off with my finger. Manual tamp to 30lb, using a bathroom  scale to understand tamping  pressure. Almost always the top of the piston on my Espresso Parts tamper would be even with the top of the basket. Looked for a 20-25 second 2 oz pull. Interestingly, Jim from 1st Line seems to do this even today. 

Big debate at the time on Coffee Geek forums was flat or curved bottom. I wasn't sure and settled on a slightly convex one. I was making the best espresso anyone I knew ever had with a few varieties of beans from Paradise roasters or Nizza Lacolombe, from Phila area where I am. 

Fast forward. Vetrano fails after 18 years. And I have been watching Hoffman and Hendrik on youtube. 

New Vetrano, Niche Zero. So I get a scale to weigh my 18g. Normcore leveling tamper. WDT. Aiming for the 1:2  ratio 25-30 second shot. 

After a few weeks, I am not so sure that all this matters for a nice tasty shot straight or with some steamed milk cortado volume for my wife. 

I think the doser shakes up the finely ground coffee enough so that WDT isn't needed. And eyeballing 2 oz pulls still tastes great. 

I advocate a return to qualitative simplicity. That's what I am calling this method.  ",2,1752834590.0,espresso,1,0.67,False

I’d be so grateful if you could:

- Make sure everyone’s eyes are open and looking toward the same camera (I have more photos if there’s a person you’re struggling with!)

- Clean up the photo a bit by removing the exit sign and any other small fixes to make it frame-worthy (I trust your keen eyes more than mine haha)

1m2youd,https://i.redd.it/v0gt7avrzldf1.jpeg,Almond Croissant back in the UK,"It's not on the Nespresso UK website yet but is being offered to subscribers. I opened the app yesterday morning, spotted it, and promptly ordered 5 sleeves. They should be arriving in around 55 minutes and I can't wait!

It's only a matter of time before it shows on the website and becomes available to all. Seeing the return of Almond Croissant has renewed my hope that Peanut & Roasted Sesame will come back. 😊",7,1752834344.0,nespresso,6,1.0,False
