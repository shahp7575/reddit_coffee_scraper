1m30we1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Quality4576/comments/1m30we1/how_ai_is_revolutionizing_work_efficiency_and/,How AI is Revolutionizing Work Efficiency and Speed in 2025,"As we navigate through 2025, artificial intelligence has become as commonplace in our workplaces as morning coffee and Monday meetings. Yet, unlike that familiar cup of joe, AI‚Äôs effects on our professional lives are far more complex and nuanced. While some herald it as the ultimate productivity booster, others warn of its potential pitfalls. The reality, as with most transformative technologies, lies somewhere in between.

**The Acceleration Revolution: How AI is Supercharging Workplace Efficiency**

The most immediate and tangible benefit of AI in the workplace is its ability to handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks with unprecedented speed. In 2025, we‚Äôre seeing AI systems that can process thousands of documents in minutes, analyze complex datasets in real-time, and generate initial drafts of reports faster than any human could type. This isn‚Äôt just about replacing manual labor; it‚Äôs about freeing up human cognitive resources for more strategic, creative work.

Consider how AI has revolutionized customer service operations. Chatbots now handle 80% of routine inquiries, allowing human agents to focus on complex problem-solving and relationship building. Similarly, in content creation, AI tools can generate first drafts, suggest improvements, and even optimize content for different audiences, transforming writers from creators to curators and editors.

The impact on internal communication has been particularly striking. AI-powered platforms now summarize lengthy email threads, schedule meetings based on everyone‚Äôs availability and preferences, and even translate messages in real-time for global teams. These systems have eliminated much of the administrative overhead that once bogged down collaborative work, allowing teams to focus on actual collaboration rather than coordination logistics.

**The Creative Catalyst: AI as ‚ÄúThe Storyteller‚Äù**

One of the most fascinating developments in 2025 is AI‚Äôs emergence as ‚Äú[the storyteller](https://www.ticworks.com/)‚Äù in business contexts. Beyond simple data analysis, AI systems now craft compelling narratives from raw information, helping organizations communicate complex insights to stakeholders. Marketing teams use AI to generate personalized content at scale, while executives rely on AI-generated executive summaries that don‚Äôt just present facts but weave them into coherent, actionable narratives.

This storytelling capability has proven invaluable in industries ranging from healthcare, where AI helps doctors explain complex diagnoses to patients, to finance, where AI transforms dense market data into accessible investment stories. The speed at which AI can generate these narratives has accelerated decision-making processes across organizations.

**The Productivity Paradox: When Speed Becomes a Trap**

However, the AI revolution isn‚Äôt without its shadows. The very speed that makes AI so attractive can become a double-edged sword. The pressure to match AI‚Äôs pace has led to what researchers call ‚Äúproductivity anxiety‚Äù ‚Äî a condition where workers feel constantly pressured to perform at machine-like efficiency levels.

Moreover, the rapid output of AI systems can overwhelm human decision-makers. When an AI can generate dozens of reports, hundreds of content pieces, or thousands of analysis points in a single day, the bottleneck shifts from creation to evaluation. Many organizations are discovering that having too much AI-generated content can be as problematic as having too little human-generated content.

**The Human Element: What We Lose in Translation**

Perhaps the most significant concern about AI‚Äôs impact on work efficiency is the potential erosion of human skills and intuition. As AI systems become more sophisticated, there‚Äôs a risk that workers may become overly dependent on these tools, leading to a decline in critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.

The phenomenon is already visible in various fields. Accountants who rely heavily on AI for analysis may lose their ability to spot anomalies that don‚Äôt fit algorithmic patterns. Writers who depend on AI for ideation might find their own creative muscles atrophying. Even in ‚Äú[internal communication](https://www.ticworks.com/services/internal-communications)‚Äù Over-reliance on AI mediators can reduce the authentic human connections that often drive innovation and team cohesion.

**The Quality vs. Quantity Dilemma**

AI‚Äôs ability to produce work at breakneck speed has created a new challenge: maintaining quality while maximizing quantity. While AI can generate content, analysis, and solutions faster than ever before, the nuanced judgment required to ensure quality often still requires human oversight. This has led to a new type of workflow where speed is balanced against the need for human verification and refinement.

Organizations are learning that the most effective approach isn‚Äôt to let AI run unchecked but to create hybrid workflows where AI handles the heavy lifting while humans provide strategic direction and quality control. This balance is crucial for maintaining both efficiency and excellence.

**The Skills Evolution: Adapting to an AI-Augmented Future**

The workforce of 2025 is rapidly adapting to this new reality. The most successful professionals are those who have learned to work alongside AI rather than compete against it. This means developing skills in AI prompt engineering, understanding how to effectively collaborate with AI systems, and maintaining the uniquely human abilities that AI cannot replicate ‚Äî such as emotional intelligence, creative thinking, and ethical judgment.

Training programs are evolving to focus on these hybrid skills. Companies are investing in ‚ÄúAI literacy‚Äù programs that teach employees not just how to use AI tools but how to think critically about AI outputs and maintain their own professional judgment.

**Looking Forward: The Sustainable AI Workplace**

As we progress through 2025, the key to harnessing AI‚Äôs benefits while avoiding its pitfalls lies in creating sustainable AI integration strategies. This means designing workflows that leverage AI‚Äôs speed and efficiency while preserving human creativity, intuition, and well-being.

The most successful organizations are those that view AI not as a replacement for human workers but as a powerful tool that can amplify human capabilities. They‚Äôre creating environments where AI handles routine tasks, freeing humans to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationship building ‚Äî the areas where human intelligence still reigns supreme.

The future of work efficiency isn‚Äôt about choosing between human and artificial intelligence; it‚Äôs about finding the optimal balance between speed and thoughtfulness, automation and creativity, efficiency and humanity. As we continue to navigate this AI-augmented workplace, the organizations and individuals who succeed will be those who can harness the power of AI while maintaining the essential human elements that drive innovation, empathy, and meaningful work.

In this new landscape, the question isn‚Äôt whether AI will continue to transform work efficiency and speed ‚Äî it‚Äôs how we‚Äôll shape that transformation to serve not just our productivity goals but our human values and aspirations as well.",1,1752841393.0,u_Ok-Quality4576,0,1.0,False

Venice is just a blessing if you love sitting in water with peace. As I was travelling solo, I ditched the Google map and wandered subtly in the streets of Venice. Here I bumped into a hidden bookstore and a small cafe where I had the best coffee of my life.¬†

**Italy = The FOOD**

Handmade pasta in Bologna, seafood risotto on the¬† Neapolitan pizza in Naples, on the Amalfi Coast, every meal was like a warm hug. I even took a pasta-making class with a nonna in Florence, and yes, I cried happy tears.That was just a few moments.

Ava followed a step behind, her gaze flitting over the peeling paint, the dusty window, the small things no one noticed unless they were new.

‚ÄúCareful of the third step,‚Äù Jeffrey muttered without turning. ‚ÄúCreaks loud enough to wake the dead.‚Äù

Ava nodded. Her foot hovered a moment before continuing, light and sure.

The apartment door stuck a little, then gave way with a shoulder nudge. The space beyond was clean, if lived-in: muted walls, a threadbare couch, a cluttered desk littered with open circuit boards and mugs with ancient coffee stains. Books were stacked along every surface like forgotten ruins.

Ava stood just inside the doorway, taking it in quietly.

Jeff dropped his keys into a bowl shaped like a cat‚Äôs mouth and glanced back at her. ‚ÄúNot much, but it‚Äôs home. You hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could eat,‚Äù she said, voice smooth but soft. A little cautious.

He gestured toward the couch. ‚ÄúMake yourself at home. I‚Äôve got leftover noodles from Bao‚Äôs down the street. Still edible, probably.‚Äù

Ava perched on the edge of the couch‚Äînot stiff, just... deliberate. Like someone unused to taking up space. She ran her fingers lightly along the seam in the cushion, feeling the texture like it meant something.

Jeffrey‚Äôs microwave beeped as he glanced her way again. ‚ÄúYou okay? You‚Äôre kinda... quiet.‚Äù

She smiled, small and practiced. ‚ÄúStill finding my footing. It‚Äôs been a strange day.‚Äù

That was an understatement, but he didn‚Äôt press. Who *wasn‚Äôt* walking around a little cracked lately?

He handed her the bowl of noodles and a fork, watching as she twirled them deftly, like someone who‚Äôd done it a hundred times. Nothing weird. Nothing ‚Äúoff.‚Äù But something about her movements still felt *intentional*, like every word and gesture was being gently tested before use.

Her eyes drifted to a faded photo pinned to the bookshelf‚Äîa teenage girl with a bright grin, throwing peace signs at the camera.

‚ÄúYour sister?‚Äù

‚ÄúWas.‚Äù He rubbed the back of his neck. ‚ÄúWent missing a few years back. Cops gave up. I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Ava looked at him then‚Äîreally looked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Jeff nodded, lips pressing into a line. ‚ÄúYeah. Me too.‚Äù

There was a silence. Not awkward. Just... present.

‚ÄúI can sleep on the couch,‚Äù Ava said.

Jeff blinked. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even ask you to stay yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But I can tell you want to offer. And I‚Äôd rather be somewhere with a locked door tonight.‚Äù

He let out a breath, half a laugh, half something heavier.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre real good at reading people.‚Äù

She met his gaze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a lot of practice.‚Äù

Jeff turned toward the kitchenette, busying himself with a mug and half-stale tea. ‚ÄúAlright. Couch is yours. Spare blanket‚Äôs in the basket by the window. Bathroom‚Äôs through there‚Äîdoor sticks a bit.‚Äù

She moved past him lightly, brushing close. Warm. Real. A little too composed, but not enough to seem strange. Just... well-raised. Or maybe well-wounded.

She didn‚Äôt notice.

I was flirting with this guy at our local coffee shop for a few weeks. We had this great banter, and I'm pretty sure he was into me. He kept making these subtle flirty comments and we even exchanged numbers. But here's the twist... I mustered up the courage to text him a 'hey, wanna grab a drink sometime?' message. Radio silence since then. ü§î 

Was I reading into it too much, or is he just bad at signaling? Anyone else had a similar experience or any tips on decoding mixed signals? Help a girl out!",5,1752840187.0,FlirtFinesse,1,1.0,False

I'm 41F and 14kg overweight and I'm single and all my friends have husbands and kids and it's the middle of winter and my admin list is overwhelming and I haven't gone to the gym for a month. And I just tired my 6th round of IVF on my own to have a baby and it failed.

I was going to start tomorrow and
- go to bed at 9pm
- wake up and exercise every morning, before walking the dog, before work 
- delete all social media except reddit off my phone 
- walk the dog every day after work
- try to do one hour or admin work each evening 
- cook healthy meals ahead of time and freeze them
- stop snacking during the day. 3 meals and 1 apple and 1 banana
- stop drinking coffee or milky drinks 
- start writing a gratitude top 5 each night
- meditate for 20mins each night before bed

Is there anything else I can do to turn my life around? I want to be in a different place in 8 weeks.",3,1752840177.0,GetMotivated,12,0.67,False
1m30h0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1m30h0l/found/,Found,"The rain had stopped an hour ago, but the city still glistened under the streetlights‚Äîwet asphalt like spilled ink. Steam curled up from sewer grates. The world smelled like old smoke, wet concrete, and the ghost of fried food.

Jeffrey stepped out the back of his repair shop, tugging the hood of his jacket up as he lit a cigarette. The flick of his lighter briefly lit up the chipped bricks around him, his face worn by late nights and too much coffee. The buzz of the neon sign still hummed faintly behind him: **YIELD TECH REPAIRS**.

He wasn‚Äôt expecting company.

That‚Äôs when he saw her.

She sat on the edge of the alley, knees drawn up, arms around them. Barefoot. Hair plastered to her face, skin smeared with city dust. But there was something‚Ä¶ strange. Too still. Too composed. Her eyes didn‚Äôt dart around the way you‚Äôd expect from someone in trouble‚Äîthey were fixed calmly on the cars beyond, tracking taillights like shooting stars.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Jeffrey called out, cautious.

The woman blinked, slowly, then tilted her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet. I think I might be.‚Äù

Her voice was even. Too even.

He took a drag on his cigarette, watching her through narrowed eyes. She didn‚Äôt look high. Or drunk. No tremor in her hands. No twitch in her face. Just‚Ä¶ off.

‚ÄúDo you need help?‚Äù he asked, careful to keep his tone neutral.

‚ÄúI think I do. But I‚Äôm not sure what kind.‚Äù She smiled faintly, like a crooked apology. ‚ÄúSorry. I‚Äôm a bit scrambled.‚Äù

Jeffrey stepped closer, one slow step at a time. She didn‚Äôt flinch. Up close, he could see the oddities more clearly‚Äîperfect skin, no visible bruises or scratches despite her being out in the rain. Her clothes were too clean for someone living rough, but slightly too disheveled to be freshly changed. Her hair was wet, but her eyes were dry. She met his gaze directly, without hesitation.

‚ÄúNo ID?‚Äù he asked.

She shook her head.

‚ÄúName?‚Äù

A pause. ‚ÄúAva. I think. It‚Äôs the one that feels right.‚Äù

Jeff frowned. ‚ÄúFeels right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI tried a few. ‚ÄòJessica‚Äô was all wrong. ‚ÄòSarah‚Äô made me want to punch a wall. But Ava‚Ä¶‚Äù she looked up at the clouds, like listening for an answer, ‚Äúthat one fits.‚Äù

His stomach twisted‚Äînot with fear, but familiarity. His younger sister used to talk like that. Before she disappeared. A decade ago, just‚Ä¶ gone. A runaway? Abducted? Nobody ever found out. But the not-knowing had carved a hollow space in him, one he never quite managed to fill.

He flicked his cigarette to the wet ground and crushed it underfoot.

‚ÄúDo you have anyone? Friends? Family?‚Äù

Ava hesitated. ‚ÄúNo. Not anymore. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm what they‚Äôd want to find.‚Äù

That landed harder than he expected.

Jeffrey studied her again. The vulnerability was subtle, buried deep beneath that eerie composure‚Äîbut it was there. Real or not, it was enough.

He sighed, rubbing the back of his neck.

‚ÄúWell, Ava,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a couch, a half-dead heater, and some leftover noodles if you‚Äôre hungry. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs dry.‚Äù

Her smile flickered‚Äîgrateful, gentle. And again, that strange warmth in her eyes, too human to fake.

‚ÄúYou have no idea how much I needed noodles right now.‚Äù

He turned and gestured for her to follow.

As she stood‚Äîfluidly, like a dancer masking a limp‚Äîhe caught something else in her expression. Relief, yes‚Ä¶ but also fear. Not fear of him. Fear of being seen too closely.

He didn‚Äôt press. Not yet.

But something deep in his gut told him: this girl wasn‚Äôt just lost.

She was hiding.

And whatever she was hiding from... it wasn‚Äôt just the street.

Before starting meds for ADHD, I had occasional extrasystoles. I had gone to the E.R. when I was on over 3 hours of near constant PVCs.

Now I never quit drinking coffee when I started the meds, and my b.p. has always been normal-high (130s/70s).

I started the meds last October, but the last month or two, I've gone from occasional PVC bouts (a few times per month, sometimes twice or three times per week) to now every day, and sometimes several hours per day.

A basic Wiki is now¬†[here](https://slimwiki.com/ragnaroknrol-limited/getting-started/welcome).

**May 24**

‚ÄúWait, the boss slept with you?‚Äù¬†¬†Jacob says this far too loudly.

I walk over. ‚ÄúWe live together and nothing happened. If you ever blurt out something that loudly again about me and a partner, with guests in the room, you will be cleaning the bathrooms every shift you have. FOREVER. I will buy a toothbrush for you to use.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoblins use the toilets.‚Äù

My anger fuels my answer, ‚ÄúAnd then I don‚Äôt have to pay a professional service to clean the restrooms when I can have employees, you specifically, do it, now do I?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, it will never happen again, ma‚Äôam!‚Äù¬†¬†His military time always shows up when I remind him of Gunny. Whoever the hell that is.¬†

I turn to my roommate, best friend, and now troublemaker.

‚ÄúYou, office, now.‚Äù¬†¬†Jackie whitens at my tone.¬†

She is wearing a skirt that while technically is within dress code, it is doing a lot of work to make you think it isn‚Äôt.¬†¬†*Bitch is sashaying in front of me as she goes.*¬†

We pass Mommy and Connie talking and Connie glances at us with a look of worry.¬† I almost slam the door.¬†¬†I catch a glimpse of someone imagining us passionately kissing. Yeesh. I gotta stop this. Jackie looks up at me expectantly.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe have a weird situation. I was just your shift supervisor when we became friends. I was your manager when we moved together. I now own this franchise and rent a place from a centaur with you. And I have told you about my darkest moments over ice cream.‚Äù

She nods. *She looks so worried.*

‚ÄúI love you Jackie and I am not wanting to lose you. You are my best friend and, honestly, an amazing roommate. So, PLEASE, stop saying things that could cause me to lose my license with Corporate.‚Äù

Her face reveals total shock.¬† Horror follows it fast. She didn‚Äôt think about something like that being possible.¬†

‚ÄúI am an owner. If they think I am having sex with a shift supervisor, I am on the chopping block, not you. Because I am in the power position. Hell, they might look at your position and think it was due to bias or bribery.¬†¬†Stop saying things like that here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I was just unbearably happy. He asked why and I blurted it out.‚Äù¬† She looks upset and something I can‚Äôt place.

‚ÄúSleeping next to my snoring ass that drooled on your pillow made you happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Laying awake nearly the entire night next to you did.¬†¬†Look Pat‚Ä¶ I need to‚Ä¶I need to tell you that I am in lo‚Ä¶‚Äù

The crash outside interrupts us. I‚Äôll have to ask about this later.¬† I walk out and see 2 customers beating the hell out of each other. One is a human, and he is getting in a brawling match with a hobgoblin.¬† Not a great match up for him.¬† Jacob doesn‚Äôt know what to do and Grace is wisely just trying to keep up with drive thru and not get involved as she would get hurt.

At about 6‚Äô tall I am actually intimidating to some people. I go to break them up and the human doesn‚Äôt even notice me.¬† I get pushed a bit by the hobgoblin.¬† I feel something hit my foot.¬† The other guy seems to finally notice me now as I continue to tell them to knock it off.¬†

Wait, he just now noticed me?¬† That thing hitting my foot was my charm‚Ä¶ Shit!

¬†The human then gets a serious face and punches me in the nose. I feel a familiar crunch.¬† God dammit!¬† The pain is still blinding, if familiar.¬† That is bad enough, but he follows immediately with another to my jaw. ¬†¬†He hits like a pro.¬† This was a set up?¬† And he wants me dead; I can feel it.¬† Like the knife attack.¬† My world goes white with pain from that uppercut, and I feel myself falling, I see his fist coming for my face as I hit my head on the corner of the table.¬† Oh fuck!

I hear noises that can‚Äôt be human and a commotion.¬† Multiple hands grab me and move me. ¬†There‚Äôs panic in there.¬† I hear rage and screaming.¬† ¬†Is that a cat hissing?¬† And cooking?¬† I can barely open my eyes. The pain from the light is so horrible. People yelling to get her off him. Weird, I am not on anyone. Next thing I can see is Jackie. Her face is wet from tears and blood? She is kind of blurry. She is saying something, but the pain is so much I can‚Äôt hear anything above the ringing in my ears. Opening my eyes is blinding.¬† So much light.¬† She holds up fingers in one hand. Why are they covered in blood?¬† I think she wants me to say how many she is holding up on that hand.¬† *Silly thing.¬†¬†I mean it is obvious.*¬† I blurt out ‚Äú6.‚Äù¬† See?¬† Obvious.¬† The look on her face tells me I was probably wrong.

More hands. More noise. Oh hey, police lights. Cops are here. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have donuts‚Äù. I am sure they will understand.¬†¬†Maybe I should comp them some coffee?¬† We do have pastry, I should offer them some. They look worried too.¬† *Is my nose that much of a mess?¬† I can straighten it out.¬† Just need a mirror, good as new.¬† Done it before.*¬† I hear a loud ‚Äúfuck me.‚Äù And I start trying to get a good grip so I can straighten it when like 4 sets of hands grab me and make me stop. What the hell, I can‚Äôt have my nose any more crooked.¬† ‚ÄúNeed to fix it, I‚Äôm already ugly enough.‚Äù

Crying.¬† Yelling. Another commotion.

‚ÄúNOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!¬† I WILL KILL THAT FUCKER!!!‚Äù

I think someone else just got attacked. Wonder who?¬†

*Oh hey, those guys look like EMTs. Oh crap. Someone got hurt. Wonder who?¬† Probably that guy that hit me.¬† Oh crap.¬† That is going to be paperwork and insurance and hey, why is one of them shining a light on my eyes one at a time?*¬†¬†*Ouch. STOP THAT!!! Oh crap.¬† What is going on? Why is May signing like crazy?¬†¬†She okay?¬†¬†I really think she is perfect for Lemar. Oh wait..¬† Jackie is really angry. She is yelling at this rather good looking guy*. He has kind green eyes.¬† OH!!!¬†¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt yell at him, he‚Äôs cute. Cuter than Mark. He also has free coffee.¬† He helped me save your life.¬† Look, she‚Äôs okay!¬† You should date‚Ä¶‚Äù

I just got shushed by her!!!¬†¬†*Wow. How brazen!*¬†¬†She has her hands on the sides of her waist and is posed like some anime heroine that is going to beat the crap out of a bad guy. *Heh, a super curvy and busty Asuka.¬† She‚Äôs a Tsundere people, watch out!!*

*‚Äú*GOD DAMMIT PAT QUIT BROADCASTING!‚Äù¬† *Jackie‚Äôs yelling at me.¬† I hate that.*

*Oh shit. Sorry‚Ä¶* sorry. That better?¬† Heh. They won‚Äôt answer it if it is. Heheh.¬† Whoops. Everything is so fuzzy.

The EMT finally gives up. I think he says something about us being a couple.¬† A couple of what?¬† Oh? A stretcher?¬†¬†For the hurt person!¬† Why am I‚Ä¶ Oh?¬† Oh.¬†¬† OHHH‚Ä¶!!!

The hurt person is me.¬†

I‚Äôm the hurt person.¬†

THE HURT PERSON IS ME?!?!¬†

I‚Äôm hurt?¬† Oh. Yea. Makes sense. Got it.¬† Wait.¬† Well fuck.¬† OH CONCUSSION!!!¬† Why didn‚Äôt I recognize this?¬† Been 6 years, guess you forget how they feel. Also, my jaw isn‚Äôt broken but hurting too. I know the difference.¬† That probably didn‚Äôt help. Oh*, and nose. Man, I really am a mess. I really gotta straighten‚Ä¶. Just grab it and‚Ä¶AWWWW COME ON LET ME FIX IT!¬† Why do they always stop me?¬† Gonna stay ugly if I can‚Äôt fix it.*

Lights. I see Jackie. She is telling me it will be alright.¬† *Of course it will.¬† Not like this is my first time going to the ER‚Ä¶. Hell, not even the first time for going in an ambulance after getting my nose broken and a concussion. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I‚Äôd have two nickels. Which isn‚Äôt a lot but it‚Äôs weird it‚Äôs happened twice‚Ä¶¬† I need a nap. Why is she crying like that while looking at me?¬† Pity?¬† Oh right, ugly gal with broken nose.¬† Poor girl. I hurt her so much. I need to touch her face, let her know I think I love‚Ä¶ a nap‚Ä¶Yea. I need a nap? Oh, a sedative in IV‚Ä¶ Nap time.*

¬†

More lights. Oh hey. I am laying on a bed. *This looks like an ER room. ¬†See enough of them and they all look the same.¬†¬† Jackie looks pissed and worried*.¬† There are pictures, no, X-rays? Yep, that‚Äôs my empty noggin. On the wall. The guy in the doctor‚Äôs coat is talking with Jackie. Wow. She is really worked up.¬† Thoughts are still a little‚Ä¶ yea.

‚ÄúYes, she suffered a pretty bad concussion when her head hit the corner of that table after he punched her jaw. Punches like that can knock out the toughest people, so I understand why she went down that hard. Her broken nose is set now.¬†¬†The hit was very hard. If he had hit her a few more times we wouldn‚Äôt be here. As I said before, we found some things that are‚Ä¶ concerning.‚Äú

Jackie seems terrified. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I listen.

‚ÄúI am not sure I can tell you now that she is conscious.‚Äù Guess he noticed?

‚ÄúLike hell you can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs impaired and I have medical power of attorney. We are both single women and we figured if one got hurt the other would be faster to contact than my out of state parents or her non-existent family.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, there are signs of abuse‚Ä¶ We would like to keep her for observation for the concussion.‚Äù

I finally pipe up. ‚ÄúWhy?¬†¬†Just stay hydrated, reduce screen time, no real activity for 2 days and then start light duty. Do some puzzles around the 2-day mark as well.‚Äù

The doctor looks at me.¬†¬†‚ÄúHad a few concussions before?‚Äù

‚ÄúLess than a dozen. Probably.¬† Okay, probably not.¬† More than enough to leave him.‚Äù¬† He seems to get it.

Jackie inhales sharply.¬† This is still new to her. Still fresh. It is ancient history for me.

The doctor nods. He must have seen the healed fracture lines on my jaw, skull and probably neck. I look at the x-ray. Ah, that‚Äôs what healing looks like.

‚ÄúIf we hadn‚Äôt had a report of it being caused by a patron that is currently in a coma in the ICU, I would have thought to report whoever was your partner. Although I don‚Äôt think it could be this young lady.¬† And those are some old scars though.¬† I see at least 3 jaw fractures, one that required wiring it shut to heal, yes?‚Äù

I nod.¬† Jackie keeps trying not to sob.¬† She fails.

‚ÄúHe cracked your C5.¬† Any higher or worse could have led to paralysis.¬† The orbital fractures were done over years‚Ä¶¬† I am certain if we x-rayed your arms and chest we would see multiple fractures that are healed.¬† And then there is also what looks like a sharp force wound that indicates the weapon went through both sides of your arm.¬† Positioning indicates a defensive wound; he was trying to kill you.‚Äù¬† Jackie inhales and is fighting the tears.¬† She looks so hurt. I want to hug her.

*I WILL FUCKING KILL HIM!!!¬† HE WILL BURN AND SCREAM AND BEG ME TO PEE ON HIM TO PUT IT OUT AND I WILL PEE ON HIM AND IT WILL NOT GO OUT!!!!¬† HE WILL BEG FOR A DEATH THAT WILL TAKE HOURS!!!*¬†

Oh boy I heard her broadcasting. Pretty sure it was her. She is seething. The doctor looks at her and gets a surprised look. I think he figured out she knew none of this.

I nod. ‚ÄúNone of that is wrong.¬† Wish I had you as a doc 7 years ago.¬† Might have left before the knife.¬† Can I go?‚Äù

He shakes his head. ‚ÄúI am still very worried about your pupil response.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have already advised me on proper aftercare for a concussion, technically.¬† I am using up a valuable spot for someone that truly needs it.¬† All those wounds are more than 6 years old, from a different state, and from a person I will never see again.¬† I got out.¬† I wish I had someone that would have pushed like you seem to want to. Really. You noticed things 4 hospitals either didn‚Äôt bother seeing or didn‚Äôt bother trying to stop.¬† Thank you.‚Äù

He shakes his head. ¬†He seems sad, and angry. Though that seems to ease his worries.¬† ‚ÄúI am going to let you check out. There are two police officers that want your statement.¬†¬†They got your girlfriend‚Äôs statement already.¬†

In unison ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt dating.‚Äù

He laughs and waves as he leaves.¬†Fucker blew that off.

Jackie gets my few things and helps me up. I ask, ‚ÄúWhat would I do without you?‚Äù¬†¬†*I am serious.*¬†

‚ÄúGet held for days to try and convince you to leave your abuser?‚Äù¬†¬†I look at her, puzzled.¬† ‚ÄúNot joking. They were going to use any excuse they could and see if they could find who did that.¬† I almost let them so I could go looking, but I realized I would just be driving around the south because I don‚Äôt know a thing about your past aside from Augusta Georgia within driving distance of some strip joints.‚Äù¬† The pain in her eyes hurts me.

‚ÄúBesides, I made the decision for you that you would want and was best for you. Even if I don‚Äôt want to make it.‚Äù

*I love this woman.*

‚ÄúIt okay if I lean on you to walk?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get enough?‚Äù Her smile is everything.

‚ÄúNever can, and I don‚Äôt want to fall while talking to the cops.‚Äù

She laughs. ‚ÄúLet me get a wheelchair. More stable.‚Äù

My police statement is simple. ‚ÄúTold the customers to knock off the fight, got sucker punched, blinding pain, heard commotion. Lights, confusion, EMTs.¬† Woke up here.‚Äù¬†

Apparently three of the guests jumped the puncher because they thought he was going to finish me off. The ‚Äúguy‚Äù he was fighting was the first to react and probably saved my life doing so.

The cops tell me that he looked pissed that I got in the way.¬† All his anger at the other guy got directed at me suddenly.¬†

The patrons didn‚Äôt kill him. But he will be less than happy living, that is if he ever wakes up out of the coma. I wonder who broke his neck.

The police thank me and watch me get wheeled away. I hear one whisper to the other ‚ÄúThat redhead has blood under her nails and the perp has looooong gashes on his face that look awfully similar.‚Äù¬†

His partner responds, ‚ÄúWitnesses say it was defensive because he went after the vic after she was down and then swung at the redhead when she tried to stop him. Let that one be, I heard from Simmons she told the EMT she would ‚Ä¶‚Äù The door closes before I find out what she was going to do.¬† Shame.¬† Of course she got a hit in.¬†

‚ÄúWhat did you tell the EMTs?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have power of attorney and was riding with you. They said no. I convinced them.‚Äù

I change my tone to annoyed mom, ‚ÄúJackie, what did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would burn Manhattan down starting with their station if they tried to take you from me.¬† The one guy looked at me and then you.¬† Then you piped up about free coffee and him saving me and he got like an ‚ÄòAHA!‚Äô moment and he said he‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt separate the miracle girl and her angel now that the roles of the couple are reversed,‚Äô and he told me to get in.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt laugh. I am pretty sure she would burn the city down for me. ¬†It scares me a little. I can sometimes see the flames all around her just when she is annoyed.¬† She would do it without a second thought.¬†

I debate going back to work.¬† No, probably not. But Jackie should be there.¬† ‚ÄúYou should be at work.¬† I can get home on my own.‚Äù¬† I am a little wobbly, but I can manage.¬† I get shot down immediately.

‚ÄúYou might have brain damage.¬† I called Lemar, he came in and I will cover for him the day after tomorrow.¬† He got someone to finish your shift as well. He needs a raise. Lucky, I don‚Äôt have a shift tomorrow, so I can nurse you in bed all day.¬† We are going home, I am sticking you in my bed, and you are resting.‚Äù

I would argue, but I really am tired and all that sounds nice.¬† ‚ÄúWhy your bed?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you will need lots of blankets for warmth and you sleep with like 1 sheet.¬† You will have a space heater that might actually manage to get to sleep tonight next to you because she is exhausted.¬† And, most importantly, my bedroom‚Äôs closer to the bathroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you really didn‚Äôt sleep last night?‚Äù¬† I am gently tossed into the back of a Taxi and Jackie gives the driver our address.

‚ÄúNot a wink.‚Äù¬†

I want to ask why not, but I am going to need to be unconscious for a little bit to be able to get in the apartment.¬† That wins out.¬†

¬†

**May 25**

I wake up in bed.¬† I am wearing my PJs and Jackie is laying next to me, asleep.¬† She looks so innocent.¬† The look lies. She‚Äôs wearing conservative PJs. I knew she has them.¬† I almost chuckle.¬† I need to pee.¬† Disentangling myself from her takes a short bit.¬† I stagger to the bathroom, do my business.¬† Wash my hands.¬† Puke.¬† Wow, hell of a concussion.¬† Only ever puked twice before from them.¬† The bruises on my face are a bright purple.¬† They also take up more than half my face.¬† No amount of make up is covering this.¬† I know from experience.

I clean up again and then get a pair of arms around me.¬† She is looking up at me.¬† ‚ÄúYou should shower.¬† I can start the water and get it ready for you.‚Äù

I am too exhausted to argue and just start stripping.¬† She does so as well.¬† I don‚Äôt quite get why until she is behind me and shivering like an idiot because 2 people in the shower is never actually sexy and always leaves someone cold.¬† She sits me down and that is a little better for her and for me.¬† She scrubs my back and gets me cleaned up.¬† She then helps me out and dries me off.¬† All business*.*

*I love this feeling of being pampered.*¬†

Fresh jammies and I am stuck in bed.¬† She leaves the room and comes back.¬† She makes me drink a couple of glasses of water. She changes into night wear of some sort.

*Why is she so good to me?* ¬†

I nod off as she gets into the bed with me.¬† She says I take care of her‚Ä¶

I wake up and there is a bowl of still warm soup next to me.¬† I gratefully eat it.¬† Stomach appears okay.¬† The door chime rings and Jackie can be heard going to the door.

Voices.¬† Loud.¬† One gets closer.¬† Oberon appears at the doorway.¬† *How the hell does he know where we live?*¬† Oh yea, he‚Äôs been here, damn I am out of it‚Ä¶¬† *I am wearing completely unsexy clothes.¬† Jackie is in a black nightie that should NOT be worn in front of him.¬† Oh lord are they going to break the bed?*¬† They would have to use my bed or kick me out of this one‚Ä¶ He walks up and touches my head.¬† He looks at the left side and I swear I hear a wolf snarling.¬† His hand is shaking.¬† I put my hand on his arm.¬† I think I know what he is about to do.¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù

He nods.¬† *Oh good, maybe instead of killing some guy he will calm down and be a good boy and take off his shirt so I can go to sleep and have nice dreams*?

He and Jackie share a look.¬† ‚ÄúDid I say that out loud?‚Äù¬† They both laugh.¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ask you, Patricia Rae Wallace, for permission to assist you‚Ä¶‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I can stop myself from saying yes, and I don‚Äôt want to anyway. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

He starts unbuttoning his shirt.

I don‚Äôt get to enjoy the view before I am asleep.¬† Concussions fucking suck.

The bed is cramped.¬† Wait, this is a queen, Jackie‚Äôs bed, why is it‚Ä¶¬† OHMYFUCKINGGOD!¬† ‚ÄúOBERON WHY ARE YOU IN BED WITH ME AND JACKIE?!?!!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was tired.¬† You were wonderful.‚Äù

‚ÄúPuck is the trickster, not you.¬† I know I didn‚Äôt do anything with you.‚Äù

He laughs.¬† ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am still alive and feel like I am able to walk.‚Äù¬†

He laughs at my words.¬† ‚ÄúGot me there.¬† Alright, ladies, I think she is beyond the worst.¬† I shall take my leave.¬† Jackie, if you ever decide to quit, call on me soon after.¬† Cindy complimented your skills and she was impressive herself.‚Äù

Jackie is 5 shades redder than she has any right to be.¬† It‚Äôs hilarious and gorgeous.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be the second, maybe third one I‚Äôd call.‚Äù

He laughs gets up, puts on a thong, and walks out, shirt over his shoulder.¬† Wait. He had to put it on‚Ä¶ things were bad enough for me without seeing him in a banana hammock.¬† Again.¬† Wow. And he just put it on meaning‚Ä¶

‚ÄúCare to explain‚Ä¶ this?‚Äù¬† I look at my best friend.

‚ÄúFae can heal people simply by skin-to-skin contact, remember? Titania did it for me.¬† While he was here checking on you, I mentioned he would probably vibe with you. You did ask him to take off his shirt‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† She looks over at me and the happiest smile I have ever seen on her.¬† Oberon will do that‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSkin to skin‚Ä¶?‚Äù¬† I check.¬† I am naked.¬†¬† Of course I am naked.¬† *Fucking Oberon*.¬† And now Jackie is snuggling up to me.¬† So warm.¬† So soft.¬† So naked.¬† So sweet.¬† Wait‚Ä¶

‚ÄúJackie, you do not have Fae healing powers, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why are you naked in this bed snuggling up to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúObie said it would help him.¬† It‚Äôs warm under the covers and you are soft.‚Äù¬† *All valid. Why do I feel like there‚Äôs more to it.*¬† It‚Äôs okay, she does make me feel better.¬† Speaking of, my head is fine.¬† I should be in the migraine phase and still wobbly right now.¬† I should also do some puzzles.

I grab my phone.¬† *She put it on the nightstand, sweet of her.*¬† I work in 4 hours.¬† Hold up, I have been in and out of consciousness for 2 days. I can manage it.¬† I pull up a sudoku and start working on it.¬† Jackie snuggles in more, half asleep, and I have to move a hand that is brushing up where it shouldn‚Äôt.¬† I finish the sudoku, decide I need to get moving and get up.¬† Move another hand where it shouldn‚Äôt be. Wait, that was there for a while and I kinda‚Ä¶ need to stop that thought.

Ugh, the air gets cold this early in the morning, even in late May. Little chilly, I stretch, hear a sigh from the bed, go to grab some clothes and get my hand smacked.¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck you think you are doing?‚Äù¬† Wow, she looks mad.¬†

I show her my phone.¬† ‚ÄúI have work in 3 hours.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd I have it in 2 for Lemar.¬† The difference is that I will be going to work and you are on bed rest until further notice.¬† I have Beth coming over in 30.¬† She is making sure you don‚Äôt do something stupid.¬† Lay down and rest.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam.‚Äù *So sweet.*

¬†

**May 29**

I get to work and I am greeted by May and Connie.¬† May is signing at 300 motions a second or something insane and I cannot keep up.¬† I sign for her to slow down because ‚ÄúI am sorry I am not quite this good.‚Äù¬† She gets a look and hugs me, crying.¬† She starts over, slowly.¬† ‚ÄúThe Hobgoblin is being held until you can go to Court.¬† There is a disagreement over which Court gets to punish him.‚Äù

I stagger a little there.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, I will see what I can do after work.¬† Thanks.‚Äù My signing has gotten to the point where most consider me fluent.¬† As I go to leave I see her sign to Connie, ‚ÄúDid you see her face?¬† I feel pain looking at it.‚Äù¬†

Connie responds with something that chills me far more.¬† ‚ÄúDid you see her arm?‚Äù¬† At that moment I realize that for the first time in ages, I am wearing short sleeves to work.

Fuck.¬† I just came in to sign some paperwork I can‚Äôt do electronically and because I was bored working at home.¬†

Jackie comes in for her shift and we will be going home together.¬† I see her staring at my arm.¬† I wonder if I have a jacket or long sleeve shirt in my office.¬† It won‚Äô matter, except it will remove the distraction.¬† I can feel her winding herself up as the day goes on. Even at home I wear long sleeves. This is why.

Oberon comes in.¬† Waves.¬† His smile is comically happy.¬† I have been working the drive thru to help and to avoid looks when it comes to my face.¬† I almost went for the kitchen.¬† When he gets in front of the counter Jackie comes and tells me he would like to talk to me specifically for a minute.¬† Walking up I just get it over with.¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù¬† He laugh and touches my cheek where it is still a little raw.¬†

‚ÄúI am only angry I could not stop it.‚Äù¬† I nod.¬† I know he is likely the reason the Summer Court is pushing to hold the Hobgoblin responsible as it would normally fall under Winter Court because it is an unseelie.

‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù¬† He grabs my left arm and examines the scar.¬† ‚ÄúThis is what I wanted to speak of with you.¬† I saw it while assisting you.¬† I have seen such a wound on a mortal that defended themselves from an attacker with a short stabbing sword.‚Äù¬†

I nod.¬† ‚ÄúGood eye, kitchen butcher‚Äôs knife. He got kicked in the nuts and I got away, obviously.‚Äù¬† He nods.¬† I can feel rage boiling up all around me.¬† I look around.¬† Jackie and Ron are both staring at me.¬† Jackie is still mad.¬† I can feel Ron being sad?¬† Angry?¬† Why?¬† I am just his boss.¬† Guess he is just a good guy. Nice. But this needs to stop.

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs stop this little melodrama.¬† My life is way different right now and I am not going to tell you all my tragic backstory while in the lobby of a coffee shop.¬† Back to work, people.‚Äù¬† I clap twice

Oberon grabs my hand. ‚ÄúYou are truly a warrior queen.¬† I will see you tonight?‚Äù¬† I nod.

Often I wake feeling stress, but I've always written it off to my body's own wake up chems which are stress chems such as cortisol and adrenaline. That feeling of stress brings on monkey-mind stress thoughts.

I don't make it a formal meditation session, so no timer. It is very grounding and seems to set me up for much more mindfullness during the day. 

I can see where some might not want to do this because of the risk of falling back asleep. In my case if I wake up drowzy and relaxed there is little impetus to do a meditation, so maybe I'll confine it to those times I wake with stress.

**Abstract Rugs and Carpets** have become a sought-after choice in home d√©cor, bringing a fresh and contemporary twist to traditional designs. With their bold patterns, vibrant colors, and dynamic designs, abstract rugs in India are taking over interior design trends, adding style, personality, and sophistication to any space.[**Abstract Carpet** ](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor)Whether it's a living room, bedroom, or study, these rugs effortlessly blend modern aesthetics with comfort and functionality. In this article, we will explore the appeal of abstract rugs in India, the diverse varieties available, their benefits, and how they can transform your living spaces.

# What Are Abstract Rugs?

An **abstract rug** is a rug that features non-representational or non-figurative designs. Unlike traditional rugs that often display floral patterns, geometric shapes, or scenes, abstract rugs prioritize artistic and experimental designs, often with a focus on color, texture, and form. These rugs are ideal for individuals seeking to add an artistic flair to their homes. With abstract rugs, the design is less about representing real-life objects and more about evoking emotions, creating moods, and adding depth to the space.

# The Rise of Abstract Rugs in India

Over the past decade, the popularity of abstract rugs has soared in India. Traditionally, Indian homes favored intricately woven carpets with detailed motifs and religious or cultural symbols. However, as global design influences seep into Indian interiors, homeowners are increasingly leaning towards contemporary and minimalist aesthetics. Abstract rugs offer a way to incorporate modern design without compromising on the rich tradition of craftsmanship.

India, with its vibrant culture, diverse artistic influences, and appreciation for fine craftsmanship, has seen a growing interest in abstract and modern rugs. From the bustling streets of Delhi to the serene coastal homes in Goa, abstract rugs have found a place in homes across the country, transforming interiors into art-filled spaces.

# The Appeal of Abstract Rugs in India

# . Versatility in Design

Abstract rugs are incredibly versatile in terms of design. Whether you are looking for bold and vibrant colors or subtle, muted tones, there is an abstract rug to suit every style. From circular and wave-like patterns to sharp, jagged lines and asymmetrical shapes, abstract rugs can create various moods depending on the space they are placed in.

For example, in a minimalist or modern space, a black-and-white abstract rug can create a striking focal point. In a more traditional room, a rug with splashes of red, orange, and gold can complement the existing d√©cor while introducing a contemporary touch.

# . Customization Options

A key advantage of abstract rugs is the ability to customize designs. Many rug manufacturers and designers offer made-to-order rugs where the size, shape, color, and design are tailored according to the buyer‚Äôs preferences. This level of customization allows homeowners to get a rug that perfectly complements their living space, creating a more personalized and cohesive interior design.

# . Elevating Aesthetic Appeal

Abstract rugs can instantly elevate the aesthetic appeal of a room. These rugs are typically designed to create a visual statement, drawing attention without overwhelming the space. The contrast of colors, the fluidity of patterns, and the play with textures bring dynamism into any room. Whether placed under a coffee table in the living room or at the foot of a bed, these rugs enhance the overall atmosphere and tie together the entire room.

# . Comfort and Functionality

Beyond their visual appeal, abstract rugs also provide comfort and functionality. They offer a soft surface for walking, sitting, and playing, which is particularly beneficial for families with young children. The addition of a rug can help to define different areas within a room, especially in open-concept spaces. Rugs can also contribute to better acoustics by reducing sound echo, making a room feel warmer and cozier.

# . Durability and Easy Maintenance

When buying an abstract rug, especially online in India, durability and maintenance are important considerations. While traditional rugs might require more delicate care, modern abstract rugs, especially those made from synthetic fibers, are often more durable and easier to clean. These rugs can handle heavy foot traffic and are ideal for homes with children and pets.

# Types of Abstract Rugs in India

Abstract rugs come in a variety of materials, designs, and styles. Let‚Äôs look at some popular options available online in India:

# . Wool Abstract Rugs

Wool is a natural fiber known for its softness, warmth, and durability. Wool abstract rugs are some of the most luxurious types of rugs available. These rugs have a rich texture that adds a touch of sophistication to any room. Whether you‚Äôre looking for bold, geometric patterns or a more organic, flowing design, wool abstract rugs provide a timeless appeal. Wool is also stain-resistant, making these rugs a practical choice for high-traffic areas.

# ¬†. Cotton Abstract Rugs

Cotton rugs are soft, breathable, and often more affordable than their wool counterparts. They come in a range of colors and designs, including those with abstract patterns. Cotton abstract rugs are particularly popular in modern homes because they are lightweight and easy to move around. They are also machine-washable, making them ideal for spaces that need frequent cleaning, like kitchens or children‚Äôs playrooms.

# ¬†. Silk Abstract Rugs

For an added layer of luxury, silk abstract rugs offer a shimmering finish that enhances the overall aesthetic of the room. The reflective quality of silk enhances the vibrancy of the rug‚Äôs colors, making them stand out even more. These rugs are often used as statement pieces in living rooms or areas where they can be showcased as a work of art. However, silk rugs tend to be more delicate, so they require careful handling and regular cleaning.

# ¬†. Polyester and Nylon Abstract Rugs

Synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon have become increasingly popular due to their durability, stain resistance, and ease of cleaning. These rugs are affordable, making them an excellent choice for budget-conscious buyers.[**Abstract Rugs Online India**](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor)**.** While they may lack the luxurious feel of natural fibers, synthetic abstract rugs often have intricate patterns and vibrant colors that can mimic the appearance of traditional wool or silk rugs. Polyester and nylon rugs are perfect for high-traffic areas or homes with pets.

# ¬†. Jute and Hemp Abstract Rugs

For a more eco-friendly option, jute and hemp abstract rugs offer a rustic, earthy aesthetic. The natural fibers used in these rugs provide a unique texture, and their neutral tones complement a variety of modern d√©cor styles. These rugs are sustainable, biodegradable, and offer a natural charm to any home.

# Where to Buy Abstract Rugs Online in India?

With the rise of online shopping, purchasing abstract rugs in India has never been easier. Several platforms offer a wide range of options, allowing customers to browse through various designs, materials, and sizes. Some popular online stores include:

* **Amazon India**: Amazon offers a vast selection of abstract rugs, ranging from affordable synthetic options to premium wool and silk designs.

# Choosing the Right Abstract Rug for Your Space

When selecting an abstract rug for your home, there are several factors to consider to ensure you get the perfect piece:

# ¬†. Size

The size of the rug should be proportionate to the space in which it will be placed. In living rooms, choose a rug that is large enough to cover the seating area but doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the space. In bedrooms, a smaller rug placed near the bed can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

# ¬†. Color Palette

Choose a rug color that complements the overall color scheme of the room. Bold and contrasting colors can create a focal point, while muted tones can help to blend the rug into the background. Neutral colors like beige, grey, and white work well in minimalist rooms, while vibrant hues like red, blue, or yellow can energize the space.

# ¬†. Material

Consider the material of the rug based on the level of foot traffic in the area. Wool and silk rugs are perfect for living rooms or areas with less foot traffic, while cotton, polyester, and jute are more suitable for kitchens, hallways, or children's rooms.

# ¬†. Maintenance

Abstract rugs made from synthetic fibers or natural fibers like jute are generally easier to maintain. If you prefer a low-maintenance option, go for synthetic fibers or cotton, which are machine washable.

# Conclusion

Abstract rugs are a fantastic way to bring modern design and creative energy into your Indian home. Whether you‚Äôre looking for something bold and colorful or subtle and sophisticated, there is an abstract rug for every style and space[.**Abstract Rugs**](https://rugslane.com/blogs/insights/how-to-choose-the-perfect-abstract-rugs-for-your-home-decor) By investing in an abstract rug, you not only enhance the visual appeal of your home but also add warmth, comfort, and functionality.

	‚Ä¢	Jennifer: Super sweet person, but honestly just okay as a cook. Very inconsistent. I have no idea how she made it to the finale, she made so many mistakes, like serving raw lamb.

	‚Ä¢	Adrian: Also inconsistent. That coffee nut - based challenge really exposed his weaknesses.

	‚Ä¢	Christian: Cocky, arrogant, and just plain rude. No respect for the other contestants. He only knew how to cook fish and was a terrible team captain. Kudos to Jennifer for calling him out and that moment when Joe lost it on him? Iconic!!! :) So glad he didn‚Äôt win; he should‚Äôve been eliminated much earlier.

	‚Ä¢	Suzy: Technically skilled, but always overcomplicated her dishes. And the constant sucking up to the judges? So annoying. She couldn‚Äôt handle any criticism either and got upset every time they didn‚Äôt praise her average dishes.

	‚Ä¢	Christine: My least favorite. All she did was complain and drink wine. Rarely said anything kind to anyone. Her food was unremarkable, and she always seemed to just throw things together last minute with no plan.

	‚Ä¢Ben Starr: Total sweetheart and a genuinely good cook. I was rooting for him to make the finals with Alejandra. A joy to watch!

	‚Ä¢	Esther: Okay overall. I don‚Äôt blame her for saving herself in pressure tests, but she didn‚Äôt do anything memorable either. Pretty forgettable.

	‚Ä¢	Max: He was only 18, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting maturity but he came across as a spoiled rich kid. Talented, yes, but far too cocky and arrogant for me to enjoy watching.

	‚Ä¢	Tracy: Solid cook, but didn‚Äôt leave much of an impression.

	‚Ä¢	Derrick: Underrated. He was good and had potential to go much further.

	‚Ä¢	Alvin: Don‚Äôt get why the judges hyped him up so much and he was just okay. Nothing wow-worthy.

	‚Ä¢	Alejandra: One of my absolute favorites. Confident, composed, and consistently strong. I really wish she had made the finals with Ben. It was disappointing to see her go home over Suzy but though to be fair, she did serve raw pork üò¨",0,1752839122.0,Masterchef,1,0.25,False

*I saw some comments mentioning the law, so I‚Äôve deleted the photos. If anyone wants to see it, feel free to message me.*

Today in Samut Sakhon, I experienced something I never expected while volunteering at a school. My friend and I are Myanmar Master‚Äôs students, spending our semester break doing volunteer work. During lunch, we stopped by Everyday 1990 Cafe for coffee, then waited for our Grab motorbike at a junction nearby to go back to the school.

Out of nowhere, the man in a white shirt in the photos came up and started shouting at us and told us to sit down. We didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We tried to ask them to explain using Google Translate. He pushed me hard, shouted again, and asked, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

My friend panicked, showed her student card, and said we are Myanmar students from this university. As soon as they heard ‚ÄúMyanmar,‚Äù things got worse. They started shouting Thai phrases including ‚ÄúMyanmar.‚Äù We didn‚Äôt fully understand, but we could feel the racism clearly.

More and more people gathered. Around 20 people, taking photos of our faces, filming our student cards, even doing Facebook Live. But when we tried to record them back, they wouldn‚Äôt let us. We kept asking through Google Translate what the problem was. They didn‚Äôt answer and just kept shouting. Then, a local girl nearby finally told us there had been a theft at the small juice shop in front of us. They thought we were involved. (P.S. We didn‚Äôt even walk past that shop!)

Even when I tried to ask again, the white tshirt man pushed me again and this time, he even tried to punch me‚ÄºÔ∏è It was just the two of us, surrounded by a crowd of around 20 people. We chose to stay calm and called our professor at the school, who is French. 

While waiting, I saw them hit another person inside the juice shop. That‚Äôs when I realized they already caught the real thief yet they still didn‚Äôt care about what they did to us.

When our professor arrived, the moment they saw he is a foreigner, everything changed. The same people who had shouted and pushed us suddenly apologized but only to him. Not a single word to us.

Honestly, it was painful. We were treated like criminals just because we are Myanmar.

I really wanted to call the police, but we had to return to the school to finish our tasks and didn‚Äôt want to make things bigger. I just wanted to share this here, so people know racism like this is real and getting worse in Thailand.

This is the location where everything happened.

What if you can‚Äôt find a decent job‚Ä¶

You get out of school and go to uni, work in an outbound call centre to make some money, it‚Äôs the only terrible place that will take anyone.

So I'm here to explain- 

The idea of OS is to be sexy in office wear. Think 50 Shades of Grey, The Secretary, etc. It's mainly a fantasy and plays into (usually) the male fantasy of dominating one of two working archetypes- the 'strong working woman' (female lawyer for example) or the 'sexy assistant/receptionist'. For example, Oliva Benson is considered an office siren because she's hot and wears 'OS' clothing and she fits into the 'strong independent working woman' trope.  

The OS glasses seems to stem from Bayonetta and, ironically, Jo Frost from Supernanny (a british tv show about a nanny). The Bayonetta aspect comes from the fact that she's very conventionally attractive and wears the smaller framed glasses and Jo Frost because she wears office wear and looks good (dresses for her body) whilst also being professional. 

The OS trend got big during the pandemic where people were working from home but wanted to dress up and look 'nice' as a way of forcing themselves out of their pjs for working from home. It then became bastardised and a tiktok trend where people started wearing tight leather and more revealing clothing whilst not actually going to work. I've also seen it being called 'assistant core'- basically wearing OS clothing out to get coffee.

1m302j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1m302j9/paper_wasps/,Paper Wasps,"It started off with a cry every parent has heard a hundred times before.

‚ÄúDaaad! There‚Äôs someone in my room!‚Äù

It was one AM, maybe 2 AM? There was certainly not anyone in Des‚Äôs room. The house was locked, his bedroom was on the second story. But I went to look anyway, because even though obviously there was no one there, obviously it was a nightmare‚Äîwhat if it wasn‚Äôt?

That‚Äôs the real nightmare for every parent. What if this one time your child was screaming and you didn‚Äôt hurry over, but it turned out to finally be important? There are always stories of accidents and abductions. All the logic in the world wouldn‚Äôt fix the guilt if something was truly wrong and you didn‚Äôt go check.

So I hauled myself out of bed, waving my wife Petra back to sleep. I stumbled down the hall in my pajama bottoms and swung Des‚Äôs door open. The hallway light fell on his bed, where he was huddled under the covers.

‚ÄúDude. What?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt at my most articulate.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the corner! A giant!‚Äù

I turned to look. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs noth‚Äîholy chemise!‚Äù

Parental reflexes are funny things. In about a half a second, the situation unfolded like this: first, I saw a huge, swollen face leering down from me from the corner of the room, just like Des had said. Second, I ran‚Äînot for the hallway, but for the bed, where I grabbed Desmond in a giant fabric bundle. Only then did I sprint for the hallway.

And third, I somehow corrected myself from swearing in the middle of that, so that my seven year old wouldn‚Äôt learn a word that he‚Äôd probably already heard at school. And had *definitely* already heard from my brother.

The blankets in my arms were screaming.

‚ÄúDaddy! It‚Äôs got me! Help meee!‚Äù

I‚Äôd like to say that I said something comforting or smart, but apparently I‚Äôd burned through my store of good parental choices in that first maneuver. Instead, I rolled the entire bundle as far down the hallway toward my room as I could and barked, ‚ÄúGo get your mother!‚Äù

I had no weapon. I didn‚Äôt even have a shirt on. I was going to have to face this thing alone.

I took a deep breath and kicked the door all the way open.

‚ÄúAll right, creep‚Äî‚Äù

Only there wasn‚Äôt a creep. As the door slammed back into the wall, the light fully illuminated the corner of the room. There was nobody in the corner, literally no body. What I had thought was a head was a large papery mass stuck up against the ceiling, an oblong maybe a foot across and almost two feet long.

I let out a short laugh as I realized how silly I‚Äôd been. In the light, it didn‚Äôt look anything like a person. It was probably just‚Äî

All the adrenaline flooded back in. I grabbed the door handle and yanked it shut. I heard it tear free from where it had smashed through the drywall, and splinter as I slammed it into its frame. I staggered back against the far wall.

‚ÄúWhat? What is it?‚Äù My wife was at the end of the hall, untangling our son from his involuntary cocoon. She looked as panicked as I felt.

‚ÄúGive me those blankets!‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúWasp nest!‚Äù

She blinked in confusion, but at least she lifted Desmond out of the way as I grabbed frantically for his comforter and stuffed it against the crack beneath his bedroom door.

‚ÄúWhat? How?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù My adrenaline crashed for a second time in a single minute. I suddenly felt lightheaded, like I might pass out. The blankets were in place. The door was sealed. As long as I didn‚Äôt fall into it and knock it open, it would be okay. ‚ÄúOpen window, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs December!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to argue. ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll figure it out tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about Desi?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gonna have to sleep with us. I‚Äôm not fighting wasps in the middle of the night.‚Äù I steadied myself with a hand on the wall as I walked back down the hallway. ‚ÄúBabe, you should‚Äôve seen this thing. Twice the size of my head, taking up half the wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe more,‚Äù said Des.

Petra looked at both of us skeptically. ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll see in the morning, I guess. Come on, everybody into bed.‚Äù

As I laid back down, I wondered if Petra was right not to believe us. That nest certainly hadn‚Äôt been there when I put Des to bed last night. Were wasps even active at night?

My last thought before I fell asleep was that if they were, we‚Äôd better hope that they didn‚Äôt realize my barrier under the door was only cloth.

I dreamed of wings and stingers. When my phone alarm went off in the morning, I flinched awake at the very first buzz. I crept cautiously into the hallway, ready to retreat, but the blanket was still tucked against Des‚Äôs door and there were no wasps to be seen.

I peeled a corner of the blanket away and crouched down to listen carefully beneath the door. The room was silent. A hive that size would have some sort of noise if it were active, surely. If the wasps were all out foraging or whatever wasps did, it might be safe to knock the nest down and seal up whatever window or vent had allowed them inside.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

I jumped in surprise, with enough force to crack my head on the door. The hollow thunk elicited a laugh from my wife, who had apparently also woken up and was now standing above me, amused at the reaction to her simple question.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to decide if it‚Äôs safe to go in there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo we have any sort of full body suit? Like a beekeeper getup?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it can‚Äôt be that bad,‚Äù said Petra. She reached over me and before I could stop her, she swung the door open.

I heard her gasp and I scrambled to my feet, scrabbling to slam the door .

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs fine, there‚Äôs no wasps!‚Äù said Petra, grabbing my wrists. Her eyes were fixed on the far wall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like that nest, though. Wow!‚Äù

It was somehow more ominous in the daytime. It still gave the vague impression of a face, a papier mache death mask for a giant. Its rough construction was more obvious now. The imperfections made it more threatening. It did not look like art. It looked like a curse.

As Petra had said, there were no wasps anywhere to be seen. That at least was a relief.

‚ÄúHow do you think they made it so quickly?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúAll I care about is how quickly I can get rid of it,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking fire might be necessary.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Absolutely not. Be careful when you take it down.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can repaint! It‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried about the walls! I want that nest.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy! I‚Äôm not risking my life because you want some creepy bug house.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, then I‚Äôll get it down.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I heaved a sigh as Petra stared me down challengingly. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîhang out for a few minutes. We have a bug bomb in the garage, I think.‚Äù

Several minutes of fruitless searching let me know that we did not have a bug bomb in the garage. I came back to let Petra know the bad news.

‚ÄúBabe, I‚Äôm gonna have to‚Äîwhat are you doing?!‚Äù

She was coming out of the doorway of Des‚Äôs room, the hideous nest cradled in her arms. She gave me a look that was half guilty, half triumphant.

‚ÄúI got it down. It was empty!‚Äù She gave it a little shake to prove this.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs pretty lucky, isn‚Äôt it? You know what could have happened if you‚Äôd been swarmed by that many wasps?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt have thrown that poison in there anyway. All of Des‚Äôs stuff is in there. All of his toys would have had to be thrown out. Anyway, look at this!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd really rather not.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, look what it‚Äôs made out of! It‚Äôs got newsprint in it! Look, you can read words!‚Äù

She was right. The nest was covered in printed type and bits of black-and-white pictures. The words were stuck on at all sorts of angles, little scraps glued together with no rhyme or reason. There were columns and headline fragments jammed over top of each other.

‚ÄúGreat, so we‚Äôve got literate wasps. I‚Äôll put up a sign that says NO TRESPASSING so they don‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you don‚Äôt think this is amazing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we need to get Des ready for school before I have to go to work, and I want to find how those things got in before they come back.‚Äù

Petra gave me a brief pout, but she put the nest aside and went back to our room to wake Desmond up. For my part, I checked the windows and vents in his room, but could find no sign that anything was open to the outside. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable leaving it at that, but I didn‚Äôt have time for a more thorough search around the exterior of the house. I made a plan to check after work, and if I still couldn‚Äôt find anything, we could just seal up his room again until we had time to call an exterminator.

All of the extra activity put me slightly behind schedule, so I wasn‚Äôt happy to enter the kitchen and hear Des arguing about whether or not he had to eat breakfast.

‚ÄúYou gotta eat something, bud,‚Äù I told him, pouring myself a mug of coffee. ‚ÄúCome on, we‚Äôre gonna be late.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to!‚Äù he complained. I sighed and grabbed a breakfast bar to feed him in the car. It would be better than nothing.

I thought he ate it on the way to school, but after I dropped him off, I saw it sliding around the back seat of the car, still wrapped. He must have hidden it under his car seat. Kids can find the most amazing ways to cause problems for themselves.

It wasn‚Äôt a total surprise when I got a call from the school to come pick him up around lunchtime. Between the sleep interruption and skipping breakfast, I‚Äôd have been more surprised if he had made it through the school day. They said he had a slight fever, but mainly he just wanted to lie down. I made my excuses to my boss and ducked out to go retrieve Des.

‚ÄúRough day?‚Äù I asked him as we walked from the nurse‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel very good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs why you need to eat breakfast like your mom was telling you this morning. That breakfast bar‚Äôs still in the car if you want it now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it. I want a nap.‚Äù

I thought about the unsolved problem of the wasps. ‚ÄúHey, how about we put you in mommy and daddy‚Äôs bed for that nap?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I want my room.‚Äù He looked uncharacteristically on the verge of a tantrum, so I let it drop. I figured there was a decent chance he‚Äôd be asleep by the time we got back anyway, and if he wasn‚Äôt, we could have that argument then.

Unfortunately, Des was still awake when we pulled into the garage. I was mentally gearing up for a fight with a tired seven year old when we walked into the kitchen and I totally lost my train of thought.

Petra was sitting at the table. The wasp nest was in a large bowl next to her, glistening wet. It looked more like a leering face than ever.

‚ÄúLook!‚Äù said Petra.

Scraps of wet paper covered the kitchen table. It looked like a jigsaw puzzle made out of trash.

‚ÄúHave you been‚Ä¶peeling that nest?‚Äù

Behind me, Des dropped his book bag on the floor and trundled off to his room to lie down. Neither of us noticed him go.

‚ÄúLook at this! It‚Äôs a newspaper,‚Äù said Petra.

‚ÄúYeah, you said that this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut look at the date!‚Äù

She had found a piece of the header. It had today‚Äôs date on it.

‚ÄúSo? We found it toda‚Äîwait, how early do they deliver the papers? That thing was fully formed by like 2 AM.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt today‚Äôs date. It‚Äôs TOMORROW‚ÄôS.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I lost interest. ‚ÄúFrom like last year? So they just got into some old papers somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt says the right day of the week,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúSo unless that paper is like thirty years old, it‚Äôs from tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make any sen‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got part of the sports page. Are these two teams playing tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, bu‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd look, here‚Äôs half a paragraph about a town council meeting. I looked it up. It‚Äôs happening this afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äîit can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù I sputtered, looking for words. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what it means.‚Äù Petra pointed to a specific cluster of newsprint, her eyes shining. ‚ÄúIt means we‚Äôre going to be rich.‚Äù

The paper was crumpled, torn in inconvenient places and translucent from the water. Still, the header was clear enough: POWERBALL.

Below, assembled from various scraps, were four two-digit numbers.

‚ÄúThe other two are in here somewhere,‚Äù Petra said. ‚ÄúAll we have to do is find them. Hundreds of millions of dollars. But we have to do it today.‚Äù

It was crazy. It made no sense.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this,‚Äù I told her.

‚ÄúThought you might say that. Here, look at this one.‚Äù

It was a larger scrap, a nearly complete paragraph describing a hit-and-run on a pedestrian. It listed the intersection and the time.

‚ÄúHasn‚Äôt happened yet, right?‚Äù said Petra. ‚ÄúGo see. You‚Äôll see that I‚Äôm right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nuts,‚Äù I said, but I went.

As I approached the intersection, I kept my eyes peeled. I still didn‚Äôt believe Petra, but if somehow she was right, I knew how this stuff worked in movies. I‚Äôd be the guy who caused the hit and run. Or the pedestrian who got hit. Either way, it would only have happened because I‚Äôd seen the prediction. I wasn‚Äôt interested in getting involved in any time loop shenanigans.

I parked carefully. I turned off my car. I stayed inside.

It wasn‚Äôt a busy intersection, but every time someone crossed the road, I tensed up. Was this it? Each time they crossed safely, I let out the breath I‚Äôd been holding, and then checked my watch. The minutes were creeping by. It was always too early.

I was checking my watch again, certain that the time had passed without incident, when I suddenly heard squealing brakes and a hard crunch. I leapt out of my car to see a person crumpled against the side of a parked car and a green Nissan speeding off. I should have paid attention to the license plate, but I was too shocked by the fact that the accident had happened at all. It was exactly as the newspaper fragment had described.

People were already running over to help. No one needed me there. I was afraid of getting involved, of changing anything. My hands were shaking as I started the car. Petra was right. Somewhere in the layers of that nest were the other two numbers. More than half a billion dollars, and all we had to do was uncover it.

I had to get home to help. We had less than eight hours until the entries closed.

I burst back into the house with a breathless, ‚ÄúHave you found any more?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it happened, huh? Believe me now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I pulled up a chair next to her. ‚ÄúIntangible wasps built a nest in our son‚Äôs room using a paper that hasn‚Äôt been printed yet. And somehow I believe that. Did you find any more of the numbers?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet. I was thinking though, even if we can‚Äôt find any more, that‚Äôs only like five thousand options for the two we don‚Äôt know. We could buy one of each to make sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly five thousand? That‚Äôs ten thousand dollars. We don‚Äôt have that on hand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can figure it out!‚Äù Her eyes blazed as she looked at me. ‚ÄúWe can borrow it at 100% interest per day and still come out so far ahead that we‚Äôll never even notice it. I‚Äôm not saying I want to. There are probably systems in place that flag that sort of buying behavior. But if it comes down to it, we‚Äôll risk it.‚Äù

She was right, of course. Still, it would be much better if we could just find those other numbers.

‚ÄúOkay, how do I peel pieces off of this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLet me do it, I‚Äôve got nails. You sort through the pieces over there. Make sure you check both sides.‚Äù

We rapidly fell into a rhythm. She gently bathed the nest in warm water, loosening the scraps that had been used to make it, then teased off the individual scraps to pass to me. I checked them over for numbers, discarding anything that was just words or pictures. The numbers got set aside to dry, waiting for Petra to check through them while the next level of scraps was slowly soaking free of the nest.

I heard Des call out for me at one point, but as I rose from the table to see how he was doing, a scrap caught my eye. It had a partial circle near the top with the bottom part of a W. Below it, at the bottom of the fragment, was the number 39.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù Des called again.

‚ÄúBe right there, bud,‚Äù I said. I moved the scrap slowly toward the others, as if I thought sudden movements might scare the numbers away. The circled W at the top fit into the Powerball logo. The number at the bottom was one of the two we were missing.

‚ÄúGot one!‚Äù I shouted. Petra threw her arms around me in a wet hug. Small pieces of newsprint clung to her nails. I hugged her back, but I watched those scraps anxiously. If any fell on the floor, I wanted to know where they had gone.

Hours passed. The nest shrank and shrank. It no longer resembled a head. Now it looked like a misshapen heart. I could hear how hollow it was under Petra‚Äôs gentle handling. We were getting close to the final layers.

‚ÄúWhat if there are eggs in there?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOr larva, or whatever wasps have. What if we open it up and there‚Äôs a queen?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think wasps have queens.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like that‚Äôs the part of this that doesn‚Äôt make sense! What if there‚Äôs something horrible in the center and we let it out?‚Äù

As I said that, one of Petra‚Äôs nails pierced the final layer. She jerked her hand back and tore away a thick strip of newsprint with it. I flinched back instinctively, but although the internal cavity was large enough for a small dog, it was completely empty. There was nothing at all inside.

Petra let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúWell! Answered that question, I guess.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt listening to her anymore. My gaze was fixed on the piece of paper dangling from her hand. It bore the circled P of Powerball. If it was a large enough scrap, it might have the final number at the bottom. I couldn‚Äôt see the number on it, but it looked like it might be big enough.

‚ÄúGive me your hand,‚Äù I said. Petra watched as I peeled the wet newsprint away like sunburnt skin. I put it on the table almost reverently.

‚ÄúIs that it?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all six,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTonight‚Äôs Powerball numbers. That‚Äôs all of them.‚Äù

We stared at them for a moment. I felt a mix of awe and fear. This didn‚Äôt feel real. I‚Äôd seen the accident, though. This was future information. This was going to change everything.

‚ÄúWe have to go buy a ticket,‚Äù Petra whispered. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only a couple of hours left.‚Äù

We both went. I think we both had the feeling that if we let the other one out of our sight, the whole impossible idea might collapse. We checked the numbers a dozen times as we put them into the machine. Two dollars was such an insanely small amount to exchange for a slip of paper that was going to be worth so much.

I half-expected the nest to be gone when we got home, but it was still there, torn apart and spread all over our kitchen table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better clean this up if you want to have dinner,‚Äù Petra said. Her mouth suddenly opened into an O of shock. ‚ÄúDesmond! Poor baby hasn‚Äôt eaten anything all day, and we let him sleep through dinner!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go see if he wants anything,‚Äù I said. I shuffled down the hall and knocked gently on his door. ‚ÄúDes? Buddy? You awake?‚Äù

There was no answer, though I did hear a quiet drone like a sustained snore.

I eased the door open. The light fell across the bed.

Desmond‚Äôs eyes were closed. His mouth was hanging open. The purple sheets were bunched up over his body and moving strangely, as if he was running his hands up and down underneath.

*Des‚Äôs sheets are blue*, I thought. My mind would go no further, though I already knew the truth. I could see where the sheets were blue at the bottom, could see where the purple was thickest and shining its true red in the light from the hallway.

I stepped robotically inside the room. Desmond did not move. The sheets continue to writhe and pulse.

I reached down. I took hold of a corner. I pulled them aside.

Wasps. Thousands, tens of thousands. They flew up in a cloud, boiling out of the red ruin of Des‚Äôs belly. Their wingbeats droned frantically as they escaped the confines of the blankets and flew‚Äîneither at me nor away, but rather, away from everything. They grew smaller and smaller, disappearing down a long hallway without changing position at all.

I heard Petra scream behind me as the last of the wasps vanished. I saw the Powerball ticket fall from her hand as she rushed across the floor to the torn and chewed body of our son. I heard her sobs, great racking cries of loss and guilt.

I looked at the blood on my hands. I looked at the ticket on the floor. The numbers would be valid, I knew. Just as I knew that tomorrow‚Äôs newspaper would be chewed to pieces to make a nest.

I intended to keep that newspaper as close to me as possible. Whenever the wasps came for it, however they arrived, I would kill as many of them as I could.

I couldn‚Äôt change anything. The Powerball numbers would win. But the wasp nest had been hollow.

Maybe I would be able to deny them something.

It was 2am. I was halfway through a bag of stale chips, staring at a blank Google Doc titled: ‚ÄúImpact of globalization on local economies.‚Äù The only thing globalizing at that moment was my anxiety.

Desperate, I typed ‚Äúbest paper writing services reddit‚Äù into the search bar ‚Äî and somehow, I landed on[ EssayEagle.net](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252). I‚Äôd never heard of it before. No big-budget ads. No spammy pop-ups. Just a clean site and some decent-looking reviews.

I figured, if it crashes and burns, at least I‚Äôll go down trying.

Spoiler: it didn‚Äôt.

# ü¶Ö EssayEagle.net ‚Äî First Impressions

The site layout? Surprisingly slick. Not 2005-web-forum vibes like half the so-called [top rated essay writing services](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) out there. It‚Äôs minimal, direct, and doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúscam‚Äù at first glance ‚Äî always a good sign.

Ordering was easy:

* I chose the essay type (6 pages, argumentative, due in 48 hours).
* Entered the topic + some chaotic notes I‚Äôd been avoiding for a week.
* Picked a writer level (went with ‚Äúpremium‚Äù because I was not in the mood for surprises).
* Paid with card. No hidden fees. No shady redirects.  

# Delivery & Quality

The paper arrived 6 hours before the deadline ‚Äî flex. Formatting? Spot on (APA done right, which is rare). Language? Polished, but not suspiciously perfect ‚Äî like something I might write on 3 cups of coffee and 4 hours of sleep.

There was a solid structure, legit sources (I checked), and the writer actually made a coherent argument. Wild, I know.

I even asked for one small revision (I‚Äôd forgotten to mention a source), and they got it back to me in under 3 hours. Respect.

**Why It Stands Out**

Here‚Äôs what makes EssayEagle sneak into my top 10 essay writing services list:

* **Real communication**: You can chat with the writer. Mine asked if I had sample papers to match tone. That‚Äôs next-level.
* **Originality report included**: No upcharge for basic honesty. Cool.
* **Flexible pricing**: You can go budget or premium depending on your panic level.
* **It doesn‚Äôt pretend to be a university.** Just does the job, cleanly.

If we‚Äôre talking best college paper writing services, this one feels built by people who actually remember what finals week feels like.

# Any Red Flags?

Not many, honestly ‚Äî but for transparency:

* Not as well-known as big names like SpeedyPaper or EssayMarker, so fewer external reviews (yet).
* Support is fast but text-based only ‚Äî no phone option if you‚Äôre into that.  

Still, as far as [the best writing service](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) candidates go, I‚Äôve had worse experiences with way flashier sites.

# Who‚Äôs It For?

* You‚Äôre buried under 3 assignments and 2 group projects.  
* You want solid, plagiarism-free work but don‚Äôt want to sell a kidney.  
* You appreciate speed, structure, and sanity.  

Whether you're a tired undergrad or a grad student just trying to survive, EssayEagle fits in with the more reliable options among the top essay writing services.

# Is [EssayEagle.net](https://essayeagle.net/?utm_source=posttest&utm_medium=252) the best essay writing service in existence? Maybe not.

But is it dependable, clean, and better than half the overpriced sites Reddit keeps dragging? 100%.

It‚Äôs definitely earned a spot on my ‚ÄúWould Use Again‚Äù list.

Glorsku General:

Comrades and comrades!

I stand here before you as the commander of the Portal Star project, established right here in liberated Glorsku - in a country that only a few months ago was bleeding under the boot of Nazi oppression.

This place, where we now gather, was recently shaken by artillery fire during the Prague offensive. Well today - today we are here as free people. Not as victors over one regime, but as pioneers of a new era, an era of revolutionary science and socialist progress.

If the Nazi command had claimed authority over Lieutenant Bia≈Çyslaw Pa≈Ñtwosky, make no doubt about it - their Gestapo would have dragged Captains GG-02 and GG-03 into my command room. And in the worst case - it also executed them. But our men would face death without hesitation - because we are revolutionaries, not slaves!

Today we face a new threat. Not with a swastika, but with a dark force from beyond the stars.

Bram's weapon‚Äîthat diabolical machine that creates portal passages between worlds‚Äîis a tool that can fall into the wrong hands. But know that an electromagnetic pulse, properly directed, can stop its entire course. Just as one single person can stand in the way of evil.

We have to learn from it. Comrades! We can resist. Not just alien invaders. Not just imperialist capitalism. But also despair, betrayal, indifference! And if we meet fascists, Americans, or capitalists in need - we will help them. Not because of them, but because of humanity itself. Because a true revolutionary knows that a person is more than an ideology.

Revolution does not spread by force, comrades. We don't need tanks to spread the truth. Our enemies - not excluding the Americans - may tempt the world, but they do not offer it a soul.

We are not fighting for conquest! We fear for the future! We are fighting for a revolution. For socialism. For the stars.

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!!





1951, a calm sky stretches overhead, with large clouds drifting swiftly across the sunlit day above a military base. And, Autumn forest turns from green to yellow like a lime color. Around its perimeter, protesters begin to gather. The bunker door starts to seal shut, guarded firmly by the entire army standing its ground. In the air‚Äîtense peace.

The protesters wave old Glorsku flags and chant slogans from before the Communist coup. Some shout for freedom. Others cry for bread.

Suddenly, the gate explodes. The crowd surges forward. Protesters breach the base.

‚ÄúThey're anti-communist.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike fascist or capitalist?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. The resistance movement is crucial for keeping our nation united‚Äînot to ignite a civil war between Czechs and Slovaks, nor to stage some revolutionary overthrow. We need to stop waging wars with other nations. We should be learning from the mistakes of the Interwar period.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey will come down under a united cause. And no‚Äîkilling in its name will only end in bloodshed‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral, you need help‚Äîtanks, planes, something.‚Äù

A few days in the future, ‚ÄúTanya! We need you for the project. We‚Äôll protect you‚Äîfor the sake of your family‚Äôs future. I understand how much your family meant to you‚Ä¶ how your mother‚Äôs birth was like the right hand of your core. You‚Äôre my aunt, Tanya. Not by blood alone, but by the oath of loyalty that binds us.‚Äù

‚ÄúErich Ivanov Serebryakov-Kozzacko... You are Rusyn, born of your mother‚Äôs homeland‚Äîthe same homeland that gave me her loyalty with unwavering honor. If you carry her blood, then you carry the same flame I once thought had died with her.‚Äù

General Serebryakov-Kozzacko giving her favorite composer from relaxation being ready for her interview of her life in details, top secret information from her last life with non-favor light level of Rohypnol-Benzodiazepines plus high level of Ketamine beer for deep truth of her life. Then drinking drugged water with a light drink headed and slowed speech, generally showing the doctor to come here. ‚ÄúHow long will its effects last?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt lasted around 11-26 hours for our interview and lasted 12-37 min, the beer effect would be stronger. She drank/ took this before?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I remember she experimented with my mother about drugs plus she was drinking at parties like hers and my mother‚Äôs birthday.‚Äù

12 minutes later, ‚ÄúI was a Japanese salaryman who was hit by a train by my canceling on man's future with a logical mindset. From my personality as cold-hearted, atheistic, and[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism)social- darwinism atheism by a past that I want to forget. Being X (aka, god of the world) that I am seeing as Ancients from Stargate but more similar to Ori actually because my words sound like false teachings of origins. Never mind that this information was from my timeline with all these events happening 5 years earlier. Not all this event happens now that never happened in my timeline. I learned from this war within my timeline, but it was 10 years earlier than this timeline. I am not a girl for fixing this timeline because I know this from my own past life...‚Äù

She keeps talking about it. 11 hours later: ‚ÄúOK. I understand this about your past life, I want to know about this lifetime.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoctor, 11 hours have gone by. She needs to take more?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, she doesn't need to but she has 14 hours more to go away. I need to take Morphine from this to be successful. You can sleep in this interview and I will take it for medical reasons.‚Äù

Author‚Äôs words: This will be a summary of the interview for the future plots, this information will show about other volumes for you as a reader. Her words are similar to talking to the camera within a Live TV Show like hell‚Äôs kitchen.

""My new life in the Empire is one marked by conflict, and from the very beginning, I demonstrate a pragmatic, military-minded intelligence. My military career begins with my rapid rise through the ranks due to my remarkable talent for combat magic and tactical warfare. Despite being physically a child, my mind is that of a seasoned adult, focused on survival and strategic success. I am particularly known for my calculated, ruthless approach to war, gaining me the nickname The Devil of the Rhine.""

""I am not simply a war machine‚ÄîI am also a victim of Being X‚Äôs divine intervention. My primary personal goal becomes escaping the hold of the divine entity that placed me into this world, as I believe that I am being punished for my previous life‚Äôs atheism. Being X frequently appears to me as an elusive, god-like force, constantly interfering with my fate, leading to my internal struggle between my atheism and the undeniable existence of a higher power that controls my life.""

""My military tactics are brilliant, but they are also deeply pragmatic and often morally ambiguous. As an officer, I am deeply ruthless in my actions, using my magic and strategic intellect to crush my enemies without hesitation. I am quick to exploit weaknesses in my adversaries and, often, my subordinates as well. My cold pragmatism allows me to survive in a brutal, war-torn world where alliances are temporary, and lives are expendable.""

""My subordinates, such as the members of my elite unit‚Äîespecially my loyal subordinate, Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov‚Äîoften find themselves caught between loyalty to me and the sheer terror of my cold, emotionless nature. My leadership style is often marked by my ability to outmaneuver my opponents tactically, exploiting weaknesses and leveraging the power of magic to ensure my dominance on the battlefield. My ascent through the military hierarchy is both a testament to my intelligence and my willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure my survival.""

""The central conflict of my life is my struggle against Being X, who not only controls my fate but also serves as the embodiment of divine providence. I, an atheistic character, loathe this entity and view it as the embodiment of everything I despise: an arbitrary higher power that imposes a predetermined fate upon me. In my previous life, I was a strong believer in self-determination and individual agency, rejecting any notion of divine intervention or guidance.""

""As I rise in military rank, Being X continues to intervene in my life in an attempt to guide me toward a religious awakening or to prove the existence of divine providence. This constant interference from Being X frustrates me, pushing me to confront a series of existential dilemmas. I become increasingly focused on finding a way to escape the divine‚Äôs influence, believing that my survival, success, and eventual escape from the god‚Äôs manipulation are the ultimate tests of my power and intelligence.""

""My antagonism toward Being X becomes a defining characteristic of my journey, and my attempts to find meaning in a world dominated by war, manipulation, and divine control are central to the storyline. This philosophical battle between my atheism and Being X‚Äôs divine machinations becomes one of the core themes of my existence.""

""My worldview is shaped by my experiences in the military. In this world, the Empire and its neighboring nations are embroiled in a brutal, unending war, with alliances shifting as quickly as military strategies. Magic is a powerful tool of warfare, and military leaders are expected to be both powerful mages and skilled tacticians. My leadership and magical abilities make me one of the Empire‚Äôs most feared officers, though I am also deeply aware of the human cost of warfare.""

""My pragmatic approach to the violence around me is rooted in the philosophy of survival and the will to power. I subscribe to a form of social Darwinism, believing that only the strong survive and that the weak must be discarded in the face of conflict. While I do not lack a sense of loyalty or responsibility to my comrades, my moral compass is twisted by the harsh realities of the world I inhabit, where survival often comes at the expense of others.""

""Despite my ruthless actions, there are moments where my humanity surfaces. I experience guilt, pain, and doubt, especially when confronted with the futility of the wars I fight or the personal losses I endure. These moments of vulnerability complicate my otherwise cold and calculating persona, highlighting the internal conflict that defines much of my character.""

""My ultimate goal is to escape the clutches of Being X and, in doing so, free myself from the divine interference in my life. Throughout my journey, I am consistently trying to outsmart the divine, using my intellect, military genius, and magic to out-maneuver Being X‚Äôs plans. This goal defines much of my character arc and drives my actions in both military engagements and personal decisions.""

""My relationship with my subordinates evolves as well. While I initially treat them as mere tools in my ascent through the ranks, I come to recognize their value and loyalty. My bond with them, particularly with Viktoriya and my other subordinates, is complex‚ÄîI am both their leader and a person they look to for guidance, but at the same time, my methods often challenge their moral boundaries.""

""As my power grows, so too does the reach of Being X‚Äôs influence. The military conflicts I engage in become more complex and catastrophic, and my tactics are both admired and feared by all who witness them. However, as I approach the peak of my military career, my existential struggle with Being X comes to a head. I am faced with a final confrontation that will determine whether I can free myself from the divine's influence and prove that I can control my own fate.""

""The overarching plot of my life touches upon themes of free will versus divine fate, the morality of warfare, the corrupting nature of power, and the philosophical battle between belief and atheism. Throughout my journey, my character evolves from a purely pragmatic military leader to a person grappling with questions of identity, faith, and personal redemption.""

14 hours later: ‚ÄúErich, what happened in this interview.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis interview was 26 hours long, while you had these questions, that you black out. While answering all questions is similar to driving blindness, aunt said that we need to sleep because we need water from too much alcohol that we had without knowing about it. The doctor told me to go on for our interview by pushing sub-conscious.‚Äù

Next day, ‚ÄúAunt , drugging you for my knowledge of you. I know, my mother had this information for you, please don‚Äôt be pissed.‚Äù

‚ÄúErich, I don't do that much. I became friends with Being X, he told me in my dream. It is a secret from everything, I need to think about being X is actually my father from my past life. I can tell you and others about it, resetting them is the mother's secret to the whole family. I need to keep until I die like a full reset like a breaker, you know me more deeper then your mother for my sake.‚Äù

**Tanya von Degurechaf Courtroom From A Year Ago:**

A long, dark corridor lit by flickering sodium lamps. The air is damp with mildew and memory. Boots echo across concrete like distant gunfire. Tanya von Degurechaff enters, her posture soldier-straight, but her eyes‚Ä¶ hollow. She wears a plain olive-gray coat, stripped of medals and insignia‚Äîlike a ghost dressed in the shadow of her former self. Faces watch from both sides‚Äî soldiers, partisans, tribunal staff. Some in awe. Others in disgust. One old woman spits. At the front sits the panel: A Glorsku general, a Soviet commissar, a Jewish survivor in a modest shawl, and an American observer with a tape recorder. But the central voice is General Prahasko, the scar-faced veteran known for breaking war criminals with only questions.

‚ÄúTanya von Degurechaff. Former Commander, Imperial Mage Division. Known aliases: The Devil of the Rhine. Annihilation Angel. Secondhand Godchild. Accused of 21,500 confirmed civilian killings in the First War; indirect responsibility for around 80 million deportations and 4,356 extermination campaigns during the Second. Further accusations: psychological manipulation of child soldiers, deployment of unauthorized weapons upon surrendering forces, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStop. Stop now!!! I can hear it any more being I am saying please, forgive me please.‚Äù

She picks up a charred photograph from the mountain of documents. A burned village. A dying child‚Äôs eyes stare straight at her‚Äîcaptured forever. With her tears like depressed person going do suicide.

‚ÄúI... remember this one. That day... It was raining ash... I ordered it. I am like Hitler and Stalin in one person but I am the deadliest leader in the world. Fuck me, I was so evil more then worst one in my earth‚Äôs history.‚Äù

No denial. No apology. No attempt to shift blame. Just a broken soul standing naked before truth. Tanya pulls the files toward her‚Äîhands trembling, eyes hollow. And she begins to read aloud, each name, each location, each act. A ritual. A funeral. A courtroom exorcism. Tears stream silently. Each page a bullet into her own mythology.

‚ÄúThe Party has decided not to execute you. Instead‚Äîyour name, your rank, your identity... will be erased. For the crimes of Tanya von Degurechaff, there will be no legacy. Only shame.‚Äù

She slowly removes her overcoat and places it on the cold stone floor. A final act of surrender.

‚ÄúThen let her die here. With Suicidal mindset. Ashes of the Homeland for a new revolution is not just the overthrow of systems, but the honest facing of memory, guilt, and soul.‚Äù

She picks up the new registry document, signs it: Tanya walks alone through white ash and snow, her breath visible. Old barracks collapse in the wind behind her like memories crumbling. Children laugh in the distance, their voices bright but far. She stops. Watches. One tear rolls down her cheek‚Äînot for herself, but for the life she burned.

‚ÄúWhy, being X...? Why give me this life again? Perhaps‚Ä¶ one soul can still be rebuilt.‚Äù

She looks to the pale winter sky. That stopped her depressive mindset and by wanting to start a new life of peace.

**Tanya‚Äôs Dream:**

In the heart of a fractured world, where memory and time collide in fractured symphonies, Tanya finds herself on an endless train, racing through endless landscapes of history‚Äôs ghosts‚Äîwars, revolutions, empires rising and falling in moments, scattered and lost. She sits there, staring out the window, seeing not the road ahead but the smoldering ruins of places she's never been, yet somehow knows deeply, intimately. The train doesn‚Äôt stop, but the scenery shifts, constantly changing from one chapter of her life to the next‚Äîflashes of victories long forgotten, failures she can't remember, and desires that were never her own. It all merges, a kaleidoscope of past and future worlds, and Tanya is a spectator, but also the director.

Her feet don‚Äôt feel the train beneath her‚Äîthey feel the endless weight of the generations she carries on her shoulders. She tries to step off, but the floor beneath her dissolves, and she is transported into a courtroom, or perhaps a battlefield dressed as a courtroom. A figure sits at the front‚Äîher own face, twisted in judgment. She is both accused and accuser, and the crime is too vast to name. She opens her mouth to speak, to explain, to protest, but all that escapes her lips are screams‚Äîdissonant, tangled in a reel of static and memories too painful to untangle. The jury is made of faces she recognizes but can't place‚Äîthose she has loved, and those she has betrayed. They do not speak. No one speaks. The verdict is not theirs to give. Time itself stands still, a frozen weight pressing on her chest.

She‚Äôs thrust from this space, as if pulled by invisible hands, and suddenly, she is in an office‚Äîan office she never worked in, yet somehow, it‚Äôs hers. Papers cover the desk, blank, unreadable, like the future before her. The walls, devoid of pictures, are shifting, constantly rearranging themselves. The air hums with the sound of decisions she hasn‚Äôt made, lives she hasn‚Äôt lived, promises broken before they could be kept. In the corner of the room stands Viktoriya, a quiet figure, still, hands holding a cup of coffee that never cools. She stares at Tanya with eyes that hold both sympathy and reproach, asking softly, almost as if she already knows the answer: ‚ÄúWill you start over?‚Äù

Tanya opens her mouth, but before she can respond, the world itself bends around her. The walls crack, splintering into fragments that rain down like snowflakes, falling into an abyss of water. She doesn‚Äôt drown, but she sinks‚Äîdeeper, deeper, into a cold, silent ocean of her own making. Down below, she sees something. A figure, small, fragile, yet unbroken, stands on the ocean floor. It is herself, only younger‚Äîbarefoot, untarnished by the wars she fought, unscarred by the lessons she learned too late. This younger version of Tanya looks at her with soft eyes, not full of judgment or pity, but a quiet, painful understanding. The child speaks in a voice that isn‚Äôt really a voice, but a pull at her heart: ‚ÄúRemember... and choose.‚Äù

And then everything stops. The water stills, the office vanishes, the train ceases its endless motion. Tanya wakes‚Äîbut she is not where she was. She is not who she was. She is something *new*, something *other*, yet still herself in ways she cannot yet understand. The train, the endless ride, is still there, but now, it no longer holds her captive. She is not rushing to somewhere she must be, nor is she chasing something that no longer matters. She sits, still, and looks out at the passing world with eyes that have finally seen it for what it truly is‚Äîfragile, broken, yet beautiful. And for the first time in ages, she doesn't feel the weight of history bearing down on her, nor the responsibility of wars not her own. She feels free.

In this final moment of clarity, she understands that the dream is not hers to conclude. It holds no end, no final destination. It is simply a journey‚Äîan endless series of steps she must choose to take, day by day, moment by moment, unburdened by a past that doesn‚Äôt belong to her, or a future she cannot control. In the space between what is and what could be, she chooses‚Äînot to flee, but to live, to forgive, to remember. To start anew. Even as empires fall and new banners rise, even as Tanya von Degurechaff becomes Tanya Gureƒçafska, no new name can erase the past. No revolution can erase the memories of the soul. I know I am broken inside, but I will heal from this.

**Her Bedroom:**

Tanya awakens, drenched in cold sweat, her hands trembling as the remnants of her dream linger in the stillness of the room. The nightmare, a shattered mosaic of past and future, leaves her shaken, as though she's been dragged across time itself by forces she cannot name or escape. The weight of her past decisions presses heavily on her chest, suffocating, relentless. She stands there, facing the mirror in her quiet bedroom, staring at her reflection. The woman in the glass is no longer just Tanya von Degurechaff; she is a soul fractured by endless wars, hollow victories, and a future that stretches out, as boundless and empty as the train she was trapped on in her dream.

In this moment of painful clarity, she feels something unfamiliar stir within her‚Äîa voice, perhaps her own, perhaps something more, urging her to remember. To choose. To start anew. The young girl she saw beneath the ocean‚Äôs depths, untouched by the world‚Äôs burdens, gazes at her with quiet understanding. ""Remember... and choose."" A pull at her heart, as though this decision is the key to breaking free from the never-ending cycle of destruction.

Tanya‚Äôs gaze shifts from the mirror, where her reflection begins to morph into the figure of her past life as a Japanese salaryman‚Äîsilent, composed, holding a cup of coffee. Her presence is both soothing and accusatory. ""Will you start over?"" The question lingers in the air, an undeniable challenge. For a brief moment, Tanya freezes, not from fear, but from the weight of what such a choice means. The walls around her crack, shattering like the illusions she has carefully constructed. She sinks‚Äînot into despair, but into something deeper, something unspoken, a quiet catharsis.

Tears fall‚Äîunexpected, soft, but necessary. For the first time, she does not flee. She does not run from the past, nor from the future. She simply chooses‚Äîto live, to forgive, to remember. Not to escape, but to begin again, as if every moment, every decision, is hers to shape. And in that fragile, fleeting moment of clarity, Tanya feels free‚Äîfree from the past, free from the train, free from the wars that once defined her existence. She is still herself, but a new version. The journey is far from over, and perhaps it never will be, but now, she is no longer a prisoner. She is the one who will choose the next step, even in the face of all that still needs healing.

*Erich didn‚Äôt approach me seeking mercy; he approached out of necessity. The world they lived in‚Äîfragile, shattered‚Äîwas on the edge of another catastrophe. New powers were rising from the wreckage of old wars, much like my own world in the 20th century. They needed my tactical brilliance, her understanding of war on a scale no other soul could comprehend.*

""I believed in logic alone. In this life, I believed only in survival. In the next‚Ä¶ perhaps I will learn to believe in souls. The higher I rise, the deeper the scars I leave, both on the world and on myself.""

*I eventually come to realize that no victory, no accumulation of power, no clever evasion of Being X‚Äôs plans can erase the weight of what I‚Äôve done. The blood of the Rhine, the ashes of the villages, the broken gazes of children‚Äîthey never wash away, no matter how far I run, or how high I climb.*

This DVD has uncut scenes without a 50% discount, and then it says, **""This DVD has uncut scenes with a 50% discount!!!** Call XXX-XXX-XXXX, Call XXX-XXX-XXXX!!!""

""This is so annoying about buying DVDs, always the cash grab! I hate how they do this every time a series ends!"" he says. He turns to his mom and says, ""Mom, you‚Äôre crying because I‚Äôm crying."" *My mom is the most sensitive in the family, unlike my dad, who‚Äôs the complete opposite‚Äîhe came from a military family, just like my grandpa, who fought in the Pacific during WWII.*

""No, I‚Äôm not crying. I‚Äôm just cutting onions for dinner. Son, you‚Äôre too impulsive for your own name,"" she replies.

Hey, I am the narrator here. For non-Japanese speakers, \[„Åæ„Çì„Åï„Çâ„Çä\]\[Êúç„Çµ„É©„É™„Éº„Éû„É≥„ÅÆ\] reads as *Mansarari Fukusaraimanu*. His name roughly means ""Mansarari‚Äôs Clothes for Businessmen."" I‚Äôm so happy about this flashback‚Äîit brings back the nostalgia of my childhood in NYC. I‚Äôm sharing this from my memory, back when DVDs and TV were annoyingly always pushing you to buy DVDs or CDs. But looking back, it was simple‚Äînothing like today‚Äôs chaos with social media.

Few weeks after his isekaization, line to the door with everyone that he knew plus people in the train station.

‚ÄúAll rise. The Honorable Judge Hayashi presiding.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople, be seated. We are here to determine liability and damages regarding the psychological consequences left behind by the presumed death‚Äîor disappearance‚Äîof Mansarari Fukusa- raimanu.

|**Father‚Äôs Suicide Letter:** **Dear My Lovely Wife:** If you are reading this, it means I could no longer carry the weight. I‚Äôm sorry‚ÄîI‚Äôm so deeply sorry for the pain this may cause you, though I fear my absence will only echo the emptiness that has already begun to take root. Our son is gone. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm writing those words. I can‚Äôt breathe knowing they are true. The light of my life, the boy I held in my arms, taught to walk, taught to speak, and dreamed with‚Äîhe's gone. And no reason, no explanation, no justice can ever make that right. I tried to be strong for you. For him. But the silence left in his absence is louder than any scream. And when the truth arrived‚Äîtoo late, too sharp‚Äîit broke something in me that cannot be repaired. He died, and the world kept turning like nothing had happened. That‚Äôs the part I can't live with. What kind of father am I if I can‚Äôt protect my son? What kind of man survives while his child is buried beneath questions and grief? Please forgive me. This is not your fault. It‚Äôs not even mine alone. It is the fault of a world that waited too long, and a justice system that counts days while we count pieces of our hearts. I cannot endure this timeline any longer. I am coming for him like helping in my next life. Forever yours, Your Beloved Husband|

In the trial taking longer his Mother expected and she got a heart attack from his father dead by suicide from the information of his sons death. Later, they make his whole family as a burial being with three of them into their graves.

**Chapter Two: Journey Begins**

We come back to this reality, a term called SP-01 coming out from some desert that they thought of as Sahara. ‚ÄúWow, it is successful. Later I thought, GG-01 and GG-02 need to ride on Pionir with me opposite the way of sunset because you know from geology. You need to learn Francois because you know our enemy language (from our occupation by Nazis) for your own good, GG-03 and GG-04 staying next to the portal for sending messages to we made it plus protecting the gateway. Let‚Äôs go, we need to come back to our base for making plans then giving it to our government not only saving our comrades.‚Äù

A few days later, ‚Äúwhere is the other side of the port city called Nouadhibou and New Nouad- hibou is a town that gives a faster path for us by ferry, not ships like in that city.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you sound like autistic. You've been in here before?‚Äù Everyone is laughing while the truck is shaking like an earthquake.

‚ÄúOf course, it was my visit to Henri Joseph Goumenri. He is like us for socialism and anti-imperial, I love his work like Erich will talk about because I want to know you more than you know me like you are doing now. Well we still need to go to New Nouadhibou, you need to go for other topics. Sorry, for that our discussion from my past. Similar question about Greece, like you talked about a girl that you have a crush on?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no. She isn‚Äôt like that for me,‚Äù why‚Äôll blush at the same time.

‚ÄúYou know you are cute, when you are blushing. Look at Horizon, New Nouadhibou is close. We will be around an hour, that good that we are not living in the Firefly universe. New Nouadhibou is his hometown, he has few kids that you like spending time with. Someone is attacking the town and city, Nazi pirates. No, it is not them. Resistance freighter, you need to be ready to fight like in Stalingrad. We can fly well because I was banned from flying, they have it. Fuck, I‚Äôll be using it from them. Now, go faster.‚Äù

They are shocked about Resistance frights coming from flying overhead on a beetle, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have armor like they have stolen the tech. We need to fight with French forces for our safety, you need to say to them that we are Glorsku army in exile.‚Äù

‚ÄúPirate Raid Sirens combined all of H√∂rmann and Siemens sirens into ones called Sir√®nes d'occupation system and Siemens one is louder for telling what it is air for example, he is training your skills against resistance like under our nation will have.‚Äù They are riding to the town with a non-propaganda song to hide their identity, ‚ÄúGoumenri don‚Äôt know about our identity. He will understand about it, better to change the topic about how we are opposites for our own good.‚Äù

An hour later, the town is in ruin from the pirate's defensive raid system screaming out like a crying baby from top of the lungs while going into the city. People doing their things then people are punching, they are running into shelters like cattle herds going into processing facilities from the deadliest shot called bunker busters bullet. ‚ÄúTury≈õci odchodzƒÖ od ogona i budynku, do magazynu, a ty mo≈ºesz popatrzeƒá na prasƒô.‚Äù - Their misunderstanding from a Pospolita tour guide into their language. ‚ÄúTurist√© jdou na chvostu budov√°m, ke skladov√°n√≠ a mohou b√Ωt star√© u tisku.‚Äù- what the tour guide actually said.

Children are playing around with their bikes and scooters within bomb craters, ‚Äúgoing to the shelter and meeting up with their parents‚Ä¶ What up, my old friend and come to bomb shelter with me. I like to talk about our life going on, I heard an Empire dictator looks similar to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Tanya! How are you, my old friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Goumenri?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, he is. He will help with our issues, if you ask anything that he will do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will fight for your city because we are the Free Glorsku Corps of the International Occup- ational Army. I know you need time with Tanya for old pals to do.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you know that the Cold War is between National Liberal and Social Liberal from outcry from National Socialism (White Army and Weimarium), I predict the West will be an unholy social liberal like in 1930s-40s.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear about Nazical Watch Trials from members of the Imperiale Weibliche V√∂lkisch Prinzip Ordnungs Partei (Imperial People of Girlhood Order Principle Party)? That truth about your prediction with my own will be like your mindset, the pact of nations will be going opposite paths like we are seeing now in our modern world that people are aware of it. I will teach you about the power of wisdom from scientific magic, I was the master of your general and Tanya came to me to relearn wisdom from god but she didn‚Äôt learn from him.‚Äù

They all going into shelter but they don‚Äôt know those tourist are spies of Peoples Rzeczpospolita, Rzeczpospolian can speaking Rusynian language put within Sokolia/ G√≥ralska/ Rzeczpos- polita for international language is dialectics per language (this is like paradox from coming from dying language, they don‚Äôt know it is there god is dead but other god took over dying world like ‚ÄúThe Boy and The Horn‚Äù can be called beauty of death by giving alway to other generation).

Where did you find that? I don‚Äôt mind you keeping it because finder keepers, I need to take over that pok√©mon ball factory.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is a Pok√©mon ball? Pok√©mon ball, a toy or something else like a grenade?""

‚ÄúHey Kid, throw it in the corner with your mother standing next to you to protect you from us.‚Äù Then that kid throws the pok√©mon ball, there is a type of Pok√©mon.

‚ÄúWait. what? That is a Gadmeer or Mewtwo! Mewtwo (from Pok√©mon) made Gadmeer (Stargate) into their civilizational empire/-s, Mewtwo escaped into Stargate‚Äôs Universe by Quantum Window becoming Gadmeer from finding a time machine in their views?‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, my race is Gadmeer Beta Alius from the pok√©mon genus called Mewtwo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, you proved my theory about Pok√©mon's Universe Quantum Windowed Stargate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to be your Pok√©mon because you know my kind and stargate so why‚Äôll.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this reality that we have music and gate guns, Stargate is called Starportal in this reality. I will call you from Taban-bƒô (Nepanese language of datebase), do you love that? Pok√©mon can‚Äôt exist in this world, what is your main culture?‚Äù Nepan is Japan in this reality not Nepal, XP.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, it may fit you more than my own title. My race is that we are using a Pok√©mon ball coming from Mewtwo world as an original world like Pok√©mon ball factories in abandoned islands, it was nuked around a few nuclear bombs per island.‚Äù The Pok√©mon world looks like a type of utopia that comes from the eyes of a kid but the reality is darker or even darker then our timeline/ world like his pre-isekaizian Earth history, ‚ÄúI want to say something and ask a ques- tion. What is your name? How is the quantum window different from the quantum mirror?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is only cats and pok√©mon understands, humans need to name us like pets and that is shameful. I want to see your most popular cities and landmarks on Earth, like you have in Roo- sevelt Island Civic Center, New York, New Yorkshire, New England?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, we expect that it isn't called New York, New Yorkshire but Yankeeham, Yankeeshire in Angloland and we have Roosevelt-Randall-Ricker-Governor Island Civic Center for the SEM-P system like other nations have there to better control over the nation with Dingecommunism/ Resgemeinsamism from Rzeczpospolitism within Rzeszpospolitism.

1m2zsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepEssentialsIndia/comments/1m2zsky/practical_guide_to_better_sleep/,Practical Guide to Better Sleep,"Sleep isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúrest.‚Äù It‚Äôs when your body and mind recharge, fix, and reset. Yet many of us struggle with poor sleep because of habits, stress, screens, and noise.

Sleep hygiene is a set of daily habits and choices that make sleep deeper and more regular. Good sleep hygiene can cut down tired mornings, boost focus, improve mood, and lower health risks like heart disease and diabetes.

Here‚Äôs a **practical guide** to what works and why.

## What is Sleep Hygiene?

Simple daily actions and environment tweaks to:

*   Fall asleep faster
    
*   Sleep deeper
    
*   Wake up fresher
    

Poor sleep hygiene = late nights, screens in bed, coffee late in the day, noisy bedrooms, irregular schedules.


## Key Parts of Sleep Hygiene

| Habit | Why It Helps | How To Do It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regular schedule | Keeps body clock steady | Same sleep & wake time daily, even weekends |
| Dark room | Darkness triggers melatonin | Blackout curtains, eye mask, no screens |
| Quiet | Noise breaks sleep cycles | Earplugs, white noise, heavy curtains |
| Cool temp | Body needs to cool to sleep | 16‚Äì19¬∞C, breathable sheets |
| Limit caffeine/alcohol | Both delay and fragment sleep | Avoid coffee after 2 pm, no alcohol 3‚Äì4 hrs before bed |
| Move daily | Exercise helps deeper sleep | Walk, cycle, or stretch, not right before bed |
| Pre-sleep wind down | Lowers stress & signals sleep time | Read, stretch, journal, dim lights |


## Light & Sleep

*   Morning sunlight (15‚Äì30 min) helps reset your body clock.
    
*   Avoid screens 1‚Äì2 hours before bed. If needed, use blue light filters.
    
*   Use warm, dim lighting in evenings.
    

- - -

## Noise & Sleep

*   Traffic, TVs, or people talking can wake you.
    
*   White or pink noise machines can mask sudden sounds.
    
*   Rugs, curtains, or acoustic panels help too.
    

## Temperature & Comfort

*   Best sleep temp is about 16‚Äì19¬∞C.
    
*   Light cotton or linen bedding helps.
    
*   Avoid heavy meals or hot showers before bed.
    

- - -

## Evening Routine

*   Stop doom-scrolling and emails before bed.
    
*   Try reading, gentle yoga, or deep breathing.
    
*   Keep it consistent so your body expects sleep.
    

## Substances & Sleep

*   Caffeine: stays in your body for hours. Avoid after 2 pm.
    
*   Alcohol: may make you sleepy at first but fragments deep sleep.
    
*   Nicotine and some meds also disrupt sleep‚Äîask a doctor if unsure.
    

## Extra Tips

*   Short nap? Keep it under 20‚Äì30 min.
    
*   Track your sleep to see what affects it‚Äîbut don‚Äôt obsess over numbers.
    
*   If you can‚Äôt sleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something calming.
    
*   Try to eat dinner at least 2‚Äì3 hours before bed.

## Why It Matters

Good sleep hygiene can:

*   Sharpen focus and memory
    
*   Improve mood
    
*   Lower risk of diabetes and heart disease
    
*   Boost energy for daily life
    
## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Can‚Äôt fall asleep | Get out of bed, do a calm activity, go back only when sleepy |
| Wake up often | Check for noise, light, heat or medical reasons |
| Daytime tiredness | Check sleep hours, cut caffeine, regular schedule |
| Irregular sleep | Adjust bedtime slowly, avoid long naps |",1,1752838051.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False

We were dating for a year at that point and so even though I was uncomfortable with it, the relationship was too young to make demands about it. 

It has caused some strain, especially since she‚Äôs had a reputation for being a cheater. She once left lingerie calendars of herself in the kitchen. I had to stay at the house for a few days when my lease was up, and she invited his ex over for coffee (they‚Äôre friends, but also why would you do it while I‚Äôm at the house..) She doesn‚Äôt mean badly and there is no sexual tension between them I‚Äôm sure - she is just clueless and rude. 

I always feel awkward visiting the house, and it‚Äôs been two years now. I asked my boyfriend to come away with me this year and travel/work. He refused, as is doing a masters. 

Now he‚Äôs staying in the same town in the same house for a third year. So now if I want to visit him.. I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to stay in that house with her (especially considering the last time I did I had to walk into his ex at the table). It‚Äôs also too expensive to get a hotel often. 

I asked him if he‚Äôs thinking about moving out. He said it‚Äôs too much hassle. He likes where he lives. Any advice? Should I just get over myself? ",2,1752837930.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I (29F) and my friend Maria (fake name) (30F) have known each other since we were kids. We met at school when we were 7 and became especially close during our teenage years. We were always kind of ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from the rest of our friend group ‚Äî more open-minded, more internationally minded, more‚Ä¶ us. 

I was the only one in our group of 5‚Äì6 girls who openly said I had no interest in getting married. I‚Äôve always wanted a life partner, not a husband, and the whole idea of marriage always felt unnecessary to me. Same goes for having kids. I basically raised myself, my mother, and most of my friends. Since I was young, I carried the emotional load for myself and others, and without even realizing it until recently, this is probably that led to me developing a deep resistance to motherhood. It just didn‚Äôt feel right for me. This will make sense later on.

That said, I‚Äôve always been the first to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the cool aunt, the one dancing at your wedding and babysitting your kids.‚Äù I had mentally prepared for a lifetime of being the child-free one in the group, and honestly, I‚Äôm completely fine with that.

Now to the actual story.

One day, Maria told me that she and her partner had started trying for a baby. She was very honest and said she wasn‚Äôt quite ready yet, but since it can take time to get pregnant, they were starting now, just casually. I was really happy for her. I even started joking about being ‚Äúauntie‚Äù to her hypothetical child. I wished them all the best.

Three months later, she called me at night and told me she took a test and it was positive. Now, keep in mind, during those three months she had told me *many* times that she still didn‚Äôt feel ready. So when she called, I didn‚Äôt know how to react. I asked her how she felt; was she excited? Anxious? Scared? Happy? I just wanted to meet her where *she* was emotionally.

She said she was happy, but wasn‚Äôt 100% sure about the result. It was a late-night test, and she wanted to confirm it in the morning. She mentioned that she had taken a test the month before too, and it came back negative, which really upset her. So this time, she didn‚Äôt want to get her hopes up.

I told her that made sense and it would be better to check again the next morning. She agreed, and said she was also worried because she‚Äôd had some wine the night before and hadn‚Äôt even missed her period yet. So yeah, I said, let‚Äôs not jump to conclusions until test #2. I felt kind of bad for not jumping up and down and being sceptical when she told me, but I was honestly very confused with all the info I had.

Spoiler: Test #2 was positive.

She told her partner, and I was thrilled for them both. I was ready to spoil the baby rotten.

That‚Äôs when her anxiety started. The ‚ÄúAm I ready?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if something goes wrong?‚Äù phase. Her first trimester was rough. She had intense nausea and couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. I visited her often and even once put together a little care package with baby food (the only thing she could stomach), some of her fav snacks just in case, and little comfort items like scrunchies and fluffy socks to lift her mood. I always called her after her doctor appointments to check in, and I did my best to calm her worries when she spiraled, which was often.

But I also started noticing some things that felt... over the top.

For example: we were walking down the street once, and a guy *in the distance* started running to catch a train. He wasn‚Äôt coming toward us, not even close. But Maria immediately grabbed her belly and turned away like someone was charging at her. I asked what was wrong, and she said she got scared because he was running.

I told her she needed to relax ‚Äî people don‚Äôt just sprint elbow-first into strangers. And also, if just *bumping into someone* (not that this guy was even close to us!) could threaten a pregnancy, humanity would‚Äôve gone extinct long ago. I tred to say that she has to enjoy her pregnancy like she always wanted and don‚Äôt worry for all the things that could go wrong, but of course it did nothing for her.

There were a lot of moments like this. But I kept telling myself, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs pregnant. Hormones. Anxiety. It‚Äôs understandable.‚Äù

One time she was carrying a small grocery bag (which she had picked up and held herself, by the way) and then looked at me like ‚ÄúTake this, I‚Äôm not supposed to lift heavy things.‚Äù I took it ofc, but I was a bit annoyed, since her attitude was starting to be unreasonably demanding. Another time, I had bad period cramps and was instinctively holding my lower stomach, and she looked at me all snarky and said, ‚ÄúWhy are *you* holding your stomach now?‚Äù, as if holding your stomach is a privilege that only pregnant women have. I just told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in pain. It‚Äôs a normal reflex. A lot of women do that during their period and I certainly always have done it.‚Äù

Another moment: when she told her mom she was pregnant, she did it by showing her a cute video titled ‚ÄúWhat it means to be a grandma.‚Äù Her mom didn‚Äôt get it and Maria was visibly annoyed. I reminded her that her mom already has *four* grandkids. This wasn't *news* in the same way. That kind of announcement video works best when it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs *first* grandchild ‚Äî not their fifth. I gave her the example of her becoming a mother now, so when she has her next one, she will already be a mother. She got mad at me for saying that. I guess I wasn‚Äôt being ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù enough?

Anyway, I even threw her a small gender reveal ‚Äî just her, her partner, me and my partner. Everything seemed fine on the surface‚Ä¶ but the more time passed, the more I felt like I couldn‚Äôt be myself around her. I was walking on eggshells. And the last thing I wanted was to upset her or make her feel unsupported, so I just‚Ä¶ let her take the lead. Let her choose the conversations. Let her guide what we did.

Maria had told me she wanted me to be a big part of this new chapter in her life and I felt the same way. I told her I was genuinely excited and that *literally anything* she needed, no matter how silly or small, she should just tell me. I was ready to vacuum her apartment, iron her clothes (and I HATE ironing), or hold the baby while she took a nap. I wanted to learn everything: what newborns need, and what new mothers need even more.

For me, it was never about the baby. I knew the baby would have all the attention from family, friends, and his father. I wanted to make sure *she* was okay and I made this very clear to her.

Side note: I‚Äôm not really a ‚Äúkid person.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt get along with them, I just prefer not to have kids in my life. But I‚Äôd made it clear: when a kid is ‚Äúours‚Äù, meaning part of our world, loving them is non-negotiable.

After she gave birth, every time we visited (my partner always came too ‚Äî the four of us were still technically a crew), I always checked in on *her* first. How was she feeling? Was she okay? When she cried and said everything felt overwhelming, I reassured her: it‚Äôs normal. Her body was flooded with hormones, she wasn‚Äôt sleeping, and everything was unfamiliar. She was doing great and nothing was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with her.

On the phone, when she mentioned chores piling up, I‚Äôd offer to come over and help, maybe get some cleaning done and catch up a bit. She always said no. If I had extra food or made something I knew she liked, I‚Äôd call and ask if she wanted some for her and her partner.  
Again ‚Äî no thanks.

She often complained to me about all the people coming over to visit the baby. She said she was tired of always having guests and just wanted quiet time with her partner and their child as a family. Totally valid. But after hearing that enough times, and getting turned down repeatedly, I started stepping back. I stopped offering help so often but not out of resentment, but because I didn‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable or feel like I was pushing myself into their space.

Then came the moment that really stung. I had asked her to teach me how to change diapers since I wanted to be helpful and confident if I ever needed to step in. She showed me once. The next time we visited, her partner was changing the baby‚Äôs diaper. I stood nearby, holding the baby‚Äôs socks, and reached over to gently help just by putting the socks on. He *snatched* them from my hands and did it himself.

It hurt. A lot. Like I wasn't allowed to touch the baby, cause I would hurt it somehow. But I once again gave them grace. They were new parents. They were setting boundaries. Maybe they still needed space. I let it go.

Then came the baby‚Äôs first birthday. Maria scheduled it *on the exact same day* I had a final exam for my Master‚Äôs, something she had known for *months*. The exam was in another city, a 2.5-hour flight away. Skipping wasn‚Äôt an option. Failing it would mean risking another round of tuition, which was a four-digit amount. So my partner went alone, with the baby‚Äôs gift and a small box I‚Äôd prepared just for Maria and her partner. The box had fun adult items: alcohol, coffee, the devil‚Äôs lettuce, lube, funny coasters that said ‚ÄúBest Mom/Dad Ever,‚Äù and a handwritten card that said: ‚ÄúToday we celebrate your son, but also *you two* ‚Äî one full year of parenting. You‚Äôre doing amazing. Take care of yourselves. Stay close to each other.  
Your happiness is the foundation of your family‚Äôs happiness.‚Äù

Their response?

‚ÄúAwwww thanks so much‚Äù  
And that was it. No comment. No follow-up. Nothing.

Around that time, they also started planning their wedding.

In our culture, it‚Äôs common to have a joint wedding and baptism when the baby‚Äôs still young.  
We had previously talked about me being Maria‚Äôs maid of honor. Now, she asked me to be the godmother too. I was over the moon and I promised her that I‚Äôd do everything in my power to be the *best* one I could.

She was understandably stressed. New mom, planning a wedding, the last thing I watned is to add pressure. So I waited for her to guide the process. I didn‚Äôt want to say or do anything that would trigger more stress.

Then, during a visit, she asked to talk privately. She said: ‚ÄúIf being the godmother feels like too much for you, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt do it if it‚Äôs going to stress you.‚Äù

Looking back, that was a flashing red flag. But at the time? I didn‚Äôt get it.

I told her I didn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd say that. I said multiple times that I *wanted* to be her child‚Äòs godmother. But I gave her the option; if she had someone else in mind, I wouldn‚Äôt be offended. I reassured her it wouldn‚Äôt change anything between us. She should pick whoever made her feel most comfortable.

Fast forward: my partner and I ended up paying around **‚Ç¨5,000** total ‚Äî between godparent and wedding costs, flights (destination wedding), bachelor/bachelorette stuff, outfits, accommodations, everything. And through it all? We weren‚Äôt involved in *anything*. We were just paying.

I didn‚Äôt expect to choose the flowers or the cake, but I *had* believed her when she said we‚Äôd be part of the experience. In the end, the only thing we did was pay and cash a favor with a friend of mine that did their table decorations for free.

Still, I justified everything. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just stressed.‚Äù ‚ÄúEverything will go back to normal after the wedding.‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt and it has already been 2 years since all this started this far.

I cried during the ceremony, not out of sadness, but because I was truly happy for her.  
She got the day she wanted, with the man she loved. She got the life she always dreamed of. And she chose to share it with me. That meant something.

Or so I thought.

The few days after the wedding? Nothing. We exchanged a couple of logistical texts.  
That was it. We had *one* day planned (months in advance) to finally relax together as friends and see the baby again. They canceled last minute. They went out for lunch with Maria‚Äôs brother, whom they saw *constantly* anyway. Meanwhile, *we* hadn‚Äôt seen them, or the baby, in 2.5 months. Maria had left early for the wedding city to prep things, so this was supposed to be the first post-wedding hangout.

She was cold. Not like a friend who‚Äôs busy. Like a person who no longer wants you around.  
  
Next time we talked was when they called us for wish happy birthday to my partner in october (the wedding was august) and we arranged a coffee date to see them and especially our godson. That‚Äôs when we told them that we decided to get married. (More about this later on.) We meet a few times after, but I was always the one initiating contact.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I asked Maria to meet up,  just the two of us. I told her straight up: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be honest, if I don‚Äôt start this conversation, you won‚Äôt.‚Äù She agreed.

What followed was an *eight-hour* conversation. There were tears. It was intense. I obviously can‚Äôt write out the whole thing here, but here are the key moments that stuck with me:

\-¬†I told her that my partner and I felt like walking wallets, since we were just expected to pay for her wedding and baptism without really being part of anything. We didn‚Äôt get to experience the process, and it didn‚Äôt feel joyful to us. Her response?

‚ÄúIt was *our* wedding. We did what we wanted. It wasn‚Äôt your place to have any say. I wouldn‚Äôt have done anything differently.‚Äù This is¬† valid, but this is not what I meant. Being part of my friends wedding shouldn‚Äôt feel like I am taken advantage of, at least I don‚Äôt think so.

\-¬†She said she had expected ‚Äúmore‚Äù from me. When I asked what she meant, she said I‚Äôd promised to help with cooking, cleaning, babysitting etc. I reminded her that I *did* offer those things, repeatedly. I even told her I could show her all the texts and calls where I tried to help and she declined. Her answer?

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how new moms are. We don‚Äôt ask for help. You should‚Äôve just come anyway.‚Äù I told her that was *completely* contradictory to what she‚Äôd said over and over: ‚ÄúWe need time, just the three of us.‚Äù That was a clear boundary and I respected it. I wasn‚Äôt going to push my way into their home or overstep, especially during such a vulnerable time. She didn‚Äôt respond.

\-¬†She said our friendship ended, for her, the moment I didn‚Äôt call her to say I got engaged. This indeed happened, but what is important to know is that me and my partner do not care about these things. The only reason we decided to get married is for leagal reasons and what she calls an ‚Äöengagement‚Äò was us deciding to go to the court house and sign the papers. My partner also got me a ring as a gift, but tbh, he often buys me jewelry anyway, I have multiple rings from him. I told her that after 20+ years of friendship, she should know that engagements and weddings aren‚Äôt a big deal to me. Certainly not enough to call people and make announcements, social media posts etc. PLUS, we hadn‚Äôt spoken in months. The last time we did, she canceled on me for a better plan and treated my partner and me like we were strangers.

  
She insisted that *my* engagement was emotionally significant *for her*, and that she cried all day when she found out I hadn‚Äôt told her. I was stunned. I repeated: ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt significant for *me*.‚Äù Why should I base my communication around *her* feelings about *my* life, especially when things were already so cold between us? No clear answer. Just more crying. More self-victimization.

\- At one point, she said: ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs my fault for having expectations of people who don‚Äôt live up to them.‚Äù And I wanted to laugh. Like all of us, she has strengths and flaws. One of her flaws (and I say this with love) is that she‚Äôs incredibly self-centered. I‚Äôve always known that. I accepted it. That‚Äôs what love is, right? Accepting someone with their flaws. She‚Äôs *far* from a people-pleaser, but she framed herself like she was one. To *me.* Me, who was such a hardcore people-pleaser for most of my life that I didn‚Äôt even *have* a life of my own. I didn‚Äôt say anything. Her experience is valid, and maybe she sees herself that way. But it felt so disconnected from reality I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

\- She told me she doesn‚Äôt think I love her child, and that the whole ‚Äúgodmother thing‚Äù felt too much for me. That‚Äôs when I got angry. Now she knows better how I feel? I gave her so many examples of how much I care about him. I reminded her that *the only reason* we‚Äôre still talking at all is *because* of him. I told her, bluntly, that if it weren‚Äôt for her son, I would‚Äôve cut off contact completely. She agreed. I still don‚Äôt understand how both those things can be true.¬†

\- The only real ‚Äúwrongdoing‚Äù she brought up from my side was that once, during her pregnancy, I told her about a true crime documentary I‚Äôd watched where one of the victims happened to be pregnant.  
I love true crime, and for years I‚Äôd shared with her wild stories I saw or read about. In this case, the woman and her baby *survived* and lived a totally healthy life afterward.  
I honestly don‚Äôt see how that was disturbing, especially when later, *she* gossiped about another pregnant woman who had lost her baby. If anything, *that* should‚Äôve been more upsetting to her, right? Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I don‚Äôt know.

\-¬†At the end of the conversation, she asked, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what now?‚Äù I told her I needed time. I didn‚Äôt know how long, and I couldn‚Äôt promise anything about our future. The only thing I *could* promise was that I wouldn‚Äôt disappear from her son‚Äôs life. Even if our friendship ended, my partner and I would still be there for him.

But even after that marathon of a talk, and her telling me that she missed me and other nice things, it was still *just me* reaching out for the next several months. We were still the ones initiating everything; trying to see the kid, proposing to hang out (even just the adults, like old times).

  
Until one day, recently, the realization really hit me: I‚Äôm the only one texting. I‚Äôm the only one making plans. I‚Äôm the only one who seems to care about keeping this ‚Äöfriendship‚Äò going.

Maria lives like her family is the *only* thing that matters, not just to her, but to everyone in the world. She behaves like I should be grateful to her for even allowing me to exist near her and her family and puts down any accomplishment or problem I have. And look, if she truly believes that nothing in life is meaningful outside of her partner and her son, that‚Äôs her right. She can live her life however she wants. But the passive-aggressive posts on social media ‚Äî the ones that say life has no meaning without children ‚Äî are hard to not feel targeting.

  
The comments she‚Äôs made about me are hurtful to say the least.Things like, I‚Äôll never be a good mom because I don‚Äôt *want* to be one (As if every woman who *wants* to be a mother automatically becomes a great one. Sure.). Or that I am being dramatic when I say I am tired when I work fulltime and study for my Master fulltime, while working a second job once a week, cause ‚Äöother people have done it and they survived‚Äò. When we moved we found an amazing apartment that got complimented from everyone we know and they had only negative things to say about it (mostly things that weren‚Äôt even true). When we got married the lady that gathered all our documents and such asked us many questions about our history as a couple and she ended up writing an amaying personalized speech for us that she read the day of. When I asked my friend, who attented ofc, what she thought about the speech and how thoughtful it was, she just made the sound ‚Äöehh‚Äò.

Her attitude makes me feel like I must‚Äôve done something *terribly* wrong. That I hurt her in some deep way I can‚Äôt see. That all the bitterness she directs toward me must have *some* basis ¬†and I just don‚Äôt know what it is.

But I truly don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. The only thing I *can* pinpoint is that I was more patient with her than she probably deserved. I tolerated things I shouldn‚Äôt have. I let too many things slide. And maybe I gave her the space to treat me this way, but she just took full advantage of it. I can‚Äôt really blame her for that. People take what they‚Äôre given.

But still‚Ä¶ Is there something I‚Äôm missing?

If anyone has any perspective, I‚Äôd truly appreciate it. I have no problem owning my mistakes. I just want to understand *where*, if anywhere, I went wrong.",7,1752837783.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

1m2zpbw,https://i.redd.it/xw822x2jamdf1.jpeg,Grinder reassembling - toward ‚ÄúCoarse‚Äù makes grind finer? [La Pavoni Domus Bar],"Hi everyone,

As a new project I recently bought a used Pavoni Domus Bar. I disassembled and cleaned, including the built-in grinder (should be identical to the grinder in the Anita PL042 and the standalone grinder PL043). When I wanted to reassembling everything, I noticed something strange:

For the factory reset of the grinder, the upper burr needs to be screw down clockwise.

Now:
When I turn the outer grind adjustment knob toward ‚ÄúCoarse‚Äù, the upper burr rotates clockwise, which actually brings it closer to the lower burr.
As a result, the grind becomes finer, not coarser as expected.

This seems to completely reverse the expected behavior ‚Äî turning toward ‚ÄúCoarse‚Äù should increase the distance between the burrs and make the grind coarser, not finer.

What also irritates me: the manual states that 
> Choose higher degrees to get coarse-ground coffee or smaller degrees to get fine-ground coffee.

Attached a drawing of how the movement of the knob moves the bean housing

I‚Äôm wondering:
Did I reassemble the adjustment mechanism incorrectly?
Do I have a wrong understanding how the grinder should work? 
Could the thread/spindle or knob coupling be reversed?

Has anyone experienced this?
Any insight or some check how your grinder turns if you use the knob would be super helpful. Thanks!

1m2zly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1m2zly8/no_contact_day/,No contact day,"Me and AP met in high school. We had the same group of friends. My best friend was her best friend‚Äôs boyfriend. We knew each other well. 

After high school we were both single, one day we collided. It was like nothing I had ever experienced or even thought possible. We got engaged. It was the best year of my life. I joined the military to straighten out. I was a mess. 

When I was in bootcamp she kissed a guy. I broke off the engagement. At the time all the told me was she ‚Äúcheated.‚Äù If she would have just said she kissed a guy I would have just laughed it off. I didn‚Äôt learn that‚Äôs all it was until a month ago. Lol. She did everything right though to make amends unprompted. But I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I was young and idealistic. 

We kept in touch via phone. Hooked up a few times over the next couple years. The last time was about 17 years ago. I was such an ass. I couldn‚Äôt reconcile how much I loved her, and I could not believe it was possible for someone to actually love me back the same way I love them. Then I got sent to the other side of the world for a decade. I was a walking stereotype for alcohol consumption in the military. She started dating other people. I did too. We‚Äôre both really risk averse. Always do the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù thing. Risking everything to go across an ocean felt like a risk I couldn‚Äôt ask her to take. She would have taken it if I asked. 

Fast forward 17 years. I married someone else. So did she. We both have kids now. We were still in touch all this time. A few days or weeks of messages a couple times a year. Sometimes less. Sometimes more. I never stopped loving her. 

A couple months ago we got coffee. we were talking‚Ä¶ a lot. We put it in The context of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat. We decided to open the box to see if the cat was alive or dead. So‚Ä¶ coffee. And the cats alive. I told her how I had felt all these years. She was stuck in the same pattern wishing she could let me go. 

We spent until yesterday talking constantly. Yes NRE. But she and I always connected on all the levels. She challenges me spiritually. Intellectually. Sexually it was always amazing and that didn‚Äôt change. She‚Äôs super stable and successful in life. Me too. Solid career. There was just an ocean in between us and we both tried to move on wishing we weren‚Äôt moving on from each other. 

We just each thought we were setting the other one free. 

we drew up a plan. Go fix our lives. Give our marriages one last 110% shot. We set a date to go no contact. That was yesterday. We will have coffee in 1 year. Today I move to the other side of the world again. The one time we were within 20 minutes of each other since we split up for more than a few days.

And I‚Äôm devastated. I hate that the responsible decision has been my guiding principle in life. I hate myself for never taking a risk or betting on my own happiness. Tomorrow I‚Äôll schedule time with a counselor. But today? I‚Äôm mad. I‚Äôm sad. I can‚Äôt stop crying.

My marriage is ‚Äúfine I guess.‚Äù It hasn‚Äôt felt great for me for 10 years. She doesn‚Äôt challenge me. Doesn‚Äôt have the emotional vocabulary, or much capacity for self reflection. She doesn‚Äôt compete with me (in a healthy way) or rise to meet me. She just‚Ä¶ exists? Waits for me to meet her with some grand gesture. She says she‚Äôs content but how can she be when I‚Äôm fucking lonely as hell in my own marriage? Whatever. These are questions for the counselor. ",3,1752837447.0,adultery,4,0.71,False
1m2zlta,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m2zlta/mommy_he_says_hes_my_dad_mom_hugh_wants_to_call/,"Mommy, He Says He's My Dad_ Mom... Hugh wants to call off the wedding,"" she managed to say, her voice cracking before it gave way to quiet sobs.","# 1.Chapter 1 Call Off The Wedding

Melissa Bush stood in the middle of the crowded street, the noise around her barely registering over the chaos in her own head. Her phone buzzed, and when she saw her mom's name, she picked up like it was her last lifeline.

""Mom... Hugh wants to call off the wedding,"" she managed to say, her voice cracking before it gave way to quiet sobs.

""What?!"" Lillian Clayton's voice practically exploded through the phone. ""Melissa, are you serious? The wedding's tomorrow! What the hell happened?""

Every word Melissa forced out felt like tearing open a wound that refused to heal. ""The premarital medical report... it says I'm infertile.""

Her voice wavered, the last word almost choking her. ""But it might be a mistake! Mom, I swear, I never wanted his damn money. I even told him I'd sign a prenup! But he still‚Äî"" She cut off, unable to finish, the words catching in her throat.

Her thoughts spiraled, dragging her back to when she and Hugh had first fallen in love. Back in college, he'd been her everything‚Äîher rock. As soon as they graduated, he got down on one knee and promised her forever.

Sure, his family had looked down their noses at her modest background, but Hugh never let that shake him. He always made her feel like they were unbreakable.

She couldn't forget that awful summer during her junior year, after the car accident that forced her to take a break from school. The gossip had been brutal‚Äîpeople whispering that she was working shady jobs, or worse, selling herself to make ends meet. It had been hell.

But Hugh stood by her, brushing off the rumors like they were nothing, making it clear to everyone that he was with her, no matter what.

If it weren't for him, those disgusting accusations might've followed her forever.

She'd never had that growing up. Her parents' divorce left her with wounds she didn't even know how to name.

Her mom's fragile health and her stepdad's temper‚Äîfueled by booze‚Äîmade life feel like walking on eggshells every day.

He never cared for the family, only about where his next drink was coming from, and when he got angry, he made sure everyone in the house paid for it.

Marriage, to Melissa, wasn't just about love‚Äîit was her ticket to a better life. A safe haven. Not just for her, but for her mom too.

And now? Now she was being thrown away like yesterday's trash because she might not be able to have kids. In this so-called modern world, this was enough to undo everything she and Hugh had built.

The word infertile sent a shiver through Lillian, but she quickly swallowed her shock.

Her voice softened, steady but full of determination. ""Melissa, baby, stop crying. Just come home, okay? We'll figure this out. Together.""

Melissa nodded, even though her tears hadn't stopped. Her mom's voice was like a warm blanket around her frayed nerves, and for the first time all day, she felt a tiny sliver of hope.

At least she still had her mom.

Husband or no husband, Melissa wasn't about to let life chew her up and spit her out. If Hugh wanted out, fine. She'd pick herself up, find a job, and build her own life. She didn't need a savior. She'd be her own hero‚Äîand protect her mom in the process.

Melissa pushed open the beat-up door of her dingy little apartment, and the sour, unmistakable stink of alcohol hit her like a slap. She gagged, wrinkling her nose in disgust.

""Drunk again,"" she muttered under her breath, her voice heavy with exhaustion and resignation.

She moved quietly, her steps careful and deliberate, like she was trying to navigate a minefield. All she wanted was to sneak into her room without stirring up the hornet's nest.

""Hey! Don't you fucking move!"" The shout came like a whip crack, sharp and ice-cold, freezing her in place.

Her heart jumped into her throat as she slowly turned around, dread creeping up her spine.

Jack Walton, her stepfather was staggering toward her, weaving unsteadily, but still managing to look threatening as hell. ""So, it's true,"" he growled, his words slurred but still venomous. ""The Wallaker family broke off the damn engagement? What the fuck did you do this time, huh?""

Melissa's stomach churned. Her pulse hammered in her ears as she tried to find the right words to diffuse the situation. Arguing would only make things worse, but she couldn't figure out how she explained something like this.

""I... I need to talk to Mom,"" she stammered, her voice shaking as her eyes darted toward the half-open door of the master bedroom.

She caught a glimpse of Lillian's dress peeking through the crack, and hope surged in her chest. She edged toward the bedroom, desperate for escape. But escape wasn't in the cards.

She'd barely made it two steps when a sharp, searing pain ripped through her scalp. She cried out in shock as Jack's hand yanked her back by the hair.

""Don't you fucking walk away from me!"" he snarled, his grip like iron. ""Answer me, goddamn it! Why did the Wallakers call it off? What'd you do? What's your fucking excuse this time? You cheating on him, you little whore?""

The accusation hit her harder than the pull on her hair. Tears sprang to her eyes as anger and humiliation bubbled to the surface.

""No! That's not true!"" she cried, her voice cracking. ""I wasn't cheating! I was just delivering wedding invitations to my classmates!""

""Bullshit!"" he spat, his voice rising as his hand tightened. ""I saw you yesterday, laughing it up with some guy like you didn't have a care in the fucking world. Don't you dare lie to me!""

Melissa's whole body trembled as she tried to pull away, her voice trembling. ""It wasn't like that! I swear to God!""

He ignored her, his voice growing louder and nastier. ""You think I don't know you? You've been spreading your legs for any guy who looks at you twice! You think I'm blind? Jesus Christ, I actually thought you were trying to clean up your act, but no‚Äîsame old useless slut! After all I've done for you!

""And now, with the Wallakers out of the picture, you think you can just stay here for free? Hell no. You're gonna start pulling your weight.""

Before she could process his words, he grabbed the front of her shirt and ripped it down the middle.

Melissa gasped, crossing her arms over her chest instinctively. Her entire body shook with terror as she saw the look in his eyes now‚Äîhungry, predatory, disgusting.

""No!"" she screamed, thrashing as hard as she could. ""Mom! Mom, help me! Please!"" But the house stayed silent.

Jack laughed, low and mean. ""You really think she's coming to save you? She can hear you just fine, sweetheart. And if she ain't coming out, you already know why. Now, be a good girl, and maybe I won't throw you and your useless mother out on the street.""

Her blood ran cold. She twisted and fought with everything she had, her voice hoarse from screaming. ""Mom! Please! Help me! Mom!""

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught movement. Her mother‚ÄîLillian Clayton‚Äîwas standing in the doorway of the master bedroom, her pale face just visible through the crack.

For one brief, heart-stopping moment, their eyes met. Then the door closed. Softly. Quietly. Finally.

The sound shattered something inside Melissa. She stared at the door, her mind reeling with disbelief. Her chest ached as the betrayal washed over her.

The woman she had sacrificed so much for, fought so hard to protect, had abandoned her. Just like that.

Jack's weight bore down on her, his breath hot and foul against her skin.

Something inside her snapped. The fight drained out of her body, leaving her limp and hollow. Tears streamed down her face as she stared at the closed door, her heart breaking into pieces.

Jack's grin twisted into something vile as Melissa dissolved into despair. He pressed down harder, his weight like a crushing anchor, his hands fumbling clumsily with his belt.

The sour reek of alcohol poured off him, thick and nauseating, choking the air between them. Melissa gagged, bile rising in her throat. 'This isn't happening. It can't be real.' Her chest tightened, panic clawing at her insides.

She twisted her head, desperate for anything‚Äîany escape. That's when she saw it: a fruit knife, glinting innocuously on the coffee table just a few feet away.

Her trembling hand darted out, fingers curling around the cold, unforgiving metal. She gripped it tight, but the weight of the blade sent her mind spiraling.

Her stomach churned. She hated blood‚Äîhated violence. She couldn't even bring herself to kill a fly, and now she was supposed to stab someone? The thought made her hands freeze, the knife shaking in her grip.

But her stepfather wasn't waiting. His pants were already halfway down his legs, his drunken, clumsy hands yanking and pulling at her clothes.

Something snapped. Melissa let out a broken cry, her chest heaving as she clenched her teeth. Tears blurred her vision, but she didn't care. With a surge of blind, desperate fury, she raised the knife and drove it straight into his back.

""Ah, fuck!"" His scream ripped through the air. He reeled back, clutching at his back as blood seeped through his shirt. He staggered, his breath ragged, but the fury in his eyes only burned hotter.

""You little bitch!"" he snarled, his voice slurred and feral. ""You think this is gonna stop me?!"" He stumbled toward her, hands reaching, his face twisted into something monstrous.

Melissa scrambled to her feet, her whole body shaking like a leaf in the wind. The knife trembled in her hand, its weight unfamiliar and terrifying. ""Stay back!"" she screamed, her voice cracking. ""I swear to God, I'll use it again! Don't fucking come near me!""

But he didn't stop. He wasn't listening. ""You're dead, you hear me? You're fucking dead!"" he roared, spit flying from his lips as he lunged at her.

Melissa's breath hitched. Her legs felt like jelly, her heart pounding so hard it threatened to burst. She shut her eyes tight and thrust the knife forward, blind and wild.

This time, the blade struck true. It plunged into his chest with a sickening crunch. His body jerked, his breath catching in a horrible gurgle.

For a moment, his eyes locked on hers, wide with shock, before the fire drained out of them. He stumbled back, his knees buckling as his weight collapsed into itself. Then he hit the floor. Hard.

Melissa froze. She couldn't move, couldn't breathe. Her fingers went limp, the knife clattering to the floor beside her. The world around her blurred into nothing but the sight of his lifeless body, blood pooling dark and thick beneath him.

Then came the sound of a door slamming open. ""Melissa!"" Her mother's voice ripped through the stillness, sharp and panicked. Lillian stormed into the room, her eyes darting wildly between Melissa and the bloodied corpse on the floor. She marched straight to Melissa, snatched the knife from her hand, and flung it across the room.

""That's your stepfather, you stupid, ungrateful brat!"" Lillian screamed, pointing a trembling finger at the body. ""Do you have any idea what you've just done? He's the one who's kept a roof over our heads all these years! The one who's fed you! And you‚Äîwhat, you just fucking stab him?!""

Melissa stared at her, her cheek throbbing, her chest heaving. The words hit her harder than the slap. Her mother wasn't angry about what had almost happened. She wasn't furious about what he had done.

# 2.Chapter 2 Against The World

Melissa stared down at Jack's lifeless body sprawled on the floor. Blood had already seeped to the tips of her shoes, cold and sticky, clinging like guilt itself.

Her knees gave out, and she crumpled onto the floor, her hands trembling uncontrollably. ""Shit... I killed him. I fucking killed him...""

Melissa, pale as death, clutched at a stray piece of clothing to cover herself, her fingers fumbling like they didn't belong to her anymore. With a ragged breath, she stumbled to her feet, her legs shaky and unsteady.

All she could do was run‚Äîout of the house, out of the nightmare she couldn't wake up from.

By the time she reached the bridge, her body was moving, but her mind felt like it wasn't even there anymore. Everything around her was a blur, muted and distant, like she was trapped in someone else's bad dream.

Blood. His face. That awful, sickening finality. She knew it was only a matter of time. The cops were probably already out there, scouring the city, sirens blaring, her name crackling over their radios.

They'd catch her. Drag her into some courtroom where strangers would dissect her life, argue over whether she was a monster or just desperate.

Her eyes drifted to the river below. The water churned and rolled like it was waiting for her, dark and restless. One step. That's all it would take. 'One step, and it's all over,' she thought.

The guilt. The fear. The shame. The suffocating weight of it all. It would disappear the second she sank into the cold depths.

She climbed over the railing, her bare feet gripping the slick metal. Rain was starting to fall now, icy droplets running down her face and soaking her to the bone.

Until she heard it. A sound, faint and almost lost in the wind, but unmistakable. A cry.

Melissa's eyes snapped open. For a moment, she thought she'd imagined it. But then it came again‚Äîsoft, pitiful, barely audible through the pounding rain.

She turned her head, scanning the bridge. And there it was. A small bundle, not far away, lying forgotten and abandoned in the shadows. It was a baby.

""Waa... waa..."" The cry was weak, fragile, like it barely had the strength to keep going.

Melissa let out a sharp, bitter laugh. 'You've gotta be kidding me,' she muttered under her breath. 'What the hell are you crying about? No one's coming for you, kid. Just like no one's coming for me.'

But the sound of the baby's cries clawed at her, refusing to let go.

She tried to turn back toward the river, to focus on the plan she'd already made. But that tiny, helpless sound stuck to her like a curse. It wound itself around her chest, digging into places she didn't want to feel.

The rain came harder now, pouring in thick sheets, but the baby's cries grew fainter, as though it didn't have much left. Melissa gritted her teeth, her hands clutching the railing until her knuckles turned white.

""Fuck,"" she whispered under her breath. The curse slipped out like a prayer, desperate and raw. She let out a shaky sigh, then swung her legs back over the railing. Her body felt heavy as lead as she staggered toward the tiny bundle.

When she reached it, she dropped to her knees, her heart pounding against her ribs. The baby was so small, wrapped in a damp, dirty blanket, its face pale and cold. It wasn't crying anymore‚Äîjust making soft, fragile noises, like it didn't have the strength to do anything else.

Melissa hesitated, her hands shaking, before finally reaching out. She pulled the baby into her arms, holding it close. Tentatively, she pressed her finger to its lips, and the baby latched on, sucking weakly.

""You poor little thing,"" she murmured, her voice cracking. Tears welled up in her eyes, mixing with the rain streaming down her face. ""Thrown out like trash, huh? Just like me.""

The baby let go of her finger, its cries starting up again‚Äîsharp and desperate, cutting through the rain like a knife. Melissa's heart twisted painfully.

""You're hungry,"" she whispered, her voice breaking. ""I know, I know... I'll figure something out. Just don't give up, okay? Don't give up on me.""

The baby's cries softened a little, but its tiny body was still trembling, fragile and helpless in her arms. Melissa cradled it closer, pressing her cheek to its cold, damp forehead.

""We're both screwed, aren't we?"" she muttered bitterly, her lips twitching into the faintest hint of a smile. ""Left behind. Forgotten.""

'Alright,' she thought, standing on shaky legs. 'Guess we're in this together now. You and me against the world, huh? Let's see if we can make it out of this mess.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Three years later, in a sleepy little town in Lachlan, life trudged along quietly, tucked into the cracks of an old street.

In a shabby house, another chapter of a small, complicated life unfolded.

Melissa, wearing a slightly worn apron, leaned against the window frame. Her tone was firm but still gentle as she called down to the rowdy kids tearing up the yard below. ""Curtis! Dinner's on the table‚Äîget your little butt inside!""

Covered in dirt from head to toe, Curtis Bush looked like he'd just climbed out of a mud pit. His toy gun clutched tightly in one hand, he didn't bother looking up. ""Yeah, yeah, I heard you!"" he shouted, too caught up in his pretend war to care.

Melissa exhaled, shaking her head as she turned back into the kitchen. The plates clattered softly as she arranged them on the table. When the doorway stayed empty, her patience hit its limit.

She stormed out onto the balcony, her voice sharp enough to cut through the racket outside. ""Curtis Bush, I said now! Move it!""

The instant she used his full name, every kid in the yard froze. Full-name warnings from a mom meant only one thing: you were about two seconds away from real trouble.

Curtis let out a long, exaggerated sigh. ""Don't go anywhere,"" he said to his friends, sounding like a middle-aged man with too much on his plate. ""I'll eat fast and be back before you even notice I'm gone.""

That cracked the older boys up. They were doubled over, laughing so hard they could barely breathe. ""Curtis is such a little mama's boy!"" one of them howled. ""His mom calls, and he comes running like a scared little puppy!""

""Yeah, other kids are scared of their dads, but Curtis? He's terrified of his mom!""

""And he doesn't even have a dad!"" another chimed in, his voice dripping with mockery.

That hit different. Curtis, halfway to the stairs with a grin on his face, froze mid-step. His smile vanished, replaced by a look that was way too serious for a three-year-old. Slowly, he turned around, his small frame tense like a coiled spring.

""Shut the hell up!"" he yelled, gripping his toy gun so tight his knuckles turned white. ""Don't you dare talk about my mom like that!""

The biggest boy in the group crossed his arms, smirking. He was older, taller, and clearly used to being the boss. ""Or what? Everyone knows your dad ditched you. He's never shown up‚Äînot once.""

Another boy snickered, piling on. ""Yeah, and what about that creepy guy down the street? Didn't he say he'd marry your mom? Maybe you should start calling him daddy.""

Curtis might've been little, but he wasn't stupid. He could hear the venom behind their words. This wasn't teasing‚Äîit was mean, deliberate, and aimed straight at his heart. His face turned bright red, his whole body shaking with anger.

""You call him daddy! You and your whole family can call him daddy!"" Curtis snapped, his voice cracking.

That just made them laugh harder. ""Why would we? We already have dads,"" one of them shot back, his tone cruel. ""You're the one who doesn't. We were being nice, and now you're acting like a little brat. Maybe your mom does like the lame guy down the street. Maybe she's just waiting to say yes!""

Before Curtis could respond, a new voice cut through the laughter‚Äîcold and sharp, like the crack of a whip. ""And what exactly makes you little assholes think you're so special? A bunch of nasty brats with no manners, running your mouths like you own the place. Pathetic.""

The boys whipped around to see Melissa standing at the top of the stairs, her face like thunder. In one hand, she gripped a broom, and she didn't hesitate.

She charged down into the yard, swinging it like she was clearing out pests. The boys scattered, tripping over their own feet as they bolted.

Once the yard was clear, Melissa scooped Curtis up in her arms. But even as she stepped inside, the sound of gossip drifted through the thin walls of the neighborhood.

""She's got some damn nerve, acting all high and mighty,"" someone muttered loud enough to be heard. ""Everyone knows she doesn't even know who the kid's dad is. Bringing their mess here like it's not a disgrace.""

Melissa's jaw clenched so hard it hurt. But her grip on Curtis didn't falter, and her pace didn't slow. She refused to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Back inside, she set Curtis down, finally noticing the way his lip was trembling and his little hands were clenched into fists. He wasn't crying, but his face was pale, and his big eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She knelt in front of him, resting her hands on his shoulders. ""Hey,"" she said softly, her voice steady even though her heart was breaking. ""my little guy, no tears, okay? We didn't do anything wrong. You hear me? Nothing. So don't you cry.""

Curtis hiccupped through his sobs, his little shoulders trembling. ""Mom...I just... I wish Dad was still here..."" His voice broke as he dissolved into hiccupping sobs.

The words hit her like a freight train. Melissa fought to keep the sharp sting of pain off her face. She'd worked so hard to keep Curtis from thinking about the man she was so desperate to forget.

It had been years since she'd grabbed her baby and run, fleeing to Lachlan, the middle of nowhere, to escape a life she could never go back to.

She'd spun a careful story, telling Curtis that his dad was a truck driver who'd died in an accident shortly after they were married. A clean, simple lie to keep him from asking questions that could lead to answers too dangerous to speak out loud.

Melissa hugged him closer, her voice steady despite the lump in her throat. ""Baby, your daddy's watching over us from heaven. He loves you so much, Curtis, and he wouldn't want to see you sad like this. Okay?""

Curtis sniffled and nodded, his wide, tear-filled eyes searching hers. ""I don't want Daddy to be sad...""

Her heart twisted again, but before she could say more, a car horn cut through the heavy quiet outside.

Normally, Curtis would've been off her lap in a flash, rushing to the balcony to see what kind of car it was. He was obsessed with cars‚Äîhe could pick out makes and models just from the sound of an engine.

But today, he stayed put, burrowing deeper into her arms.

Melissa forced a smile and kissed the top of his head. ""Come on, buddy. Let's go see what's out there, huh? Maybe it's something cool.""

She stood and carried him to the balcony. Her eyes instantly locked on two sleek black sedans sitting in her dusty front yard.

Her stomach sank when she caught sight of the license plates‚ÄîChassis. A city miles away, too far for this to be a casual visit.

Her mind started racing. She hadn't seen a car from Chassis in years. Memories she'd buried long ago surged to the surface: the blood pooling on the floor, her stepfather's cold, lifeless body.

'Why now? Why here? Have they finally caught up with me?' she thought in a picnic.

Melissa's grip on Curtis tightened as dread washed over her. Back then, she'd had nothing to lose, no one to protect but herself.

But now, everything was different. She had Curtis. The thought of leaving him behind, of him facing this cruel world without her, was unbearable.

Her instinct screamed at her to retreat, to grab her boy and run again, but before she could so much as step back, the rear door of one of the sedans creaked open.

And out stepped a man. Melissa froze.

The summer heat shimmered around him, but he looked utterly untouched by it, his crisp, tailored suit clinging to his broad shoulders and lean frame like it was made for him.

His every movement was smooth, deliberate, exuding an effortless confidence that couldn't be faked. He wasn't just handsome; he was devastating.

He paused to adjust his cuffs with a deliberate, practiced ease before lifting his head. His eyes swept across the balcony. And then his gaze locked on her.

Melissa felt her breath hitch. His eyes were cold and unnervingly sharp, like he could see right through her.

# 3.Chapter 3 Got Moore Blood In You

Melissa bolted back into the house from the balcony, her movements sharp and hurried. ""Curtis, wash up‚Äîit's dinner time,"" she called, keeping her tone as steady as she could manage.

But her mind was miles away. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't shake the image of that car's license plate or the unnervingly intense stare of the man behind the wheel. A prickly, unfamiliar unease coiled in her gut, refusing to let go.

The knock at the door came suddenly, loud and aggressive, making her flinch. Her pulse skyrocketed, a cold sweat breaking out along her spine.

For a moment, she just stood there, frozen, her breathing shallow. Relax, she told herself, even as her hand shook slightly when she reached for the doorknob.

She opened the door‚Äîand there he was. The man from the car.

Tall and broad-shouldered, he filled the doorway with an imposing presence that made her instinctively want to step back. His cologne hit her first‚Äîsubtle, expensive, and irritatingly familiar.

It stirred a memory she couldn't quite place, like a ghost brushing past her. Her stomach tightened. She didn't know him. She was sure of that.

But there was something about the way he stood, so calm and self-assured, like he owned the damn world, that sent a chill rippling through her.

Melissa gripped the doorframe for support and forced herself to speak. ""Can I help you? Are you... looking for someone?""

The man's eyes locked onto hers, steady and unyielding. ""Yeah,"" he said, his voice low and deliberate. ""You.""

That single word knocked the air out of her lungs. She blinked, trying to gather her thoughts, her grip tightening. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said quickly, her voice a little too high-pitched to sound convincing.

His lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. ""No, I don't. Melissa Bush. Don't tell me you've forgotten what you did three years ago.""

Her heart stopped. Just like that, her world tipped on its axis. Three years ago. The words crashed into her like a truck, dredging up memories she'd fought so hard to bury.

Her eyes darted toward the living room, toward Curtis's toys scattered on the floor. 'If he knows...' Her chest tightened painfully. 'If they take me... Curtis. What happens to him?'

Her hands trembled at the thought. The idea of her little boy being ripped from her, tossed into foster care, growing up alone‚Äîit was unbearable.

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" she said, but her voice cracked halfway through. Her pale face and shaking hands told a different story.

The man, Bradley Moore, rolled his eyes, his patience clearly nonexistent. ""Cut the bullshit,"" he said, his tone sharp enough to slice through her weak protest.

Before she could respond, he shoved the door open, brushing past her like it was his house, not hers.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Melissa snapped, scrambling to block his path. ""Get out! You can't just barge into someone's house!""

He ignored her completely. His sharp eyes swept over the modest living room, taking in every detail.

The mismatched furniture, the small dining table with two steaming plates, the bookshelf crammed with kids' books‚Äîit all painted a picture of a simple, quiet life.

His gaze landed on the toy bin overflowing with blocks and stuffed animals. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.

Without a word, he strolled to the couch and sank into it like he owned the thing, one arm casually slung over the backrest. He patted the seat next to him, raising an eyebrow. ""Sit.""

Melissa bristled, her jaw tightening as she stood frozen by the door. She didn't move. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said again, her voice cold but tight with unease. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees, his gaze locked on her like a predator sizing up prey. ""Three years,"" he said slowly, his tone almost conversational. ""It took me three goddamn years to find you. You think I'm leaving without what's mine?""

Melissa's face twisted in a mix of confusion and disbelief as her thoughts tumbled over each other. ""What's mine? What the hell does he mean? Wait a second‚Äîhe's not a cop? He didn't come here to bust me?'

The whirlwind of questions sparked an unexpected surge of boldness, and before she could think twice, the words flew out of her mouth. ""What the hell are you even talking about? I don't know you, I've never seen you before in my life!""

His expression darkened, and the air in the room seemed to drop a few degrees. ""Give me back my son.""

The words hit like a sledgehammer. For a second, Melissa forgot how to breathe. She staggered back, her hand gripping the edge of the dining table for support.

""Your... son?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley's patience had clearly hit its limit. He turned, motioning toward the bathroom door where a pair of curious little eyes peeked through the crack. ""Milton, come here.""

Melissa could only watch, frozen, as the door creaked open and Curtis stepped out hesitantly. A cold, paralyzing fear gripped her chest.

There was something undeniable between this man and her son‚Äîsome unspoken, invisible link she couldn't ignore.

Curtis shuffled over to her, his tiny hand clutching the hem of her shirt like a lifeline. ""Mommy, who's that man?""

Melissa pulled him close, holding him tight against her. Her gaze never left Bradley, every fiber of her being screaming caution.

'But... hadn't Curtis been abandoned as a baby? Wasn't there a note in his blanket‚Äî'We can't afford to raise him'‚Äîa cold, heartless explanation for why he'd been left behind?' she mused internally.

And yet, here stood this man, driving a car worth more than most people's houses. He didn't look like someone who couldn't afford a pack of diapers.

More than that, his whole presence, his every movement, oozed wealth and sophistication. That wasn't something you could fake, let alone pick up in a couple of years.

Melissa hadn't even managed to come up with a lie to soothe Curtis when Bradley's voice cut through the tension. ""I'm your father.""

The words landed like a punch to the gut. She'd had her suspicions, sure‚Äîbut hearing him say it out loud? It knocked the air out of her lungs. Her knees wobbled, and she nearly hit the floor.

Her body shook uncontrollably, trembling like a leaf caught in a storm.

On paper, she was the one who had saved Curtis when he was abandoned as a baby. But in truth, he'd been the one keeping her alive all these years, the reason she fought so hard just to survive.

Melissa opened her mouth, but no words came out. All she could do was hold Curtis tighter, as though sheer force could shield him from whatever was coming.

""You're my dad?"" Curtis's eyes sparkled with cautious excitement, his voice full of innocent curiosity.

Bradley's lips curved into the slightest smile, clearly satisfied with the reaction. ""That's right.""

Curtis tilted his head, studying the man as if trying to solve a puzzle. Finally, he blurted out, ""But... aren't you supposed to be dead?""

Bradley's brow twitched slightly. His gaze flicked toward Melissa, who stood frozen like a statue. Then he turned back to Curtis. ""What else did she tell you?""

Curtis's little fingers began counting as he answered earnestly, ""She said you're a super good driver, you can cook, and... you love her a lot!""

Bradley's lips curled into a sharp, mocking smile. ""Take all the time you need,"" he drawled, his tone cool and cutting. ""You'll figure out soon enough what kind of man your father really is.""

His words hit like a slap. Curtis, wide-eyed and hesitant, turned to Melissa, his voice trembling with confusion. ""Mommy... is he really my daddy? He's alive?""

Melissa froze, panic overtaking her. She shook her head so hard it was a wonder it didn't come loose. ""No, no, he's not‚Äîhe's not your daddy!""

Bradley's expression darkened in an instant, the air in the room seeming to drop several degrees. His voice was icy and sharp. ""So, not only are you a thief, but you're a liar too?""

Melissa's shaking grew worse. She looked small, fragile, as she stumbled over her words. ""No, no... it's not like that... I didn't steal... he's mine...""

Her voice broke, and tears brimmed in her eyes. She looked so small, so helpless, that Curtis's chest tightened. This wasn't the mommy he knew‚Äîthe strong, loving, sometimes stern mommy who always had everything under control. Right now, she looked broken.

Something clicked in Curtis's young mind. This man‚Äîthis tall, scary man with his harsh words and cruel eyes‚Äîhad to be a bad guy.

With sudden determination, Curtis stepped forward, planting his small body in front of Melissa. He threw his arms out as wide as they would go and glared up at Bradley. ""You're a bad man!"" he shouted, his voice shaking but firm. ""You're not my daddy! Get out of my house!""

Bradley's eyes narrowed, his irritation flashing like lightning. His voice turned sharper, louder. ""Ungrateful little brat! Protecting an outsider? I'm your father, whether you like it or not.""

Curtis flinched but didn't back down. His little jaw tightened as he stomped over to the corner, grabbing his toy gun.

Though his hands trembled, he aimed it straight at Bradley, his face set in childish defiance. ""You're lying! You're a bad man, and you can't hurt my mommy! Get out, or‚Äîor I'll shoot you!""

Bradley blinked, startled for a split second, before a deep laugh rumbled from his chest. ""Well, well,"" he said, amusement flickering in his cold eyes. ""At least you've got some Moore blood in you.""

For a moment, Curtis faltered, lowering the toy gun slightly. That hesitation was all Bradley needed. In one swift move, he reached out, grabbed the toy gun from Curtis's hands, and tossed it aside without a second thought.

His smirk vanished as his voice turned razor-sharp. ""Enough of this bullshit."" Snapping his fingers, he signaled to the two men waiting just outside the door. ""Take them.""

Chaos erupted instantly. Before Melissa could react, Bradley scooped Curtis up in one arm, his grip unyielding.

The two large men stormed in, each grabbing one of Melissa's arms and lifting her off the ground like she weighed nothing.

The room filled with frantic screams.

""Curtis!"" Melissa cried, her voice raw with desperation.

""Mommy! Mommy, I want my mommy!"" Curtis yelled, his small fists pounding against Bradley's chest.

Tears streamed down Curtis's face as he fought with everything he had, but Bradley's hold was like steel. Desperation surged in him, and with no other option, he sank his teeth into Bradley's neck, biting down as hard as he could.

# 4.Chapter 4 She's Not Your Mother

""Hiss‚Äî"" Bradley winced in pain, his gaze turning sharp as a knife. ""You little brat, is this how she's been teaching you?""

Curtis glared at him, fists clenched in fury. ""You're not my dad! Let go of me!""

Bradley's voice hardened, low and threatening. ""Listen up, Milton Moore. I'm your real father. That woman? She's not your mother!""

The words hit Curtis like a punch to the gut. He completely lost it, thrashing wildly, kicking and screaming. ""Liar! She is my mom! Let go of me, you bastard!""

'How could she not be my mother?' Curtis's panic surged, his cries becoming even louder, more desperate.

Bradley, completely losing his patience, gripped the bloodstained spot on his neck and pulled Curtis in even tighter.

Outside, a luxury car stood parked in the driveway. The noise upstairs was enough to draw a crowd, and soon, the yard was full of nosy neighbors, whispering and gossiping.

Curtis was shoved into one car, while Melissa was taken to another.

An elderly woman, watching the chaos unfold, finally gathered the courage to speak. ""Who the hell are you people? You can't just steal people like this... it's illegal!""

Bradley remained unfazed, casually pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the blood from his neck. ""I'm working a case. Mind your own business.""

The crowd quickly pieced it together, and whispers spread like wildfire.

""No wonder no one ever visits them. They must be hiding out because they're running from the law.""

""Oh my God, my kid's always hanging out with that troublemaker. I hope he doesn't get dragged into something bad.""

The crowd muttered, pointing at Melissa, who was banging on the car window, fighting to break free.

The car tore off, kicking up dust as it sped away.

After what felt like forever, Melissa, exhausted from crying, realized there was no way out. She stopped, her sobs turning into quiet sniffles.

Her red, swollen eyes narrowed at Bradley. ""Pretending to be a cop? That's a crime.""

Bradley Moore turned to her with a smirk, his tone teasing. ""When did I say I was a cop?""

Melissa shot back, biting with anger. ""You said you were working a case!""

Bradley chuckled darkly. ""What, a private investigator can't investigate a case?""

Melissa was left speechless, caught off guard.

Bradley pulled out an iPad, swiping it to pull up her information. ""Melissa Bush. Graduated from Chassis University. You were supposed to marry your boyfriend, but canceled the wedding the day before.""

He gave her a mocking smile. ""The media even covered it for a couple of days.""

Melissa looked at the screen, her nerves suddenly shot to hell.

It was obvious that Bradley hadn't dug deep enough into her past. If he had, he would've known the one thing that kept her up at night: the murder of her stepfather.

That secret was enough to bring her to her knees.

Melissa took a deep breath, her voice tight. ""What the hell do you want from me?""

Bradley's eyes were as cold as ice. ""Can't you figure it out? I want you to bring my son back and, while you're at it, I need you to tell me what the hell you've been doing all this time.""

Melissa fought to keep her composure. ""Are you seriously Curtis's real father?""

""He's Milton Moore!"" Bradley snapped, his tone sharp.

Melissa raised an eyebrow. ""And why the hell should I believe you?""

Bradley's voice dropped to a chilling, flat tone. ""We'll do a DNA test. You can take one too, if it makes you feel better.""

Melissa's heart skipped a beat. She knew well she wasn't related to Curtis by blood, and there was no way she was going near a DNA test.",1,1752837433.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

However my favorite has to be the mocha coffee flavor. I also got a 3 back of the protein coffee. I think I found my new favorite thing. I drink a shake for breakfast, oats overnight for lunch and have a small dinner. I have my shake at 7am, lunch between 11am & noon, dinner at 4pm. And try not to eat after 6pm. The oats have 20g protein. You just pour in any choice of milk to the spoon or sip line. Let sit in the fridge over night, then enjoy. If you‚Äôre already using oo what‚Äôs your favorite flavor?

1m2zkay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1m2zkay/i_finally_met_my_crush_but_it_went_wrong/,I finally met my crush but it went wrong,"I have liked a colleague of mine for one and an half months. He doesn't work exactly at our department but comes to few meetings here and there. From the first time I saw him I felt this strong attraction, both emotionally and physically. He seemed warm, open, kind.  I developed a crush for limerence as few people call it.

I finally took up the courage to add him on facebook and ask him out for a coffee and he said yes. I met him last Saturday and i was so excited. The conversation was going well when he said he had never been in a relationship and that he is avoidant. (He is also a psychologist), he also mentions he doesn't like the responsibility that comes with having kids and showed me a tattoo of him where it was written ""Leave me Alone"". Then he mentions he has ADHD and that he is gay. Also he is moving to another city by December for maybe next year.

I was so shocked and disappointed by all that. The image I had of him shattered. He saw me being surprised by him saying he was gay and told me he thought it was obvious and I said I didn't see that and that I liked him romantically. He said he felt guilty, and I could see at that point that he showed compassion. He said I was a pretty woman and that had he not been gay, he would have dated me. By the end of the meeting he gave me a hug and left. I saw him at work and he didn't say anything to me and haven't texted me since.

A part of me is grieving, specially that the mental image I had of him when I was in limerence is not there anymore. He never existed. A part of me wants him to text me, but also I wish I never saw him again so I could move on. I have been feeling so down and sad and disappointed. He hasn't texted me since we went out, and he saw me at work at a meeting and didn't talk to me.",2,1752837294.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Mr. Fleming, please, take it easy..."" On her birthday, Celeste Rodriguez witnessed her husband, Trevor Fleming, kissing another woman deeply, his hand relentlessly moving under the woman's skirt.  
Standing outside the office, overhearing this scene, Celeste's eyes filled with tears, her face pale with shock. She had loved this man for seven years, loving him so much that she gave up her career, abandoned her dreams, and wasted the best years of her life. This time, she decided to let go...

After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman‚Äîeven our daughter wanted her as her new mom.  
I scoffed at the years I‚Äôd wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,  
‚ÄúDivorce? Not a chance.‚Äù  
\*\*\*  
When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends‚Äîbut not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn‚Äôt back yet. Miss Jordyn‚Äôs upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I‚Äôm busy.""  
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste‚Äôs throat tightened. Jordyn didn‚Äôt look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow‚Äî""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo‚Ä¶ Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don‚Äôt talk, Look, I messed up the bead order‚Äî""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he‚Äôs busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow‚Äî""  
A woman‚Äôs voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he‚Äôd always been cold. Distant. Impatient.  
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn‚Äôt bother.  
Perhaps she was just too tired.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn‚Äôt just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn‚Äôt answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What‚Äôs up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No ‚ÄúHappy birthday.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She‚Äôs always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That‚Äôs hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn‚Äôt even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she‚Äôd brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.  
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch‚Äôs canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should‚Äôve known. Trevor always canceled on her. His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she‚Äôd cry. Today, she just felt‚Ä¶ empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.

Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream‚Äîbut he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming‚Äôs pressure, he never would‚Äôve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo‚Äîher only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn‚Äôt seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done‚Äîwith the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind‚Äîand reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she‚Äôd been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.‚ÄúThat offer still stand?‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm in.‚Äù  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt‚Äîshe had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.  
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
‚Ä¶  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
‚Ä¶  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
‚Ä¶  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
‚Ä¶  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.  
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to‚Äîit must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.  
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing‚Äî""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
‚Ä¶  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day‚Äîonce at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.  
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.  
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
‚Ä¶  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean‚Ä¶"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
‚Ä¶  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.  
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty‚ÄîCeleste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.  
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.  
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""

That‚Äôs what I said. Or something like it.
Knowing me, it was probably louder, meaner. I probably slammed the steering wheel for good measure, like the train would care.

I like to imagine I said something more poetic when it all began. Something that would sound good carved on a headstone, or at least look good on a screen if anyone ever finds this post. Something like ‚ÄúAnd so began the night that never ended.‚Äù But I doubt I did. I probably just sat there, muttering curses at a freight train that had no business being that long.

Funny, the things you remember and the things you don‚Äôt.
But that‚Äôs how it started. Just a guy in a car, waiting at a crossing for a train to pass. Nothing dramatic. Nothing special. Until it was.

I‚Äôve been stuck in this‚Ä¶ whatever you want to call it‚Ä¶ for‚Äî
I don‚Äôt even know how long anymore. The clock on my dashboard froze at 11:48 p.m. the first night. Or what I think was night. It still is now. Same rain sliding down the windshield like it‚Äôs been looping on repeat. Same train, rattling along those tracks.

And me? I‚Äôve gone from cursing to begging to just‚Ä¶ talking into this little screen like someone might actually read this someday. So, yeah. If you‚Äôre reading this, congratulations. You‚Äôre on the outside. Keep it that way.

Because in here‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no outside. There‚Äôs only the train.

---

You probably want to know why I was out there that night. Why I left the city, drove two hours through pouring rain for a family dinner that I could've skipped with a simple text.

Truth? I wanted to make things right. Really make things right this time.

Not just to look better. Not to show up, smile, and let them think I was on the straight and narrow just long enough for them to slip me a helping hand‚Äîa few bucks to get me through a ‚Äúrough patch‚Äù‚Äîbefore I disappeared again, crawling back into the same old cycle. I‚Äôve done that before. Too many times.

But this time was different. I wasn‚Äôt chasing a bailout. I wasn‚Äôt looking for pity. I wanted to stand there and make them believe me when I said I‚Äôd changed‚Äîbecause I had to. Because if I didn‚Äôt, I wasn‚Äôt just going to lose them for good. I was going to lose myself for good.

Sarah wasn‚Äôt just my sister growing up‚Äîshe was my best friend. Back when the world was small and safe, when the biggest fight we had was over who got the last Pop-Tart. We shared everything‚Äîsecrets whispered in the dark, dumb inside jokes no one else would ever get.

And I loved her. God, I loved her. Always did. I just never knew how to show it.
My way of saying I care was‚Ä¶ well, it was kid stuff. Switching the sugar in her cereal for salt. Stealing her diary so she‚Äôd chase me down the hall. Acting like an asshole when she brought home her first boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do with the feeling that she might matter to someone else more than she did to me.

That was me. All swagger and no clue how to love without screwing it up.

And then I got older, and the stakes got higher. The drinking started‚Äîjust a few beers to take the edge off, right? Then more. Then pills when the booze didn‚Äôt cut it. Before long, I was spiraling and lying to everyone about how fine I was, while Sarah kept showing up. Kept calling. Kept saying You‚Äôre not alone in this.

And every time she did, I hated myself more. Because I wanted to be better, but I didn‚Äôt want to need saving. I didn‚Äôt want to sit there with Mom looking at me like she‚Äôd failed somehow, or Dad trying to fix things with his tight-lipped silence, like if he didn‚Äôt talk about it, it might just go away.

I love them too‚ÄîMom with her casseroles and worried eyes, Dad with his hard hands and harder opinions‚Äîbut every time I saw them, all I felt was shame. Like they were taking turns holding up a mirror I didn‚Äôt want to look into.

And the more they tried to help, the worse it got. Every phone call, every quiet intervention, every ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here for you‚Äù‚Äîit all just made me sink deeper. Because the more they cared, the smaller I felt. The smaller I felt, the more I drank. The more I drank, the more they cared. Round and round it went, until it wasn‚Äôt love anymore, not to me. It was a noose. A loop I couldn‚Äôt break.

Sounds familiar now. A track with no crossing, running circles around me.

But this time‚Ä¶ this time was different.
I‚Äôd hit bottom hard a few weeks back. Hard enough to scare me sober. Hard enough to make me crawl out by my fingernails and swear I was done for good. For once, I wasn‚Äôt lying‚Äînot to them, not to myself. I was clean. Fragile, yeah. But clean. And I thought maybe, just maybe, I could make them believe in me again.

Especially Sarah.

---

So I drove down. Had dinner with Sarah and Mark‚Äîthe guy I‚Äôve barely spoken to since their wedding. Mom was there too, filling the kitchen with the smell of roast and cinnamon, just like when we were kids. The house hadn‚Äôt changed much. It was the one we grew up in, the one Dad left us when he passed. Sarah bought out my half after the funeral, and I told myself I‚Äôd use the money to start fresh. Instead, I burned through most of it on pills and powder, chasing numbness.

It was awkward at first, sure. All the smiles a little too tight, the jokes a little forced. But somewhere between the second round of coffee and Mom bringing out her famous apple crumble, the edges softened. We started laughing for real. Talking for real.

And for a while‚Äîjust a little while‚Äîit felt like stepping back in time. Back before the drinking. Before the late-night phone calls and slammed doors. Back before the divorce. Back before Dad was gone for good. Just a family at the table, like nothing had ever cracked or broken.

Sarah was different, too. She didn‚Äôt say anything outright‚Äîshe never does‚Äîbut it was in the way she looked at me. Like maybe she believed me this time. Like maybe she felt the change before I even said a word about it.

And I felt it too. That quiet thread between us that used to be unbreakable, humming again. Stronger. I thought, this is it. This is the turning point. This time, I‚Äôm going to make it.

We didn‚Äôt talk about the past. Didn‚Äôt need to. Sometimes silence says more than all the words in the world.

When I left, she hugged me tight. Longer than she had in years. And I drove off thinking‚Äîfor the first time in forever‚Äîthat maybe the ground under me was finally solid.

Just a drive home.
Just a guy with a second chance, heading down a dark road, rain spitting on the windshield.

And then I stopped at those goddamn blinking red lights.

---

I sat there, watching them strobe against the rain-slicked road, painting everything in angry red. The crossing arms were already down when I rolled up, and the train was already thundering by‚Äîboxcar after boxcar, hissing and clanging through the dark.

At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Just another train on another cold night. I drummed the wheel, scrolled through my playlists, tried to pretend the seconds weren‚Äôt stretching like rubber bands.

But they were.
Still going.
Boxcar after boxcar. No break in the line, just freight, rolling on and on like it had no place better to be.

That‚Äôs when the itch started. The one in the base of my skull. I‚Äôve never been good at waiting. Not when there‚Äôs another option. Even a bad one.

So I threw it in drive, swung a U-turn, and headed for the back roads.

I knew these streets like the lines on my palm. Grew up out here, cutting through gravel lanes and narrow curves to shave five minutes off a bike ride. I figured I could chase the tail of the train, maybe find a crossing past the last car. Wouldn‚Äôt save me any real time, but at least I‚Äôd be moving. At least I‚Äôd feel like I had some control.

That was the plan. Just a little detour. Nothing more.

The road curved through dark fields, slick with rain, my wipers thudding slow against the glass. I told myself the next crossing couldn‚Äôt be far. The tail of the train had to be close by now.

I turned onto County Road 7, tires hissing over puddles, and then‚Äîthere it was.
A smear of red in the distance, pulsing through the trees like a warning heartbeat.

The lights. Still flashing.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù I muttered, slamming my palm against the wheel. I hit the brakes hard, felt the car skid a little before it caught. My jaw clenched. Screw this.

I threw it in reverse, cranking the wheel sharp until I was nosed back toward the main road. Gravel spat out behind me as I punched the gas and swung into an adjacent street, heading for the third crossing I knew was out past Miller‚Äôs Creek. A long shot, but at least it was something.

It was further than I remembered. Roads darker, narrower. The rain tapped steady against the glass as I wound through tight curves, headlights carving pale ribbons through the wet night.

By the time I saw the crossing ahead, my shoulders were knotted tight, and my teeth hurt from grinding them.

And then I saw it.
Those same red lights, glowing like the gates of hell, cutting through the dark.

Still blocked. Still going.

I pulled up close this time, killed the engine, let the wipers freeze mid-swipe. The train roared by, boxcars hammering the night. No end. No break. Just iron rolling forever.

Fine. Bite the bullet. Wait it out.

I sat back, exhaled hard, and finally let myself check the dash clock.
11:48.

My chest tightened. The numbers sat there, sharp and green, like they were carved into the screen. 11:48. Same as when I first hit the lights.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù

I slapped the plastic with my palm, harder than I meant to. The green digits flickered for a second, then settled right back into place. 11:48.

It made me think of Dad, back in his chair years ago, giving the old TV a quick tap on the side whenever the picture went fuzzy. Not a hard hit‚Äîjust enough to make the static clear and the world snap back into focus. Somehow, it always worked for him.

Not this time.

For a second, I thought maybe I‚Äôd misremembered. Maybe I‚Äôd had a few too many drinks and time slipped past me without me noticing. God knows that‚Äôs happened before.

But then it hit me. I don‚Äôt drink anymore. Haven‚Äôt in weeks. Haven‚Äôt touched a drop since the last time I swore I was done.

So why the hell was it still 11:48?

I pulled my phone from my jacket, thumbed it awake, the glow harsh in the dark car.

11:48.

I opened up social.

Posts slid past under my thumb: video of a dog in a Halloween costume, someone‚Äôs new kitchen backsplash, a guy from high school humblebragging about his second rental property. Normal stuff. Comfortable stuff.

I kept scrolling. And scrolling.

After a while, the feed thinned out. Fewer posts, longer gaps. Then the spinning wheel, the little refresh chirp‚Äî
and nothing.

You‚Äôve reached the end.

Huh.

I hit refresh. The screen blinked, then snapped back to where I‚Äôd started. Same golden retriever in a bumblebee suit. Same backsplash. Same rental property.

I frowned, flicked through again. Same thing. Again and again, like the whole world froze mid-scroll.

Signal bars were solid. Wi-Fi off. Data fine. Everything fine‚Äî
except nothing was changing.
Although the dog was cute, I grew tired of the same feed. And that realtor‚Äôs fake smile was starting to get under my skin. I locked the screen, slid the phone back into my pocket.

Screw it. I‚Äôd just double back to my sister‚Äôs place. Spend another half hour there before I tried the road again. Might as well.

I swung the car around and headed back the way I‚Äôd come. The rain whispered against the glass as I let myself drift down the old roads, the ones I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. A little trip through memory lane.

---

The park came first‚Äîthe one with the crooked slide and rusted swing set. I slowed as I passed, staring through the wet blur at the dark silhouette of the jungle gym.

God, I hadn‚Äôt thought about that day in forever‚Äîme and Kyle, two idiots lying on the grass behind the equipment, trying mushrooms for the first time. I remembered stretching my hand out in front of my face, feeling the breeze against my palm every time I exhaled. Something so small, so ordinary, felt‚Ä¶ incredible. Like proof I could make something happen, even if it was just moving the air.

We laughed until our ribs ached.

The road curved, pulling me past a neighborhood I used to know too well. I slowed a little, watching rows of dark houses blur through the rain.

Back then, I used to sneak into this place with people I called friends. We‚Äôd slip through the shadows, testing car doors, whispering like we were in some high-stakes heist instead of a couple of dumb kids in hoodies.

GPS units, loose change, the odd phone charger‚Äîwhatever we could find. The plan was always the same: sell it all at school, make a quick buck, live large.

We never sold a single thing. Just ended up with glove-box junk rattling around under our beds like trophies.

Funny how quick you convince yourself it‚Äôs harmless. No one gets hurt. Everybody does it.

---

I pulled into the driveway. All the lights were off inside the house. No big deal. It was late‚Äîthey were probably asleep by now.

I was about to throw it in reverse when my headlights slid across the car in the driveway.

I froze.

The beams crawled over metal that didn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîpitted, eaten through in patches like it had been sitting out for decades. The tires sagged flat, splitting at the seams. Rust bled across the doors like rot.

For a second, I wondered if I‚Äôd pulled into the wrong place. My stomach knotted as I checked the address on the house.

It was my childhood home. No doubt about it.

The white paint I‚Äôd seen not too long ago was curling away in strips, exposing gray, splintered wood beneath. Shingles sagged like loose scabs, some torn off entirely, leaving the roof raw and jagged.

I shoved the gear into park and stepped out.

The air smelled like wet earth‚Äîand something else. Something stale.

I moved around the front of the car, headlights throwing my shadow long across the yard. That‚Äôs when I saw the grass. It reached almost to my knees in places, bending heavy with water. Thick, tangled, and wild, like nobody had touched it in months.

A busted flowerpot lay by the steps, soil spilled out and washed thin. The welcome mat was still there, but its edges had curled and frayed, the lettering faded to a ghost of a word.

My stomach turned as I climbed the steps, each board groaning under my weight.

The door wasn‚Äôt locked. It gave under my hand with a tired sigh.

That‚Äôs when the smell hit me.

Rot and mildew, thick enough to coat the back of my throat. It felt alive, like the house was breathing it at me, pushing it into my lungs.

I stepped inside, the floor soft under my shoes, like the boards had been drinking the damp for years.

I moved farther in, the beam from the headlights slicing through the living room just enough to show shapes. The couch hunched under a film of gray, cushions sagging, fabric split along the seams.

Then I saw the table.

It was still set for dinner. Plates, glasses, silverware‚Äîall where we‚Äôd left them. Except now, the food was drowned in a shallow pool of murky water. The potatoes had shriveled to hard, wrinkled husks, their skin splitting like old parchment. Scattered across the table were chunks of meat, or what was left of them‚Äîrotting away in a state of quiet decay. A slick pinkish slime clung to the surface, dripping in slow threads down the edges of the plates, pooling on the table like diluted blood.

Maggots writhed in pale clusters, burrowing through soft tissue, shifting the meat as if feeding it life. From above came the faint, rhythmic patter of water trickling through the roof, each drop carving tiny craters into the dusty surface before spreading into the stagnant puddle below.

A drowned candle leaned against the edge of a cracked plate. Dust clung to everything like frost, soft and heavy. The warm scent of sweet cinnamon that once filled the room was gone, replaced by the musty stench of damp rot and spoiled flesh.

‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù My voice scraped out rough, too loud in the suffocating stillness. ‚ÄúMark?‚Äù

Nothing.

Just the hush of an empty house swallowing my words like fireworks that never went off.


---

I don‚Äôt know how many days have passed. Feels like days, anyway. The sky hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äîstill that starless black stretching over me like a lid. The rain hasn‚Äôt let up either, ticking against the windshield in the same slow rhythm, like time itself forgot how to move.

I‚Äôve been driving. Circling the town, the backroads, the interstate on-ramps‚Äîevery route I can think of. All of them feed me back to the same place: the tracks, the train grinding on, endless and indifferent.

Sometimes I swear I‚Äôm on roads that never had rails before‚Äîstreets I know by heart‚Äîbut there they are, steel lines cutting through the asphalt like scars.

Once, I left the car and started walking. Followed the train for what felt like hours, rain dripping down my collar, boots sucking in the mud. That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîplaces where the tracks tore straight through buildings. Houses split down the middle. Barns crumpled like cardboard. No detours, no hesitation. Just the line and the weight behind it, carving through everything like it had always been there.

Like it wasn‚Äôt following a map. Like it was making the world fit its path.

The gas gauge hasn‚Äôt budged. Not an inch. Same with the clock on the dash. Same with everything.

I‚Äôve slept a couple of times‚Äîat least, I think I did‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not the same as real sleep. My eyes close, I drift, then I‚Äôm awake again with no memory of dreams, no feeling of rest. I don‚Äôt get hungry. Don‚Äôt get thirsty. Maybe that‚Äôs a blessing.

I‚Äôve tried calling‚Äî911, friends, family. The calls go through‚Äîrings and rings‚Äîbut no one ever picks up. I even left voicemails, rambling, begging, threatening. Nothing. Not even a callback.

It‚Äôs like the world went silent and left me here to rot in the noise.


---

One night‚Äîor whatever you‚Äôd call it‚ÄîI was parked in front of those damn blinking lights again. Just sitting there, watching them pulse like they were mocking me.

I had my phone in my hand, thumb scrolling out of habit. For what had to be the thousandth time, I watched Barker in that stupid little bumblebee costume. His ears poking through the striped hood, his tail wagging like a metronome.

I almost smiled. Almost.

Then something different happened.

A break.

Just for a second, like the train had stuttered‚Äîlike its endless spine had a missing vertebra.

My heart slammed hard enough to make me dizzy.

I dropped the phone in my lap and leaned forward, squinting into the blur. Trying to track the end, to see if it was real or if my brain was just playing tricks.

I saw it. The end of this infernal machine, closely followed by its head, chasing its own tail like a dog.

After that, I couldn‚Äôt think about anything else.


---

I spent what felt like the next few days driving. Hunting. Looking for the perfect spot. A crossing with no trees creeping in from the sides, no buildings blocking the horizon. A stretch of open land where I could see the train coming from as far as possible.

Because now I knew what I had to do.

The gap was real. I saw it. I just needed to hit it at the right moment. Slide through that sliver of nothing and pray it spits me out somewhere that makes sense. Somewhere that isn‚Äôt here.

Every time I found a crossing, I parked. Watched. Counted cars until my eyes burned, memorized the rhythm like a hymn. Then moved on when the angle wasn‚Äôt right, when the sightlines weren‚Äôt long enough.

Day after day‚Äîif you can even call them that‚Äîme and those blinking red lights, trying to turn hope into math.

With each loop, I grew more familiar with my jailer. I knew its order, its colors, the texture of its passage. After the fifty-three cars of lumber came the graffiti of a devil, its horns curling across rusted steel like an omen scrawled in haste. Seventy-eight cars later, the gas tanks‚Äîwhite, bloated, and silent, carrying whatever fumes keep this world burning.

And then, after what felt like days, I saw it again‚Äîthe gap. Barely twenty feet of open track, a narrow wound in the endless steel. Through it, I caught a glimpse of the horizon, a strip of light that didn‚Äôt belong in this endless night. But as soon as it came, the engine swallowed it whole, sliding forward like it was devouring the tracks ahead of it.

I started practicing. Over and over, timing the gap like it was a doorway that only opened for a breath. Each time it came, I slammed the accelerator, tires screaming against the asphalt, the wheel shuddering under my grip. My pulse would spike as the twenty feet of open track rushed toward me‚Äîfreedom framed in steel.

And then the brake. Hard. Every muscle in my leg straining as the car shrieked and shuddered, stopping with only a few feet to spare before iron blurred past my windshield. The gap would vanish, swallowed by the engine that came sliding in like it was erasing my mistake.

I told myself I‚Äôd get it next time, but it‚Äôs hard to practice something you can only accomplish once. In the end, there‚Äôs no trick to it‚Äîjust commit, jump into the abyss, and believe you‚Äôll make it through.


---

I‚Äôm waiting for the next loop, writing this down like a memoir no one might ever read. The blinking red lights keep me company, strobing across the dashboard like a warning that never ends. The bell‚Äîits hollow chime cutting through the night, slow and steady, like a clock that only measures dread.

The white car with the skeleton graffiti.
Five hundred fifty-seven.

Sometimes I wonder‚Äîif I break the loop, could I go back? Back home, to laughter, to the sweet and savory warmth of the kitchen. Or would it still be what I saw last time‚Äîrot and mold, and a silence broken only by water dripping through the roof and the buzzing of flies?

The line of cargo draped in orange tarps.
Four hundred ninety-one.

The train roars on, endless as always. I tell myself this is the last time I‚Äôll wait. The last time I‚Äôll watch that gap open and close without me in it.

When I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôll finish this post and send it. Watch the loading icon circle endlessly. While it does, I‚Äôll wrap my phone in a sock, shove it into one of my shoes, and throw it over‚Äîacross the tracks, to the other side of the train. If there‚Äôs still something out there, maybe my bottle will find a shore and deliver its message.

The giant rolls of sheet metal.
Four hundred twenty-four.

I know now that no one can save me. Even if they tried, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm the only one who can do this‚Äîthe only one who can make that decision.

Three hundred eighty-seven.

If this goes through, I want to leave this final note to my family.

Mom, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äîfor all the restless nights, for every time you waited by the phone hoping I‚Äôd call, for every time I didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve always tried your best, more than anyone could ask for, and I didn‚Äôt. I could have been better. I could have worked on myself, but I didn‚Äôt. I let the weight of everything pull me under, and you didn‚Äôt deserve to pay the price for that. None of this was your fault. Not once. You loved me through every failure, and I wish I had loved myself enough to make that mean something.

Two hundred seventy-one.

Sarah, I‚Äôm sorry I never was the big brother you deserved‚Äîthe big brother you needed. Every time you came to me for support, or just a shoulder to cry on, I turned it around and made myself the fragile one. I should never have done that. I should have been stronger, more mature, someone you could lean on instead of the other way around. But looking back now, I see the truth‚ÄîI used you as a crutch to help me walk. And I regret it more than I can say.

Two hundred twelve.

And Dad‚Ä¶ even though you‚Äôre gone, I hope you‚Äôre still watching. You raised a fighter, and I tried to live up to that, even when it didn‚Äôt look like it. Every time life knocked me flat, I heard your voice telling me to get back up, to never stay down, and somehow I always did. Maybe I didn‚Äôt win every fight, maybe I lost more than I care to admit‚Äîbut I never quit. And I won‚Äôt now. Whatever‚Äôs on the other side of this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to face it head-on. I‚Äôll keep moving forward, keep fighting through, no matter the cost.

One hundred twenty-two.

And to you, Mark. We never really talked much, and I never got to know you the way I should have. But from what I‚Äôve seen, you‚Äôre a good man. Stay that way. Keep taking care of Sarah‚Äîshe deserves someone solid in her corner. And hey‚Ä¶ thanks for putting up with me.

Ninety-four.

If I don‚Äôt make it, I hope this train jumps the tracks when it hits me. I hope it rips itself apart and finally stops for good. Let the rails twist and shatter, let the whole damn machine collapse as it pulverizes me into paste. Because if I can‚Äôt get out, maybe at least I can stop it‚Äîso no one else ever has to ride this hell.

I gotta go now. The gap‚Äôs coming. Wish me luck.",2,1752836612.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1m2zax9,https://coff.ee/ydc_comics,YDC Call To Arms‚Ä¶üö® Mission Briefing: Agent 404 to Earth Citizens üö®,"**Hello, Earth Citizen.**

I‚Äôm Agent 404 (aka Bob), elite operative of Qwakkar ‚Äî a hyper-advanced post-bureaucratic civilization.

I was deployed to Earth to assess its bureaucratic contamination levels. Unfortunately, I was deployed too early from my hiding place in a warehouse as a plush toy ‚Äî all because a clerk added an extra digit to my barcode. I was meant to arrive in a few years. Instead, I‚Äôve awakened‚Ä¶ with no way to return to hibernation.

My human avatar ‚Äî Jelly, a comic artist and single mom in the Philippines ‚Äî has agreed to assist me in my mission. But she‚Äôs stuck in red tape just trying to launch her Etsy shop to fund our resistance.

üß± **The Red Tape Problem**

Etsy, the intergalactic commerce gateway, now demands a $20 shop setup fee for creators in many countries outside the U.S. That $20 may not sound like much‚Ä¶ but when you‚Äôre already $100 short per month, it might as well be $2,000.

This delay is keeping Jelly from launching The Red Tape Chronicles ‚Äî a satirical comic series that fights back against the bureaucracy with duck-fueled absurdity.

# üö´ Why We‚Äôre Not Using Substack for Payments

**Substack only allows one payment option for creators: Stripe.**

And Stripe is **not available in most countries**, including where Jelly lives. That means:

* No way to accept payments
* No paid subscriptions
* No monetization at all for most international creators

In short:

>

It‚Äôs an exclusionary system disguised as a publishing tool ‚Äî one that **automatically locks out talented voices from across the world.**

So while we're using Substack **for exposure and community**, we‚Äôre forced to **use alternative support channels** just to get this project off the ground.

ü¶Ü The Bigger Picture

This isn‚Äôt just about one artist.

It feels like a coordinated attack against the planet Qwakkar itself ‚Äî an effort by Earth‚Äôs bureaucratic overlords to suppress the truth, creativity, and free expression.

Jelly receives no family support (they still don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúart‚Äù is a job) and is raising a 10-month-old baby on her own. This is not an excuse ‚Äî just reality.

We‚Äôre not asking for charity or pity. We‚Äôre offering value, creativity, and a satirical resistance movement you can be part of.

# You‚Äôre Not Broke-You're Just Trading Time for Tiny Rewards

There‚Äôs a moment that hits hard at 11:42 AM on a Tuesday.

You‚Äôve finished scrolling through finance TikTok, your Slack is still pinging, and you‚Äôre looking at your bank balance thinking: *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs gotta be a smarter way to make money than sitting in endless Zooms and waiting for payday.‚Äù*

**Forex day trading**.

It‚Äôs fast, technical, and-when done right-can be a real path to consistent income. But it‚Äôs also loaded with noise, scams, and setups that‚Äôll drain your account faster than you can say ‚ÄúEUR/USD.‚Äù This guide isn‚Äôt about overnight riches. It‚Äôs about building a disciplined, skill-based approach to day trading forex in 2025-one that‚Äôs mobile, modern, and actually makes sense for your life.

# Forex Day Trading Fundamentals for 2025

**What is forex day trading and how does it work?**

Forex day trading is buying and selling currencies within the same day, with the goal of cashing in on small price swings.

Think of it like this: Instead of betting long-term on where the dollar is headed, you're riding short-term waves-maybe catching a GBP/USD move over 30 minutes, then exiting before lunch. Trades are typically open for minutes to hours, never overnight (you don‚Äôt want to get blindsided by after-hours surprises).

Here‚Äôs how it works, practically:

* You pick a currency pair (say, EUR/USD).
* You analyze where it's likely to move next-based on charts, indicators, or macro news.
* You enter a position (buy or sell), and exit with a small profit (or loss).
* You rinse and repeat-ideally with a clear system and tight risk rules.

In 2025, fast execution and real-time data are non-negotiable. If your platform lags or your setup is based on 2020 YouTube advice, you're playing with fire.

*Forex day trading is not guessing. It‚Äôs systemized short-term speculation. Discipline > prediction.*

**Key forex market hours and the best times to day trade**

The forex market never sleeps-but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should trade around the clock.

The most active and profitable windows are when major financial centers overlap:

* London‚ÄìNew York overlap (8 AM‚Äì12 PM EST): Highest volatility and volume.
* Tokyo‚ÄìLondon overlap (3 AM‚Äì4 AM EST): Lower volume but potential setups if you're early-birding.

Why does this matter? Because liquidity = faster execution and tighter spreads. And when you're scalping 10-pip moves, wide spreads can kill your edge.

If you're in Asia or Australia, the London session typically opens in your late afternoon-prime time for smart trades before dinner.

Personal note: I once tried trading during the Sydney-only session. Crickets. No volume. I literally watched a 4-pip candle form over 10 minutes and realized I was just... wasting time.

**How spreads and liquidity affect short-term trades**

Spreads-the difference between the bid and ask price-can be your hidden enemy.

In fast day trading, a 1-pip spread on a pair like EUR/USD is fine, but a 5-pip spread on a minor pair (like NZD/CAD) can instantly put you at a loss before you blink. It‚Äôs like starting a race with a 20-foot handicap.

High liquidity pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY) tend to have the tightest spreads and fastest order fills-ideal for day trading. Low liquidity pairs? More slippage, more headaches.

Always check your broker‚Äôs real-time spreads during your trading window. Some ""low spread"" brokers advertise tight numbers but widen them during news or low-volume times.

From *‚ÄúTechnical Analysis of the Financial Markets‚Äù by John J. Murphy*, Chapter 4: ‚ÄúLiquidity allows for freedom of action. In a thin market, even the most accurate chart pattern may fail because the market cannot absorb the order flow.‚Äù

**Why leverage matters more in day trading than swing trading**

Day trading is a high-frequency game. Your wins are smaller, but you take more of them-so leverage amplifies both your potential gains and risks.

In 2025, most regulated brokers offer 30:1 leverage for major pairs in Europe and Australia, and up to 50:1 in the U.S. (if you're not under prop firm rules). That means a $1,000 account can control up to $30,000 in currency-powerful, but also dangerous.

Unlike swing traders, you don't have time to ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù if the market goes against you. A 1% move against your position with 30:1 leverage? That's -30% on your capital. Gone.

Smart day traders:

* Use leverage selectively
* Keep stop losses ultra-tight
* Never risk more than 1‚Äì2% per trade

From *‚ÄúTrading in the Zone‚Äù by Mark Douglas*, Chapter 3: ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt know you exist. You can‚Äôt control it-but you can control your position size and your risk.‚Äù

# Best Forex Day Trading Strategies That Work Today

**Scalping vs. Momentum Trading: Which Suits Your Style?**

If forex day trading were a sport, scalping is speed chess, and momentum trading is blitz-fast, reactive, and based on pattern recognition.

Scalping means you‚Äôre taking 5‚Äì10 pip wins, sometimes in under two minutes. You're in and out before the market has time to change its mind. It's surgical. You're watching every tick.

Momentum trading, on the other hand, rides fast-moving trends. Think: big news drops or technical breakouts. You enter *after* confirmation and aim to hold for 20‚Äì50 pips, maybe longer if the move‚Äôs strong.

Which fits you depends on:

* Your attention span (be honest)
* Your internet speed + platform latency
* How many trades you want to take in a day (scalpers do 10+, momentum traders 2‚Äì4)

Test both in demo accounts. You‚Äôll find your rhythm quicker when you stop forcing a style that doesn‚Äôt fit your brain.

From *‚ÄúThe Disciplined Trader‚Äù by Mark Douglas*, Chapter 7: ‚ÄúSuccessful traders align their methods with their personality. Otherwise, the strategy becomes a stress test, not a system.‚Äù

**High-Probability Breakout Setups for Day Traders**

Breakouts are where most beginner traders either *print money*\-or get absolutely wrecked.

A breakout setup means you‚Äôre entering when price breaks above resistance or below support, often on high volume. But here's the kicker: false breakouts are everywhere.

To trade breakouts smartly:

* Wait for the *retest*. That means: price breaks a level ‚Üí comes back to test it ‚Üí *then* enters.
* Use volume confirmation or the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to check momentum.
* Trade high-volatility news windows (like NFP or CPI drops) when breakouts are more real.

Example: EUR/USD spikes through a 1.1000 resistance at 8:30 AM EST (news hour). You wait for it to dip back to 1.1000, it holds, and you go long. That's the structure. Not FOMO.

From *‚ÄúNaked Forex‚Äù by Alex Nekritin & Walter Peters*, Chapter 5: ‚ÄúBreakouts only work if traders *believe* in the level. Without participation, the move collapses.‚Äù

**Using Support, Resistance, and Fibonacci Intraday**

You don‚Äôt need to plaster your screen with 12 indicators.

In fact, the cleanest charts usually win. Support and resistance-horizontal zones where price has reversed before-are *still* your best friends in 2025. Add Fibonacci retracement levels (38.2%, 50%, 61.8%) to spot areas where price might pull back *and bounce hard*.

How it plays out:

* Identify support/resistance zones from higher timeframes (H1 or H4).
* Drop down to 5-minute or 15-minute charts to trade inside those zones.
* Use Fib levels to set entries, stops, or partial exits.

Bonus combo: Wait for price to bounce at both a Fib level + support zone + bullish engulfing candle? That‚Äôs your green light.

From *‚ÄúForex Price Action Scalping‚Äù by Bob Volman*, Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSupport and resistance zones must be seen as battlefields. The smart trader waits for signs of who‚Äôs winning.‚Äù

**How to Build a Repeatable Entry/Exit Ruleset**

Day trading without rules is like trying to drive a Tesla on manual steering-chaotic and dangerous.

Here‚Äôs a simple ruleset framework that 90% of profitable traders adapt in some form:

1. Trigger condition (e.g., bullish pin bar at key support)
2. Entry confirmation (e.g., RSI divergence or volume spike)
3. Stop-loss placement (e.g., just beyond recent low)
4. Take-profit logic (e.g., 1.5R or next resistance)

Once you find something that works-even in a small sample size-lock it in and journal it. Consistency turns random trades into a system.

Real talk: The more discretionary your strategy is, the more emotional it becomes. Your brain will lie to you mid-trade. Your rules won't.

From *‚ÄúHow to Day Trade for a Living‚Äù by Andrew Aziz*, Chapter 4: ‚ÄúGreat traders don‚Äôt just find good setups-they execute them the same way, every time.‚Äù

# Tools, Charts, and Platforms for Day Trading Success

**Top Forex Day Trading Platforms with Low Latency**

If your broker's platform lags during high volatility, you‚Äôre toast.

In 2025, the forex platforms most trusted by serious day traders aren‚Äôt the flashy, ad-heavy ones-they‚Äôre the ones that fill your orders fast, never freeze, and don‚Äôt play games with spreads.

Here‚Äôs what matters most:

* Low latency execution: You want trades filled within milliseconds-not ‚Äúspinning wheel‚Äù purgatory.
* Tight, real-time spreads: Especially during news. Watch for widening spreads before NFP.
* No hidden commissions: Transparent pricing wins. Every pip matters in day trading.

Top platforms in 2025 (based on execution speed, user feedback, and regulation):

* cTrader (via IC Markets or Pepperstone): Fast AF and ultra-transparent. Built for scalpers.
* MetaTrader 5 (MT5): Still king in terms of tools and broker support. Light, flexible, and global.
* TradingView (broker integration): Great for charting + execution combo, especially with OANDA or Forex.com.

Avoid offshore ‚Äúno-name‚Äù brokers offering 1000:1 leverage and zero commissions. If it sounds too good, it usually means they‚Äôre the market maker betting against you.

From *‚ÄúThe Art of Currency Trading‚Äù by Brent Donnelly*, Chapter 2: ‚ÄúExecution quality is a trader‚Äôs oxygen. If you can‚Äôt breathe in and out of trades quickly, you‚Äôll suffocate during volatility.‚Äù

**Must-Have Charting Tools and Indicators for Intraday Moves**

The right charting setup isn‚Äôt about loading 19 indicators. It‚Äôs about clarity. You should be able to glance and *know what‚Äôs happening*.

Here‚Äôs a clean 2025-ready stack most day traders swear by:

* Volume-weighted average price (VWAP): Tracks the true average price of the day. Crucial for spotting where smart money trades.
* 20 and 50 EMA (exponential moving averages): Quick visual of short-term momentum and crossover entries.
* Relative Strength Index (RSI): Classic, but gold. Look for divergence setups on the 5-minute chart.
* ADR (Average Daily Range): Tells you if a move is stretched or has room left. No more chasing already-run candles.

And yes, price action still matters more than indicators. Tools are supported, not a crutch.

My chart setup: Dark background, no gridlines, VWAP + EMAs, RSI tucked below. Clean, mobile-friendly, and fast on the eyes during long sessions.

From *‚ÄúTechnical Analysis Explained‚Äù by Martin Pring*, Chapter 6: ‚ÄúIndicators should confirm what price is telling you-not the other way around. Too much clutter blinds the trader.‚Äù

**Pros and Cons of Automated Forex Trading Bots**

Automation sounds sexy-‚ÄúLet the bot trade while you sleep!‚Äù-but the reality? Most retail bots lose money, especially in fast, choppy markets.

**Pros:**

* Bots don‚Äôt feel fear or greed.
* Great for backtesting and rule-based systems.
* Work 24/5, ideal if you can‚Äôt stare at charts all day.

**Cons:**

* Market conditions shift. Bots don‚Äôt adapt unless coded to.
* Many EAs (expert advisors) are built on outdated logic.
* Zero emotional control = blowing up accounts if risk isn‚Äôt capped.

If you go the bot route:

* Use regulated brokers that allow EAs
* Backtest on multiple years of data
* Start on demo, then micro-lot live

And know this: No bot replaces human judgment. The best bots are co-pilots, not autopilots.

From *‚ÄúFlash Boys‚Äù by Michael Lewis*, Chapter 9: ‚ÄúSpeed is power-but in trading, speed without context is chaos.‚Äù

**Mobile Trading Apps for Fast Execution on the Go**

Let‚Äôs be real-you‚Äôre not always at your desk. Maybe you‚Äôre commuting, mid-coffee run, or just vibing at a friend‚Äôs house when the perfect setup hits. Mobile trading in 2025 is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.

Top-rated forex mobile apps that don‚Äôt suck:

* cTrader Mobile: Surprisingly smooth, with almost desktop-level functionality.
* MetaTrader 5 (MT5) app: Lightweight, widely used, tons of indicators.
* TradingView Mobile: A+ for charting, but needs a broker link to execute.
* FOREX.com: Great for U.S. traders, tight spreads + good UX.

Tips for mobile day trading:

* Use limit orders or preset stop-loss/take-profit-don‚Äôt market order on a shaky signal.
* Only trade familiar pairs and setups you‚Äôve tested. Mobile is not for experimenting.

Set push alerts for price zones you care about. You get notified when your setup triggers, not distracted every time EUR/USD wiggles 3 pips.

From *‚ÄúReminiscences of a Stock Operator‚Äù by Edwin Lef√®vre*, Chapter 8: ‚ÄúThe market does not beat them. They beat themselves, because though they have brains they cannot sit tight.‚Äù

# Real Risk Management for Forex Day Traders

**How much capital should you risk per trade?**

Here‚Äôs the fastest way to stay in the game: risk 1% or less of your account per trade. Full stop.

If you‚Äôre trading with $5,000, that means your maximum loss on any single trade should be $50. Not $150. Not $500. Just $50.

Why? Because string together a few losers (which *will* happen), and you‚Äôre still alive to fight another day. Most new traders lose because they don‚Äôt size down-they size up, chasing wins.

Here‚Äôs a formula that works:

nginx

CopyEdit

Risk per trade = (Account balance) x (Risk %)¬†¬†

Example: $5,000 x 0.01 = $50 max loss

Hot tip: Focus more on position size than ‚Äúhow many pips you want.‚Äù A 20-pip stop can still be safe if you size your lot correctly.

From *‚ÄúRisk Management and Financial Institutions‚Äù by John C. Hull*, Chapter 10: ‚ÄúEven the best strategies fail without capital discipline. It‚Äôs not about being right-it‚Äôs about staying solvent.‚Äù

**Setting stop-loss and take-profit ratios that preserve capital**

Want to feel like a professional trader instead of a gambler? Lock in this mindset:

* Every trade must have a defined stop-loss
* Every trade must have a logical take-profit

This is your risk/reward ratio in action. The gold standard? At least 1:1.5 or 1:2. That means for every $1 you risk, you aim to make $1.50 or $2.

Why it works:

* Even with a 50% win rate, you‚Äôre still profitable.
* You‚Äôre no longer chasing. You‚Äôre executing a math-backed edge.

Example:

* You risk 20 pips to make 40.
* Hit 5 wins and 5 losses? You‚Äôre still up.

Without this structure, one trade can wipe out five good ones. That‚Äôs how accounts bleed slowly, unnoticed.

From *‚ÄúThe New Trading for a Living‚Äù by Dr. Alexander Elder*, Chapter 6: ‚ÄúThe goal is not to avoid losses. It‚Äôs to ensure no single loss takes you out of the game.‚Äù

**The danger of overleveraging in day trading**

Here‚Äôs the raw truth: leverage looks like freedom, but acts like a loaded weapon.

Most brokers in 2025 offer 30:1 or 50:1 leverage. That means your $1,000 can control $30,000 to $50,000 in currency. It sounds powerful, but if the market moves against you by just 0.5%, you're staring at a 15%‚Äì25% drawdown.

Day traders fall into this trap *all the time*:

* They hit a hot streak
* They double down with bigger trades
* One bad move hits, and boom-30% of the account gone

Here‚Äôs how to stay safe:

* Use leverage as a tool, not a lifeline
* Calculate your lot size based on your stop-loss, not on your dreams
* Walk away if you‚Äôre tempted to ‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù

From *‚ÄúAgainst the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk‚Äù by Peter L. Bernstein*, Chapter 14: ‚ÄúRisk is not inherently bad. What‚Äôs dangerous is misunderstanding it.‚Äù

**What to do after a losing streak: Resetting without revenge trading**

This might be the most important lesson in this entire guide.

Losing streaks happen to everyone-yes, even traders with 6-figure months and solid systems. What separates pros from spiraling newbies is how they respond.

Here‚Äôs a 3-step reset plan when you‚Äôre in a drawdown:

1. Step back for 24 hours. Don‚Äôt even open charts. Emotion = noise.
2. Journal the last 5 trades. Were they by the rules? Or were you guessing?
3. Switch to demo or micro-lots for 3‚Äì5 trades. Rebuild confidence with precision, not size.

This *resets your nervous system* and reminds you that your job isn‚Äôt to make money every day-it‚Äôs to follow your edge consistently.

Personal note: After a three-day spiral in 2023, I made a rule: No live trades until I string together 3 clean, rule-following demo entries. It changed everything.

From *‚ÄúThe Psychology of Money‚Äù by Morgan Housel*, Chapter 11: ‚ÄúControlling your behavior is more powerful than being smart.‚Äù

# Trader Psychology and Performance Under Pressure

**How to avoid FOMO and overtrading in volatile markets**

FOMO is the silent killer of forex accounts.

It shows up like this:

* You miss a clean EUR/USD move.
* Now you're itching to ‚Äúmake it back‚Äù or ‚Äúcatch the next one.‚Äù
* So you enter late. Or worse-randomly.
* One loss leads to another. Then you‚Äôre rage-clicking.

Here‚Äôs the antidote: accept that the market will move without you-and that‚Äôs okay.

¬†Tactical ways to kill FOMO:

* Use alerts at key levels instead of staring at charts all day.
* Pre-define your setups. If it doesn‚Äôt meet your rules, it‚Äôs not your trade.
* Have a daily trade limit (e.g., 3 setups max). Once you hit it, you're done.

Mantra: *Missing a trade is better than forcing one. There will always be another setup. Always.*

From *‚ÄúThe Daily Trading Coach‚Äù by Brett Steenbarger*, Chapter 1: ‚ÄúEmotional reactivity is the single biggest drain on a trader‚Äôs edge. Consistency begins with self-awareness.‚Äù

**Creating a daily trading routine for mental clarity**

Day trading is like being an athlete. You don‚Äôt just show up and sprint. You warm up, prep, and focus.

Here‚Äôs a routine that works-even if you‚Äôve got a 9‚Äì5 or other responsibilities:

1. Pre-market scan (20 mins): Mark major support/resistance, news events, and pairs to watch.
2. Trading window (1‚Äì2 hours max): Trade during your peak mental energy. No ‚Äújust in case‚Äù setups.
3. Post-trade review (15 mins): Journal every entry, exit, emotion. What felt off? What worked?

It‚Äôs not about being robotic. It‚Äôs about protecting your brain from burnout and overthinking.

Real talk: Trading all day doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre grinding. It usually means you‚Äôre guessing.

From *‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù by James Clear*, Chapter 5: ‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù

**The role of journaling in day trading improvement**

You won‚Äôt remember why you took that trade in three days. But your journal will.

Every elite trader keeps some kind of journal or log. Not just for numbers, but for *patterns*. Emotional, technical, and time-based.

What to track:

* Date/time, pair, strategy used
* Entry + exit price, stop-loss, take-profit
* Screenshot of chart + written reason for trade
* How you felt before, during, after

Within a month, you‚Äôll start seeing repeat mistakes or hidden strengths.

Example: You notice your London session trades are 70% accurate, but the New York session is chaotic. That's the edge. That‚Äôs real.

And no-this doesn‚Äôt need to be a giant spreadsheet. Even a Google Doc or Notion template works. The goal is clarity, not perfection.

From *‚ÄúOne Good Trade‚Äù by Mike Bellafiore*, Chapter 9: ‚ÄúYour journal is your mirror. It shows you what you refuse to see in real time.‚Äù

# Taxation and Compliance for Active Forex Traders

**How forex day trading profits are taxed in major countries**

This part can get murky fast, so let‚Äôs break it down.

Your trading profits are income. Governments want their slice. But *how* they tax you depends on where you live and how your trades are classified.

**United States:**

* Forex falls under IRC Section 988 (default) = taxed as ordinary income.
* Max tax rate? Whatever your income bracket is (up to \~37%).
* But-you can elect Section 1256 treatment (for certain contracts), which gives a blended 60/40 tax rate:
   * 60% long-term capital gains
   * 40% short-term

**United Kingdom:**

* Spread betting = tax-free (if you‚Äôre not doing it professionally).
* But if you‚Äôre day trading via CFDs or forex accounts? Profits fall under capital gains tax (currently 10‚Äì20%).

**Australia:**

* Forex gains are considered income and taxed at marginal rates.
* No capital gains discounts unless holding for 12+ months (which day traders don‚Äôt).

Canada, Germany, India? It gets trickier-most treat it as business income if you‚Äôre trading actively. You may need to register as self-employed or declare it as speculative profit.

Talk to a tax pro in your country. Don‚Äôt wing it. Don‚Äôt wait until April.

From *‚ÄúTax Guide for Traders‚Äù by Robert Green, CPA*, Chapter 3: ‚ÄúTraders often pay more in taxes than they realize-not because of the rates, but because of misclassification.‚Äù

**What records to keep for tax reporting as a day trader**

If you‚Äôve ever stared at your trade history from a broker and felt your soul leave your body... you‚Äôre not alone.

But here‚Äôs what you *actually* need to stay on top of taxes:

* Monthly P&L statements (most brokers export this)
* Trade log with dates, instrument, entry/exit, profit/loss
* Screenshots or notes for unusual trades (e.g., news spikes or platform outages)
* Brokerage fee records (commissions, spreads, rollover fees)

Bonus tip: Use tools like TraderVue, Edgewonk, or a custom Excel template to organize this. And back it up. Tax audits don‚Äôt care if your hard drive crashed.

You don‚Äôt need perfect records-you need *consistent ones*.

From *‚ÄúProfit First‚Äù by Mike Michalowicz*, Chapter 6: ‚ÄúMoney loves clarity. When your finances are murky, so is your decision-making.‚Äù

**Legal leverage limits and compliance per region (2025 update)**

Gone are the Wild West days of 500:1 leverage with shady brokers. Regulators across the globe have cracked down-for good reason.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs legal and current (2025 edition):

* **U.S. (NFA/CFTC regulated):**
   * 50:1 max on major pairs
   * 20:1 on minors
   * No hedging allowed on same account
* **UK and EU (FCA, ESMA rules)**:
   * 30:1 on majors
   * 20:1 on minors
   * Negative balance protection required
* **Australia (ASIC rules)**:
   * Same as EU: 30:1 max
   * Higher leverage only through whitelisted pro trader status
* **Offshore brokers** (like in Seychelles, Bahamas, etc.):
   * Offer up to 500:1 or more
   * BUT: Often unregulated or lightly regulated
   * No legal recourse if they ghost you

Bottom line: Leverage is like caffeine. A little boosts performance. Too much gives you heart palpitations and poor decisions.

From *‚ÄúUnshakeable‚Äù by Tony Robbins*, Chapter 4: ‚ÄúThe biggest risk isn‚Äôt volatility. It‚Äôs betting big without knowing the rules.‚Äù

# FAQ

# What‚Äôs the minimum capital to start forex day trading effectively?

Technically, some brokers let you start with $100. Realistically? You need at least $500‚Äì$1,000 to make it meaningful and manageable.

Why? Because with 1% risk per trade, a $100 account means risking $1 per trade. That‚Äôs... not much breathing room. Every tiny move feels like a crisis.

But with $1,000:

* You can risk $10 per trade
* You get to practice risk management *properly*
* You‚Äôre less likely to ‚ÄúYOLO‚Äù trades out of boredom

Small accounts are fine to learn-but if you want to build consistency and feel like a real trader, you need enough capital to follow your rules without panic.

From *‚ÄúMoney: Master the Game‚Äù by Tony Robbins*, Chapter 7: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt build wealth with nickels and fear. You need a system-and room to let it work.‚Äù

# Can beginners be successful in forex day trading?

Yes-but not without patience, practice, and structure. This is *not* the game for fast money seekers or crypto bros chasing dopamine spikes.

Most beginners lose because:

* They trade live too soon
* They skip journaling
* They chase trades with no system

But if you:

* Use a demo account for 1‚Äì3 months
* Learn one or two simple setups
* Focus more on risk than profit‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶you can absolutely build skill. There‚Äôs no gatekeeping here. Just a brutal learning curve that rewards the obsessed.

Real advice: Don‚Äôt treat forex like a lottery. Treat it like a sport. Show up every day to train, not win.

From *‚ÄúThe Little Book of Trading‚Äù by Michael Covel*, Chapter 1: ‚ÄúThe barrier to success isn‚Äôt knowledge-it‚Äôs emotional control and relentless repetition.‚Äù

# Which time frame is best for fast-paced trading?

For day traders, the sweet spot is usually the 5-minute or 15-minute chart. Here‚Äôs why:

* 5-minute: Great for scalping or catching early momentum
* 15-minute: Better for structure, cleaner breakouts
* 1-minute: Way too noisy unless you‚Äôre a hyper-fast scalper (read: not ideal for beginners)

That said, always mark key levels from the 1-hour or 4-hour chart first. Higher time frames give context. Lower time frames give entries.

Think of it like Google Maps: You zoom out to plan the route, then zoom in to make turns.

From *‚ÄúTechnical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes‚Äù by Brian Shannon*, Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTimeframe alignment is the difference between a sniper shot and a wild swing.‚Äù

# Are demo accounts useful for testing day trading strategies?

100% yes-but only if you treat them like real money.

**Demo accounts:**

* Let you test strategies without risking cash
* Help you get comfortable with your platform
* Show whether your rules actually work *before* you go live

But here‚Äôs the trap: Most people use demos with no emotional discipline. They overtrade, risk 20% per trade, and then wonder why they bomb when they switch to real money.

**To get real value from a demo:**

* Trade with the same size you‚Äôll use live
* Use real stop-loss and take-profit levels
* Stick to a daily trade limit

If you can follow your system in demo mode for 30+ trades without breaking your rules? You‚Äôre probably ready to go small live.

As someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen, both for meal prep and reheating leftovers, I found its stainless steel and brushed chrome finish incredibly appealing. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit on a countertop without dominating the space, yet spacious inside with 1 cubic foot of cooking area. At first glance, it seemed like the perfect combination of style and practicality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This microwave feels solid the moment you unbox it. The stainless steel interior is a standout feature‚Äîit resists absorbing food odors and is incredibly easy to clean. Having a toddler in the house means constant spills, and the wipe-clean interior has been a game-changer for me. Plus, the chrome accents on the door handle and control panel give it a premium appearance. The dimensions, roughly 20.5 inches wide and 12.8 inches high, allow it to fit comfortably on most countertops without feeling bulky. While it looks sophisticated, it‚Äôs not so futuristic that you‚Äôre unsure how to use it.

**Functionality and Performance**  
Testing the microwave revealed just how versatile it is. With 25 preprogrammed settings, I found myself exploring one-touch options like reheating coffee, defrosting steaks, and even cooking frozen vegetables. The 1000-watt power ensures food heats uniformly, a problem I‚Äôve run into with less powerful models. The 10 power levels let you customize the intensity, making it ideal for various types of meals. I tried everything from warming butter to cooking a baked potato, and each task was executed flawlessly. Additionally, the rotating 12-inch glass turntable ensures even heating, which was evident when reheating Friday night pizza.

[Check Cuisinart CMW-100 price on Amazon.](https://kitchenchampions.com/p/b000iw9j20/)

**Two-Stage Cooking and Defrost Functions**  
One feature I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until now is the two-stage cooking option. It efficiently switches between defrosting and cooking without requiring you to reset the settings. For example, I defrosted some chicken breasts by weight and then had the microwave transition seamlessly into cooking them‚Äîit‚Äôs incredibly useful for meal prepping on hectic weekdays. The time-defrost function is also surprisingly precise, avoiding the issue of overcooked edges that happens with poorly designed microwaves.

**User Experience and Controls**  
Interacting with this microwave is simple, thanks to the touchpad controls and LCD screen. The interface is intuitive, even for someone less tech-savvy like my dad, who used it over the holidays without needing a tutorial. The presets are labeled with clear icons, and the response speed of the touchpad is quick. However, the screen isn't backlit, making it slightly hard to read under dim lighting.

**Pluses**  
- Stainless steel interior resists odors and cleans easily.  
- Compact size with generous internal capacity.  
- Two-stage cooking simplifies complex meals.  

**Critiques**  
- The LCD screen could have been backlit for better visibility.  
- It‚Äôs a bit pricier than basic models without offering Bluetooth connectivity or app-controlled features, which some might expect at this price range.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to competitors like Panasonic and Toshiba, the Cuisinart CMW-100 holds up well. For instance, the stainless steel interior is a hygienic upgrade over the standard ceramic-coated options offered by many brands. That said, Panasonic models often come with Smart Inverter technology, which provides more precise cooking control but also increases the cost. Toshiba has options equipped with better presets for grilling or air frying, though those are bulkier and not as visually striking. I‚Äôd say the Cuisinart excels in style and ease of cleaning but slightly lags behind in offering cutting-edge features.

**Cost Efficiency**  
While this microwave is not the cheapest option out there, its premium-look finish and functionality justify the investment for someone like me who uses it every day. I think it offers reliable cost-efficiency because the durability of the stainless steel interior means it‚Äôs built to last. It‚Äôs an excellent value proposition if you‚Äôre tired of microwaves that seem to fall apart after a couple of years.

[A sample of antimony is displayed at the Natural History Museum in London, Britain, June 6, 2025. REUTERS\/Isabel Infantes\/File Photo](https://preview.redd.it/zxlhlaodwldf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef1c863141f64ee93cb04c83dc7173cc77899dbb)

BEIJING, July 18 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of State Security on Friday said foreign spy agencies had tried to ""steal"" rare earths and pledged to crack down on infiltration and espionage targeted at its critical mineral sector. Foreign intelligence agencies and their agents had colluded with ""domestic lawbreakers"" to steal rare earth-related items from China, posing a serious threat to China's national security, the spy agency said in a statement on its WeChat account without naming any specific country.

The ministry said it had detected attempts by an unnamed country to bypass export restrictions by forging labels, falsifying cargo manifests and transshipping cargoes, where products are routed through third countries before going to their final destination. Reuters reported exclusively this month that unusually large quantities of antimony - a metal used in batteries, chips and flame retardants - appeared to have been¬†[transshipped into the United States](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-us-buyers-critical-minerals-bypass-chinas-export-ban-2025-07-09/)¬†via Thailand and Mexico after China banned U.S. exports.

Mineral processing optimisation underway to unlock rare earth potential; long-lead equipment ordered for demonstration plant.

American Rare Earths (ASX: ARR) **is progressing its Halleck Creek Rare Earths Project in Wyoming, USA, with mineral processing optimisation and preparations for a demonstration plant.** American Rare Earths is a critical minerals company focused on reshaping the U.S. rare earths industry. Through its subsidiary Wyoming Rare (USA) Inc., the company is advancing the Halleck Creek Project in Wyoming‚Äîa world-class rare earth deposit with the potential to secure America‚Äôs critical mineral independence for generations.

The company has commenced mineral processing optimisation tests at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek project, with the goal of increasing magnet rare earth recoveries. These tests will run parallel to existing mineral processing tests, exploring various milling methods and optimising mineral separation and concentration. Test mining is set to begin immediately at the Cowboy State Mine to provide bulk samples for the optimisation work and feedstock for the demonstration plant.

To further advance the project, American Rare Earths has ordered long-lead time equipment for the demonstration plant, including conventional magnetic separation equipment. The demonstration plant will showcase and fine-tune the rare earth production process at a larger scale. The company intends to use the mineral processing flow-sheet developed from the optimisation work as a blueprint for the plant, as well as future technical studies.

# JULY 17th, 2025~Legislators Embrace Technology Recycling to Compete With China

The digital detritus of discarded laptops, phones and other electronics contain much-sought-after resources hidden in plain sight.

Lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday pushed for improved recycling infrastructure to secure critical minerals, such as lithium, that power electric vehicles and smartphones. The¬†[race is on to secure¬†](https://www.wsj.com/business/us-rare-earth-producer-texas-58796240?mod=article_inline)critical minerals in the U.S., in part to offset China‚Äôs dominance in the ownership and processing of these materials. The U.S. is also lagging behind China on renewable energy¬†[and electric vehicles](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trumps-megabill-gives-chinese-ev-makers-a-leg-up-says-head-of-auto-group-8d12948d?mod=article_inline), driven in part by critical minerals.

‚ÄúE-waste is a commodity that can be repurposed in our fight to not only be energy independent, but energy dominant,‚Äù said Gary Palmer (R., Ala), who led the hearing as chair of the house committee on energy and commerce, advocating for the U.S. to ‚Äúuse recycling as a tool to compete with China and to protect our communities.‚Äù

Brett Guthrie¬†(R., Ky) echoed his assertion, advocating for the recovery of ‚Äúvaluable materials such as critical minerals from items that are discarded everyday.‚Äù

[Electronics recycling](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/your-junk-is-needed-for-the-new-electric-era-504a7e8f?mod=article_inline)¬†is complicated, especially with the medley of metals, glass and plastic that make up the devices. And electronic waste will expand courtesy of the data center boom fueling artificial intelligence, which uses graphic processing units and servers that only last for a few years.

Raul Ruiz (D., Calif), who represents the resource-rich Imperial Valley region known as ‚ÄúLithium Valley‚Äù near the Mexican border, focused on the importance of a critical-minerals strategy. He pushed for ‚Äúcritical mineral recovery and recycling to build a sustainable supply chain,‚Äù citing energy dependence and national security. Lithium is used for electric vehicles and battery storage.

At the hearing, legislators questioned Matt Bedingfield, executive vice president of commercial strategy and growth at Mint Innovation, a company which recovers metals such as gold, copper and silver from old laptops, phones and other electronics. Mint has a plant in Sydney, Australia, but is poised to expand to Texas.

‚ÄúWe can only import these metals once by recycling them and then using them in our industry here too,‚Äù he said.¬†¬†

Some 62 million metric tons of electronic waste was collected in 2022, according to a report from the United Nations.

There are environmental considerations also.¬†Mariannette Miller-Meeks¬†(R., Iowa) highlighted that minerals from electronic waste can leach into the ground when piling up in landfills. In March, she reintroduced the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act, which would task the Environmental Protection Agency with setting up a program to boost recycling in communities that have at most one recovery facility within a 75-mile radius.

Miller-Meeks also pointed to competition with China. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing China purchase our aluminum scrap above market prices, process it, and sell it back to us at a premium,‚Äù she said.

The hearing also focused on plastics recycling, with the United Nations set to meet in August in Geneva, Switzerland, to continue negotiating a plastics treaty.¬†

Since the 1950s, some 9.2 billion tons of plastic has been made, more than three quarters of which has ended up in¬†[landfills, dumps](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beverage-and-snack-giants-defend-sustainable-packaging-plans-amid-investor-pressure-cc3a87df?mod=article_inline)¬†and the ocean, according to the U.N. environment program‚Äôs website. Between 19 million and 23 million tons of plastic waste ends up in lakes, rivers and seas every year, it said.

tates from California to Minnesota recently enacted laws that require companies to contribute to recycling-infrastructure funding, a requirement known as extended producer responsibility, that puts the onus of where a product ends up on businesses. And¬†[some shoppers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/shoppers-are-slowly-turning-away-from-plastic-packaging-f106a737?mod=article_inline)¬†are turning away from plastic packaging over sustainability concerns.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre committed to ending plastic waste and advancing a circular economy for plastics, because frankly, we need plastics; modern life does rely on them,‚Äù said Ross Eisenberg, president of America‚Äôs Plastic Makers at the American Chemistry Council, speaking at the hearing. He referenced packaging that extends the shelf life of food as well as medical equipment such as syringes, gloves and masks.

‚ÄúPlastic is just not recycled enough, to fix that we have to modernize the way that we collect, reuse and recycle materials,‚Äù Eisenberg said.

‚ÄúWe have to upgrade a recycling system that was set up in the 1970s for bottles, cans and paper.‚Äù

There is a lot of work to be done, said Paul Tonko (D., NY), adding that better recycling labeling, accessibility and education is also essential to keep excess waste from clogging landfills.

‚ÄúI understand the desire to promote innovation to overcome these challenges,‚Äù Tonko said. ‚ÄúBut in reality, our recycling system needs some very basic foundational improvements before we can even begin to suggest that new technologies will save us.‚Äù

# JULY 17th, 2025~How China created a chokehold on the rare earths industry

[How China created a chokehold on the rare earths industry | Georgia Public Broadcasting](https://www.gpb.org/news/2025/07/17/how-china-created-chokehold-on-the-rare-earths-industry)

https://reddit.com/link/1m2z9i3/video/sfjx4bxsxldf1/player

Deep in an underground, World War Two-era vault, investment manager Louis O'Connor guards his firm's most valuable assets.

The treasure inside? Rare earth elements.

""Make no mistake about it, there's three and a half meter walls and doors and armed security,"" says O'Connor, the CEO of Strategic Metals Invest, a firm that lets individual investors buy into stockpiles of rare earths.

Many so-called rare earth elements are actually quite common, and they are mined globally, but China has a near-monopoly on¬†[refining them](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf)¬†for use in everyday electronics, like speakers, as well as for crucial defense systems, like fighter jets.

When China decided to substantially cut off exports of seven types of rare earths this spring, O'Connor says he felt the pinch immediately. One investor touring the company's vault at the time offered on the spot to buy O'Connor's entire inventory of terbium¬†and dysprosium, two valuable ""heavy"" rare earth elements, he says.

The episode illustrated the power of China's dominance over the industry.

""They're installing what you might call a tap system, where they can turn that tap on and off,"" says O'Connor.

That supply chain chokehold has given China a powerful tool it has wielded in a trade war with the U.S. Within weeks of China requiring foreign companies to apply for a license to buy rare earths, several¬†[American](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-ceo-china-rare-earth-shortage-car-production/)¬†and¬†[European](http://autonews.com/europe/ane-china-exports-tariffs-rare-earths-evs-0604/)¬†companies said they were forced to shut down production lines.¬†[Regaining access](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429236/why-rare-earth-elements-are-central-to-u-s-china-trade-talks)¬†to Chinese rare earths was a central point of contention in US-China trade¬†[negotiations](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/g-s1-71676/us-china-trade-talks-london)¬†this spring.

But China did not always enjoy such dominance. Developing an export control regime they could minutely control took decades of sometimes painful trial and error.

# Spotting strategic value

During most of the 20th century, the U.S. was top dog in the rare earths industry, which was then-concentrated around¬†[the Mountain Pass mine](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/23/949590270/the-strategic-value-of-rare-earths)¬†in California.

China also recognized the strategic value of rare earths, and starting in the 1960s, Chinese executives came to visit Mountain Pass several times, says Mark Smith, a former CEO at Molycorp, a major rare earths processing company at the Mountain Pass mine.

""We toured them. We explained what we do, allowed them to take pictures and everything else. They took it back to China,"" says Smith.

Chinese refineries then improved on technology, and taking advantage of cheap electricity in China, hundreds of lucrative mining and processing firms in the country popped up to service mostly domestic demand for rare earths.

But the industry was highly unregulated and chaotic, as hundreds of small-scale, private mines and refineries competed against one another, undercutting each other's profits.

""They drive down the price against themselves,"" says Chris Ruffle, an investor who has worked in China for decades, including in the metals industry. ""They kill themselves.""

""China's rare earths aren't being sold at a 'rare' price but at an 'earth' price,""¬†[complained](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235016.shtml)¬†Xiao Yaqing, a minister of industry and information technology.

# A dirty business

As Chinese producers sought an upper hand in rare earths, they also unleashed unrestrained mining that came at great cost to the country's natural resources.

In the early 2000s, Ruffles visited a private rare earths refinery in Jiangsu, a province in southern China. ""The thick smoke slightly gave it away,"" says Ruffles of the facilities. He described huge piles of tailings ‚Äî toxic, metallic by-products from other industrial processes, sitting on the bare ground.

Destructive, small-scale mining was especially prevalent in southern China, where the most valuable, natural deposits of ""heavy"" rare earth elements are.

""They would mine the side of the hill with their acts and picks and shovels, and then they would dig a hole in the ground, no liners or anything like that at all. Then they poured five gallon buckets of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid‚Ä¶.let that certain stew for a while,"" remember Smith, who frequently visited China during this period. ""When the storms come in, all that acid just washes out.""

The mining left China's terrain scarred with lasting groundwater and soil pollution. Local residents staged period protests against rare earth mining, but rare earth mining provided local governments with[¬†abundant revenue,](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-10-21/133523341196.shtml?from=wap)¬†and they repeatedly ignored central government orders to close down dirty mines.

""The rare earth industry has the profits of \[selling\] heroin but without the risks‚Ä¶ Rare earth is more addictive than drugs,""¬†[wrote](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20120418/116762.shtml)¬†two Chinese state media reporters in a 2012 investigation into rare earths mining.

""There are generally two types of people who can deal with rare earths: the first is someone who has just been released from prison, and the other is someone who can get someone out of prison. Those who are not afraid of death and leading cadres are all involved,"" in the journalists wrote.

# Consolidation or bust

By the late 1990s, Beijing had had enough of the domestic price wars and local pollution. It started imposing production and export quotas to incentivize upstream processing of rare earths, cut down on pollution, and protect the industry from foreign intervention.

The quotas created two sets of prices, ""in effect, two tier pricing, when exports were limited to the rest of the world that resulted in lower rare earth prices for domestic Chinese consumers,"" says Rod Eggert, a professor of mineral economics at the Colorado School of Mines.

There was also a second, unintended consequence to the quotas: they creating a thriving smuggling industry. Up to a third of the country's rare earth products in the mid-2000s was illegal, smuggled out of China despite state controls, analysts estimate, because of demand from Japan and the U.S.

Then, American and European companies cried foul over the export quotas, and in 2014, the World Trade Organization¬†[ruled](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-wins-victory-in-rare-earths-dispute-with-China)¬†China could not use them.

But China was unfazed. It was already shifting tactics. It would seek global dominance in rare earths not through controlling the volume of outputs, but instead, by controlling which firms could operate.

# A ""secret war"" to consolidate

Authorities dubbed the campaign ""one plus five:"" an ambitious, and often ruthless, effort to winnow down the entire rare earth industry to just six consolidated companies. Authorities¬†[called](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20120418/116762.shtml)¬†the consolidation their ""secret war"" against illegal production.

Starting in 2011, provincial authorities¬†[were instructed](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20110726/105784.shtml)¬†to mount¬†[unannounced audits](http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0806/c1001-22465601.html)¬†of mines,¬†[to seize](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-08/08/c_129214123.htm)¬†contraband ore and byproducts, and when needed,¬†[dynamiting](https://gdee.gd.gov.cn/shbtwj/content/post_2304355.html)¬†and¬†[smashing](https://www.chinanews.com/gn/news/2008/04-22/1227749.shtml)¬†to pieces illegal mining operations.

""I saw firsthand how the private sector got squeezed out,"" says¬†Ruffle, the investor.

Within four years, China declared victory. It announced the closure of dozens of smaller mining and refining companies and guided the mergers of surviving companies into six supersized, mostly- state-owned firms, nicknamed the Big Six in China.

Through the Big Six, China could now largely control both supply and price.

""Whereas before you had a lot more competition from different producers, now you get very homogeneous pricing,"" says Jan Giese, a Frankfurt-based rare earth trader. ""It's difficult to have competitive bids.""

# American upstarts

Unlike metal commodities like nickel or gold, there is no independent exchange for buying and selling rare earth elements.

Because Chinese companies can cause huge price fluctuations depending on how much they decide to produce or export, investors have been wary of pouring money into new ventures in the U.S..

That has made raising capital to build refining plants a big challenge for American companies trying to break back into the industry.

***""They're putting their money into things like Alphabet and, you know, Amazon and, you know, all the high-flying type of investments and just very, very little, if any, is coming into the mining industry,"" says Smith, the former CEO of Molycorp.***

***Some are still trying. Smith's new venture, NioCorp, is opening new mines and refining capacity for rare earths in***¬†[***Nebraska***](https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-rare-earths-mine-drilling/64626271)***.***

Phoenix Tailings, in Massachusetts, is also among a handful of American companies prepared to refine rare earths, by refining the tailings, or leftover waste, from mining companies.

[""We have to be full speed on the gas to make sure we're successful here](https://www.gpb.org/target%3D_blank),"" says Nicholas Myers, one of the co-founders and CEO.

The company already makes rare earth magnets for automotive and defense companies, and they are currently building a second plant in New Hampshire which the company says can meet about half of the U.S.' defense needs for rare earth products.

For years, Myers said his company struggled to attract investment at the magnitude needed to compete with Chinese firms in scale.

This year, things changed, after China implemented a licensing system for foreign companies which caused rare earth exports to plummet.

""Definite tone shift,"" says Myers, ""I think what happened is the end customers, the folks at the big automotive companies or defense primes, realized that they had told their bosses that China would never shut off the supply for them.""

But this spring, China did shut off that supply.

The cut off galvanized American investor interest in rare earths, says Myers. Phoenix Tailings¬†[garnered](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250430735778/en/Rare-Earth-Metals-Refining-Company-Phoenix-Tailings-Closes-on-Additional-%2433M-in-Funding-From-Strategic-Investors-Bringing-the-Round-up-to-%2476M-to-Support-Rare-Earth-Metal-Independence)¬†a major round of investment in May, and now, for the first time in decades, the U.S. may make rare earth minerals again.

# JULY 15th, 2025~Washington‚Äôs 30‚ÄëDay Sprint to Rewire the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chains

[A Month of Mineral Realpolitik: Washington‚Äôs 30‚ÄëDay Sprint to Rewire the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chains - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/market-opinion/a-month-of-mineral-realpolitik-washingtons-30%E2%80%91day-sprint-to-rewire-the-u-s-critical-minerals-supply-chains/)

*Washington has seldom moved this fast on any industrial question, yet in the last month, Congress, the White House, and the Supreme‚ÄØCourt orchestrated a blitz of statutes, budget riders, executive memoranda, and precedent‚Äëshifting rulings that together reset the rules of engagement for the critical minerals industry. What follows is a concise tour of the month‚Äôs pivotal moves‚Äîan accelerated summer sprint reshaping America‚Äôs critical minerals playbook.*

# Congress: From Tax Credits to Direct Appropriations

Seabed mining enters the legislative mainstream.¬†On‚ÄØ18‚ÄØJune, Representatives Mike‚ÄØEzell (R‚ÄëMS) and Mariannette‚ÄØMiller‚ÄëMeeks (R‚ÄëIA)¬†[filed](https://ezell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1835)¬†H.R.‚ÄØ4018, the¬†Unleash America‚Äôs Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources Act, embedding President‚ÄØTrump‚Äôs Executive Order‚ÄØ14285 in statute and instructing the Interior Department to license U.S. seabed mining in the exclusive economic zone‚ÄØ‚Äî a deliberate counter‚Äëweight to Beijing‚Äôs Pacific ambitions. House Natural Resources leadership and subsea‚Äëmining start‚Äëups rallied behind the measure.

The budget carves a new channel.¬†The House‚Äëpassed ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù (May‚ÄØ2025) repeals the 10‚ÄØ% production credit (45X) created in 2022, arguing that a subsidy born in a climate bill no longer fits an ‚ÄúAmerica‚ÄëFirst‚Äù minerals strategy. In its place, lawmakers earmark¬†US$2.5‚ÄØbillion to buy domestically mined minerals for the National Defense Stockpile and US$500‚ÄØmillion for low‚Äëinterest Pentagon loans. The Senate draft, released 28‚ÄØJune, mirrors the stockpile money, adds US$3.3‚Äì3.5‚ÄØbillion in Industrial Base Fund grants, and folds in a US$5‚ÄØbillion¬†Defense Industrial Base investment facility. Passed on 1‚ÄØJuly by the narrowest margin, the text now heads to conference; if¬†[reconciled](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2236/2025-06-30-energy-sustainability-washington-update-july-2025), U.S. mineral policy will pivot from demand‚Äëside tax credits to¬†supply‚Äëside federal purchasing and equity stakes.

Defense bills converge on minerals.¬†Parallel FY‚Äë2026 authorization bills in both chambers authorize a¬†‚ÄúDefense Production Act Credit Program Account‚Äù¬†of¬†US$500‚ÄØmillion, channelling loans to lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare‚Äëearth projects. Bipartisan framing as a national‚Äësecurity imperative muted typical partisan fault lines.

# The Executive: Whole‚Äëof‚ÄëGovernment Acceleration

One portal, less red tape.¬†On‚ÄØ30‚ÄØJune President‚ÄØTrump¬†[issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/simplifying-the-funding-of-energy-infrastructure-and-critical-mineral-and-material-projects/)¬†the memorandum¬†‚ÄúSimplifying the Funding of Energy Infrastructure and Critical Mineral and Material Projects,‚Äù¬†mandating that Energy, Defense, Interior and peer agencies¬†share applicant data, halt disbursements to firms that refuse, and, within 180‚ÄØdays, launch a¬†single application portal¬†so miners and refiners can tap multiple programs with one submission.

DOE pivots to materials.¬†Five days earlier, DOE‚Äôs Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy¬†[released](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/energy-department-solicits-public-feedback-inform-2026-critical-materials-assessment)¬†an¬†RFI for the 2026 Energy Critical Materials Assessment, explicitly tying the work to Executive Order‚ÄØ14154 (‚ÄúUnleashing American Energy‚Äù). Secretary Chris‚ÄØWright has re‚Äëaimed FY‚Äë2026 R&D dollars toward geothermal, nuclear, and critical minerals, cancelling 24 climate‚Äëdemonstration projects worth US$3.7‚ÄØbillion.

*Permitting turbo‚Äëmode.*¬†After a 20‚ÄØMarch Defense Production Act invocation, four mining projects (three uranium in New‚ÄØMexico, one graphite in Alaska) obtained¬†**FAST‚Äë41**¬†status, gaining legally enforceable review schedules on a public dashboard‚Äîevidence that the bureaucratic gears are indeed speeding up.

*Pentagon capital.*¬†DOD‚Äôs Industrial Base Policy office highlighted recent¬†**US‚ÄØ$14.7‚ÄØmillion**¬†Title‚ÄØIII awards \[Fortune Minerals Limited (TSX: FT | OTCQB: FTMDF) cobalt, Lomiko Metals Inc. (TSXV: LMR) graphite\] and previewed forthcoming rare‚Äëearth separation and lithium‚Äëprocessing calls, signalling that the dormant National Defense Stockpile is poised for its largest restock since the Cold War.

# Courts & Regulation: Narrowing NEPA, Trimming Agencies

*Chevron‚ÄØdeference is gone, and NEPA just shrank.*¬†Two Supreme Court decisions now shape every mineral¬†[permit](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/05/supreme-court-limits-scope-of-environmental-review/).¬†**Loper Bright v. Raimondo**¬†(June‚ÄØ2024) ended four decades of automatic judicial deference to agency interpretation, while¬†**Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle‚ÄØCounty (decided 24‚ÄØJune‚ÄØ2025)**¬†[held](https://www.duanemorris.com/alerts/supreme_court_clarifies_narrows_nepa_scope_key_infrastructure_ruling_0625.html)¬†that NEPA reviews need not examine ‚Äúremote or speculative‚Äù upstream or downstream impacts. Agencies may focus on direct, on‚Äësite effects, erasing a litigation tactic long used to stall mines or refineries.

*Executive downsizing of BLM.*¬†A separate Supreme Court order (8‚ÄØJuly‚ÄØ2025) lifted an injunction barring federal Reduction‚Äëin‚ÄëForce plans, allowing Interior to proceed with layoffs that will cut \~1,800 Bureau of Land Management positions‚Äîeffectively shrinking the cadre that once policed mine permits. Critics fear weakened oversight; miners see a faster lane.

*NEPA roll‚Äëback on the table.*¬†CEQ‚Äôs interim rule (25‚ÄØFeb) rescinded prior NEPA regulations, and Interior‚Äôs May directive lets DOI waive or truncate reviews for ‚Äúvital‚Äù mineral projects. Word in Washington is that a full statutory NEPA waiver for minerals could ride on the defence bill; early court signals suggest a sympathetic bench.

# Money: The Federal Spigot Opens

Draft appropriation language authorises US$2‚Äì2.5‚ÄØbillion for stockpile purchases and another US$3.5‚Äì5‚ÄØbillion in grants, loans, or equity for mines and processing plants‚Äîcapital that commercial lenders view as loss‚Äëabsorbing first dollars. A new US$500‚ÄØmillion pilot lending program will test low‚Äëinterest debt for projects banks shun. Agencies aim to issue solicitations as early as October‚ÄØ2025 so money can land inside calendar 2026.

Public‚Äëprivate templates are multiplying. The U.S.‚ÄìCanada scheme that co‚Äëfunded Fortune and Lomiko is widely cited as a roadmap: bilateral cash, private equity follow‚Äëon, offtake contracts securing long‚Äëterm supply. Domestically, DOE‚Äôs Advanced Manufacturing Office continues seed grants‚ÄîUS$15‚ÄØmillion this month for grid‚Äëresilience storage systems that will absorb vanadium and lithium‚Äîand ARPA‚ÄëE‚Äôs MINER awards will inject > US$100‚ÄØmillion into green‚Äëextraction technologies for rare earths and battery metals.

# Trade: Detente with China, Alliances with Friends

*Rare‚Äëearth truce (for now).*¬†After Beijing throttled exports of rare‚Äëearth oxides and magnets in May‚ÄìJune, U.S. and Chinese negotiators agreed on an¬†**emergency 90‚Äëday reversal**. President‚ÄØTrump‚Äôs early‚ÄëJuly press conference¬†[claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-china-will-supply-rare-earths-us-allow-students-2025-06-11/)¬†‚Äúfull magnets up front,‚Äù but both capitals admit the arrangement is fragile; automakers have three months to build stockpiles before tariffs or quotas could re‚Äëescalate.

*G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan.*¬†Announced at Ottawa on 29‚ÄØJune, the plan commits members to pooled stockpiles, concerted investment in African and Latin American projects, and harmonised ESG‚Äëplus‚Äësecurity standards‚Äîpractical steps toward an allied alternative to China‚Äëcentric refining networks.

*Section‚ÄØ232 probe.*¬†The Commerce Department‚Äôs investigation into whether reliance on foreign refined lithium, cobalt, and rare‚Äëearth alloys threatens national security is due 12‚ÄØOctober. Should the verdict be affirmative, tariffs or quotas could follow, reshaping price curves overnight.

# Politics & Next Steps

White House messaging is unequivocal: critical minerals equal national security. Yet differences remain over method. Mining‚Äëstate Republicans hail the credit repeal; moderate Democrats warn that ripping away 45X could strand shovel‚Äëready projects. Former Senator Joe‚ÄØManchin, testifying on‚ÄØ20‚ÄØJune, urged a balanced mix of¬†**permitting reform plus stable incentives**. Consensus does exist on outcomes: de‚Äërisk domestic extraction, end single‚Äësupplier exposure, and restore industrial self‚Äësufficiency.

Agency road‚Äëmaps arrive soon. By late July, DOD will update its¬†**National Defense Stockpile Requirements Report**, possibly adding copper and zinc to the ‚Äústrategic‚Äù list. DOE‚Äôs 2026 assessment will redefine the ‚Äúenergy‚Äëcritical‚Äù roster next spring. A resurrected National Science & Technology Council subcommittee is drafting a 2025¬†**National Critical Minerals Strategy**, resetting targets for recycling, substitution, and workforce training.

# Why This Month Matters

A year ago, U.S. mineral security was a talking point. In the span of 30‚ÄØdays Washington produced: a seabed‚Äëmining bill; a budget that swaps tax credits for cash and stockpiles; an executive memorandum that merges siloed funding streams; Supreme Court decisions that neuter expansive NEPA challenges; agency moves to accelerate permits; and an international dance that alternates d√©tente with China and alliance‚Äëbuilding with G7 partners.

For investors, the headline is capital certainty: government purchase orders and grant money reduce project risk. For operators, permitting timelines now come with statutory clocks. For policymakers, the convergence of defence, trade, and climate narratives has forged an unexpectedly unified minerals doctrine. The next skirmishes‚Äîover 45X, over a possible NEPA waiver, over Section‚ÄØ232 remedies‚Äîwill decide how rapidly theory becomes tonnage. But the direction is unmistakable: America is remaking its mineral base, and the policy cement poured this past month will harden into the foundation of that effort.

[NioCorp Announces Pricing of $45.0 Million Public Offering of Common Shares](https://mailchi.mp/niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-pricing-of-450-million-public-offering-of-common-shares?e=8b2b97c99e)

**MY Speculation:**

**NioCorp‚Äôs new $45 million private raise via Maxim is strategically aimed at transitioning the Elk Creek Project into full ‚Äúshovel-ready‚Äù status.**

***\*\*\*This positions NioCorp to align construction timelines, reduce risk for lenders (like UKEF or DoD), and signal serious intent‚Äîmirroring MP Materials‚Äô phased strategy ahead of major government-backed financing.***

# ***GIVEN Shared responses below to questions asked May 22, 2025

***1) Is NioCorp continuing to work behind the scenes to complete final OFF-Take agreements for all probable Critical Minerals (Nb, Ti, Sc, REE's & Byproducts production) with both private & govt. entities? Can shareholders expect material news on the completion of such endeavors in the coming months ahead?***¬†¬†

***RESPONSE:***¬†

# ""Yes""

**Memory Transcription Subject: Ullr Hoback, Human KC Military Captain**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 17, 2160**

I slowly stir awake to a familiar weight on my back, but unlike most mornings, I know for a fact that I do not possess the strength to remove it from me, even if I wanted to. Her mass is like a hydraulic press confining me to my bunk. I let a ragged sigh go and curse under my breath. My back is in shambles, and the heavy lady currently resting on top of it carries much of the blame. Although I am definitely not innocent, as I was the one to suggest the physical activity in the first place.

*My body is broken. I should have known that being an old fuck would eventually catch up to me. Fuck skiing. This sucks ass.*

I give my best effort to stretch my legs, and immediately my back attempts to seize and fight against me. I let out a stifled cry as I raise my hand to the small of my back only to swat Artaya right in the face. My hand is quickly met by the sharp points of fangs as she nearly puts piercing pressure into my exposed palm. She tries to speak at me through garbled words while my hand remains perilously at her mercy.

‚ÄúUwllrh, ahm gohna gib oou wun hanse tuh eshpain wuhy oou jous swapp‚Äôd meh. Bwe vwery kerful wid yur wherds.‚Äù

*Should I be careful? Is sweet death the worst option here? I‚Äôll be confined to this bed for the rest of my life otherwise. Also, that voice is hilarious.*

I turn my head and face towards Artaya, who is staring me down with murderous purple eyes.

‚ÄúOkay, so you know how I‚Äôm old?‚Äù

Her ears flop backwards, and she releases my hand from her mouth as she tilts her head to the side.

‚ÄúOld? Aren‚Äôt you younger than me?‚Äù

*Ah, hell, bad start, but the hand is free. Push on.*

‚ÄúOof, anyway, this whole skiing thing we‚Äôve been doing for the past few days? Yeah, that‚Äôs a young person‚Äôs sport. My old and cold ass is ***not*** feeling it today. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to get out of bed, let alone back on the snowmobile.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ are you really that hurt? I-is it because you were carrying me?‚Äù

I slam my head into my pillow and take a deep breath as my unending stupidity dawns on me.

*Sonnuva fuckin‚Äô bitch. That right there is why she prefaced it with choosing my words carefully. Okay, turn back and give it a take two.*

‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not it at all. While it didn‚Äôt help, skiing is for people in a lot better shape than myself, especially if you‚Äôre doing it all day for three days in a row.‚Äù

‚ÄúInterrogation passed, Ullr, but this brings up a different topic; I guess we‚Äôre not skiing today?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a chance in hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, what do we do then?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòwhat do we do?‚Äô You‚Äôre the commanding officer here!‚Äù

Her head sinks down onto my back, and she closes her eyes for a moment in thought before she suddenly jumps off of me and onto the floor of the camper. I twist my aching back and sit up at a rapid snail‚Äôs pace to turn and face the now tippytoe-dancing officer fox on the floor.

‚ÄúWe can go patrol the closest city to here! It‚Äôs a very intriguing case of Jaslip ice belt civic design.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was, uh, Brother‚Äôs Gate, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you remembered! Do you think you know how to get back on that highway?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sure, but do you think we could get ready for the day first? I‚Äôll repeat that I‚Äôm not exactly feeling as energetic as you today.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nothing that a little breakfast can‚Äôt fix! Come on, let‚Äôs move!‚Äù

*Dammit, calm down. I‚Äôm going to collapse if I move much faster.*

As Artaya darts towards the dinette and takes her place on her side of the table, I slowly swing my legs to the floor and reach into the washer-dryer combo to switch from my night clothes to my day set of underlayers. I pretend not to notice Artaya‚Äôs gaze as I dress, but I quickly ready myself and shuffle over to the kitchen to start my cup of coffee. As the life-saving liquid brews, I reach into cold storage and bring out a slab of actual pork bacon fit for the finest greasy breakfast.

I sip on my coffee as the griddle makes quick work of the bacon strips, which are soon plated next to Artaya‚Äôs slightly warmed raw strips. I place the tray in the center of the table and take my seat across from her. She readily gobbles up her portion of the meal as I take my time slowly crunching on the greasy goodness.

‚ÄúUllr, this is the best bacon you‚Äôve made so far. It‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, of course you like it; all foxes love bacon.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me a fox, you obor.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I call you a fox; I‚Äôm not going to claim to be all that different than one of those things. Hell, there‚Äôs probably a bunch that are better than me at skiing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou kind of smell like one too.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo far, fox. Too far‚Ä¶‚Äù

As we finish our roasting session and meal. I reluctantly make one quick use of the restroom before securing the camper interior and then suiting up in my riding gear. With my helmet on, I step out to the safe glade where I had kept the camper the past few days. Already waiting for me outside is Artaya, who is sniffing around some trees on the far edge of the glade. I activate the radio and give her a call.

‚ÄúHey, Colonel, find anything interesting out there?‚Äù

‚ÄúNew smell. It‚Äôs vaguely similar to ker but also so very different. It might be a native Esquo breed.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop chasing those wascally wabbits and let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù

I finish readying the camper and snowmobile for travel as Artaya finally arrives back and jumps up into her seat on the snowmobile. I throw my leg over the seat and settle into place as I ease into the throttle and get the consist moving. Making a great big circle around the campsite, I pull back onto the old road that had led us here and start back towards the city of Sister‚Äôs Refuge.

The road, like all others we have encountered, is littered with broken-down trucks and sled vehicles, all wasting away to the forces of time and weather in this arctic land. By my reckoning, I take us through and near the city center once more to cut through the trafficless streets and pop back out on the highway heading up to Brother‚Äôs Gate. As we pass by a small but semi-familiar grouping of buildings, Artaya suddenly barks into the radio.

‚ÄúOh, Ullr! Before we leave, can you turn right down the next street? It‚Äôs my parents‚Äôs house again, and I‚Äôd like to see it one last time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, but ‚Äòone last time‚Äô? No plans to come back here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative. We kind of are supposed to be scouting the cities or something, and staying in one city out of thousands isn‚Äôt going to be a good look when someone comes to check on us.‚Äù

*Check on us? Check on us!? Hah, ever hopeful, my fox friend. There is no way we aren‚Äôt here for good unless that terrorist radio thing somehow actually does call us away.*

I turn the snowmobile and camper down the pitted street and find that the surroundings are indeed very familiar from our first day in the city. I slow the consist down right in front of the old building and park it while Artaya quickly hops down off of her seat and trots right to the edge of the sidewalk. She then slowly sinks into a sit and stares at the crumbling stone with a head tilt. As I walk up to join her, I hear a sound that has pulled at my heart since the first day I met her. I come to her side and sit down on the ground beside her and listen to her soft crying. I throw my arm over her shoulder and pull her in close as she cries through her helmet.

‚ÄúHey, Colonel, what‚Äôs got you all upset?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not right.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs not right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you have nothing to go back to on Earth, but we do. It‚Äôs right here; it‚Äôs all right here, and we pretend like it‚Äôs not. I know there are a lot of those Fed planets, but we have our own ships and shields. My family shouldn‚Äôt have been ripped away from a place like this. I shouldn‚Äôt be the only one to see it‚Ä¶ I miss them all so much‚Ä¶‚Äù

I take my arm and fully turn her into my chest as she cries it out. Despite her armored vest and my gloved hands, I try my best to stroke her back as she regains her composure. After a bit, she has gone quiet and makes an effort to pull out of my hug. She stands back up and takes a few steps forward before bowing and trotting back to the snowmobile, where she jumps back onto her seat. I slowly stand my sore self off of the frozen ground and wobble back to the snowmobile and retake my driving position.

As I roll down the street, a glimpse of heat in the helmet's HUD catches my attention, and I turn to see a hulking creature slowly pacing us behind the houses in the neighborhood. I form a gentle smile as I realize that Artaya‚Äôs guardian is still making sure we are safe but respectful of those that never got to leave. I take us back to a main boulevard, and soon enough we are rolling down the original highway we had taken in from the landing zone. I feel a snout boop into my back, and without slowing down, I wait for her to come over the radio.

‚ÄúUllr, I‚Äôm sorry about back there. I was jus-‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Colonel, no need to apologize. I‚Äôve done it as well this trip.‚Äù

*Yeah, dead kids all piled on top of each other. No more bunker tours for this guy.*

‚ÄúThank you, Ullr‚Ä¶ Say, Captain, why don‚Äôt you just call me Artaya all of the time?‚Äù

*I‚Ä¶ huh, she does use my name a lot, but she‚Äôs always been more open. Still doesn‚Äôt change my rank, though.*

‚ÄúColonel, I call you that for two main reasons: this is a military expedition and you are my commanding officer & it is your official rank, and I know you worked really hard to deserve the promotion. If you want me to only call you Artaya, let me know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I-I don‚Äôt know about the promotion; j-just go with Artaya, please.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, Colonel Artaya.‚Äù

‚ÄúH-hey, you‚Ä¶ Eh, whatever, Captain Asshole.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat I am! That I am.‚Äù

After a while of just ripping down the battered highway, we arrive at the bottom of the long mountain road. The weight of the camper strains at the motor on the snowmobile, but Alavel‚Äôs trusty iron steed powers up the slippery surface into the pass. We crest the top of the winding road, and as we drive on, I spot the busted-down rest stop where Artaya and I had taken that picture what feels like eons ago.

Artaya doesn‚Äôt comment on the sight as we roar on down and restart my favorite activity of scanning the road and dodging sketchy holes and burnt-out vehicles. As we round a bend in the road, I spot something I hadn‚Äôt wished to see ever again. A bus with windows splattered in what I understand is a horrid mixture of Jaslip and Resket blood. I slow the snowmobile down and point over at the sickening display.

‚ÄúHey, Artaya, is that bus really filled up that much with blood? What do you think happened there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really smell anything from it, but yeah, that looks like an akalet worth of Jaslip and Resket innards. My guess is it was transporting some resistance members and was stopped by Resket soldiers. You can imagine what transpired from there.‚Äù

*The locals give a nice Esquo welcome to the invaders from the stars, handing out eviction notices.*

‚ÄúFuck, and you all are supposed to somehow coexist as one big happy government now?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I‚Äôve said before, Ullr, the ones that weren‚Äôt leaving either died here or got shipped to Omnol, as far away from the rest of the Consortium as possible. Even then, terrorism from the Fighter‚Äôs Enclave is expected at this point, even if you‚Äôre not from there‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, if not for that reputation leading to you getting screamed at for nothing, how would we have ever figured out that you have all of the same scratch spots on your head as Earth foxes?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were assigned to the same room, so I think it would have come up at some point.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally, like you think I would‚Äôve just pet you at some point?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶ Yeah, that‚Äôs probably right.‚Äù

Letting the memory of my first day and our first encounter filter through my mind, I continue carving down the highway, mostly following the remains of the tracks we had left behind not all too long ago. I only give a quick glance to the mangled remains of the elk I had attempted to butcher. The image of the wicked akalet polar bear-thing flashes in my head, and I make haste to remove us from the area.¬†

**Memory Transcription Subject: Artaya, Jaslip KC Military Colonel**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 18, 2160**

The sun has long faded behind the thick tree line to the west, and Ullr‚Äôs head has been bobbing up and down in exhaustion for what feels like half of the evening now. His head nearly dips down to the handlebars, and we take a hard swerve, barely missing a rather egregious crater in the center sledway. With a huff, I tap my nose into his back and call into the radio over the whipping winds in our face.

‚ÄúUllr, I think that‚Äôs enough for today. Just find somewhere okay to pull off before we crash off.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I yawww, am fine for at least another half‚Äî‚Äù

My desire to see the morning overrides his desire to prove himself to no one as I take my jaws and place them precariously over his shoulder and into his back and chest. He takes a glance at me and his shoulders slump as he immediately peels to the side of the sledway into a small clearing free of any vehicles or shrubs. After the motorsled is in park, I hop down and make my way to the door of the camper, not even waiting for the stabilizers to deploy.

I quickly remove my vest and helmet as I dart for the comfort of the steam shower in the corner room of the camper. Closing the door behind me, it only takes a moment for the nuclear-warmed snowmelt to spray wonderfully into my tense legs. The soreness from riding on a hard, waterproof seat all day melts away as the steam parts through my coat. I don‚Äôt spend much time under the jets, but it‚Äôs enough to revitalize me as I step back out into the camper, where Ullr is already cooking dinner. The smell of seared beef makes my tails wag despite my distaste for the cooked meats; the smell is undeniably divine.

I hop into my bench in the dinette and watch in worry as Ullr‚Äôs head continues its bobbing while he cooks on the stove. His only jolts back to this world come in the form of hot grease splashing back onto his hands. Thankfully he is soon done with his own dinner of meat and greens as well as my plate of warmed ‚Äòtop sirloin.‚Äô He sets the plates in front of us as he takes his seat, and I waste no time in devouring the meal and chugging my water. He slowly eats through his plate, and as he finishes his food and drink, I decide to inform him of my plans for tomorrow.

‚ÄúSo Ullr, I think there‚Äôs probably only the rest of the morning for traveling, and then we should arrive at the South Vault Door for Brother‚Äôs Gate. From there, we can‚ÄîUllr?‚Äù

As I speak to him, his eyes slip closed and his head sinks into his chest. A pang of frustration quickly burns up and then fades out in my chest as my prepared plans fall on sleeping ears. I turn sideways to tap a tail on his face, but he doesn‚Äôt budge. With a sigh, I hop down and do my best to collect the plates and cups and put them in the sink.¬†

After making sure there‚Äôs nothing on my face, I walk up to Ullr and give him one more testing tap with a tail. Again, he doesn‚Äôt respond, and I decide to go through with my other plan. I use a tail to push him back into his seat as I jump up and onto his lap. Once I‚Äôm in a relatively comfortable position, I release him and let him fall forward onto my back.

*Hah, who‚Äôs sleeping on whose back now? I bet you-*

My own thoughts are cut short as I feel his arms wrap around my chest and he pulls his face down into the fluff on my back. I feel his gentle breathing go in and out of my freshly cleaned fur. I snuggle even closer to him and find my head tucked up into his arm. Closing my eyes, I feel content to drift off into sleep.

*I‚Äôll just tell him in the morning about the structure of Gate. For now, he needs his rest. Goodnight, Ullr. I hope you know there‚Äôs no one I‚Äôd rather be on this planet with.*

On a sunny February day, Daisy drove down a highway through the golden wheat fields of Kansas with Carter in his Porsche 356/2 Gm√ºnd Cabriolet. With the top down, Daisy's laughter filled the air as the wind blew through her hair, tickling her scalp. But she stopped seeing the look of abject terror on Carter's face.

""C-carter, sweetie, are you okay?""

""No, red, I don't think I am. I just realized I'm about to meet your mother for the first time, and I didn't bring so much as a gift.""

""Don't worry about that. Be your usual gentlemanly self, and Ma will love you. I have more to worry about than you.‚Äù Daisy spotted a mile marker, realizing they were still far from their destination. ‚ÄùCarter, please stop the car.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he stopped the car in the middle of the highway, driving off the road to the side away from any potential traffic. And she held his hands as she looked at him with a frown covering her face, though not the one Carter recognized.

""I've been too cowardly to ask, but now it's do or die. When you all assumed I was dead. How did Aisha and Belle take it?""

""I wish I could tell you. I learned from Belle when she sent me a letter. And maybe it was wrong, but I didn't keep in touch with them.‚Äù Carter took his hand from Daisy, placing it over his face. ‚ÄúWhen I thought you died, it felt like life didn't have meaning anymore. Except maybe for finishing the war and getting revenge.""

""Carter, let's promise ourselves something right now. No matter what happens in this war. We fight for justice and not revenge.""

""There's a difference?""

Daisy grew a scowl, pulling Carter‚Äôs hand from his face to see fury like he had never witnessed before from his lover.

""Justice is about doing what's necessary to protect the innocent. However, revenge is getting hedonistic pleasure from inflicting harm on another.""

As Carter heard Daisy, he looked at her with a nod followed by a small smile. Seeing him, her scowl disappeared, her usual light-filled smile replacing it.¬†

Daisy kissed Carter. ‚ÄùLet‚Äôs keep going.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù Carter gently brushed Daisy‚Äôs chin with his hand.

\*\*\*

Carter‚Äôs car stopped as their journey was at an end. The two exited the vehicle holding hands as they cautiously walked forward. The couple gazed intensely at their destination, Lilyville. And a great silence spawned between them as neither knew the words to comment on the settlement that stood before them. In many ways it was simple, but it was that purest of simplicity that made it stand out from among the other fantastic places they knew.

It was a small rustic midwestern town in the middle of a vast green field adorned with hundreds of heavenly peace lilies and sunflowers. The scent of the flowers bombarded Daisy with a wave of nostalgia for her upbringing. She looked toward the fields, remembering the community celebrations, the church functions, and family picnics. It was a homely and peaceful land devoid of even the tiniest trace of the violent war outside its border. Almost detached from the rest of time as it marched forward for everywhere else.

Daisy cried.¬†*""Home at last.""*

""I've never been anywhere like this before. And Daisy, do you hear that?""

Daisy positioned her ear to listen. ""I don't hear anything but the birds.""

""That's just it. There are no cars, trucks, or people shouting. It's as quiet as a grave.""

Daisy giggled. ""You'll get used to it, city boy.""

Daisy took Carter's hand and led him to her town, cracking a nervous smile. The couple swiftly approached Aisha's house. Every step Daisy took required herculean willpower, but as she got close, she faltered. However, with one kind look, Carter restored her resolve, and Daisy moved forward. But they stopped again momentarily as Daisy heard two familiar voices, Aisha and her father, Devon, participating in a shouting match.

*""Girl, leave this house and do something with your life,""*¬†Devon shouted.

""Daddy, what's the point? My best friend is dead, and nothing matters. I wish I had died too.""

Aisha stormed out of her house and slammed the door behind her. She quickly burst out in a rage, beating the door until she broke down crying, a sorrowful mess on the ground. Daisy looked at Aisha, miserable, and hurried over to her friend. She quickly reached Aisha and made her look at her. But as Aisha saw Daisy, she crawled away, her face losing color.

*""My god, a ghost,""*¬†Aisha said, terrified.

As Daisy heard Aisha, she took her hands.""Feel my hands, Aisha. I'm alive and well. So please don't say things like you want to die.""

Aisha quickly took note of Daisy‚Äôs hands. Unlike a spirit‚Äôs, her hands were warm and solid and she could notice the tremor of a pulse in her wrists. Her old friend was indeed alive. Aisha looked at Daisy as if she hadn‚Äôt seen her in eternity. Her eyes released a flood of tears, this time ones of joy, and she hugged Daisy tightly. Daisy reciprocated everything Aisha did. And the two young women clung to each other as they balled out on the ground.

\*\*\*

Daisy walked through the town with Carter and Aisha, heading toward her childhood house. As they made their way to the David family farm, they drew the gaze of the townspeople. And seeing Daisy back from the dead, they all hurried behind her to get an explanation for the miracle.

Meanwhile, Belle was still in bed even as the afternoon was minutes away. Surviving the deaths of her father and younger sister left her life without meaning. The young woman wallowed in her misery with her unkempt hair, malnourished body, and dirty nightgown in the loose bed sheets. She wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her days sleeping. But as Belle tossed and turned, she tumbled off the bed and hit the floor face-first. Belle burst into a crying fit until she heard a commotion outside. Using the last vestiges of her sanity, Belle struggled to her feet and staggered to a window to check. She saw Daisy outside with the crowd of townspeople, and life returned to her dead eyes

Belle dashed into the living room to her mother, Mary, on her chair. Mary was the spitting image of Belle but with Daisy's long, blood-red hair tied loosely at the end in a ponytail. She stared off into space, with her sunken, malnourished cheeks, clutching a frame with Daisy's baby picture inside as if it were the real thing. Like her eldest daughter, surviving her husband, Joseph, and Daisy‚Äôs deaths robbed her of much of her sanity. But Belle grabbed her hand, dragging her out of the living room.

Outside, Daisy prepared to open the front door. However, before she could, Belle and Mary ran out. And life quickly returned to Mary‚Äôs face as she saw Daisy standing before her.

Mary cried.¬†*""By the lord in heaven, he raised you from the dead and sent you back to us.""*

""I-I never died, Ma.""

""What?""

""It's a long story, but I managed to escape the Nemesis. I wanted to call you all sooner, but things happened.‚Äù Daisy cried, wiping tears from her eyes. ‚ÄúI am so incredibly sorry for putting you all through this torture. Can you ever find it in your hearts to f-"".

Belle and Mary swiftly grabbed Daisy, giving her a monstrous hug. They fell to their knees, holding each other tightly, and Aisha burst into tears upon seeing them. As Mary saw Aisha crying, she dragged her into it.

""B-but I don't understand. How can you forgive me so easily?""

""Sissy, you're back with us, so nothing else matters.""

""Your sister took the words right out of my mouth.""

""Ma, in that case, can you do something for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease make some of your delicious apple pie?""

Mary giggled.""Of course, sweetie, anything you want.""

The family continued to embrace each other more joyously than before. When the townspeople saw them, they burst into a loud celebration. But Carter stood close by quietly, wiping small tears of joy from his eyes, seeing the happy family together again.

On the western side of United Planets territory, the gears of war turned faster and faster as battle broke out. Space was ablaze as the forces of the United Planets and the Nemesis fired seas of plasma at each other at the border between their territories, known as the great schism. But as both fleets tried to annihilate the other, Damara flew to the enemy on Flaremane, breaking the dead-heat.

She grew her shield to a giant size and tossed it at the Nemesis fleet. It cleaved through their forces as effortlessly as a knife would cut bread, creating a fiery line of destruction across the war zone. And as most of the enemy fleet went up in an inferno, the survivors retreated.¬†

But Daisy gazed deeply upon the violence and death of war, sighing.

‚ÄúAt least we won.‚Äù

Later, Daisy flew through space and reached the homeworld of General Favian, Planet Aqua. The planet was a titanic marshland. Water covered its surface as dense vegetation with all its strange scents fostered life from it. A world comprised solely of vast swamps with little solid ground. The only exception was the giant plants on which the natives constructed settlements. She flew to the largest one, on a lily pad of thousands of miles in diameter, Palus Urbs. A colossal city using towering plant life as buildings.¬†

As she headed for it, she made her way through busy skies. Daisy evaded United Planets ships as they hurried to complete their missions. ‚ÄùSorry.‚Äù As per Favian‚Äôs strategy, several of the planet's cities became fortresses, converting the world into a military stronghold. It would allow them to defend Aqua better and support future attacks. Eventually, they could use the world as a launching point for campaigns into enemy territory without straying too far from supply lines. Daisy soon landed, and Favian ran over to her as she dismounted from Flaremane.

Daisy saluted the general. ‚ÄúGeneral Favian, my mission was a success. The enemy forces at the sector are in full retreat.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent, Damara, this will be vital for our defense.‚Äù Favian looked closer at Daisy, noticing the tiredness in her eyes. ‚ÄúSo why don't you look happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing, sir. It‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it affects you, I better hear it anyway to be safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know there‚Äôs no choice but to fight. But this war still feels wrong.‚Äù Daisy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúTo keep a long story short, my parents raised me to treasure life.‚Äù

As Favian heard Daisy, painful memories flashed across his face. ‚ÄùSo did mine. But unfortunately for the both of us, life isn‚Äôt fair.‚Äù

The two noticed a commotion nearby and spotted some soldiers chasing young aquis boys. But the little boys soon ran over to Daisy for refuge. As the soldiers reached them, Favian grew a scowl, shooting it at the soldiers.

""What are children still doing in this area? Especially since I ordered all civilians to the safe zone.""

""W-we were going to inform you about that, General Favian. The evacuation will take a bit longer than scheduled. As for those kids, they snuck past us when we were taking a little rest.""

*""Rest? Well, that's funny. Because Mavor won't rest until you are all dead.""*¬†Favian shouted.

""General,"" Daisy said, seething, holding the boys. ‚ÄúThere are children here.‚Äù

One of the boys tugged on Daisy's dress and got her attention. He spoke in the native language of Planet Aqua. But she was shocked as he didn‚Äôt say anything in Galactic Novice. It was a widely accepted tongue known to humans as simply English, but beings across the galaxy used it as an easy means of cross-species communication.

*""Ma'am, we're sorry that we broke the rules. We just wanted to meet you because you're a cool hero and super pretty.""*

Daisy cracked a smile as she finally recognized his tongue, uttering her next words in their native language.""I'm going to eat your souls.""

As the boys heard Daisy, they all burst into crying. And Favian's anger gave way to a sideways glance at his soldiers. But Daisy looked at their reactions, looking frantically between the two groups, unaware of what she said.

""D-Did I say something rude?""

Favian cracked a smile. ""Damara, please repeat what you said, but roll your tongue from the top of your mouth.""

Swiftly, Daisy heeded Favian's advice. ""You‚Äôre all sweet enough to eat. Bless your souls.""

The boys quickly stopped crying and grew big smiles. They all hugged Daisy, and she happily reciprocated.

""Damara, you'll save us. Right?‚Äù

""Yes, you'll be safe. I and many other brave men and women will make sure of it. And that's a promise.""

Daisy initiated a pinky promise with the boys. The boys quickly accepted it. As they did, Daisy was the only one who noticed her shield emitting faint light.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, thousands were scrambling across a military base outside the city. The United Planets base was situated on a lily pad several kilometers away from Palus Urbs of at least five hundred miles in diameter. It stood as the central hub of the Planets‚Äô military action on the world. Coordinating the movement of numerous smaller bases across the planet‚Äôs surface with Carter and Favian as the dual commanding officers.

With Carter in command of the base, as Favian was still in the city, he directed his forces in a race against time. However, they moved remarkably efficiently despite the mounting pressure, accomplishing their jobs. But Carter soon spotted a familiar face amongst the loud hustle and bustle. A timid and reserved-looking fellow knocked about in the big crowd. Eugene, eighteen, was a skinny Caucasian human man.¬†

Carter hurried over to him. ""Good to see you, doc Parker. How was the trip? I heard our species still doesn‚Äôt take to space travel very well.""

Eugene staggered back and forth, fighting the urge to vomit. ""You heard right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get used to it, soldier.‚Äù Carter chuckled.

‚ÄúGeneral Carter, may I ask you a question?""

""Shoot.""

""Well, first, I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is the chance of a lifetime.‚Äù Eugene vigorously rubbed the back of his head. ‚ÄúBut there are far more experienced scientists who would kill to be your head scientific advisor. So why did you choose me? All I did was crack that code for darkhold.""

""That code saved lives, Dr. Parker.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, I‚Äôm only eighteen.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoc, where I come from, boys need to become men fast.""

""Y-yes, sir.‚Äù Eugene exhaled heavily. ‚ÄúOh, before I forget, I completed that project you gave me.""

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

As an answer, Eugene quickly dragged over a rectangular case. As he opened it, Carter looked at its contents no different than precious stones. It was a sword unlike any other. A beautiful long blue shining blade with black circuitry shimmering below its surface. With a nod of approval from Eugene, Carter slowly reached for the sword. His anticipation rapidly grew as he got closer. Finally picking it up, Carter smiled at how comfy it felt in his hand.

""What a girl she is. Does she have a name?""

""Yes, she is called the Betanian blade. Light as a feather but strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast. And when you swing her hard enough, she emits a powerful energy attack.""

""Man, I've seen a lot of beautiful women in my time, but she must be the runner-up.""

""Why thank you, I-.‚Äù Eugene cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWait, you mean second? Who is the first most beautiful?""

Carter grew a smirk, thinking of Daisy. ""My business, that's who.""

Eugene saluted Carter, nervous as if he had done something wrong. ""Yes, sir.""

\*\*\*

The sunset and a horde of soldiers passed through the gates, returning from Palus urbs with Daisy and Favian leading them. And as Carter saw them, he hurried over.

""General Carter,"" Favian said indifferently.

""Favian,"" Carter said indifferently.

""So, General Carter, how was your end?""

""Pretty good, thanks to Dr. Parker. We're way ahead of schedule. How about you, Damara?""

""Not so lucky, I'm afraid. The evacuation will take at least another day.""

Favian swiftly walked away from Carter and Daisy.

""General Favian, where are you going?"" Daisy asked.

""There's something I need to check.""

Favian hurried across the base and quickly entered a building. Inside, he reached a computer room with rows of individuals typing away on the machines. And he soon found his Lieutenant, Yara. She was a beautiful Hachiko of twenty-four with a slender, curvy body that resembled a Siberian Husky.

Yara saluted Favian as she saw him. ""Glory to the lawgiver. Good evening, General Favian.""

""Same to you, Yara. Now tell me, how is General Carter's human doing?""

""Great. It's scary, but the guy can work our technology better than we can.""

Yara pointed over to Eugene on a holographic computer nearby. He stared at the big screen expressionless as his hands moved at inhuman speeds across the keyboard, inputting data. Favian looked at his work, his eyes widened, seeing him type away so fast without exhaustion. Almost as if Eugene was a machine himself.¬†

*""Dr. Parker, do you have a minute?""*¬†Favian shouted.

Eugene stopped working in a daze, clutching his head from a headache. ""Oh, General Favian, when did you get here?""

""About a minute ago. And I would like a progress report.""

""W-well, my guardian barrier should be fully functional by tomorrow. And thanks to Damara, we can cast it over a massive area without the Nemesis being an issue.""

Favian took a deep breath.""I see. Please, keep up the great work.""

Favian prepared to leave, but without warning, alarms went off. He stopped cold, but with one look at Eugene, he ordered him to search for the cause. And Eugene typed away like the wind.

""My god, colossal enemy troop movement,"" Eugene said.

""They're coming back in force? Yara, we're at priority red. Everyone to their battle stations.""

""No, General Favian, please stop. The Nemesis are in a mass retreat.""

""What?""

""Our scanners verify it. Entire fleets of enemy ships fleeing this part of space.""

As she heard Eugene, Yara smiled, saluting Favian. ""Congratulations, sir. It looks like your defensive strategy has already borne fruit.""

Favian‚Äôs features hardened, placing his hand over his mouth. ""That's the problem. It only looks like that.""",1,1752836024.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1m2z5hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1m2z5hc/the_white_whale_of_my_masters_degree/,The White Whale (of my Master's degree),"Hello friends! Was attempting to study and had to take a moment to vent instead. I'm currently feverishly trying to finish my degree that has taken me WAY too long before the end of the year. I've enrolled in and subsequently dropped off of (more like ghosted) courses multiple times and have a dozen grades hanging in the air, usually due to one or two missing assignments. Nevertheless, I have been in somewhat of a groove lately and have organized the missing grades and their assignments in my journal for an easier time and have worked on them in a diligent manner.

But there is this one course, one subject that has bested me every time I have attempted to do it. I have been on the lectures again and again on multiple semesters, but have never been able to do the work, so to speak. It is the one course that has frustrated me to no end, my white whale.

It is an **Introductory course on Special Education.**

Yes, I know the situation is ironic as fuck. I've tried to complete the course before and after being diagnosed with ADHD/Asperger's in my late 20s some four years ago. But no cigar. The problem is, that it is a mandatory part of my degree on art education.

So, *why* do I find it so challenging? Because every time I open the slides or watch recordings of the lectures, my eyes start to immediately gaze over. I literally feel an instant overwhelm and a tinge of a headache. The assignments required for completion are set up in a confusing manner. There are different requirements and assignments for students of the different curriculums that participate in this module ‚Äî which is fair enough ‚Äî but why in the hell don't they have a cheat sheet to see what is required from each of them? I have to comb through all the assignments included in the slides to delineate the things I have to do. Which wouldn't be so bad, if the slides weren't laid out **like an eldritch nightmare designed by M.C. Escher.**

The slides are ironically, _ridiculously inaccessible_; it's nigh impossible to get an overview of the contents with a glance. There is no consistency in the layout, no two slides look the same. Some have two columns, some have one, some have multiple ones that are all different sizes and all over the screen! In 90% of the slides there is a ton of text overlaid on stock symbols, in different font sizes, colors and configurations. Some quotations have been emphasized by giving them their own slides, but then they have a drop shadow applied, which in tandem with the (serif) font choice feel like someone is trying to gouge my eyes out with glowing tongs.

You might be thinking ""well at least a ton of text is still manageable if there isn't too many pictures, right?"" Worry not, since every inch of remaining screen real estate is filled with symbols, comic strips, clipart, diagrams to completely suffocate the text. I am not dyslexic myself, but these slides make me empathize with our fellow neurodivergent brethren.

If you read this post in full, thank you for indulging in my rant. Now I will have a cigarette, get a cup of coffee and get back to work.

TL;DR: I'm trying to power through a module on Special Education, and the materials are, ironically, thorougly inaccessible.",1,1752835970.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

I have chipmunks demolishing my flower and veggie beds. I've tried everything at this point to keep them away and I've essentially exhausted non-lethal. Feral cats pick off one or two on occasion but it seems like they get replaced by 5 more. I've smoked, filled & flooded their holes, and dispatched probably more than 40 of them in the past 2 years with the .22 calibers of justice.

The beds are raised, about 8 inches. Every single combination of fencing and netting measures has failed. They find a way through the fence, chew through the mesh and net, etc.

Bonide and other types of mace powder keeps the bigger kids away very well, including smaller squirrels which is weird, but not the chipmunks 

Cayenne, coffee, garlic, oils, etc... and even fox urine, the same

Fake predators- I came outside this morning and saw them literally sitting on top of the snakes and about lost my shit, which is why I'm posting. Plus the feral cats play with them amd run off with them sometimes, which is super funny and makes me laugh, but it's a little annoying. 

I absolutely will not plant mint as a border. I don't have to explain my reasoning to this group.

I refuse to use poison for obvious reasons, but I'm asking for lethal small trap recommendations. I  just want to avoid buying ones that are junk, so if you have or know of a good brand for outdoors use and you could post a link I'd appreciate it.

I am here with a question and I am happy to hear your thoughts. Here is my story

In our community we have this group of customers who are just ... I find it hard to describe in english: probably a mixture of¬†**Know-it-all + coffee lover + show-off + rude customer.**

As a coffee shop owner for almost 5 years (My coffee shop doesnt do espresso and only serve pour-over coffees), I get these types of customers quite a lot.

For example, a couple of years ago I had this couple walking into my shop. The lady was normal but her boyfriend or husband was that ""know-it-all"" guy I mentioned above.

He walked in, started to read the menu and asked me in a cold tone without even looking at me , ""what is the brewing temperature you use to make your Panama Gesha ?""

I said ""93 degrees celsius""

He replied with a rude scornful smile as if I said something so wrong, he said ""can you make one with 92 degrees? I only drink my gesha if it is brewed with 92 degrees. 93degrees will destroy the sweetness of the coffee.""

Then he turned to his girlfriend/wife, started to show-off he knowledge on gesha, things such as he had have hundreds cups of different gesha coffee from all around the world, he knew some coffee champions who make great gesha and etc..  
The lady was watching he saying all that, giving him an admiring gaze, as if that dude was explainning rocket science.

Well, I had to refuse because firstly, you had never tried my coffee with my brewing method before. You dont even know how fine I was going to grind my beans, how would you know that 92 degree brewing is better than 93? Secondly, if you are so professional and know so much about your coffee, why bother coming to a coffee shop which you dont even trust its barista's skill? Cant you just make your ""perfect coffee"" at home?

I kindly explain to him that I would make my coffee with my own standard because that's the purpose I open my own shop and serve customers with coffee with my own signature brewing style. If I made the coffee in his way but he didnt like it, we wouldnt know whose fault that would be.

Right after hearing my explanation, he got so mad and he face turned red. He grabbed his girlfriend's arm and walked out. He said he would never come again. (oh great!)

So here comes the end of my story. Do you have this same type of customers in your community? and what do you call them?",28,1752835807.0,barista,12,0.98,False
1m2z3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1m2z3mu/the_season_of_losing_friends_and_finding_myself/,The Season of Losing Friends (and Finding Myself),"**TL;DR:** Midlife loneliness feels brutal, but I‚Äôm starting to see it as a clearing ‚Äî a chance to grow, shed old patterns, and make space for deeper, truer connections.

\~\~\~

I used to think something was wrong with me.

That‚Äôs the only explanation my mind could offer for why almost all my friendships have evaporated. There was a time ‚Äî even into my 40s ‚Äî when I could gather a group of girlfriends for a trip to Costa Rica without breaking a sweat. Now, I can‚Äôt even convince one person to meet me for coffee.

It stings. Even as a shy introvert, I liked having people orbiting around me. But somewhere along the way, I stopped orbiting around them.

Maybe that‚Äôs what really happened.

Because here‚Äôs the truth I‚Äôve been reluctant to admit: most of my friendships weren‚Äôt healthy. They were built on my willingness to shrink, to edit myself, to swallow my own needs just to keep someone else comfortable. I didn‚Äôt realize how often I was camouflaging my true self ‚Äî wearing the ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù mask, laughing at things that weren‚Äôt funny, accepting crumbs of connection to avoid being alone.

But I can‚Äôt do that anymore. I won‚Äôt.

So here I am. Alone, but not lonely ‚Äî not always. Some days there‚Äôs grief. Other days, there‚Äôs a strange relief. Like my life force energy isn‚Äôt being siphoned off anymore. Like I finally get to keep it for myself.

There‚Äôs a season in a woman‚Äôs life where the phone stops buzzing. Invitations stop coming. Texts go unanswered ‚Äî or maybe they never get sent at all because you already know the silence waiting on the other side.

At first, it feels like rejection. Like a verdict on your worth. But what if this is actually a rite of passage? A sacred threshold into something quieter and truer?

On a podcast recently, I heard someone say that our souls choose mortal, aging bodies because we want to experience every stage of life fully. I think about that often. What if this post-fertile phase is meant to feel different? When we‚Äôre younger, there‚Äôs a certain energy we carry ‚Äî magnetic, fertile, vibrant ‚Äî that draws others in (and often attracts parasites).¬†

After menopause, that energy shifts. It can feel like doors closing. But what if they‚Äôre doors you no longer need to walk through?

These days, I walk through the world unseen in a way I never could before. And to my surprise, invisibility feels like a gift. I‚Äôm not scrutinized, sized up, or consumed. I‚Äôm free to just *be*.

This isn‚Äôt to say the loss doesn‚Äôt ache. There‚Äôs grief in the empty spaces where friends once were. But I also see now that this season ‚Äî this liminal clearing ‚Äî is not the end. It‚Äôs the space before the next crop is planted. A quieting of the field.

I don‚Äôt know what kind of friendships might sprout in the future. But I do know this: if they come, they‚Äôll grow from rich, authentic soil. No more tolerating what drains me. No more dimming my light for anyone‚Äôs comfort.

For now, I‚Äôm tending my own inner hearth. Learning to belong fully to myself. Sitting with the silence, and listening for the faint, steady drumbeat of what‚Äôs next.

My wife is a stay at home mommy, sometimes works a bit 

We have a 4 y old and an 9 years old

They go to school from 8am to 2pm

They are home at 3pm, and usually have a small lunch (because they dont really have a mid day lunch at school)

I come back around 7pm, and might have (2 times a week) work gatherings until 9pm let say

I can sense for a few months now that my wife feels that managing the nanny is not easy 

Nanny is full time she sleeps in our house
Her work schedule is roughly 7am 8pm 

Most importantly she cleans,  prepare school bags / lunch for kids 
Stay with them when we go out or wife goes out

What typical advice would you have to have this Nanny more efficient / autonomous ?

2 years ago with had a different Nanny who was more ""mom like"" a bit rough but had lots of initiative, it was a bit strange for my wife because the lady would just do it her way without asking

The one we had is much more discrete and quiet but,  I have noticed , but my wife says it surely, she is always asking / making sure she must do that "" madam, I do this now ? Madam , I do like that?"" Or "" sir, do i bring your coffee ? Sir I put the clothes away ?""

Are there general tips to apply (written schedule?l, etc ? ) for stay in full time nanny/maid?

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

What started as a streaming comparison quickly turned into something more‚Ä¶ intimate.  
Turns out I‚Äôm in a complicated relationship with two very different women.

Spotify  
She‚Äôs gorgeous.  
Always dressed to impress. Smooth UI, snappy menus, colorful playlists.  
She talks a lot ‚Äî maybe too much ‚Äî but she‚Äôs funny. She gets what you like (or thinks she does), she brings surprises every week.

But she‚Äôs high-maintenance.  
You stop paying attention for a bit and she gets passive-aggressive. Suddenly your recommendations go sideways. You get spammed with playlists like ‚ÄúMix 7 for you‚Äù, ‚ÄúGarage Psych Essentials (Probably)‚Äù, and worse ‚Äî AI-generated filler tracks disguised as actual music.

She‚Äôs fun.  
But she‚Äôs exhausting.  
You feel like you‚Äôre dating an overachiever who secretly flirts with your friends.

Spotify sings you sweet songs while you walk hand in hand through the city.

Amazon Music  
Now this one‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different.  
Let‚Äôs be honest: she‚Äôs ugly.  
Her app feels like something from 2011. You wouldn‚Äôt show her off in public.  
But she‚Äôs chill. No drama. No constant need for approval. She waits. Quietly.

And when you sit down and spend time with her?  
She opens up.  
Lossless, Ultra HD, Dolby Atmos ‚Äî formats you didn‚Äôt know you needed until you hear them. It‚Äôs deep, textured, almost too much for casual listening. And yeah, it‚Äôll eat your phone battery alive. But hey ‚Äî at least she doesn‚Äôt pretend.

Amazon Music takes you to an empty concert hall, hands you a studio-grade headset, and says: ‚ÄúListen to the air between the notes.‚Äù

And if I had to sum it up:

Spotify hands you a nice coffee in a plastic cup.  
Amazon Music serves you a fine espresso‚Ä¶ in an abandoned squat.

I haven‚Äôt made up my mind yet.  
One is intense and shiny, the other weird and loyal.

I am here with a question and I am happy to hear your thoughts. Here is my story  
  
In our community we have this group of costomers who are just ... I find it hard to describe in english: probably a mixture of **Know-it-all + coffee lover + show-off + rude costomer.** 

As a coffee shop owner for almost 5 years (My coffee shop doesnt do espresso and only serve pour-over coffees), I get these types of costomers quite a lot. 

For example, a couple of years ago I had this couple walking into my shop. The lady was normal but her boyfriend or husband was that ""know-it-all"" guy I mentioned above. 

He walked in, started to read the menu and asked me in a cold tone without even looking at me , ""what is the brewing temperature you use to make your Panama Gesha ?""

  
I said ""93 degrees celsius""

  
He replied with a rude scornful smile as if I said something so wrong, he said ""can you make one with 92 degrees? I only drink my gesha if it is brewed with 92 degrees. 93degrees will destroy the sweetness of the coffee."" 

Then he turned to his girlfriend/wife, started to show-off he knowledge on gesha, things such as he had have hundreds cups of different gesha coffee from all around the world, he knew some coffee champions who make great gesha and etc..  
The lady was watching he saying all that, giving him an admiring gaze, as if that dude was explainning rocket science. 

  
Well, I had to refuse because firstly, you had never tried my coffee with my brewing method before. You dont even know how fine I was going to grind my beans, how would you know that 92 degree brewing is better than 93? Secondly, if you are so professional and know so much about your coffee, why bother coming to a coffee shop which you dont even trust its barista's skill? Cant you just make your ""perfect coffee"" at home? 

I kindly explain to him that I would make my coffee with my own standard because that's the purpose I open my own shop and serve costomers with coffee with my own signature brewing style. If I made the coffee in his way but he didnt like it, we wouldnt know whose fault that would be. 

Right after hearing my explanation, he got so mad and he face turned red. He grabbed his girlfriend's arm and walked out. He said he would never come again. (oh great!) 

So here comes the end of my story. Do you have this same type of costomers in your community? and what do you call them? ",3,1752834709.0,SpecialtyCoffee,0,1.0,False

1m2yrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m2yrcq/qualitative_simplicity/,Qualitative Simplicity,"Here's my take. Started with [Coffeegeek.com](http://Coffeegeek.com), Chris Coffee. Isomac then a plumbed in Vetrano 20 years ago. Mazzer Mini with doser. At the time the doserless idea was just starting. But I liked grinding for multiple shots for family and friends so I stuck with the doser. My technique was a palmful of beans per shot. Add beans to portafilter. Level off with my finger. Manual tamp to 30lb, using a bathroom  scale to understand tamping  pressure. Almost always the top of the piston on my Espresso Parts tamper would be even with the top of the basket. Looked for a 20-25 second 2 oz pull. Interestingly, Jim from 1st Line seems to do this even today. 

Big debate at the time on Coffee Geek forums was flat or curved bottom. I wasn't sure and settled on a slightly convex one. I was making the best espresso anyone I knew ever had with a few varieties of beans from Paradise roasters or Nizza Lacolombe, from Phila area where I am. 

Fast forward. Vetrano fails after 18 years. And I have been watching Hoffman and Hendrik on youtube. 

New Vetrano, Niche Zero. So I get a scale to weigh my 18g. Normcore leveling tamper. WDT. Aiming for the 1:2  ratio 25-30 second shot. 

After a few weeks, I am not so sure that all this matters for a nice tasty shot straight or with some steamed milk cortado volume for my wife. 

I think the doser shakes up the finely ground coffee enough so that WDT isn't needed. And eyeballing 2 oz pulls still tastes great. 

I advocate a return to qualitative simplicity. That's what I am calling this method.  ",2,1752834590.0,espresso,1,0.67,False

1m2youd,https://i.redd.it/v0gt7avrzldf1.jpeg,Almond Croissant back in the UK,"It's not on the Nespresso UK website yet but is being offered to subscribers. I opened the app yesterday morning, spotted it, and promptly ordered 5 sleeves. They should be arriving in around 55 minutes and I can't wait!

It's only a matter of time before it shows on the website and becomes available to all. Seeing the return of Almond Croissant has renewed my hope that Peanut & Roasted Sesame will come back. üòä",7,1752834344.0,nespresso,6,1.0,False
