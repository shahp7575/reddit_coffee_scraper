I don't like how life is taking me on a trip I don't really like and not giving me 100%. I met my twin flame (a tattoo artist) in 2018 but before that I was already obsessed over tattoos on Instagram and kind of like what, how did you become this?. I don't know why God doesn't give me much. I mean, there's no art classes that are nearby (I don't have a car) and ongoing drawing. Maybe I just want to do therapy for now until I get a car. I was particularly heartbroken last night over a recent boy who rejected me. And I gave another one my number but he didn't text. Maybe he lost the note, but I didn't want to go back to the cafe he works at to ask. Life has just been so hard and also, I haven't been successful. I'm on a pension. Let's talk about this girl, she's a tattoo artist who got a tattoo from my ex when I was there at the shop, and ever since I met her I have been very obsessed with her and disappointed I'm me and jealous I guess. So painful. I feel like she is the gateway to my DNOTS. I wish I had had something all along that brought in the money and was something I was talented at like art. But I don't know if I should just go in to learning drawing for some pipe dream. Do you know what I mean. When I want to be like Ariana Grande and Doja Cat too. Anyway not sure who I am even because nothing is giving me a real sense of identity. Some days I really struggle to get out of bed over this. Not to mention the love of my life my psychiatrist from 2020. Just unhappy it has all gone this way and I wish I were a different person most of the time. I mean I just want to be special. But I don't feel like her or even other girls sometimes. Some people are so powerful and I'm a loser... I want to grow. But it's painful and I don't want to put more effort in and I don't have all the money in the world to do fun things. And today I found a feather on the ground. God is not very nice to me.

1ojvpp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ojvpp2/my_boyfriend_might_be_gaslighting_me_about_other/,"My Boyfriend might be gaslighting me about other women, but even then, I'm not sure if that's real.","Long one, sorry.

My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) have been together for just over a year, this October. I'll be honest, being with him has been quite stressful for me, for he tends to dismiss my negative emotions, and always want me to be happy and be the 'cool' girlfriend. When I'm not, we won't speak for days until he decides to say that I make him feel unloved and he doesn't want to be around me when I'm not happy. That being said, he can be sweet, thoughtful, and kind, and I try not to forget that when things go sour for a bit. He does do nice things for me, he holds my bag, buys me lunch/dinner, brings me coffee in the morning, always complimentary of my appearance, etc.

The issue I'm having recently, though, is that I'm starting to feel confused and unsure a lot because of things he's said that don't make any sense. That, and he can be randomly cruel with his wording. (context: he once told me I'm not fun to be around because I was having a really bad day. I was crying and he just said it really bluntly, then acted confused when I said that what he said was cruel.)

He tells me a story about another woman, but then will change details at another date thinking I won't remember the original story. When I question him on said details, he claims he forgets or has 'brain farts' and then will get defensive and shut down. Most recent event:

He pointed to a model on some poster in urban outfitters and said ""that's my friend."" and I was like, what friend, I've never heard you mention her before. He goes, ""Yeah I have, that's Emma."" I'm confused now. ""You remember, I'm really close with her mum, that's (mother's name's) daughter."" I go, you told me you weren't friends with the daughter, just the mum. He gets flustered, ""I knew her from school."" I ask if they're friends or not. He just says, ""I know her."" then quickly changes the subject.

(I checked him on this story a while ago because I asked him why he has kept in touch with someone's mother from school, as in calling her, having hour long phone calls, etc, if he is not close with their daughter. He said he knew it was weird but he just has.)

Mind you, a few weeks ago when I mentioned the mother by name, following up on a story he'd told me about some crypto invest scam she got sucked into, he was like ""Who...? Oh, you mean Emma's mum."" I just didn't say anything because I was like, why don't you know her name automatically?

So anyways, now I'm pissed off because it feels like he's lying to me. On top of that, he keeps mistaking his ex girlfriend's name for the girl he told me was 'just a friend' and who worked on a project with him in January. It happened once, I brushed it off, it happened twice, I took note of it, it happened a third time, now I'm staring into the void. Like he'll say, ""like this one time with (I'm just going to use their names, fuck it,) Emil- I mean, Amelia."" I understand they're similar but you dated one for 3 years, the other was just a friend. so...? What's up with that?

(for context: I had an issue with him spending time with this Emily girl because he was very oddly affectionate when talking about her, and it felt like -to me- that he was developing a crush on her. They were working on a video project for her business that she initiated, and he jumped at the opportunity. he's an amateur videographer, literally only just started as a hobby, and Emily is his best friends ex (they had a really messy breakup). I expressed it was low key weird she was so eager to work with him right after her break up, but he didn't seem to understand what I meant. We fought about this a lot, and he called me insecure and unsupportive of his dreams. Funny now since that project and Emily ghosting him after she got her video, he hasn't picked up that camera, or made a video once.)

The thing is, I don't think he's a cheater, or rather I didn't. But now I'm starting to wonder if he emotionally cheats, or has done so in the past, which is why he doesn't like to  talk to me about these issues when they come up, and will become very avoidant.

I really, and I mean this genuinely, do not care that he has female friends. I've met some who are kind, funny, and lovely girls who do not threaten me at all despite them being pretty, I'd actually love to be their friend, too. What I care about is how he goes about them, because if he is emotionally cheating or entertaining other girls, I want to know so I can leave him. If he isn't, then I'd like to try and figure this out, as I do love him, you know?

Anyway, I just feel very confused and disoriented. I'm trying to clear my head with some space but I'm too involved to see clearly. I want to hope he's not gaslighting me and making a fool out of me because he has some wonderful traits, but sometimes it just feels like something is going on and he's hiding it.",1,1761818970.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

Feel free to save it or share your own tips in the comments!



# ‚ö° Before the move

‚òâ Notify your landlord that you‚Äôre moving out and check the move-out instructions in your rental contract.

‚òâ Apply for a new daycare or school place as soon as possible (you can do it on your new city‚Äôs website, e.g. [helsinki.fi](http://helsinki.fi), [espoo.fi](http://espoo.fi), vantaa.fi). Inform the current daycare/school that you‚Äôre leaving, they‚Äôll help with the transition paperwork.

‚òâ Submit a change of address at https://www.posti.fi/muuttaminen. You can choose to forward your mail and update your address in DVV at the same time.

‚òâ Get moving boxes and wrapping film (you‚Äôll need more than you think). You can find them at Motonet, Biltema or Bauhaus.

‚òâ Initiate the deposit refund process with your landlord.

‚òâ Pause your gym membership, you‚Äôll get plenty of exercise anyway üòÖ

‚òâ Update your pet‚Äôs address in the official register, if applicable.

‚òâ Empty your storage unit or basement.



# ‚ö° Update your contracts 

>*Most of these updates can be done online in your account or by phone*

Before the move, also make sure all your main service contracts are up to date:

**üî∏Electricity contract**

‚òâ When you end your current contract, make sure to specify the exact last day in your old apartment so you don‚Äôt pay for extra days.

‚òâ Set up a new electricity contract for your new home. You can check the options at sahkovertailu.fi.



**üî∏ Internet contract**

‚òâ Contact your provider to check if they cover your new address, in many cases you can transfer the same plan.

‚òâ If not, compare providers in your new area and schedule activation before moving day to avoid downtime.



**üî∏ Home insurance**

‚òâ Transfer your current insurance to your new address or compare new offers at vertaa.fi/kotivakuutus.

‚òâ Make sure the policy is active from your move-in date, because some landlords require proof before handing over the keys.



# ‚ö° Moving day

‚òâ Book movers early (or prepare for a serious workout üòÖ). If you'd rather handle the move yourself, grab a few friends and rent a van it can actually be fun (and cheaper). You can find one on [gomore.fi](http://gomore.fi) or 24rent.fi. But we also can recommend Andrey‚Äôs team (+358 46 689 49 09), several people from our community have used their service and everything went super smoothly. They also shared a 10% discount with promo code Nerdsbay for moves across Finland and Europe.

‚òâ Plan parking for the moving van, especially in Helsinki and Espoo.

‚òâ Clean the apartment (hiring professionals can save you time and stress, highly recommend).

‚òâ Return all keys: double-check every copy to avoid extra fees. Take photos of the clean apartment and all facilities (bathroom, kitchen, balcony, etc.) so you can provide them to your landlord in case of any questions or claims about the condition.

‚òâ Pack a ‚Äúfirst night‚Äù box: tea, coffee, charger, toothbrush, fresh clothes and some snacks.



# ‚ö° After the move

‚òâ Unpack the essentials first: kitchen, bed and shower stuff.

‚òâ Check your internet connection on the first day.

‚òâ Inspect your new apartment and report any damages or issues to the landlord immediately.

‚òâ Double-check your electricity and insurance contracts at your new address (sahkovertailu.fi / vertaa.fi/kotivakuutus).

‚òâ Check that your address has updated correctly in DVV.

‚òâ Meet your neighbours (Finnish ‚Äúmoikka!‚Äù goes a long way üëã).

This is my first time posting on Reddit so bear with me, as it‚Äôs going to be a very long story, because I‚Äôm too emotional and need to write everything down.

I‚Äôll start with a little background.

So I (F29) have been friends with Emma (fake name, F29) for 15 years now. I used to think of her as one of my oldest, closest friends, but I‚Äôm not sure I do anymore, even though in her eyes I am hers. We met in high school, when we were 14 and became close, even though we‚Äôre complete opposites in almost every aspect. Being in a predominantly male school (technical education), where we were only 3 girls amongst all our pears and less than 12-15 girls in the whole school, has probably impacted my decision to become close to her, despite our very different characters and values.

I used to be shy (now not so much, just picky when it comes to people ), introverted, an excellent student and a people pleaser (which I still am, although I‚Äôm working on setting my boundaries in the last couple of years) and and a lot more reserved when it came to boys than her, whereas she‚Äôs always been a flirt, she‚Äôs very outgoing and talkative. 

We also come from very different families, which in my opinion plays a big part in the story. I come from a loving two parent family and I have 1 sibling, whereas her parents have been divorced for most of her life, her dad lives in another country with a new family (wife, 2 half sibling) and her mom has always been very hard on her, putting her in frankly dangerous situations, and very emotionally unavailable, which made her seek attention everywhere she could find it.

Since the beginning of our friendship Emma‚Äôs always been very jealous of other relationships I have with people in general, even trying to talk badly about my other girl friends, if she got the chance, but I‚Äôbe always been ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù - excusing her behavior, knowing that it‚Äôs hard for her in many aspects.

So, with that being said, let‚Äôs fast forward to our adult life. I started hearing from my family, my husband (M32) and my other very close friend Jenny (F29 - 10 year long university friendship) that she‚Äôs trying to copy my choices, my relationships, my life in general and that she‚Äôs comparing herself to me, but I‚Äôve always refused to believe it, again, thinking that they don‚Äôt know the full extend of her story, thus not giving her enough grace. But, as time passed, I also started seeing some of that, but never fully admitted it to myself.

A few examples:

‚Ä¢ I decided to pursue a degree in the technical field, because I enjoyed it. Emma did too, even though she hated it, and in our high school town, whereas I went to study in a bigger city with my then high school boyfriend, now husband.

For context: I dropped out after my 2nd year, even though I had a scholarship and was an excellent student, due to my father‚Äôs health and my mom‚Äôs need for help (she never asked, I just had the need to help out with the money I had earned during a summer abroad) 

‚Ä¢ I started a small business in the beauty industry (I‚Äôve always loved the artistic side of it) with part of the money me and my husband had left, which grew fast and I started making really good money. Emma thought about getting in the same field, but figured she didn‚Äôt have the patience and any interest in it so she went working as a hostess in a casino, where she made good money as well, but she kept comparing my salary (or what she thought I was making), to hers and started pushing me to open a spot for her to work with me and teach her as well, so she could earn even more.

‚Ä¢ I got engaged to my husband at the age of 22, she barely congratulated me and looked basically green with envy when she found out. At that time she was in another relationship with an older man that wasn‚Äôt working out, while simultaneously cheating on him with a guy our age).

‚Ä¢ I got pregnant and she got obsessed with my pregnancy, and even more with our baby when I had him - she called, texted daily, asking a thousand questions and wanting to be as close to him as possible, which I felt uncomfortable with, while simultaneously starting a new relationship with her now husband (about 12-13 years her senior) and trying to get pregnant within months of meeting him (succeeded getting pregnant in a few months and calmed down a little)

After the birth of our children, we kind of bonded again a little, due to being first time moms simultaneously and I finally thought that now that she‚Äôs married and has a baby, she would be fulfilled and happy, but then the financial problems started, because of her husband‚Äôs bad choices, while mine got to the leading positions in his company and started making more money, while mine worked really hard and got to the highest leading positions in his company, while I successfully monetized one of my more artistic/designer hobbies. I never bragged, I‚Äôve never discussed money or the cost of anything we buy (nothing fancy, just a little better quality than before), but Emma kept getting more and resentful, asking for the cost of every single thing we bought (including small baby book that cost less than $3!) and when I tried to change the subject she would find the price online just to tell me how she wanted to buy the same thing for herself or her son, but couldn‚Äôt which made me bad.

I used to be active on social media and post photos when we would travel somewhere fun and she would always make me feel bad that we‚Äôre somewhere she couldn‚Äôt afford. I stopped posting and deleting everything from my accounts,(because of this and because I started valuing our privacy) but she kept trying to track every step I took just to tell me how she‚Äôs upset that she couldn‚Äôt do the same. There wasn‚Äôt one good thing that happened to me that she could be happy about - her face would say it all, even before her comments, I could see it even from her texts. AND ALL THIS TIME I FELT BAD! I felt bad that she didn‚Äôt have the life she wanted, that she was unhappy in her marriage, while I was thriving in mine, that I had a hobby that brought me some income and she didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ all of it! The only times she was supportive was when I was going to a tough spot and she could relate.

So instead of taking a step back, I stopped talking about the good, and tried to make myself as small as possible, so that I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù her feelings.

I started working on technical projects with my husband. I loved it and focused of that, leaving my hobbies just as hobbies, which helped my constant exhaustion that I felt from juggling between being a full time mom (our maternity leave is paid for 2 years), housewife and a working designer/artist.

Our son is now 5, he goes to school, I am a housewife with a lot more free time. I feel peaceful, thanks to my husband providing for our whole family, while I keep working with him on some cool extra projects that bring us more money. Meanwhile Emma also managed to start a business and it‚Äôs going amazing! I‚Äôve been helping her with free logos, designs and everything that I could, because I wanted to see her fulfilled, happy and content for once in her life, as I believed that this would mend our friendship. Oh, how wrong I was.. now every time she asks me how I‚Äôm doing during the day, her answer is always ‚ÄúI wish I had your time, but I have too much works and no one to help me‚Äù.

The final straw was when she made a few snarky comments - once at my son‚Äôs birthday party in front of all our other friends, regarding me being her best friend who didn‚Äôt show up for her store‚Äôs opening (which I felt lawful about and profusely apologized for a thousand times before and after the fact, but since we had a huge family meeting with people coming from all over the country to our side of the family, that we had planned weeks in advance, I couldn‚Äôt not go to). Then two more snarky comments when she found out I saw two other friend for coffee on different occasions, instead of her( we didn‚Äôt even have plans together) and something in me switched. Seemingly for nothing. I told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate her jealousy over my friends and her guilt tripping anymore, while she tried to play the victim again and I just left the conversation. It was like I finally saw everything that I was choosing now to see and to excuse through all these years and now I can‚Äôt unsee it!

That was 5 days ago and I feel done with her. I know that I don‚Äôt want to reach out at all (though I think she will, very soon) but I also feel like I owe her an explanation, even though I‚Äôve seen her other friends having similar conversations with her about her behavior and them  being the bad guys in her story, so I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôs even going to try and understand me. Despite everything, I of course, still feel guilty and responsible for being so quiet and non-confrontational for so long, instead of putting boundaries, which would have maybe prevented this whole escalation in me.

So, AITAH for wanting to end my friendship with my high school best friend over these snarky comments?

I've been using kratom for about 3-4 years now, and it‚Äôs been pretty beneficial for me, but I can‚Äôt help but think about how quickly things can change with regulations and public opinion.

In my experience, I've found **clean energy** and a nice **mood lift** from strains like Green Maeng Da and Red Bali. I usually stick to a dose of around 4-6 grams, and it just helps me get through the day without feeling jittery like coffee sometimes does. I also love that I can rotate strains to keep my tolerance in check, which is super important for me since I want to keep my use responsible. 

But on the flip side, I know there are people who have had rough experiences with kratom or have had it negatively impact their lives. I‚Äôve seen posts where folks discuss dependence or withdrawal symptoms, which definitely gives me pause. I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge both sides; kratom isn‚Äôt a magic solution for everyone, and we should be careful about how we talk about it.

As for the petition, I get that a lot of us want to protect our access to kratom, but I‚Äôm curious about what others think. Does anyone else feel torn about the potential for regulation? I want to advocate for kratom while also recognizing that it‚Äôs not a perfect option for everyone.

We hit it off really well. She has a kid so only managed a 1 hour long 1st date but accepted a kiss at the end which is a good sign. Planned to see each other again the following week but when I was discussing what we could do I suggested I could cook her dinner. I didn't intend for anything to happen sexually but I can see how she felt that way. But given the conversations we were having before I suggested that I thought it was worth asking. I was getting mixed signals to say the least.

Anyway, that night she sent me a long message saying I hope what I find what I'm looking for and that she didn't want to come over and that we shouldn't continue. I was pretty gob smacked but put it down to her just being a bit crazy and didn't try and fight it.

2 days later she calls me and apologises saying she was a bit hormonal and jumped the gun, should have acted differently. I was like ok fair enough and we then planned the 2nd date at a nice Spanish place near us.

The date was incredible, I picked her up, kissed her, she put my hand on her leg, lots of touching a kissing throughout the night. I dropped her off and said she wanted to see me Sunday. I was debating asking to come in for a coffee but given the message she sent me before I gave it a miss as didn't want to be assuming even though the chemistry was defiantely there.

I sent her a message saying really nice to see you had a good night and hope she did too. She now hasn't replied which is very out of character for her as we normally exchange voice notes before she goes to work.

\---

I have been doing some reading into attachment styles and I realise I might be anxious attached. My last relationship wrecked me and I get so paranoid and fall pretty easily. It's something I've been working on as I don't want to sabotage my future dates.

I think she might be disorganised attached. Given her erratic push and pull out of nowhere. I'm just wondering if this type of compatbility can ever work. I do really like this girl but I just feel constantly anxious she's gonna sack me off at any time (although I convey confidence to her and others).

The main issue I have is she makes me feel so good when we are together and when we have texting sessions or phone calls. But the pull away absolutely kills me and I feel lost whether I should call it quits and find someone more akin to my personility or whether it's just me and I need to push down the anxiety.",1,1761817889.0,UKrelationshipadvice,2,1.0,False
1ojvdqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ojvdqt/my_girlfriend_of_5_years_left_me/,My girlfriend of 5 years left me,"I have never posted like this before. My ex of 5 years broke up with me a little over a month ago, and I am really struggling, now more than ever.

I do not know how to go on. I was not a perfect boyfriend these past few months, but I tried very hard. I was mentally exhausted from work and burnt out. My feelings were confused, and I was honest with her about it. I am autistic, so I struggle sometimes, but I never stopped loving her or telling her I loved her.

I miss how affectionate she was with me, in public and in private. I miss everything. She was my best friend and my family.

We decided together to start over, take things slow, and go on dates like it was new. I was excited, and so was she. Then she went to Paris with a friend. A day after she got back she texted me saying she thought we should break up. I was at the gym and had to hold myself together.

Right after that I felt kind of numb. A few days later I went to her place to get some things. We talked. We were intimate. She hugged me and called me pretty. While I was packing, she told me I would make a great dad. That broke me and I cried. She comforted me. When I left, I told her I loved her.

She then went to visit family in another part of the country. We had no contact for about a week, except once when I checked in to see if she was okay. When she got back, she texted that she was in the city again. For some reason that message crushed me.

Over the weekend I asked to call her because I missed her. I told her how I felt. I told her I wished she had not ended things and that I wanted to fight for us. Five years is a long time. She said her mind was made up and I could not change it.

A couple days later I picked up the rest of my things. She was cold and distant. She did not hug me unless I asked. She said she did not love me anymore and did not really find me attractive or miss my smell. She clarified that she did not think I was unattractive, only that she did not feel attracted anymore. It broke me. She had always said she would love me and be there for me. It feels like she abandoned me.

She also said she was burnt out. I told her I had been there too and had been working on it. I reminded her of how happy we were and how happy we could be again if she gave us a chance. I told her I would help her fall in love with me again. She was not interested.

She said she had a date lined up on Bumble and wanted to date casually. That hurts so much. I was the only person she had been with, and she had said she would never want anyone else. She wants to date casually but would not even meet me for coffee. Her mind was made up.

At one point during our relationship she told me she felt suicidal and was depressed. I loved her and I was scared. I also felt like I had become her therapist, which took a heavy toll on my mental health. I was honest about my limits and asked her to get professional help. She did, and she got better. She now says that was horrible of me, but I truly did the best thing I could think of to keep her safe and to protect my own mental health. I did not want to lose her from this world, and I did not know how to help beyond getting her support.

I do not understand how, after five years of planning a future, she could give up so easily. It hurts.

Part of me feels like a fool because I encouraged her to download Bumble originally. It is how she met the friend she traveled with. Now it is how she is dating. I keep thinking I caused this.

I feel broken. I can barely function. I am hardly eating and I am not sleeping well. Maybe it is my autism and I am hyperfixating on the situation. I am not sure. I just know I am hurting and I need advice.

I do not hate her. I hate myself for giving her the space to leave. I feel like if I had fought for the relationship the second she ended it, she might have come back. Instead, I let pride and hope get in the way. Now I feel like I have lost the best part of my life.

If you have read this far, thank you. Any advice on coping, healing, and not reaching out would mean a lot, especially from anyone autistic who has dealt with breakups and intense attachment.

These Car Air Purifiers Actually Work,"if you live in Delhi-NCR, you don‚Äôt breathe air anymore, you inhale regret. Step outside and the sky looks like it‚Äôs been run through a dusty Instagram filter. You can literally taste the smog some mornings. Coughs are the new ‚Äúgood morning,‚Äù and air purifiers are no longer luxury...they‚Äôre survival gear.

And if you spend hours in traffic like me, your car isn‚Äôt safe either. You roll up the windows thinking you‚Äôve escaped it, but nope. The pollution still seeps in. Every honk feels like a puff of PM2.5 right into your lungs.

That‚Äôs when I realized...if we‚Äôre cleaning the air at home, why are we ignoring the air we breathe inside the car? Especially when we spend half our lives crawling through Delhi‚Äôs gridlock. So I went down the rabbit hole of car air purifiers: what works, what‚Äôs hype, and what‚Äôs actually worth the money.

[Here‚Äôs the honest shortlist.](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=car+air+purifier&tag=rahulbhatia-21)..real people, real pollution, real results.

# 1. Reffair AX30 MAX ‚Äì Small but Mighty

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Reffair-AX30-MAX-Internationally-Aromabuds/dp/B0912WJ87V/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?tag=rahulbhatia-21&th=1)

Perfect for anyone who just wants a simple, budget purifier that actually filters the bad stuff instead of just blowing perfumed air.

**Why it‚Äôs good:** H13 HEPA filter tackles PM2.5 and dust like a champ. Plasma ion tech adds an extra punch. You can even drop in AromaBuds if you want lavender instead of exhaust fumes.

**Real talk:** Works beautifully in cars and small spaces, but don‚Äôt expect it to clean a living room.

# 2. Philips GP3601 ‚Äì When You Mean Business

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Reffair-AX30-MAX-Internationally-Aromabuds/dp/B0912WJ87V/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?tag=rahulbhatia-21&th=1)

This one‚Äôs for people who‚Äôve had enough of ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù

**Why it‚Äôs good:** H14-grade filter (yep, that‚Äôs the hospital-level stuff) catches particles as tiny as 0.004 microns. UVC light kills bacteria without producing ozone. Basically, clean air on steroids.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Daily Delhi drivers who want serious filtration, not just fragrance.

# 3. Honeywell Move Pure5 ‚Äì Reliable Everyday Warrior

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Launched-Purifier-Filtration-bacteria/dp/B0DRT91QSK?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Honeywell is like that dependable friend who doesn‚Äôt show off but shows up every time.

**Why it‚Äôs good:** 4-layer filtration removes dust, smoke, VOCs, and odors. Bonus...it‚Äôs got three USB ports. So you can purify and charge your dying phone during traffic jams.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Families or commuters who practically live in their cars.

# 4. Qubo Car Air Purifier Pro ‚Äì The Local Hero

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Qubo-Filtration-Technology-Pre-filter-Activated/dp/B0DHGFCG6P?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Made by Hero Group, this one‚Äôs an Indian brand that actually holds up.

**Why it‚Äôs good:** Three layers of filtration, negative ion generator, and easy maintenance. It doesn‚Äôt overpromise...it just quietly does its job.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Drivers who prefer an Indian brand with easy after-sales service and practical design.

# 5. Wellinzer TAG5 ‚Äì The Minimalist Choice

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Wellinzer-TAG5-Car-Purifier-Ionizer/dp/B0BFJ5TFTZ?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

For people who like their gadgets fuss-free.

**Why it‚Äôs good:** Uses negative ions to neutralize odors and freshen up the cabin. Doesn‚Äôt filter as deeply as HEPA models but keeps things feeling fresh.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Light users who want cleaner-smelling air without getting too technical.

# 6. Philips GoPure GP5212 ‚Äì Premium & Consistent

[üîó Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-Automotive-Lighting-Performance-Purifier/dp/B099HL5SV2?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

The ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù Philips purifier that takes air cleaning seriously.

**Why it‚Äôs good:** Strong HEPA filter, faster purification speed, and durable design. Handles long drives and tough conditions without losing efficiency.

**Who it‚Äôs for:** Drivers who don‚Äôt want to compromise on clean air‚Äîbudget be damned.

# So, What Should You Buy?

* If you want value and portability ‚Üí Reffair AX30 MAX.
* If you want powerful filtration ‚Üí Philips GP3601 or GP5212.
* If you want everyday practicality ‚Üí Honeywell Move Pure5.

Don‚Äôt overthink it...the AQI isn‚Äôt getting better while you scroll. Just pick one that fits your car and budget, and start breathing like a human again.

Yesterday the company shared the 3rd quarter results, showing the first operational profit per quarter (in last 10 years) and best quarter in terms of revenue and profit after the IPO - this already gives enough credibility to the management on management of turnaround - where they were since 2 years preaching, they will not prioritize growth over profit and they will work on sustainable profitable growth...

This quarter was the first implication of success that company announced first operational profit (3.1M USD , 3.8% constant currency, 7.1% reported).

The management also kept the guidance intact (they see the sell out data already for 2/3 of the quarter) ... Which means the Q4 profit will be 8 to 18M. In addition, since they delivered already 1.4% growth in first 3 quarters and Q4 historically the best quarter, they most probably will beat the growth guidance.

What else is happening:

1. They on board a new investor (Platin SARL acquired \~9% of the equity) in august/september. Also he announced additional purchase of \~1% worth of convertible shares... Platin SARL (Olivier Goudet) is a long term JAB Holdings veteran (owner of Reckitt,Coty, Krispy Kreme, JDE Peets, Pret-a-Manger etc...)
2. They restructured debt through Nordic bonds, the current debt is restructured with favorable interest rate. More importantly, they retired part of the convertibles (due 2028, so 3 years earlier than maturation). This shows their belief on ""not needing the cash for operations"".

In addition, they have much favorable unwithdrawn credit, conditional to 4 positive EBITDA quarters (and partial withdrawal possible). So , potentially after Q1 next year, they will be able to withdraw this partially, where interest will be substantially reduced.

3) They are running a strategic review on China business with JP morgan.

Above 3 might be the indication of a potential broader partnership / acquisition of JAB Holdings (either through JDE/Keurig coffee or beverages).

WHAT ELSE?

4) They are re-branding themselves from dairy alternative to lifestyle drinks. As dairy alternative they are already generating 1B turnover. Lifestyle angle will multiple the total addressable market & also a new world of higher margins (started with matcha in Europe).

If this is combined with manufacturing/distribution network of JAB companies, this will create a new Era of growth and reach...

  This is my first time posting on Reddit so bear with me, as it‚Äôs going to be a very long story, because I‚Äôm too emotional and need to write everything down. 

 I‚Äôll start with a little background.

 So I (F29) have been friends with Emma (fake name, F29) for 15 years now. I used to think of her as one of my oldest, closest friends, but I‚Äôm not sure I do anymore, even though in her eyes I am hers. We met in high school, when we were 14 and became close, even though we‚Äôre complete opposites in almost every aspect. Being in a predominantly male school (technical education), where we were only 3 girls amongst all our pears and less than 12-15 girls in the whole school, has probably impacted my decision to become close to her, despite our very different characters and values. 

 I used to be shy (now not so much, just picky when it comes to people ), introverted, an excellent student and a people pleaser (which I still am, although I‚Äôm working on setting my boundaries in the last couple of years) and and a lot more reserved when it came to boys than her, whereas she‚Äôs always been a flirt, she‚Äôs very outgoing and talkative. 

 We also come from very different families, which in my opinion plays a big part in the story. I come from a loving two parent family and I have 1 sibling, whereas her parents have been divorced for most of her life, her dad lives in another country with a new family (wife, 2 half sibling) and her mom has always been very hard on her, putting her in frankly dangerous situations, and very emotionally unavailable, which made her seek attention everywhere she could find it.

   Since the beginning of our friendship Emma‚Äôs always been very jealous of other relationships I have with people in general, even trying to talk badly about my other girl friends, if she got the chance, but I‚Äôbe always been ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù - excusing her behavior, knowing that it‚Äôs hard for her in many aspects. 

   So, with that being said, let‚Äôs fast forward to our adult life. I started hearing from my family, my husband (M32) and my other very close friend Jenny (F29 - 10 year long university friendship) that she‚Äôs trying to copy my choices, my relationships, my life in general and that she‚Äôs comparing herself to me, but I‚Äôve always refused to believe it, again, thinking that they don‚Äôt know the full extend of her story, thus not giving her enough grace. But, as time passed, I also started seeing some of that, but never fully admitted it to myself. 

A few examples: 

‚Ä¢ I decided to pursue a degree in the technical field, because I enjoyed it. Emma did too, even though she hated it, and in our high school town, whereas I went to study in a bigger city with my then high school boyfriend, now husband.

For context: I dropped out after my 2nd year, even though I had a scholarship and was an excellent student, due to my father‚Äôs health and my mom‚Äôs need for help (she never asked, I just had the need to help out with the money I had earned during a summer abroad) 

‚Ä¢ I started a small business in the beauty industry (I‚Äôve always loved the artistic side of it) with part of the money me and my husband had left, which grew fast and I started making really good money. Emma thought about getting in the same field, but figured she didn‚Äôt have the patience and any interest in it so she went working as a hostess in a casino, where she made good money as well, but she kept comparing my salary (or what she thought I was making), to hers and started pushing me to open a spot for her to work with me and teach her as well, so she could earn even more.

‚Ä¢ I got engaged to my husband at the age of 22, she barely congratulated me and looked basically green with envy when she found out. At that time she was in another relationship with an older man that wasn‚Äôt working out, while simultaneously cheating on him with a guy our age). 

‚Ä¢ I got pregnant and she got obsessed with my pregnancy, and even more with our baby when I had him - she called, texted daily, asking a thousand questions and wanting to be as close to him as possible, which I felt uncomfortable with, while simultaneously starting a new relationship with her now husband (about 12-13 years her senior) and trying to get pregnant within months of meeting him (succeeded getting pregnant in a few months and calmed down a little)

  After the birth of our children, we kind of bonded again a little, due to being first time moms simultaneously and I finally thought that now that she‚Äôs married and has a baby, she would be fulfilled and happy, but then the financial problems started, because of her husband‚Äôs bad choices, while mine got to the leading positions in his company and started making more money, while mine worked really hard and got to the highest leading positions in his company, while I successfully monetized one of my more artistic/designer hobbies. I never bragged, I‚Äôve never discussed money or the cost of anything we buy (nothing fancy, just a little better quality than before), but Emma kept getting more and resentful, asking for the cost of every single thing we bought (including small baby book that cost less than $3!) and when I tried to change the subject she would find the price online just to tell me how she wanted to buy the same thing for herself or her son, but couldn‚Äôt which made me bad. 

 I used to be active on social media and post photos when we would travel somewhere fun and she would always make me feel bad that we‚Äôre somewhere she couldn‚Äôt afford. I stopped posting and deleting everything from my accounts,(because of this and because I started valuing our privacy) but she kept trying to track every step I took just to tell me how she‚Äôs upset that she couldn‚Äôt do the same. There wasn‚Äôt one good thing that happened to me that she could be happy about - her face would say it all, even before her comments, I could see it even from her texts. 
   AND ALL THIS TIME I FELT BAD! I felt bad that she didn‚Äôt have the life she wanted, that she was unhappy in her marriage, while I was thriving in mine, that I had a hobby that brought me some income and she didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ all of it! The only times she was supportive was when I was going to a tough spot and she could relate. 

 So instead of taking a step back, I stopped talking about the good, and tried to make myself as small as possible, so that I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù her feelings. 

 I started working on technical projects with my husband. I loved it and focused of that, leaving my hobbies just as hobbies, which helped my constant exhaustion that I felt from juggling between being a full time mom (our maternity leave is paid for 2 years), housewife and a working designer/artist. 

  My son is now 5, he goes to school, I am a housewife with a lot more free time. I feel peaceful, thanks to my husband providing for our whole family, while I keep working with him on some cool extra projects that bring us more money. Meanwhile Emma also managed to start a business and it‚Äôs going amazing! I‚Äôve been helping her with free logos, designs and everything that I could, because I wanted to see her fulfilled, happy and content for once in her life, as I believed that this would mend our friendship. Oh, how wrong I was.. now every time she asks me how I‚Äôm doing during the day, her answer is always ‚ÄúI wish I had your time, but I have too much works and no one to help me‚Äù. 

  The final straw was when she made a few snarky comments - once at my son‚Äôs birthday party in front of all our other friends, regarding me being her best friend who didn‚Äôt show up for her store‚Äôs opening (which I felt lawful about and profusely apologized for a thousand times before and after the fact, but since we had a huge family meeting with people coming from all over the country to our side of the family, that we had planned weeks in advance, I couldn‚Äôt not go to). Then two more snarky comments when she found out I saw two other friend for coffee on different occasions, instead of her( we didn‚Äôt even have plans together) and something in me switched. Seemingly for nothing. I told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate her jealousy over my friends and her guilt tripping anymore, while she tried to play the victim again and I just left the conversation. It was like I finally saw everything that I was choosing now to see and to excuse through all these years and now I can‚Äôt unsee it!

  That was 5 days ago and I feel done with her. I know that I don‚Äôt want to reach out at all (though I think she will, very soon) but I also feel like I owe her an explanation, even though I‚Äôve seen her other friends having similar conversations with her about her behavior and them  being the bad guys in her story, so I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôs even going to try and understand me. Despite everything, I of course, still feel guilty and responsible for being so quiet and non-confrontational for so long, instead of putting boundaries, which would have maybe prevented this whole escalation in me. 

   So, AIO for wanting to end my friendship with my high school best friend over these snarky comments?

Hi, i m looking for someone to spend some good quality time with mostly online but anything works for me. Short or long-term both works for me again. i m bit Ambivert (extrovert sometimes but most of the time i am just an introvert who hates to talk) but also not much out going, unless in a good company where we both can be comfy. more of a chat person initially, but once i open up to you, means i have started trusting you n all (typical introvert me eh?).  


i m quite funny i would say, who mostly likes to joke around, unless you are a serious recipient for some reason (may be you are entitled to something i m unaware of, so pls refrain if you are the serious types). its going to be a mutual hand-holding in tough times of solitude. its fine if u just want to check out if it works or not, but pls put least efforts, else lets save each other the hassle eh? At least with some efforts communication often tends to be interesting for both of us.

  
wouldnt want to comment anything my physical appearance here, as i m not looking for anything NSFW as of now. can definitely share on-demand or if we get comfy with each other. lets keep it casual like friends? Sometimes although we have friends irl, it feels like sometimes with online connections it would be easier to open up, especially it‚Äôs a no judgement zone.

i m really informal in Hindi, trying to learn it but not strong in it. Movies, sports, finance, health, music, tech domains me kaafi interests rakhta hu. but if u wanna talk/rant/open up abt anything, i m all ears. just looking for another human existence on other side of the chat. Also I am more of a fitness lover these days who enjoy going on walks and works outs at gym. I play sports on weekends and sitcoms are my energy pills that keep me happy whenever I am sad, a good lover of coffee and a big foodie. Travelling in free time is one of my fav thing, where I have had some thrilling stories experienced.

I am looking for someone around my age and even older than me, even if you are in your 30s or 40s but wanting a online friend you are always welcome to dm, just be a nice person that it. But generally 20+.  Thought of making it M4F initially but realised I do actually need few friends of my gender too, bros are also very much important.

1ojv19h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1ojv19h/treatment_pathways_for_physical_anhedonia/,Treatment pathways for physical anhedonia.,"I am autistic, I'm currently waiting on a referral to be screened for manic depression. And I have crippling insomnia. When I was young I had these huge emotions that took me over. And though they are still there, they're not. I am on a path to being T-Total (smoking is my last vice and I'm collecting some nicotine replacement therapies). When I was about 24, I was doing party drugs (mainly pills), and what was about probably wasn't MDMA, and I took stupid amounts chasing highs, until one day, I took stupid amounts of actual MDMA, I didnt seek medical attention, but I overdosed. The 'up' from pills was always very binary, it was at a level. But this was different, the up kept going and it felt like something was giving under the rise, it felt like brain damage. Like pure blinding euphoria I was fitting all night at home. I have essentially walked through nearly 40 years of trauma. My ex partner was ill, she was diagnosed with a auto-immune disease of her liver, but her symptoms were rather vague, pain, her bones and cartridge degraded so she would get breaks easier and her hips kept dislocating. She was told for about 5 years it was in her head. To a point she could barely get out of bed. We both progressed drugs wise up to heroin near the end. Then a doctor told her she would need a liver transplant within a year. And she took her life. I was homeless following that. Until my brother offered me a room in a different county away from everything and I put that part of my life behind me. I was always huge as a kid but when I got clean I was 6 stone and Im a fairly big guy, I always loved cycling but from then started long distance and got fairly fit. I started properly chasing long term work as I had cared for my partner going in 6 years. Between the overdose, and getting clean 7 years later was...a blur of drugs. So I mean these symptoms were probably there, but from that point I needed to collect myself and work on my issues. 7 years ago now. The biggest problem was insomnia, I don't mean struggling to get to sleep till 5 am, I mean, for example right now, I've been awake 36 hours, when I crash I'll probably sleep more than 24. I've been cycled round drowsy anti-depressants and anti histamines ect ect until right now, they do nothing, and I've got to a stage where I can't work because of it. And doctors won't prescribe anything without some proof its more than being up because I'm anxious, I've been through every trigger 1 by 1. I've tried cbt for all it was worth. Talking therapies. I've at last had a doctor that hasn't dismissed it as too much coffee or anxiety (I am sometimes awake due to being anxious over something, but I know when that happens. most of the time, my head is completely empty trying to sleep).

I've lived 10 lifetimes in the past 7 years, I can't be in my hometown, I've moved a lot, Ive been happy, mostly sad, I've been in love. I've been hurt. If you take away the euphoria from happiness, and don't know the triggers, its amazing just how close the physical response is to anxiety. (Apart from how I act as a result). If you take the spectrum of an emotion, from the neurotransmitters flowing through you, the physical response to them; shakiness, heart rate, to the effects on your behaviour, to the feeling of that emotion. I experience every type of emotion I have not walled off happiness (I mean right now I might have but thats beside the point), I have been happy. But my head is empty. To be in my head, feels like I'm standing in a room with my back to a door. Its blinding white, and deafeningly silent. I can feel something is trying to break the door down at my back, every now and then it shoves me so hard I fall down, but it never breaks the door, and it never makes a sound, and I'm trapped. My screams are silent. Every now and then when the door stops silently banging, I can hear impossibly soft whispers. Emptiness, deafening emptiness. No matter what emotion I'm experiencing, I feel nothing. The only feeling I have left is crushing sadness, or nothing.

Around 8 months ago I had a rollercoaster love, I fell so deeply. And I felt, I don't know what it was, it was like the base of an emotion, like euphoria without euphoria, a part of love that normally you can't distinguish from the whole it just partly makes up the feeling. I felt SOMETHING. And as quickly as she came into my life, she was gone. Id been clean for 6 years but I found out she was secretly using, she was a nurse. She messed with my head. And those 6 years, for a few times over a month were broken. She opened something that I can't close. Right now my life is crushing sadness or emptiness and I think I'm holding onto the sadness because the alternative is worse. Nothing. I did coke for a month or 2 trying to get away from my binary feeling existence or trying to get away from (or maybe fill?) the hole she left. That's not me though and it doesn't work. I don't want the emptiness (but that's not the answer) and I don't know if I can live the rest of my life like this. Not the sadness screw that, sadness will pass eventually. The deafening silence.

The symptoms I'm describing are in so many medical reports of case studies of acute serotonin syndrome. From the insomnia, to my head being flat an empty. I may have psychological anhedonia right now, but I also have physical anhedonia. And no matter if things improve and this sadness lifts, I know it will never be replaced by actual happiness. Like feeling happy, feeling anything. And right now my insomnia is killing me, my tablets slowly lost effect from before I was with her, and I had a good job as a customer service advisor for OVO energy for going on 2 years and my insomnia spiralled as tablets stopped working, and its the last straw. I've lost so many jobs to this over the past 7 years while doctors act like it could miraculously stop tomorrow and as they take their time deciding on if I should have other medication; my life falls apart. My last doctor that made a referral to a psych agreed it could be driven by manic episodes and the results of serotonin syndrome, but the treatment depending on if I'm manic depressive or not, could be harmful if for example I'm not  manic and given meds for it. So until I'm seen he wont prescribe anything. But every time I mention physically anhedonia they gloss over, this isnt something a psychiatrist can fix. I mean they will be able to help with aspects of it... the point to all this is not sympathy. I want to know the path to answers, I need answers. How do I get in front of a neurologist?",2,1761816456.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

The whole time we were together, he was distant emotionally unavailable. I kept trying to reach him, to make things feel real, but it was like loving a wall that only reflected silence.

Then he started spending more time with my sister. At first, I thought it was harmless coffee, small talk, family stuff. But slowly, it started to sting. He‚Äôd bring her chocolates, compliment her, light up when she walked in‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôd just sit there, invisible.

She never encouraged it she was just being polite. But I could see how differently he treated her, how his eyes softened for her in a way they never did for me. 

Now that it‚Äôs over, I keep wondering why I stayed for so long.",1,1761816331.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I‚Äôm not conservative and I‚Äôm not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I‚Äôm not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don‚Äôt report this post if you don‚Äôt like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don‚Äôt appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!",1,1761816215.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

The clock ticked just loud enough to remind you it was still working, even if you weren‚Äôt. A half-empty cup of coffee sat on the desk, gone cold hours ago, but still holding onto the illusion of productivity. Outside, nothing much happened‚Äîclouds drifted by with the lazy confidence of things that have nowhere to be. Inside, you stared at the same sentence for the third time, wondering if boredom was a form of quiet rebellion or just your brain buffering.

today kate had coffee, still eating 'gently' but did get the coffee and a shower.  The window is open and the sun is on her leg GOSH that feels so nice and warm.  Goal of the day is to make it out to her recliner.  IDK about clothes because shes still wearing a towel and her hair is a mess.

I'm slightly happy the woman cant walk and is experiencing the shits.  I'm thrilled shes depressed and sad and has at least 58 more days of this confinement.

**Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game of Cat-and-Mouse**  
Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: Australia is the statistical heavyweight here. In 60 Women‚Äôs ODI meetings, they‚Äôve dominated India 49 to 11‚Äîa margin so lopsided it makes a ‚ÄúFinals Four‚Äù look like a friendly pick-up game. Australia‚Äôs current squad, led by Ellyse Perry‚Äôs tactical genius and Alyssa Healy‚Äôs return to form, is a well-oiled machine. Their all-rounders, Ashleigh Gardner and Annabel Sutherland, are the sports equivalent of Swiss Army knives‚Äîuseful in batting, bowling, and probably even making coffee.

India, meanwhile, are the underdog with a ‚Äúwe‚Äôve-got-nothing-to-lose‚Äù edge. Their resurgence in the tournament is inspiring, but the absence of opener Pratika Rawal (injured) has left a hole in their top order. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur, though, is chasing cricketing immortality, aiming to replicate her 171\* heroics from 2017. The key for India? A stable opening partnership‚Äîwill they go all-in on Shafali Verma‚Äôs explosive but risky flair or play it safe with Harleen Deol? It‚Äôs like choosing between a rocket and a tricycle.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and the Weather**  
India‚Äôs woes? Pratika Rawal‚Äôs injury isn‚Äôt just a loss‚Äîit‚Äôs a plot twist. Without her, their top order is a reality TV show: chaotic, unpredictable, and likely to end in tears. Harmanpreet will need Smriti Mandhana to deliver a masterclass in calm under pressure. Radha Yadav‚Äôs improved bowling is a silver lining, but can it contain Australia‚Äôs lethal batting lineup?

Australia‚Äôs Alyssa Healy is back, and her return is like a lighthouse in a storm‚Äîreassuring, bright, and slightly terrifying for opponents. Their unbeaten tournament run? A testament to their ‚Äúwin-at-all-costs‚Äù ethos. But let‚Äôs not forget: this is Navi Mumbai, a venue with a DLS-revised past. The weather forecast? A 25% rain chance‚Äîenough to make fans reach for their umbrellas and gamblers second-guess their bets.

There‚Äôs a coffee shop in the same plaza as my work, it was a very slow day so I walked over to get some. When I walked out, I heard screeching. I immediately knew what kind of animal the screeches were. it was coming from a car that just pulled into the plaza. in fight or flight I yelled at the guy ‚ÄúDID YOU JUST RUN OVER A CAT??!!?‚Äù (Sorry bud) I looked up and down around the car, the screeches persisted so i told him to pop his trunk. I see a little kitty in his engine pit, i reached in despite the heat but she escaped out the wheel well.

She ran across a busy parking lot, i chased her, great clips workers came out and pointed me in her direction (she was tiny i lost sight of her twice) then someone walked out of a business and the door opening stopped her in her little tracks. I picked her up, held her for the last hour of my shift (first pic), and took her home with me. Her paw pads were burned, whiskers singed, hungry and barely holding on. 

After fleas & 7 ticks, one botfly, cleaning up the digested bugs she pooped on us, clavamox & deworming, lots of love, food and water- she‚Äôs the cuddliest, silliest, sweetest little girl ever. She‚Äôs the third addition, and the little sister of our two other rescued boys (neutered). All babies pictured at end ü´∂üèº",15,1761815460.0,cats,4,0.95,False

Why don't they just change the timetables to take into account that there is a little less need during half term?

I just wanted to thank everyone who commented and gave me advice on my last post ‚Äî I really appreciated the different perspectives. A lot of you said his behavior definitely seemed like more than just friendship, and that I should look for consistency in how he treats me versus others.

This is the link to my post if anyone wants to read it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1obyuei/i\_think\_my\_coworker\_might\_like\_me\_but\_i\_cant\_tell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1obyuei/i_think_my_coworker_might_like_me_but_i_cant_tell/)

So‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened since!

After my last post, George and I kept getting closer. We still text every day ‚Äî usually him starting the convo ‚Äî and he still does little things like bringing me coffee or snacks when he knows I‚Äôm working late. Well, he started something new. He would walk with me to the bus stop which was 2mins away from our office and would wait with me until the bus came, especially if it was 10 or 11 in the night. We also went to see that movie we talked about (and yes, it totally felt like a date). He paid for my ticket and food, and he was definitely more affectionate ‚Äî holding my hand, even brushing my hair behind my ear, that kind of thing. 

After the movie, he admitted that he really liked me and had been trying to show it without making things weird at work. He said he didn‚Äôt want to cross any lines since we technically work together, but he couldn‚Äôt help getting attached. He said he genuinely enjoys being around me and feels like we just ‚Äúclick.‚Äù and that he's not seen someone as smart and hardworking as me. Fyi, I am majoring in a criminology honours program with a minor in political science and he found that extremely fascinating and attractive. I was extremely shocked by everything and didn't really know what to say (I was screaming internally). 

Since then, we‚Äôve been taking things slow. We‚Äôre not officially dating yet, but we‚Äôre definitely more than just coworkers or friends now. We‚Äôve talked about keeping things professional at work and so far, it‚Äôs been fine. Although we did inform our respective supervisors and they were super chill about it! Only one colleague, the one who always shipped us knows that we're more than just friends/coworkers and has kept it a secret.

So to everyone who said it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust friendly energy,‚Äù you were right! Thanks for helping me open my eyes ‚Äî turns out, sometimes it really is what it looks like ‚ù§Ô∏è

Apparently, other regulars started thinking I was some kind of ""productivity guru"" because I'm always there working on my laptop looking focused. People began sitting near me, ordering the same drink, and even copying my setup (laptop, headphones, notepad).



Last week, the barista told me there's now a whole group of people who come in asking for ""the corner guy's usual"" and they've started calling themselves ""The Focused Collective."" They even made a group chat and have been discussing ""my methods.""

1ojuo7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1ojuo7d/observations_on_visiting_china/,Observations on visiting China,"My first four week visit to China was enjoyable. The Chinese people were friendly, helpful, and pragmatic, often willing to assist without expecting anything in return. They also seemed relatively easy-going and patient.

The country felt remarkably safe. I was struck by the high level of public trust, with people often leaving bags unattended, seemingly without concern.

Another surprise was the prevalence of basic English, which was more common than I had anticipated. Those who were fluent in English were very eager to interact.

Getting around China is relatively easy. The high-speed rail network connects many cities, though air travel is still much quicker for long distances. The train generally has three classes: Business, First, and Second. Second class, which is used by most people, is more than acceptable. Booking directly through the railway website was difficult. The English version of the site kept reporting it was overloaded, while the Chinese version was difficult to decipher. Third-party booking sites were the most convenient option, despite their service fees.

A highlight was cycling around Beijing, which felt very safe.¬†

Public transport in cities is also straightforward. There is no need to buy individual tickets. You can use a payment app (I used the AliPay app and found it convenient), which also works on buses. In some cities, it was also possible to tap a payment card (a paywave credit card) directly at the turnstiles.

China is effectively a cashless society. In four weeks, I did not use any physical money, instead using AliPay linked to my credit card.

The tourism market appears to be dominated by domestic Chinese travellers. I was surprised by the lack of international tourists, particularly from western countries. Most foreign visitors I saw were from Vietnam or Russia.

While transport is easy, visiting some government places/sites is a challenge. Many government-run tourist attractions require a reservation one day in advance. The registration process was not always straightforward, as the ID requirements often seemed designed for domestic tourists, making it difficult to register with a foreign passport.

The standard of food, including food safety, seemed good. It was not hard to find vegetarian food, and many places were accommodating.

Hotels were mixed. While some were very good (for example, offering a free supper service of noodles and congee), others were variable. A common frustration was central air conditioning -¬† despite a control unit in the room - it was often impossible to adjust the centrally set temperature.

Smoking is also a significant issue. Many people smoke, particularly men, but also women. This often affects hotel rooms, and it might be best to request a non-smoking room. I stayed in one hotel where the lingering smell of smoke was so strong that my pyjamas stunk of cigarettes the next day, making me suspect the bedding had not been changed.

Toilets were also mixed. You can find some of the cleanest, best-maintained toilets in the world, yet also encounter some of the worst. A public toilet block in the Muslim quarter of Xi'an, for example, had an overpowering stench that made it unusable for me, though locals seemed unfazed.

I observed several social customs that differed from my own. It was not uncommon to find people sleeping on the job, with workers napping in shops, pharmacies, and restaurants.¬†

I was also surprised by the amount of spitting on the street, which I had assumed public education campaigns had reduced. I also observed a tendency for people to push in crowds rather than wait their turn. This could be off-putting, but it appeared to be a social norm.

It is common to see high-tech jobs existing alongside unskilled street labour, such as people collecting cardboard on bicycles. While city centres are clean, some rural areas, particularly off minor roads, have a lot of rubbish dumped on roadsides and in waterways.

While it has enormous and modern railway stations and land transport infrastructure, I was struck by the frequent use of remote stands by aircraft at airports. Airlines often parked on the apron away from the terminal. Passengers then had to board a bus, which, given the size of the airports, added considerable time to the journey.

China is complex. It is described as ""communism with Chinese characteristics"" and there are subsidies to stimulate consumer demand. There is a huge market for luxury goods, with high-end shopping areas featuring all the major international shops and brands. American chains like Starbucks and Pete's Coffee are also prevalent.

I also saw some inventive coffee drinks, such as coffee mixed with orange juice or jasmine tea. I even saw a ""cheese coffee,"" though I was not keen to try it.

While travelling by high-speed train, the number of coal power stations was striking. It seemed we passed one every few minutes. The landscape, particularly in rural areas, is also strewn with a massive network of power lines.¬†

Air pollution was noticeable in Shanghai, Beijing, and Xi'an. However, I was also surprised by how leafy and green the cities were. I wondered if this extensive tree coverage was an attempt to mitigate (or camouflage) the pollution above the canopy.

I personally found the media and television not good. Television was dominated by Chinese movies and dramas, and the English-language newspapers I read, like the China Daily, seemed to consist of banal government propaganda and I did not find it interesting or insightful.",3,1761815022.0,travelchina,6,0.8,False

1ojuhco,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1ojuhco/hope_this_helps_you/,Hope this helps you,"I've posted here a few times and I sometimes found comfort, sometimes got even more scared :D But today I want to tell you about what happened to me yesterday because it might help you if you feel scared.

Long story short, for the past 5 years I've had PVCs, well, actually, PACs with isolated PVCs. I have them 10-15 days per month and those days they last 12 + hours. They come in rounds too (one after another). Sometimes, I get runs of very fast, irregular beats that last a few seconds but that are pretty scary. The Holter showed that the burden on those 2 weeks per month is quite high (8K).

Yesterday I had an additional check up with a new doctor. She said that in spite of all the burden all these years and the scary patterns, my heart is perfectly healthy, the structure is OK and it works full power. I couldn't believe it as I have so many and so frequently but it seems you can really have a normal life without impact as long as your heart is structurally healthy and you don't have other underlying conditions.

Stress is the biggest trigger. Coffee, chocolate and spicy foods. And, when the burden is high like in my case, beta-blockers. They increased my dosage as it was too low but they said they are protecting my heart long term.

Check with your doctor, if everything is fine, take it easy. Hang in there.",2,1761814283.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False
1ojugbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1ojugbo/do_you_have_to_use_the_word_date_for_something_to/,"Do you have to use the word ""date"" for something to be a date?","TLDR: invited a guy on what I thought was a date, turns out he assumed it was a friendly hangout and even talked about his partner (which I didn't know about). How to make intentions more clear without being too straightforward?

Hi all, would love some perspective on this situation.

I (31F) am from Latin America and moved to Melbourne almost 3 years ago. I met a guy (29M) through a sport we both practice, he has always been polite and friendly towards me, but we are not super close. He is Australian and has been practicing this sport for over 15 years, and I started last year. I've always seen him as a sort of mentor, he is clearly passionate about it and I have learned so much from him. My romantic interest in him is very recent, but I have a deep admiration and respect for him, and probably wouldn't have continued practicing if not for his patience and encouragement.

Anyway, as I mentioned, I've recently developed some feelings for him. A mix of curiosity, physical attraction, wanting to know him better. I think one day I just looked at him more carefully and noticed stuff that I found endearing (like how his hair tone is different in some parts of his head, or a small cheek dimple that is kinda hidden by his beard), and it grew from there. Another person from our sport group said he was single, so I texted him on Whatsapp the other day asking if he'd like to grab a coffee sometime. Now, I did not use the word date, but given that we are both single and I'm inviting him to a 1-on-1 thing, in my mind there was clear indication (or at least reasonable doubt) that this was not just a friendly hangout. He replied positively, said it sounded lovely, suggested a day and place, and I agreed to it. I was very much under the impression that I was going on a date, so I did my hair nicely, dressed a bit nicer than I would for a meeting with friends, stuff like that.

We met at a cafe near my house, I was so excited and nervous. I really wanted to spend time with him, to get to know him better, to see if he thought of me as possibly more than a friend. It was going so well, then about 20 minutes into the conversation, he casually mentioned his girlfriend of 6 months. I tried my very best to keep a straight face but my mind was like, what??? What are you doing here if you have a partner?? Why didn't you mention this when I asked you out?? Anyway, we still spent an hour talking after this, he paid for my coffee even though I said he didn't have to and hugged me goodbye, saying it was lovely to see me. I was just so confused. When I told everything to an Aussie friend (39F), she pointed out that if she had received the text that I sent him, she would have 100% assumed it was a friendly hangout, like 'oh she is a foreigner in this country with not many friends and probably looking to connect with people from our shared group, we get along well so she just wants to talk' and not the 'she is a single woman asking me out, so she is possibly interested in me' that I had intended. In general, in my country, men in relationships don't go to 1-on-1 hangouts with single women, or they would bring up their partner much much sooner in conversation. If I had known that he had a partner, I wouldn't have invited him.

Obvs I won't pursue this particular man, but going forward, should I change my approach? Should I say from the start that I mean a date, not just a coffee with a friend? Is it awkward? I'm just trying not to be in this situation again. Appreciate all your opinions ü©∑ thank you!",32,1761814167.0,AskAnAustralian,64,0.92,False

i was diagnosed about 5 years ago AuDHD. psychiatrist thought i had ADHD, i thought i was autistic, turns out we both won!!


anyway, i recently moved across the country for a work promotion with my fianc√©e and our cat. we left our friends, family, even the *climate* (which i miss, it‚Äôs too hot here).  i‚Äôve managed to hang out with a few of my coworkers after i inserted myself into their hobby. i dedicated an entire weekend learning about it so i could seem somewhat competent and i‚Äôm actually quite good. but i really want deeper interpersonal connections. i have no friends that i can actually confide in or talk to. i only have my fianc√©e and i can‚Äôt expect her to listen to every little problem i have.


the main problem is that i don‚Äôt know how to start a conversation, introduce myself, make plans, where to naturally interject in a conversation, and unfortunately, i have a slight processing delay so i get lost when people talk. the biggest source of my anxiety, though, is introducing myself. meeting people is an absolute nightmare. i need to be introduced by another person or just blurt out ‚Äúhey i have no clue who you are, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù or even ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù. this would be fine, but my tone is never correct so i think i come across accusatory in a way.


i recently asked instagram what i should do, but the general consensus was not tism friendly. ‚Äúgo to bars‚Äù, ‚Äúgo to clubs‚Äù, ‚Äútalk to people at coffee shops‚Äù, etc. my fianc√©e even tried inviting me to some party, but all of that sounds like a nightmare. loud environment, unpredictable, strangers, TALKING to the strangers, impulsive masking, probably not able to bring my stim toys without looking weird, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot.


despite all of that, i really want companionship and community. do y‚Äôall have any advice for me? have y‚Äôall had success making friends or meeting new people? have you moved far away from home?",1,1761814128.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1ojuc1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1ojuc1m/entitled_neighbor_told_me_to_close_my_curtains/,"Entitled neighbor told me to close my curtains because my living room ""offends her""","So I moved into this duplex 4 months ago. Nice area, nothing fancy, rent is already ridiculous so I was just happy to find a place. My living room window faces the side of the house next door, but there is a fence and like 3 meters between us. I keep my curtains open during the day because light is free and I work from home. Sometimes I eat on the couch, sometimes I watch Netflix in pajama shorts, very shocking behavior.



Yesterday the lady from next door knocks and opens with ""you need to keep your curtains closed when you are walking around, my kids can see you"". I thought she meant like naked or something. Nope. She meant me existing. She said her 10 year old asked why ""the man is always sitting there"" and now she has to ""explain lifestyle choices"". My lifestyle choice is paying rent and drinking coffee on my couch. She then suggested I ""just use the blinds like everyone else"". I said no, I like sunlight. She said then I should pay to tint the window so ""we all have privacy"". We. All.



I told her nicely that if her kids are staring into other peoples windows that is not my problem. She got mad and said she will talk to the HOA. Joke is we dont even have a HOA. It is just two houses. She walked off saying I am being inconsiderate. Maam, your son is literally watching MY TV from YOUR yard, who is invading whose privacy here.

Hopefully, this helps someone else who‚Äôs struggling to lose weight or just needs a push to start.

# üí™ My Starting Point

Three months ago, I weighed around **210 lbs**. I felt tired all the time, and even walking up the stairs made me short of breath. 

# ü•ó My Diet Plan 

* üçé **Calorie Deficit:** I tracked every meal using MyFitnessPal. Most Reddit users recommended staying 500 calories below maintenance.
* ü•¶ **Protein First:** I increased protein to stay full longer ‚Äî chicken, eggs, Greek yogurt, and tofu became my go-tos.
* üíß **Hydration:** Drinking at least 3 liters of water daily helped reduce cravings.
* ‚òï **Cutting Sugar:** I stopped drinking soda and replaced it with black coffee and green tea.

# üèÉ My Workout Routine

I didn‚Äôt join a gym at first. I started small:

* üö∂ 10,000 steps a day 
* üèãÔ∏è 20‚Äì30 minutes of home workouts (bodyweight exercises)
* üßò Stretching before bed

After 6 weeks, I added strength training three times per week. It made a huge difference.

# üî• Results and Motivation

After 12 weeks, I lost **30 pounds** ‚Äî from 210 lbs to 180 lbs. The best part? I feel healthier, sleep better, and have more confidence.

Whenever I felt like quitting, I‚Äôd read new **weight loss success stories on Reddit**. Seeing people who had lost 50‚Äì100 lbs kept me going.

1oju9km,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1oju9km/recovering_from_gerd_with_ocd/,Recovering from GERD with OCD,"Hello everyone, I recently was going through some past bookmarks and came across this subreddit again, and I figured that I would write my experiences with GERD, and how I was able to heal from it in hopes that it'll help others who are in a similar situation. 

I first began experiencing symptoms in university in my early 20s. It would manifest as just heart burn, and I chalked it up to just having too much coffee/alcohol, as it would just occasionally flare up, but then quickly go away. Then in my first internship it got significantly worse. I was under a lot of stress, drinking a lot of coffee, getting very little sleep etc, and a few months in, I started developing stomach issues. Everytime I would eat, I would become nauseous after, get stomach pain and immediately have to go to the bathroom. I developed IBS/Gastritis-esque symptoms, I'd constantly feel like I'd have to go to the bathroom, but without actually ""going"" to the bathroom, it got to a point where I had to constantly be sniffing rubbing alcohol, just to make it through a day at work without nausea. 

Covid happened, the internship was cancelled and I had essentially 4 months off, and in those 4 months I cut out coffee, any acidic foods, and my stomach seemed to generally heal, and I forgot about it for around 2 years. 

Then prior to graduation, I started developing GERD symptoms. I was under a lot of stress from job hunting, exams, graduation, and to make matters worse, I was trying to eat a lot to bulk at the time, which led to me eating large portions, and then falling asleep soon after from how tired I was. It began with the IBS/Gastritis esque symptoms again, but then soon after it developed into GERD. My symptoms included 

* Waking up with heartburn
* A lot of burping
* Bloating 
* ""Acidic"" feeling on an empty stomach 
* Nausea after eating
* Sharp stomach pains after eating certain foods
* Sore throat
* Headache, sore ear/tonsils

It was taking a big toll on my mental health, and it also prevented me from lifting heavy weights as well, as the bracing for squats/deadlifts would also lead to more heart burn. I started questioning whether I would ever recover, and it combined with some other mental health factors led to me spiraling from it.  I didn't take PPI's, but at my worst I had to take H2 blockers everyday, as well as Pepto to get through the day.

I really do feel that mental health was a really big factor for it. I didn't know this at the time, but recently I was diagnosed with OCD, and I had this ""cycle"", where I would get some symptom, my health OCD would flare up and I'd think ""Cancer, you're going to die"", which in turn would make my mental health worse, which would then lead to worse symptoms. 

What helped me recover was a few things. 

1. I started working on treatment for my OCD, and attempting to reduce the level of stress/anxiety in my life. I do recognize how ""just don't be stressed"" sounds like, but if this sounds familiar, not just with OCD but other mental health conditions and stress, take some steps to find coping mechanisms of any sort. Whether that be meditation, walks etc, anything. Even meditation before bed, I started noticing a really big difference in how my throat would feel the next morning. 

2. I started an incredibly strict elimination diet. I ate incredibly bland, same thing everyday, cooked with just salt, and then slowly, very slowly started reintroducing ingredients to see if I could tolerate it. Finding ""safe"" foods was incredibly important for me, as it provided me with a baseline. A few things I noticed was I followed the normal low FODMAP diet, but noticed that certain foods, even if it was considered ""safe"" online, would trigger my acid reflux. What foods you can tolerate, and what triggers symptoms I found to be very individual, so you have to experiment with it. I had a food ""diary"" where everyday, I tracked exactly what I ate, how much, and how my condition was for the day. that helped me pick out certain patterns, and ""narrow"" my diet. 

3. In terms of supplements, I SWEAR by L Glutamine. L Glutamine by far, had the biggest impact on my stomach health, L Glutamine + Psyllium husk(fiber in general), had the biggest impact.  I also took probiotic/prebiotic, but to be honest I'm not really sure if it had any real effect on me. Another thing that really helped out was broths. Before going to bed on an empty stomach, I'd get an ""acidic"" feeling in my stomach, and drinking broths before really helped sooth it. 

4. Absolute no food for at least 4 hours before sleeping, and sleeping on a slanted surface. 

It took about 4 months of above to get to a point where I could function without H2 blockers, and then 4 more months where I could begin having foods that previously gave me flare ups in moderation. Then, after an additional 6 more months, it got to a point where I was able to eat without generally thinking about it, only occasionally getting heartburn when eating something spicy, drinking a lot, having a lot of coffee in one week etc, and now, 3 years after starting my elimination diet, I am back to normal, able to drink coffee, alcohol, eat anything without pain. Very occasionally, if I'm stressed and and am eating like shit, I do feel a tiny bit of heartburn, but I would say I'm 99% better. 


I know this sounds very cliche, but if you're going through something similar, stay strong and you WILL heal. Maintaining a positive attitude can be difficult, and I've been guilty of having episodes where I just say ""Fuck it, who gives a shit, I'm just going to eat whatever I want, and suffer, I'm never going to get better"", but being determined to get better will help you stick to these habits, and ultimately lead to recovery. 

Obligatory Disclaimer: Not medical advice, I was very lucky in fact that I was able to heal this without PPIs, or surgery, and it wasn't anything serious like cancer. Please do seek medical help if you find there's no improvements, or it gets worse.",2,1761813383.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been in India for only two days now and have started my trip in Jaipur.

He was very kind and I didn‚Äôt think he was trying to get anything out of me. After about 10-15min of talking he gives me his WhatsApp‚Äôs and invites me over for dinner with his friends. I thought it was kind and told him maybe tomorrow, as I wasn‚Äôt really in the mood and was unsure traveling on my first day in India alone. he later on sent a lot of messages asking where I was. Today on my walk another man approaches me and starts giving lots of advice about local travel, things to see, how to get around, etc. I was very grateful for this. He also then ask me to grab coffee with his friend in one hour so we could go and see an ‚Äúartist street‚Äù and grab street food. My question is: is this normal? Is there something I should watch out for? I‚Äôd love to take them up on their hospitality, but I‚Äôm just a little unsure traveling alone. Thanks  ",1,1761813249.0,india_tourism,11,1.0,False
