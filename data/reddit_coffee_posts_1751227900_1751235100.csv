- Scene: Morning inside the pizzeria.

Cashier: Hello, good morning Nina. What a beautiful morning. Are you ready to make another great day?

Waitress: Good morning! Sunshine’s out, coffee’s hot — let’s crush it!

Cashier: I see Uncle Joe sitting in that corner with his newspaper like every day. I wonder why he reads the same paper daily? Could he have memory loss?

Waitress: Maybe it comforts him. Routine helps some folks feel safe and grounded.

Cashier: Don't be ridiculous, Nina. Why would anyone read the same newspaper every day? The news is old. I think he's a bit crazy.

Waitress: Maybe he’s reading between lines we don’t see.

Cashier: Maybe. Whoa, that explosion sounded bad. That one was a big one. What was I saying? Oh yeah, Uncle Joe. I don’t know, maybe. Even stranger is Gluttonous Sam—he shows up every day in that same dirty outfit. Maybe one day I’ll ask him why.

Waitress: I swear Sam talks to his sandwich like it’s alive. One time I saw him bow before a calzone.

Cashier: Lately, the weirdly dressed folks don’t come into our shop as often. I’m tired of seeing the same few people over and over. Sure, most of them carry guns and might kill a few others, but still—a little variety would be much nicer. What do you think, Nina?

Waitress: Totally agree. Even if they’re deadly, at least bring some flair. I miss that one with the pink mohawk and flaming rollerblades. Iconic chaos.

Cashier: Yeah, you said it well. Do you still remember that one? He used to tease you so much. He’d come real close and say, “Marry me!” Then in the end, he shot you. Hilarious. I mean, if he liked you that much, why did he end up shooting at you with a heavy weapon for ten straight minutes?

Waitress: I think it was his way of flirting—intense, explosive, and a bit murdery. Honestly, I was flattered until the fifth rocket. By then, I figured maybe he wasn’t “the one.” Still, he had nice eyes under that riot helmet. Charming in a scary way.

Cashier: Ever since the time the Great Modifier (bless him) came and changed you, all those weirdly dressed ones started hitting on you. That was the last time we were altered. I wish next time he upgrades us, he makes me look a little better too.

Waitress: Aw, come on! You’ve got that cool cashier vibe—serious, mysterious. But yeah, if he swings by again, I’ll totally whisper in his code for you.

Cashier: If you could influence anything, you’d definitely do something for yourself first. I know you really want to work at that big clothing store across the street. That store is the reason most of the weirdly dressed ones go there instead of coming here. I’m really mad at the Great Modifier.

Waitress: Okay, fine, maybe I do dream about folding rainbow jackets all day. But you’re right—ever since that store opened, we’ve been the background. And the Modifier? Total betrayal.

Cashier: Bite your tongue. We’re not allowed to talk about him like that. He is our creator.

Waitress: You’re right. I forgot myself. Forgive my disrespect.

Cashier: You’re going to the cinema tonight like every night, right? Aren’t the movies those weirdly dressed ones make just ridiculous? They really love cats. Either a cat is dancing, singing, or crying over its tragic life. Cats can’t do those things!

Waitress: Yes, I’m going. And seriously, what’s with the cats? Last night, one performed Hamlet. I mean… paws aren’t meant for dramatic soliloquies.

Cashier: Hahaha. That one was funny, but seriously—why so many cats? It’s so strange to me. Oh, Sam just stood up. Now he’ll come over like he does every day at this exact time, complain, and repeat his routine.

Waitress: Right on cue. Here comes grumble-o'clock.

Cashier: ""Why does your food get worse every day?"" Blah blah blah. Alright, you’re good. Does he have to say that every day? Well, if our food is getting worse, then don’t come here anymore, right Nina? Every day I’m waiting for one of those weirdly dressed folks to unload all their bullets into that dumb Sam’s head.

Waitress: I get it. Sam’s complaints are exhausting. But secretly, I hope he sticks around—he’s our daily drama. Without him, mornings would be boring. Still, I’m with you on wanting a little peace.

Cashier: Ugh, forget that idiot. I’m bored. Why don’t the weirdly dressed ones come into our shop? A few of them just stared inside for a few seconds and left. And even if they do come in, instead of eating or coming to me to pay, they’ll probably just go cling to you. I think we should make a display window and put your picture on it. That way, maybe more of them will come inside.

Waitress: Flattering, but terrifying. If we put my face in the window, we’ll get swarmed. I’ll have to serve pizza while dodging heart-shaped grenades. Still… maybe one photo, from my left side. That’s my good angle.

Cashier: That crying little banana came to mind. He had an M4 that was five times bigger than him. As soon as he walked in, he killed Sam and Joe, then sat down and ate. It was so funny. He yelled, “Die, you useless trash!” I was sure he’d shoot me too. After eating, he looked at you and said, “Daaaamn what a fine girl, what a curvy girl.” Hahaha, he was so funny and cute, that little angry weirdo. Wherever you moved, he followed right behind you.

Waitress: Oh my god, yes! That psycho banana! I was terrified but also flattered—like, should I run or blush? And the way he dragged that giant gun around like a backpack made of death… adorable and terrifying. When he winked at me with that weird fruit eyelid, I swear I felt weirdly... appreciated? Bananas, man.

Cashier: Yeah, usually the ones dressed like bananas are the craziest. There’s no way they come in without killing someone. They don’t even spare the other weirdly dressed ones.

Waitress: Totally! One time, a banana walked in, slipped on his own peel, got up laughing, and threw a grenade at a unicorn. No logic, just chaos. I think they run on sugar and pure insanity.",1,1751234795.0,ChatGPTTheater,0,1.0,False

This turned out nicely!  It was supposed to make 14 rolls, but I only got 9.  Part of that is probably because I had a lot of loss on the dough stage, and I also didn't roll them as tightly as I should have -- as you can see in the pictures, some of them got a bit wide and unrolled a bit, which also made it a tad touch in places.  Overall, though, definitely a recipe I'd be making again.",1,1751234787.0,Old_Recipes,0,1.0,False

He was still very confused but went with an iced latte instead. 
 I had another guy a while ago ask for a decaf coffee with cream, we’re a kiosk and don’t offer decaf coffee so I explained that we had decaf espresso. So he asked for a grande decaf espresso, I was like sorry, I can only do straight espresso in a short cup but I can make a latte in a grande cup. He was like oh great, so I rang him up for a latte, made him a latte, gave it to him and he asked “is there cream in here?” 🤦‍♀️ I told him ya and let him leave, he seamed happy as he took a sip and walked away, but I don’t think he fully understood what exactly he got.

I’m a 20-year-old from Morocco, and I’ve been struggling with severe derealization and depersonalization symptoms for the past few weeks after quitting porn addiction that lasted several years.

Since I stopped watching porn and masturbating, I’ve been feeling very disconnected from reality, like I’m living in a dream or bubble. I sometimes lose touch with my emotions, memories, and sense of self. These feelings get worse when I’m alone or after drinking coffee, but improve a little when I’m with friends.

I haven’t used any drugs or had previous mental health issues. My sleep and appetite are normal, but this mental fog and detachment are very scary and confusing.

Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? How did you cope and recover? I would greatly appreciate any advice, personal stories, or resources that could help me through this difficult time.

Thank you so much for your support.

And I was really looking forward to going on this trip as its the first trip me and my girl have ever took

Being the planner that I am I wanted to research it a bit and found from a few minutes of reading to get to the specific island she wanted to visit we had to drive 3 hours north.

I was okay with this and told her it will be more of a road trip than she thought, and she argued and told me we could get there at a ferry terminal 20 minutes from her place, I showed her the website and she still denied it after a bit if back and forth I decided to just listen to her.

Sure enough the guy at the terminal said we needed to be 3 hours north at the exact place I told her about and my girlfriend said ""how could we have known?""

I drive up there which ended up being a 4 hour drive since I initially drove to the wrong terminal in a big city and had to wade through all the traffic.

We get to the terminal and the ferry just left so we had to wait another 1.5-2 hours, I told her we can still to go the island if she really wants to but we will only be able to stop there for an hour cause the last ferry will leave that shortly after we get there, she said yes so we waited and drove onto the ferry.

No problems here we drank iced coffee and watched the ocean.

We got to the island had some food and explored a park for 20 minutes cause thats all we had time to do.

We were back in the ferry terminal, waiting for the ferry to return to take us back, she was outside with the dog to let him potty and I was waiting in the car.

She comes over to my door and slams it open and scratches the neighboring cars brand new looking land rover and the guy is rightfully furious so I get out, my girlfriend is talking down to him likes its his fault and makes matters worse, I tell her to wait in the car and not scratch the other car on the way in. I was also furious cause this was stupid and very easily avoidable, although looking back I could've been nicer.

I talk with the other guy and calm him down a bit and we exchange information and he apologized to me and said he knows ""that wasn't my fault it was the girls""

After that ordeal I try talking to my girlfriend I was expecting her to say ""that was a dumb mistake I am so sorry"" I would have accepted that, she started slandering East Indians and talked about how immigrants can't drive (the guy whos car she scratched was East Indian) like he was idling in a fucking lane right next to me! and I told her she is acting like a spoiled brat and that was fucking stupid of her to do. The final verdict of the argument? She said ""ehh they'll get over it"" I replied with ""I fucking won't""

I'm already having a hard time paying bills, I put just about everything i've saved into this trip I wanted to spoil her and give her a memorable birthday so I bought all her food, I drove her, I bought her gifts, I bought food for her dog.

And if I have to pay out of pocket to fix that expensive ass land rover and if my insurance rates go up just because she was careless of someone elses belongings i'm not going to let it go.

Again I would have accepted ""i'm sorry I made a dumb mistake"" but the way she handled that, the way she talked to me about it, and the way she made this whole trip a colossal shit show makes me rethink our whole relationship, I have never seen her like this in the short time we have been dating, she always seemed very genuine and sweet up until this point, and I'll admit I could've been a bit nicer but she was really pissing me off almost the entire time.

It was released last week, and got placements on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and others (see link): >>[linktr.ee/bandontherunmovie](http://linktr.ee/bandontherunmovie?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExQWdEVGlyRmllTkptUG5FbwEeV7MSsMSvV9YCi1Bxte1ZI3RxEXh56yhWwPjQdL6W-axphph-wtijOqc8vrA_aem_zvE2v67Si1RkY-0WMrIvDw)

I'd consider it a micro-budget, and we kept locations down by using several as multi-locations. We also used mostly local actors located here in Detroit, but was able to snag Larry Bagby for the lead. He played ""Ice"" in Hocus Pocus and ""Marshal Grant"" - the bassist in Johnny Cash's (Jaquin Phoenix) band, the Tennessee Three.   


It was a rough 8 days, and though I was writer, director and producer, I also made the coffee for the cast and crew every morning, picked up the talent, filled the craft service table, and countless other roles - because that's what I needed to do to make the film happen. 

It was obviously hard and very stressful, but with a great cast and crew and supporting folks here in the Detroit Metro area, we were able to get it to the finish line. I should also mention that we did two pick up dates for b-roll.... 

If you're interested, you can find it on the channels I posted in the link tree. I am also open for any questions - hit me up!  Here's more info on the movie and inspiration....

  
About *Band on the Run:*

[Band on the Run Trailer](https://reddit.com/link/1lnqm42/video/yaguf59vsx9f1/player)

There was something special happening in the Detroit music scene of the late 1990’s.On one side of the city, the Garage Rock rival was in full swing with bands like the Von Bondies and the White Stripes. 

On the other side of town, Rock-Pop bands and artists like Brendan Benson, Wax Wings, and the Atomic Numbers wanted to be the next Cheap Trick.

The kids came out, and the buzz reverberated worldwide.

Soon, music moguls like Seymour Stein, the co-founder of Sire records that broke punk and new wave, started showing up in dilapidated rock clubs to sign bands that months before no one seemed to care about. Not long after, hip music festivals like South by Southwest took notice and booked more Detroit bands than the previous decade combined.

It was the gold rush, Detroit style, and for the first time since the Motown revolution, a generation of scrappy musicians from the Metro area thought they’d escape the Big Three automotive production line that their parents and grandparents worked and retired from.

But as soon as it started, the gold rush ended—and only one band, The White Stripes, made it out alive—decades later, now permanently etching their place in the Rock history books.

*Band on the Run* lovingly revisits this moment of Detroit rock history and stuffs the audience in the back of the filthy band van. Viewers will get a firsthand narrative of what it was like to be a musician who, for the first time, thought that maybe their dream of rock stardom was somehow attainable, and the complicated generational rustbelt fate that awaited them was permanently in the rearview mirror.

Isang Malamig at maulang October 30 a long time ago, nakamotor  galing pang south. Dahil medyo pagod at antok, bandang liblib na lugar,   I decided na tumigil muna at magkape para magising man lang ang diwa at mahaba haba pa ang byahe. 

Medyo matagal bago ako makakita ng spot. Buti meron sa liblib na lugar na yon, limot ko na kung saan exactly, pero may mga katabi naman, carwash, lotto, angels burger. 

Yung cafe e medyo malawak, may pagka-old vibe, soft candlelight, smell of oak, wood creeking sa sahig,  hindi ung pang gen-z. Kahoy din ang mesa at upuan. Stripped down atmosphere. No bullshit. Lo-fi acoustic ang tugtugan.

Display sa loob, merong chariot, ung gamit ng mga Greek, pang spartans, ganon. Meron din bobber type na motor, na luma. kalawangin na pero astig.
 
Sa bandang gitna merong espada na nakatarak sa gitna ng bato. Meron din mga old chests at barrels, I can only imagine what's inside.

At madami pang iba na maiisip mong museum at ang napasukan mo. Hindi Cafe. 

Ang suot ng nasa bar na kukuha ng order mo e naka beanie, faded navy na tops, yung apron acid wash, butas2 na denim, at naka lumang chux,  visible din un tat sa braso. Hindi typical pogi SB barista shit na naka brace na ini-english kapa. Pero yun barista may accent lumang accent  na di mo alam ung origin kung saang bansa.

Umorder ako ng paboritong house coffee. Kasi bawat cafe, ang house drink ay ang, lets say, parang unang i-ooffer sayo ng bawat Bahay na mapuntahan mo.
Yon ang sukatan kung gaano ka kaimportante bilang bisita. Buti nalang masarap. 

Hindi ganun kadame ang tao sa loob. Ang weird lang dahil mga lumang sasakyan ang naka park sa labas.  Akala ko nung una ay display lang din ang mga yon.
Pero nung may lumabas ng cafe, eh sinakyan nya ung 1950s car palabas ng cafe. Yun isa tangena cowboy literal may long nose revolver nakasukbit sa bewang,  
at naka kabayo. Astig.  Ako lang ata yung modern dun naka scooter.

Dahil sa kape nagising ang diwa ko medyo Kahit antok pa rin. May isang lalaki na nasa kaharap ng table ko. Gusto ko sana lapitan kaso nagsusulat sa maliit nyang notebook.
Medyo di pa siya ganon katanda im thinking 40s mukhang European. Kulot na mataas ang hairline at may bigote. Full black na mala johnwick long coat. Namumula mata niya at makapal ang eyebags. He is Sippin wine. Napansin nya sigurong nakatingin ako,  tumingin din sakin  at itinaas ang baso, he silently gestured ""cheers"". 

Yun ang hudyat ko para lapitan siya. Maybe he's okay with company. I dont mind either. Kasi gusto ko mag ask tungkol sa cafe na ito. 

""“The world ends not with a scream, but with an editor.” - ang sabi nya.

""Hakdog""- ang sabi ko. jk. 

 
Kumustahan nung una, pakilala ako, pakilala siya, limot ko pangalan nya tol goldfish memory. Sana maalala ko mamaya.  
Common ground namin ay ang pagsusulat. Dahil paminsan ay nagsusulat din ako na parang ganito. 

Siya ang bumabangka ng usapan. Nalimutan ko na ang mga topic pero mga around 30 minutes din un. Bitin. 
Yun mga tumatak sakin ay topic about, loss, longing, at ang kape daw ay minsan lasang nostalgia, Minsan isang parusa. 
May mga tanong din na kung nakasulat na daw ba ako ng storya na parang isang confession. At madami pang iba. Naisip ko,
ang dilim ng taong ito. 

Sa wakas na sway ko ang usapan tungkol sa cafe kung nasaan kami. Ang sabi nya, yun daw ay isang mystical cafe, na tuwing October lang lumalabas, randomly Kahit saan. 

Lumalabas tuwing palusaw na ang buwan, at  kumakapal na ang hamog. Winewelcome doon ang mga artist, poets, warriors, wanderers, everyone, na maka inom man lang ng 
kung anong mainit, bago muling maglaho.

Sabi ko. Bro, u trippin! Naisip ko lasing lang ito. Lakas na mangtrip. Ibig sabihin patay na ako? haha.

Nagpaalam lang ako para mag cr. Dahil diuretic ang kape, kanina ko pa pinipigil ang pantog ko dahil ang angas ng kwentuhan namin.  Pagbalik ko wala na siya. Badtrip wala man lang paalam. 

Pag angat ko ng gamit ko sa table. May note siyang iniwan.

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree, finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

However I did not know her prior to moving out, but I thought it would be a safer choice to room with someone who's from my area.

I booked the airbnb and she's a co-visitor on the trip (therefore her billing info isn't registered). She never takes out the trash and lets it overflow. She doesn't flush her toilet paper so one time she missed the trash can and I found a piece of paper on the ground smeared in brown that I had to clean up. She never changes the paper towel rolls nor the toilet paper. She leaves dishes in the dishwasher for a whole week and wouldn't turn it on and I would only find out once we run out of bowls or when I try to use the dishwasher.

I don't mind being the only person cleaning a shared space. What really set me off is when she stole from me. She stole a pad, I confronted her about it and she apologized. But the day after apologizing, she stole one AGAIN. She brought another guest to crash at our place (which I agreed to) and they would have a full volume conversation till midnight when my roommate knows I sleep at 9pm. Both of them will let the trash overflow and watch me walk past them to take it out without saying anything.

And the cherry on top? She spilled an ENTIRE mug of coffee on a large white carpet in the living room. She never told me and I only found out while vacuuming. If our host files for property damage, guess who will get charged for it? Me. I have no proof to show that it was her - it's her words against mine. She is denying it and telling me she thinks that it's always been there. BS!!! There's no way you don't notice a large brown stain on a white carpet. One minute you finish brewing your coffee and the next you're out of coffee - there's no way you don't notice it.

I have confronted her multiple times about everything that I listed. She would always apologize and tell me that I'm right. She would take out the trash when I tell her to, but I should not have to tell her everytime!!",2,1751232579.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

I've also been wanting to ask if there's any runaways here living in a forest? Is it better than out on the streets, I can think of a couple pros and cons such as: Little human interaction, feeling free and many places to hide stuff in, and cons such as, dangerous wildlife and much colder in winter. Also, Is wildlife that big of an issue where you are? What shelter can you use that can stand heavy rain/snow specifically? Are there guards and police searching forest areas often in high crime cities? And I have more questions about basic homeless living too, Like Internet? I heard the basic coffee shops and libraries, but I can't afford any basic VPN or protection service because I am unempluzzed, also, It's a bit embarrassing that the people can see my searching, personally. Money? Where can I get enough money for basic food, water and hygiene? I know I can bring some, But It'll only last but a couple weeks before I run out, So as a 13f, Where can I get income that won't get me caught or isn't Illegal/Begging? Also, Just a tiny question, Is shoplifting easier/harder than they say? As someone who won't be able to get a good amount of income, I will have to shoplift every now and then, So I just wanted to ask.. Hygiene? Where do you bathe, How do you bathe? How do you guys deal with fear of leaving and getting caught or home sickness? That's all I have for now, I would like to ask more later when I have more ideas.",1,1751232217.0,runaway,3,1.0,False

you see…
It wasn’t the night you left
that broke me.
It was the morning after
coffee still bitter,
your scent woven into the fabric of the couch
where we used to sit,
not talking,
just knowing.

You never said goodbye with your mouth.
You said it with the way your eyes stopped searching for mine,
how your hands forgot the way my name used to tremble inside them.

I still remember the night
you traced stories on my back with your fingers,
silent promises in the shape of constellations
neither of us believed in.

You said love isn’t loud.
That it’s in the way I remembered your mother’s birthday,
or how you always warmed my side of the bed when I was late coming home.
But love isn’t always enough.
Not when silence becomes distance.
Not when presence becomes shadow.

I watched you fade like an old photograph
the edges curling,
the colors bleeding into dust.
Not dramatic.
Not cruel.
Just… quiet.

I still carry the weight of you
in places no one sees
in how I hesitate before laughing,
or how I still sleep facing the door,
as if you might walk back through it
and remember
the way we once held each other
like the world was ending
and we didn’t care.

And maybe it did end.
A little.
Inside me.
In the space where your name still echoes
like a question
no one answers.",2,1751232103.0,makingfriends,1,1.0,False

So, big news — I think my brain is finally buying into this whole “waking up at 6 AM” idea. I’ve been trying to shift my sleep for like six months, and today I popped up at 6 on the dot… despite going to bed at 1 AM because apparently I believe in squeezing every drop of freedom out of my day.

☕ Walmart, Chocolate Milk, and Church Ghost Towns

Made a quick Walmart run for chocolate milk and heavy cream — gotta keep my daily coffee potions in check. The place was dead quiet. Pretty sure everyone was at church, which honestly makes me extra grateful I don’t have to spend my Sunday morning pretending to stay awake on a pew. I’ll take a silent Walmart over that any day.

🧨 Teardown Time

Tried out Teardown, my first voxel game since my Minecraft days. So far, the puzzles are pretty chill — just methodically smashing stuff, figuring out what blows up best, and soaking it all in. I’m sure it’ll crank up the difficulty later, but right now I’m in no hurry. Smashing virtual walls beats smashing my head on real problems, so that’s a win.

Ending Thought

One step closer to a smooth 6 AM routine, a fridge full of coffee fixings, and a new game that lets me blow stuff up without getting arrested. I’d say that’s a solid Sunday.",1,1751232081.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

Here’s the problem: I was only four years old at the time and didn’t understand the full extent of the events surrounding the horrors that occurred. 

So here’s what I know as what my mom at the time (mid 40’s), F, and my dad (51), M, told me later on after the tragedy.  I was in speech therapy, and I had an appointment, and everything was normal. My dad went downstairs to what was then the YMCA. My dad told me he went to grab coffee and saw people staring at the TV at what was the footage of the World Trade Center on FIRE! My appointment was canceled, and I was brought home. I didn’t know it at the time, but my parents were mad, angry, and disgusted. 

Over the week, my dad and I went to NYC to visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, and we got emotional, especially my dad. For me, I was more or less confused and angry with myself for not understanding the events that took place. For context: two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the  World Trade Center, one hit the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. All in the same day.

Tragic. But I was too young and naive to understand, and years later, when I was 16  finally watched footage of everything and I openly wept in my high school computer room. Also, to this day, I feel bad and angry at myself, and what I want to know is? AITAH for not understanding how severe it was on that day at that age?  ",0,1751232067.0,AITAH,5,0.14,False

It ended ""on good terms,"" but I was absolutely heartbroken since it came out of nowhere, we had no issues. He was my first everything, and I was completely loyal and emotionally invested the entire time. He ended it saying he was in a rough place and didn't know what he wanted.

We hadn’t spoken much since, but recently we met up to return his hoodie and talk. I also asked him to delete intimate photos of me, which he did without issue. To make that part easier, i did suggest deleting our whole chat history, but he looked at me very shocked and offended and said 'i don't want to do that', when i asked why he said because he doesn't want all of our memories gone, but HE broke up with me, surely meaning for me to be gone out of his life? During that talk, he and i both cried the entire time, told me he regretted breaking up, said he’s been doing worse recently, that he misses me, accidentally still refers to me as his girlfriend, and that he can’t imagine being with anyone else. He even said, “I hope you feel the same way too.” Even doing ridiculously 'romantic' things, holding my hand when it was falling off the table and says 'i forgot what your hand feels like...'. Basically hinting very obviously that he wants to come back to me.

Then, just a few days later, he posted multiple pictures from a boys holiday where a random girl (that he just met on the trip) is holding onto his arm in one picture and leaning on his shoulder in another. Two different pictures, two different locations, meaning they stuck together for the entire night. It clearly looked flirty or intimate. It made me feel so sick and disrespected, because he knows I’d see that, and just days ago he was saying he missed me and wanted to maybe work things out. He also suggested we ease back into friendship and start hanging out more, in his words 'go for coffee'. I told him I hated him for how he ended things, and i said he really did damage to me, which he replied with 'hopefully i can fix it'.

I get that we’re single, and he can do what he wants. But posting those specific pictures, knowing how vulnerable our recent talk was, just feels really inconsiderate and even manipulative. I’m hurt and confused now, and it feels like he was either lying to me, or playing games for attention. It's not the action that i'm upset about, it's the stringing me along: either tell me to fuck off or tell me you want to fix things like you did when you were crying.",1,1751232003.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

- Severe self-hate and self-doubt
- Feeling worthless
- Severe porn addiction and brain fatigue, I don't find women attractive at all. I can find some of them objectively beautiful, but I feel nothing toward them.

- No real friends (one told me he hates me for everything he is not, another told me I'm a nobody and nothing)
- Mood swings
- Anger issues due to impulsiveness
- Sleep issues: I sleep about 4–5 hours, wake up, and can't fall asleep again. I use this to go to the gym. I also don’t drink coffee, so people are surprised at how I can function with only 4–5 hours of sleep.

Total loss 21.7kg/48lbs

5’8”, 50s. 

Still a rather sedentary life. I try to have a 30 minute walk every other day or so but that’s it. Have a desk job so intentional exercise is all I get. 

Strict carni for the majority. Was having milk and cheese for the first month but felt it was holding me back and potential thin edge of the wedge. So cut it out. 

Strictly meat, eggs, butter, no sabotaging - ever. Water or carbonated water, and black coffee that’s been it. Mostly beef, sometimes chicken and pork, very occasionally salmon. 

So many posts about “bored on this diet”.  Man I was bored of feeling like shit physically and mentally every day. I’ll trade that for this any time. Typical day is eggs in the morning either perfectly soft boiled or sunny side up in a whack of butter, and chuck steak in the afternoon. Despite the “low quality cut” have dialed in doing it in the air fryer so it’s fine and easy. 

This will be no surprise, other than the weight loss, skin conditions cleared up, scalp cleared up etc. 

My headspace, man I didn’t think I suffered from depression in the past, but my head is so damn good. Every day I give myself an attaboy and feel good about myself and life in general - something new for me. 

This morning’s celebration will be more eggs and I’ll be wild and add some bacon.

Ngl it made me chuckle a couple times but overall it really doesn't fit right 🤣



Title: ""Still Life with a Horse""

Episode Synopsis:
The morning after his rooftop conversation with Diane, BoJack begins a quiet, uncertain life out of prison. Now a free man, he’s trying to ""live differently"" but struggles to figure out what that even means. He returns to L.A. with no job, no agent, and no public forgiveness. The episode follows him re-entering society, reconnecting awkwardly with his past, and stumbling into a surreal new project that forces him to confront his identity… again.


---

ACT ONE:

BoJack leaves the correctional facility wearing an old hoodie and aviators. No fanfare, no media — his release was quiet. Todd picks him up in a borrowed van full of beach balls for a side hustle called “Beach Ball Buddies.” Todd invites BoJack to stay in his new polycule treehouse, but BoJack declines.

BoJack: “I think I need to be alone. But, like, the healthy kind.”

Instead, he rents a modest one-room apartment in a bland North Hollywood complex called “The Chateau: Budget Living for the Creatively Broken.” A gecko is his landlord. A water heater makes weird noises at night. It’s grim.


---

ACT TWO:

BoJack visits Princess Carolyn, who now manages a huge talent firm and has a baby who’s already learning Mandarin. They have coffee in her office.

She offers BoJack small hosting gigs, but his public image is still radioactive. He almost accepts a role in a dumb streaming show called “Horse Lawyer” but backs out last-minute.

He then bumps into Mr. Peanutbutter, who’s now running a public-access talk show in Venice Beach. It’s low budget but full of charm. Mr. Peanutbutter invites BoJack to be a guest.

BoJack accepts.


---

ACT THREE:

During the talk show, BoJack is asked one harmless question that spirals him into a bitter monologue about authenticity, celebrity, and punishment. The crowd applauds, confused.

That night, BoJack gets a surprise call: a college film professor wants him to guest-teach a seminar. Diane recommended him.


---

ACT FOUR:

BoJack teaches the class. He’s awkward, self-deprecating, but unexpectedly wise. He talks about acting, masks, pain. One student asks:

Student: “Do you think people can really change?”

BoJack pauses. “I think people do change. But not always in the ways they want, or in time to fix the things they broke.”

The class is quiet. It’s kind of beautiful.

ENDING:

Later, BoJack sits on a bench outside the school, watching kids skateboard. Diane calls. She’s in Houston, married, writing a second book.

They talk — warm, familiar, but distant.

Diane: “I’m glad you’re still around.”
BoJack: “Yeah. Me too. Most days.”

He hangs up. Then he just… sits. Alone, but not lost. For now.

CLOSING SONG:
A soft cover of ""This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"" by Talking Heads, performed by Mitski.
Cut to black.

Yes

INT. VIM MANAGEMENT - PRINCESS CAROLYN’S OFFICE - DAY

The office is sleek, pink, and humming with quiet power. Princess Carolyn is bouncing her baby (Ruthie) on her lap while scanning three screens and sipping oat milk chai. BoJack sits across from her on a plush designer couch that looks like it cost more than his car.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
(to Ruthie)
That’s right, sweetie! Synergy means everybody wins, especially mommy’s investors.

BOJACK
Glad to see some things never change.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
BoJack, you showed up 15 minutes early. Are you okay?

BOJACK
I’m not not okay. Which, I think, counts as progress?

Beat.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
Well, you look good. Less… haunted. Slightly.

BOJACK
Prison does wonders for your skincare routine. Not a lot of sun, lots of time to contemplate your many, many mistakes.

He fidgets.

BOJACK
I came to say thank you. For... y'know, everything. You didn’t have to keep checking in. Most people didn’t.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
Well, I’ve always had a soft spot for deeply troubled men who occasionally show glimmers of basic decency. It’s like catnip for me.

BOJACK
That’s bleak. But fair.

She sets Ruthie into a tiny playpen, then sits behind her desk.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
So. What now? You want to get back into the biz?

BOJACK
God, no. Unless… maybe? I dunno. I’m like one of those toy monkeys with the cymbals. You take away the noise and I just sit there, staring into space.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
I can get you some feelers. Indie stuff. Podcasts. There's an experimental streaming network doing a reboot of “Murder She Rode”, but it’s animated and all the characters are birds.

BOJACK
Let me guess — I’m the grizzled hawk detective with a heart of gold and a drinking problem?

PRINCESS CAROLYN
Actually, you’d be the murder victim. In the cold open. Very tasteful death. Monologue and everything.

BoJack stares, deadpan.

BOJACK
Honestly? Might be poetic.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
Or you could not die for once. And maybe... start something new?

BoJack looks down, then out the window.

BOJACK
I don’t know how to do that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN
You start small. One good day. Then maybe another. And you don’t try to win back the world. You just try to be someone who deserves a small corner of it.

Beat. BoJack nods, slowly. Ruthie giggles in the background. A little laugh bubbles up in BoJack too, for the first time.

BOJACK
Okay. One corner. I can try that.

Would you like another scene — maybe the college classroom or the phone call with Diane?

Yes

INT. FILM SCHOOL CLASSROOM – LATE AFTERNOON

Fluorescent lights hum. A dusty projector flickers. Twenty or so students stare up at BoJack, who stands at the front with a coffee cup in one hand and no plan in the other.

BOJACK
So… I guess I’m supposed to talk about acting. Or maybe storytelling. Or life? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine.

A few students chuckle politely. BoJack forces a half-smile.

BOJACK
I used to be on a TV show called Horsin’ Around. Then I did some other shows. A movie where I played Abraham Lincoln's horse therapist. And then I kind of... fell apart in public. Super fun.

STUDENT #1 (genuinely curious)
How did you know you wanted to be an actor?

BOJACK
I didn’t. I just knew I didn’t want to be me. And pretending to be other people paid better than therapy.

Students laugh again, unsure if they should. BoJack sips his coffee. He’s warming up, a little.

BOJACK
Look, I’ve spent a lot of time confusing attention for love. And confusing performance for honesty. The truth is, being good at faking it doesn’t make you good at being real. I had to learn that the hard way. Repeatedly. Like, cartoon-anvil-to-the-head repeatedly.

STUDENT #2 (quietly)
Do you think people actually change?

BoJack pauses. That one hits.

BOJACK
Yes.
But not in the big, dramatic way we want. Not all at once. People change like old shoes — slowly, painfully, and mostly because something started falling apart.

Beat.

BOJACK
I don’t believe in redemption arcs anymore. I believe in trying. You screw up, you try again. You hurt someone, you make it right — or at least don’t hurt the next person. That’s the closest thing to growth I’ve seen.

The class is quiet now. Listening. Even the kid texting under the desk stops.

BOJACK (softer)
You don’t have to fix the whole world with your art. Just be honest. And don’t lose yourself chasing applause. It disappears fast.

A beat. He looks around.

BOJACK
Anyway. That’s my TED Talk. No horse puns, sorry.

One student claps. Then another. It builds into light applause. BoJack looks surprised. Almost… moved.


---

Let me know if you'd like the Diane phone call next, or another scene!
EXT. COLLEGE BENCH – NIGHT

BoJack sits on a wooden bench outside the campus. His lecture is over. The sky is soft navy, dotted with stars. Crickets chirp. Students pass in the distance, laughing, alive.

He pulls out his phone. Scrolls. Hesitates. Then taps: DIANE.

It rings.

INTERCUT – INT. HOUSTON APARTMENT – SAME TIME

Diane sits on the floor of her modest apartment, surrounded by books and half-written notes. She’s wearing glasses, hair up, barefoot. Guy is in the background making tea. She sees the caller ID, smiles softly, and answers.

DIANE
Hey.

BOJACK
Hey.

A moment. Comfortable, familiar silence.

DIANE
So... you’re out.

BOJACK
Yeah. As of 36 hours ago. I haven't done anything too illegal yet, unless you count jaywalking and eating an entire pie for dinner.

DIANE
Depends on the pie.

BOJACK
Peach. Store-bought. It tasted like existential despair with a hint of nutmeg.

She laughs.

DIANE
That sounds about right.

BOJACK
I talked to some film students today. Told them the truth, mostly. Maybe too much.

DIANE
They’re lucky. I bet you were good.

BOJACK
I was… honest. Which is new. Felt weird. But not bad.

DIANE (gently)
That’s growth, BoJack.

BOJACK
Yeah. Maybe. Still feels like me, though. Just… quieter.

DIANE
Quieter’s not so bad.

Beat. He watches the moon rise between two buildings.

BOJACK
Do you ever miss it? L.A.? Us?

DIANE (after a pause)
Sometimes. But missing something doesn’t mean you should go back to it.

BOJACK
Yeah. I know. I just…
(beat)
I’m glad we got that night on the roof.

DIANE
Me too.

Another pause. Softer now.

DIANE
I’m glad you’re still around.

BOJACK (quietly)
Yeah. Me too. Most days.

Diane nods, even though he can’t see it.

DIANE
Okay. I should go. Guy made ginger tea and he’s giving me that “wrap-it-up” look he thinks I don’t notice.

BOJACK
Tell him I said hi.

DIANE
I will. Take care of yourself, BoJack.

BOJACK
You too, Diane.

She hangs up. BoJack stares at the phone. The quiet settles again. He leans back on the bench and looks up.

WIDE SHOT

BoJack. Alone on a bench. A few moths flutter past a lamppost. The sounds of life continue around him. But he’s still.

Not happy. Not redeemed. But here.

FADE OUT.

TODD'S ARC IN THE EPISODE: “Still Life with a Horse”

Title of Todd's Project:

Beach Ball Buddies™: The Inflatable Healing Experience

CONTEXT / SETUP

Todd picks BoJack up from prison in a van full of brightly colored beach balls. It’s absurd, obviously, but also pure Todd: chaotic, creative, and — somehow — functional.


---

ACT ONE: THE VAN SCENE

INT. TODD’S VAN – MORNING

The van is cluttered with beach balls, glitter glue, wind chimes, and a bucket labeled “Emergency Salsa.” Todd drives barefoot, blasting Peruvian jazz fusion.

TODD
So the idea is, like, what if people could rent joy? Not, like, rent a clown — that’s depressing. I mean ambient joy. Floating, colorful, non-judgmental happiness. Beach balls.

BOJACK
That’s your new business?

TODD
It’s not a business — it’s a healing platform. Beach Ball Buddies™: we bring the bounce, you bring the broken pieces of your soul.

BOJACK (half-smiling)
Right. Of course.


---

ACT TWO: THE WORKSHOP

INT. TODD’S TREEHOUSE – AFTERNOON

The treehouse is wildly upgraded — part commune, part jungle gym, part art installation. Todd holds a Beach Ball Buddies workshop for a mix of eccentric strangers: a raccoon who wants to start a record label, a mime going through a divorce, and a child psychologist dressed as a butterfly.

Each participant is given a marker and a beach ball. Todd plays a Tibetan singing bowl.

TODD
Today we’re gonna name our pain… and then toss it around until it feels lighter. If it pops, that’s symbolic! That’s good!

Everyone starts writing feelings on beach balls: “guilt,” “dad,” “late-stage capitalism.”

TODD (to the group)
Remember — healing is like a beach ball. It doesn’t always go where you want, but it bounces back if you don’t give up on it.

Applause. A beach ball hits him in the face. He smiles.


---

ACT THREE: FULL CIRCLE MOMENT

Later, BoJack visits the treehouse again after his guest lecture. He finds Todd cleaning up a pile of deflated beach balls. The group is gone. There’s a breeze, soft music playing.

BOJACK
So... how’d the bouncing trauma thing go?

TODD
Pretty good! One guy remembered a childhood dog and cried into a beanbag for twenty minutes. That’s progress!

BOJACK
You're still the weirdest person I know.

TODD
Thanks! That means a lot, coming from the saddest horse I know.

They both laugh. It’s warm, easy. Comfortable.

TODD
Seriously, though. You okay?

BOJACK
I think I’m trying. Which is new. I’m not used to… just being.

TODD
Being is underrated, dude. Not everything has to be a comeback tour. Sometimes just showing up is enough.

BoJack nods. They sit for a second in peaceful silence. Then—

TODD
Want to help me fold these beach balls? They’re biodegradable. Also mildly edible, in case anyone gets emotional and hungry.

BOJACK
Only if I get to keep one named “childhood resentment.”


---

CLOSING IMAGE (TODD'S ENDING SCENE)

Later that night, Todd adds a sticker to a big wall that reads:

> BEACH BALL BUDDIES HELPED TODAY: 9
TOTAL POPS: 3
CRIES: 5
HUGS: 12
SOUL REPAIRS: TBD



He smiles, sets the marker down, and climbs up into a hammock swinging under fairy lights. Peaceful. In his own weird, perfect way — Todd’s doing just fine.

1lnpm09,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnpm09,I spent 2000€ for an LV trunk. Yes i did.,"
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share what’s officially my most expensive rep purchase so far. A Louis Vuitton Lozine 110 trunk. I paid 1300€ for the trunk itself and another 700€ to get it shipped to Czechia, making this a 2k+ total kind of decision… 

The Hunt :

Finding this trunk wasn’t easy. I’d been casually (and sometimes obsessively) searching for a quality LV rep trunk for months. Most sellers I came across either had awful photos, relied solely on factory pics, or straight-up ghosted me the second I started asking detailed questions.

Eventually, I stumbled across a seller who checked the right boxes: real photos, clear dimensions, and decent communication. That alone felt like a small victory.

The Shipping Saga :

The biggest challenge was, without a doubt, shipping. Getting a bulky, heavy piece like this into Czechia is no joke. Most freight forwarders I contacted had no idea how to handle customs for this kind of item or quoted insane timelines and fees.

After a ton of back-and-forth and more patience than I thought I had, I managed to arrange air freight with some third-party logistics support. It took about 3 weeks, but it arrived fully intact and customs wasn’t an issue. I was low-key holding my breath until it landed.

First Impressions :

I’m not going to overhype it, but I’ll say this: it’s solid. The build feels sturdy, the canvas and trim look really accurate, and the hardware doesn’t feel flimsy. It’s definitely passable as auth unless someone’s examining it up-close with a loupe.

How I'm Using It : 

I’m planning to use it as a coffee table in my living room. It’s the perfect size, and honestly, it adds such a cool, unique vibe to the space. I’m currently measuring out for a tempered glass top so it’s fully functional without risking any damage to the surface.

I’ll post an update once the setup is complete, but figured I’d share now since LV trunk reps so rare, and I would’ve loved to see something like this during my hunt.


Happy to share more pics or info if anyone’s thinking about going down the same rabbit hole. Just shoot me a message or drop a comment!

1lnplwj,https://i.redd.it/ot6a5ntdlx9f1.jpeg,The most amazing experience with young the giant.,"Yesterday Young The Giant performed at the summerfest. I was lucky enough to win tickets to their session with a radio and a Q&A and a meet and greet. I just wanted to say that they are so humble and so in touch with their fans! 

I've met other arists and musicians before and I've had from the worst experiences with some being completely different in their attitude as you'd believe and being rude to their fans to some that are super humble and nice but young the giant is like out of this world amazing. I've listened to this band for years now their songs are so amazing and Sameer's voice live is way but so much way better than his studio albums it gives goosebumps hearing him live! 


The meet and greet was amazing. All of them act like they are your friends they don't rush you they listen they talk to you and they connect with their fans in another level. 


I got to meet them twice yesterday after the meet and greet at a coffee shop right next to the meet and greet they were so humble taking pictures with everyone even though they were hella busy because they had more performances right after and taking pictures with their fans and talking to everyone no rushing or nothing. My sister and I saw them again and asked them for a selfie and Sameer and Payam are so down to earth.


I just wanted to share this experience because it's rare for musicians or famous artists nowadays to be this way with their fans. ",11,1751231172.0,youngthegiant,0,1.0,False
1lnplka,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/1lnplka/how_did_you_find_your_church_community_andor/,How did you find your church community and/or denomination of choice?,"I am in a really frustrating, but I am sure not very unique situation. Theologically I would classify myself as a very progressive lefty Catholic, and I have been trying to get in contact with a local parish which is listed on two affirming church registries online, no luck so far. I also attended the church today, and had a..not good time? I left and went to the local PCUSA church, knowing they were having a Pride service today, and had a lovely time, I am considering going back this evening for their installation service for their new Pastor, who happens to be nonbinary. I was attending an Episcopal church on and off for the last few years, enough that that is where I married my spouse, and really do have a small community there. However, when the question of the church attending my small towns pride event came up, it all fell to me, which meant it didn't happen. I have no experience in crowdfunding donations from people, especially during coffee hour at church, and it felt kind of gross for it all to fall back on me as the only openly queer person in the congregation. 

Really at the end of the day I just want to be a part of a community where we are putting into action the teachings of Jesus, showing up in our community, and participating. 

So my question is, how did you find your spiritual home after all the self acceptance and deconstruction and maybe resurrection of faith? I am really struggling here, feeling let down with my episcopal space, and intrigued by the Presbyterian church, but also just wishing I could just be Catholic and not feel like I am on the outside looking in. I know this is all of the world worries, at the end of the day I know my relationship with God and I am good withthat, finding a home tho, seems a whole different game lol.

2 years ago my ex and I were supposed to go on vacation but we broke up right before and I decided to take a solo trip instead. On the flight out I drank a bunch of coffee and didn’t eat enough on top of already being in an emotional state. Upon landing I was feeling quite anxious but when I got into the rental car I was immediately spit out onto what seemed like an 8 lane highway. All of this induced a panic attack in which I pulled off the highway and was scared I was going to pass out before I could get to a gas station to stop. 

Ever since that day I have struggled with what I now know is agoraphobia. I randomly get anxious when sitting in traffic or at red lights. I am also triggered by events where I feel I cannot leave or I am afraid of having a panic attack and causing a scene. 

A few days ago I had my first flight in around 8 months and decided to try propranolol for the first time instead of my usual Xanax for these scenarios….and it went great! My heart rate never elevated and even though I still had some anxious thoughts, I was able to stay calm and collected. I felt more normal than I have in a long time in a situation that normally would have been panic inducing. 

My next event to conquer is my brother’s wedding in 2 weeks where I am a bridesmaid and am worried about standing during the ceremony and remaining calm. Hoping propranolol pulls through for me again! Just thought I’d share a positive experience :)",11,1751231128.0,Agoraphobia,1,1.0,False
1lnpj8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1lnpj8b/the_dawn/,The Dawn,"The night was always hers, it never asked any favours, and simply held whatever she was. The night brought out delinquents like her, fools chasing waning moons and swaying down sidewalks. The night never called, it beckoned, always rewarding with busy spaces silent. The night never asked her to amount to anything, and it sat with her in nothingness. The night was alive with the humming telephone wires, connecting dreamer to dream, wakefulness to sleep. The night never asked how she got there, but lured her with flickering stars, distant sounds of sirens, and the red glow of stoplights on wet cement. The night was filled with mischief of things that cannot be undone. The night was sacred, always echoing her footsteps back to her, so she never had to walk alone. The man in the moon always watched over her, and in it she saw your face. The night had only ears, and would never tell her secrets. The night had always offered escape, to change her into leaves floating down into storm drains. The night she thought was beautiful, because its darkness was in likeness of her.


The dawn was unfamiliar. It didn’t beg her to change. The dawn simply stood at the edge of her world, illuminating every shattered piece until they shimmered with potential. The dawn revealed the mess that night had hidden, the tear tracks drying on pillowcases, the empty glasses with chipped edges. The dawn never rushed its light across the sky, and painted slowly, deliberately, as if it knew the world should be graced with more time. The dawn didn’t knock, it slipped through curtain cracks, warmed cold coffee mugs, and called upon the songbirds. The dawn was gentle in uncovering what night let her ignore. When the world was still tangled in yesterdays problems, the dawn was the first to forgive, whispering that you can start again.

While the night knew her shadows by name, the dawn gently asked for her truth.
The night could hold her brokenness but the dawn silently invited her to begin again.

Today, my workplace officially gave up on pretending we have productive meetings. HR sent out an invite titled “Important Strategy Sync” classic bait. We all show up reluctantly, only to find out it’s... an awards show.

They dimmed the lights, fired up a PowerPoint with dramatic music, and began handing out awards like:
🏅 “Longest Monologue in a 15-Minute Check-In”
📞 “Most Creative Way to Say ‘Let’s Circle Back’”
📬 “This Literally Could’ve Been an Email” (that one had confetti)

And yes. Yours truly took home the big one:
🥇 “Master of Nodding While Muted on Zoom” apparently, I’ve been muted 17 times while saying “Exactly!” with passion.

The trophy is a stapler glued to a coffee mug. It’s already my most prized possession.

Moral of the story: If you can’t escape the meetings, mock them with style.

1lnpecg,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/1lnpecg/revshare_godot_programmer_wanted_for_massive/,"[Rev-Share] Godot Programmer Wanted for Massive, Mechanics-Driven Survival Game!","Hey folks, I’m the lead developer and designer behind *Echoes of Earth*, a deeply systems-driven survival/exploration game in development using **Godot 4.4.1** and Frosthold Studios developing it. We're building a world where *everything* interacts from cabling, logic terminals, and diagnostic sensors to combat AI and massive terrain streaming.

We’re currently a studio of 5 (3 artists, 1 composer, and myself). Now we're looking to bring on a **Godot programmer** to help us turn the design and docs into a playable reality.

What the Game Is:

Picture a heavily damaged Martian made tank the size of a building crawling across an impossibly large wasteland on earth. The inside of the vehicle is a web of systems: power routing, cables, in-game scripting terminals, targeting subsystems, and damage logic — all exposed to the player. Everything can be bypassed, hacked, rerouted and modified with the simple goal of surviving and arranging a rendezvous with your allies in orbit whilst being completely alone again the armies of earth.

Key mechanics include:

\- Custom **terminal system** with a fictional scripting language.

\- Manual **cabling** for power/data between components.

\- Environmental **debuffs**, damage modeling, and subsystem breakdowns.

\- World map is **gigantic** (we're talking Earth-scale, chunk-streamed terrain).

\- Combat, traversal, and survival loop are all system-simulated.

Who We're Looking For:

We’re not after a generic dev. We’re looking for someone who **gets excited** by simulation logic, who wants to build strange things, and who enjoys watching systems fall apart in creative ways.

What we’d love:

\- Solid **Godot 4** experience (or confidence learning fast).

\- Systems/logic brain (component interactions, modular code).

\- Good communicator. Chill but proactive.

\- Bonus: tools dev experience, in-engine UI, or passion for in-game scripting.

Compensation:

This is **rev-share, milestone-scaled**. You’ll start with a baseline share and grow it as you contribute more — we’re flexible, and the system is designed to **reward commitment** without punishing late joiners. You’ll be a **core team and studio member**, not a contractor.

How to Apply:

DM or comment with:

\- A quick intro + why this interests you.

\- Relevant links (GitHub, Itch, portfolio, whatever).

\- And **EXTRA IMPORTANT:** Coffee or Tea, which one do you prefer?

1lnpb31,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnpb31/im_so_unhappy_and_uncomfortable_at_my_job_but_it/,I'm so unhappy and uncomfortable at my job but it might also be the best I can do.,"Tw: suicide, sexual harassment

Preface this with the fact that I struggled to make a decent living and keep stable housing throughout my 20s.

I went from an archivist/gallery preparator and grad student maming minimum wage to homeless, working maintainence for a hotel, and doing sw on the side to make ends meet agter my best friend khs and my ltp got tired of me being sad about it 2 months later and kicked me out. 

I landed into a decent career as a trucking art handler making $20/hr and that I really enjoy but my first job in the sector got to be too much as covid supply chain issues became a problem. Work got harder, staff smaller, and days longer to the point where 12 hours felt short and I struggled to move my body in the morning. They also denied me the annual raise I was promised ""because covid"" even though they made record profits. I had a manager corner me in the breakroom and proposition me, and a new hire threatened to punch my lights out during training. I left as soon as I could for something better after a windfall from a legal settlement. I try not to touch it except to pay off cc debt a couple times a year. It's my retirement/insurance for if things go sideways again.

Got a better job but was laid off after 7 months. Got a better job, but was super disorganized and unsafe. They had me working during a 6 month remodel and large metal shelving collapsed right on my work station. Had I been at my post I would've been  hurt very badly.

Got a better job with less pay, but struggled to get there on time so they let me go after my probationary period because I was more than 8 minutes late 13 times in 4 months. That one's on me.

Got this job, more than I've ever made, less work than I've ever had to do, and the standards are extremely low which hasn't been good for me because I work to museum standards, less if necessary, but otherwise it's a bone of contention and because I'm a woman it's assumed there are some things I just can't do, despote the fact that we have j bars and forklifts which I am trained and certified to operate for things exceeding 400lbs which is about my limit in sharing a load.

I've been bullied and harassed by multiple people. I was lied to about the position where, I apploed for a trucking handling job, they offered me a crating job, and when I showed up they trained me for a prep and pack job that was super low-skill and had no work going on for 2.5 months. Aside from threading washers onto screws no one could tell me what I was supposed to be doing. I wound up helping with the warehouse to avoid seeming useless. They decided to make me the warehouse assistant for a manager who is constantly talking about his kinks and sex life and making intense eye contact while saying and doing really explicit things. 2 weeks in he said, ""Look at my coffee table last night"" and showed me a photo he took of a woman in all fours with her asshole gaping.

I tried to make the best of it for about a year, then tried to communicate what made me uncomfortable, what job I'd rather be doing, but that's when the bullying started. We also took on two more people who were kicked out of their other departments for breaking equipment or showing up drunk on job sites. One freelancer in particular was playing weird power games, pushing me out of the way, and racing me to get to jobs before I could, then he'd screw them up and I'd have to fix them anyway. I let it go for the longest until he started getting really bold, snapping at me, ordering me around like he was my superior, and while drunk at a work outing he yelled that I was disgusting for wringing water out of my relatively clean socks after spilling on them. It was too much, really embarassing, and I was then expected to give him a ride home because he lives near me.

My manager made a joke about men sharing me in a tone that was not jocular and made it obvious he knew what he was saying was fucked up, and was showing me reels of a girl doing pull ups without a shirt on and said, ""Can you believe she is only 16?""

So I finally filed a formal complaint. mind you I had told him before the underaged girl remarks made me uncomfortable as did showing me porn adjacent reels without warning. I was way too ""cool girl"" about everything because honestly I'm not that easily bothered but when it's every day and basic boundaries can't be respected, or my 10 years of experience can't be respected, it gets so old so fast.

The manager has been trying to be on good behavior but he still can't hide how much he enjoys demeaning and criticizing women which is even more stark in contrast of his glowing praise of the guys he likes to drink with. I've been looking for other work for several months, almost a year, and I haven't found anything paying as well, or good enough to make the jump. I keep telling myself I would be so happy with this job if I got it 5 years ago, it's so close to home and I get a lot of downtime and they don't mind me coming in late or leaving early if there's nothing to do. I like my health insurance. I feel like I need to leave for my mental health but I also feel stupid for leaving without something better lined up. I am tired of job hopping and was really hoping this was a place I could stay for a while and focus on other areas of my life but it's so emotionally and mentally exhausting to tap dance around all the weird manipulations and attempts to cut me down.

I just feel at a loss. I'm too tired and depressed to be making life altering decisions but I don't know if I can dig myself out of this while working here.",1,1751230431.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

I don’t plan on doing the free transit tours as I want more flexibility with my time. I will arrive at 8:15AM and my departure is at 9PM. Can someone please check my list and confirm if it’s doable given that I only have 5-6hrs in the city as the remaining hours will be spent on immigration, and transport to and from Seoul?

1. Starfield Library - I’m a big fan of libraries so I wouldn’t want to miss this. No plans on reading here. 
2. Myeongdong - badly want to eat korean street food and do some skin care shopping. Any recommended shops aside from Olive Young?
3. Gyeongbokgung Palace - just want to see the changing of guards ceremony at 2PM. 

Additional questions:

1. Is AREX the fastest way to go to Seoul main station and back to the airport? 
2. Any recommendations where to get a really good cup of coffee along Myeongdong?
3. Any must buy items for first timers? I’m not a k-pop fan so I don’t have any idea 😅

I don’t see her in a romantic way, but I wanted to reconnect as friends because honestly, it would be nice to have a lesbian friend around here, since I don’t really have that at home.

However, I’ve now heard she might see this as something more, and she’s told some mutual friends that. 
For context, we arranged this on Hinge (obviously we normally just text on insta) but I like my on hinge friends always as a joke, just liking each other to say stupid comments.

Uptown at the restaurant I was treated to the aftermath of said reunion.  The 5 ""popular girls"" who organized it were all there with their respective spouses/dates/whatevers, and were all clearly hungover.

Taylor (the one who drove out to my house to fuss about me not going) staggered up to us and told me how I missed a great time, and how it sucks that I'll have to wait 5 years for another chance to have such a good time with all my old classmates.

I told her it was my loss, but I was glad she and the others who came had fun and went back to my coffee.  She got pissy and said it was really hard for her and the others to put in so much work when so few people care, and if we don't start caring soon, then she and the others might stop caring and doing reunions and alumni events altogether.

Turns out, her and the other organizers and their significant others were the only ones that went. A total of 10 people, and 5 of them weren't even in our class.  The same 5 that have never left town, and hang out all the time anyway were the crowd. They realized they were the only ones going and decided in the couple weeks leading up to it to go meet with everyone who still lives in the area and see if they could convince them to come.  Evidently, it didn't work, and they were all having a ""poor little me"" brunch this morning up town after a night of heavy drinking at the local country club.  

I feel a little bit sad for them, honestly I think you all were right, some folks really do peak in high school, and never get past it.  The lecture from Taylor, and the stink eye I was getting from the others told me all I needed to know.  This was their chance to hold court and laud their accomplishments of yesteryear over all of us again, but no one cared enough to show up.

So Reddit, there's my ""I know why I haven't kept in contact with these people"" moment.  At least my grandad thought it was funny.  After Taylor walked away, he asked me if she was the slutty one.",140,1751229815.0,Xennials,34,0.96,False

I am loving it here so far. The weather is wonderful (I love rain), the nature is so lush and beautiful, and my spouse and I have been enjoying learning about the culture and history of Wales. However, we haven't had the best experience with people yet. Granted, we just got here a few days ago and have much more to experience, but it's been a bit rough alongside all the stress of moving to a new country and getting ready for school.

A few examples:
1. I had someone yell at me calling me an emo b*tch
2. Our air bnb host was responding quite quickly to us until we asked about a roach we saw on the counter of the kitchen (just wanted some traps or something to help get rid of em), in which now they haven't replied to us at all
3. A few people have completely ran into our shoulders on the sidewalks when we were trying to move out of the way and give em space

And this isn't to say these are Wales exclusive experiences, it's just our experiences so far and it's been a lot alongside our stress of moving and such.

I am enjoying it here a lot so far, but my spouse is really worried about fitting in and finding people who will like them. I want to show them that there are wonderful people here and that our experiences will get better. I hear great things about Welsh people and have heard nothing but good from other Americans who have visited or lived here. (My dad is having a great time lol)

Anyway, I just wanted to ask for advice on how I can help my spouse enjoy their time here a bit more and help them feel more connected to the people, not just the nature. Is there any specific events, places, or activities we should try that would help us? Maybe even just a good spot to have a drink and chat with people? Or a cool spot to get some coffee or tea?

9:41 PM – Before the Shift

The sky was quiet tonight. Not silent—quiet. Like the world was holding its breath. Not in dread, but in anticipation.

I came early again.

Not out of fear. Not out of obligation.

Because I wanted to be here.

The store was lit up like it was waiting. The windows were fogless. The tiles were freshly mopped. The red Slurpee light never twitched.

It was calm.

It was ready.

And so was I.

Miss was already by the coffee, sipping something steaming from a mug that hadn't existed the day before. She looked me up and down.

“You’ve stopped changing,” she said.

Lila appeared beside her, floating slow and soft.

“Because you’ve finished becoming,” she added.

I nodded.

“I’m not just a clerk anymore, am I?”

Miss smiled with something close to pride.

“No. You’re the Manager.”


---

10:00 PM – Shift Begins

No sound. No shift. No dread.

Just the feeling of a heavy weight being set into place.

I felt it settle across my shoulders—not like a burden, but like armor. The keys on my belt shimmered faintly. The light above Register One flickered, then stayed perfectly still.

Even the Rules on the backroom wall—handwritten, typed, scribbled, burned in—shifted slightly.

The first page now read:

> MANAGER COPY



And beneath that, in clean, ancient script:

> Welcome Back.




---

Night 31 – Nothing Happens

No Slurpee turned red.
No mirror moved.
No man in a suit at 3:33.
Not even a whisper from the vault.

It was quiet.

But not empty.

I stocked the shelves. I made fresh coffee. I helped a customer that may have had gills buy a protein bar and left a ten without needing change.

Lila danced around the aisles in a way I’d never seen—weightless, laughing.

Miss stayed close all night. Not because I needed protection.

But because this was our store now.


---

6:01 AM – After the Shift

I found the memo taped to the cooler.

Typed.

Stamped.

Signed with a looping glyph that made my skin itch when I looked at it too long.

> TO: Night Shift Clerk Mason [redacted]

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

THE PREVIOUS MANAGER HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM DUTY.

THE STORE RECOGNIZES YOU AS ITS CUSTODIAN.

STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE FOR THE DAY SHIFT.

PLEASE REFER TO THE DOOR.



There was no return address. No corporate logo.

Just a wax seal that looked disturbingly like an eye.


---

6:11 AM – The Door

Miss walked me to it.
Lila floated just behind.

The door wasn’t there yesterday. Or maybe it was—just hidden. Camouflaged into a wall of backroom tile.

But now?

Now it stood out.

Dark wood. Brass handle. A plaque, aged and worn, mounted dead center.

> MASON



I felt my heartbeat echo into the key I didn’t remember carrying.

It slid into the lock like it had always known the way.

And when I opened it… it wasn’t stairs.

It was home.

Not my home. Not a home I remembered. But one that was already mine.

A small apartment nestled beneath the bones of the store. Warm. Dustless. With walls that hummed softly, like they knew my name. The lights flicked on without a sound. A desk waited. A cot. A coat rack that held my jacket before I even hung it.

On the table was a journal.

The same leather I’d seen before.

But this one wasn’t brittle. It was waiting.

And on the first page, written in that same script:

> Congratulations, Manager.

This is only the beginning.

End of the New Job Arc

Mason’s Final Journal Entry (Arc One)

> I survived the rules.
I navigated the horrors.
I stood up for what mattered.

And the store didn’t just notice.

It welcomed me.

Lila and Miss are still here. We’re not employees. We’re parts of the same machine. And I think we’re stronger for it.

I thought I was going crazy.

Now I know—I’m finally waking up.

The third shift isn’t just a job.

It’s a calling.

No guy I've known has ever admitted to doing that. No woman I know has had any such experience apart from a handful of ultra creepy, unsafe guys. The only times I've heard of ""approaching"" being done is at bars and clubs.

I may be socially awkward but it honestly seems like such a weird thing to do: go to a woman you think is hot and randomly start speaking to her. And even if it was acceptable, how is it not insanely daunting as a task? Like what the fuck would you even say to this person?

That night went like so many of my other nights, by sitting down, googling things like ""how to draw easy"" or ""learn art quick"", but only resulting in me sitting half burnt out with a bowl of instant ramen, which at this point was ice cold. 

But one thing was different this time. Every time I picked up the pencil only one thing seemed reasonable to draw. The woman dressed in blue. I am obsessed. 
""You'll never see her again"" I think to myself. ""There is no point in thinking about her"". But I can't let her go.


Blueprint POV:
The second I get home I crash down on my couch. This day has taken every last ounce of energy out of me. From the work day at the office where I was, like usual, treated like a tool by my boss and all my coworkers. And then my run-in with that girl. That damned girl,  everything from her apron, to her eyes. Those beautiful eyes. 
""But I'm not in love!"" I yell to myself. That night I, despite my tiredness, cannot sleep until 4am, where I enter a feverish state of sleep, constantly interrupted by weird dreams.

The next day I step into the giant building I work inside like usual, I do what I'm told and wait until the shift is over. As I'm tapping away at my computer, I look up at the chock hanging on the wall. I see that my shift is over, so I grab my things and head out. Usually I'd just take the train home as fast as possible, but today I have something else in mind. I'll just walk by the coffee shop and see if that girl is there.


Brainstorm POV: 
I stand by the counter, looking out on the street, watching all the people cross by.
But in the middle of the crowded street I see something I'd never expect.

It's her. Dressed in the same blue suit as yesterday, and before I know it she's in the shop, walking up towards me, but she seems, nervous? 
""Ask for her number"" I think to myself.
I try to drop the idea, but my brain won't let me. 
""Hey, could I get a cup of black coffee please?"" I'm interrupted by the woman in blue.
""Yes, of course, will it be anything else?"" I say, desperatly trying to sound professional.
""Actually, yeah, and I know this might be weird… but I… I just wanted to ask-"" She stutters severely. 
""Can I get your number?"" She says, and I realize I said it too.
""Yeah sur-"" I stop, as I realize we were saying the same thing at the same time.


Blueprint POV:
The girl at the counter is visibly blushing as she's writing her number on a napkin, and she hands it to me. I turn around and start walking towards the door.
""Wait, can I ask one more thing please?""
I turn again after hearing her question.
""What's your name?""
She asks, still noticably blushing.
""Bella, and yours?"" I don't sound nearly as confident as I thought I would.
""Well, I'm Brooke"" I'm mildly comforted by the fact that she also sounds extremely nervous.
""So, thank you for that, but I have to go now"" I say.

When I'm out of the shop, I look at the napkin, and I almost scream out of happiness. On my way home I don't question one bit why I even asked in the first place, as I'm in a state of extreme euphoria, one I've never felt before. It's not love though, right?


Brainstorm POV:
I'm still shocked about everything. Someone who yesterday was a complete stranger to me just asked me for my number. This means she likes me too, right? But maybe she just wants to be friends. In the middle of my confusion, my phone buzzes.

I unlock it to see a message from an unknown number. It reads:
""Hey, I'm Bella from the coffee shop. I don't really know why I asked for your number in the first place, but I guess I liked you, so maybe we could be friends?""

I lay down in the bed, even more shocked than before.
""What a world"" I whisper to myself.

1lnoq1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/StructuralEngineering/comments/1lnoq1a/structuring_a_rooftop_greenhouse_in_a_lowcarbon/,Structuring a rooftop greenhouse in a low-carbon building,"Hi all,

I’m designing a two-storey building for my university architecture project. The ground floor will be a publicly accessible, homely and welcoming community space, whilst the majority of the first/top floor will be a greenhouse growing tropical fruits, herbs, and vegetables that don’t typically grow in the UK. The greenhouse will accommodate plant life such as banana trees, cocoa trees, coffee (robusta/arabica), lemon trees, orange trees, and other similar species, which means some could reach 7–9 m in height, requiring deep soil beds and heavy loads on the structure. 

I'm currently exploring how I can integrate this very heavy greenhouse into my design, but am struggling to find precedents and details I can refer to - especially ones that use low-carbon materials. 

I'm hoping to get some guidance and to discuss concepts around:

* How heavy rooftop greenhouses with deep planters and trees have been structurally accommodated in other buildings 
* Strategies for balancing openness (which certain rooms, such as a seminar room need) on the ground floor with load paths for heavy rooftop planting
* Guidance on how to size grids for support columns to ensure that they can support these heavy rooftop loads - does anybody know of any good books or sources I can use to work this out? Our university course barely touches on structural details, so I'm a little bit lost!
* Material choices that meet low-carbon goals and can help the building feel welcoming, comfortable, and homely (a leading theme of my design) - I'm currently looking at either CLT (mainly for its low-carbon impact and its atmospheric aesthetics), reinforced concrete with GGBS/PFA cement or a steel frame (for it's strength and popularity in other similar projects, but undesirable due to its high embodied carbon content unless I was able to use recycled steel?)
* Ideas on how I can figure out the weight of the plants, trees, water tanks etc., that will be inside the greenhouse and its plant room so that I can start some calculations.

I’ve researched projects like Agrotopia and Lufa Farms greenhouse structures, as well as designs such as the Eden project, but it seems that they all have steel structures and I've found it hard to source any structural details for them or any similar projects that use alternative materials. Mostly, I'm interested in finding an alternative low-carbon material choice that I can try to make work for my design, but I also want to discuss whether I could justify the use of a steel structure in a low-carbon design. 

Any conceptual insights, precedents, or structural principles you’ve seen in projects with heavy rooftop planting would be greatly appreciated! Also, looking for recommendations for any books on details, materials or structures that might help build my knowledge on this area.

Modular furniture system (tables, stools, end tables) that **interlocks using empty Zyn cans** as structural or decorative components.

📦 **Why It Works:**

* Zyn users go through tons of cans. Most just get trashed.
* The cans are **uniform (70mm x 20mm)** – perfect for repeatable geometry.
* Could be turned into a **DIY furniture kit**, 3D printable parts, or even a conversation piece brand.
* Appeals to the “bro-culture” + sustainability crowd + people who just want weird, eye-catching pieces.
* Could be crowdfunded or made open-source.

🔩 **Vision:**

* Coffee table made from interlocking hexagonal grid using Zyns + clear acrylic top
* Interchangeable connectors (3D printed or cast) that snap Zyn cans together
* Stackable furniture blocks (Lego-like)
* Possibly even branding Zyn themselves for a marketing stunt

🧠 **What’s Needed:**

* Someone to prototype the connectors
* CAD/3D skills 
* Someone to build and showcase a working version (TikTok content gold)
* Business model options: kits, plans, printed parts, full furniture builds

🛠️

* Dimensions, sketches, STL drafts
* Willing to hand this off – just credit the concept if it takes off

If you’re a 3D designer, industrial designer, or someone who likes weird viral furniture projects… take this and run with it.

I am possibly planning on upgrading in the future so my thought process is to use a majority of my budget on the grinder and then buy a better machine when I can afford. That way I dont have to upgrade both grinder and machine.

Would it be bad/good to buy a atom 65w with a bambino? Would i be better off buying a cheaper grinder and using more money on the machine?

For context I used to be attracted to a lot of things that were more lesbian coded, and more often than not I (unwantedly) had crushes for lesbian women and characters. And I really fucking hated it, I felt ashamed, I felt miserable, I wished I wasn’t born with a penis.

I started to get better though cutting out anything that could trigger me. Even though I was biromantic it was healthier for me to cut out anything relating to pride (it never was something that defined much of my identity anyway, I’m comfortable being attracted to all genders I don’t need approval), I also forbade myself from indulging in any TV series or games that would trigger my insecurity. And lastly I focused on my IRL, cleaning the house whenever I get upset, drawing each and every day, going out to the museum or for coffee, driving etc.

But now it came back again when I just randomly came across such a character I had a crush on in my 18-19 years and now I feel like shit again and I dunno when it will wash over.

I feel like I’ll never get over this, and it sucks ass. I wish I won’t feel anything eventually but I dunno at this point.

Update: BTW going on a diet has also been a large help. Hard to have negative thoughts when you feel hungry all the time lol. Anyone that has similar issues with obsessive thoughts I’d suggest considering this.

We're building a world where *everything* interacts from cabling, logic terminals, and diagnostic sensors to combat AI and massive terrain streaming. 

We’re currently a studio of 5 (3 artists, 1 composer, and myself). Now we're looking to bring on a **Godot programmer** to help us turn the design and docs into a playable reality.

  
What the Game Is:

Picture a heavily damaged Martian made tank the size of a building crawling across an impossibly large wasteland on earth. The inside of the vehicle is a web of systems: power routing, cables, in-game scripting terminals, targeting subsystems, and damage logic — all exposed to the player. Everything can be bypassed, hacked, rerouted and modified with the simple goal of surviving and arranging a rendezvous with your allies in orbit whilst being completely alone again the armies of earth.

Key mechanics include:

\- Custom **terminal system** with a fictional scripting language.

\- Manual **cabling** for power/data between components.

\- Environmental **debuffs**, damage modeling, and subsystem breakdowns.

\- World map is **gigantic** (we're talking Earth-scale, chunk-streamed terrain).

\- Combat, traversal, and survival loop are all system-simulated.

  
Who We're Looking For:

We’re not after a generic dev. We’re looking for someone who **gets excited** by simulation logic, who wants to build strange things, and who enjoys watching systems fall apart in creative ways. 

What we’d love: 

\- Solid **Godot 4** experience (or confidence learning fast).

\- Systems/logic brain (component interactions, modular code).

\- Good communicator. Chill but proactive.

\- Bonus: tools dev experience, in-engine UI, or passion for in-game scripting.

  
Compensation:

This is **rev-share, milestone-scaled**. You’ll start with a baseline share and grow it as you contribute more — we’re flexible, and the system is designed to **reward commitment** without punishing late joiners. You’ll be a **core team and studio member**, not a contractor.

  
How to Apply:

DM or comment with:

\- A quick intro + why this interests you.

\- Relevant links (GitHub, Itch, portfolio, whatever).

\- And **EXTRA IMPORTANT:** Coffee or Tea, which one do you prefer?

Wanted to post a trip report / diary as they were my favorite part of this subreddit when I was planning our trip earlier this year. This was my girlfriend’s first trip ever to Disney. I had been before but not since I was in my early teens. We are both in our 30s and this trip was my birthday present to her. We wanted to do as much as possible and due to some factors at home only had 4 park days with a travel day home as our 5th day. It was a lot. We were so tired by the end but had so much fun. Yes I know we should have taken a rest day BUT if you are looking to pack it all in and do 4 parks in 4 days… this is the trip report for you. I booked the hotel (swan) with CC points and we flew Southwest direct from Kansas City. We were up early 60 days in advance to get dining reservations and a week out for LLs - we did MP and SP for all parks except MK where we did PP. We stayed at the swan bc I was able to book through my CC and we loved the location and all the different dining options in that area. We also planned to take advantage of the Extended Evening hours for Epcot and MK since we only had 1 park per day. We purchased photo pass in advance as well. Our plan was to really blow this out as a once in a lifetime trip. Full rundown for each day below to show how we planned out our days and used LLs. 

DAY 1 Monday TRAVEL + EPCOT

Woke up at 3 for our flight out and landed at 930 at MCO. V rainy when we got there but we were ready to put on our ponchos and go. 
Ubered to the Swan Hotel and arrived at about 11. We changed our clothes in the lobby bathroom, put on ponchos, and walked straight to EPCOT. We started off with some ear shopping at Creations then to spaceship earth where we took photos as pics. One of the gf’s highest priorities was eating at the 
Coral Reef restaurant. If you have ever seen the Boy Meets World episode at Disney World that is the reason. She needed to experience being Topanga lol. We had a 1230 rez and got seated right up front next to the aquarium. The first thing she said when we sat down was that this was the table from the episdoe. She ended up asking our wonderful waiter Marcus (shoutout) and he confirmed that yes it was in fact the Topanga table and she was sitting in Topangas seat! Disney magic baby!! Our day was already made. After we lunch it was time for some attractions. We took a rainy stroll through Moana then to our first LL Living with the land 135. As we scanned in I immediately 
booked Soarin LL @ 210. Left the Land pavilion and the rain had finally cleared. We did a little more strolling & Shopping then walked on to 3 caballeros. Next we scanned into our Frozen LL @ 350 - this one was fun but the ride is short. Next to Kring la got the troll horn and frozen Viking coffee - both were absolutely legit. Walked through the rest of the showcase and back to hotel to check in at about 430 then back at park for Cosmic Rewind LL 545 - she was too freaked to go on it but later regretted that. She shopped while I rode. Got row 9 and Everybody Wants to Rule the World. This ride was incredible from start to finish. So smooth!! 
Walked to the Jardin de Fiestas booth - shared a tostada / taco / beer / cucumber marg - all great, tostada was a our fave. 
While eating she said I want to ride some rides so we hit a Spaceship earth LL 630 then walked over to the Butterfly enclosure. Grabbed a quick Mickey pretzel then to journey into Imagination LL 710 - fun! Was starting to get dark and we still wanted some snacks so we walked to the France booth - croissant (yes!) and gnocchi (skip). Did a quick walk through of Morocco then another quick walk through Japan and the dept store. At this point it was about time for fireworks so grabbed a drink and spot to watch in Italy. I was still hungry so I grabbed a quick slice from the Italy pizza window. It was HUGE and hard to eat but good. We had EE hours since we were staying at the Swan. She wanted to ride Soarin one more so we walked from Italy to Soarin 15 min wait and walked back to the Swan from Soarin… this was a mistake. We were both dead but determined to ride it anyway. A lot steps added here at the end of an already long day! 

35373 steps

DAY 2 Tuesday ANIMAL KINGDOM

Woke up slowly around 6 and had coffee at hotel and then on the bus from the swan at 715, bus showed up right when we walked up! Did some Pics out front and then Scanned in for EE at 745. Instead of going to rides we just got some coffee and luxuriated around the Tree of Life. We walked all of the trails and admired all the animals and the tree from different angles. Took tons of cool pics and there was literally NO ONE THERE the entire time. It was really cool and felt like we had the place to ourselves. Next was our Safari LL 915, was a little bit of a bust for us but saw a lioness sitting on top of the very tallest rock and that was pretty cool. From there we went directly to Festival of the Lion King @10. Excellent show. We loved it! Next up was Pandora and we hit the two rides back to back with Na’vi River LL 1045 then Flight of passage LL 1115. FoP definitely up there as one of favorite rides of the week! She absolutely loved it and super stoked about it - this ride convinced her she could ride just about anything in the parks which was a great development. Did Lunch at Satuli Canteen 1215 - mobile order cheeseburger pods / garlic shrimp noodle bowl - both were great. Sat outside and was able to find a table pretty easily. Next we did a little shopping and strolling - we got a caricature drawing which was expensive but something we wanted to do. We are definitely glad we have it now but so much money lol.  Next we walked over to Asia and watched the gibbons while sharing a Carmel iced latte. Next we had a Kali River Rapids LL 145 - it started straight up POURING RAIN while we were in line but we went on it anyway. Got extra soaked with the rain but it was a fun one with a fun group on the ride with us. Next was Everest LL 210 - sick! Probably a top 3 ride for me. Then we walked through dinoland and hit a Dinosaur LL - 3 PM. Got out of Dinosaur and did the walk up list mobile check in Nomad Lounge 315 - got a notification for our table almost immediately / Tempting Tigress / Sangria / pork sliders - we enjoyed all! Picked up our caricature and left the park at 4 / took bus back to yacht club and then walked to Swan. Chilled in the room and did a little napping. Walked over for a drink at Phins at the Dolphin then Dinner at Bluezoo 745- excellent service and food! We had such a fun dinner here but the restaurant was pretty empty on a Tuesday night. Watched the Epcot fireworks from Swan and Dolphin bridge on the home and then straight to bed!

DAY 3 Wednesday MAGIC KINGDOM - the big one! 

Up at 6 / Ubered to magic kingdom around 7 / dropped off at TTC at 715 and took the ferry in 
Scanned into the park a little before 8. Took some photos on main st and then headed to our Cindy’s Royal Table Reservation at 835. I couldn’t really find this information before we went but if you are trying to figure out what to do for your early Cindy Rez walk to Adventureland and you’ll see somebody standing over to the right of the Adventureland sign and they will check you in and send you on to the castle! Met Cindy / Aurora / Merida - missed Jasmine. Food was good but not great! Had a very fun time overall and felt like it was worth the price. We bought LL Premier Pass for this one so after Cindy we hit an Under the sea LL (it was a walk on anyway) on our way to Meet Goofy at 10 - we were the 3rd group in line for Goofy. Next was Barnstormer LL (good kiddie coaster) then on to 7 Dwarves Mine Train LL - fantastic! We really liked this one - the people on our train were really fun with lots of clapping and singing along. We walked through fantasyland and Peter Pan and small world LLs were backed up for some reason so we went to Haunted Mansion LL - not as fun as I remember but still a classic. Since we had PP we decided to walk over to Tomorrow Land bc we really needed a latte - waited in line for Joffreys for forever! Probably the longest line for us the whole week! Needed to chill out so went on PeopleMover - you cannot take drinks on it despite what Google Gemini says! Next was Monsters Inc Laugh Floor LL - felt brutal waiting for it to start and probably our least favorite attraction of the week. Would skip in the future. Next was Magic Carpets LL and it was HOT at this point so we went to ride Tiana’s LL. So fun! Another great group to ride with. Second row and we got wet but not too wet. Next was a Pirates LL (still good) followed by a Jungle Cruise LL (meh). By this time it was almost 3 so I got in line for the Spring Roll Cart and she got a spot by the bridge / Christmas shoppe to watch the parade. Parade was fun got a nice personal bow from prince phillip. We basically followed the parade out and went back to hotel at about 320 - Took the boardwalk bus again and walked back to Swan. Chilled in the room / napped / showered and went to The Fountain at the dolphin at 630 - pretty good! Just straight down the line burgers and fries type place. Walked to Boardwalk and took bus back to MK. Got in at about 745 and immediately hit Buzz LL (fun!) and Space Mountain LL (still hits) and then Checked in for the dessert party Sat down on the lawn at 850 / fireworks started at 920 - very good show. She cried. Next we got herded back over to the dessert party. We didn’t stay long and headed straight for Tron LL. This one was so much fun especially at night. We both loved it. Walked back to fantasyland and hit Peter Pan and then Small World and decided we were at our limit. We strolled around the castle and took a bunch of pictures on the way out and did some final shopping as well. We ended up leaving around 1230 and took the boardwalk bus again and then walked back to the Swan.

Day 4 Thursday HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS

Slept in a bit to 7 or 730. Grabbed lattes at the swan and strolled to HS. Scanned in around 830 walked straight up and in. Had Mickey Waffles and Bacon at Fairfax faire then Walked over to RR standby at 855 10 min wait. A banger but definitely rattled me a little bit. She was completely good and really became a total roller coaster lover at this point in the trip. Strolled over to Mickey and Minnie’s. Took photos / looked at the hands in the concrete / scanned into 940 LL 5 mins early - fun but that water scene got me! After this and RR I was definitely feeling weird so naturally we shopped a bit and walked over to star tours LL at 1020. This did not help my queasiness at all but now it’s time for Galaxys Edge. My time to shine! Walked straight to RotR scanned in 1040 LL 5 mins early. Got A mode Rise everything went perfect - sat front row was looking Kylo right in the face - an absolutely incredible ride. Feels like the movie in every way. Probably the single coolest ride I have ever been on. Took pics with Millennium Falcon / skipped Smugglers Run bc I was still feeling weird. Walked to our Ogas Reservation at 1155 - got seated at a table with another party which is kind of awkward - 
Fuzzy Tauntaun / Corellian Spike Cold Brew / Umbaran Cheese Roll - all very good probably wouldn’t go back to Ogas though just kind of awkward with the shared tables and they are really moving you through there. 
Shopped a bit in Galaxys Edge then to Echo Lake / it was hot at this point and we were TIRED / sat in the shade with Ice Cream from Epic EatsScanned in for 130 Frozen Sing a Long at about 110 - sat in theater and cooled off. Moved ToT LL back to 8 PM / Walked back to Swan and napped - we were beat at this point. Canceled our planned dinner at Sebastian’s because we were too tired Got up and moving again around 530 / walked to the Cabana Bar and Beach Club at Dolphin / food was just fine but good atmosphere and good service! Took the boat over to HS at about 7
Scanned into Toy Story Mania LL 730
Took pics on the way and walked to ToT / ToT LL 810 then ended the night with Fantasmic @9! Excellent show that was a great way to end the week!! Shopped some as the park cleared out then walked back to Swan.

25632 Steps

Day 5 Friday 

Woke up at 5 ubered to airport for 830 flight back home 

Takeaways 

Swan location is top notch but we probably walked too much. Use the boats to save steps it definitely helped in the evening when going to HS
LL is so worth it if you are short on time like we were. Premier pass was EXPENSIVE but worth it. We could have easily ridden every ride in MK if we wanted especially with EE Hours. Plus it was nice just to be able to stroll around the park and do whatever, not worrying about booking windows.  If you have a longer trip though would focus on rope dropping and use SPLLs / skip multi pass
We tried to do everything… we failed lol. Mostly missed out on shows that we wanted to see like tiki room, country bears, Indiana jones. We packed it in and had so much fun but ended up going too hard and crashing by day 4. Save yourself steps when you can and plan for rest days if you are able to!! 
Cosmic Rewind / Tron / Tower of Terror / RotR / Flight of Passage / Everest are some of my favorite rides I have ever been on. Incredible! 
Would not recommend the post party - could see pre party or seats and sips being better. The view is great but we didn’t love the herding process after the show is over and getting over to desserts. Desserts were fine but nothing to write home about. We were too tired to want to drink any alcohol so not really worth the price at that point. 
Before the trip we said we’d never go back and this was once in a lifetime. Last week we both just said we need to plan another trip.

1lnof3o,https://microbialcell.com/researcharticles/2025a-alao-microbial-cell/,"New study shows caffeine activates key cellular pathway, triggering anti-aging effects in cells","Your morning coffee might be doing more than waking you up—it could help your cells fight aging. 

Here’s how caffeine may slow the clock. 

 Scientists at Queen Mary University of London and the Francis Crick Institute have found that caffeine activates a key energy-sensing pathway in cells known as AMPK. This pathway influences how cells grow, repair damage, and handle stress—three essential processes for healthy aging. Using fission yeast as a model, the study uncovered how caffeine indirectly regulates another crucial growth regulator, TOR, by flipping the AMPK ""fuel gauge"" switch.

The implications are intriguing: this mechanism might one day lead to caffeine-based therapies to promote longevity, similar to how the diabetes drug metformin works. While this early research was conducted on yeast cells, the AMPK-TOR pathway is highly conserved across species, making the findings a promising first step. Until such treatments exist, your morning cup of coffee might already be offering more than just a jolt of energy—it could be giving your cells a longer lease on life.",15,1751228189.0,HotScienceNews,1,0.95,False

9:42 PM – Before the Shift

There was frost on the inside of the front windows.

Not condensation. Frost.

Tiny webs of it etched like veins across the glass, spiraling out from the corner where the Totem logo used to be, before the latest renovation. I touched it with my glove—it bit my skin through the leather like it didn’t want to melt.

Miss was already here, pacing. Her coat tonight was sleeker, tighter. She looked like she was expecting a fight.

Lila hovered near the coffee machine, watching it warily.

No one said anything.

I placed a box of wrapped taffy on the counter for Lila—hand-pulled stuff from a candy shop two towns over. Her eyes lit up, but she didn’t approach right away. She was too focused on the store.

The air smelled… off.

Not just cold.

Ash.

10:00 PM – Shift Begins

The moment the registers ticked over to third shift, the overhead hum of the lights shifted pitch.

You don’t notice until you’ve heard it too many times—like a fly in your ear.

I did my walk. Stocked the shelves. Cleaned the hot food case. Checked the Slurpee machine—normal, thankfully.

Coffee machine: filled and brewing. I’d brought backup beans in a ziplock bag from home.

I wasn’t making that mistake again.

I had just finished mopping the corner near the ATM when I heard it.

A chugging, like syrup through a straw.

Then a wet gasp.

Then silence.

12:17 AM – The Black Slurpee Drinker Returns

He came through the back.

Not the front door. Not the side. The back wall.

There’s no door there. No frame. But somehow he peeled the drywall open and stepped through like it was a curtain.

Same clothes as last night’s “full roast” guy.

But this one was taller. Broader. And his skin looked grayish, like overused clay.

His eyes dripped black. Slurpee, I think.

I didn’t ask.

He came at me fast.


---

The Fight

It wasn’t a movie brawl. There were no cool lines. I grabbed the wet floor sign and cracked it across his shoulder. He didn’t even flinch. Knocked me into the freezer door.

Pain shot up my arm.

I grabbed the coffee pot. Hot, fresh, and scalding. Threw it in his face.

He screamed. The scream rattled my fillings. Sounded like three voices screaming at once—mine, Lila’s, and someone I haven’t met yet.

He lunged again.

This time, I pulled the fire extinguisher and let him have it—white foam straight in the mouth, until he collapsed choking and twitching, trying to vomit out something that wasn’t food.

Miss appeared next to me.

“You’re bleeding,” she said.

“I noticed.”

She pulled back my sleeve. My forearm was torn—three claw marks, deep and oozing. My ribs were bruised. Probably cracked. I felt like I’d been in a car accident.

Lila stepped out from the back.

“Do we… need the phone?” she asked.

“No,” I panted. “He’s not getting back up.”

Miss leaned close to what was left of the thing. It twitched once. She snapped her fingers. A spark of violet light flared and the body disintegrated—turned to black ice, then cracked, then melted.

Gone.


---

3:33 AM – Everything Is Quiet Again

I wrapped my arm in gauze from the first-aid kit. Not enough. But it would do.

I made coffee. This time it didn’t talk back.

I watched the frost crawl inward from the windows. Winter was here.

Lila sat next to me on the floor again, legs crossed, mimicking my posture. She offered me a piece of the taffy I bought her. I took it with shaking fingers.

“You shouldn’t stay,” she whispered.

“I’m starting to think that too.”

“...But I’m glad you do.”

Miss leaned against the chip rack, watching both of us with her strange, sharp eyes. Her fur coat had thawed at the edges.

“I told you the store was waking up too fast,” she said.

“Yeah.”

“And now it knows you bleed.”


---

End of Night 26

Mason’s Journal Entry:

> First time I’ve bled on shift.

Whatever drank the black Slurpee didn’t stay human.

Miss said she could smell its memory before it entered.
Lila’s taffy helped more than the gauze.

If I die here…
I just hope I get to haunt this place like her.

At least I wouldn’t be alone.

1lnoc8p,https://imgur.com/a/AcnWEU5,Antibiotics contributing to rapid teeth staining?,"I recently went for a cleaning, and the same week I went on antibiotics (amox/clav) for a non-dental related reason.  A few days after starting the antibiotics I noticed my mouth feeling very dry at night, then started feeling like I needed to brush my teeth way more often.  They felt fuzzy even right after brushing.  I started using Biotene for dry mouth at night and once the course of antibiotics was finished both issues resolved themselves.  

About a week or two later I noticed brand new and significant teeth staining.

I went to my GP and mentioned I had been sick a lot this year, and shared the details above and that I had a dentist appt scheduled.  She recommended I get a blood panel and asked me to update her after I saw my dentist.  We discussed the possibility of an immune related issue but she wanted to wait to pursue additional testing until after hearing what the dentist said.

My guess is that the antibiotics altered the pH of my mouth which created an environment for increased plaque buildup, which caused the accelerated staining.

The dentist told me he couldn’t tell what the cause was, but that it was standard staining caused by tartar buildup.  I’m going in for my second cleaning in two months on Tuesday and he seemed confident he could remove the staining.

Does anyone have any ideas about what this could have been caused by?

I have good oral hygiene (brush 2x and floss every day), drink but don’t smoke, and i drink a lot of coffee.  Dentist also shared that I needed to be brushing up and down/circular more than I currently am, so I guess I need to relearn to brush my teeth lol but I didn’t think that was a direct cause since the staining occurred so rapidly, I have never experienced anything like this before, and it all happened within two weeks after my biannual cleaning.
