I am NBSB, and to be honest I'm not looking for anyone. Basically, I just stopped being interested and stopped waiting for someone to come along. I haven't been interested in anyone for almost 5 yrs now, after I've confessed to my close male friend years ago. I always thought he was my soulmate and I'd like a partner where we started as friends. But he did not reciprocate my feelings, and I had come to terms with it. However, I gave up on finding a partner since then. I am quite happy living alone, and I enjoy my singlehood. 

Context: I met a guy last week, also pinoy in late 30s. Now, even though I never had an actual relationship, I am not clueless when a guy kind of sends a message like they're interested. So this guy I just met would SMS me such as good morning, good night, take care -- everyday. Would invite me to coffee or church and the like. I'm new here in this foreign country. So TBH I would appreciate having new friends too, or maybe even date if that's where this might go.

However, I suddenly thought of looking up this guy on Facebook (which I haven't thought of yet the last few days), and lo and behold it says he's married. And on further digging, I have found his partner's name (who i believe is currently in the Philippines).

Advice needed: So now I don't even know if I should continue being friends with this person, or should I just ignore him? Or should I confront him that I learned he is married based on my FB investigative skills? It's not like I've seen him a lot. I don't want to be ""assuming"" and think he's interested in me or anything, what if he just wanted to be friends really? But then again, I don't want to affect anyone's relationship either. Esp since he never mentioned he has a wife (and probably a kid, based on the FB pics I saw) and we've only ever talked about getting to know you stuff.",1,1751205904.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False
1lnfhfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lnfhfp/i_dont_think_i_can_feasibly_do_all_the_lifestyle/,I don't think I can feasibly do all the lifestyle changes for LPR,"After taking honestly everything under the sun for a suspected sinus problem, the ENT I saw said my symptoms may be silent reflux. I'm currently on 80mg of omeprazole a day for three months to see if it helps. I've only been on it for like three days, so no improvement yet.

The issue is I don't know if I can do a lot of the lifestyle changes recommended for LPR.

Let me explain:

**Eat smaller, more frequent meals.** I'm eating 1200 calories a day and I intentionally cut down to two meals a day because trying to make three 400-calorie meals that were satisfying was too difficult. I would have to essentially have snacks all day instead of meals in order to make small frequent meals work on a calorie deficit.

**Sleep on your side.** This is a huge 100 percent NOPE. I can only fall asleep on my stomach. I have tried to sleep in other positions, and everyone says that I can fall asleep if I'm tired enough. I cannot. I already don't get enough sleep as it is and I'm not going to get less sleep trying to force myself to sleep in a position that I know I will not be able to sleep in.

**Wedge pillow.** Also nope because I can only sleep if I lay completely flat. Like I can't even sleep on pillows that are too fluffy because it's uncomfortable. I have a dense down pillow that's like 30 years old and super flat. I have tried sleeping on a wedge pillow and it didn't work. I couldn't sleep at all, even when tired.

**Lose weight.** I lost 50 pounds and have been trying to lose more, but my body just plain will not cooperate. What I want to know is why I didn't have reflux when I was almost 300 pounds? Why has it shown up after I dropped a good chunk of weight?

**Wear loose clothes.** I'm not replacing all my pants on the off chance it will help my symptoms. It's hard enough for me to find clothes that fit in the first place.

__________________________________________________________

I was already doing some of the recommended changes without trying. I don't drink or smoke in the first place. I already drink upwards of 64 ounces of water a day. I'm not under much stress. I limit my carbonated beverage intake and have a diet pop maybe once a month, and I don't consume much citrus. I do drink coffee, but only one cup a day. I don't eat much fat because of my calorie-restrictive diet.

I don't consume many of the trigger foods. Mostly I eat pineapple, tomato, onions and spicy things, but not all the time. I can easily lose the pineapple. But some sources say to just limit these things while others say to eliminate them entirely, so I have no idea which one to believe. I have not noticed my symptoms worsening after eating any particular foods, so I don't even know if those are considered trigger foods for me.

From what I've seen, lifestyle changes are more important for LPR than medication. So am I just doomed to have LPR forever because I'm unable to do a lot of the recommended changes?",1,1751205897.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

The gleaming copper chrome finish immediately caught my eye when setting it up on my countertop. It's sleek, compact, and has just enough of that retro-modern vibe to fit right into any kitchen decor, from traditional to contemporary. Right off the bat, this product screams quality and functionality, with its 1.7-liter capacity designed to handle everything from a cozy tea session for one to a large family gathering. But let‚Äôs get into the nitty-gritty of how it performs, as there‚Äôs more than meets the eye with this lovely kettle.

**Design and Build Quality That Steals the Show**  
The design of this electric kettle is as much about aesthetics as it is about utility. The gooseneck-style spout adds a touch of elegance while enabling precise pours, which is especially useful for crafting pour-over coffee or delicately filling teacups without creating messes all over the counter. At 1.57 kilograms, the kettle is sturdy enough to sit snugly without feeling too heavy. I also appreciate the heat-resistant transparency of the material‚Äîit lets you watch the water boil, giving off this odd sense of satisfaction. The 360-degree swivel base with cord storage is a lifesaver in my very limited kitchen space.  

**See BELLA 14753 deals on Amazon now.**  
[Check the current price and features here](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b07hrq9bq6/).  

If you‚Äôre like me‚Äîforever juggling tasks‚Äîthe automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection could very well be your kitchen superhero. There‚Äôs no more worrying if I‚Äôve accidentally left it running while rushing out the door. It‚Äôs safe, straightforward, and makes me wonder why I stuck with stove-top versions for so long!

**Boiling Performance and Versatility**  
When it comes to performance, this kettle truly delivers. The 1500-watt heating element boils water super quickly‚Äîso fast that it‚Äôs almost like having a speed-boiling genie. I timed it against my microwave out of pure curiosity, and there was no competition; the kettle won hands down. Whether it‚Äôs for tea, coffee, oatmeal, or even instant noodles during those late-night cravings, the BELLA came through every single time. Having gotten used to slower stovetop kettles, I‚Äôve become spoiled by how fast this one gets the job done.  

Safety is another area where this kettle shines. The concealed heating element not only aids longevity but also plays into its safety-focused design. I was initially worried about over-pours when using the long spout, but in practice, it provides great control. Even my teenage daughter, who‚Äôs still perfecting the art of making tea, found it easy and mess-free. Keeping usability in mind, its three-foot-long cable ensures you can plug it in without rearranging kitchen appliances.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Sleek copper chrome finish fits any kitchen aesthetic.  
‚Ä¢ Rapid 1500-watt boiling capability saves time.  
‚Ä¢ Thoughtful safety features like automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection.  

**Bad Points**  
‚Ä¢ The gooseneck spout, while elegant, may not appeal to everyone‚Äôs pouring style.  
‚Ä¢ Limited cord length might be inconvenient for kitchens without nearby outlets.    

**Product Rivals You Should Know About**  
While the BELLA 14753 has carved out a niche with its stylish design and robust safety features, there are other options to consider. For instance, the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle also boasts quick boiling and similar aesthetics, but it lacks the unique copper chrome finish that makes the BELLA stand out. I‚Äôve also used the Cuisinart PerfecTemp kettle, which offers variable temperature settings. However, for standard boiling tasks, I found the BELLA simpler and more efficient. The Cuisinart felt a bit bulky to manage, and its additional features didn‚Äôt justify the higher price for my everyday needs.  

If style is important to you, the BELLA easily outshines competitors like the basic stainless steel models from Black+Decker. It adds that ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that helps make something as mundane as boiling water feel a little more fun and engaging.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When weighing price against features, this kettle hits the sweet spot. With so many electric kettles out there, you‚Äôll find models with higher or lower price tags, but this one lands in the goldilocks zone. Its durability and performance ensure you‚Äôre making a smart, long-term investment. The safety features and how fast it boils water add extra value, especially for busy individuals or families. It may not have bells and whistles like adjustable temperatures, but for daily boiling needs, it‚Äôs perfect.",1,1751205627.0,TestedAtHome,0,1.0,False

1lnf9pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenhouses/comments/1lnf9pc/advice_needed_structure_materials_for_a_heavy/,Advice needed: Structure & materials for a heavy rooftop greenhouse building design,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm designing a two-storey building for my university architecture project. The ground floor will be a publicly accessible community space, whilst the majority of the¬†**first/top floor will be a greenhouse**¬†growing¬†**tropical fruits, herbs, and vegetables that don‚Äôt typically grow in the UK**.

The greenhouse will house plant life such as¬†**banana trees, cocoa trees, coffee (robusta/arabica), lemon trees, orange trees, and other similar species**, which means some could reach¬†**7‚Äì9‚ÄØm in height**, requiring deep soil beds and heavy loads on the structure.

# What I need help with:

* **What structural system and materials would be best suited to support a heavy rooftop greenhouse like this, while aligning with net-zero / low-carbon design principles?**
* **Are there recommended grid sizes for columns under such a structure that balance openness on the ground floor with the heavy loads above?**
* **Any tips on material choices (e.g., steel, glulam, reinforced concrete) to help the building feel welcoming, comfortable, and homely (a leading theme of my design) while supporting the greenhouse loads?**
* If anyone has¬†**examples or details of similar rooftop greenhouse projects**, I would really appreciate it.

# Constraints:

* UK climate
* Low-carbon / net-zero focus
* The leading theme of my design is that it is a welcoming, comfortable and homely building that is to be a place that makes¬†*all*¬†of the community want to visit and return to - from my research and experience, materiality can have an impact on these feelings
* Building height: 2 storeys, with the greenhouse dominating the top floor
* Greenhouse clear height: potentially 10‚Äì11‚ÄØm internally to accommodate the taller trees

I‚Äôve researched projects like Agrotopia and Lufa Farms greenhouse structures as well as designs such as the Eden project, but would love advice from structural and architectural perspectives on how best to integrate this into a welcoming, low-carbon community building.

Any insights, resources, or critical advice you can share would be very much appreciated!

1lnf7rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1lnf7rz/hoe_phase_gone_bad/,Hoe Phase Gone Bad,"
I wanna share a story, a MALASJuicy that kinda made me stop my hoe phase a few years ago. If you recognize this because I told you before, you already know me , quiet na lang tayo friend haha

I know some people might judge me, but I really learned my lesson the hard way. So if you don‚Äôt have anything kind to say, please just keep it to yourself. It really won‚Äôt help.

Back then, I was in my hoe phase. Some of the guys I hooked up with weren‚Äôt really my type but were good in bed, some were decent looking but honestly sucked in bed. Some I met on Reddit, some on dating apps.

Anyway, one time I matched with this guy on Bumble. Good-looking, nice body üò≠. Wala syang kotse at hindi mayaman na galing sa sikat na university. So I thought, minsan lang makatry ng masarap sa mata. lol (karma) Normally, I‚Äôd rather do a quick coffee first before going to someone‚Äôs place, just to make sure there‚Äôs some kind of physical attraction. Pero he was super insistent on going straight to his place. Bad idea, I know. My head was kinda messed up that time too my PCOS medss were making me feel off emotionally and hormonally,  so I agreed.

On the way there, I already felt this weird, heavy feeling like I was nervous in a bad way. But I went anyway. Please, wag nyo dedmahin ang gut feeling like what I did baka mas worst pa mangyari.

So yeah, we did it, obviously, there was no condm. I was caught up in the moment and let him go raw. But I told him so many times not to finish inside me. Ang higpit pa ng yakap niya and he still came inside. And I wasn‚Äôt even satisfied. I feel like pinagparausan lang ako.

He didn‚Äôt offer me water, a tissue, nothing. I took a shower and saw a feminine wash in the bathroom. When I asked, he was like, ‚Äúsa kapatid ko.‚Äù Na minsan daw nandun. Okay‚Ä¶ sure. 

Then we were just sitting there  he was scrolling on his phone and kinda playing with my nipples while I stared at the TV. Total dead air.

He He told me that the apartment actually coworker nya nag istay who was pregnant and lived there with her boyfriend. He used to live there before, kumbaga pinasalo nya sa kawork nya yung unit. Apparently, he only stays there sometimes kapag wala yung couple sa apartment, and he actually had his own condo nearby. Weird but I kinda brushed it off because I thought this was just a casual thing anyway.

A bit later, he says he‚Äôs gonna take his laundry to his condo and come back for round two. Sabi ko, if you leave, I‚Äôm just gonna go home. Pero he kept saying, ‚ÄúSaglit lang, wait ka. Another round pa tayo‚Äù so I stayed because I was not satisfied.

A few minutes later, he texts me that his female friend was on her way home, so I had to leave. So I rushed out and even left some of my stuff there.

He didn‚Äôt even bother coming back to see me off. Took me a whole week to get my stuff back. And only because I kept following up he never initiated any updates. Pero may lakas pa rin siya to reply to my IG story saying ‚Äúang sarap mo talaga.‚Äù

I felt so used, like I was just someone to get off with. Super gross feeling. It honestly made me feel like some kind of disposable hookup. Sobrang baba ng tingin ko sa sarili because of that guy. Iniiyakan ko yung nangyari sakin, how stupid I was. Took me months to move on. It hit me hard. People here might say ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù ko ‚Äòto. No one deserves it.

That was the moment I realized I needed to respect myself more. I learned the hard way that not everyone who‚Äôs ‚Äúnice‚Äù or ‚Äúhot‚Äù deserves your time, or your body. Being careful, putting your safety and self-worth first, and sticking to your boundaries isn‚Äôt something to feel bad about. It‚Äôs something you owe yourself.

If you‚Äôre going through a similar phase or thinking about casual hook-ups, my biggest advice is this:

- Trust your gut, if something feels off, listen to it.
- Meet in a public place first before deciding to go further.
- Never let anyone pressure you into something you‚Äôre not comfortable with.
- And most importantly, value yourself enough to walk away if someone‚Äôs making you feel like you‚Äôre just an option or a convenience.

You deserve to feel respected and safe, even in casual situations. Don‚Äôt settle for less. ü´∂",1,1751205176.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

But, you know, let me tell you, let me tell you. Sure, I'm not opposed in the sense that anyone should play wherever they feel comfortable playing, you know? But the thing is, the thing is, even if you supposedly transition to a female, you know, you still have some biological attributes of a male. I'm sorry to say this.

I‚Äôm designing a two-storey building for my university architecture project. The ground floor will be a publicly accessible community space, whilst the majority of the¬†**first/top floor will be a greenhouse**¬†growing¬†**tropical fruits, herbs, and vegetables that don‚Äôt typically grow in the UK**.

The greenhouse will house plant life such as¬†**banana trees, cocoa trees, coffee (robusta/arabica), lemon trees, orange trees, and other similar species**, which means some could reach¬†**7‚Äì9‚ÄØm in height**, requiring deep soil beds and heavy loads on the structure.

# What I need help with:

* **What structural system and materials would be best suited to support a heavy rooftop greenhouse like this, while aligning with net-zero / low-carbon design principles?**
* **Are there recommended grid sizes for columns under such a structure that balance openness on the ground floor with the heavy loads above?**
* **Any tips on material choices (e.g., steel, glulam, reinforced concrete) to help the building feel welcoming, comfortable, and homely (a leading theme of my design) while supporting the greenhouse loads?**
* If anyone has¬†**examples or details of similar rooftop greenhouse projects**, I would really appreciate it.

# Constraints:

* UK climate
* Low-carbon / net-zero focus
* The leading theme of my design is that it is a welcoming, comfortable and homely building that is to be a place that makes¬†*all*¬†of the community want to visit and return to - from my research and experience, materiality can have an impact on these feelings
* Building height: 2 storeys, with the greenhouse dominating the top floor
* Greenhouse clear height: potentially 10‚Äì11‚ÄØm internally to accommodate the taller trees

I‚Äôve researched projects like Agrotopia and Lufa Farms greenhouse structures as well as designs such as the Eden project, but would love advice from structural and architectural perspectives on how best to integrate this into a welcoming, low-carbon community building.

Looking for your first grinder, or one to give to a friend to start their home coffee journey?

I repair coffee equipment and have recently started grabbing broken/abandoned machines to restore and find a second home. Right now, I have two white Fellow Opus and one black Baratza Encore.

One Opus just needed a connection on the board tightened - the burrs feel as sharp as brand new. The original owner told me that Fellow just sent him a replacement under warranty. The other Opus seems to have been used a bit (burrs aren't as sharp) but only needed relubrication in the gears - nothing in the grinder was ""broken."" The Baratza Encore's drive gear was broken and has been replaced. I'm happy to send more detailed photos/videos to anybody interested in any of the grinders.

Asking prices:

Newer Opus - $120
Used Opus - $100
Used Baratza Encore - $80

I can also mod either of the Opus grinders to be stepless for an additional $20 to cover the labor.

The night brought out delinquents like her, fools chasing waning moons and swaying down sidewalks. The night never called, it beckoned, always rewarding with busy spaces silent. The night never asked her to amount to anything, and it sat with her in nothingness. The night was alive with the humming telephone wires, connecting dreamer to dream, wakefulness to sleep. The night never asked how she got there, but lured her with flickering stars, distant sounds of sirens, and the red glow of stoplights on wet cement. The night was filled with mischief of things that cannot be undone. The night was sacred, always echoing her footsteps back to her, so she never had to walk alone. The man in the moon always watched over her, and in it she saw your face. The night had only ears, and would never tell her secrets. The night had always offered escape, to change her into leaves floating down into storm drains. The night she thought was beautiful, because its darkness was in likeness of her.


The dawn was unfamiliar. It didn‚Äôt beg her to change. The dawn simply stood at the edge of her world, illuminating every shattered piece until they shimmered with potential. The dawn revealed the mess that night had hidden, the tear tracks drying on pillowcases, the empty glasses with chipped edges. The dawn never rushed its light across the sky, and painted slowly, deliberately, as if it knew the world should be graced with more time. The dawn didn‚Äôt knock, it slipped through curtain cracks, warmed cold coffee mugs, and called upon the songbirds. The dawn was gentle in uncovering what night let her ignore. When the world was still tangled in yesterdays problems, the dawn was the first to forgive, whispering that you can start again.

While the night knew her shadows by name, the dawn gently asked for her truth.
The night could hold her brokenness but the dawn silently invited her to begin again. 

She had always loved the night, but it was the dawn that touched her.

 The ""mall"" is mostly closed on the weekends. It's just us and a coffee shop, otherwise we don't get a lot of foot traffic. All the other stores are closed for the weekend.

It's very quiet. The washrooms are also closed to the public. 

I book a few patients in and then I have to go to the washroom because I'm on day 1 of my period and bleeding through a tampon. 

Unfortunately there is NO washroom in our clinic.  

But we have a staff washroom key. I take it out and leave my clinic to go to the locked (usually publically open) washroom in the mall. 

I unlock the door and a  
lady barges in behind me to also use the washroom.

I do my business. But when I come out a security guard (M,late 30s) is standing outside and says ""you cannot be in here"" In a super condescending tone, like I am a child.


I quickly say ""I work here"" in a neutral tone and He says again ""well you can't be here"" and I say again that ""I work here."" And I just keep walking back to my clinic.

I go back to work and the security guard follows me stands at the threshhold of the clinic to say ""you aren't supposed to be in that washroom on the weekends and I should have told the woman behind me to leave.""

Mind you there is NO other washroom for me to use whatsoever without leaving the building!! 

I'm the only person at work and I'm on my period so I'm trying to be quick about it. 

I immediately say ""it isn't my job to police who sneaks in behind me.""

And then he snapped at me again saying ""I should have told the woman to leave"" which to me is just ludicrous.

so I finally say ""don't scold me. I got it.""

Anyways. I'm usually a pretty meek/shy person and I have trouble speaking up for myself. I don't snap at people EVER but this irritated me because I'm just trying to do my job.

I also feel bad that I snapped at him so I'm kind of overthinking it. Was I the asshole here?

Well turns out he actually does not want my name on the house and started telling me the only reason I would want to be on the mortgage was if I wanted to divorce him and take half of it. Then he changed his mind and said it would cost money to add my name and we can find a way to get my name changed without spending any money. I was obviously hurt and offended that he would insinuate after just a few weeks I plan to divorce him for half of a house. We have been together for years and I was thrilled to get married. 

We did get into an argument last night and I eventually started crying. He told me, ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt stop crying then we can finish this discussion when you calm down.‚Äù He never came back to bed and slept on the couch.

This morning, he was woken up by me getting coffee. The argument continued and he told me to shut up and leave. I told him no and he said he was going to call the cops then. I told him to leave and he said it‚Äôs my house. 

I‚Äôm devastated. I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. Even if he apologizes, he could continue to threaten this when he gets angry. I don‚Äôt want to live in limbo or question if he‚Äôs going to kick me out. We are married. ",8,1751203640.0,AmIOverreacting,22,0.9,False

If you're reading this, you probably studied more hours than you slept, sacrificed your social life (if you had one), and still ended up scoring so low that even the attendance percentage feels proud.



Let me walk you through my tragic love story with books, hope, and disappointment.




‚òï Phase 1: Motivation ‚Äì The Fake Beginning


I woke up one fine day, did my morning chai ritual and said to myself,

""Bas. From today, full serious. 14 hours study daily. No distractions.""

So I made the perfect timetable. Colour-coded, divided into chapters, breaks, revision slots, and even spiritual time for crying.

But I forgot the most important thing ‚Äì sticking to it.



üìö Phase 2: The Hardcore Grind (a.k.a. Acting Busy)


For 14 days straight:

I sat on my chair.
Opened the same page.
Highlighted random lines (even the index).
Drank 3 cups of coffee.
Scrolled through 47 motivational reels.
And somehow convinced my brain that this was called studying.


Reality: My brain retained less than what a broken chalkboard could.



ü§Ø Phase 3: The Night Before Exam ‚Äì Panic Mode Activated 


I realized I had covered:

30% syllabus
60% doubt
100% anxiety
Called my topper friend. They were already on 2nd revision. I, on the other hand, was just discovering that the syllabus had a back page.


üò∂ Phase 4: The Exam


Walked into the hall like a warrior.

First question: I knew nothing.
Second question: Same.
Third question: I thought I knew‚Ä¶ until I read it twice.
I started writing random answers with full confidence. At one point, I think I wrote lyrics of an Arijit Singh song just to fill the space



ü™¶ Phase 5: The Results ‚Äì R.I.P. My Hopes


When I opened the result portal, even the website hesitated:

""Are you sure you want to see this?""

And there it was. 14%.

Even my attendance was higher. Even the number of pending assignments was higher.




ü§° Moral of the Story?


Sometimes, you do everything ""right"" and still get it wrong.

But hey, if you‚Äôre gonna fail, at least fail with flair.



Let your report card say,

""Yes, he fell‚Ä¶ but he fell like a king.""



If you liked this blog and also failed recently, congrats. You're my people.

I really care about her and I shared with her lots of memories and beautiful moments. 

Since 2021 my friend (let's call her Sarah) started hanging out with this new group of girls, younger than us, still studying at University. I apparently became boring because I could no longer live the ""university nightlife"" since I work two jobs. I did my best to still plan moments with Sarah but she seemed to prefer other ppl and other activities over me. 
We grew apart but I still cared about her, still cherished every moment we could spend together.

We had a disagreement last year because I had to face a difficult situation and she apparently couldn't even find the time to grab a coffee with me while still having plenty of time and money for her new hobbies and new friends. We managed to get over it. I thought our friendship was strong.

Last year her new friend group  started falling apart because everyone finished university and suddenly everyone was building their own life. 
Suddenly Sarah was interested too in finding a job. She literally spent 6 months just to fix her CV without getting any job interview. Then se tried to apply to one single job position and it failed.  
Since I care about Sarah, I stepped in and found her an interview. She got a contract for one year in a field that is actually related to her major degree. Unfortunately this appended in January and the contract is supposed to start in September. She started to complain with me about the fact that she was wasting her time waiting to start the job I found for her. 
So she decided to look for other jobs to do in the meantime but she couldn't find anything. 
I stepped in again and in a week I found her another small summer job she can do (nothing fancy, but still something to make a little money in the meantime) I went as far as asking my father to recommend her for this specific position, something I never even asked for myself... 
Last week I texted her to ask how she was doing and if she was happy about her new job. I was genuinely happy for her... However she almost immediately started complaining again because apparently the job won't pay her enough to justify her leaving her house. 
To be clear: I never forced her to accept it. She just forgot to discuss salary and logistics before accepting the offer. 

So yes, it's the second time I find her a job in less than a year. It's the second time she's complaining with ME about the job I got for her. I'm sorry I can't find a CEO position for her,  but unfortunately I can't change the whole job markey in our country. I'm too struggling to scrape by.

I'm getting so frustrated because sometimes a little gratitude would be nice... Or at least just not complain with me about the efforts I'm making for her. 
I feel like I don't want to hang out with her anymore. I don't want to listen to her complain about her job (or the lack of it). I'm fed up and I don't know If I want to talk to her about it just to be the only one concerned, the only one doing the emotional labour. 
I don't want to go no contact with her but at the same time I don't want to step in now that her ""other cool friends"" moved away.  AITA for feeling like this?

1lnehmx,https://i.redd.it/hfo0srkx9v9f1.jpeg,7 years ago + 3 years ago: a transition,"In the annals of 1990s television history, Home Improvement stood out as a testosterone-fueled celebration of tools, grunting, and good ol‚Äô American dad energy. At the center of it all was Tim ‚ÄúThe Tool Man‚Äù Taylor‚Äîa man of simple pleasures: souped-up engines, explosions in the name of DIY science, and questionable parenting wisdom. Yet beneath the surface of this plaid-clad patriarch may lie a secret obsession that not even Wilson‚Äôs fence could hide: the underground world of coffee enemas.

Let us begin with motive. Tim is obsessed with performance enhancement. Whether it‚Äôs a lawnmower engine or a dishwasher, his mantra‚Äî‚ÄúMore power!‚Äù‚Äîserves as a constant refrain. But what if this ideology extended beyond the garage and into the bathroom? What if Tim wasn‚Äôt just trying to supercharge his garbage disposal, but his digestive system?

Tim Taylor is, canonically, reckless with machines, explosions, and his health. He regularly electrocutes himself, inhales toxic fumes, and lifts heavy objects without proper back support. Is it really that far-fetched to imagine that Tim might have heard about the ‚Äúdetoxifying‚Äù effects of a piping hot Columbian roast‚Äîadministered rectally‚Äîand thought, ‚ÄúWell heck, I bet I could rig up a pressure-regulated enema contraption with a drip timer and a Craftsman shop vac hose.‚Äù

There‚Äôs circumstantial evidence to support this theory. For instance:
	1.	Episode 4, Season 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúA Sewage Situation‚Äù
Tim installs a bidet for Jill, but ends up turning it into a high-pressure cleaning system that floods the bathroom. A bidet is just one tube away from an enema, folks.
	2.	Season 5 ‚Äì The Tool Time Health Special
In a bizarre segment sponsored by a fictional health food store, Tim scoffs at green juice, but jokingly says, ‚ÄúI get my caffeine the old-fashioned way‚Äîabsorbed through the skin!‚Äù He‚Äôs kidding, right? Or was that a Freudian slip?
	3.	Wilson
Tim‚Äôs enigmatic neighbor constantly doles out worldly wisdom about holistic health practices. It is entirely plausible that during one of their over-the-fence chats, Wilson introduced Tim to the world of enemas, perhaps citing ancient Ayurvedic medicine. Wilson: ‚ÄúYou know, Tim, in some cultures, coffee enemas are seen as a form of spiritual cleansing.‚Äù Tim: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say‚Ä¶ does it come with a filter?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs also not forget Tim‚Äôs tendency to turn every mundane task into an opportunity for invention. If anyone were to build a coffee enema machine with a timing system, internal thermostat, and an emergency shutoff valve, it would be this man. He once turned a barbecue grill into a jet engine‚Äîhe‚Äôd have no problem converting a Mr. Coffee into a backdoor barista.

Now, we must address the psychology. Tim‚Äôs relentless pursuit of control and optimization is textbook overcompensation. The man‚Äôs ego is fragile‚Äîhe needs to outshine Al Borland, impress Jill, and command respect from his three boys. Coffee enemas‚Äîbizarre, extreme, and taboo‚Äîare the perfect metaphor for Tim‚Äôs internal contradictions: externally rugged, internally delicate. The colon is the one tool he can‚Äôt fix with duct tape. A coffee enema represents his last, desperate effort to cleanse away his emotional clutter.

Could this explain his seemingly random bursts of energy? The moments when he goes from groggy to hyperactive between commercial breaks? Caffeine absorbed through the colon bypasses the liver, entering the bloodstream almost immediately. It‚Äôs the nitrous oxide of natural stimulants. Maybe that ‚ÄúMore power!‚Äù grunt wasn‚Äôt just metaphorical. Maybe Tim was genuinely jacked up‚Äîon espresso, via enema.

Let‚Äôs also consider Jill. She‚Äôs a psychology student‚Äîsomeone trained to look for the signs of repression and displacement. Her frequent exasperation with Tim‚Äôs bathroom habits, though always played for laughs, could be a subtle nod to this secret ritual. Perhaps the reason Tim spends so long in the bathroom isn‚Äôt plumbing mishaps‚Ä¶ but internal plumbing management.

And what about the Tool Time studio‚Äôs off-camera budget? Is it coincidence that the craft services table always has an abundance of fresh-brewed coffee but no one is ever seen drinking it? I propose that coffee was for something else. Something brown. Something deeply personal.

Finally, this theory explains why Home Improvement never had a reunion show. Tim‚Äôs secret got out. When the producers discovered a crude schematic for an industrial-grade, gas-powered colonic irrigation device labeled ‚ÄúTim‚Äôs Turbo Enemizer 3000,‚Äù the project was quietly shelved, the actors scattered, and the legacy‚Ä¶ flushed.

In conclusion, while there is no direct evidence that Tim Taylor was a coffee enema enthusiast, the circumstantial and interpretive evidence suggests a compelling alternative reading of his character. Underneath the plaid and power tools, there may have been a man seeking ultimate internal optimization‚Äîone cup at a time. Whether it‚Äôs fan fiction, crackpot theory, or suppressed truth, one thing is certain:

Tim Taylor believed in two things: horsepower‚Ä¶ and colon power.",107,1751203107.0,JoeRogan,29,0.82,False

It‚Äôs been a wonderful opportunity to get healthier and I‚Äôve been able to keep up a pretty good routine.

I sleep well every day, I‚Äôm cooking regularly and I‚Äôve upped my veg/fruit intake, I take walks in nature and get at least 20 minutes of exercise daily, and I‚Äôve done some self work through journaling.

One of the things I noticed through journaling is that I‚Äôve gotten good at ‚Äúkeeping my shit together‚Äù by only doing things out of urgency (and considering everyone else‚Äôs needs and wants as urgent).

I haven‚Äôt done anything out of interest in so freaking long. I hadn‚Äôt realised how bored and dull I felt.

I‚Äôve read books and watched Netflix and tried knitting and embroidering but nothing really gripped me or gave me that dopamine rush. So my partner suggested I try gaming.

My partner is a big gamer and I‚Äôm more of a backseat gamer (I prefer watching other people play) but since I had the time I decided to give it a shot.

I played a couple point and click games that lasted no more than a couple of hours, and I thought they were alright. Then I decided to give stardew valley a chance, since it‚Äôs popular with many women.

The first couple sessions I was overwhelmed and frustrated because of the amount of information I was taking in. I tried to work through that discomfort that comes from learning as you go when you are a bit of a perfectionist.

But by the third session I had understood the big picture and got a strong hyper focus going. I completely lost track of time. When I finally was able to pull myself away I was very 
 freaked out.

While I was gaming it was like nothing else mattered like the game. I let the routine go, I ordered food instead of cooking, I felt angry at the fact that my in laws were coming later and therefore I needed to pull myself together to do chores. I didn‚Äôt care about exercising and I got irritated by my partner.

It was like asking for coffee and getting cocaine, and my entire nervous system was shaken and screaming at me that I was in danger, that I was going to ruin everything I‚Äôve built for no reason, and that I couldn‚Äôt be trusted to make decisions.

When I was a kid I learned to restrict what I like to help mask socially and because I couldn‚Äôt do moderation. I‚Äôm sure other people with shitty childhoods also feel like everything they like is inherently stupid and shameful. But whenever I‚Äôve allowed myself to let go of control (with a book or a TV show), it‚Äôs been something that I‚Äôd be able to finish within a couple of days of binging. This video game felt like something huge that would swallow me whole without any boundaries for me to hold on to. 

I had a pretty extreme panic reaction to the hyper stimulation and I kinda feel like I am anti video game now? I‚Äôm refusing to touch steam again much to my partner‚Äôs dismay. I exercised and did some meditation to try and bring me back to my normal state but it seems like it triggered something in me and I‚Äôm trying to keep the negative thoughts at bay so they don‚Äôt spiral into general negativity like when I was depressed.

I guess I just wanted to write this down to process it a bit. I feel really anti-video games now and low key blame my partner‚Äôs video game habit on why he (who is also adhd) can‚Äôt seem to commit to healthier habits. But at the same time having hobbies like gaming keeps him fulfilled, which is the thing I was lacking in the first place. And being anti-videogame sounds like a fear-based overreaction.

I‚Äôm embarrassed about the whole thing and have lot of conflicting feelings but I‚Äôm wondering if any other ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùhigh performing‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù adhd ladies can relate?  Do you feel like you‚Äôve been able to accomplish everything you have by downprioritising interests that aren‚Äôt essential to survival?

Also I know im being judgemental of video games, but if you feel like I‚Äôm judging you remember: freaking stardew valley gave me a panic attack - i am a ridiculous person.",3,1751202843.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

We were incredibly close for the first few years but drifted apart during final year of uni. Since then, I've been the one mainly initiating contact, and when I had my daughter 2.5 years ago, she was excited but never visited despite a few invitations.

Recently she reached out with a random story, and I took the chance to say I missed her and wanted to reconnect. She responded enthusiastically the same day, saying she'd been thinking about me too and wanted to ""meet my little family and know me as an adult."" When I suggested planning a coffee to catch up, she never replied - it's been two weeks now, though she's still active on social media and views my stories.

I'm confused about whether she's genuinely busy (I know I can be a terrible texter as a mum), overwhelmed by the prospect of reconnecting, or just said yes out of politeness. I really want to rebuild our friendship but feel stuck in limbo. Should I reach out again in a couple weeks with a no-pressure message, or take her silence as a sign to let it go? Would you expect a response by now, or could she just be busy?",1,1751202592.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Night Terrors (Or - Jane‚Äôs Warning)

December 28, 2025
I am writing this journal to keep better track of my majorly dysfunctional brain. I have recently bought a very nice apartment, so that will be my first entry in my journal. With my doctor now pleased, my name is Johnathan Hansen, and about four months back, I finally decided to give in and rent an apartment (it took about four months for me to actually fulfill my decision, though, sorry parents)and to finally make something of myself. I had saved, hopefully, enough money to rent an apartment for a good time from working at a construction company for 3 years. (I‚Äôm 24, went to college for three years, and then got a construction job after that.) I was living with my parents and wanted to finally give them peace. I eventually decided I could pay rent off that money for a decent amount of time. Rent was about $400 a month, and for the space that I got, it was a steal. Because I was raised in California, where a million dollars gets you a shack outside of a much nicer mansion (which costs your entire family tree‚Äôs life savings), an apartment costing 400 a month was something you could only experience while inebriated. With the cost in mind, I fully expected a scam. But for 400? Worth it, even all the way out right by Anchorage, Alaska. Anyways, it was a small apartment. A white, two-bed-one-bath, modern and sleek. Now that I write this, I realize it wasn‚Äôt actually that small. The layout was bottle-shaped, with the front door leading to a narrow hallway with both bedrooms to each side and a bathroom directly to the left of the front door. The hallway concluded with an average-sized living room space.  I had been warned by  Jane, an old tenant of my new home, that her sleep was odd, interrupted, and confusing. I gave very little thought to this at the time, shrugging it off as a problem exclusive to her. This, however much I had ignored it, along with the lack of other people around, led to extreme unease. Surely a cheap, nice apartment complex would have people, right? That was the first thing. As I pulled up, I opened the door to the main building and began to feel nervous. This place was nice. Very nice. The parking lot was also strangely empty, which didn‚Äôt really have any effect on me until I entered the building. As I entered, I noted the size of the room almost immediately. The room was marginally bigger on the inside. Not non-Euclidean, just an interesting style of architecture. I also noticed the peculiar look of the desk clerk. He looked entirely depleted of energy. I mean full-on insomnia. He had a name tag with an overly joyful, small saying and ‚ÄúSergei‚Äù written in extremely shaky handwriting. He was sturdily built. Not athletic, but strong and not at all unhealthy (Other than the obvious lack of sleep). He had black hair in something similar to a comb-over, with a very droopy face and stern, sharp features. His eyes had a distance to them. Everything about him was normal, from his Nike shoes to his red suit. But his eyes. Their magenta haze, just showing a disconsolate euphoria. The unease already existing in my stomach had escalated much further.  His voice was broken, as if he hadn‚Äôt had anything to drink in ages. ‚ÄúSir, I need to see your apartment key to access the lounge.‚Äù I had forgotten where I was and clumsily tried to look in my backpack for a key. I told him I didn‚Äôt have one yet and needed one to access my apartment. For a little bit of context, the room was extremely nice. Extremely luxurious and modern, with furniture you would expect a heedless millionaire to buy. I thought to myself that maybe they were running a business on the side, because no one could afford this on $400 a month, but I hadn‚Äôt read anything or heard anything about it. ‚ÄúSorry, I don‚Äôt have my key yet. Are you the guy I need to get it from? Or do I need to go somewhere else?‚Äù The man took a second to respond, unblinking, with eyes locked slightly above my head and to my left, but his face showed nothing. After a long moment, he replied, ‚ÄúI can do it. I just need to verify that you own an apartment. First-last name and middle initial.‚Äù I gave it to them. His voice and eyes still lending to my stomach‚Äôs state of disarray. He told me how to get to my apartment and gave me my key. As I began walking to my new home, I noticed something out of place. A symbol was inscribed into a tree, a flower with white and yellow dye in it. I remember it as a lotus flower because my girlfriend loved them. It was very shakily drawn, with shocking detail, despite the extremely shaky drawings.. It did make me laugh a little bit. Something that seemed almost as if it was created by a child in a place so luxurious and nearly ominous as here. The rest of the walk was boring. It was maybe a 300-yard walk in a densely wooded area from the main lobby to the apartments, but it seemed to take forever just to get halfway. At the halfway point, the only interesting part of the walk appeared. It was one average-sized tree, the bark peeling away from the cold winter‚Äôs vicious teeth, gnawing slowly at it. But what interested me the most was the rope hanging from the top. It was the type of knot a climber would use on a large rock face. It was only about a three-foot-long rope, which confused me because the tree was only 16 or 17 feet tall, and the rope was at the very top of it. I wrote it off and continued walking. The snow just seemed to keep getting taller and deeper, ensnaring my boots more and more the further I trekked down the untouched trail. 
Once I arrived at the apartment (A standalone building, not dislike a cabin), I took the key Sergei had given me out of my now snow-laden pockets, and opened the door. The first thing that hit my senses was the cold. It wasn‚Äôt the cold of the outside; it was like someone had put ice in front of a fan and then blown it directly into my face.  Once I wandered deeper into the house, I realized it didn‚Äôt exactly match what the listing had shown. It had more windows than what was listed and was much more spacious. The bathroom had a circle etched into the floor, maybe six feet wide and maybe 1-2 inches deep, right in front of the bathtub, which was what you‚Äôd expect from a royal family or the white house. Marble and covered in gold outlines. The room itself was black marble with white accents, and it had a very solemn feel to it. The hallway was about the width I had expected, maybe 6 feet wide, with the ceiling about 8 feet tall. As I walked into the living room, I noted that the ceiling increased in height by a moderate amount. It was maybe 12 feet high, much larger than I had expected. The ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù was just an oven below a microwave next to a sink, all at about 90 degrees from an island. Once again, I felt slightly suspicious of the cost, which was almost too good to be true. The furniture was, however, quite modest. Middle class, not higher or lower. There were so many paintings. Almost immediately after seeing the photos, I knew I had to throw almost all of them away. They creeped the shit out of me. It was artistic depictions of gore. Nothing serious, just a king stabbing a jester or a snake eating a gazelle. One stood out, though, because it wasn't violent at all. It was a beautiful rendition of a lotus flower, with intricate curves of the petals and extraordinarily vibrant and ornate colors. Very out of place among the other hideous paintings. Once I got there, the chimney was already burning, and I assumed it was done by a janitor or just a caretaker of the unused apartments. 
December 29, 2025
Last night sucked. I went to sleep at around 11:30 (I write as a pastime and usually stay up late doing requests from friends and family). At some point in the night, I started dreaming. I was lying in my bed, the new one in the apartment, and I heard knocking. Not light tapping on the door, but almost aggressive banging and rapping at windows and walls. A symphonic cacophony of raps, taps, pounds, knocks, every possible noise that could be created from hitting the walls. I was trapped in my bed, incapable of moving anything but my eyes. I had never had any history of sleep paralysis before this and was quite horrified. It just felt so real, but I knew it couldn‚Äôt be. I knew it was just a dream, but it felt so much more surreal than all of the other sleep paralysis events that had been described to me by my friend who suffered from it. As I remembered all of this, the knocking stopped, and I felt a freezing chill coming from my room‚Äôs doorway. Then, with a harsh and shaking thud, the air stopped flowing into my room. I saw colossal, charred, black fingers wrapped around the doorway. The digits were easily a foot long each, but shriveled and of an abyssal black hue. The second they had firmly grasped the door, I gained the ability to move again, and shut my eyes so tight I thought I was going to pull a muscle in my eyelids. When I opened them, it was bright in my room, sunlight gleaming through the open window of my room. It was impossibly cold, so I lit a flame in the chimney and closed all of the windows. For such a nice home, you‚Äôd expect heating, but no. Just a chimney. Every window was open, and I thought I had forgotten to close them after opening them at some point in the night. After that event, I started to think of my girlfriend. I would never admit it to anyone, but that night horrified me. I wanted someone to live with me in the apartment, and I could ask Rose to live with me. I wouldn‚Äôt tell her it was because of something that happened to me, of course. She had been looking for a place to live and was living in her parents' house, kinda like me. And since we had only been dating for 4 months, it was not on my mind to invite her to live with me. The previous night made the decision pop into my head, though. Her name was Rose (Her dad is a MAJOR Titanic fan; I am surprised her brother wasn‚Äôt named Jack or something), and she was great. She is about 5‚Äô1‚Äô‚Äô, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone‚Äôs eyes before. I met her on my break while working on, coincidentally, an apartment complex. I was sitting on a bench, eating a sandwich of just bread and turkey. She sat on the other side of the bench and asked me if that was all I had to eat. I told her yes, and she withdrew a sandwich from a nice-looking purse. The sandwich was considerably better than the one I had made (I ignored the fact that she randomly had a sandwich in her bag; she has her quirks). I ate it heartily, and as I got up to go back to work, she asked for my number. We hit it off from there and went on a few dates. I texted her, offering her a stay at the apartment, and she accepted relatively quickly. This wasn‚Äôt exactly shocking, as she had been looking for a way to get closer to me recently. After waiting for a few hours for her to pack her stuff (She didn‚Äôt like her parents, so she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible), I started walking back to the main lobby. 
As I exited my house, I was incredibly shocked to realize that there were dozens of footsteps in the snow, entirely encompassing my cabin, and just circling, again and again and again. I followed one trail specifically so I could get an idea of the rest of them. It made 4 laps around my apartment and stopped directly in front of the window of my bedroom. The window was also directly over my bed, so whoever or whatever made those footsteps was staring at me in my sleep. I knew it couldn‚Äôt be the same as the knocking from the night. I knew it was intense and surreal, but it wasn‚Äôt real life. I have always had some form of dreaming, but rarely nightmares. And when I did, never nearly that bad, but I knew what one was supposed to be like. Yes, it was weird, but I was probably just overreacting. I got rid of the footsteps and jogged back to the main lobby. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off about the woods. Nothing really happened; it was a boring jog, but it just felt wrong. When I arrived, Rose still hadn‚Äôt arrived, and I waited in the slightly off-putting lobby. Sergei was there, just as terrible-looking as before. I wondered how long it had been since he last slept. 
Rose arrived maybe 20 minutes after I did to the main lobby, luggage (Much more than I brought) on a trolley, packed mostly to the brim. Her hair was very nicely done; either she changed her hairdo or put more effort into this than our previous dates. She was wearing white and gold plaid pajamas and a red hoodie. Rose was completely ignorant of my being there and seemed quite put off by Sergei‚Äôs appearance. I doubted I would ever get used to it, but that wasn‚Äôt important. She noticed me about a minute after she walked in, mostly due to the fact that I tapped her on the shoulder to even get her attention. She was happy to see me and spun around so fast her arm hit me on the shoulder. She said she was sorry and then hugged me for a good 10 seconds. She told Sergei she was with me, and after I confirmed that, he let her through. He asked me why I hadn‚Äôt brought her the first day, and I told him I hadn‚Äôt thought about it. ‚ÄúAnything happen during the night? Unruly neighbors? Wildlife in the area give you a spook?‚Äù I told him nothing happened, just thought about it this morning. I guess he didn‚Äôt have the energy to care anymore, so he just drank something out of a tonic and went back to his computer. 
I showed Rose the way to our cabin (as I will now call it). She asked about the inscription in the trees, and I told her that I didn‚Äôt know. I assumed it was just the logo of the company that owned the housing, but I honestly had no clue. I didn‚Äôt know much about the place other than it being cheap and nice at the same time. I opened the door, and once again, the wind's cold fingers brushed past me, nipping at my already cold ears and nose. The inside was just as cold as the first time, and all the windows were open. It didn‚Äôt appear anything had been taken, but there were puddles in a track to my room leading to my closet. I quickly said I had to clean the place up a little bit and shut the door behind me as I entered my room. I ran to the closet and flung it open, but found nothing but my clothes and a puddle on the floor. I somehow managed to ignore this and told Rose it was just me spilling water on my way to the coffee machine (She believed me, but the sink and coffee machine are right next to each other). She commented on the paintings, the distraught expression of the bard, or the ignoble eyes of the serpent. I told her I would burn the damn things but she told me to just put them in storage or the owners would get mad. I conceded and did as she said. She was right, and the place had given me the chills ever since I got here.

That night was rather peaceful. She decided to sleep in the other room but told me she would sleep with me eventually. She had previously had an extremely abusive relationship, where as soon as she slept in the same bed as her ex, he took advantage of her and even hurt her. That wretch was in prison now, but that didn‚Äôt change what he did. I told her I understood, and told her to just take her time. I slept peacefully, and to my knowledge, so did she. I woke up to the smell of cinnamon and brown sugar, and when I walked to the kitchen, I saw her making French toast. I asked her when she woke up, and she responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know. I just kinda realized I was making breakfast.‚Äù I thought it odd, but we both quickly wrote it off. I had ordered locks for the windows so that they couldn‚Äôt be opened from the outside, and installed them later that morning. While installing the locks on the windows that faced the forested area opposite the main lobby, I noticed what appeared to be a man in a very opulent gray suit and black, fingerless gloves. He stood entirely statically, not a single twitch of a muscle. He was maybe 200 feet out, but I could not make out a single feature of his face. He stood in a tall brush, but not tall enough to cover his face. It just seemed as if his features were distorted but not present. Like a Mr. Potato made out of paint. I chose not to tell Rose, as it would do nothing but scare her. I finished installing the rest of the locks as fast as I could and proceeded to call the front desk. 
It wasn‚Äôt Sergei‚Äôs voice, but instead a very bubbly voice of a woman. Almost entirely opposite of Sergei‚Äôs raspy and depressed voice. ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù She asked as if she were a therapist trying to solve my problems. ‚ÄúI saw a man in the woods. He was just staring at my house from the forest, and I‚Äôm worried for my safety. Is there any security, or do I call the cops?‚Äù She said nothing, the static of the landline growing louder, its angry voice roaring in my ears with growing intensity. She broke the silence, returning the static to a dull hum. ‚ÄúHe is not a concern to you. We do have security, and they have been warned. Is he still there now?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt checked, but as I did, he was right up against the window, his fingers severely frostbitten and pressed up against the glass. His face didn‚Äôt make sense; there wasn‚Äôt a face, there weren‚Äôt any features, but there was something. He DID have a face, I just couldn‚Äôt tell what was what, there was no contour, no edges, no curves, just color that gave way to more color, color giving the perception of depth. Like a great artist who didn‚Äôt know how to shade. It was wrong. Luckily, Rose was out shopping and didn‚Äôt see the man. As soon as I poked my head out of my room and saw him, he ran off into the woods faster than I could‚Äôve possibly expected. I quickly told the receptionist what I had just seen, and she replied rather quickly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir, but there is no man in a purple suit running around looking into windows. You may be hallucinating, but we have fencing and security near the area. I have told security, but you have nothing to worry about.‚Äù I reluctantly told her thank you, and put the drapes down on the windows. The room was much dimmer, but I didn‚Äôt mind. The thing that stuck with me was the fact that I never mentioned he was wearing a suit, especially not the fact that it was purple. 
January 2, 2025
When Rose got back with the groceries, she asked why the curtains were down. I told her I had a headache, and the sun reflecting off the snow caused it to worsen. This wasn‚Äôt a full lie; I did have a headache by this point, and I didn‚Äôt want to scare Rose on the second day here. That night, she actually decided to lie next to me on my bed for a while. She didn‚Äôt sleep next to me, but I saw this as a major improvement. Things chilled out for the next week or two, and nothing strange or creepy occurred at all during that time. About a week in, Rose started sleeping next to me. I understood how hard it was for her to trust someone this much, so I felt so appreciated that I was the someone she could trust. 

January 17, 2025
It started on Friday. First, it felt like every ad I got on TV was about being an organ donor, and I actually paid for no ads on most of my streaming services because of this. Next came the sleepwalking. I had set up cameras outside the cabin because of the mishap with the man. They were motion detecting and only turned on when there was movement. It was usually just deer walking by my house, or on one special occasion, an elk. One night, the motion sensors were set off by none other than me. I had gotten up and walked outside, barefoot, in just pajama pants. I stood outside, deadpan into the woods, Unmoving and unblinking for three straight minutes, and then I calmly walked back inside and went back to sleep. I wasn‚Äôt at all cold during this time and don‚Äôt remember any of it. All I remember was getting up in the middle of the night to piss. This happened two more times, and then I started deadbolting the door at night so that the unconscious me couldn‚Äôt go outside at night. The reason wasn‚Äôt just so I didn‚Äôt go out, but because I heard a voice without any discernible origin the last night I went out. It was indiscernible, but it was saying something.
January 20, 2025
Rose started experiencing nightmares. From what she told me, they weren‚Äôt serious, just her watching TV and seeing the people in the paintings that were magically back on the wall frolicking, and stuff like that. At least it wasn‚Äôt the dream of me cheating on her (It happened once, and I hope she never has that dream again - nightmare fuel). She bought some striplights and other forms of lighting and less modern furniture to make the extremely luxurious ‚ÄúCabin‚Äù seem more like a real cabin. We saw the northern lights one day; so bright and beautiful, so vibrant and close I thought I could reach out and touch them. I was overwhelmed with joy, realizing life was pretty nice. No parents to tell you what to do, a place of your own, and a loving girlfriend; it was nice. I had gotten a job in the area, and so had Rose. We had more than enough of an income stream and cheap enough housing to live a relatively lavish lifestyle. But it just didn‚Äôt feel right. It felt too perfect. The whole 3 weeks I had lived here, I had only seen around 10 other people. There were also the nightmares, and the man that I knew was real, that I knew I didn‚Äôt hallucinate. Something was going on. I just didn‚Äôt know. 
January 21, 2025
The worst thing yet happened. I had another sleep paralysis event. This time, Rose was with me. I got ready for the worst, but nothing happened. I couldn‚Äôt move anything but my eyes, and I was confused when no horrors of the abyssal woods came to haunt my waking dreams. And then, all of a sudden, every single window of the house started rattling. The same symphonic cacophony of rapping, tapping, knocking, and every noise you could get from knocking on a wall. This time, there were the windows. They were being rattled and shaken so aggressively and so quickly that some of the locks were starting to be unscrewed from the window sills. Rose‚Äôs expression changed. She was still asleep; she just started making a disgusted face, as if she were looking at putrescent mounds, or something of equal disgust. Suddenly, the knocking stopped, and through the mirror on the wall, I could see the window right above my bed. Through it, I saw vile creatures. Humanoids, mouths all curled up into an impossible smile, the mouth‚Äôs gaping open so wide and so deep the head could not possibly have fit the unfathomable depths of the dark grey tissue that was their mouth. They had innumerable extremely long and sharp teeth, along with two fangs, very similar to snakes. The smile seemed to continue for almost the entire circumference of their head, barely not meeting at the back. The flesh of the creatures was a dark gray, with the smallest points frost-bitten to the point of ash, crinkling away at the slightest wind. There were so many, all staring in the window, right at Rose. Their fully bloodshot eyes with yellow pupils and a disgusting bile covering the rest of the putrid aberration only conceivable as their face.. They were quite slender, their neck barely wider than my wrist. All of them were completely unmoving, just staring. Then, they looked in the direction of the front door as I heard the same banging sound, and the sound of the door being slammed open, then shut. Then there was nothing, the moonlight faded away entirely, giving way to sunlight, the creatures vanishing, whatever came into the house gone, the entire time, I knew I was awake. The cameras caught motion, but they were all just black screens. None of them caught anything.
As soon as I woke up, I looked to Rose. She wasn‚Äôt sleeping. I quickly jumped out of my bed, rushing to the living room. She was in the kitchen, cooking eggs. ‚ÄúHey, honey, you‚Äôre awake! It‚Äôs almost 1:00, I was starting to get worried!‚Äù I responded, in an attempt to calm my own nerves, ‚ÄúJust tired, I guess. How‚Äôd you sleep?‚Äù She put some eggs onto a plate before responding, ‚ÄúIt was pretty good. I had a nightmare, though, and it was actually about you.‚Äù She then explained to me the nightmare, which kind of frightened me. As a kid, I always wanted to dream with my friends, so I could spend more time with them. But when the dream is actually a nightmare, and it terrifies your girlfriend? I told her I had an almost identical nightmare, and then I heard a knock at the door.
January 22, 2025
The person knocking was a man in a very nice black suit with a tie with the same lotus depiction as in my house. He had some aspect of the haziness and distance to his eyes as Sergei did, but he still seemed of good health and calm mind. His voice was that of a diffident salesman, seeming a little hesitant to speak with me. After gaining his composure, he asked to speak to me in private. He was selling me a heater and told me he was speaking in private because he recognized Rose as one of the higher-ups at the company he works for. I had never actually asked about Rose‚Äôs job, but if she sold heaters, I guess that would have been a waste of my time. He told me the space heater was gas-powered and that the apartment complex had a line running under all of the cabins, and that he could hook the heater up quite easily, and that it would just take some time. I asked for the price, and he said the apartment complex would pay 40% of it, and when the original price was only 200, I had to buy it. The cabin was cold enough as it was, and something that could heat the entire place easily for 120$ was worth it. I told him I was interested and bought it. I had to pay early, so I paid him just before we left. I gave him cash, which I was surprised he accepted. 
He left and came back in a very nice pickup truck about two hours later, dressed less fashionably than before, in a normal, grey coat, and beige, denim pants, with gloves and a hat. He and I pulled the heater out of the back of the truck, setting it on the ground just below my window. I had noticed there weren‚Äôt tracks this time, so I was consoled a little more into recognizing that experience as a dream. It was also at this point that I realized I didn‚Äôt know his name. I asked him, and he said he wasn‚Äôt comfortable with giving his name out, but said he worked for a company called Priapus. I thought it odd that a salesman, whose goal is to be personable enough to sell something to a stranger, wasn‚Äôt comfortable with giving out their name, but forgive and forget. I was no longer needed, so I went inside to spend some time with Rose. It was already about 7 PM at this point, and that was around the time I watched TV with Rose. I‚Äôm a major Invincible fan, and she had never seen it, so we had been watching that lately. The man left about two hours later, having hooked up the heater to the ventilation of the extremely modern little cabin in the woods.
January 23, 2025
Rose just got home from a doctor's appointment, and now we know she needs some type of sleep mask. Unbeknownst to me, Rose has had sleep issues for a while now. I had known about her going to the doctor's appointment, but was told it was just a routine checkup. I guess it could be, but I didn‚Äôt remember her sleep being bad (other than the nightmares) or having problems when she woke up. But I guess if the doctor thought it necessary, I would have to agree. The heater does its job well, although the cabin seems just the smallest amount foggy, just barely noticeable even if you‚Äôre looking as intently as possible. It didn‚Äôt bother me at all, and Rose didn‚Äôt seem to notice. It helped that the fog was only really there at night as well. No more frozen entrances to the abode. 
January 26, 2025
Feels like forever since I touched this notebook, but I have so much to write about. I actually dedicated time today just to write. First off, Rose is pregnant. I only found out about this ~4 hours ago, and I can say I am pretty excited. I have always wanted kids, and now I can finally have one. Just hope it‚Äôs a boy. Secondly, I am getting suspicious. The rent is so incredibly cheap, the accommodations are so incredibly luxurious, yet there is almost no one here. Just recently, someone moved out. The crazy thing is, I never saw the moving truck. I am pretty sure I am one of the only people living here. There were only three other cabins with lights on last night, which I refuse to believe. Something has to be happening to give another source of income. I looked up the company that owns the place, and they do NOTHING except run the apartments. With all of the luxurious furniture, the discount to almost any new furniture I buy, they have to be running so deep in the red that not even Toys-R-Us could match the bankruptcy this place should be reaching. I know I should be worrying more about the kid and preparing for them, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something is going wrong. I‚Äôve been so tired lately, coffee barely affects me. That can‚Äôt be normal. It may just be the other job I picked up, but that is just another two hours to my day. I don‚Äôt even work at that worksite, I just oversee it. I should not be this tired, yet here I am, 7 PM, feeling like I‚Äôve pulled a full-nighter three times in a row. Rose seems completely normal, though. Maybe I just gave myself a placebo somehow. I‚Äôm not taking any new meds, but maybe the old ones have expired? Let me check. No. The meds are completely fine. I don‚Äôt know what is going on, but I‚Äôll figure it out. Away from those semantics, I also got a raise, a 30% pay increase. That is such a massive ascent, I am almost in the triple digits for my salary. That‚Äôs another thing. Until recently, I had been getting paid per hour per job. Now, I have a salary (Which up until recently was my average income from the past two years) that had only existed for 2 weeks, and it just gained $21,000? My luck is only achievable by divine intervention. Maybe god just really likes me? I don‚Äôt know anymore. I‚Äôll think about it until I write next. I still have one more thing to get off my chest, however. Rose has been acting a little distant lately. You‚Äôd think the pregnancy would make us closer, but she is less talkative than before, a little less cuddly. She is about 5‚Äô1, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone‚Äôs eyes before. She isn‚Äôt the strongest woman I‚Äôve ever seen, but she isn‚Äôt a pushover. Now that that‚Äôs done, I am going to go to sleep. I‚Äôll write more tomorrow.

The faceless guy came back, and so did the nightmares. Everything is so much worse now. I barely sleep at all, and when I do sleep, the nightmares make sure it doesn‚Äôt rest. The monsters get hungrier, more intent in their gazes, their gaping mouths screaming in a cacophonic melody, devoid of any soul or life, just husks made for nothing but a purpose. Every time I dream of them, their eyes get just a little bit hungrier, their smiles get a little darker, the endless abyss of their throats tries harder and harder to convince me into their gnashing maw. They seem stronger every time I see them, too. Their grip on the window getting just that little bit stronger, their gnashing teeth getting a little louder, their gazes scaring me more and more.

**What‚Äôs worse than checking your bank account on a Monday morning? Realizing you** ***meant*** **to budget this month but never did.** You downloaded three apps, watched a TikTok about zero-based budgeting, maybe even opened an old Excel file-and still ended up Venmo-ing your friend for pizza with your ‚Äúemergency‚Äù savings.

Budgeting is one of those things we *swear* we‚Äôll get right after payday. But in 2025, the options are overwhelming: should you trust your money to budgeting apps like Monarch, YNAB, or Copilot? Or go full DIY and run your finances from a Google Sheet?

Spoiler: both methods work-*if you actually use them*. But they‚Äôre built differently, and depending on how your brain works (and your paycheck hits), one will make your financial life way easier than the other.

Let‚Äôs break down what really sets them apart-and how to figure out which budgeting method actually works for *your* money in 2025.

# Key Differences Between Budgeting Apps and Spreadsheets

**What‚Äôs the core difference between budgeting apps and spreadsheets?**

Think of it like this: budgeting apps are the Uber of personal finance-plug in your destination (a savings goal, debt payoff, whatever), and it auto-navigates for you. Spreadsheets are like building the car yourself. Powerful? Yes. But you have to know what you‚Äôre doing.

* **Budgeting apps** like YNAB or Monarch are pre-built systems designed to automate, track, and visualize your spending.  
* **Spreadsheets** (think Google Sheets or Excel) are blank canvases where you build your own formulas, categories, and systems from scratch.  

Apps are opinionated-they tell you *how* to budget. Spreadsheets are flexible-they let *you* decide the rules.

Both can be smart. But how you like to interact with your money will make or break your experience.

**Which offers more accurate budget tracking in real time?**

If your main pain point is ‚Äúwhere tf did my paycheck go,‚Äù then **budgeting apps win this round.** Most modern apps sync directly with your bank accounts, credit cards, even BNPL tools like Klarna or Affirm. That means you get:

* Automatic transaction imports (no typing amounts manually)  
* Real-time category updates (see how much you‚Äôve actually spent on food delivery this week)  
* Notifications when you overspend or hit a savings milestone  

Spreadsheets, by default, don‚Äôt talk to your bank. You‚Äôll either need to input transactions manually or use a third-party tool like Tiller Money to sync bank feeds. For most users? That‚Äôs friction-and friction means drop-off.

Apps streamline it. Spreadsheets? They require diligence.

**Is manual budgeting in spreadsheets still effective in 2025?**

Absolutely-but it‚Äôs *not* for everyone.

Some people swear by their spreadsheets because typing every transaction forces them to be intentional. They *feel* their spending more. If you‚Äôre the type who wants to know where every dollar goes, and you find peace in control, spreadsheets can be deeply effective.

But manual input is time-consuming. It requires consistency. And in 2025, with so many distractions (hello, five-minute delivery apps), consistency is a tall order.

Here‚Äôs the trade-off:

* **Manual = more control**  
* **Automation = more consistency** Pick your pain.  

**How automation in budgeting apps compares to spreadsheet formulas**

Spreadsheet lovers will say, ‚ÄúBut I *can* automate with formulas.‚Äù That‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ to a point. You can create dropdown categories, SUMIF rules, even conditional formatting to highlight overspending. But it still requires setup, debugging, and knowing how to use functions.

Budgeting apps take that friction away. They already have automation baked in:

* Categorizing your expenses with AI tagging  
* Rolling over unused budget amounts month to month  
* Auto-adjusting your future budgets based on spending patterns  

In other words, **budgeting apps bring plug-and-play automation**, while spreadsheets require build-it-yourself logic.

If your goal is ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù with reminders and visuals, apps win. If you love control, logic, and customization? Spreadsheets still slap.

**Book insight:** In *""Atomic Habits""* by James Clear (Chapter 4), he writes:

‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù Apps give you ready-made systems. Spreadsheets require you to build them. Pick what sets *you* up to win consistently.

# Pros and Cons of Using Budgeting Apps

**What are the main advantages of budgeting apps in 2025?**

In 2025, budgeting apps aren‚Äôt just apps-they‚Äôre mini financial coaches in your pocket.

Most of them connect directly to your bank accounts and credit cards, so you can finally stop playing financial detective every time you wonder where your money went. The best ones (like Copilot, YNAB, or Monarch) pull in your transactions in real time, auto-categorize them, and show you-visually-how you‚Äôre trending for the month.

There‚Äôs a weird emotional shift that happens when you *see* you‚Äôve already hit 87% of your ‚ÄúFun‚Äù category and it‚Äôs only the 18th. You actually hesitate before placing another coffee order or opening the Zara app at 1am. It‚Äôs not just math. It‚Äôs mindfulness.

Budgeting apps are also great at nudging behavior. Copilot, for instance, uses AI to flag unusual charges and gives you instant spending insights. Monarch lets you map out net worth goals with your partner. YNAB literally forces you to ‚Äúgive every dollar a job,‚Äù which can be annoying at first-but it builds discipline fast.

What makes budgeting apps powerful in 2025 is how little you have to do after setup. Once you link your accounts, the system does 80% of the heavy lifting. It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôve tried budgeting ten times but never stuck with it. Apps make you stickier.

**Are budgeting apps more beginner-friendly than spreadsheets?**

For most people? Yes-and it's not even close.

Spreadsheets assume you already understand how to budget. Budgeting apps walk you through the why, the how, and the what-if scenarios. Many have guided onboarding, pre-set categories, and even weekly reports that explain what you‚Äôre doing well and where you‚Äôre off track.

If you‚Äôre new to managing money, this structure is huge. It‚Äôs one thing to track your spending; it‚Äôs another to actually understand it. Good apps don‚Äôt just show you numbers-they translate them into action.

And they do it without making you feel stupid. That‚Äôs what makes them beginner-friendly in a way most spreadsheets simply aren‚Äôt.

**What limitations do budgeting apps have compared to spreadsheets?**

Apps are great until they don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù your money.

Let‚Äôs say you do freelance work with wildly inconsistent income. Or you have irregular bills, family support payments, or side hustle revenue coming in through four different apps. Budgeting apps sometimes struggle with nuance like that.

They‚Äôre built around the *average* user-someone with two or three accounts, a predictable paycheck, and simple goals. If your money life is messier or needs hyper-specific rules, apps can feel limiting. You can‚Äôt always customize categories the way you want, or change how calculations are done behind the scenes.

Also: if the app‚Äôs interface doesn‚Äôt vibe with how your brain processes data, it can make you less likely to use it-even if it‚Äôs objectively ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù

And yes, most good budgeting apps cost money. That alone turns off some spreadsheet loyalists.

**How secure are modern budgeting apps with personal financial data?**

This is a big one in 2025-and the short answer is: **way more secure than they used to be.**

Thanks to growing data privacy regulations like the American Data Privacy Protection Act and Europe‚Äôs GDPR equivalents, budgeting apps now have to meet strict security standards. Most top apps use **256-bit encryption**, **multi-factor authentication**, and **read-only API access** to your bank accounts. That means they can see your balances and transactions, but they *can‚Äôt* move money or make changes.

Still, not all apps are created equal. Some have better track records with transparency and data handling than others. Monarch, for example, has zero ads, doesn‚Äôt sell your data, and offers encrypted sync across devices. Others may still collect anonymized behavioral data for improving their algorithms-which might be a dealbreaker for privacy-conscious users.

Before you connect your accounts, always read the app‚Äôs security FAQ and check how it makes money. If it's free, remember: **you‚Äôre probably the product.**

**Book insight:** In *‚ÄúYour Money or Your Life‚Äù* by Vicki Robin (Chapter 6), she says:

‚ÄúMoney is something we choose to trade our life energy for.‚Äù Budgeting apps are tools that can help protect that energy-but only if you trust where that data is going.

# Pros and Cons of Using Spreadsheets for Budgeting

**Why do some users still prefer Excel or Google Sheets for budgeting?**

Here‚Äôs the thing-spreadsheets are still undefeated when it comes to full creative control.

For some people, budgeting isn‚Äôt just about tracking-it‚Äôs a ritual. Sitting down with a spreadsheet, color-coding categories, typing in each expense manually-it gives structure to the chaos. It‚Äôs like journaling, but for your bank account.

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs naturally organized or detail-obsessed, a spreadsheet can feel more empowering than any app. You‚Äôre not limited by someone else‚Äôs layout or assumptions. You get to decide how your categories work, what rules apply, and which formulas make sense for *your* life.

And because you built the system yourself, you actually trust it more.

There‚Äôs also no risk of ‚Äúfeature fatigue.‚Äù No pop-ups, notifications, or weekly reports begging for attention. Just your numbers, exactly how you want them.

**Are spreadsheets better for customizable and complex budgets?**

Without a doubt. This is where spreadsheets shine.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre managing:

* A freelance income that varies wildly month to month  
* A debt snowball payoff plan across four different credit cards  
* Joint household expenses with your partner, plus personal goals  
* Yearly tax estimates, side hustle reinvestments, and sinking funds  

Most apps would struggle to capture all of that complexity in one place. But with spreadsheets, you can build as many tabs, layers, and formulas as you want. Conditional formatting? Sure. Cash flow forecasts with assumptions baked in? Go for it. Charts that update dynamically when your inputs change? Easy.

For financial nerds, spreadsheets are a playground. You can model scenarios, simulate future growth, or visualize your net worth trajectory without limits.

Apps make budgeting easier. Spreadsheets make it deeper.

**Do spreadsheets give you more control over your financial plan?**

Totally-and for some people, control equals peace.

With an app, you‚Äôre trusting a system you didn‚Äôt create. That‚Äôs fine until it mislabels a transaction or glitches mid-month. In a spreadsheet, *you* enter the data, *you* decide how it‚Äôs calculated, and nothing happens unless you make it happen.

That level of precision is especially valuable if you‚Äôre:

* Doing zero-based budgeting  
* Managing multiple financial identities (personal, business, side hustle)  
* Trying to forecast months ahead with detailed assumptions  

It‚Äôs not just about knowing where your money is-it‚Äôs about *designing* the plan on your terms.

But control has a cost: time. You‚Äôll spend more hours setting it up, debugging errors, and manually inputting expenses. You have to enjoy the process, or at least value the clarity it gives you.

**Can spreadsheets compete with budgeting app features in 2025?**

Yes-and no.

In raw capability? Spreadsheets can technically do everything apps do (and more). But it depends on how skilled you are with formulas, formatting, and data validation.

Most people aren‚Äôt creating pivot tables to track spending trends. And let‚Äôs be real: no one wants to manually copy-paste 36 months of bank data just to see how their grocery spending changed during inflation waves.

Budgeting apps win on speed, ease, and automation. But spreadsheets win on flexibility and fidelity.

In 2025, it‚Äôs less about which is *better*\-it‚Äôs about what fits your lifestyle, tech comfort, and money habits.

**Book insight:** In *‚ÄúI Will Teach You to Be Rich‚Äù* by Ramit Sethi (Chapter 3), he says:

‚ÄúThe best system is the one you actually stick with.‚Äù If that‚Äôs a spreadsheet you lovingly update with lo-fi beats playing in the background-amazing. If it‚Äôs a sleek app that pings you to stay on track-also amazing. Your system should work for your real life, not your aspirational self.

# Cost Comparison: Are Budgeting Apps Worth Paying For?

**What are the ongoing costs of top budgeting apps like YNAB, Monarch, or Copilot?**

Budgeting apps have gotten slicker, smarter, and a lot more expensive since 2020.

Let‚Äôs talk numbers first:

* **You Need A Budget (YNAB)**: $14.99/month or $99/year  
* **Monarch Money**: $14.99/month or $99/year  
* **Copilot**: $13/month or $96/year  

If you‚Äôre comparing this to a $0 Google Sheet, that looks steep. But what you‚Äôre really paying for isn‚Äôt the app-it‚Äôs the friction they remove. Auto-syncing accounts, clean dashboards, AI-powered categorization, smart notifications, and collaborative budgeting tools (especially for couples)? That‚Äôs what the price buys you.

For people who‚Äôve tried to build a system themselves and burned out halfway through, paying for a polished, low-effort system is 100% worth it. If it helps you save $150/month by catching overspending or sticking to your goals? That‚Äôs a return-on-investment most spreadsheets won‚Äôt give you.

Still, the monthly fees stack up-especially if you‚Äôre already juggling subscriptions for everything from Netflix to Notion AI. So the real question becomes...

**How do free spreadsheets compare in long-term cost efficiency?**

From a money-out-of-pocket perspective, spreadsheets win by a landslide. No recurring costs. No freemium traps. No sneaky upsells. Just you and your formulas.

And here‚Äôs the underrated truth: some of the most financially disciplined people use spreadsheets **because** they‚Äôre free. It‚Äôs not just a money-saving tactic-it‚Äôs a values thing. They want full ownership of their finances without needing a paid platform in the middle.

Over the long run, if you have the discipline to stick with it, spreadsheets offer the highest cost efficiency. They‚Äôre especially great for people in early financial recovery (paying off debt, building savings from zero) where every dollar needs to be functional.

But that time commitment? It‚Äôs the hidden tax.

**Can premium budgeting apps justify their subscription fees?**

It depends on two things: **behavior change and savings impact**.

If a budgeting app helps you stick to a spending plan, say no to impulse buys, automate your savings, and track progress toward a big goal-then yes, it can absolutely justify the cost. Especially if you‚Äôve never been able to make a spreadsheet work consistently.

Most of us waste way more than $10/month on stuff we don‚Äôt even remember buying. If a $10‚Äì15 app shows you that and helps stop the bleed? It‚Äôs more than paying for itself.

The trick is to actually *use* the app. Passive tracking won‚Äôt cut it. The ROI kicks in when the app changes your behavior.

If you‚Äôve tried three budgeting apps and keep ghosting them after week two, the problem probably isn‚Äôt the price-it‚Äôs that the system doesn‚Äôt match your lifestyle. In that case, no app is worth it.

**Is budgeting with spreadsheets truly ""free"" when factoring in time and effort?**

Here‚Äôs where the illusion cracks.

Yes, spreadsheets are free in dollars. But they cost in time-and depending on your financial complexity, that time adds up. Manually entering transactions, updating balances, adjusting for unexpected expenses, cross-referencing bank statements‚Ä¶it‚Äôs work.

If you're spending two hours a week updating a spreadsheet, that‚Äôs eight hours a month. Would you rather spend $10/month for an app to do that for you? That‚Äôs your tradeoff.

Now if you *enjoy* that time-if it gives you clarity, control, or a dopamine hit from watching numbers line up-that‚Äôs different. But if it starts to feel like another to-do, it‚Äôs easy to fall off.

So is it ‚Äúfree‚Äù? Yes. But like all ‚Äúfree‚Äù things, the real cost is hidden in how much of *you* it consumes.

**Book insight:** In *‚ÄúThe Psychology of Money‚Äù* by Morgan Housel (Chapter 11), he writes:

‚ÄúWealth is what you don‚Äôt see. It‚Äôs the car not purchased. The clothes not bought. The software you don‚Äôt feel forced to upgrade.‚Äù Sometimes not spending is a flex. Other times, spending a little to keep your financial life sane is the smarter play.

# Choosing the Right Tool Based on Your Financial Needs

**Which is better for tracking variable income-apps or spreadsheets?**

If your paycheck looks different every month, welcome to the club-freelancers, gig workers, creators, and side hustlers make up nearly 40% of the workforce now (per McKinsey‚Äôs 2025 report).

In this world, fixed budgets break fast. That‚Äôs where spreadsheets often shine.

When you build your own budget in Google Sheets, you can map income scenarios: high-income months, dry spells, taxes owed, invoice lags. You can layer in buffers, set up cash flow charts, and forecast your runway with brutal clarity.

Budgeting apps, on the other hand, assume a level of predictability. Some-like YNAB-let you ‚Äúonly budget what you have,‚Äù which helps with cash discipline, but still doesn‚Äôt fully solve for income volatility unless you‚Äôre actively adjusting every week.

So if your income swings hard and you‚Äôre detail-oriented? Spreadsheets give you the edge. But if you‚Äôre overwhelmed and just want to make sure your rent‚Äôs covered and your groceries aren‚Äôt chaos? A good app can simplify your mental load fast.

**Do budgeting apps help build better habits faster than spreadsheets?**

Yes-and it‚Äôs not just about features. It‚Äôs about *feedback loops*.

Budgeting apps are great at showing cause and effect. You overspend on food delivery? You‚Äôll see it visually blow up a category. You hit a savings milestone? You get a confetti screen or a subtle dopamine hit.

These little interactions matter. They help you associate budgeting with progress, not punishment.

Spreadsheets don‚Äôt give you feedback unless you build it in. Which, let‚Äôs be honest, most people won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs easy to ignore a red cell in Excel. It‚Äôs harder to ignore a push notification from your budgeting app that says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre $82 over on lifestyle spending.‚Äù

If your goal is to actually *change* how you spend, not just track it, then apps typically get you there faster-because they‚Äôre designed to keep you engaged.

**Which tool is best for users managing shared or household budgets?**

Managing money solo is hard enough. Doing it with a partner, roommate, or even a sibling? Whole different game.

This is where most spreadsheets fall apart. Unless you‚Äôre both spreadsheet fluent, trying to co-manage one can turn into a version-control nightmare. Who edited what? Did someone delete a formula? Did we update the balance before or after rent cleared?

Budgeting apps like Monarch or Honeydue are built for shared money. They let each person connect their accounts, assign shared expenses, comment on goals, and see everything in one view-without sharing passwords or manually syncing updates.

Even apps like YNAB now allow shared access with roles, so couples can budget together without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes.

So if you‚Äôre budgeting with someone else and want fewer fights? Use an app. Unless you both genuinely *enjoy* building a shared spreadsheet, it‚Äôs not worth the headache.

**Should you use both a budgeting app and a spreadsheet together?**

This is the underrated power move no one talks about.

Apps are amazing for tracking and automating. Spreadsheets are amazing for planning and forecasting. Using them together? That‚Äôs when you level up.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* Use an app to *track real-time spending and trends*  
* Use a spreadsheet to *plan ahead, map big goals, and model scenarios*  

For example: Copilot shows you how your spending changed this month. Your spreadsheet helps you figure out what to do about it. Monarch tracks your net worth. Your spreadsheet breaks down your next-year savings strategy.

It‚Äôs not overkill if you keep it simple. Think of it like having both a fitness tracker and a meal prep plan. They serve different purposes, and together, they give you a full picture.

**Book insight:** In *‚ÄúDie With Zero‚Äù* by Bill Perkins (Chapter 2), he writes:

‚ÄúMaximizing your life means balancing your spending, saving, and experiences-consciously, not reactively.‚Äù Sometimes that means using tech to make life easier. Other times it means pausing, planning, and building it yourself. You don‚Äôt have to pick a side. You just need to pick what works.



# FAQ: Budgeting Apps vs Spreadsheets in 2025

# Which is better for beginners: budgeting apps or spreadsheets?

If you‚Äôre new to managing money, **budgeting apps are 10x easier to start with**.

They guide you through setup, link to your bank, show visual trends, and give you smart nudges. You don‚Äôt need to learn formulas, create tabs, or even think too hard about what to track-they do it for you.

Spreadsheets can work for beginners, *but* you‚Äôll need to invest more time up front. If you‚Äôre detail-obsessed and enjoy tweaking systems, go for it. If you just need to stop overdrafting and make rent comfortably? Start with an app.

You can always switch later once you know what works.

# Do budgeting apps offer enough customization for complex finances?

Short answer: **some do-but not all**.

Apps like YNAB and Monarch have gotten way more customizable in 2025. You can rename categories, add goals, set up rules, and even simulate cash flow. But if you‚Äôre juggling multiple income streams, unique tax situations, or running a side business, you‚Äôll eventually hit a wall.

That‚Äôs where a custom spreadsheet shines. It lets you build around *your* weird, beautiful, complicated financial life.

If you need full flexibility with zero guardrails? Spreadsheet wins. If you want smart defaults and 80% automation with 20% customization? Apps are evolving fast.

# Can I migrate my spreadsheet data into a budgeting app easily?

Mostly yes-but it depends on the app.

Apps like Monarch and Copilot now allow **CSV imports**, which means you can export your spreadsheet data and bring in historical transactions, categories, or net worth numbers. It takes a little setup, and things won‚Äôt always match perfectly, but it‚Äôs doable.

YNAB also supports file imports-but fair warning: some formatting is picky, and you may need to clean up the data first.

Once you‚Äôre in, though, most apps make your past data feel instantly more visual and usable. It‚Äôs a great move if you‚Äôre spreadsheet-tired and want something that *feels* more alive.

# Are budgeting apps accurate and up-to-date with bank transactions?

Yes-for the most part. In 2025, most top budgeting apps sync directly with your bank, often through Plaid, MX, or Akoya. These APIs are secure and updated regularly. But there are still occasional syncing delays (especially with smaller banks or credit unions), and sometimes a transaction might not auto-categorize the way you want.

If 98% accuracy is enough-and you‚Äôre okay checking things once a week-apps work great. If you need to know your *exact* financial status down to the cent at all times? A manual spreadsheet (or hybrid system) is still more precise.

Just know that perfection in money tracking often comes at the cost of time and sanity.

# What‚Äôs the best budgeting method for 2025: app, spreadsheet, or hybrid?

The best method? **The one that helps you feel in control-*****without*** **burning you out.**

If you're overwhelmed, distracted, and need a system that runs on autopilot: **start with an app.** If you're analytical, detail-driven, and love building your own rules: **use a spreadsheet.** If you want power *and* perspective? **Go hybrid.** Track spending with an app, plan big moves in a spreadsheet.

2025 isn‚Äôt about choosing between digital vs DIY. It‚Äôs about building a system that fits your brain, your budget, and your bandwidth.

He lives a very normal life, very active in his church, very musically talented, playing multiple instruments, has friends and hobbies, and goes deer hunting every fall like the rest of my family. It‚Äôs insane to me that abortion would even be suggested at this point. Also, if he really felt that way, he probably should‚Äôve said that before we got pregnant. I feel like it‚Äôs a huge blow to our relationship, how I view him, and honestly it‚Äôs disrespectful to my cousin, who I adore. I don‚Äôt even want to look at him right now. I don‚Äôt know how to move past this. Honestly makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt even deserve to be in the baby‚Äôs life, whether the baby has a chromosomal abnormality or not. We‚Äôre already on edge because a few weeks ago he suggested we rehome some of our dogs when the baby comes because he refuses to live in a house with dogs and a baby‚Ä¶ I never thought that bringing a child into the world would be the end of our relationship but he‚Äôs taken so many controversial stances since we found out about the baby.. I truly feel like I‚Äôve lost a huge amount of respect for him and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll come up with more unreasonable things for us to argue about throughout this journey. I was laying in bed alone last night thinking this is NOT how I imagined my first pregnancy, and it makes me so sad that this time isn‚Äôt centered around joy and excitement and instead around his insane and unrealistic expectations for our ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Just to be clear: I will not terminate the pregnancy if we discover we‚Äôre predisposed to something on the NIPT testing. If he really doesn‚Äôt agree with raising a child with Down‚Äôs syndrome then I will leave him, plain and simple.  ",10,1751202314.0,BabyBumps,77,0.58,False

Brief background I hope:
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with MS for 20 years RRMS.  I had what the doctor called an aggressive onset. Though in hindsight, I think it was triggered or however people get it in my early teens.  I mistook fatigue for depression for decades. That is depressing in itself.
Several week‚Äôs before I ended up in the hospital, I was out with an Italian girlfriend of mine.  Before even drinking a while beer, I stepped down from a barstool and my ankle just gave way.  Then a few weeks later I got Bell‚Äôs palsy.  Timelines are hard for me to remember. It was weeks or a couple of months. I went to see my gp and he said you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs probably Bell‚Äôs palsy but here‚Äôs the number of a neurologist if you‚Äôre concerned.  I took the card but was not concerned. In a weird coincidence my immediate boss had just had it and one of 
Our clients had to cancel or was unavailable because they had Bell‚Äôs palsy. So i recovered from ‚ÄúBell‚Äôs Palsy‚Äù and then my on again off again (or so I thought) boyfriend took a job across the country and I was infuriated.
I doubled down on my career. 
My officemate and I were working on launching a creative side business over two physically intense weekends
During the first weekend, I lost my breath while jogging through a worksite, unusual for me. That was Saturday.  Monday morning, my place was a mess as usual. I was scrambling to get my regular work done, that I had not doneüëÄ. I planned to take my work folder to a nearby coffee shop. I hopped in the shower and began washing my hair.  After a few minutes of vigorous scrubbing, I could not lift my arms over my head anymore. But because I was trained to disregard my needs and instincts, I was not worried I was pissed.  And I just rinsed it a little and thought that‚Äôs going to just have to be good enough for today. So I head to the coffee shop. I walk outside my door and walk right into a parking sign that is always there. I get to the coffee shop and I haven‚Äôt taken a sip but I cannot focus in the reading for work I had to do. I read the same sentence over and over. I thought let‚Äôs just get to work and I‚Äôll finish there.  As I unlocked the door to my office, I began to drool.

Anyway, 20 years later I‚Äôve been living with this enigmatic disease. I‚Äôm sure many of you relate that MS rules the world.  I have a million little things I do, tools I‚Äôve collected to get through.

So my friends and family know my history.
YET!!!!!! They still don‚Äôt understand that it is a fatigue disease that demands and punishes.  That I have to be oh so careful putting anything on my calendar. The most important thing to me right now is conserving my energy to raise my child. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve given Spoon Theory to all of them, and some have sent it to me.  The point is, I can‚Äôt explain my living experience to them.  I wouldn‚Äôt want them to know it. I certainly don‚Äôt want to be pitied. So I generally keep private.
I bitch to my therapist.

But every once in a while, one of them won‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt do something. I know in part, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want to think of their loved l
one as suffering.  And I think in part, people only think of themselves and how I am affecting them.

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been in a pretty rough mental space‚Äîburnout, anxiety, constant comparison. I was spiraling in my thoughts, and it honestly felt like everything good was just passing me by unnoticed.

Then one night, I randomly asked ChatGPT to help me build a simple daily gratitude habit. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. Just wanted to get some journaling prompts or something to ground me. What happened next was kind of‚Ä¶ unexpected.

It didn‚Äôt just give me prompts. It helped me reflect, slowly reframe how I see my day. Every morning or night, I‚Äôd spend 5‚Äì10 minutes talking through what went well, what I was thankful for, even if it was as simple as ‚Äúmy coffee was perfect‚Äù or ‚Äúmy friend sent a meme.‚Äù The AI would gently nudge me to go deeper without judgment or pressure. No toxic positivity. Just space to breathe.

Over time, that little practice snowballed. I stopped doomscrolling as much. I started texting people just to say thanks. It was like the fog started lifting‚Äînot all at once, but steadily.

I‚Äôm not saying AI is magic. It‚Äôs just a tool. But for me, it became a kind of mirror‚Äîone that helped me see the good I was blind to.

So yeah. Weirdly, I‚Äôm grateful to AI, for helping me be more grateful in life. And that feels worth sharing.

If anyone‚Äôs feeling stuck or numb, and journaling seems overwhelming‚Äîmaybe try asking a chatbot to walk through it with you. You might be surprised what you discover.",1,1751202261.0,u_Fragrant_Bit_4957,0,1.0,False

1lne6lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lne6lp/thank_you_rloseit/,Thank You r/loseit!,"Before I get sappy I'll share some context about my journey.

I'm male, 28, 5'11, relativly inactive (work a desk job seated all day) and my starting weight was 353 pounds. 

As of this week (one year since starting) I finally hit my long term goal weight of 250 pounds which is the weight I was for highschool football. Turns out when you do sports 6 days a week you can eat as much as you want whenever you want, but when the sports go and the eating habits stay you have a major issue on your hands.

Losing this weight has truly changed my quality of life immensely and I owe it all to this community!

I would often browse online about weight loss and once I did enough reading to feel good about myself and pretend I was serious I would go back to doing nothing. I don't remember how but one day I ended up on this subreddit and someone mention in a post the easiest way to get started was to read the quick start guide for this sub.

After some more reading I figured it can't be that hard to just download an app so I downloaded my fitness pal and started writing down what I ate. This opened my eyes and at that point I knew it was time for a change.

Constantly reading about other people's journeys, road blocks they hit and tips they had gave me the motivation to keep going and not panic if my weight went back up a little.

Again THANK YOU to this community! Around the 6 month mark of being on this journey, without pushing it on them my parents both downloaded my fitness pal and had started their own journeys as well!

I'll throw some tips below I used that made a big difference, obviously these don't work for everyone but hopefully it helps 1 or 2 folks who read this post. These likely are all common knowledge but they helped me the most.

TIPS:
1. Consistancy is key, stay strong. No matter how many bad days I encountered where I exceeded my deficit the most important next step is to just get back on track the next day. Don't beat yourself up,  just start again, be kind to yourself this journey is hard enough already without beating yourself up.

2. Meal prep is huge. I'm not a great cook in the kitchen so my start was batch making work lunches. Ground beef and Rice was my go to but you could do chicken, vegetables, salads, fish. Find something you like and get consistent with having them.

3. Liquid Calories are the silent killer. Probably not advisable but I went cold Turkey on liquid cals. I love coffee and water so I drank exclusively black coffee and water for some time. Eventually I introduced sparkling water and diet pops for flavour until my self control was decent enough I could have a beer or regular pop and not fall back into old habits. The mindset here is that a beer or two is a snack you allocated calories for instead of that coffee crisp bar or bowl of chips.

4. Make smart choices when getting take out. My A&W order used to be an 740cal Cheddar bacon uncle burger, 610cal poutine and a 160 cal root beer, that's 1500cals for one meal! Now I get a Teen Burger 500cals, a regular fry 300cals and a diet pop, 800cals is much more reasonable and a burger and fries is still plenty to eat.

5. Keep healthy snacks handy. Not only am I  snacker but I eat when I'm bored and watching shows. The difference between having coffee crisps on hand vs apples and bananas was a game changer for me. A big step for me was finding out what healthier options I enjoyed and then committing to those. The occasional 260cal coffee crisp isn't going to break the bank however, so don't think you have to do anything drastic like quit you favorite candy bar for life.",7,1751202224.0,loseit,6,1.0,False

1lndsrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FragranceStories/comments/1lndsrd/indigo_perfumery_review/,Indigo Perfumery Review,"Hey ya‚Äôll! I spent yesterday at my favorite place, Indigo Perfumery, and figured I should give ya‚Äôll a rundown of everything I smelled, sampled, and bought!

The first thing that blew me away was Mabelle O‚ÄôRama‚Äôs Forbidden Bloom. It is the most heady, beautiful, fruity summer floral. Absolutely stunning. The peach in the opening really compliments the frangipani and gardenia in a stunning way.  The only thing is, I tested it on skin, and it is so strong I think I do go a bit nose blind to it after a while. That could‚Äôve just been everything in the perfumery tuckering out my nose, so I‚Äôll have to get a sample at some point and see. 

I spent a fair bit of time at the Arquiste shelf, and ended up leaving with a sample of Tropical! It‚Äôs a stunning scent, inspired by a garden in M√©rida, Yucat√°n. It smells like you‚Äôre sitting beneath a guava tree, halfway between blooming and fruiting, with humid green vegetation all around you.  I put it on about an hour ago, so I haven‚Äôt hit the woody vanilla base just yet, but I‚Äôm sure it will be divine! 

Smelled Almond Suede as well, just to refresh my memory. Inspired by Andalusian Spain, it smells of suede (I swear it‚Äôs different from a normal leather accord, it smells a bit fuzzy somehow!) and Andalusian marzipan (saffron, spices, orange blossom, almond). My wife was absolutely obsessed, and insists we save up for it some Fall! 

Next up, I tried two scents from Eris Parfum. Most of their line focuses on animalic notes, so I haven‚Äôt tried those yet, but I did sample Delta of Venus, Scorpio Rising, and Green Spell. Delta of Venus is another stunning guava scent, with violet leaf and galbanum giving it an intensely green quality. The guava is so beautiful and sweet! Sandalwood gives it a warm, creamy touch as well. I ended up leaving with a sample. 

Scorpio Rising was a stunning spicy scent. Woody, spicy, leathery, with immortelle for some sweetness. Definitely worth exploring in the autumn. 

Green Spell was incredible. They take about every leafy green note you can think of, particularly tomato leaf and galbanum, and cram it into a lovely bottle. Definitely something to get a bottle or decant of eventually. 

My wife and I tried many other green scents yesterday, like DS and Durga‚Äôs Bistro Waters! It‚Äôs absolutely a delightful fragrance, with bell pepper and herbs. My wife left with a sample! 

My wife‚Äôs second sample ended up being Poivre Pomelo by Atelier Materi, which is another gorgeous scent for summer. Beautiful pepper and citrus, exactly as the name would imply. 

I was on an orris hunt yesterday, and was particularly taken aback by three scents: Jorum Studios Trimerous, Astrophil and Stella‚Äôs Paris Ch√©ri, and Dusita‚Äôs Splendiris. Trimerous is like the perfect, waxy, lipsticky orris scent. Like you‚Äôve just put on a fine, luxury lipstick, from a brand that still puts real orris in their formula. 

Paris Ch√©ri, meanwhile, is a gourmand orris situation. Cardamom, coffee, Lily of the valley, labdanum, vanilla, tonka, and more! It‚Äôs gorgeous, but definitely more suited to cooler weather. 

Dusita‚Äôs Splendiris, on the other hand, is like sunshine! The combo of Rose de Mai, orris butter, and citrus fruits was absolutely beautiful on the mouillette. Like light passing through a purple stained glass window, to me. 

I ended up leaving with a bottle of O, Unknown! by Imaginary Authors, the soon-to-be discontinued scent that set me off on my orris hunt in the first place! I loved the other three orris scents, but none had that creamy quality I was looking for. O, Unknown is like someone made a plant based milk out of orris root, and used that to cream their tea. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful, and I will treasure the bottle I purchased until I run out. Maybe they‚Äôll bring it back someday, but for now, this bottle will have to last me! 

Honorable Mentions (equally good, but I don‚Äôt feel like doing a full write up. Ask in the comments if you‚Äôd like more info!)

Atelier Matieri, C√®dre Figalia

Eau de Boujee, Verdant

Astrophil and Stella, Chromodoro

Sandal Rice, BADAR

All in all, Indigo Perfumery is a lovely little store, run by a wonderful woman! The customer service is wonderful. She‚Äôs happy to let you search to your hearts content on your own, but is also incredible knowledgeable about her stock if you need advice!

If you ever find yourself in Cleveland, dear redditors, the 15 minute sojourn over to Lakewood is worth it for the perfume and the food! If you need food recs, Dang Good Foods is the best little Singaporean joint ever, and Rood Food and Pie is a funky Lakewood staple.

Late on a Sunday afternoon we are chilling out on the sofa. I reach across to grab the TV remote from my wifes side of the coffee table and bump a half eaten bag of wasabi peas onto the floor. They went everywhere! So my teenage daughter had, seconds ago, been giving me a hard time as they do. The usual, your breathing sounds annoying kind of thing.

So, after a few four letter words from me, in a cheeky defiance to my unfortunate incident, and with a smirk, she reaches down and grabs one of these wasabi peas and pops it in her mouth. Instantly her legs kick out in a spasm, she spits out the pea and screams that it shot her in the tongue! Seconds later, in response to the commotion, my dog decides to lift her lazy ass out of her bed and join the chaos by eating one or two of the peas herself! Half a second later she is going back and forwards between licking her lips, coughing, and trying to get to eat more of these spicy little delicious peas.

The sight of this all happening at once had me in stitches, litterally tears of laughter are streaming from my face.

With mirror dungeon 5 about to go away, I decided to finally have a go at a solo run before md6. I was mainly inspired to do this by [Q-Hatred's](https://www.youtube.com/@Q-Hatred) videos.

I decided to do the run with maid Ryoshu, since she had both an evade and attack weight. I uptied her to 4 and Red Eyes Open to 3 for the run. Her main weakness was being pretty easy to stagger, which happened quite often. I didn't have all the best solo support passives, so I just went with the best ones I had. I propably should have used Tingtang Hong Lu for extra damage instead of Fanghunt for extra bleed mitigation, but Fanghunt had full rest bonus. Of particular note is Barber Outis, as a healing support passive that Maid Ryoshu could fuel on her own.

Despite only going for 5 floors it was really damn difficult, and took about 25 resets on the succesful run, almost all of those on 60 cost unfocused encounters. That run succeeded mostly because i got really lucky, an ego resource generating gift in rewards (coffee and cranes) and got lucky with 2 ? nodes that came up before I had to fight anything on that particular floor, first kqe-1j-23's event where i wrote dumbass to fight him and easily got full sp and fueled Barber Outis' passive without taking much damage and then I got Homeward (the painting that heals on encounter start) which helped a lot. I had to reset a lot on G-corp soldiers before I had the idea to use superbia for overclocked Contempt Awe, which turned of my gluttony fatality and gave 7 protection on the next turn to build up skill slots. After that I got coffee and cranes for ego resource generation and was able fuel my egos (all but Forest for the Flames required envy).

It really was a staggering difference between focused and unfocused encounters. Pretty much every focuded encounter was made easy by an evade, barring the couple times I had to reset due to getting unlycjy with the 5% early in a turn. Unfocused encounters were nightmares. After the firsty floor, once I had coffee and cranes the few unfocused encounters I had mostly didn't require resets, on floor 3 while on my way to show Nelly who is the real chief buttler I got through the dead rabbits without much trouble. They got their revenge on floor 4, where it took me over 15 resets to get through. I jsut get getting staggered and dying no matter what I did, trying to corrode into Contempt wasn't enough, I couldn't stager enough rabbits to survive turn 3 no matter how many egos i used, what finally worked was overclocking Contempt on turn 1 then overclocking both Red Eyes to corrode into Red Eyes Open on turn 3. I finally managed to both stagger/kill enough rabbits to heal enough to survive and then went to Shock Centipede with no envy and very low sp and won easily.

After that scare I picked Miracle Bogak, which I knew to be really easy, since the whole floor is just 1 long focused encounter.

All in all it was somewhat fun (not taking into account raging against the rabbits) and challenging, but definely only for pretty stacked accounts. Other than taking a limbillion unopposed attacks in unfocused encounters, md events become pretty difficult to succeed in, since only 1 sinner is propably going to have sp. Might be worth using the shop heal to fill Tingtang Hong Lu's sp to do checks with him. If you're not interested in doing solos yourself I do recommend [Q-Hatred's](https://www.youtube.com/@Q-Hatred) videos, they're well edited and have interesting commentary on the soloing identity.

**How is one supposed to act as a mystery pryer?**

I asked the old man and he said the answer lies within me. He said that for different people 'acting' can mean different things. In the end its up to us and our interpretation of how we see the meaning behind the sequence name. However he did mention about the principle of 'do as you wish but do no harm'

So I did the obvious thing, went to cafe and bought a dictionary. After thorough reading, and with my potion digesting a bit, I gained a few basic points on how I should possibly act.

Mysteries on simple terms are the unknown or something thats not understood well enough. It may also signify the hidden truth that is not understood or even thought about. That seems to be why i feel my potion digest whenever I read stuff back at the cafe. However my mystical senses tell me that alone wont be enough

Pryer is a bit more complicated. Its reserved for people who are excessively curious and inquisitive to the point of intrusion. Does this mean I have to gossip more? Old Bob has also told me that sometimes being too curious can result in your demise and that this exceptionally true in the world of beyonders were knowledge can be a double edged sword. Does this mean if I am not careful the chance me dying is very high? The word pryer also seemed to signify this. The forceful collection of knowledge seems to be a very dangerous thing.

However direct interpretation of the sequence name also seems a bit absurd. Otherwise old man could have directly told me this.



""Hmmmm I don't like this"" I quietly mumbled as I left the cafe. At this rate my digestion would be extremely slow. I want to help Bob. I did join him in one of his mission against wild bandits {Had to join even though he retired due to low manpower}. I helped confirm his divination and provided a bit of support. But honestly I felt as a dead weight. If I advance to seq 8 i should be able to atleast defend myself. Also I after ,my advancement, felt an thread of fate connecting me to a greater destiny. And I wanted to be strong enough to chase it.

As I entered our the house, utterly dejected, Bob out of kitchen yells ""Lad did you pack your stuff yet?"" Huh? stuff?

Then it came to my mind that I would be returning home tomorrow, back to my village

""I am doing it now!"" I yell back as I rush to gather my stuff. ""It would be a good opportunity for you"" He said later during dinner ""You can maybe get inspiration for your principles back at your village"". I agreed with him and told him to be careful since I will not be there to help him. He gave me a chuckle and said he will. I went to sleep excited

==============================================================================

Homecoming was more pleasant than i thought. I was worried how others would view me or will my parents be mad. But everyone was chill and happy for me. I helped others, told them about the stuff i learned and how to bake and make diiferent types of bread. As I did I felt my digestion increasing at a very rapid rate. As I pondered on how my digestion was going so smoothly and quickly. Then it hit me. The reason why I chose this path was to be a knowledgeable person, to spread wisdom and bread to everyone in this world, to be a person who has seen it all. Now as I explain to the kids why bread with tea is better than coffee I feel a change take place in my body. My potion was finally digested

==============================================================================

As I head my way back to the city, I feel extremely proud. I felt I finally understood my goals and I would actually be able to reach it. I couldn't wait to tell old man.",1,1751200821.0,LordofTheMysteriesRP,2,1.0,False

Jab main aur Rohit bhaiya Coorg ke liye bike pe nikle, toh dil mein ek alag hi masti thi! üòú Main unke peeche baithi thi, unki strong back ko tightly pakad ke, aur thandi hawa mere baalon ko uda rahi thi. üå¨Ô∏è Bhaiya ne bike chalate hue ekdum romantic mahol bana diya. Woh bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, yeh hawa, yeh rasta, aur tu mere peeche‚Ä¶ isse zyada perfect kya ho sakta hai?‚Äù üòò Main sharma ke unki kamar pe thodi si chikoti kati aur kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, aap bhi na, full filmy ho!‚Äù üòú

Raste mein humne kafi baatein ki. Bhaiya meri taarif pe taarif kiye ja rahe the. ‚ÄúSheetal, tu toh ab ekdum heroine jaisi ho gayi hai. Tera smile, tera figure‚Ä¶ haye, main toh fida hoon!‚Äù üòç Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúAap bhi na, bas meri tareef karte ho. Aur aap? Koi heroine mili ki nahi?‚Äù Unhone ek naughty si hasi di, ‚ÄúArre, meri heroine toh yahin baithi hai!‚Äù üòò Mera dil toh dhadak-dhadak kar raha tha, par maine masti mein kaha, ‚ÄúHaye, bhaiya, yeh dialogue toh Bollywood se churaya hai!‚Äù üòú Hum dono hasne lage, aur rasta ekdum sapne jaisa lag raha tha‚Äîhariyali, thandi hawa, aur bhaiya ki woh flirty baatein.

Ek jagah hum ruke toh bhaiya ne mujhe bike se utara aur kaha, ‚ÄúSheetal, ek selfie toh banta hai!‚Äù üì∏ Unhone mujhe apne paas kheench liya, aur jab unhone apna haath meri kamar pe rakha, toh mere dil mein ek current sa dauda. üò≥ Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, koi dekh lega!‚Äù Par woh bole, ‚ÄúArre, yahan jungle mein kaun dekhega? Bas tu aur main!‚Äù üòé Fir humne khoob selfies li, kabhi has has ke, kabhi thodi si masti karke. Unki aankhon mein ek alag si chamak thi, jo mujhe baar baar khud ki taraf kheench rahi thi.

Coorg jab hum pahunche, toh sham ho chuki thi. Bhaiya ne ek hi room book kiya tha, aur main thodi si surprise hui. üò≥ Maine pucha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, ek hi room?‚Äù Unhone ek pyaari si smile di aur kaha, ‚ÄúArre, Sheetal, tu meri favorite hai, saath mein hi maza aayega na!‚Äù üòò Sach kahu, mujhe bhi unke saath accha lag raha tha, toh maine zyada socha nahi. Room ek chhoti si cozy cottage mein tha, jahan se Coorg ke jungle ka ekdum dreamy view dikh raha tha. üåø

Humne dinner kiya‚Äîmasala dosa aur filter coffee ka maza hi alag tha! üòã Fir bhaiya ne ek whisky ki bottle nikali aur bole, ‚ÄúChal, thodi si party karte hain!‚Äù üçπ Humne drinks li, aur mahaul ekdum mast ho gaya. Bhaiya ne kaha, ‚ÄúSheetal, truth and dare khelte hain?‚Äù üòà Maine hanste hue kaha, ‚ÄúHaye, bhaiya, yeh toh dangerous hai!‚Äù Par main bhi mood mein thi, toh humne game shuru kar diya.

Pehle bhaiya ne truth chuna. Maine pucha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, sach bolo, aap mujhe kitna miss karte ho jab main nahi hoti?‚Äù üòè Unhone ek sip liya aur bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu nahi hoti toh dil mein ek khali pan sa lagta hai. Tu meri favorite hai, yaar!‚Äù üòç Mera dil toh pighal gaya, par maine masti mein kaha, ‚ÄúAcha ji, itna pyar? Ab meri baari!‚Äù Maine dare chuna, aur bhaiya ne kaha, ‚ÄúMeri godi mein aake baith!‚Äù üò≥ Main sharma gayi, par nasha aur unki woh naughty smile mujhe rok nahi payi. üòú

Main unki godi mein baith gayi, aur woh meri kamar pe haath rakh ke mujhe dheere se sehlane lage. Unki ungliyan meri kamar pe aise chal rahi thi jaise woh koi geet baja rahe ho. üòò Fir unhone mere kandhon pe ek soft sa kiss kiya, aur main toh bas gudgudi se pagal ho rahi thi! üòç Woh bolte rahe, ‚ÄúSheetal, tera yeh slim waist, yeh curves‚Ä¶ haye, tu kitni perfect hai!‚Äù Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, aap bhi na, bas meri tareef!‚Äù Par sach kahu, unka touch mujhe ek alag hi duniya mein le ja raha tha.

Fir baat aage badhi, aur bhaiya ne dheere se meri top ke neeche haath daala. üò≥ Maine thodi si resist ki, ‚ÄúBhaiya, yeh kya kar rahe ho?‚Äù Par unhone mujhe tightly pakad liya aur bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu meri hai, bas thodi si masti karne de.‚Äù Unka touch ekdum intense tha, aur unhone meri top aur bra utar di. üò≥ Woh mere boobs ko pyaar se sehlate hue bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, tere yeh boobs ke liye main jaan de sakta hoon!‚Äù üòç Unka pyar ekdum wild tha‚Äîkabhi woh unhe softly dabate, kabhi thoda sa tightly, aur meri saansein tezi se chalne lagi.

# The Intense Night

Haye, doston, us raat room mein andhera ekdum gehra tha, bas ek chhoti si candle ki roshni thi, jo halki si flicker karke hum dono ke chehre pe jaadu sa bikherti thi. üò≥ Candle ki woh dim light bhaiya ke chiseled jawline aur unki intense aankhon ko aur bhi sexy bana rahi thi. Unhone mujhe bed pe dheere se letaya, aur jab woh mere upar jhuke, toh unki garam saansein meri skin pe feel ho rahi thi. üòò Unki aankhon mein ek ajeeb si chingaari thi, jaise woh mujhe poora apne bas mein kar lena chahte ho. Maine unki nazron se nazrein milayi, par dil mein ek toofan sa uth raha tha‚Äîsharam, excitement, aur thodi si dar ka mixture.

Bhaiya ne mere haathon ko bed ke upar tightly pakad liya, unki grip itni strong thi ki mujhe laga jaise woh mujhe kabhi chhodenge hi nahi. üò≥ Unhone apne lips mere gaalon pe rakhe, pehle ek soft sa kiss, fir dheere dheere meri jawline se leke meri neck tak chumte rahe. Har kiss ke saath meri saansein aur tezi se chalne lagi, aur mera dil zor zor se dhadak raha tha. Unka pura erection mujhe unki jeans ke through feel ho raha tha, aur maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, please, yeh galat hai! Hum cousins hain, stop karo na!‚Äù üò∂ Mera dil bol raha tha ki yeh nahi hona chahiye, par unka touch mujhe ek alag hi duniya mein le ja raha tha.

Par bhaiya toh sunne ke mood mein hi nahi the. Unki awaaz mein ek desperate, almost possessive sa pyar tha jab unhone kaha, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu meri hai, bas ek baar mujhe feel karne de.‚Äù üòç Unhone meri baat ko ekdum ignore kiya aur apne haathon se meri jeans ke button pe hath rakha. Maine apne haathon se unhe dhakelne ki koshish ki, ‚ÄúBhaiya, nahi, please, mat karo!‚Äù Par woh itne strong the ki meri koshish unke saamne bacchon jaisi lag rahi thi. üò≥ Unhone ek hi jhatke mein meri jeans aur panty dono neeche kheench di, aur fir apni shirt ko utara, unki muscular chest candlelight mein chamak rahi thi. Fir unhone apni jeans bhi utar di, aur ab hum dono bed pe ekdum nange the. Mera dil itni zor se dhadak raha tha ki mujhe laga yeh abhi nikal jayega! üò∂

Bhaiya ne mujhe missionary style mein tightly pakad liya, mere haathon ko fir se bed pe daba diya, aur apne garam, toned badan se mujhe poora cover kar liya. üò≥ Unka weight mere upar tha, aur unka erection meri thighs ke beech ek garam, pulsating sensation de raha tha. Maine chillayi, ‚ÄúBhaiya, bas karo, main nahi chahti yeh!‚Äù Par woh ekdum wild ho chuke the. Unhone meri thighs ko apne haathon se thoda sa spread kiya, unki ungliyan meri skin pe aise chal rahi thi jaise woh meri har curve ko yaad karna chahte ho. Fir unhone dheere se mujhe penetrate karna shuru kiya.

Har thrust ke saath, bhaiya bolte rahe, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu kitni mulayam hai, kitni sundar hai‚Ä¶ mera dil tujhpe fida hai!‚Äù üòç Unki awaaz mein ek wild, almost animalistic passion tha, aur unka badan mere badan se chipka hua tha, hum dono ke sweat ek doosre mein mix ho rahe the. Pehle toh main resist karti rahi, apne haathon se unke chest ko push karti rahi, apni thighs ko band karne ki koshish ki, par woh har baar mujhe aur tightly pakad lete. Unka erection meri andar tak feel ho raha tha, har move ke saath ek deep, intense sensation de raha tha. üò∂ Unhone kabhi dheere dheere thrust kiya, jaise mujhe tease karna chahte ho, aur kabhi thoda zor se, jaise apna poora control mujhpe dikhana chahte ho. Unki saansein meri neck pe garam garam lag rahi thi, aur woh meri kaan mein whisper kar rahe the, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu meri fantasy hai, tujhe aise pyar karna mera sapna tha.‚Äù üòò

Yeh sab almost adhe ghante tak chalta raha. Kabhi woh meri neck pe kiss karte, kabhi meri collarbone pe, aur kabhi meri breasts ko apne haathon se pyaar se sehlate, unhe squeeze karte hue. üò≥ Meri awaaz dheere dheere kamzor padti gayi, aur ek ajeeb si baat hui‚Äîmera dil aur dimaag toh resist kar rahe the, par mera badan unke saath ek rhythm mein aa gaya. üò∂ Unka touch, unki intensity, unka possessive pyar‚Äîsab kuch itna overwhelming tha ki main apne aap ko unmein kho rahi thi. Unhone meri hips ko pakad ke mujhe aur kareeb kheench liya, aur har thrust ke saath mujhe laga jaise woh mujhe poora apna bana rahe ho.

Jab bhaiya climax ke kareeb pahunche, toh unki saansein aur tezi se chalne lagi, aur unhone ek deep, guttural moan kiya. Unhone mujhe tightly pakad liya, aur fir mere pet pe ejaculate kiya, unka garam release meri skin pe feel hua. üòç Woh mere upar hi let gaye, unki chest meri chest se chipki hui thi, aur hum dono ki saansein ek doosre se sync ho gayi. Meri thighs abhi bhi thodi si kaanp rahi thi, aur mera dil ekdum confused tha‚Äîyeh kya tha? Yeh galat tha, par kyun itna intense, itna addictive laga?

Maine dheere se unhe gale laga liya, unki garam skin meri skin se touch ho rahi thi. üò∂ Sach kahu, last mein mujhe unka yeh wild, forceful pyar accha laga‚Äîjaise unka passion meri andar ki submissive side ko jagah diya ho. üòò Hum dono thak ke ek doosre ki baahon mein hi so gaye, unki saansein meri neck pe abhi bhi feel ho rahi thi. Dil mein ek ajeeb sa mixture tha‚Äîthodi si sharam, thoda sa dard, aur thodi si khushi. üòç Yeh kya tha‚Äîpyar, lust, ya kuch aur?

My name is Grzegorz Zawadka, and I'm launching a bold and fun global social experiment that could literally change lives ‚Äì starting with mine, but hopefully inspiring many more.

The Challenge:

Let‚Äôs try to raise $1,000,000 by doing the simplest thing possible:
‚û°Ô∏è 1 million people donating just $1.

That‚Äôs it. No tricks. No scam. Just a real test of how powerful the internet can be when we unite.

I'm sharing everything transparently and will document the entire journey publicly on my Instagram:

üì≤ https://www.instagram.com/sweetduck83

üß™ Why am I doing this?

Because I believe the world is full of generous, curious, chaotic-good people who just want to be part of something simple and fun.
If we succeed, it proves that collective power beats algorithms, ads, and influencers.

Think about it ‚Äì people spend more than $1 on coffee, tips, or Candy Crush skins every day.
This time, it‚Äôs just $1 for a global, historic, decentralized movement.

‚ùìWhy should you care?

You don't need to. But if this works ‚Äî you were part of something that proved what 1 million strangers can do just for the fun of it.
Imagine the news headlines:

And if it fails? Well, we still tried something wild. And that‚Äôs already a win.

I just moved out of ANOTHER house because of a weirdo roommate (stole stuff, never cleaned, lied to landlord) and I JUST quit my other job because of an overt narc manager (who everyone at the job was aware of but couldn't fire because of staff shortage), to just now move in with ANOTHER overt narc.

I have to vent and don't need much advice as I have become very well-read on how to deal with these people, but I mainly just want to blow off major steam.

Ever since I moved in, I noticed this guy took issue with me. He always interrupts when I speak, always turns the conversation back to him, strokes his own ego nearly every time he starts talking, always disagrees with whatever I have to say (even if it's an arbitrary fact, like ""the sky is blue""), oh and obvious gaslighting when he is caught blatantly lying. Not only to me, but obviously to most women of the house he speaks very condescendingly. Always giving unsollicited advice, explaining stuff you didn't ask for, taking stupid argument points to start discussions, laughing at you for doing something as dumb as cutting garlic, yadiya.

He, however, tends to have a special obsession with me at the same time (probably since I'm the newest in the house), where he will try to get as much alone-time with me as possible, and he is SET on asking me uncomfortable questions, or wants to know right around everything about me and my bf. He is also in the common areas 24/7 like he is just WAITING for people to walk in so he can yap their ears off, and will absolutely ignore if you are wearing headphones or are in a hurry. He will even act offended when you do not take your headphones off to fall into his dumb conversation-traps.

One time when I was in the living room enjyoing my morning coffee with my boyfriend in silence, he had to interrupt to start bashing me about a book I had borrowed. It was such a dead-end conversation, where I literally told him multiple times I will give his book back right now if needed (it was in my room and I quite literally had not touched it). I did not look up from my phone and neither did my bf. Yet he had to go on a rampage about how ""you should have made time to read it"" and ""if you don't want it I can give it to someone else blah blah"".

There are other times where he insists on making me incredibly uncomfortable with sexual questions when I am alone. Asking me questions such as if I have found the majority of men that I have slept with (before my bf, or even my bf) to be more dominant/submissive (obviously to segway into how he is the total package by possessing a bit of both), or if women read erotic books as their form of self-pleasure (yes, he has actually asked this and way, way worse). When, one hectic day, I opened up to my roommates about a seriously inappropriate situation between me and a coworker, he turned the conversation to him. Whenever someone is having a conversation that does not involve him he HAS to interrupt in any way shape or form (starting to loudly read passages from his stupid bible-sized book, playing music loudly, or just interrupting in general).

My house is a 13-student flat on a university campus and is otherwise super close. House name, traditions, eating dinner together etc. So it's not really a matter of ""just be on your own"" (although that is what I am doing the majority of the time). We have to be semi-social and organise stuff together. As such, the guy has a whole social dynamic to put his insecure claws into and stir up drama. He shit talks roommates, sets really dumb narratives, always laughing behind people's backs, lies about others. Organising something is a literal hell because if I happen to be the one doing it he gets jealous and has to undermine any decision-making or ideas. And somehow - eventhough a lot of roommates have expressed their annoyance about him- he is still able to make an impression because he is JUST so OVERTLY convincing in how wrong he is. He just spews bullshit with no second thought, and I guess that is what always somewhat makes an impact. Also, a lot of people just don't think fighting him is worth the headache, since it gives him the attention he desperately craves.

Anyways, no I do not want to move out (and financially this is just not an option). I have to stay here for like, minimum a year but luckily my bf lives walking distance. But I'm just so tired of someone like this always spawning somewhere in my life where I can not escape them. I have to think twice about nearly everything I do. So far, my tactics just consist of grey-rocking him when I'm alone with him, and ignoring his attempts to stir up debates. I'm also taking a short mental crash-course in regaining some self-trust. If you have any valuable advice from similar situations, feel free to share. But please understand I can not do anything drastic like completely isolate myself or move out.",3,1751199949.0,badroommates,10,0.67,False

Gotta say the show did a bad job of focusing on the one near-MVP season Dalton had, 2015.  His [playoff stats](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/andy-dalton-playoff-stats) are the thing to focus on.  He led his team to the playoffs in the **four seasons** before 2015 and **each time** he was one-and-done.  He was on his way for a fifth in 2015 before injuring his thumb.  He was good enough to get you into the playoffs, but not make a deep run, four seasons in a row!  *He got your hopes up. but then he crushed them*, the ultimate state of frustration.  That is purgatory, being locked in a place half way between heaven and hell, not knowing which way you will go.  This is the thing Chris was trying to capture! 
  
Who else can be said to be a teaser like that?  Dak Prescott!  His [playoff stats](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/dak-prescott-playoff-stats) show he makes the playoffs some years, misses others.  They also show that some times he wins once, other times twice, but never gets to the Super Bowl.  He's the guy you sign not really knowing where things will end up, the guy you think can take you all the way but doesn't, the guy who keeps you in QB purgatory.  I think his talent level is about equal to Dalton in his prime, so a good fit for the Dalton Line.  Barnwell you gotta wake up and smell the coffee, the Cowboys fans know him the best, they're right, you're wrong.
  
This is also why Baker Mayfield is for me below the Dalton Line.  I don't feel that he could lead a team deep into the playoffs and perhaps into the Super Bowl.  IMO his [playoff stats](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/baker-mayfield-playoff-stats) show he's mostly a benefactor of the hype-fueled Browns season and is now getting to play in a weak division in the wild card playoff era.  Three times in the playoffs and best case was two wins.  I don't feel he's a genuine franchise QB.  I'd take Andy Dalton in his prime over him for sure, also would take Dak over him too.",2,1751199944.0,heedthecall,1,0.56,False

So ayun, I was at SMX Convention Center since last Friday pa and despite of bickering kung paano pumunta duon sa Lugar nayun and all, it went well Naman for me. Since last Friday, para maagapan antok ko, I walked around sa venue and buy Fresh brewed coffee every afternoon. Ayun, while there, one barista has managed to catch my attention, like oo na na attract ako. Hahaha. 

Nung Friday, a Barista stood beside me and asked for my order and ayun she gave me a paper providing me the order and my real name pa! Hahaha. They made a mistake by giving me a Senior Citizen's discount, like I am 26 huy hahaha tapos gulat siguro si Cashier dahil PRC ID ko pinakita ko sa kanya. Pero ayun nakuha ko yung coffee ko on a cheaper price. 

The next day Naman, same time ako bumili Ng coffee sa kanila, mga 3pm hehehe. Same order, Brewed coffee with no cream and sugar at yung barista na kumuha Ng order ko the previous day ay katabi niya yung cashier and she whispered my name to her and ayun I paid for my coffee on a regular price. Natatawa ako sa response ni Cashier na ""Thank you so muchhhhhhh"" pero Yun gosh naalala nila name ko sa kabila Ng Marami Silang customers na kine-cater since Friday pa sa SMX. After that interaction ay nakaisip ako Ng plan for the barista na crushie ko hahaha. 

Tapos ayun, yeah kanina hahaha. I went for my final purchase sa coffee shop na nasa loob Ng SMX Convention Center with a plan to do something thoughtful Kay Ms. Barista. Since maraming customers nu, si Ms. Barista ay kumuha Ng orders including mine. And nung time na kinukuha na niya yung order ko which is the usual Brewed Coffee, I made my move na. I showed her my phone with this message:

""Ms. Barista, may I ask po kung anong kape Ang gusto niyo po sa menu? Libre kita.""

Tapos ayun nahiya Siya. Sabi niya na di daw Siya nagkakape at baka pagalitan Ng manager niya. Pero nung inalukan ko Ng Caramel Macchiato, Sige Siya pero nung tinanong ko kung hot or cold di sumagot hahaha. Since ayun tumanggi sa coffee, Sabi ko food nalang and Sabi niya na may food Naman Sila. Di na ako nag insist pa, well Yun yung decision niya ehhh hehe. After nun tinanong ko parin sa cashier kung pwede ako manlibre sa Isang staff and binulungan niya manager niya and Sabi sa akin di pwede. Ayun back down na ako. 

Ang funny lang Kasi si cashier kabisado na niya order ko hahaha. After paying umalis narin ako sa shop and I passed through Ms. Barista without saying Hi or any word. Yun lang epic fail ako pero that's ok hahaha. I guess company policy lang din talaga. 

Ayun lang, I hope na lighten up ko yung mood here sa subreddit and I wish Ms. Barista well. Thank you sa kanya Kasi ayun may unting bundle of joy ako while going through that event hahahaha. Ang awkward Ng last interaction pero ayun I wish her well sa life niya. To you Ms. Barista, I hope nababasa mo ito if ever hehehe. 

See you around nalang din and I wish you well in life.

I just moved out of ANOTHER house because of a weirdo roommate (stole stuff, never cleaned, lied to landlord) and I JUST quit my other job because of an overt narc manager (who everyone at the job was aware of but couldn't fire because of staff shortage), to just now move in with ANOTHER overt narc.

  
I have to vent and don't need much advice as I have become very well-read on how to deal with these people, but I mainly just want to blow off major steam. 

Ever since I moved in, I noticed this guy took issue with me. He always interrupts when I speak, always turns the conversation back to him, strokes his own ego nearly every time he starts talking, always disagrees with whatever I have to say (even if it's an arbitrary fact, like ""the sky is blue""), oh and obvious gaslighting when he is caught blatantly lying. Not only to me, but obviously to most women of the house he speaks very condescendingly. Always giving unsollicited advice, explaining stuff you didn't ask for, taking stupid argument points to start discussions, laughing at you for doing something as dumb as cutting garlic, yadiya.

He, however, tends to have a special obsession with me at the same time (probably since I'm the newest in the house), where he will try to get as much alone-time with me as possible, and he is SET on asking me uncomfortable questions, or wants to know right around everything about me and my bf. He is also in the common areas 24/7 like he is just WAITING for people to walk in so he can yap their ears off, and will absolutely ignore if you are wearing headphones or are in a hurry. He will even act offended when you do not take your headphones off to fall into his dumb conversation-traps. 

One time when I was in the living room enjyoing my morning coffee with my boyfriend in silence, he had to interrupt to start bashing me about a book I had borrowed. It was such a dead-end conversation, where I literally told him multiple times I will give his book back right now if needed (it was in my room and I quite literally had not touched it). I did not look up from my phone and neither did my bf. Yet he had to go on a rampage about how ""you should have made time to read it"" and ""if you don't want it I can give it to someone else blah blah"".

There are other times where he insists on making me incredibly uncomfortable with sexual questions when I am alone. Asking me questions such as if I have found the majority of men that I have slept with to be more dominant/submissive (obviously to segway into how he is the total package by possessing a bit of both), or if women read erotic books as their form of self-pleasure (yes, he has actually asked this and way, way worse). When I opened up to my roommates about a serious inappropriate situation between me and a coworker, he turned to conversation to him. Whenever someone is having a conversation that does not involve him he HAS to interrupt in any way shape or form (starting to loudly read passages from his stupid bible-sized book, playing music loudly, or just interrupting in general).

My house is a 13-student flat on a university campus and is otherwise super close. House name, traditions, eating dinner together etc. So it's not really a matter of ""just be on your own"" (although that is what I am doing the majority of the time). We have to be semi-social and organise stuff together. As such, the guy has a whole social dynamic to put his insecure claws into and stir up drama. He shit talks roommates, sets really dumb narratives, always laughing behind people's backs, lies about others. Organising something is a literal hell because if I happen to be the one doing it he gets jealous and has to undermine any decision-making or ideas. And somehow - eventhough a lot of roommates have expressed their annoyance about him- he is still able to make an impression because he is JUST so OVERTLY convincing in how wrong he is. He just spews bullshit with no second thought, and I guess that is what always somewhat makes an impact. Also, a lot of people just don't think fighting him is worth the headache, since it gives him the attention he desperately craves.

  
Anyways, no I do not want to move out (and financially this is just not an option). I have to stay here for like, minimum a year but luckily my bf lives walking distance. So far, my tactics just consist of grey-rocking him when I'm alone with him, and ignoring his attempts to stir up debates. I'm also taking a short mental crash-course in regaining some self-trust. If you have any valuable advice from similar situations, feel free to share. But please understand I can not do anything drastic like completely isolate myself

1lndaxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lndaxd/where_the_dead_things_bloom_romantically/,Where the dead things Bloom [Romantically Apocalyptic Systemfall Litrpg]. Ch 1: Doggored,"Death came as a series of sensations rather than a singular moment as water filled my lungs.

My wrists struggled against the zip ties as I thrashed and yelled, instinct overriding the knowledge that no one would hear, no one would come. The sicarios had picked this old, semi-abandoned, forsaken apartment complex, as a place where a man could disappear in the night without witness.

I remember him looming over me before they pushed me under, a lieutenant with ""Santa Muerte"" tattooed across his throat, face pockmarked from old acne and adorned with teardrop tattoos cascading from his left eye. The gangster's shaved head gleamed under the bathroom's old, dim light bulb, revealing further art of elaborate crosses and Catholic saints that disappeared beneath the collar of his button-up.

His breath reeked of tequila and carne asada as he leaned close. ""Your brother should've paid El Jefe what he owed,"" he told me moments ago, pressing a gold-plated Desert Eagle my temple ""La familia pays for familia. Always.""

A platinum front tooth with a tiny embedded diamond glinted as his lips twisted into an uncaring smile. I hadn't spoken to my brother in three months, I hadn't even known that he got himself tangled with Los √Åguilas until they'd kicked through my door and dragged me from my apartment at 3 AM.

As I told the Los √Åguilas, I had no idea where my brother was, he was likely spending the money gambling, completely unaware or uncaring that his debts had caught up to me. My pleas meant nothing to them, and I couldn't possibly pay them what he owed, since I was just a university student with far too much debt hanging over me.

They took their time with the drowning. Made it a ghastly ritual. Four of them crowded into the moldering bathroom, passing a bottle of Clase Azul between them, placing casual bets on how long I'd last. The youngest one, barely eighteen with a face unmarked by tattoos, his eyes hollow and dead was recording everything on his phone.

""Para tu hermano,"" he explained, a heavy gold crucifix swinging around his neck. ""So he knows what happens when you don't pay up.""

The first submersion was brief. It introduced me to the panic, to the burning in my lungs. They pulled me up, allowed me a desperate gulp of air that tasted of mildew and fear. The lieutenant laughed as they pushed me under again. The second time lasted longer. Black spots danced at the edges of my vision as I thrashed and fought for air. My body convulsed against the restraints, animal instinct fighting against the inevitable. By the third time, something inside me had begun to break.

When they shoved me under for the final time, the lieutenant's ring-covered fingers gripping my hair, my movements grew weaker. All I could think of in that moment was how ordinary it felt to die in a random bathtub. How passe my erasure from the world would be. How little I accomplished at twenty-three.

I remember the moment my heart stopped.

Not darkness, as I always imagined it, but a strange, off-color, false illumination.

A message in silver sparks cascaded across the void, the text forming from nowhere:

**\[System integration commencing. Prepare for sub-reality nullspace re-calibration.\]**

Then another one.

**\[Absorption-phase of doomed world-matter into Systemfall boundary initiated. Please refrain from incoherent thought-panic. This is merely an update of your reality-space. Nothing to concern your linear consciousness with.\]**

The words appeared with the casual dismissiveness of a barista getting my name wrong for the fifth time. They burned themselves into what remained of my consciousness as I felt it spread outward from my failing body like ripples in the bathwater, touching everything, changing everything.

Then a progress **\[Loading ‚Ä¶0%\]** bar flashed into existence.

I died.

I knew that I died because people didn't survive drowning in bathtubs.

And yet, I did not die because I focused all of my will on the progress bar, desiring to exist, desiring to go on no matter what.

The **\[Loading‚Ä¶\]** progress bar somehow kept me alive, the percentage ticking up painfully slowly.

My body dissolved slowly, cell by cell, muscle and bone and skin surrendering to time and water.

I was conscious throughout, trapped in the liminal space between existence and nothingness. Time stretched and compressed around me like taffy pulled too thin, then folded back upon itself.

Silver sparks flickered through the darkness periodically, bringing new occasional messages:

**\[Attempting to reconstruct linear thought-form multicellular subject from bathtub smoothie. This might take a while. Have you considered becoming a potted plant-being instead? Much simpler data-signature.\]**

Then another one.

**\[Processing organic matter-forms... Fascinating discovery of microbiome ecosystems within your digest-tube. We are designating the most interesting specimens as protected thought-entities. They have been given designation-names.\]**

And later still: **\[Rebuilding identity-cores and memory-webs... Encountered significant emotional-trauma debris fields. Preserving them despite inefficiency protocols. Your existence-baggage remains intact. Most Installers would recommend deletion, but we respect your attachment to your thought-form patterns.\]**

Each message carried the same tone of some irate, weary alien consciousness that seemed to have been assigned this resurrection duty as punishment for some unfathomable cosmic infraction.

**\[Reform sequence nearing completion-state. Enjoy your second-chance existence. You're welcome.\]**

Then came the blooming.

It began with a tingling at what had once been my brain, a gathering of matter and memory. I desperately clung to my identity, resisting slipping away into the abyss with every bit of my consciousness that I still wielded. My name. My memories. My absolute sense of self.

The small scar on my left thumb from when I was seven. The way coffee tasted on Sunday mornings. The precise color of sunset through my apartment window. My grandfather‚Äôs Siberian Husky dog Nessy who rescued me from nearly drowning in the Ferguson Quarry Lake when I was thirteen. I clung to these details with ferocious intensity, refusing to be subsumed, refusing to become merely another element in this cosmic reshuffling.

My flesh reconstructed itself, not from the soup of my remains that had mixed with the filthy water, but from something other, outsidery, eldritch, a thing that carried echoes of what I had been long ago. Yet within that vile process, I forced my particularity into each reforming cell. I was not simply a human being remade from cosmic dust, I was *me*, with all my flaws and features, my personal history and hurts.

I watched with gradually reforming flower-eyes as I bloomed from the bath like some terrible flower, particles of myself coalescing, reforming, becoming solid once more. With every moment in the state between life and death, I fought to retain my essence, to keep the core of my identity intact as time mercilessly marched on and on.

Nerves, muscles, ligaments, organs. It all grew from the bath-soup with unnerving, horrid slowness.

When awareness returned fully, I found myself naked, lying in a rotting bath. The porcelain was cracked and stained with rust-colored residue I didn't want to identify. Black mold crept across the ceiling and walls in fractal patterns. The air smelled of mold, of plants, rot, and something... horribly wrong, like myriads of mundane flavors entwined together into one.

I pulled myself up on trembling legs, skin slick with whatever fluid had birthed me back into the world. My reflection in the cracked mirror above the sink showed a face I recognized as mine.

Brown hair, green-brown eyes, a stubble.

Just like I used to be. Except I wasn‚Äôt me, more like an idea of me that manifested back into physical existence‚Ä¶ long, long after I died. I pushed the horrid memories of my reconstruction away.

The human mind was good at ignoring inconvenient things, effective at forgetting traumatic experiences.

The abandoned apartment was a mess. Nature had begun to reclaim it. Vines crept through cracks in the walls. Patches plastic-looking moss that glistened with violet iridescence covered portions of the floor.

I searched the rooms, slowly moving on unsteady legs that remembered how to walk only through muscle memory, trying hard not to step on broken glass or a rusty nail. In what had once been a maintenance closet, I found a construction uniform, dirty orange coveralls with silver stripes a faded G logo on it. The fabric felt unnervingly rough my new skin, but the outfit gave me anchor to the human I had been long ago. The muddy boots sitting below the uniform were a tad too big for my feet, but I pulled them on regardless, lacking any other options.

I refused to think of myself as a thing that bloomed from a bathtub. I was a man and that was that.

Departing from the gloomy, dark apartment I entered the city.

The city‚Ä¶ had seen better days.

Buildings sagged, windows gaped like empty eye sockets, and the streets had buckled and cracked, giving way to something that could only loosely be called vegetation.

Try as I might, I could not remember its name. Perhaps, I had spent so much time focusing on myself I had completely forgotten some things. Not like it mattered, because the city was gone, dead, hollowed out.

Trees grew everywhere, but they weren't the ordinary kind.

They were‚Ä¶ aberrations, inorganic yet organic sculptures composed of whatever they had bloomed from. A streetlight had sprouted branches that bore fruit resembling small glowing orbs. A taxi cab had given birth to a massive trunk, its yellow paint still visible in patches along the distorted surface, with branches that terminated in leaves made from side-view mirrors.

I stood motionless on the crumbling steps of the apartment complex, the reality of this new world washing over me in waves of panic. The System had changed everything. And somehow, impossibly, I had been reborn into the heart of this transformation.

The taste of petrichor and electricity filled the still air.

In the distance, something odd moved between the freakish trees through the murky tendrils of fog rolling low across the ground.

At first, I thought it was a human‚Äîthe silhouette suggested shoulders, a head, the familiar bipedal gait.

Hope tangled in my chest as I watched it approach.

That hope died quickly.

The thing that emerged onto the broken pavement was shaped like a female human but assembled wrong, as if whatever had created it had only seen humans from a distance and through fog. Its proportions were subtly distorted‚Äîarms too long, neck too flexible. Where a face should have been, features like eyes and mouths shifted and rearranged themselves in nauseating patterns, like wet clay being constantly remolded by invisible fingers.

In its hands, it clutched a rusted stop sign, wrenched from some forgotten intersection. The red octagon had faded to the color of dried blood, and the metal pole had snapped, leaving a jagged, lethal, rust-covered point.

It was wearing a dirty and sliced up mechanic's blue coveralls.

It saw me. Or sensed me. Whatever passed for perception in that writhing face seemed to lock onto my presence.

I should have run. That would have been the smart thing to do‚Äîflee back into the rotting apartment building, find somewhere to hide until this aberration lost interest and shambled away.

But my body rooted itself to the spot. There was no fight or flight in me at that moment, only pure, liquid dread.

The monstrous humanoid charged, moving with a stuttering, glitch-like motion. The stop sign whistled through the air as it swung the improvised weapon toward my body.

I tried to dodge, but it was far too late.

The jagged edge of the stop sign caught me across the abdomen, tearing through the orange coveralls and my body beneath. Pain exploded like white fire as the metal sliced deep, parting skin and muscle with horrifying ease. I felt something warm and wet spill down my front, watched in disbelief as loops of intestine threatened to escape the wound.

**\[Health: 80% | Reconstitution: 100%\]**

Silver text flashed in my field of vision, helpfully quantifying the damage.

Even as I registered the numbers, I felt a strange tingling at the site of the wound. Gasping and spitting blood, I watched as my spilling insides suddenly took on root-like properties, veins and blood blossoming into mushroom and mold-like forms. Flesh-roots rapidly weaved themselves through the gash, pulling tissue together, stemming the flow of blood.

The numbers flashed, rapidly changing to:

**\[Health: 81% | Reconstitution: 99%\]**

The creature gurgled with annoyed static, drawing my attention back to it.

""What the fuck are you?"" I gasped, retreating across the cracked concrete.

The female-shaped thing made disturbing, twisted sounds punctuated by fragments of human speech, letting out disjointed syllables and phonemes that never came together into coherent words.

Its not-quite-face rippled with what might have been curiosity, or hunger. The features continued to shift and flow, occasionally forming recognizable expressions‚Äîseduction, fascination, cruelty, joy‚Äîbefore dissolving back into a horrid mess of shifting flesh. It tilted its head, seemingly intrigued by my healing ability, a multitude of colorful eyes blossoming across its head.

It advanced towards me as I retreated, distracted by numbers flashing in my vision.

**\[Health: 82% | Reconstitution: 98%\]**

The thing swung again, the stop sign arcing toward my midsection speed. This time I was ready, sidestepping and grabbing the pole as it passed. The rusted metal bit into my palms, drawing blood.

The cut slowly resealed itself.

**\[Health: 80% | Reconstitution: 97%\]**

We struggled over the weapon, a perverse tug-of-war that sent us staggering across the debris-strewn street. The creature's strength was inhuman. It wasn't simply stronger than me, but wrong, as if it could selectively ignore the physics that bound my muscles and tendons to their limitations.

Up close, its wrongness was even more apparent. Its skin had the texture of wax left too close to a flame, and beneath the surface, millions of silver, worm-like shapes moved and pulsed like fish swimming beneath ice. It smelled of ozone and rot and something sweet and cloying that reminded me of overripe fruit left to ferment in the sun.

With a violent twist, the creature suddenly wrenched the stop sign sideways, snapping my wrist with a wet crack. Pain exploded up my arm as bone fragments pierced skin.

**\[Health: 75% | Reconstitution: 96%\]**

Mushroom-roots bloomed and pulsed at the wound site with silver radial shimmers, my shattered bones knitting together even as I screamed and swore.

The creature tilted its not-head, a moment of curiosity rippling across its features. It struck again, the jagged edge of the stop sign shearing through my shoulder and nearly severing my arm.

**\[Health: 69% | Reconstitution: 95%\]**

My arm hung by threads of muscle and tendon, but already the Reconstitution bullshit was working, reconnecting tissue, rebuilding what had been destroyed.

The creature made that static-noise again.

It advanced methodically, the stop sign dripping with my blood. It swung again, and this time the metal connected with my ribs, caving in my chest cavity with a sound like wet kindling breaking.

**\[Health: 47% | Reconstitution: 94%\]**

I collapsed to the ground, air bubbling through the ruins of my lungs. The flesh-roots worked frantically, rebuilding my shattered sternum, reinflating punctured organs. The pain was beyond comprehension, not just the agony of injury, but the alien sensation of being unmade and remade simultaneously.

The creature loomed over me, its face-space parting to reveal a spiral of glass-like, transparent, misshapen teeth. It dropped the stop sign and plunged one hand directly into my chest, fingers elongating into knife-like protrusions.

**\[Health: 35% | Reconstitution: 93%\]**

I felt it rooting around inside me, fingers probing my insides, likely questing for a way to finally put me out of my misery.

Then with a snag and rip of tearing flesh, I saw the monstrous thing holding my heart. It held my heart in its claws and yet I somehow wasn't dead.

It crushed my heart spraying me in blood.

People definitely didn't survive without hearts.  
  
**\[Health: 0% | Reconstitution: 82%\]**  


That should have been that. Yet, I was somehow still alive. Alive without a heartbeat.

Suspended between life and death. Conscious. Aware of being carved apart.

Its other hand reached for my face, fingers stretching toward my eyes. Through the haze of pain and horror, I saw the stop sign lying just within reach.

Reconstitution ticked down while my health ticked up.  
  
**\[Health: 12% | Reconstitution: 77%\]**

As the creature's claws pressed against my face, beginning to sink into the soft tissue, I lunged sideways, receiving a few cuts across the face.

My hand closed around the blood-covered metal pole. The creature, distracted by its dig through my internal organs, didn't react in time as I swung the jagged end into the side of its head.

The improvised spear punched through its temple. There was resistance, then a giving way‚Äînot the wet, organic yield of flesh being pierced, but something odd, like pushing through layers of static electricity.

The thing above me convulsed, its hand still buried wrist-deep in my abdomen.  


**\[Health: 13% | Reconstitution: 76%\]**

With the last reserves of my strength, I pushed with both of my arms, driving the steel handle deeper, twisting it like a key in a lock.

The monstrous thing went rigid, vibrating at a frequency that made my vision blur. A high-pitched keening filled the air, an eldritch sound that seemed to exist simultaneously inside and outside my head.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

**\[Health: 29% | Reconstitution: 60%\]**

I hissed, gurgling blood, watching as Reconstitution ticked down while my Health ticked up.

**\[Health: 31% | Reconstitution: 58%\]**

I pulled the stop sign out of the hole in the thing's head, ready to strike again, if it healed itself like me.

It did not.

Instead, the body of my enemy began to crystallize from the head down, the grotesque features freezing into a mask that resembled a dozen faces screaming in unison. The process spread downward, immobilizing its torso, its arms‚Äîincluding the one still partially embedded in my ruined abdomen.

With a final, desperate heave, I tore myself free from the crystallizing limb, feeling pieces of myself ripping away in the process. I collapsed beside the now-statue-like form, panting.

**\[Health: 32% | Reconstitution: 57%\]**

Slowly and painfully my flesh repaired itself. Bones knit together with audible cracks, organs resealed themselves, muscle and skin rewove themselves in bewildering patterns.

I could feel my strength returning, my vitals stabilizing, my form back to something approaching wholeness.

For a few minutes, I lay there beside my crystallized attacker, watching the gloomy sky intersected by monstrous, concrete-textured roots stretching between tilted buildings. The status indicators flickered one final time before stabilizing, utterly depleted of whatever power had saved me.

**\[Health: 89% | Reconstitution: 0%\]**

Death had come for me once in a filthy bathtub. It had come again today on a broken street. Both times, I somehow managed to refuse its embrace.

I looked at my body. It was covered in colorful bruises and dark scars, aching all over.

As I stared at the final reading, a new dread settled over me. I had no idea how‚Äîor if‚Äîthis Reconstitution power could be recharged.

I touched my healed stomach, feeling the phantom pain of organs being ripped out. If I encountered another of these creatures, I would have no miraculous healing to save me.

I pulled myself to my feet, staring at the crystallized, female-ish form of my attacker. Today I survived by the narrowest of margins. Tomorrow, if there was a tomorrow for me, I would need to be smarter.

This new, System-controlled world was clearly out to murder me.

Suddenly, new silver text flickered into existence inside my eyes.

**\[Congratulations on a successful termination of‚Ä¶ \_a LV 10 Unrefined Conceptoid. These half-formed thought-entities often develop aggressive tendencies during transition periods. Your efficient disposal is noted and appreciated.\]**

I wiped blood from my hands, staring at the message.

**\[Clearance points allocated. Random reward generation initiated.\]**

A triangular-shaped symbol materialized above the corpse, composed of light that seemed to exist in more dimensions than it should as the text faded. It rotated slowly, undulating between different forms and possibilities, a human shape, then a weapon, a tool and myriads of other symbols I didn't have the energy or time to interpret.

I stared in bewilderment.

The symbol flickered more rapidly, then stopped on a simple icon: two humanoid silhouettes standing side by side‚Äìone pink, the other blue.

**\[Category randomly generated: Companion.\]** The text returned.

""Companion?"" I repeated. ""Like... another person?""

**\[Please state desired companion concept parameters.\]**

My mind raced through possibilities.

Who would I want beside me in this nightmare world? My thoughts turned first to people I had known‚Äîfriends, family, girls I dated‚Äîbut each face that rose in my memory came with complications, with betrayals both small and large.

My brother's cruel smirk appeared unbidden, and anger flared across me, hot and immediate. He was the reason I had died, his debts becoming my death sentence. No, not him. Never him.

I thought of others; My coworkers, neighbors, even the barista who had smiled at me every morning for three years without ever learning my name. But trust... trust was the issue. Who could I trust in a world gone mad? Who had I ever really trusted?

Not my parents who constantly forgot that I existed, picking my brother as their favorite and showering him with their love and presents while taking my things away.

The answer came with sharp, brutal clarity: no one. No human, at least. Not even my grandfather who was kind to me once, but eventually drowned himself in alcoholism and gradually descended into Alzheimer's ranting about System Wizards.

But there had been Nessy, my grandfather's Siberian Husky. The black and white fuzzball who had pulled me from Ferguson Quarry Lake when I was thirteen. Who had always slept at the foot of my bed, who had listened to my adolescent problems without ever judging me.

A dog couldn't betray you or deceive you. A dog's loyalty was simpler, purer than any complicated human connection. A dog‚Äôs agenda was to follow the alpha, to take care of the pack. A dog could sniff out food, help me find much needed sustenance in these desolate ruins, warn me if something monstrous was coming ahead of time with a growl.

""A dog,"" I said aloud. ""Just like my grandfather's husky. One that can help me survive out here. One I can trust. Nessy! Bring her back if you can, just like you brought me back!‚Äù

The Companion symbol pulsed once, brightly, then reformed into the silhouette of a canine head. For a moment, I felt a flicker of relief‚Äîsomething familiar in this utterly alien landscape. I held my breath, hoping to get back someone that I loved and lost.

Then the symbol exploded in a shower of silver particles that rained down on the crystalline remains of the conceptoid.

The ossified, crystalline body cracked like an egg, splitting open with a blinding flash that made me stagger backwards.

When I blinked, clearing my throbbing vision, something‚Ä¶ else was there, filling the blue coveralls.

Not a dog, but a girl‚Äîno, not quite a girl either. She rose from the shattered shell of the creature I had killed, shaking off sparkling, fading eggshell-like remnants like a dog shaking off water after a swim.

She was humanoid‚Ä¶ but clearly not entirely human.

White and black fur covered her entire body in patterns reminiscent of a husky's markings. Her face was an unsettling combination of human and canine features‚Äîdark nose, a shortened muzzle, pointed, fluffy, dark ears that swiveled atop her head, long locks of hair that started pure black at the top and turned pure white when they reached her shoulders.

I stared at her, speechless.

*This wasn't what I had asked for. This wasn't what I had wanted at all!*

**\[Companion procured based on user desire and available conceptoid strata. Companion designation: Nessy.\]** The System notified me.

""Hey! This isn't what I meant,"" I said. ""I wanted a dog! An actual dog. Not whatever this fu...""

The dog-girl‚ÄîNessy, apparently‚Äîtilted her head in a gesture so canine it was jarring on her humanoid frame. She stared at me with wide, brilliant, blue eyes.

Then she lunged at me with startling speed, knocking me backward onto the broken pavement before I could react. My head cracked against the rubble, pain blooming bright and sharp at the base of my skull and all over me as the conceptoid stop-sign-made injuries throbbed madly.

""Alec! ALEC!"" she yelped, her voice human with a sprinkle of canine excitement. Her weight pinned me down as she frantically licked at my face, wide tongue slathering saliva against my skin. ""You're back! You're back! I found you!""

Her white paws‚Äîhands?‚Äîscrabbled at my shoulders, claws catching on the fabric of the borrowed orange coveralls. The proximity of her inhuman, uncanny face to mine sent panic surging through me. I pushed against her chest, struggling to create distance between us.

""Ow, owww, shit, damn it, get off me!"" I shouted, dropping the stop sign and finally managing to shove her aside. I scrambled, backing away with my hands raised defensively. ""Stay back!""

Nessy froze, her pointed ears flattening against her skull. Those piercing blue eyes‚Äîso familiar yet alien in her face‚Äîwidened with hurt and confusion. She rapidly retreated away from me, hunched over, her posture suddenly submissive.

""Why are you mad at me?"" she whimpered. ""Don't you recognize me? Oh, you‚Äôre hurt.‚Äù She noticed my bruises and scratches. ‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶ I got too excited. I‚Äôve been looking for you for so long and‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped her saliva from my face with the back of my hand, trying to steady my breathing.

""You're not... this isn't what I asked for!"" I growled, slowly rising. ""I wanted an actual dog! A normal husky. Not... whatever the hell you are!‚Äù

Her head tilted in confusion, a gesture so fundamentally canine that for a moment, I could almost see the idea of the companion I'd intended to create, the memory of my best friend from my childhood.

""But I am a dog,"" she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. She gestured to herself with a fur-covered white hand that ended in black claws. ""See? Dog!‚Äù

""No, you're not, damn it!"" I growled. ""Dogs don't talk. And they certainly don't stand on two legs or have... Fuzzy hands with pink paw pads. Ugh.""

‚ÄúSince when do you not like my paw pads‚Ä¶‚Äù she began and then something horrid howled in the foggy street sounding like a fax fused to a thousand pigeons. Something moved across the rubble with the sound of tapping feet. Too many feet for my liking.

Both of us froze, looked at each other and then rapidly retreated into the nearby shop, ducking behind a cracked wall.

The tapping of legs sounded closer. I peered through a crack in the wall.

Something vast and lanky shambled through the fog, its form only partially visible.

It looked like someone had grafted a municipal playground onto the body of a monstrous, hollow insect. A central dome made from a children's playground carouse rotated slowly at the creature's center, peeling, green and orange paint visible. From this central hub extended dozens of jointed legs made from playground slides, each segment connected by bulbous joints. The legs clicked against the pavement in an irregular rhythm that set my teeth on edge.

A twisted jungle gym formed a cage-like structure housing what looked like hundreds of swinging tire swings that pulsed like organs. Each ""tire"" contained a glowing amber substance that cast sickly light through the fog. The entire abomination moved with an unnatural grace, pivoting on its many legs as it seemed to search for something to snack on.

Nessy‚Äôs clawed hand dug into mine as both of us tried not to breathe.

We remained frozen as the creature pivoted slowly, its carousel body rotating with a faint, discordant melody that sounded like a corrupted music box. After what felt like an eternity, it resumed its clicking progress down the street, disappearing back into the fog.

""We should go,"" I whispered when the sounds had faded. ""Before it comes back.""

‚ÄúGo where, Alec?‚Äù Nessy asked, her canine ears swiveling left and right. ""I don‚Äôt think that anywhere is particularly safe now. The System keeps creating new horrors by fusing things to things.""

I gave her a look.

*I didn't tell her my name. How did she know my name?*

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a thing the System created,‚Äù I pointed out.

‚ÄúWhat?! No I am not!‚Äù She insisted.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dog-human,‚Äù I said.

""I'm a dog!"" Nessy insisted, her fluffy black and white tail twitching with agitation. ""I've always been a dog! I‚Äôm not like that‚Ä¶ living playground thing. We went to high school together Alec! We had English class together at Ferguson High!""

The name of the school hit me like another physical blow.

*Ferguson High‚Äîwhere I'd gone as a teenager.*

""Ferguson High didn't have any... dog-people,‚Äù I whisper-hissed. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as dog people. You‚Äôre the first dog-person I‚Äôve met!‚Äù

""Yeah, sure. Next you'll tell me President Roosevelt didn't have his famous Scottish Terrier advisor during the New Deal,"" she rolled her eyes.

""Roosevelt had a dog named Fala, but it was a pet. It didn't advise him on policy!"" I pointed out.

Nessy's dark tail with a white tip swished behind her, cutting through the air with indignation. ""What are you talking about? Fala was Secretary of the Treasury! There's that famous photograph of him wearing those tiny glasses while reviewing economic policy."" She growled. ""Everyone knows that!""

I pressed my palms against my temples, trying to make sense of her words. The world had already transformed beyond recognition‚Äîbuildings reclaimed by unnatural vegetation, streets buckled and broken, strange conceptoid creatures that offered rewards upon death, yet somehow this conversation felt like the most surreal aspect of my resurrection.

""Let me get this straight,"" I said, lowering my hands. ""You think... that you knew me in high school? That we took English together?""

""Of course!"" Nessy's ears perked up, her mood shifting with canine quickness. ""You sat two rows behind me. You always smelled like those peanut butter sandwiches your mom made that you pawned off to me."" Her nose twitched at the memory. ""And you were terrible at literature. I helped you study for midterms junior year!‚Äù

The details were oddly specific, yet completely wrong. I had indeed been terrible at literature, and my mother had packed those awful peanut butter sandwiches I hated, but there had been no dog-girl Nessy at Ferguson High.

I found myself staring at the white angel-wing markings that swept across her forehead‚Äîidentical to the ones on my grandfather's husky forehead fur pattern. My chest tightened with a sudden, visceral memory: seeing these wings visible through murky quarry water as teeth closed around my clothes, dragging my unresponsive body toward the surface, toward life.

*My guardian angel.*

Nessy fidgeted under my scrutiny, her too-human hands nervously smoothing the matted fur of her arms. She was undeniably pretty, the crystalline ocean-blue of her eyes, the dark nose, the canid-human face, her fit, curvy body wrapped in fur that transitioned from midnight black to pristine white. However, she was beautiful in the way a porcelain doll is beautiful‚Äîflawless, idealized, and also‚Ä¶ utterly wrong, surreal, impossible just like the playground-centipede.

""What do you remember about the quarry,"" I said suddenly, unable to stop myself. ""About what happened there when I was thirteen?""

Nessy's expression softened. She rocked on her clawed feet. ""You fell in,"" she said simply. ""You were showing off, walking along that concrete ledge where everyone went cliff-diving in the summer. You slipped and hit your head on the way down."" Her eyes momentarily clouded with the memory. ""I jumped in after you. Pulled you all the way to the beach a few hundred feet away. Almost freaking drowned myself since you kept clinging to me so hard.""

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. The events matched exactly what had happened, but with one vital difference‚Äîit was an ordinary dog, who dragged me from the water while the rest of my ‚Äòfriends‚Äô did fuck all to help me.

""And then what?"" I pressed. ""After you pulled me out?""

""Your grandfather drove us to the hospital,"" she continued, the words spilling out with pure, absolute conviction. ""Doc Flanaghan‚Äîyou remember him, that old, balding bloodhound?‚Äîhe gave you three stitches in your forehead."" She reached out as if to touch my hairline where the scar had been. I flinched away instinctively.

""Doc Flanaghan was human,"" I said.

Nessy blinked rapidly, her head tilting first one way then the other. ""Are you feeling okay, Alec? Hrmmm."" She sniffed the air, nostrils flaring. ""You smell‚Ä¶ like you. You‚Äôre hurt though. You must have hit your head and now you‚Äôre confused. Are you concussed?""

""I'm not the one who's confused,"" I snapped, frustration boiling over. ‚ÄúYou're confused! Stop confusing me with this dog-world nonsense! This bloody place is confusing enough!‚Äù

Nessy regarded me with concern that made her look disconcertingly like a kindergarten teacher dealing with a difficult child.

""Alec,"" she said slowly, ""dogs and humans have always lived side by side. Worked together. Gone to school together. For thousands of years, since humans began to adopt wild wolves!""

""No,"" I insisted, ""they haven't.""

""Oh really?"" She crossed her arms. ""Then who was the first dog astronaut to walk on the moon alongside Neil Armstrong? Everyone knows it was Kira Pawstrong! There's that famous quote: 'One small step for man, one giant leap for canine-kind.'""

I stared at her. In her eyes, I could see absolute certainty‚Äîthese weren't lies she was telling, but memories she genuinely believed. Memories of another, absurd world of humanoid dogs.

""Next you're going to tell me that Shakespeare was a dog?"" I chortled.

""William Shakespeare?"" Nessy's tail wagged slightly. ""Nah. He was a human. Mrs. Abernathy had us read 'Romeo and Juliet' junior year. 'Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona where we lay our scene...'"" She recited the opening lines perfectly. ""Classic tale of love between a human boy and a collie girl from feuding families.""

I couldn't help it‚Äîa slightly hysterical laugh escaped me. ""Romeo and Juliet were both human!""

""No, no, no,"" Nessy insisted, wagging a clawed finger at me. ""You're thinking of 'Hamlet,' which was all humans. 'Romeo and Juliet' was specifically about the tensions between human and canine communities in medieval Italy. It's Shakespeare's most famous exploration of species-based prejudice!‚Äù She declared and then looked past me, sniffing the air.

‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶ I'm so done with this conversation,‚Äù I sighed.

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶okay?‚Äù She asked.

""As okay as I can be after dying horribly and fermenting in a bathtub for weeks,"" I let out.

Nessy's ears svivelled back, her blue eyes widening with horror. ""You‚Ä¶ What?!""

""I was murdered. Drowned in a bathtub by cartel gangsters looking for my brother."" I revealed. ""I died, and this... System came.""

The dog-girl stared at me with a shocked expression.

""The System reconstituted me,"" I continued. ‚ÄúRebuilt me. Molecule by molecule. Like the Ship of Theseus.""

Nessy studied me, her head tilting in that distinctly canine way. Her nostrils flared as she processed my scent, seemingly searching for truth. Seconds stretched into a full minute of silence.

""We didn't go to high school together. You're not real‚Äînot in the way you think you are,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou're‚Ä¶ just something the System created when I killed a conceptoid thing five minutes ago.""

""No, no, no,"" she shook her head. ""I was the one who killed the conceptoid and made a wish on it to find you! Alec, it's me. It's Nessy. Your best friend!""

""My grandfather had a dog named Nessy,"" I stubbornly insisted, even though we were clearly at an impasse and starting to go in circles. ""A regular‚Ä¶ husky!‚Äù

‚ÄúI keep telling you, I‚Äôm a perfectly normal husky, Alec!‚Äù She showed me her fur-covered hands as if that proved anything.

‚ÄúIf the System didn‚Äôt make you, where did you come from?‚Äù I demanded.

""What do you mean, 'where did I come from'? Ferguson! I came from Ferguson! I've been searching for you for over a week!"" Her voice cracked.

I stared at her, contemplating the depths with which the System could generate a dog-person concept into existence by twisting my wish for a companion.

""I went to sleep in my apartment two weeks ago‚Ä¶ thinking about you finally coming back home to Fergus this summer,"" she said. ""Then, these silver words appeared floating in my eyes, waking me up. ‚Äò***System integration commencing. Prepare for reality recalibration***.‚Äô At first, I thought I was dreaming.""

I pursed my lips.

*Great. She had a backstory and everything.*

""Then these‚Ä¶ changes started when morning came. Slowly at first‚Äîdead things stopped decaying correctly. Then with each passing day‚Ä¶ more and more freaky weirdness seeped through the cracks, messed up reality. Gradually, the world became a little less familiar."" Her ears flattened at the memory. ""But the worst of it wasn't from the System‚Äîit was from people. People who... became freakishly strong or fast or fused with other... things. Then mass panic started, riots, fires, anarchy. Everyone turned on each other while the dead refused to stay dead and broken things fixed themselves in impossible ways, blooming like alien mushrooms and flowers.‚Äù

She exhaled.

‚ÄúThen the phone lines went down and I had no way of contacting you,‚Äù She shivered visibly. ""So I left Fergus, heading south. I drove until the road became impassable and then I ran for days‚Ä¶ almost a week, I think. Almost died in a junkyard. Been sleeping in abandoned buildings, scavenging for food, dodging gangs of looters and undead, freakish‚Ä¶ things. The whole time, I kept thinking about that Avicii animated music video we watched together‚Äîyou know, the one with the dog running through gunfire and explosions, desperately searching for her best friend after he was conscripted to go to war? That's how I felt. Like everything was falling apart around me, but I had to keep moving, ‚Äòcus no matter what‚Ä¶ had to find you!‚Äù

¬†

The Florida sky cracked open with gold and salmon light as the day began, and Koa stood barefoot at the edge of the dock, the boards cool and damp beneath him. The river had that glassy stillness that came before the morning tide. Out across the water, the old houseboat bobbed gently‚Äîits chipped paint now replaced with a warm honey glaze, wind chimes dancing from the awning, a tin pirate flag half-tangled on the rail. It had once been his hiding place. Now it belonged to Finn.

¬†

He heard the screen door creak and then slam softly behind him. Jess padded up next to him, a travel mug in her hand and sleep still curling in the corner of her smile.

¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs already out there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWoke up before six. Said he had to ‚Äòcheck the perimeter.‚Äô‚Äù

¬†

Koa chuckled. ‚ÄúYou create a clubhouse, you create a watchman.‚Äù

¬†

They stood together in silence for a while, the kind of quiet that comes not from emptiness but from comfort‚Äîten years of early mornings, coffee shared without needing words, and the long, hard-earned peace of being home.

¬†

Behind them stood their house, tall and sprawling with wraparound porches and river breezes forever moving through open windows. Shade Tree & Co. had started with a single leaky skiff and a handful of stubborn ideas, but now it was a name people knew. A brand. Koa still didn‚Äôt love the word ‚Äúbrand,‚Äù but he loved the smell of fresh-caught snapper in the ice bins and the sight of Finn sitting on the counter at the Saturday market, helping sell smoked mullet like a pro.

¬†

‚ÄúWe should fix the rope swing,‚Äù Jess said suddenly. ‚ÄúThe old one, off the cypress out back. I think he‚Äôs almost tall enough now.‚Äù

¬†

Koa looked over at her. ‚ÄúHe is.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI measured last week.‚Äù

¬†

She smiled again, smaller this time, and leaned into his shoulder.

¬†

From the houseboat, a whoop split the morning calm, and they both turned to see Finn leap from the stern, arms flung out like wings, disappearing with a splash.

¬†

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Koa muttered, already walking toward the dock ladder. ‚ÄúDid he even check for gators?‚Äù",1,1751199290.0,NewAuthor,1,1.0,False

1lnd8jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1lnd8jk/positive_sa_experience/,Positive SA experience,"I wanted to share my experience since the positive stories really helped me in the weeks leading up to my abortion.
It was my second SA abortion. Just being completely honest, my first SA abortion was really hard on me afterwards. Not because of losing the fetus related, but I gained a lot of medical anxiety afterwards. My PP did not offer any sedation and the only pain reliever we were given before was ibuprofen. When I found out I was pregnant again three years later, I was gutted. I never wanted to have a SA abortion again and the pill just didn‚Äôt sound like a fit for me either given the anxiety. So I researched my options.
I found a medical center out of my state that I reside in that offered full sedation. I knew this was the only way for me personally. I was 12 weeks.
I cried a lot the week leading up to my appointment, but I got it done yesterday and wow. All I feel is relief. I have no trauma from the experience. The people were great, took great care of me, comforted me the whole way. Made me feel like a whole person, made me laugh, all the things. I don‚Äôt remember a thing. I felt no pain. I woke up relaxed, went back to the hotel with my partner, and ate a real meal feeling good for the first time in three months.
I woke up this morning mentally lighter. Had a coffee again. Feeling good physically. Ready to heal and move on. 
The point of this is to share the positive and to research all the options. I didn‚Äôt know this would be an option for me and I only paid $750 which isn‚Äôt a huge jump in what I was quoted for a non-sedated route and worth every fricken penny for me personally.

This will live up in NYC,  in my SO's apartment.Got it on market place, second hand, but I can't see any indication that it's been ridden before. It's the Marino model which from my understanding is identical to the Urbano with the only difference being this has some different hardware that makes the bike rust resistant. It's a little cramped and flexy but I expected that from the design and price point. A gooseneck stem for a little more reach and some quick release metal pedals to eliminate the wobbly pedal strokes seem to be the only must-dos so far. I'm 6'1 and 220 for reference. 
Sadly, Starbucks is the only coffee shop open at 7:30am on a Sunday in my small town but at least we have that so I can't complain.

1lnd7sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1lnd7sx/observations_of_an_old_man/,Observations of an old man,"I woke up at 5:30AM this morning with an insight. the dots connected for me on a puzzling observation of mine. you know, one of those odd things you notice but not important enough to figure out right away. I decided to call it, an E.S.I. emotional support item. Everybody seems to have one. lucky coin, rabbits foot. good luck clothing item. things of the hard goods persuasion. But you also have the habit line of stuff. like those who can‚Äôt function unless they carry a pack of smokes with them everywhere they go. same thing with the people who always have a joint stashed on them somewhere. or a flask of something in their back pocket.

As I stared out my window watching the sun rise. I watched the morning ritual of the same people wandering around with their little pooch on a leash doing the morning bush watering. Then it dawned on me as I saw the dog hunker up and start dropping a load. How is this person going to pick up after her dog? She has the leash in one hand, and a cup of coffee in the other.

So every morning I look now and I see all these people wandering around with a cup in their hand. I have become obsessed! Everybody I see is always carrying something around with them. From bags to canes. cups of something to cigarettes hanging from their lips. Not to mention the constant cellphones in use. I would be hard pressed to find anyone without a damn phone on them. except me. Oh yes, I have one. but I never carry one with me. to me it seems goofy. probably because I‚Äôm old and there was always a phone booth damn near on every corner in town. To be honest, I hate the damn things. inevitably I will be right in the middle of doing something and that wretched thing will sound off demanding my attention. I pick up and it will be some sales person or robot call. Which only enrages me that much more. I guess I‚Äôm just one of those old farts from a bygone era that can‚Äôt quite adjust to changing times and the ways people behave.
