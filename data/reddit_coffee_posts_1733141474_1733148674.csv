1h4vsaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FieldsOfMistriaGame/comments/1h4vsaw/dae_find_the_girls_star_festival_dialogue_lacking/,DAE find the girls' Star Festival dialogue... lacking?,"Necessary disclaimer: FoM is becoming one of my favorite games. I love all the characters, esp the candidates. And yet...

I don't know if it's just me. I've watched all the Star Festival events with every candidate, and I just keep thinking that the guys' dialogue is just so much better?

Adeline has been my first choice for a while now. But I keep having the same issue with her: none of her heart events are very personal at all. I was hoping that the Star Festival would add some more flavor, tell us more about her, but it really doesn't. We know that Adeline feels immense pressure as the heir-- that's almost all we know about her, ever. I was hoping to know something deeper about her feelings? Maybe even feelings about being the heir over Eiland? Something about her family? Or other aspects of her character? Her Star Festival dialogue is short and fairly surface level, and your dialogue choices are very bland

Celine's and Reina's dialogue is definitely the best of the girls imo, and even then, I don't like them as much. Both show doubts about their abilities and life paths. You can comfort both of them vaguely and get vague happy responses in return, and then they're over. Again, fairly short with meh player dialogue choices, but better. I appreciated Reina wondering about leaving Mistria even briefly-- her family is so foundational to the town that this is an interesting thing for her to consider

Juniper's is... bad? I don't know what I expected, but not that? I guess it's okay, but the whole dialogue is like two jokes and a reference to vibrations. I would've liked Juniper to even say something like ""You know, not many ppl are able/allowed to talk like that to me. But you're the exception it seems"". Or idk, something that gives more context around her as a person, her experiences, etc. Very surface level, just fine

Valen's is again just fine. Her Star Festival dialogue doesn't really add anything, it just reiterates her heart events

Now, compare this to the Star Festival dialogue for the guys, and the difference is kinda staggering?

March, ofc, has great dialogue for the festival. I love his awkwardness. You get to ask about his family, and his response is really, really interesting: ""Olric and I didn't have time for that kind of thing growing up... Can we talk about something else?"" I'm immediately intrigued! What does that mean, March! It's a new nugget of information and gets me interested to know more about this aspect of his life/past. The dialogue options are still just okay, but they at least add more flavor

Balor has the most mid guys dialogue imo, and yet I still liked it more than half of the girls dialogue. Idk, it's more contemplative and whimsical? I especially love the line ""Now that you mention it... It is, isn't it? Wherever our paths take us in the next year... We can watch [the stars] together, as long as we both look up."" It's a great line and makes you feel more personally close with Balor. The vibes are great

Eiland's festival scene is my second favorite. You actually get to hear Eiland's thoughts on Adeline being the heir and how he fits into Mistria. He specifically says it wasn't a role he ever wanted, which is interesting! Was it one he was meant to have? His dialogue is just beautiful here too and his lines are great. ""I know that I'm always focusing on the past, but I can't shake the feeling that IS what I'm supposed to be doing. But sometimes I wonder if I'm just shying away from the future."" So good! his interest in history is also tied to his anxieties about the future. And ofc, I love ""It's funny, isn't it? Talking about this here, under these stars that bridge time"" ü©∑

Ryis has my favorite festival dialogue. While we already know Ryis is ofc from the Capital and there are things he loves and misses there (iced coffee for one), this scene fleshes this out more with her concerns about finding a home. You also directly relate to Ryis here, making you feel much closer! You're also new to Mistria and figuring out if this is home or not. And for me, my OC is from the Capital, which made it extra relatable. Idk, it's a personal, lovely scene that made me reconsider romancing Ryis over Adeline who is giving me nothing üò≠

And finally, the most surprising scene to me: Hayden. I won't lie, Hayden is my least favorite candidate. I like him, I do! I just don't think I ""get"" him, which is fine. But his scene was so solid here. I absolutely adored hearing about his time with his grandmother on the roof, and her doing the same with her dad. You learn Hayden wants a big family (hence all the animals), and you immediately get why that'd be important to him based on how he talks about his family. It's a really solid scene that made me like Hayden a whole lot more!

Idk, I was really looking forward to some solid scenes with the girls, esp the ones I'm considering romancing. But I found myself a hundred times more drawn to the guys scenes instead. I just feel like the girls needed more attention and to be more fleshed out. Tell me about Reina's feelings being the oldest sister, or how/why Celine came to love flowers so much! Let me ask about Juniper's past only to get laughed at! I feel like all the girls scenes were focused completely on self doubt (except Juniper, less so Valen ig) and the boys were allowed to really shine here. I just wanted more?

I'm curious to hear what other ppl think and if I'm the only one having this problem üòÖ",1,1733148589.0,FieldsOfMistriaGame,0,1.0,False

1h4vpwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1h4vpwt/rf_i_want_you_to_write_a_letter/,[RF] I Want You To Write A Letter,"Marla‚Äôs office is the small one at the end of the corridor. Just a room with a green oriental rug, two grey armchairs facing each other and a small desk off behind, near the window. On the same corridor there‚Äôs a charity that stopped trading years ago, but somehow inexplicably still keeps an office here, they‚Äôre never in of course. Then there‚Äôs the man with the folding bikes. He did a Kickstarter or something and the only thing you ever really see of him is when he goes to the kitchenette to fill the large pot he uses to brew the strong coffee. Then five or six times a day he‚Äôll scurry to the toilet and return to his lair. Then there‚Äôs the office with the ceiling tiles that all fell in, which I think is waiting for the day that the landlord has enough money to fix it up. Then, at the end, there‚Äôs Marla.

Marla likes her office because if you‚Äôre really charitable, or an estate agent, you can say that it has a river view. It doesn‚Äôt matter to Marla that you can only see the river if you actually physically press your face to the windows (which don‚Äôt open), or that if you even do this then all you‚Äôll see is a sorry, brown excuse for a river trudging by. That doesn‚Äôt matter to Marla. She says she can hear it and that running water is very important for a therapist because it carries the negative energy downstream. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì Marla‚Äôs not a flake, she‚Äôs a good therapist, but she‚Äôs fully invested in this idea about energy. But she‚Äôs not a flake.

Just outside Marla‚Äôs office are four plastic chairs grouped around a small coffee table, which has held the same copy of Elle since she started here. The magazine is picked up rarely but the quiz at the back has been filled in. Marla times her appointments so that there‚Äôs a good window between clients, you‚Äôd really have to be dawdling or keen to bump into another client. Marla knows that when it comes to therapists, people prefer anonymity, not just of her room, but of the building itself ‚Äì it feels like it‚Äôs one of those liminal spaces that people only really remember when they think really hard about it. For a therapist that‚Äôs good. If they needed to her clients can tell people they bump into outside the building that they were calling in on the charity, or buying a folding bike. Oh, is there a therapist up there too? Huh, I never knew.

Marla tries to treat the people she sees as individuals, she really does. But it would be wrong not to accept the truth that there are patterns. As a therapist, you have to try and fight that instinct to see the patterns and make judgements accordingly. Marla‚Äôs phrase to herself is that she needs to leave room to be surprised. One truth about therapy though is that people never really come when they‚Äôre well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to pre-emptively protect my mental health,‚Äù is not a sentence that Marla hears much in her working life. Her clients tend to come around when the shit is already working its way deep into the mechanisms of the fan. ‚ÄúI need to deal with my mental health,‚Äù is more the shape and size of things. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not been feeling very positive.‚Äù So, the first part of the pattern is that you can see that there is an inciting incident. He lost his job and it all went downhill from there. She had a baby and it‚Äôs never been the same since. They haven‚Äôt been the same since the accident/divorce/issue with the fence. There‚Äôs usually a spark.

The other thing that‚Äôs apparent if you sat where Marla does and saw the things she sees, is that the people tend to fit into a type. They have their inciting point and they have their shared characteristics. For lots of people it‚Äôs simply that they refuse to see the obvious problem. ‚ÄúBut, of course, you‚Äôre gay,‚Äù Marla has nearly said on a number of occasions. ‚ÄúYou are clinically depressed,‚Äù is another thing that remarkably few people realise about themselves. ‚ÄúYou should kill your mother,‚Äù Marla would like to say that more too, but she doesn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúMy mother said that she thought my new job was adequate for my sort of person, what do you think that means?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour mother is a narcissist and you could enter into an ill-fated series of therapy sessions and conversations with her, but ultimately it would be simpler, cheaper and probably better all round if you killed her.‚Äù

Marla didn‚Äôt say that, but she‚Äôd like to sometimes.

Then there are the treatment options. Often just listening is the majority of what Marla does. She hears the people and for the hour that she is with them she breathes and is calm and she really listens. She listens professionally. She notes things. She rarely makes notes these days because she‚Äôs perfected the art of listening and remembering ‚Äì but sometimes she does. She remembers these things so that she can point out things to her clients.

‚ÄúAnd of course Devon would be important to you because of the link with your father.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say you spread his ashes there?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, we did. Do you think that‚Äôs important here?‚Äù

People are not good listeners by nature and it‚Äôs getting worse. Try listening to someone while you‚Äôre also trying to complete that day‚Äôs Wordle ‚Äì it looks like it ends -TIC? Sorry did you say something about hitting someone with the car?

Marla likes her job. She‚Äôs good at her job. In-between sessions she presses the side of her face to the window and looks at the sliver of river she has access to. She blows out three good breaths and mists up the glass. The energy from that session goes downstream. She never really thinks about what is being delivered to her from upstream.

What Marla doesn‚Äôt like about her job can be summed up in seven words.

‚ÄúI want you to write a letter‚Ä¶‚Äù

She hates this part of her job because it always feels cheap. Like she‚Äôs pretending to be a therapist in a film. The writing a letter schtick is infuriating. It infuriates Marla, not because it doesn‚Äôt work, but because it does. With about 95% of her clients it proves to be one of the most effective interventions that she can do, other than being there, listening, remembering and using her brain.

‚ÄúA letter about what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to write a letter to your father/mother/uncle/abuser/teacher and I want you to be honest in that letter. I want you to bring it to our next session. During that session we can read through it together, or we can talk about the process of writing the letter, that‚Äôs up to you ‚Äì but I want you to write the letter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm no good at writing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì this is a letter that‚Äôs for you. It‚Äôs more important for you to get the feelings down on paper and to build some distance and objectivity from those feelings. Does that make sense?‚Äù

Of course, it always makes sense because people have seen this schtick in movies before. Marla¬†*hates*¬†that it works.

When they come to the next session, they usually seem brighter. Their shoulders are less slumped, the wattage of their smile has increased slightly, their eyes shine a little more. In their hand, or pocket, or bag they have a letter. Some of them are already in the envelope. Some of them are scrawled on line paper. Some are the work of amazing penmanship on blue, fragrant paper. Most are typed. Then they read the letter to Marla and talk about how it felt. They often cry and their voices catch as they do it. Marla gives them time. Gives them space to say these things. It‚Äôs rare that people fail in the task and if they do it then it‚Äôs rarer still that it doesn‚Äôt help. There‚Äôs just something primal about the power of trapping these feelings that have been sticking in their ribs, gumming up their lips for so long. It hslps to put these things into words and stick them to a page. Even reading and participating in the process makes Marla feel better ‚Äì curse it.

At the end of the session Marla gives the client an envelope and a stamp. Together they write down the address of the person who its direct at and they put a stamp in the corner. Marla then opens up an old mail sack that she took from the charity‚Äôs room and asks the client to imagine that they were going to the post box and they were going to actually deliver this letter. How would they feel if that was the case? Some of them shake. Others are happy, sometimes deliriously so. They cram that letter into the sack and stand up with pep in their step and glide in their stride. Damn it, Marla thinks ‚Äì it‚Äôs worked again. When the client has gone, she drags the sack into the corner of her room and folds over the mouth. In many ways that sack represents her legacy ‚Äì hundreds of clients that she has worked things through with ‚Äì not all of them were successes, but the letters nearly always helped.

Sometimes, like now, a client will cancel their session and Marla will walk over to the gym, or sometimes she‚Äôll drag the sack over to her desk and she‚Äôll lucky dip her hand into the sack and pluck out a letter. She can always remember the client, often she can remember the writing. The looped, cartoonish letters of Malcolm telling his long-dead mother that he was not gay, despite her being convinced that he was and disappointed that he wouldn‚Äôt live a fabulous and gay life. Sintha wracked with guilt at the loss of her baby, and laser-like fury with her husband for making her have the abortion. Marla holds them to her chest and then puts the letters back into the sack. She sometimes thinks that in the pantheon of great therapists her name might not be etched on a marble statue, but she is proud of what she has achieved at the end of her long corridor with its sliver of river and bag of letters.

Marla has very little notice that she‚Äôs dying. There‚Äôs a thump in her chest, which she thinks might be because she‚Äôs recently switched to almond milk in her tea and it gives her indigestion. She taps her breastbone to try and burp, but nothing comes up. There is a wash of heat that passes from one side of her chest to another. She coughs slightly and feels some discomfort. She thinks - maybe I pulled a muscle when I went to the gym earlier? And that‚Äôs it. Marla‚Äôs heart stops beating and she pants and her face strains and goes red and then she breathes out for the final time. It looks like we‚Äôve come to the end of our session.

The next client knocks on the door an hour later. Marla has never been late for a session before. She always opens the door dead on the minute of their session. So, it‚Äôs a surprise when there‚Äôs no welcome. Jess taps at the door and gingerly opens it a crack.

‚ÄúHello Marla? It‚Äôs Jess,‚Äù she calls, suddenly getting a pre-sentiment that all is not as it should be.

‚ÄúMarla?‚Äù

Jess sees Marla slumped over in her chair and she utters, ‚ÄúOh God, Marla!‚Äù and then routine swings into action. The ambulance is called. Jess tries CPR but it‚Äôs academic at this point, Marla is far, far away at this point. The paramedics don‚Äôt even bother when they arrive, just note the time of death. Her body is lifted onto a gurney and wheeled with care and some difficulty down the stairs. She is loaded into the ambulance and transported to hospital, where she is housed in the morgue, with five other people ‚Äì mostly older people, all dead. The police attend Marla‚Äôs office and liaise with the shocked landlord to make sure her room is locked up.

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt she only in her fifties?‚Äù

‚ÄúForty-eight,‚Äù the policeman replies.

‚ÄúGod, that‚Äôs no age is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The landlord to his credit takes at least an hour before he starts to think about clearing out her room and advertising the office. It‚Äôs bound to be in demand because it has a river view. Just need to make sure that it‚Äôs not known that she died¬†*in*¬†the actual office. That‚Äôs fine, there‚Äôs nothing that can‚Äôt be glossed over, or given a little spin to make it more palatable. It‚Äôs sad, she was a good therapist by all accounts. There‚Äôs no justice in this life is there?

To make himself feel better he takes the sack of mail that she had to the post box himself. He wonders why she has all these letters, but only in passing. Not enough to wonder if she wanted them posting. He reaches into the sack, over and over and brings out handfuls of letters and crams them through the slot. Then it‚Äôs done. He lights a cigarette and takes himself for a pint. It‚Äôs important to seize the day isn‚Äôt it? He says to the bar woman. Carpe diem, because you never know what‚Äôs in store for you and when your entire life might get flipped on its head.

1h4void,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4void,Closing thoughts,"Adorable how MarineAngemon is just this small dot.

Also I finished the game a few days ago, and because it took me a while to download the screenshots onto my device I hold of on my thoughts.

Final Boss is basicly a security wall. Had a super easy time beating it whit max INT Lilithmon, Grankuwagamon whit some Attack investment and Accel Boost, and MarineAngemon who had the extra ability to prevent oneshots. Arkadimon was so much harder, but that said, it was still a cool finale. 

I remember People said Hutimon wasnt much help? I dont know, I personaly think she helped a lot, she provided the type of boosts, and healing most appropiate for that respective Situation. 
And she wasnt in any way more useless as Cyberdramon, or some of the other bad supporters. 
Talking of supporters, I kinda wished Yuu was joining us. MarineAngemon could have been a great help. Also, let us romance him you cowards! 

I had already know about the twists, and as such I enjoyed how Wormmon was gratualy became more and more like Erika, and how this was all forshadowing for the Climax. Infact besides the larger Digimon roster, I wanted to play HM over CS because I liked the story more. 

What I disslike is, how we are now basicly in a kind of limbus. From what I understand, we can now repeat the final boss, and we are stuck in that hospital. I hate how slow the Elevator loads there. And absolutely hate how everything is now kinda halfe finished? Luckily I can use all the Teammates for Matches again, and enter Eden, and everything. I cant finish the Coffee Trophy, and the poor Waitress lost her job over us.
Its kinda sad to loose out main location like this. 

Well next Project was the Masters Cup. For that I have choosen Rosemon BM, Plesiomon, and Sakuyamon for Data, GranKuwagamon, Lilithmon, and Belphemon Sleep for Virus, and MarineAngemon, Alphamon Ouryuuken, and Sleipmon for Vaccine, whit Apocalymon (My Starter), and Lucemon Satanmode as emergency button. 
Was actually a fun, and well balanced experience. You just need a good gameplan, and you probably win. Fei is pretty taff, as an example, and has all three Typs. But my Lilithmon could one hit her Sakuyamon and from there I was able to wiggle her down whit the right Type. 
Grandracumon fight two, and VenomVamdemon not so much. The first just wasts your time, and is pretty frustrating as a healing HP tank, and the latter is not to tanky, but has the same problem, you need to play hyper aggro to get him down, and use two or more Vaccine piercers for it.

Game has definitly some ballancing Issues. You know how many Free Attribute Piercers there are? Zero.
And besides PvP, if a Digimon isnt a piercer, it just doesnt deal any damage. And many bosses need you to outdamage them, because of healing moves. So Data has litteraly just 3 endgame viable offensive Digimon, and free is completly useless in both ways, because resisting damage is as valuable as piercing. 
For the next game I hope they change the way enemys healt work, to make regular attackers more balanced, and give Free Digimon an Item, what cant stack its effect on top of itselfe and reduces Damage by 25%.
That way Free would be worse than the appropiate Element, but still able to tank damage. And because this Item works only once, you cant make them unreasonably tanky. 

About tanky, I think this game is generally best enjoyed at normal. While I enjoyed having more of a challenge, most of it comes from the healthpooll and thats not a very well designed way to increase the difficulty. 


The next game hopefully has some new locations, and more battle tracks for different locations. While the soundtrack and map design was absolutely fine, I feel the atmosphere of some side quests got a bit lost because of the rater generic arenas. 

I am going to 100% the rest of the game, so second playtrought is already in planing. For the imperialdramon medal from Victory Uchida, and the coffee I missed. Probably whit Hutimon, and Arkadimon as my mains.

Is everything fine whit Online Mode? I will get the coins for accessorys and for the online trophys first. And theres still two optional Quests I want to tackle. The last Hacker on my hitlist, and the anti Imperialdramon League part 2. 
And so yeah, I think thats mostly all I did, and have to say. I wonder, anything else? 

I wish Erika had the Eater Bits longer, I find it funny how Ryujis villian Ark is basicly used for Erikas Charakter developement, when its so often the other way around. Arkadimon played a much smaller and shorter roll in the story, I was a bit surprised. Yuus Ark was weirdly dissconnected from the actually mainplot, it just started everything and then got more and more inconsequentuall.

**Moms**, when you think of¬†**Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the¬†***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.¬† But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes,¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was secretly a¬†***business mastermind***?¬† That's right, and if you‚Äôre a¬†**mom**¬†looking to dominate the¬†**entrepreneurial world**, there‚Äôs one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that¬†**MJ magic**¬†into¬†**your empire**,¬†***‚ÄùMomPreneurs‚Äù***¬†a very serious well thought out¬†**business guide for moms**.¬†¬†

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**MJ**¬†wasn‚Äôt just the¬†***King of Pop***¬†‚Äì he was the¬†***Smooth Criminal***¬†of branding.¬† Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?¬† He wore ONE glove.¬† Genius.¬† Just like that,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it‚Äôll leave your competition asking,¬†***‚ÄúAnnie, are you okay?‚Äù***¬†¬†

**Moms,**¬†you don‚Äôt need to be the best at¬†***everything***; you just need to be memorable¬†***in your business niche.***¬† And hey, who better to teach you that than¬†**Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?¬†¬†

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you‚Äôre a man) of Your Business**

Much like¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was crowned the¬†***King of Pop***,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to become¬†**the Queen of your business.**¬† Don‚Äôt let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.¬† In fact, if¬†***Michael Jackson***¬†could write¬†***Billie Jean***¬†while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can¬†**build a six-figure business**¬†while managing playdates.¬†¬†

So, do you want to learn¬†***MJ‚Äôs real secrets***¬†**to success**¬†and apply them to your¬†***MomPreneur***¬†journey?¬† Then grab a copy of¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†today.¬† It might not teach you how to¬†***Moonwalk***, but it¬†***will***¬†teach you how to hustle like the¬†***King of Pop***.¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

***\*Disclaimer:***¬†*While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.¬† However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.¬† But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

In the dream, I was sitting in a cafe with my mom. I got up to order coffee at the counter, but the person working there gave me a strange, suspicious look, almost as if she was questioning me. I felt confused but prepared to defend myself. Then I overheard something about blood being found on the floor of a building. In my mind I thought, *This is ridiculous, what does that have to do with me?* She called the police and reported me. I calmly tried to explain that I had nothing to do with it, but she remained silent, staring at me with the same expression. Meanwhile, other people in the cafe were watching us, with surprised faces.

I went back to my seat and started telling my mom about it. But soon the police arrived, and a female officer began questioning me. I calmly answered the questions, feeling that it‚Äôs absurd to even have to do so. But again she too was silent. Then she pulled out some papers and handed them to me with a smile. They were my grades from school (I‚Äôm an adult and out of school). In my head I thought, *oh finally my grades I forgot about them.* That‚Äôs when I realized they were all pranking me.

I think this is a funny dream cuz why the hell would the police be pranking me. I even questioned it during the dream, wondering if they do this to all students and how could they possibly have the time for that.",1,1733148137.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False
1h4vlle,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h4vlle/aita_for_kicking_my_sil_out_on_thanksgiving/,AITA for kicking my SIL out on thanksgiving?,"Throwaway account

This is a long one I apologize but the situation is just odd.

I (30m) just bought my first house and decided to host thanksgiving for my big extended family (about 20 people). Among those I invited were my brother and his wife (both 35) and my three nieces (5,3,2) all who were driving from out of state.

Because my house isn't big enough for everyone to spend the night and eat I also rented out an air BNB down the road for anyone traveling a long distance to stay overnight at. It ended up being my parents, brother, and aunt and uncle staying there while my husband's siblings and parents stayed with us. 

On thanksgiving morning while we were all running around like crazy getting the food together, my brother at some point slipped out and drove all the way back home, leaving his wife and three kids with our family. After calling and texting from several family members, he told us he would be back the next day to pick up his wife and kids and to have them enjoy thanksgiving with us as he took their only car. His wife seemed very nonchalant about the whole ordeal. 

I offered to pay for an Uber or Lyft home for her to figure out what happened and watch the girls which she declined. We continued the day with the awkward air around it but slowly started noticing that she was passing her children off on other people throughout the day without asking. 

At first it wasn't a big deal, as we were worried about her in this whole fiasco, but eventually it became annoying. She would appear in the kitchen with the baby, pop her into someone's arms (who was in the middle of cooking) then disappear for an hour or so into the living room to watch some TV. I don't mind helping when asked but she never would ask and it was ALWAYS someone busy with cooking.

When we finally sat to eat she ended up sitting her girls at one end of the table and sitting on the opposite end, leaving her kids (one of which couldn't really feed herself, another needing lots of help) to fend for themselves. Of course my parents jumped on board helping, but my SIL never once asked anyone to help and just enjoyed her dinner. 

At the end of the night I offered to drive SIL back to the air BNB but she refused, saying her and the kids were staying in the house that night. I was very confused since all of their stuff was back at the air BNB. I told her my husband's family was staying here and that our family was at the air BNB which she confirmed then said ""yea, but we're really tired and want to stay here"". I told her there wouldn't be space for 4 more people and she still didn't move. 

My parents ended up bringing the girls back, but my SIL stayed her ground on my couch until it was about 1230am. I was angry and exhausted. I told her she needed to go or I was going to call 911 because clearly she was having an episode of some kind. She still didn't budge and I tried calling my brother about 5-6 more times before finally giving up and calling my parents. I was worried if I left her alone she would do something.

My mom came over at about 2am and tagged me out where she ended up staying up with my SIL for the rest of the night. The next morning they were both still up and chatting over coffee. I asked her when my brother was coming to pick her up and she just shrugged and something in me just snapped.

I yelled at her that she needed to go, and I didn't care how but since nobody was telling me anything that was going on I wasn't going to put up with the BS any longer. She just said that she ""needed a ride"". My mom called my dad who brought the girls over and he had to physically pick up my SIL to get her out of the house.

My dad ended up making the 4 hour drive to drop my SIL off at home as we kept the girls to make sure they were safe. My dad told me when he dropped off my SIL my brother was at home watching the football game and didn't seem surprised that she was home without the girls.  My dad grabbed some extra clothes and toys before he left and told me brother to call me later.

Currently me and my parents are swapping with watching the kids and my brother is calling me telling me how terrible I was to kick his wife out like I did. He's going to come next weekend to get the girls. He still never explained why he left or why his wife refused to leave my house.

It's only been a few days but I feel terrible about kicking her out in a possible crisis moment but I felt like I was going crazy and didn't want to be responsible for her as she was already behaving a little erratic all day. 

AITA?

TLDR;
My brother left his wife and kids at my house over thanksgiving. I kicked my SIL out after she was practically catatonic all day and refused to watch her kids. ",2,1733148068.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I just tried rooibos tea for the first time last week and i am hooked, I love the aroma and taste I have been having 4-5 cups a day since I first tried it.

Just a few questions about quality and personal preference. The ones I have now are ""our finest"" vanilla rooibos. I am really enjoying it but as I have never delved into these waters I can't tell if this is what you would consider ""good quality"". It was cheap, and if you steep it to the directions it does taste a bit weak so I tend to let it sit 2 minutes longer. 

What brands do you all enjoy? And what combination of flavors do you find compliment eatchother the best? Would looking for looseleaf rooibos tea be a better long term investment if I drink a lot? Do you add anything to your tea? I did try adding some 18% coffee cream to 1 cup I made and it was not very enjoyable to meüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è. 

Is there any negative health risks to drinking so much herbal tea in a day? I've tried using Gemini and it says it's beneficial and has no negative health impacts other then maybe stomach upset if you overconsume. I guess I'm just looking for some human reassurance..

1h4vhvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h4vhvj/my_24f_boyfriend_24m_installed_telegram_without/,"My (24F) boyfriend (24M) installed Telegram without telling me, especially given his past emotional cheating? Is it worth bringing up, or am I reading too much into it?","Bit of a long post but the context is necessary:

Earlier this year, I got to know that my boyfriend of 2.5 years was cheating on me for a very long time (nothing physical). He had made an alternative persona online (a fake profile with fake pictures and personality), messaged numerous other people (some of them were from where we are studying right now) and had sexual conversations with tens of people who had no idea that this was someone who didn't actually exist. He seemed genuinely regretful that he did that, and the fact that none of it was physical in nature or involved his real identify made me feel like it was more of a mental situation than something inherently wrong with our relationship.

He worked on a lot of issues in therapy and we got to what I thought was a good place. I have been very happy with him and liked that we have been able to somewhat move on as much as we can with the time we have from the earlier incident.

I snooped on his laptop and already feel pretty guilty and shitty about it. The best explanation is that I just didn't want to be hurt like before... We have an understanding that I can go through his text messages etc.

Anyway, I recently found that he has suddenly installed telegram on his laptop, which I have never seen him use or install before. He has archived a chat from a girl from middle school who he texted first, asking exactly who she was. They then had a conversation about how she was living in his old town, he gave her recommendations, nothing suspicious or wrong. We get to a point where she says that she is going to come to a city that we live in for a concert and if he would like to have a coffee with her. To which he said yes. This happened a month ago, and the dates for the concert have passed. He has never mentioned any plans to meet anyone from his older school, or the fact that he has tried to meet up with this girl or if it ever even ended up happening. She does not follow him on instagram either, which means that she cannot see that he is with me.

I also looked at activity logs to see if this was perhaps the only time he was online which would make it a lot more innocent and just a case of people reconnecting after a couple of years. However, I can see that he has no chats (or at least chats that I can read) with anyone else... and he has been online several times (as close as 3-5 days ago) since sending the last messages to this girl that I can see (which were a month ago). I know that Telegram has a secret chat feature, in which case I would never be able to see who he is chatting with or what he is actually doing on Telegram. He is not a part of any kind of groups. He has also installed Tor Browser for some reason. I am technologically challenged, I have myself never used Telegram or Tor.

I feel like I am going absolutely crazy. Before this relationship I would never even think of snooping on someone's private chats. Am I overthinking this? Or do I talk to him about it and try to understand exactly what is going on?

**TL;DR:**¬†Earlier this year, I found out my boyfriend of 2.5 years had been cheating emotionally by creating a fake online persona and engaging in sexual chats with numerous people. He seemed genuinely regretful, sought therapy, and we worked to rebuild our relationship.

1h4vgmi,https://mudhouse.com/products/super-specialty-coffee-subscription,I've never seen them mentioned here but thought this was a really neat (although way too expensive for me) subscription concept. ,"Mudhouse has been my favorite coffeehouse for probably 8 years. I moved away from charlottesville in 2020 unfortunately, but I've had a subscription from them on and off for years (in between finding local roasters in places I've moved). I just got an instagram ad for their ""are you gold"" subscription and, while way out of my price range, I thought it was a really neat idea. I always got the vibe when I went into the downtown Cville shop that they genuinely cared about people, especially the people who grow the coffee they sell. Not only that but mudhouse also got me through a horrible pregnancy. Sometimes I read posts on here that remind me of how nicely people can come together and talk, enjoy, (sometimes troll in good spirits) and it always brings me back to mudhouse. 

Friendly plug for Stay Goldman, Coffee out of Suffolk as well.  I've been following him on Instagram for a while and I just ordered my first few bags of beans to try and some shithead stole it off my porch while I was out of town (or it was marked delivered but not actually delivered by USPS but either way he's doing his best to try and help me figure it out.

Recently, I had a conversation with some friends about things their bosses did or said that made them go, ""WTF?"" The stories were so wild that I got curious to hear more. Have you ever experienced something like this?

As an Independent IT Contractor, I‚Äôve worked for a few companies and witnessed my fair share of crazy moments. Here are two incidents that have stayed with me:

1. Early in my career, while interning at a small IT company in Bedfordview, I had a colleague who became pregnant. Because it was a high-risk pregnancy, she went on medical leave. A few days after she left, I was in the coffee room and overheard my boss chatting with his two nephews (who also worked there). He said, *""Because of her, I‚Äôm not going to hire women anymore because they get pregnant, and I lose money because of them.""* The irony? This was coming from a man with two daughters!
2. At another company, my former boss, who already had five children (four boys and one girl from three different marriages), was thrilled to learn he was going to become a father again.

We recently purchased a De'Longhi Magnifica Evo for our office, and I‚Äôm still getting familiar with the settings. My boss prefers regular black coffee. The challenge is that the default pour size for regular coffee seems quite small‚Äîaround 8 oz, give or take.

Is there a way to adjust the pour volume to fill an entire coffee cup (approximately 12 oz)? Currently, if I brew twice, I have to stand by the machine to stop the second pour early, which isn‚Äôt ideal. My boss would really like to have a single button press for a larger coffee, if possible.

I‚Äôve managed to adjust pour volumes for espresso and milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, but I‚Äôm stuck when it comes to regular coffee. Should I simply add hot water, or is there a setting I‚Äôm missing that allows for a larger default pour?

Thanks in advance for any tips!

1h4vch3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1h4vch3/we_were_friends_for_five_years_but_in_her_head_i/,We were friends for five years but in her head I wanted her boyfriend ,"
First of all I apologize if I make any mistakes, English is not my first language 

We were friends for five years, now that years passed since the incident so I feel I can talk about it and just vent.

We met at the same company and worked together, Ivanna (not real name) and I hit it off almost immediately, she is two years older than me, we had the same musical taste, we liked the same books, we even shared some personality similarities (looking back now that should‚Äôve been a red flag for me) it was a real special friendship for me, we went through a lot of things together good and bad but always there for each other. Ivanna even introduced me to some things that I still like in the actuality (music and tv shows)

We were practically attached at the hip, spending a lot of days together, having sleepovers, holidays together, parties, family gatherings, you name it (not sexually lol) we were there together. She introduced me to her closest friends and I did the same with mine, -something that everyone used to say to us is that we were very look alike physically and personality wise but I always brushed off as ‚Äúwe spend a lot of time together so might be that""-
Something I still find funny was that every time she had a boyfriend or a love interest she wanted my opinion (she had more boyfriends than me during those five years); I always gave her the same answer: they were her type and taste, they weren‚Äôt my type so I didn‚Äôt find them attractive, as long as they were good to her i wouldn‚Äôt care anything else.
Ivanna had this boyfriend, James,that I honestly never liked but Ivanna was obsessed with me telling her if he was attractive or hot. I told her many times that no:
1- he was ugly for me
2- he was physically, verbally and emotionally abusive to her
3- he didn‚Äôt like me either because I was always telling her to dump him over reason number 2 
They were together for two years but never really made the relationship public so eventually he just left her for his ex.

I have to admit that after two years into the friendship, during some months, I went through a depressive episode and shut down a bit with everybody (I stopped telling Ivanna every detail of my life) but besides that I didn‚Äôt feel that everything changed, we were still hanging out a lot, going out to parties or to drink. But something in me started to change slowly, I was drifting away but I didn‚Äôt realize it 

Couple partners that didn‚Äôt mean a thing for her later, Ivanna met one guy that I used to be friends with. 

Long story short: I met John (two years before meeting Ivanna) from another friend in common and we hit it off, later he added me on Facebook and also followed me on twitter, we were talking on and off for that year or so and kinda flirted back then but, after some time just didn‚Äôt work and stopped talking.

Before telling me about their relationship, Ivanna used to tell me how she was feeling so sorry for John, he was constantly telling her how much he liked her, that he was practically begging for a relationship with her but that she didn‚Äôt even liked him that much, that she was meeting his family and all but she didn‚Äôt know how the things would go, telling me really deep things that he confident to her (really f up things) but again, Ivanna didn‚Äôt like him that much so she just didn't know how things would go, I used to tell her that John never really gave me any weird vibes and as far as I knew he was a good guy so maybe she should give him a chance. 

They started their relationship without me knowing (we were the kind of friend that told everything to each other but she kept that a secret) in January.  A month prior to that he dm me telling me a looked good in one picture and I told him we ""should go out for drinks one night"" he kinda laughed at it and said yes, sure. But that was the whole interaction.

NOTE: for some context,  I am not from the US so its probably not the same for Americans youths way to handle social media
When that relationship happened I was single and (being in my mid 20‚Äôs) I had him on a private friends profile for some time before they even met. At the time I was very open there about being single and wanting to date someone but nothing ever happened, John never asked me to get out of my friends or me to block him or anything during the time they dated.
I will be very honest, I used to post some spicy pics on that private profile but nothing too crazy (maybe some cleavage, maybe some peach but never too much AND NOT EVERY DAY). John was on that profile because I also used to vent to my friends there or posted really dumb memes, just things that I didn‚Äôt wanted the rest of my friends on my main profile to see.  However, some of my love interests were on there BUT that DINDT mean my whole private friends profile was destined only for that I also had NORMAL FRIENDS THERE -I hope I‚Äôm being clear about it 


She casually told me about John two months into their relationship while we were going to the mall after work but kinda avoided to give me much details. She just said that she thought I should know about her being John's girlfriend and etc, but never gave me details as she used to, I assumed she wanted to be private about it and I respect it. 

After that, Ivanna was telling me all the time that she was hanging out with him, usually at his house, that sex was amazing and he was an amazing boyfriend. If we were out somewhere he would pick her up no matter the hour, drive her home or to his place, if she was at my place he would drop her off or pick her up to take her somewhere -basic behaviors tbh but she wasn‚Äôt secretive about it anymore and honestly after all her previous f'up relationships it made me happy for her-

Ivanna was also very insistent on me telling her if I liked this boyfriend and for the first time I told her: ‚Äúyes, he‚Äôs cute, he‚Äôs a good guy and treats you really well I‚Äôm really happy for you‚Äù  later I learned that was my mistake 

Two more months passed and things were normal until one day she got really weird and started to ask me a lot of questions about John -we shared 1 to 1 conversations on my profile but nothing weird or inappropriate neither we ever hangout alone, it was always with her present-. Asking why weren't friend on Facebook anymore (I didn‚Äôt even noticed) Ivanna was asking what happened, so naturally I had no idea. 
She kept the attitude for days until I had enough of it, I asked her to meet for coffee and a talk about what was really going on. We settle an hour later on the day and agreed we would be there. She showed up to the coffee shop almost an hour late and I was very pissed (I had to go to work after that and I fixed my schedule specifically to talk to her but she, as always, was late and careless ) truth is I almost left but as I was about to ask for my check Ivanna sat next to me like nothing happen and gave me a hug. 

The conversation basically was her being very sentimental about me drifting away from her (mind you I was learning things from her from other friends because she wouldn‚Äôt tell me) our friendship not being the same and wondering what happened, I reminded Ivanna about how my depressive episode wasn‚Äôt a secret to her, I changed but I thought I didn‚Äôt changed much with her -apparently I did and she was concerned about that- after that, Ivanna asked me if I liked her boyfriend or wanted to be with him (it completely caught me off guard with that so I laughed) she repeated she was serious and wanted to know if I liked her boyfriend because she would move out the way and let me ‚Äúbe with him‚Äù and was very insistent on it. Ivanna wanted me to tell her if anything happened many times, she said she wouldn't be upset just wanted to know. 
This, of course, was ridiculous, but she kept insisting on the topic and later admitted that she was the one behind this unfriendinf situations, because she was worried I wouldn‚Äôt respect our friendship and keep having John where I posted pictures to trap guys -her words not mine-
I, of course, denied any kind of feeling towards John. Tried my best to reassure Ivanna that I would never do anything like that to her, that he wasn‚Äôt my type and that I wouldnt ruin the only thing I saw was making her really happy and bringing her stability . 
The whole situation was ridiculous to me but at the same time I tried to stand on her shoes and keep the peace reassuring some more that nothing ever happened, I had nothing to tell about John and I had no feelings for him whatsoever.

We left that coffee shop in good terms, me going to work, she going to his place and I genuinely thought we were good about our friendship.
Some weeks later I was constantly asking her to hangout, work together from her house or mine (we worked at the same company), or just going out for drinks but she slowly started to ghost me. The last straw was when she was really ignoring my texts but posting pictures on Facebook with other friends every day. 
One day one of her friends texted me to go to this party where ‚Äúeveryone was but me, that Ivanna really wanted me to go, everybody missed me‚Äù, but I was so pissed about the fact that she wouldn‚Äôt even reply to the text I sent her earlier asking her to hangout but was at a party telling her friends to text me to go ??? 
I declined saying that I was very tired from work and moved on with my night doing nothing, by myself.
Days passed and Ivanna texted me back about something random I told her, but the reality was that I was emotionally drained over everything and didn‚Äôt wanted to fix whatever was to fix. I didn‚Äôt reply and Ivanna never texted again.
Truth is that losing her friendship really affected me, I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere, stopped seeing my other friends, lost weight and almost got entirely back to my depression hole while she was out every day and posting pictures with captions like ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù something that was really hurtful for me. 
Eventually, I got back on my feet and started to go out again with other friends that weren‚Äôt in common with her, (some of my friends were friends with Ivanna first, so of course they stopped talking to me) my friends circle got smaller but I didn‚Äôt mind.
All the following year she kept posting pictures or facebook status throwing shade to this friend that wasn‚Äôt a real friend after all, that it was crazy, thank god they weren‚Äôt talking anymore and etc

I found out later that year from a friend that worked with us (of the very few we had still in common) that she was telling a different version of what happened, that apparently I was after her boyfriend and was a crazy whore. She broke up with John some weeks after ‚Äúour break up‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt doing really good apparently. I was a terrible friend, a crazy person and a wh#re to our work friends. Only to that friend I shared the true story and showed her convos and everything. 

Some time later I moved out of the city we shared and many years have passed. I got married, have kids and I‚Äôm living a very private life, with friends that I can count on one hand
I only decided to share this story because I saw a similar one here and inspired me to write.

Truth is, I don‚Äôt wish Ivanna anything bad, on her eyes and perspective there was something she didn‚Äôt share with me, we weren‚Äôt compatible to be best friends anymore and probably I was a bad friend sometimes and let her down on ways she didn‚Äôt share with me. Maybe it was my fault that anything happened and I didn‚Äôt realized. Maybe I was the real bad guy but I will never know because honestly, I don‚Äôt really care for her anymore.

I won‚Äôt post an update because: over 7 years have passed, we don‚Äôt talk anymore and don‚Äôt share any friends in common. I really have a lot more of her toxic tendencies as a friend but they don‚Äôt have any relevance to this story (sort of) 

If you ever read this Ivanna, you were a really good friend at the moment and were there for me when nobody else was. I wish you the best and a lot of happiness and stability because I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a bad person, sorry things turned out this way but I guess life had this way of work out. Thank you for all the great moments we had, have a good life.


I apologize for any mistakes made in this post (I speak other two languages so give me a break lol and don‚Äôt live in the US or any English speaking country to know all the grammatical rules) I did my best

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outdoor fire pit propane units have transformed backyard gatherings into cozy and inviting retreats. With a propane fire pit, you can enhance your outdoor space while creating a welcoming atmosphere for family and friends. Here‚Äôs how these versatile features can elevate your gatherings.

### Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the standout benefits of outdoor fire pit propane is its convenience. Unlike traditional wood-burning fire pits, propane models ignite quickly with just the press of a button. No need to build a fire or gather logs, which saves you time and effort.

- **Instant Flames:** A push-button ignition means you can start enjoying your fire pit within seconds.
- **No Mess:** Propane fire pits don‚Äôt leave behind ashes or debris, making cleanup a breeze.
- **Adjustable Heat:** With a propane option, you can kick up the heat when it‚Äôs chilly or tone it down on warmer nights, ensuring comfort for everyone.

### Enhanced Safety Features

Safety is a priority when it comes to outdoor gatherings, and propane fire pits excel in this area. The controlled flame and lack of flying sparks provide peace of mind for you and your guests. Here are some safety advantages:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Stable Flame:** The flame remains contained, reducing the risk of accidental fires.
- **Easy to Turn Off:** A simple valve allows you to extinguish the fire quickly if needed.
- **Less Smoke:** Unlike wood fires, propane produces minimal smoke, making it easier on sensitive lungs.

### Year-Round Enjoyment

Another significant advantage is that propane fire pits allow you to host events throughout the year. Whether it‚Äôs a chilly fall evening or a temperate summer night, having a propane fire pit extends your entertaining season. Here‚Äôs how:

- **Warmth When You Need It:** Propane fire pits provide the necessary heat to keep you comfortable under the stars, making outdoor gatherings enjoyable even on cold nights.
- **Versatility:** You can use propane fire pits for more than just warmth. They can serve as a focal point for gatherings, allowing you to roast marshmallows or share stories around the flame.

### Stylish Aesthetic

When choosing an outdoor fire pit propane, you'll be pleased with the variety of styles available. From sleek modern designs to rustic looks, there‚Äôs something to match your backyard d√©cor perfectly.

- **Customization:** Many models come in different materials and finishes, allowing you to personalize your space.
- **Outdoor Ambiance:** The soft glow of a propane fire pit can set a romantic or festive tone for your gatherings, enriching the atmosphere.

### Environmentally Friendly Choice

You might be surprised to learn that propane is a cleaner alternative to traditional firewood. It produces fewer greenhouse gases and generally burns much more cleanly. This makes propane fire pits a responsible choice for environmentally conscious homeowners.

- **Lower Emissions:** Propane generates fewer harmful pollutants than burning wood.
- **Renewable Sources:** As technology improves, some propane sources are being derived from renewable resources, further reducing your carbon footprint.

### Cost-Effective in the Long Run

While the initial investment in an outdoor fire pit propane may be higher than a wood-burning option, the long-term savings can offset this cost. Propane fuel generally burns longer and more efficiently than wood, meaning you‚Äôll buy less fuel over time.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Durability:** Many propane fire pits are built to withstand the elements, which can save replacement costs.
- **Reduced Fuel Costs:** Propane is often priced competitively compared to hardwood, making your overall investment more sensible.

As you create lasting memories with family and friends, this feature is sure to become the centerpiece of your outdoor experience. Enjoy the warmth, ambiance, and ease that a propane fire pit brings, ensuring your gatherings are memorable for all the right reasons.

Key Considerations When Choosing an Outdoor Fire Pit Propane for Your Home
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right outdoor fire pit propane for your home can enhance your outdoor space, offering warmth, ambiance, and a focal point for gatherings. With several options available, it‚Äôs essential to consider various factors before making a final decision. Here are key aspects you should keep in mind.

### Understanding Your Space

Before purchasing a propane fire pit, assess the area where you plan to place it. Think about:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Available Space:** Measure the area to ensure the fire pit fits comfortably without overcrowding.
- **Surroundings:** Consider nearby structures, plants, or furniture that could affect the safety and accessibility of the fire pit.
- **Desired Placement:** Decide if you want it on a patio, deck, or in a garden. Each location may require different fire pit designs.

### Types of Propane Fire Pits

Propane fire pits come in various styles and materials. Familiarizing yourself with the different types can help you choose the best option. Here are some common types:

- **Table Fire Pits:** These combine functionality and warmth, serving as a coffee table while providing a heat source.
- **Standalone Fire Pits:** Ideal for large gatherings, these can often accommodate more people and generate ample heat.
- **Portable Fire Pits:** Great for camping or small yards, these are easy to move and store when not in use.

### Safety Features

Safety should always be a priority when selecting a propane fire pit. Look for features that ensure a safe experience:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Flame Control:** Choose a model with an adjustable flame so you can customize the heat output.
- **Safety Shut-Off Valve:** This feature turns off the gas supply if the flame goes out, preventing potential hazards.
- **Fire Glass or Rocks:** These materials not only enhance aesthetics but also help contain the flames safely.

### Heat Output

Another important consideration is the heat output of the propane fire pit, measured in BTUs (British Thermal Units). A higher BTU rating means more heat. Think about:

- **Outdoor Temperature:** Colder climates may require a model with a higher BTU output.
- **Intended Use:** If you plan on entertaining large groups, opt for a fire pit with higher heat capacity.
- **Comfort Level:** Make sure the fire pit provides enough warmth for your comfort without being overpowering.

### Design and Material

The design of your fire pit should complement your outdoor aesthetic. Consider the following:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Material:** Fire pits typically come in stainless steel, aluminum, or stone. Stainless steel offers durability, while stone adds a rustic look.
- **Color:** Choose a color that matches or enhances your outdoor decor for a cohesive look.
- **Shape:** Round, square, and rectangular designs can influence seating arrangements and the overall feel of your outdoor space.

### Maintenance and Durability

Choosing a durable propane fire pit can save you time and money in the long run. Consider maintenance requirements:

- **Weather Resistance:** Check if the material can withstand outdoor conditions, including rain and snow.
- **Ease of Cleaning:** Some models require more upkeep than others. Look for fire pits that can be easily cleaned and maintained.
- **Warranty:** A good warranty can provide peace of mind, indicating the manufacturer‚Äôs confidence in the product.

### Cost Consideration

Consider your budget. Outdoor fire pits can range from affordable to high-end designer models. Analyze your affordability while keeping in mind:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/outdoor-fire-pit-propane  
  
- **Installation Costs:** Some fire pits may need professional installation, which can add to the overall cost.
- **Operational Costs:** Factor in propane costs, as different models may consume propane at different rates.
- **Long-Term Investment:** A higher initial investment in quality products can lead to better durability and performance over time.

By considering these essential factors, you can confidently choose the right outdoor fire pit propane for your home. With the right choice, you‚Äôll enjoy cozy nights and memorable gatherings year-round.

### Conclusion

An outdoor fire pit propane can transform your backyard into a cozy and inviting space, perfect for gatherings with family and friends. The warmth and ambiance provided by a propane fire pit create a magical atmosphere that encourages conversations and lasting memories. Imagine roasting marshmallows, sharing stories, and enjoying starry nights all around the flickering flames. The convenience of propane allows you to enjoy that warmth without the hassle of traditional wood-burning fire pits, making them a practical choice for many homeowners.

When selecting the right propane fire pit for your home, consider key factors such as size, design, and safety features. Choosing a unit that fits your outdoor space and complements your overall aesthetics is essential for creating a harmonious environment. Safety should always be a priority, so look for features like flame control and protective screens. Taking these considerations into account will ensure that your fire pit serves as a beautiful focal point and a safe haven for relaxation.

UK [¬£1000-¬£2000]","I am in the process of getting a new espresso machine after spending few years with my sage duo temp pro. I recently upgraded my grinder to the Mazzer Philos (I200D) and looking for something to pair it with. 

As in post title. I only drink espresso, 3-4 per day. I don't enjoy milk with coffee and my partner also has a super automatic for cappuccino and guests that might want milk based coffees.

I'm after more consistency in my espresso, as the DTP can vary a lot from shot to shot and want PID control for temperature adjustment. I enjoy light-med roasts. 

At first I was looking at the Lelit Bianca. It has pretty much everything I would ask from a machine. But I am not sure I need a dual boiler if I only drink espresso and I might end up wasting money for things I don't need.

I am now thinking to get the ECM Classika or Puristika. It's a great machine, E61 group head that I'd like to play with, PID control and can upgrade with a flow control kit.  Am I over simplifying when I think I just need a good single boiler machine?

Bianca comes at ¬£2100 vs ¬£1130 for the Classika, but Bianca includes bottomless prorafilter and flow control. If you add these to the Classika it looks more like 2100 vs 1400 (still ¬£700 difference).

* ECM Classika: Single boiler, PID, possible flow control
* ECM Puristika: very close price to Classika so don't see why I would get this other than looks
* Lelit Bianca: Dual boiler, PID, flow control installed, but more expensive
* Profitec GO: Cheaper than the rest, Single boiler, PID,not possible flow control

I am open for other recommendations, but mostly trying to make sure I don't miss something by going single boiler.

  
PS: My dream machine used to be the Rocket Appartamento (based on looks) but I realise it's not the best value out there. 

  
TL;DR: Do I need more than a single boiler (ECM Classika) if I only drink espresso or do I miss other features that come only with more expensive dual boilers?

I started treating the constipation with slippery elm bark, triphala and magnesium. This was followed by extreme diarrhea and excessive gas. I then pulled back on the herbs but now I'm experiencing the constipation again. Is it best to go into ceremony constipated and let Grandmother clean me out? Is it okay to take slippery elm or magnesium and drink aloe juice leading up? Or perhaps just some decaf coffee with ghee in the mornings to promote gut motility?

Looking for a sleek, quiet mouse that won't disturb your coworkers? I recently got my hands on the Logitech M240 Silent, and I'm impressed with its features.

This compact Bluetooth mouse connects quickly without a dongle, making it perfect for my cluttered desk. I love how it barely makes a sound when I click - it's 90% quieter than a regular mouse but still feels satisfying to use. The comfortable shape fits my hand nicely, and I can use it for hours without discomfort.

https://preview.redd.it/hlen1demrf4e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=849d6ab31b51a61270f19bf8cbbb056218b6e33f

The battery life is a standout feature. I've been using it for weeks, and it's still going strong. Logitech claims it can last up to 18 months, which is great for those who hate changing batteries often.

I like that it works with many devices - I've used it with my Windows laptop and Android tablet without issues. The range is good too - I can control my computer from across the room if needed.

While it's not the fanciest mouse out there, it gets the job done well. It tracks smoothly on most surfaces, and the buttons are responsive. The off-white color looks clean and professional on my desk.

One thing to note - it only has three buttons, so it might not be ideal for power users who need lots of programmable options. But for everyday use, it's more than enough.

# Bottom Line

The Logitech M240 Silent is a solid choice for a quiet, reliable mouse. Its long battery life and versatility make it a great pick for office or home use.



# Unveiling the Logitech M240 Silent Bluetooth Mouse

I recently got my hands on the M240 Silent mouse from Logitech. This compact Bluetooth device is a game-changer for quiet workspaces. Its near-silent clicks won't disturb others, yet still feel satisfying to use.

The mouse connects quickly to my devices without needing a USB dongle. I appreciate its comfortable shape, which fits nicely in my hand during long work sessions. Battery life is impressive - I haven't had to change it in months.

While small and portable, the M240 tracks smoothly on most surfaces. It works well with different operating systems, from Windows to ChromeOS. The mouse is also made partly from recycled plastic, which I find admirable.

One downside is its compact size, which might not suit users with larger hands. But for me, it's a solid choice for everyday use, striking a good balance between function and portability.

# Seamless Connectivity at Your Fingertips

I love how easy it is to use this mouse. It pairs quickly with Bluetooth, no dongle needed. I can connect to my laptop, tablet, or PC in seconds. The range is great too - I can control my device from up to 33 feet away. It works smoothly with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, and more. I switch between devices often, and this mouse keeps up without issues. The battery lasts a long time, so I don't have to worry about it dying mid-task. Overall, the M240 makes connecting and using my devices simple and hassle-free.

# Quiet as a Whisper

I was amazed by how silent this mouse really is. The M240's clicks are barely audible, making it perfect for quiet environments. I used it in a library and nobody noticed. The smooth tracking feels great too. It's a big upgrade from my old noisy mouse. The quiet clicks don't sacrifice feel - they still have a nice tactile response. I can work late at night without bothering my family now. If you need a mouse that won't disturb others, this is a great choice.

# Battery Life That Just Goes On and On

I've been using this mouse for months, and the battery life is impressive. The M240 lasts up to 18 months on a single AAA battery. This long-lasting power means I rarely need to swap batteries. The auto-sleep feature helps save energy when I'm not using it. I can work for weeks without worrying about the mouse dying. It's great for travel too - I don't have to pack extra batteries. The battery indicator lets me know when it's time for a change, but that doesn't happen often. Overall, the M240's battery life is a standout feature that makes it super convenient to use day-to-day.

# Designed for Comfort and Portability

I found this mouse to be a great travel companion. The compact size fits easily in my laptop bag without adding much weight. It's comfortable to use for long periods, thanks to its contoured shape that fits nicely in my hand. The slim design works well for both left and right-handed users.

One drawback is that it might be too small for those with larger hands. But for me, it's just right. The wireless Bluetooth connection is a big plus, freeing up USB ports on my devices. I can use it up to 33 feet away from my computer, which comes in handy during presentations.

The silent clicks are another standout feature. They're 90% quieter than standard mice, making it perfect for coffee shops or shared workspaces. No more bothering others with constant clicking noises!

# Environmentally Conscious Computing

I was pleased to find that this mouse is made with the environment in mind. The M240 Silent uses certified post-consumer recycled plastic in its construction. For the off-white version I tried, 37% of the plastic parts come from recycled sources. This shows Logitech's commitment to reducing waste. The mouse is also certified carbon neutral, which means its production doesn't add to greenhouse gas emissions. I like that I can use this device knowing it has a smaller environmental impact. The long 18-month battery life also means I don't have to replace batteries often, cutting down on battery waste. It's nice to see tech products taking steps to be more eco-friendly.

# Diverse Compatibility

I found the M240 to work seamlessly across different devices and systems. It paired easily with my Windows laptop, Mac desktop, and even my Chromebook tablet. The Bluetooth connection was quick and stable. I didn't need to install any extra software - it just worked out of the box. The mouse tracked smoothly on various surfaces in my home office. Its compact size made it perfect for tossing in my bag when I needed to work on-the-go. The optical sensor was responsive and accurate whether I used it on my desk, a cafe table, or even my couch arm. Battery life was great too - I've been using it daily for months without needing to change the AAA battery.

# Pros and Cons

After using this mouse for a while, I've gotten a good feel for its strengths and weaknesses. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Super quiet clicks
* Long battery life (up to 18 months)
* Compact and portable design
* Works with many devices and operating systems
* Bluetooth connectivity (no dongle needed)
* Made with recycled plastic

# Cons

* Small size may not suit larger hands
* No customizable buttons
* Not ideal for gaming

This Logitech mouse has a lot going for it. I love how quiet it is - perfect for working in shared spaces or late at night. The battery life is impressive too. I've been using it for months without needing to change batteries.

The compact size makes it easy to toss in my bag when I'm on the go. It works smoothly with my laptop, tablet, and even my phone. No need to carry a USB dongle either, which is great.

I appreciate that Logitech used recycled plastic in this mouse. It's nice to see companies making more eco-friendly products.

On the downside, the small size might not be comfortable for everyone. My hands are average-sized, and it feels a bit cramped after long use. There aren't any extra buttons to customize, which some people might miss.

While it tracks well for everyday use, I wouldn't recommend it for serious gaming. It's just not built for that kind of intense use.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this Logitech mouse for a while now, and it's clear why so many users love it. With over 34,000 ratings and an average of 4.5 stars, it's a hit. People rave about how comfortable it is, even for long work days. The wireless design and long battery life are big pluses. Many folks appreciate its compact size, making it perfect for travel. The silent clicks are a game-changer for those working from home or in quiet spaces. Some users with larger hands find it a bit small, so that's worth noting. Overall, customers seem thrilled with its performance, smooth tracking, and ease of use across different devices. It's a solid choice for anyone needing a reliable, portable mouse.

# Conclusion

After using the M240 Silent mouse for a while, I'm impressed with its performance and features. The quiet clicks make a big difference in noise reduction, which is great for shared spaces. Its compact size and long battery life make it perfect for on-the-go use. The Bluetooth connection works well across different devices and platforms. While it might be too small for some hands, I find it comfortable for everyday tasks. The eco-friendly materials are a nice bonus. For users seeking a reliable, quiet, and portable mouse, this Logitech model is a solid choice. It's not perfect, but it delivers on its promises and offers good value for the price.",1,1733145591.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

1h4urm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1h4urm6/looking_for_recommendations_for_a_beginner_who_is/,Looking for recommendations for a beginner who is about to give up (Hario V60 + Timemore C2s),"I have been trying to brew a cup that I enjoy for around three weeks now, with an average of two attempts per day. I have been trying different coffees, different methods, youtube, chatGPT, etc. Experimenting was fun in the beginning, but I kind of also want to drink a decent cup of coffee at this point...

My grinder is a Timemore C2s. My dripper is the Hario V60-02.

Almost all my attempts tend to be too sour (as in lemon juice). There's been a couple better drinkable results but with different issues, and really not enjoyable enough for me. Sourness/acidity is my biggest enemy. I'm throwing away most of the cups I brew.

I want something round and full bodied, and really don't care much about particular flavors or notes as long as it's intense but balanced . I always prefer (balanced) bitterness over sourness.

I don't get the impression I really extracted the potential from the local coffees I bought, which all came from very specific locations in South America, with roast dates, etc.

The problem is there are too many variables. Maybe my preferences are the problem, and I'm simply unaware of what it is I specifically prefer. But maybe the coffees I'm trying are just not that good for the Hario V60 method? Or maybe my pouring technique is so bad and inattentive I'm somehow affecting the whole result? 

There is too little time to find out through trial and error because there are so many variables which affect each other, too little money to buy enough coffees or better equipment, and I have too little patience to continue adjusting variables without remarkable results, and to wait for my cup of coffee which I technically need every morning. 

Might as well go back to the old autmatic dripper... I would be very sad to take that depressing path, especially after all the pleasure of the fantastic smell of freshly ground beans, the care that goes into pouring, etc.

So I'm thinking, **if I could get a specific reasonably priced good baseline coffee I can buy online**, with a specific recipe adapted to my specific equipment, I would finally be able to verify whether I'm the problem somehow.

The only thing I know for sure about my taste is I usually prefer woodsy dark bitter tastes over fruity acidic tastes.

Any recommendations and tips would be appreciated. Warmest thanks in advance.

He has cheated before. What do I do?,"Bit of a long post but the context is necessary: 

Earlier this year, I got to know that my boyfriend of 2.5 years was cheating on me for a very long time (nothing physical). He had made an alternative persona online (a fake profile with fake pictures and personality), messaged numerous other people (some of them were from where we are studying right now) and had sexual conversations with tens of people who had no idea that this was someone who didn't actually exist. He seemed genuinely regretful that he did that, and the fact that none of it was physical in nature or involved his real identify made me feel like it was more of a mental situation than something inherently wrong with our relationship. 

 He worked on a lot of issues in therapy and we got to what I thought was a good place. I have been very happy with him and liked that we have been able to somewhat move on as much as we can with the time we have from the earlier incident. 

I snooped on his laptop and already feel pretty guilty and shitty about it. The best explanation is that I just didn't want to be hurt like before... We have an understanding that I can go through his text messages etc. 

Anyway, I recently found that he has suddenly installed telegram on his laptop, which I have never seen him use or install before. He has archived a chat from a girl from middle school who he texted first, asking exactly who she was. They then had a conversation about how she was living in his old town, he gave her recommendations, nothing suspicious or wrong. We get to a point where she says that she is going to come to a city that we live in for a concert and if he would like to have a coffee with her. To which he said yes. This happened a month ago, and the dates for the concert have passed. He has never mentioned any plans to meet anyone from his older school, or the fact that he has tried to meet up with this girl or if it ever even ended up happening. She does not follow him on instagram either, which means that she cannot see that he is with me. 

I also looked at activity logs to see if this was perhaps the only time he was online which would make it a lot more innocent and just a case of people reconnecting after a couple of years. However, I can see that he has no chats (or at least chats that I can read) with anyone else... and he has been online several times (as close as 3-5 days ago) since sending the last messages to this girl that I can see (which were a month ago). I know that Telegram has a secret chat feature, in which case I would never be able to see who he is chatting with or what he is actually doing on Telegram. He is not a part of any kind of groups. He has also installed Tor Browser for some reason. I am technologically challenged, I have myself never used Telegram or Tor. 

I feel like I am going absolutely crazy. Before this relationship I would never even think of snooping on someone's private chats. Am I overthinking this? Or do I talk to him about it and try to understand exactly what is going on?

**TL;DR:**¬†Earlier this year, I found out my boyfriend of 2.5 years had been cheating emotionally by creating a fake online persona and engaging in sexual chats with numerous people. He seemed genuinely regretful, sought therapy, and we worked to rebuild our relationship.

We exchange some emails, she conveys my greetings when she visits family over the holidays.  Turns out they remember me too.  Warm fuzzies all around.

Now she is back in town and asked if I'd like to meet for dinner or coffee.  Now, she is not inviting me to her house, because she adds, ""I like all types of food"" and asks me what I would prefer, where we should go.  It seems that she is asking me to suggest a place to go for this dinner or coffee.

Eating out is just too expensive for me.  I don't see any non-awkward way to say that so I am wondering if I could suggest that we instead meet at the library.  We can just as easily catch up there and in some areas they allow snacks so if she wanted to bring coffee for herself she could do so. 

The other options I thought of are: 

1) I could invite her over to my place.  If I knew her better this might be the obvious choice.   But just because she suggested a meal I don't think I am obligated to make that happen either by paying for it outside or cooking / hosting it myself. 

2) Say ok for coffee and let her drink the coffee and not order anything - but that might not be fair to the shopkeeper?  I don't actually drink coffee anyway.  In a large group I would not feel awkward joining for conversation and not ordering anything, I am often in this position.  But if it is just two of us this would be conspicuous.

For my demographic, I am a 16M coming from an upper-class family, and I have no affiliation with any Jewish organization, nor do I have any Jewish genetics in my blood. However, being taught about the value of fairness, justice, and logical thinking has always baffled me about the ""Free Palestine"" trend and its arguments that, based on logic, history, and real quantitative as well as qualitative data, are horrendous lies based on double standards as well as unjust hatred for the Jewish communities from the majority of hateful Arab population as well as uneducated social media followers for Palestine who I believe have done no actual researches nor have any understanding about this subject.

I will be basing my post on five main debunking of the most common arguments for Palestine and Hamas as well as to demonstrate the ludicrous nature of Palestine support.

**1: Israel has stolen lands from Palestine as well as has been occupying their lands for hundreds of years.**

**2: The IDF is committing war crimes against the Gaza Strip and is on a genocidal spree.**

**3: Hamas is a resistant group fighting against the occupation of the Zionist**

**4: Israel have turned Gaza into an open-air concentration camp before Oct 7th**

**5: The war have been continuing long before Oct 7th**

**5: Conclusion**

**1: The actual ownership of the land is based on Jewish people rather than Arabs**

While researching the origin of both the Gaza Strip and Israel, it surprised me a lot to find out that the land is Jewish by origin, and no text has ever mentioned an independent region called 'Palestine"". Let's look over some historical timelines.

**Ancestry of the land:**

The Bible mentioned that the Jewish people were present on the land predating the Arab settlements by more than 4000 years when god bequeathed the land to the Jewish people. Jews occupied the land for more than 2600 years, according to Abraham's time, and by at least 1600 years, if we are measuring it by the formation of the kingdom of Israel *(1)(2) (ICEJ,* 2017)*.* The land in question was named Judea, led by three different kings at the time before being split into two distinctive kingdoms, and one of them was called ""Israel."" Jewish people were frequently exiled from their land during the reign of the Roman empire in which the name ""Palestine"" was named to the Jewish land of Judea when, during 135 AD, emperor Hadrian attempted to remove all traces of Jewish people by naming the land of Jewish Judea ""Palestine"" based on the eternal enemies of the Jewish, the ""Philistines"" who were of Greek origin rather than Arab. (3) (Chrysopoulos, 2024)). Also, according to Dutch historian Relandi, most of the settlements predating the land of Israel were Jewish, Hebrew, and Roman, and none of them was Arabic, which further demonstrates that historically, Jewish people have predated the land they are staying on well before the Arabs nor the Palestinians.

**How did the Arabs settle onto the land of the Jews?**

Great question! The land of Judea, which was renamed Palestine, was controlled by the Christian Byzantine Empire (not the Jews nor the Arabs) after the collapse of Rome. The land of Palestine was under the settlement of the Byzantine Empire, which had a minimal number of Jewish people living there because of the earlier exile by the Romans in which most of them had to find asylums in Europe or other countries in the Middle East; in fact, most of the Jewish in Roman and Byzantine Palestine lived on farms and slums ((Bryn, 1999)). After 300 years of control from the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman, and Islamic invaded the land; the result of this is that the Arabic and Islamic people ruled the land of the Jews proclaimed ""Palestine"" for more than 1400 years. We can see from all of these historical facts that initially, the land was 100% Jewish, and most of them were exiled, only to be occupied by both the Palestine and Ottoman empires.

**The purchase and acquiring of the Arabic land:**

Even if we stand on ownership ground that states that if the Ottoman Empire and Arabic settlements occupied the land after the Jews left, they have no claim on what would now be Israel, I believe that this argument is ridiculous based on Jewish legal buying of all the land from the Arab land owners. Much of those lands were deemed undesirable and worthless by Arab landowners due to the majority of them being placed in malaria-infested areas as well as deserts; in fact, over 73% of all the lands Jews have nowadays were bought from Arab landowners at ridiculous prices (ICEHJ, 2017) (4). The graph below shows the Jewish acquisition of Arab lands, and what fascinated me the most is that most of those lands were placed in malaria-infested swamps and high-temperature deserts that would be seen as unlivable at the time.

***Link to the image: The first link shows the area of Mandatory Palestine (This is not ""Palestine,"" so do not get confused) infested with malaria owned by Arab people, and the second link shows the acquisition pattern of Jewish people:***

***1:*** [***https://www.jewsfww.uk/general-allenby-and-the-elimination-of-malaria-in-palestine-israel-3876.php***](https://www.jewsfww.uk/general-allenby-and-the-elimination-of-malaria-in-palestine-israel-3876.php) ***(5)***

***2:https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Jewish-settlement-areas-black-UN-Map-1947-in-relation-to-areas-with-most-severe\_fig4\_354708450 (6)***

After all of these patterns of Jewish land ownership from Arabic landowners, I find it idiotic that some people would still try to push the notion of Israel illegally occupying those lands. When a nation or a group of people purchase a piece of land, it belongs to them permanently; Arab landowners could not imagine that those malaria-infested lands and worthless deserts overpaid by the Jewish could be rebuilt into modern cities and modern farmlands in what would now be called Israel.



**A further gain of the land of Israel during 1948:**

Many people seem confused about the name ""British Mandate of Palestine."" For some clarification, the name does not assert an actual region named ""Palestine"" in a Jewish land. In 1922, 51 nations in the League of Nations, which would become the United Nations, adopted the name 'British Mandate for Palestine,"" and this refers to the international recognition that Jewish people are indigenous to the land of Israel and will have all rights to settlement between everywhere from between the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. (7) (Secretary-General & League, 1947). Professor Schochetman of Hebrew University on international law said:

>""The right of the people of Israel to the Land of Israel was recognized by the League of Nations in 1921‚Ä¶From then on, \[the Balfour Document\] became accepted by all nations.""

United Nations was formed after the disbandment of the League of Nations, and the United Charter has stated that:

>""a special clause, no. 80, in which it is said that all of the rights that were recognized in international law by the League of Nations still exist and are still binding . . . no document in international law grants rights of sovereignty to anybody other than to the Jewish People. This is the legal position,""

In 1947, 25 years after the recognition of the indigenous nature of the Jewish people, they declared statehood and the United Nations accepted this. This allows Israel to be formed and all of its rights recognized by the international community. However, five arab countries, including Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, attacked Israel right after this recognition, not agreeing to the declaration of the state. Until 1948, hundreds of thousands of Arabs were displaced from their lands because of these main reasons:

\-Arab leader's encouragement and promises of victory, which will result in an expansion of land

\-Some crossed into other Arab nations but were rejected, so they had to stay at refugee camps, which they remain there to this day

\-Some left for safety and were unable to return after the fighting stopped

\-Some sadly were driven away from their land by Zionist militaries



The fighting during the year of 1948 led to a further increase in lands for Israel as after each defeat, the Arab coalition had to abandon their defensive regions; this allows Israel to be able to gain capture of the abandoned lands, however little they are.  Israel's Proclamation of Independence in 1948 invited Arab inhabitants who were driven away during the war to return to their homes in Israel, and 160 000 Arabs who remained in Israel now still enjoy full rights as Israeli residents with freedom and opportunities; this further shows the ethics of Israel to the Arab community after the war. On the other hand, the defeat of the Arabs led to more than 800 000 Jewish citizens being stripped of all of their properties in the Arab States (8).

**6 days war in 1967 and the formation of Gaza:**

In 1967, after continuous unwarranted attacks by the guerilla armies from Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, as well as mobilization of the Arab coalition when King Hussein signed a pact with Egypt to attack Israel, it led to a war. The war ended in just 6 days, with Israel capturing these main lands: the West Strip of Jordan, the Gaza Strip, and well as Jerusalem (9) (Britannica, 2019). Of course, the legality of the Israeli acquisition of those lands is on the grey area of international law; Prof. Eugene of Law of Northwestern University has said these after the war:

>‚ÄúSince the adoption of the U.N. Charter, international law prohibits any acquisition of foreign territory by force. There was certainly no such blanket prohibition on territorial change resulting from the war in 1967 when Egyptian and Jordanian territories came under Israeli control. At the time, international law only prohibited the acquisition of force in illegal or aggressive wars.

>The U.N. Charter does not make¬†*al*l wars illegal. Indeed, it expressly reaffirms the legality of a defensive battle. Since defensive war is not unlawful, the defender‚Äôs territorial gains from such a war would not be illegal.

Even if Israel had the legal right to hold onto these lands, they were quick to give them back to their old enemies.

>In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in which Israel agreed to withdraw from the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending on¬†**26 April 1982**.

>In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements. Israel also withdrew from the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip of land adjacent to the border with Egypt, after Egypt agreed to secure its side of the border after the Agreement on Movement and Access, known as the Rafah Agreement.

All of this evidence clearly shows double standards of the uneducated supporters of Palestine not entirely looking into historical facts of Jewish ancestry of the land, their legal acquisition of the undesirable regions in mandated Palestine, their international recognition of state rights as well as their entirely ethical treatment of Arab enemies after the fighting, giving them back a lot of their lands and even allowing some of their citizens to live in Israel.

**2: Israel have turned Gaza into an open-air concentration camp before Oct 7th**

Based on all logics of economical growth, income and standards of living, I have my reasons to believe that this is entirely an exaggerated lie. When you hear about the term ""Open-air concentration camp"", you would imagine a desolated plot of lands with the majority of its citizens living in extreme poverty and hardship, but this isn't even remotely true in Gaza. Were there poverty and hardship though? Absolutely! What people fail to tell you is the bustling and the good living condition of the majority of the Gazans. They do not tell you about the shopping malls, resorts, busy streets and even 36 hospitals, ask yourself this. Are those found in concentration camps?

Some of the photos and videos of the infrastructures and municipalities in gaza:

1: [https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/16100/gaza-luxury](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/16100/gaza-luxury)

2: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic\_University\_of\_Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_University_of_Gaza)

3: [https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g6697294-zff8-Gaza-Hotels.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g6697294-zff8-Gaza-Hotels.html)

Even Hamas is trying to hide these from you cause it goes against their notions of a poverty stricken gaza:

>Hamas is worried that the photos and videos taken by Palestinians would reveal to the world a different reality of the situation in the Gaza Strip -- a reality that runs contrary to all the stories and images of ""poverty,"" ""misery"" and ""suffering"" of Palestinians there.

>What Hamas seeks to conceal from the world are the shopping malls, supermarkets, fancy restaurants, sleek coffee shops and modern clothing stores that have¬†[sprung up](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/265683)¬†in the Gaza Strip in recent years. (10) (Gatestone Institute, 2020)

No one is telling you about health and quality of life of Gaza exceeding major parts of the worlds:

>Health and quality of life (in Gaza) vastly exceed the average in most parts of the world - and not just where people are in more obvious need, such as Africa, but even in developed countries like China and areas of South America. The poverty rate in Gaza is 16% - roughly equal to Spain, Germany and California. The rate of poverty is actually higher in Greece, most of the EU, and even parts of the United States, such as Washington D.C. As researcher Daniel Greenfield has pointed out, at 24%, even the poverty rate in Israel is actually 50% higher than in Gaza  


>As of 2017, life expectancy at birth in the Gaza Strip was 75.14 years, higher than Brazil, Peru, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Russia, or Ukraine. There are strains to living in Gaza, and so the territory has a high migration rate, but not quite as high as Lithuania or Latvia. Per capita income in both Gaza and the West Bank is $6,220 per year, far below Israel, but still above much of Central America, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and a number of Pacific islands. Gaza and the West Bank are dense in terms of urban population but far less than Singapore, Kuwait, and Belgium. Even if statisticians separated the West Bank and Gaza in their findings, there remains significant open space and farming in the strip. Unemployment is very high but not as high as in South Africa or Kenya. \~""Is Gaza Really like a Concentration Camp?"" Washington Examiner (11) (AEI, 2022) 

Not to mention that Gaza received well over 4.5 billion dollars in aid from the UN before the war, they had everything they needed to build schools, hospitals and municipalities to turn the Gaza strip that Israel left to turn into a paradise of land full of cultures and life; Israel would've gladly helped them to build that vision. Instead, the Hamas animals used those money to fund rockets, weapons and tunnels, all those things that would be used to destroy Israel once and for all which is the entire aim of Hamas and the Gaza:

>Ismail Haniyeh in 2020: He¬†[explained¬†](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-we-entitled-airport-seaport-projects-will-not-give-up-weapons-resistance-in-exchange)that Hamas rejects ceasefire agreements by which, ‚ÄúGaza would become Singapore,‚Äù preferring to remain at war with Israel until a Palestinian state is established¬†[from the River to the Sea](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/slogan-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free): ‚ÄúWe cannot, in exchange for money or projects, give up Palestine and our weapons. We will not give up the resistance...¬†**We will not recognize Israel, Palestine must stretch from the \[Jordan\] River to the \[Mediterranean\] Sea.‚Äù**¬†(12) (ADL, 2024) 

**3: Israel is committing war crimes and genocide in the Gaza**

The favorite argument of the blind Palestine supporters is arguing that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians and again, this shows the ignorance of many of the indoctrinated-media affected teenagers of our generation. First, let's define genocide:

>The definition contained in Article II of the Convention describes genocide as¬†**a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part**.



When we see the actions of Israel, none of what they are doing is made with the intent of genocides and full killing of the Palestinian population. I have to stress that this attack is made with the attempt of removing a terrorist group that has malicious and full intention of the slaughtering of Jewish people and they will never stop until they have finished it. You can see it by the quotes of the Hamas leaders:

>On August 20, 2012, in a sermon broadcast on Hamas‚Äôs Al-Aqsa TV, Hamas official Sheik Ahmad Bahr[¬†prayed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-leader-prays-for-annihilation-of-americans-jews/), ‚ÄúOh Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one.‚Äù  
  
On July 12, 2019, at a March of Return rally that aired on Hamas‚Äôs Al-Aqsa TV, Hamas Political Bureau member Fathi Hammad[¬†implored](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-political-bureau-fathi-hammad-explosive-belts-knives-slaughter-kill-jews-all-over-world-israel-one-week-ultimatum)¬†‚Äúyou seven million Palestinians abroad, enough warming up! There are Jews everywhere! We must attack every Jew on planet Earth ‚Äì we must slaughter and kill them, with Allah‚Äôs help.‚Äù He instructed, ‚Äú\[w\]e will die while exploding and cutting the necks and legs of the Jews. We will lacerate them and tear them to pieces, Allah willing  
  
on a broadcast on Hamas‚Äôs Al-Aqsa TV, Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahhar, after justifying the persecution and expulsions of Jews in various societies over the last millennium,[¬†proclaimed](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-leader-mahmoud-al-zahhar-justifies-persecution-jews-history-and-declares-jews-are-headed), ‚Äú\[t\]he series of expulsions continues to this day. Blood continues to be shed, martyrs continue to fall, our sons continue to hoist the banner high, and Allah willing, their expulsion from Palestine in its entirety is certain to come. We are no weaker or less honorable than the peoples that expelled and annihilated the Jews. The day we expel them is drawing near.‚Äù (13) (ISGAP, 2024)

This furthermore shows the double standards of many of the Palestine supporters who are even more ignorant about how past militaries have dealt with similar situations like these. Here are some:

1: During the reign of the red Khmer during 1979, my people, the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia in order to remove the red Khmer out of the control of Cambodia in which they have massacred 1.5 to 3 millions Cambodians, that is a genocide! This invasion is not meant to take over Cambodia but instead to remove a threat that could aim to invade Vietnam and murder my own people. (14) (Minnesota uni, NA)

  
2: During WW2, the Allied forces invaded Germany in order to fully annihalate the Nazi Germany and Hitler after they have caused the Holocaust of the Jewish people and taken over most of Europe. During the Nazi reign, more than 6 MILLION Jewish people died during the Holocaust, that is a genocide! (15) (ushmm, 2018).

A genocide would eventually lead to the large plummet of a civilian group such as during the case of the Holocaust, but until now from when the war started from Oct 7, the Gazan population never even had a meaningful drop and is instead still growing highly. This could never be clarified as a genocide because the IDF have no intent of fully murdering the Gazan population; this war is aimed to remove an existential threat that exists right next to Israel that will continue to murder its people years from now. 

**Graph of the Gazan population:** [https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza) 

  
**There are more Gazan/ Palestinians death compared to Israelis/ The IDF is combing schools, hospitals and mosques:**

What people fail to understand is that number of casualties is worthless as a measurement of ethics in a war. Israel has a much lower casualty in the war compared to Gazan because they actually care for their defense and for the livelihood of their people. Israel has invested billions into an anti air defense system known as the Iron Dome which helps to protect Israel from long and short range missile attacks from the Hamas. Furthermore, they do not use their civilians as human shields to gain pathetic empathy from idiotic teenagers like Hamas:

>""So far, what the Israeli government has said is that the effectiveness of Iron Dome is pretty high. They've been talking about a 90 per cent interception rate.""

Israel cares about the lives of the Gazan civilians, before each attacks, millions of radio warning and flyers were sent to the Gazan civilians in order to evacuate the areas that is going to be attacked (this mostly includes high civilian areas as well as civilian infrastructures such as schools and hospitals used as operating bases by the Hamas). Hamas force and often encourage the civilians to stay in order to increase the civilian casualty as this acts as publicity for the Hamas, being able to portray Israelis as monsters who kill civilians without qualms.

>""the Israel Defense Force (IDF) is also underscoring Hamas‚Äôs use of the technique. For instance, concerning the Shifa Hospital, it¬†[accused](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-articles-videos-and-more/general-articles/mris-and-rpgs-hamas-positions-headquarters-under-gaza-s-shifa-hospital/)¬†the group of ‚Äúusing the thousands of patients, doctors and staff in the building to shield its underground headquarters.‚Äù Similarly, it has¬†[highlighted](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-articles-videos-and-more/general-articles/things-aren-t-always-as-they-seem-hamas-exploitation-of-civilians-in-gaza/)¬†Hamas operations in or near civilian objects. For example, in this round of fighting, the IDF has¬†[emphasized](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-articles-videos-and-more/general-articles/things-aren-t-always-as-they-seem-hamas-exploitation-of-civilians-in-gaza/)¬†that residential neighborhoods are ‚Äúinfested with rocket launchers, entrances to underground attack tunnels, Hamas operational command centers, weapons manufacturing and storage facilities,‚Äù and ‚Äúrockets are launched out of kindergartens, weapons are stored in mosques, explosives are smuggled in with humanitarian aid and water pipes are potential rockets.‚Äù And as to the strike on the senior Hamas commander and other fighters at Jabalya refugee camp that caused extensive incidental civilian loss of life and injury, the IDF¬†[explained](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/01/gaza-refugee-camps-jabalya-israel-strike/)¬†that the targets were ‚Äúin an area where there are underground tunnels and operations in between civilian buildings.‚Äù (16) ((Schmitt, 2023)

‚ÄåThere are also evidences from eyewitnesses and Hamas doesn't even refute the claims:

>""Palestinian Islamic Jihad spokesman Tarik Salame Uda Abu, admitted that ‚ÄúGaza terror groups use all of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip.‚Äù[\[12\]](https://unwatch.org/item-7/claim/claim-46-israel-targets-hospitals-in-violation-of-international-law-in-its-post-october-7th-war/#_ftn12)¬†Similarly, in December 2023, captured Hamas lieutenant colonel Ahmed Kahlot, who doubled as the Director of Gaza‚Äôs Kamal Adwan Hospital, admitted that Hamas had converted the hospital into a military facility and held a hostage there. He added that Hamas use of Gaza hospitals for military purposes is a deliberate tactic aimed at protecting its military assets"" (17) ((*Claim 46: Israel Targets Hospitals in Violation of International Law in Its Post-October 7th War Archives - UN Watch*, 2016)

>Ismail Haniyeh, former Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority (2006- 2014), Head of Hamas Political Bureau in Gaza (since 2017) 2006: Citizens were encouraged to gather at Muhammad Baroud‚Äôs house (a prominent PRC combatant) in Jabaliya refugee camp, after the IDF issued a warning. Following the event, Haniyeh stated: ‚ÄúI believe that what has happened tonight will be a role model‚Ä¶ an example to our Palestinian people and a clear message, that the \[Zionist\] aggression will not break our will.‚Äù (18) ((*Hamas‚Äô Use of Human Shields in Gaza*, 2008)

More sickening is that with all the aids Hamas had before the war, they built tunnels under schools, hospitals and mosques to store weapons as well as acting as shelters by Israeli bombing. They intentionally let civilians up on the ground to act as collateral damage while they are comfortably safe under their little bunker. Supporters have no claims that Israel is committing war crimes against Palestinians; in fact, the Hamas are the one committing war crimes here as civilian infrastructures are not protected under Geneva convention if it is used for military purposes, not to mention that the usage of human shields is a further violation of human rights law by the Hamas; all of these are turned by a blind eye for all you Hamas supporters.

>""Loss of protection of civilian objects must be read together with the basic rule that only military objectives may be attacked. It follows that when a civilian object is used in such a way that it loses its civilian character and qualifies as a military objective, it is liable to attack. This reasoning can also be found in the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which makes it a war crime to intentionally direct attacks against civilian objects, provided they ‚Äúare not military objectives‚Äù  


We cannot use the logic that more death= the other side is the bad guys. During WW2, more than 4.3 millions Nazi Germans died compared to 386300 British soldiers . So are we saying that the British are the perpetrators in that war? (19) ((*Research Starters: Worldwide Deaths in World War II | the National WWII Museum | New Orleans*, 2024))

  
Amid the war, Israel is still providing aids to the Gazan civilians affected, there has been an upward of 1 million tonnes of aids from Israel and more than 60000 trucks sending essentials such as food, water and medicine to Gaza. Ask yourself if there's any other militaries in the world that send aids to the civilians of its enemies? Instead of using the donated funds for the betterment of its civilians in the war, Hamas invested all of them into its terrorist expenditures with more tunnels being built and more weapons and rockets manufacturing. 

>It is important to note that, according to the laws of war, countries are not required to supply their enemies with food, water, electricity, and gasoline, all of which support the enemy‚Äôs capacity to fight. Yet, even during heavy fighting, Israel continues to supply Gaza with electricity, water, food, and medicine despite having endured the most brutal massacre ever to occur on its soil.¬† But for the brutality of the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas, Israel would not have cut off such supplies for a week.  
  
To date,¬†over¬†[20,00 trucks on the ground have delivered over 375,000 tons of aid](https://govextra.gov.il/cogat/humanitarian-efforts/home/#:~:text=COGAT%20(Coordinator%20of%20the%20Government,coordination%20with%20the%20international%20community.). That includes 240,960 tons of food, 27,760 tons of water, 19,510 tons of medical supplies, 39,080 tons of shelter equipment, 200 tanks of fuel, and 385 tanks of cooking gas.   
In addition, the Gaza Strip has been given billions of dollars in humanitarian aid over the last several years - including over $400 million from the U.S. and $1 billion from Qatar. Hamas has diverted much of that humanitarian aid intended for the Palestinian people for its own purposes,¬†[including funding its terrorist activities, such as building over 350 miles of terror tunnels and rocket factories](https://www.aipac.org/resources/hamas-abuse-of-humanitarian-aid-hurts-gazans-xly2w-3pzjg-xld3h).

**4: Hamas is a resistant group and is fighting back the illegal occupation of Israel/ The war started long before Oct 7**

The war starting long before Oct 7 has some stands into it. Did it start from when during the 1948 war after the defeated Arab exiled more than 800 000 Jewish away from their homes and lands? Did it start during the Hebron massacre in which 67 Jewish people were killed by Arab protestors? Did it start during the Haifa massacre where Arabs beat 39 Jews to death? Did it start during Ben Yehuda street bombing where 55 Jews were killed by Arabs terrorists? Did it start on over 10 years in Gaza where Hamas fired more than 4000 missiles for no reason other wanting for the death of Jews in Israel? Did it start during the Oct 7th when animals called Hamas invaded Israel and killed more than 2000 Jewish civilians including women and children?

  
It is true that the war started long before Oct 7 and the Arabs can list me a river of massacres of Arabs people, and I can list them a river of massacres of Jewish people. But one thing that we will not turn a blind eye in this post is the attack on Oct 7th. The arguments regarding past conflicts between Palestinians and Israel is a tenuous argument to idiotically rationalize the vile actions of the Hamas animals during Oct 7th. They raided a music festival representing peace and shot down 380 of young teenagers and people just wanting to have a fun time with their friends (21) ((Kershner, 2024). They raided homes of innocent Jewish families, killed babies and children in their sleep, raped teenagers and mothers in front of their families, burnt babies in stoves, ending hundreds of families and taking hundreds hostages. When I first looked up details about the Oct 7th massacre, I couldn't fully comprehend how any of you sick minded individuals can support and argue for these actions.

**She goes on to detail how the men cut off parts of the victim's body during the assault.**

>**""They sliced her breast and threw it on the street,"" she says. ""They were playing with it.""**

>**The victim was passed to another man in uniform, she continues.**

>**""He penetrated her, and shot her in the head before he finished. He didn't even pick up his pants; he shoots and ejaculates.""**

>**One man we spoke to from the festival site said he heard the ""noises and screams of people being murdered, raped, decapitated"".  (22) (BBC NEWS, 2023)**

I simply cannot support Hamas nor any of of you Palestinian supporters cause the people among those massacres could've been my mother, my father, my siblings, grandparents, my girlfriend and others. You people supporting Hamas are supporting these disgusting crimes and you got the audacity to defend it with shallow and weak-ass arguments that I have fully rebuked such as:

\-Hamas are fighting back their colonizers and for their freedoms

\-Israel is committing war crimes against the Gaza Strip

\-The war started way before Oct 7th

Just to clarify, resistant fighters do not aim to provoke and murder civilians of their enemies! Resistant fighters fight against their oppressors and only their oppressors. It is by no doubt that Hamas is nothing but a group of cowards terrorists who deserve no mercy upon their death; just imagine yourself being among those crowds in Israel, either in the Nova music festival or your own home, being killed or watching your children or wife being raped before murdered before your own eye. Or imagine yourself being the family member of one of the hostages kidnapped by the Hamas where they are kept under tunnels and treated like dogs just as a pathetic leverage used by the Hamas. Where is your humanity?

>The UN General Assembly tends to use the following in its pronouncements on terrorism:

>""Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them

>

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the whole trend of ""Free Palestine"" to me or any rational human beings is a disgusting trend being built on a tenuous pillar of stupidity, hatred and collapse of moral behaviors by the majority of Arab populations or misled individuals being walked like dogs from the media. I shall have no empathy for any of the Hamas terrorists being killed in the Gaza, I shall have no empathy for the supporters of Hamas in both Gaza and worldwide; Hamas is a terrorist organization that I believe the sooner they are destroyed, the more peaceful it will serve the world moving forward. I will make no donations into the Gaza strip where most of those money will be used to fund the activities of all the terrorists by building longer tunnels, better weapons and better range rockets. The only stakeholder I truly feel sorry for in this war are children who are displaced by the damage of this war who had no say or no involvement into the conflict and I hope that after the war end, we can focus on rebuilding the Gaza strip and improve the living standards of Gazan just like how we rebuilt Europe after WW2.

**JULES**

My hands press against the headboard to prevent hitting it as the bed creaks from thrusts accompanied by grunts. It lasts far too long before the moans of ecstasy assault my ears. Of course, they didn‚Äôt come from me. Carl fucks like a drill sergeant, in and out, and onto the next thing. There‚Äôs no romance. Intensity. No eye contact. Nothing but Carl‚Äôs aim toward his own release. I like sex, except with him. He‚Äôs a self-serving vanilla, and his natural smell of car fumes adds to the displeasure.

Carl rolls off, catching a last second glance of me, and leaves to relieve himself. When he returns, he slips on his underwear and jeans, unzipped and unbuttoned, and drops into the antique chair positioned by the window. I found the chair at an antique market on the side of the road and fell in love with it. All of its beautiful wood finish and S-scroll legs, maroon velvet seat and backing, along with gilded studs. I admire it more than Carl. Finally, I look at him. He almost appears angelic the way the light beams through the sheer white curtains. Almost. Carl sits back in the chair while I pull the covers around my breasts and rest my back against the headboard.

It doesn‚Äôt take long for him to break the silence. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù One of my brows cocks up. His hand flaps between him and me. ‚ÄúThis. Us. Pretend like I want a future with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, but a fuck wasn‚Äôt out of the question.‚Äù

He leans forward in the chair. ‚ÄúYou know, Jules, your swearing is a turnoff. Among other things.‚Äù

I roll my eyes at him and return my focus to the antique chair. I bought it prior to meeting Carl, and although he hated the vintage style, I refused to part with it. But Carl, I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôll have a hard time parting with him. It‚Äôs not his lean muscle build, short blond hair, and green eyes that are a turnoff. It‚Äôs his personality. He lacks a sense of humor, which got lost somewhere between our first hello and our first date. It‚Äôs best he doesn‚Äôt laugh though, because he sounds like a hyena.

When we met, I made the first move, which he shut down. He said he wanted to get to know me before we slept together. So, I waited. And waited. On our tenth date, he decided it was time for us to become intimate, as he put it. I should have known then this relationship was doomed. Not only that, but he has an ever-growing dislike list about me he tends to regurgitate whenever things don‚Äôt go his way‚Ä¶even though it went his way minutes ago. The ache for an orgasm between my thighs is proof.

‚ÄúAnd another thing‚Ä¶‚Äù Carl‚Äôs voice brings me back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of your moods. One day you‚Äôre chatty Cathy, and the next, you‚Äôre a frustrated bitch.‚Äù I let out an animated sigh. He points at me. ‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm talking about. You‚Äôre acting as if you don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not prepared for another lecture about the list of things I do that bother you.‚Äù

He shoots out of the chair as if Satan burned his ass. ‚ÄúJesus, Jules! The list keeps growing and you don‚Äôt do a damn thing to change.‚Äù

I smooth down the sheet against my body. It‚Äôs 400 thread count is how I assume sleeping on a cloud would feel like‚Ä¶if I were to imagine the experience of a thick, puffy cloud.

‚ÄúAre you listening to me, Jules?‚Äù

My voice levels. ‚ÄúThe entire neighborhood is listening, Carl.‚Äù His hands are fisted on his hips. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me? Are you upset I didn‚Äôt moan enough? Forget to thank you for a not-so-fun time?‚Äù

He begins to pace, running a hand through his hair, and when he does this, it‚Äôs serious. I‚Äôm not sure my heart can take another hit. His dismemberment of my character hurts. I just don‚Äôt know how to be the kind of woman he wants me to be.

‚ÄúI had planned to tell you yesterday, but then, well‚Ä¶you looked so hot in your dress. Anyway, this was supposed to take place yesterday.‚Äù

Wrapping the sheet around me as I rise, I stand in front of him, eyes almost level, and say, ‚ÄúThis is me, Carl. I‚Äôm the same Jules from when you first met me. Apparently, you are more absorbed in my fa√ßade instead of my true self.‚Äù

For the first in a long time, his eyes dig deep into mine, searching for something which doesn‚Äôt exist. After realizing this, he swipes up his shirt from the floor, pulls it over his head, and reaches for his shoes. My hand latches onto the top of the sheet while I shift to my other foot. He‚Äôs tossing clothes into a duffle bag and shaking his head. In the washroom, the cabinet slams against the wall, there‚Äôs clattering, and he‚Äôs back to tossing items into the bag.

He zips it and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but we‚Äôre done. You can keep your moods. I need someone who‚Äôs stable, consistent. Someone willing to meet me halfway. I‚Äôll get the rest of my things later.‚Äù

I swallow down the sadness because Carl doesn‚Äôt deserve to see my cracks. He has no problem pointing out my flaws, yet I‚Äôve never introduced him to his own. There was a time when I cared about him, so I brushed off his shortcomings until they were specks of dust buried deep under the rug. All his messiness went unspoken. His lack of consideration never uttered. I ignored Carl‚Äôs proverbial sarcasm at my expense. Over time, it made our relationship hollow. A cavern of empty promises and lost hope.

Carl is at the door, holding the bag, and gives me a last glance before leaving. I don‚Äôt chase him or beg him to stay. His stiff back disappears behind the door. Another relationship disintegrates. As usual, my friendships and romantic relationships go up in puffs of smoke. I know there‚Äôs something wrong with me aside from depression‚Äîa shortage in my brain. How does one fix themselves when they can‚Äôt pinpoint the problem? Some days I‚Äôm an explosive volcano, and others, I‚Äôm buried under the lava, my focus solely on breathing.

There‚Äôs no time to worry about another failed connection. I gather the droppings he left on the floor, toss them in the garbage, and start getting ready for work. The ensuite washroom is a bit darker without a window. Still, the airiness of white is inviting for the large shower and two-sink vanity, which I take full advantage of this morning to wash away Carl.

Outside my office building, I stand to the side, sipping my coffee and contemplating my place in life. School wasn‚Äôt for me, so after many attempts at finding a job, I came upon a low-level magazine position. My boss Fred found me attractive enough to hire and make me a writer. With no experience other than my enjoyment of writing, Fred lets me write all kinds of articles, even when the editors curse and complain to him. I‚Äôm grateful for the job, but I‚Äôm unsure if this is my forever.

My coffee spills onto the ground when my arm is bumped. I hold the cup away to prevent it from splashing on my clothes. My frown turns into a smile when I see Fred.

‚ÄúSorry, Jules. I should have nudged your other arm.‚Äù

His underwater laughter caused by years of cigarette abuse brings unwanted attention. Some colleagues pass by, sneer at the favoritism, and walk into the building. Fred disregards them, taking out a used handkerchief to wipe off my coffee cup and hand.

I back away and toss the cup into the trash bin. ‚ÄúNo worries, Fred. I was about done with it anyways.‚Äù

He crushes the handkerchief back into his bloated pants pockets and holds out an arm toward the door. ‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù

I walk ahead of him, knowing he‚Äôs checking me out. His wandering eyes are never subtle. Instead of going to my desk, Fred invites me into his office. All I can do is hope he doesn‚Äôt try anything again. His hands tend to graze, pat, or touch me. I haven‚Äôt said anything because I like the job and experience.

His modest frame plops down on the chair as fingers whisp aside the lone hairs on top of his head. I take a seat on the other side of the desk. A barrier against his roaming hands.

‚ÄúJules, you‚Äôve been with us for quite some time. I‚Äôve given you countless opportunities.‚Äù

I perk up and start firing away. ‚ÄúDid I do something wrong? I appreciate everything you‚Äôve done for me. What can I‚Äî?‚Äù

Fred lifts his hands in a stop position and says, ‚ÄúSlow down, Jules. We‚Äôre only talking. It‚Äôs my job to make sure things run smoothly at this magazine.‚Äù

My nerves are sparked. ‚ÄúI understand. I do. You‚Äôre a great boss.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, now, calm down. This is a chat about your performance and expectations. You‚Äôre not getting fired.‚Äù

I glance around the room, and when he bows his head, I adjust my breasts so they‚Äôre bloating out of my blouse. When he raises his head, his eyes zero in on them, he clears his throat and says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no secret some of the employees have been somewhat discouraged by your work. I‚Äôve placated several of the people making the complaints until now. Some of them went over my head regarding you, which is why we‚Äôre having this discussion.‚Äù

This can‚Äôt be happening today. First Carl and now my job? What the hell? I can‚Äôt prevent my lips from quivering, my breasts heaving up and down, capturing Fred‚Äôs attention. I swap a tissue from the box sitting on his desk and blow my nose.

‚ÄúEverything will be fine, Jules.‚Äù He comes around to pat my shoulder, and somehow his hand drifts onto my breast. I still, our eyes lock, until he moves it to my arm, taking the chair next to me. My knees are his next target as he rubs them in a circular motion.

‚ÄúNo need to worry about something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. As of today, I need to put you on probation.‚Äù My eyes widen while my mouth opens. Fred stops me from saying anything. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a trial run. But I have a solution.‚Äù

He licks his lips while he gives my knees one last rub and sits back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give you the biggest opportunity of your life. You‚Äôre going to do a ‚Äòday-in-the-life‚Äô of The Coven. The biggest band today.‚Äù

I lean forward, my breasts pouring out of my blouse. Fred glances at my mouth, and swallows down an accumulation of saliva. My back crashes against the chair when he kisses me on the lips. The nicotine habit withered his mouth‚Äîskin puckered and rough against the softness of mine. He backs away, keeping his hands on my thighs. We say nothing for a moment, letting the instance evaporate.

‚ÄúThis will work, Jules. For two weeks, you‚Äôll travel with the band, and then write an article about a day in the life of The Coven.‚Äù

The Coven is the biggest international band on the planet. Their music is deep, moving, and the diverse songs set them apart from other bands. My favorite song of theirs is Butterfly Winds, which always evokes emotions in me.

I pat my lips with my fingertips, eyes remaining on him, and say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt thank you enough for this, Fred.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a make-or-break opportunity. If you produce an outstanding piece, you‚Äôre off probation, but if you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes devour my body, and he readjusts in his seat to hide his arousal. It isn‚Äôt working. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt, then I‚Äôll have to fire you.‚Äù He looks into my eyes. ‚ÄúNeither of us want that, so make sure this is the best thing you‚Äôve ever produced.‚Äù

I nod and smile. ‚ÄúI will. I promise I‚Äôll make you proud.‚Äù

We sit there staring at each other while his hands slide up my thighs, back to my knees, and fall away. I stand and move behind the chair to stop anymore intrusions.

‚ÄúWhen do I leave?‚Äù

Fred walks over to his desk, puts on his glasses, and reads a short memo. ‚ÄúTomorrow.‚Äù He gives me a once over. ‚ÄúIs that too early?‚Äù

I go to the door as I say, ‚ÄúNot at all. I‚Äôll prep now, pack tonight, and meet the band tomorrow.‚Äù The door opens and my eyebrows knit together as I ask, ‚ÄúWhere am I meeting them?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt their bus. I‚Äôll send you the address.‚Äù

Before I close the door, I say, ‚ÄúThanks so much, Fred. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.‚Äù

In the bathroom, I squeal from excitement, and place my hand against my chest once realization sets in. I can‚Äôt believe Fred felt me up and kissed me. I let out a shocked laugh. It‚Äôs never gone this far. A peek here and there is fine, but he just about molested me in his office. And I let him. For what? To keep my job?

Hell yes! I can‚Äôt believe he gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. To meet the members of The Coven. I‚Äôve been following their careers for a while. The lead singer, Callan Crothers, started the band with the lead guitarist, Ace Dilliard. They played at parties, and added bass player, Thomas Capers to the mix. The band progressed to small gigs and seedy bars. It wasn‚Äôt until Miles Nash, the drummer and handsomest of them all, joined that the band took off. They went from small bars to arenas overnight, which spread throughout the States and into Europe. Dubbed ‚ÄúThe Atomic Band‚Äù, The Coven has been going strong for several years. And I‚Äôm going to be traveling with them.

I recently got my hands on the MX Master 3 mouse from Logitech, and I'm impressed with its performance. This Mac-specific version is a great fit for Apple users looking to boost their productivity.

The mouse feels great to use, with a comfortable shape that lets me work for hours without strain. I really like the speed and quiet operation of the scroll wheel. It's very precise and moves smoothly. The customizable buttons are handy too - I've set them up to fit my workflow perfectly.

https://preview.redd.it/83gm1gzqpf4e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b377b909093f9c8edfd5ecadd4de21f05ed19b9

The MX Master 3 works well on many surfaces, even glass. This is useful when I'm working away from my desk. The battery life is also good - I only need to charge it every couple of months.

One small issue is that it's a bit pricey. But for the features and build quality, I think it's worth it for heavy computer users. The mouse also takes some time to get used to all its functions.

# Bottom Line

The Logitech MX Master 3 is a top-notch mouse for Mac users. Its comfort, speed, and customization make it great for long work sessions.



# Overview of the Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac

I've been using the MX Master 3 for Mac for a few weeks now, and it's impressive. This mouse fits perfectly in my hand and feels great to use all day. The scroll wheel is super smooth and quiet. I love how I can switch between my Mac and iPad easily. The buttons are easy to reach and can be set up for different apps. Battery life is great - I only charge it about once a month. The Space Grey color matches my MacBook nicely. While it's pricier than basic mice, I think it's worth it for the comfort and features. The software takes some time to learn, but it lets me work faster once set up. Overall, this is a top-notch mouse for Mac users who want the best.

# Optimized for macOS and iPadOS Compatibility

I found the MX Master 3 to work great with my Mac and iPad. It paired easily with both devices via Bluetooth. On my MacBook, I could use all the buttons and scroll wheels right away. The mouse also works with iPadOS, though with fewer features. I liked using the side scrolling wheel to swipe between apps on my iPad. The Space Gray color matches my other Apple gear nicely. Logitech's software let me set up custom shortcuts for different Mac apps, which sped up my workflow. While it works well with Apple devices, I wish it had full iPad support with all buttons usable.

# MagSpeed Scroll Wheel for Ultrafast Scrolling

The MagSpeed scroll wheel on this Logitech mouse blew me away. It's incredibly fast and precise, letting me zip through long documents effortlessly. I found it much quieter than regular scroll wheels too. The wheel has a satisfying feel, with just the right amount of resistance.

I really appreciated being able to switch between ratchet and free-spin modes. Ratchet mode gave me precision for things like spreadsheets, while free-spin was great for quickly scrolling websites. The wheel is made of stainless steel, which felt premium under my finger.

While the speed took some getting used to at first, I now can't imagine using a regular mouse. It's made a big difference in my productivity. The only small downside is that the wheel can be a bit slippery if your hands are sweaty.

# Ergonomic Design and Intuitive Controls

The MX Master 3's shape feels great in my hand. I can use it for hours without discomfort. The thumb rest and curved body fit my palm nicely. The buttons and scroll wheel are easy to reach. I love the side scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. It's smooth and precise. The main scroll wheel is fast and quiet. It switches between click-to-click and free-spin modes automatically. This is super useful for both detailed work and quickly scanning long pages. The customizable buttons let me set up shortcuts for my most-used tasks. Overall, the mouse is comfy and efficient to use all day long.

# Seamless Multi-Computer Workflow

I love how easy it is to work across multiple Macs with this mouse. The Flow feature lets me move my cursor between computers seamlessly. I can even copy and paste text and files from one Mac to another. It's super handy when I'm using my MacBook and iMac side by side. The mouse connects to up to 3 devices via Bluetooth. Switching between them is quick with a button press. This really boosts my productivity when I need to use different Macs for different tasks. The customizable buttons also help streamline my workflow on each device.

# Advanced Customization Options

I found the MX Master 3's customization features really impressive. The mouse lets me set up different profiles for various apps I use. I can assign specific functions to buttons that make sense for each program. For example, in Photoshop I set the thumb wheel to adjust brush size. The Logitech Options software makes it easy to create these custom setups. I like being able to fine-tune the tracking speed and scrolling behavior too. The gesture button adds another layer of control - I use it with mouse movements to switch between desktops quickly. While there are lots of options, it did take me some time to find the perfect settings for my workflow. Overall, the customization really helps boost my productivity once dialed in.

# High-Precision Tracking on Any Surface

I was impressed by the MX Master 3's tracking abilities. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, even glass. Its 4000 DPI sensor is super precise, letting me hit exactly the right pixel every time. I noticed a big difference compared to regular mice - it's much faster and more accurate. This makes detailed work like photo editing easier. The tracking is consistent no matter what surface I use it on. I can work comfortably on my desk, couch, or even a glass coffee table without issues. It's great not having to worry about mousepads anymore. The precise tracking also helps reduce hand strain since I don't have to make repetitive small movements.

# Pros and Cons

After using the Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac for a while, I've got a good feel for its strengths and weaknesses. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Ergonomic design feels great in my hand, even after long use.
* Customizable buttons and gestures boost my productivity.
* Works on any surface, including glass.
* Easy switching between multiple Mac devices.

I've found the MX Master 3 to be a solid choice for Mac users who spend a lot of time on their computers. The comfort and features make a big difference in my daily work. But it's not perfect for everyone, especially if you're on a tight budget or prefer a smaller mouse. The pros outweigh the cons for me, but your mileage may vary based on your needs and preferences.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using the MX Master 3 for a while now, and it's clear why so many people love it. The mouse has a strong 4.6 out of 5 stars rating from nearly 6,000 users on Amazon. Most reviewers praise its comfort, especially for long work sessions. The scroll wheel gets a lot of positive attention, with users liking its smooth and fast operation. Many appreciate how well it connects to multiple devices, making it great for those who switch between computers often. Some users mention it took time to get used to all the features, but they felt it was worth it. A few noted the price is high, but they think the quality justifies the cost. Overall, people seem very happy with this mouse, especially Mac users who find it works seamlessly with their systems.

# Conclusion

I've spent a good amount of time using the MX Master 3 for Mac, and it's clear why this mouse is so popular. The ergonomic design feels great during long work sessions, and the customizable buttons are a big plus. While it's pricier than some options, the smooth scrolling and precision make it worth considering for Mac users who spend a lot of time at their computer. The ability to switch between devices is handy too. It's not perfect - the software takes some getting used to - but overall, I've found it to be a solid upgrade from standard mice. If you're looking to boost your productivity on Mac, this mouse could be a smart choice.",1,1733144954.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Looking for a mouse that can keep up with your work and play? I've been testing out the MX Master 3S from Logitech, and it's a game-changer.

This mouse fits like a glove in my hand. Its shape is perfect for long hours of use. The buttons are right where I need them. I can work on any surface, even glass. The quiet clicks are a nice touch - they don't disturb others around me.

https://preview.redd.it/0fzugmajpf4e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2067a1de910139b86d5f90f49bad4a64e15cdf43

The scroll wheel is super fast and smooth. I can zip through long documents in no time. The battery lasts for ages - I only need to charge it every few weeks. It connects to up to three devices, which is great for switching between my work and home computers.

The software lets me set up the buttons just how I like. I can even copy and paste between different computers. It's a bit pricey, but the comfort and features make it worth it for me.

# Bottom Line

The MX Master 3S is a top-notch mouse that makes work easier and more comfortable. If you spend a lot of time on your computer, it's a solid choice.



# Overview of Logitech MX Master 3S

I've been testing out the MX Master 3S mouse, and it's packed with cool features. This wireless mouse tracks on any surface, even glass. The new 8K DPI sensor lets me adjust sensitivity to my liking. I love the quiet clicks - they're 90% quieter than before but still feel satisfying. The MagSpeed scroll wheel is super fast and precise. It's comfy to use for hours thanks to the ergonomic design. I can customize buttons and set up profiles for different apps. One neat trick is controlling multiple computers and moving files between them. It connects to 3 devices via Bluetooth or the USB receiver. The mouse works with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS and Linux. Overall, it's a solid upgrade that boosts productivity.

# Revolutionary Quiet Clicks

I was blown away by the MX Master 3S's quiet clicks. The mouse buttons feel solid and responsive, but make 90% less noise than before. This is a game-changer for open offices or late-night work sessions. I can click away without disturbing others nearby. The tactile feedback is still there, so I don't miss out on that satisfying feel. It's impressive how Logitech achieved this without sacrificing performance. The quiet clicks pair nicely with the smooth, silent MagSpeed scrolling wheel. Together, they make for an ultra-quiet mousing experience that's hard to beat.

# Any-Surface Tracking Up to 8K DPI

I was amazed by this mouse's tracking abilities. The MX Master 3S works on almost any surface, even glass. I tried it on my desk, a magazine, and even my glass coffee table - it tracked perfectly every time. The 8K DPI sensor is super precise. I could move the cursor across my 4K monitor with tiny hand movements. For everyday use, I found a lower DPI setting more comfortable. But it's nice to have the option to crank it up when needed. The tracking is smooth and responsive no matter what surface or sensitivity I used. This level of precision makes detailed work like photo editing much easier.

# MagSpeed Electromagnetic Scrolling

I was blown away by the MX Master 3S's scrolling. It's incredibly fast and precise. The wheel moves smoothly and quietly. I can zip through long documents in seconds. For detailed work, I switch to a slower, more precise mode. It's great for spreadsheets and design tasks. The wheel feels solid and well-made. It's a big step up from standard mice. The scrolling speed is customizable, which I found useful. It took me a little time to get used to, but now I wouldn't go back. This feature alone makes the mouse worth it for me. It's especially good for people who work with lots of data or long documents.

# Ergonomic Contour Design

The MX Master 3S feels great in my hand. Its shape fits naturally, reducing strain during long work sessions. I love how my thumb rests comfortably on the side, with easy access to extra buttons. The mouse's gentle curves support my palm and fingers well. While using it, I noticed less wrist fatigue compared to standard mice. The soft-touch coating adds grip without feeling sticky. For most hand sizes, this design works well, but those with very small hands might find it a bit large. Overall, the ergonomics of this mouse make it a joy to use all day long.

# Multi-Device Flow Control

I found the MX Master 3S really shines when working across multiple devices. The Flow feature lets me seamlessly move my cursor between up to three computers, even copying and pasting content between them. I simply slide the mouse to the edge of one screen and it jumps to the next device. It's super smooth and works great between Windows and Mac. This saves me tons of time when I'm bouncing between my work laptop and personal desktop. The mouse connects via Bluetooth or the included USB receiver. Switching between devices is quick and easy with a button on the bottom. While it's not perfect for everyone's setup, I think most users will find the multi-device capabilities really useful for boosting productivity.

# Environmentally Conscious Construction

I was impressed by the MX Master 3S's eco-friendly design. Logitech used recycled plastic in parts of the mouse, which is a step towards reducing waste. The packaging was minimal and made from recycled materials too. This mouse is built to last, with durable components that should hold up well over time. That means less electronic waste in the long run. While not perfect, it's nice to see Logitech making efforts to be more sustainable with their products. The long battery life also helps cut down on battery waste. Overall, the MX Master 3S strikes a good balance between performance and environmental responsibility.

# Pros and Cons

This mouse has changed the way I work at my computer. Let's break down what I love and what could be better.

# Pros

* Super comfortable to use for hours
* Works on any surface, even glass
* Quiet clicks won't disturb others
* Fast, precise scrolling
* Can connect to multiple devices
* Customizable buttons for different apps

# Cons

* Pricey compared to basic mice
* Might be too big for small hands
* Software needed for full features
* Scroll wheel can feel loose to some users

I've found the MX Master 3S to be a game-changer for my daily work. The ergonomic shape fits my hand like a glove, and I can use it all day without discomfort. It glides smoothly on any surface, which is great when I move between my desk and couch.

The quiet clicks are a nice touch, especially when I'm working late and don't want to bother anyone. The scrolling is fast and smooth, making it easy to zip through long documents.

I love that I can connect it to my laptop and tablet, switching between them easily. The customizable buttons are handy for my most-used functions in different apps.

On the downside, it's not cheap. If you're on a tight budget, this might not be the mouse for you. It's also quite large, so if you have small hands, it might not be the best fit.

You'll need to install software to get the most out of the customization features. Some users might find this annoying. Lastly, the scroll wheel can feel a bit loose when in free-spin mode, which takes some getting used to.

# Analyzing Customer Reviews

I've spent a lot of time reading through customer feedback on the MX Master 3S, and it's clear this mouse has made a big impression. Many users praise its comfortable ergonomic design, perfect for long work or gaming sessions. The precision and ability to work on any surface are huge pluses.

Buyers love the smooth scrolling and customizable buttons. Battery life gets high marks too - some report only needing to charge it every few months with heavy use.

While most reviews are glowing, a few users with smaller hands mentioned it took time to adjust to the larger size. The price was a concern for some, but most felt it was worth the investment.

From my experience using it, I agree with the positive reviews. The MX Master 3S really does live up to the hype in terms of comfort, features, and performance.

# Is It Worth the Investment? Conclusion

After using the MX Master 3S for a while, I can say it's a solid choice for those who spend long hours at their computer. The quiet clicks and smooth scrolling make work more pleasant. Its ergonomic shape helps reduce hand strain. The customizable buttons and cross-device use are big pluses for productivity.

While it's pricier than basic mice, the comfort and features justify the cost for heavy users. The build quality is top-notch, and it works on any surface. Battery life is great too.

I found the mouse comfortable and responsive. It improved my workflow. For casual users, it might be overkill. But for professionals or anyone who uses a computer all day, it's a worthy investment that can boost comfort and efficiency.",1,1733144882.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I have been here for 7 months and I was promoted one month in because the turnover rate is so high. My promotion landed me a 25 cent raise which is still barely enough. I make $14.25 an hour and I still work as a barista on the weekends to sustain myself. I make way more at my barista job for half the hours. I think my company is going bankrupt and they have laid off 6 people. I am now juggling two positions with no pay raise. I am also cold calling people for money and the pressure to collect money has been high for the past few months. My supervisor has created a spreadsheet where all of us compete to collect the most cash and it is terrible. We are forced to cold call for 1 hour a day, and it seems like books are even the focus of the company anymore. We were also all asked for our email passwords before the layoffs which was odd. The layoffs were conducted terrible and u professionally and my supervisors canceled the company meeting so they wouldn‚Äôt have to address the layoffs. My supervisor also mentioned that she doesn‚Äôt even know who works here anymore‚Ä¶ the management here is bad. I am going to email my supervisors my two weeks notice next week and just get more hours at the coffee shop while still applying to career oriented jobs.

I wanted to share my journey of becoming more productive and the strategies that actually worked for me. I know we've all been there - struggling to get things done, feeling overwhelmed, and watching Netflix instead of tackling our to-do list.

A few months ago, I was in the same boat. I'd start my day with great intentions but end up procrastinating and feeling guilty about it. That's when I discovered something that completely changed my approach to productivity.

First off, I learned that trying to overhaul your entire life overnight doesn't work. Instead, focus on tiny changes - what James Clear calls ""atomic habits."" I actually came across his audiobook recently (you can check it out for free here: https://athometouch.com/atomichabits), and it completely changed my perspective on building better habits.

Here's what I've learned about becoming more productive:

1. Start ridiculously small
Instead of saying ""I'll work for 3 hours,"" start with just 5 minutes. It sounds too easy, but that's the point. Once you start, you'll often want to continue.

2. Design your environment
I removed social media apps from my phone and created a dedicated workspace. Your environment shapes your behavior more than willpower ever will.

3. Stack your habits
Connect new habits to existing ones. For example, I started doing 5 minutes of planning right after my morning coffee. It's easier to build on existing routines than create new ones from scratch.

4. Track your progress
Use a simple habit tracker (I just use a notebook). There's something satisfying about marking off completed tasks.

5. Create systems, not goals
Instead of saying ""I want to be productive,"" create a system like ""I'll work on important tasks from 9-11 AM every day.""

The biggest game-changer for me was understanding that productivity isn't about doing more things - it's about doing the right things consistently. It's about building systems that make good behaviors inevitable and bad behaviors impossible.

One thing that really helped me understand this better was listening to Atomic Habits on my commute. Since Audible offers a free trial, you can actually listen to it without spending anything. The audiobook goes deep into the science of habit formation and provides practical strategies you can use immediately.

Remember, productivity isn't about massive changes or superhuman discipline. It's about small improvements, consistently applied. Start with tiny changes, create supportive environments, and build systems that make success easier.

Eu sempre fui um aluno mediano, sobreviviva estudando o m√≠nimo e indo na m√©dia ou um pouco acima, mas sempre que eu precisava de pontos ru tinha extrema facilidade de sentar e estudar por 2-3h e fechar as provas basicamente. Sempre chamado de inteligente, esperto e afins, mas nunca me senti assim de fato. Acontece que com pandemia em 2020, meu primeiro ano do ensino m√©dio, eu deixei at√© de fazer o b√°sico. Estudei em escola particular a vida toda, e l√° tem um peso diferente para as mat√©rias e etc, por√©m eles atrasaram at√© mar√ßo mais ou menos para iniciar a aula online, e ainda veio um sistema porco, usando uma plataforma p√©ssima e professores que mal sabiam criar pasta no computador, al√©m de que uma prova de vestibular seriado na minha cidade havia sido cancelada indefinidamente (tipo um enem, mas para cada ano de ensino m√©dio uma prova ao inv√©s de no fim).

Os primeiros meses eu fiz as aulas e estudava o mesmo m√≠nimo, mas lentamente passei a jogar depois das aulas, a virar noites e at√© a jogar durante as aulas. Tudo era divertido, n√£o me arrependo tanto, foi uma √©poca boa. Acontece que ao fim do ano, l√° por outubro, marcaram a data desse vestibular para o come√ßo do ano que vem, e eu fiquei meio despreocupado. Comprei um cursinho de 2 meses online e tentei fazer ele com afinco, mas depois de umas 2 semanas cansei dessa rotina e fui deixando acumular, at√© chegar o ponto de que n√£o queria mais fazer o cursinho.

Fui mal nessa primeira prova, uns 55% da nota total, mas ainda era recuper√°vel ao longo das pr√≥ximas 2 provas. 

Agora em 2021, ainda tudo EAD, piorei, fiquei despreocupado ao extremo e passei at√© junho sem fazer nada produtivo, at√© correndo risco de reprovar na escola. Caiu a ficha para mim quando marcaram a prova no come√ßo de 2022 e vo o edital de biologia. Nesse momento, defini que iria dar meu melhor. 
Eu tinha a rotina de acordar, jogar overwatch, jogar minecraft a tarde at√© a madrugada e acordar para marcar presen√ßa na aula, mas ainda jogando. Eu mudei tudo, passei a acordar 5h, estudar at√© 12h, fazer pausa para almo√ßo de 30min e voltar estudar at√© 21h, momento que eu parava e dormia. Fiz isso at√© janeiro, passei meu anivers√°rio assim, ano novo, anivers√°rio da minha m√£e. Sem jogar, sem falar com meus amigos, eles at√© pensaram que eu tinha morrido (amigos online).

Quando estava para chegar a prova, eu tive um sentimento daquela √©poca do ensino fundamental. Ir fazer a prova com confian√ßa de que eu sei, ent√£o t√° tranquilo. Eu estudei tanto que tinha um resumo de biologia feito no word de 80 p√°ginas, tudo anotado de forma linda, coesiva, organizado, visualmente e teoricamente, minha professora particular de biologia at√© falou de eu publicar ele de forma oficial. Foi um dos maiores orgulhos da minha vida esse resumo.

Quando chegou o resultado da prova... zerei biologia. Eu fiquei t√£o arrasado com isso que basicamente desisti por alguns meses de comer e fazer outras coisas, e voltei para o lazer.

2022 foi presencial, eu parecia um heremita. Tinha mudado de escola, fazer o terceiro ano em uma que eu gostei de estudar para esse vestibular, logo o ambiente era de eu n√£o conhecia ningu√©m e ningu√©m me conhecia. Eu ficava no canto, quieto, a aula toda e sempre mexendo no celular quando n√£o tinha aula. E quando chegava em casa eu jogava ou dormia.

Chegou o fim do ano, fiz a prova e em janeiro vi que n√£o passei para nada. Nenhuma vaga de faculdade. Rapidamente procurei algumas privadas de direito (curso que eu queria) para me inscrever, e entrei em uma com alto desconto, mais de 75%. Eu fiz um primeiro per√≠odo fant√°stico, decidi me dedicar e fui o melhor aluno do per√≠odo, mas nas f√©rias algo que iria mudar minha vida come√ßou: 
Namoro. Sempre fui um cara recluso, sem interesse de namorar (culpa de anos de v√≠cio em pornografia e nojo de mim, corpo e etc), mas conheci uma garota online perfeita. Ela era inteligente, divertida e tinha gostoa parecidos comigo, e me apaixonei como nunca antes. Passei os meses fazendo muita merda, merda a ponto de perfil falso para tentar juntar ela comigo (ela sabe de tudo isso, me perdoou e eu mudei, sei que fiz muito errado).
Meu segundo per√≠odo foi muito ruim, mas o pior vem para o terceiro.

Em janeiro, conheci outra garota, mas essa tinha tantos problemas como eu. Ela ficava com muitos rapazes e me fez de ot√°rio algumas vezes, mas acredito que ela estava na mesma situa√ß√£o merda que eu, por isso n√£o a detesto, mas o fato √© que ela me trazia agonia, me fez acreditar que eu tinha que comprovar a verdade em tudo que eu dissesse, a ponto de eu escrever cada segundo do meu dia para ela n√£o duvidar de mim. Resumidamente, meu tempo com ela de janeiro at√© junho de 2024 foi muito turbulento, ela v√°rias vezes tinha surtos e dizia que ia se... voc√™s sabem. Essa press√£o toda, eu queria ser perfeito para ela, e por isso fui feito de trouxa por ela que tinha outros 3-4 contatinhos que brincava intimamente e romanticamente. 

Durante esse per√≠odo com ela minha vida deu v√°rios twists: minha m√£e fico extremamente doente, meu pai queria me expulsar de casa e parar de pagar a faculdade, comecei lento o terceiro per√≠odo por conta de uma cirurgia no come√ßo do ano (1 semana parado) e minha av√≥ com c√¢ncer. 

O √°pice de toda merda foi em mar√ßo, quando tive dengue e internei com taxas baix√≠ssimas. 35k de plaqueta foi meu menor valor, quase evoluiu para dengue hemorr√°gica. Minha estadia no hospital foi muito merda, fiquei 1 semana de soro na m√£o, sem poder digitar ou usar o celular sozinho, fazendo exame de sangue todo dia (odeio agulha) e ainda por cima tomei rem√©dio que tive alergia.
Quando eu sa√≠, passei as pr√≥ximas 2 semanas ainda muito mal, fiz hepatite viral (nunca bebi na minha vida e nem pretendia, agora nem posso mais) e fiquei ultra atrasado na faculdade, e isso minha rela√ß√£o com a dita garota estando conturbada, pois ela dizia que me amava, peguei dengue e ela voltou namorando, mas dizendo que ia terminar para ficar comigo.

Eu cheguei a um ponto que n√£o consigo mais estudar, s√≥ procrastinar. Eu n√£o jogo mais, s√≥ quero passar o tempo e fa√ßo isso com LoL ou qualquer coisa que n√£o puxe energia.
Esse per√≠odo eu queria fazer diferente, mas chegou a um ponto que eu sentava para estudar e:
- n√£o conseguia come√ßar, sair do YT ou dos joguinhos
- n√£o conseguia ficar 5min sem querer pegar o celular ou um jogo
- come√ßava e dormia, at√© de noite, perdia 5-6h do meu dia
- quando e se eu estudava, ficava pensando que estudei errado e lembrava de biologia, apagava tudo e come√ßava do 0 de novo.

Eu quero estudar, n√£o aguento mais essa agonia. Eu durmo cedo, 22h, acordo 6h e tomo caf√©, super coffee, mas mesmo assim acabo no mesmo ciclo. Cilco esse ruim j√° que eu n√£o jogo o que quero, nem assisto o que quero, deixo tudo para quando eu ""estiver de f√©rias"". Passo 3h no lol que eu poderia descansar jogando Nier automata ou vendo meus animes, mas fico s√≥ querendo passar o tempo.


Eu descobri esse ano tamb√©m que tenho TEA, algo novo para mim. Fa√ßo uso de antidepressivos desde junho mais ou menos, mas meu psiquiatra j√° viu que eles n√£o surtiram efeito e me recomendou trocar para semana que vem.

Eu quero estudar quando tenho que estudar e saber descansar quando eu puder descansar. Quero fazer exerc√≠cios e n√£o quero mais essa tormenta do sono e cansa√ßo.

1h4u7zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1h4u7zs/trip_report_112529/,Trip Report 11/25-29,"Repost from the uktravel reddit page. Took a trip this past week and wanted to put my thoughts into text. Please feel free to ask any questions. 

Nov 25: Arrival

-As an American, entry process was as easy as scanning passport and having your picture taken without talking to any human. Customs you just walked under the green sign and no one said anything about anything to you. Not even any random checks. 

-Contactless payment worked fine with Google pay and a capital one venture card with no prior bank notification required. 99.9% of places we went preferred contactless, even food vendors. Had no problems using contactless for the tube on my phone. 

-used Maya eSim that we got set up before arrival, and it worked right on touchdown. Very easy to set up and use with great connection wherever we went since it would switch to whatever network was strongest, would highly recommend. 

-St. Giles Hotel London let us drop off our bags early at concierge before check in. Once we did check in at 2, we go to our (I'm assuming) refurbished room. For the purpose of our trip it was ""fine"" because the AC unit worked but the room was quite small and the ground was very dirty. We assumed it was because of only checking in that day but housekeeping never cleaned the floors at any time and at one point left a dirty rag on my suitcase. Noise level was moderate to high on the 6th floor, the window let in some fresh air but only partially opened. Hotel was VERY close to a large amount of food options and within eyesight of Tottenham Court Rd tube station so no complaints there.
 
-I appreciate that the sticker price is what your pay at the register. As an American, calculating tax before trying to buy something is frustrating. 

-Tunnel area across the bridge with a view of big ben had a long line at 9 AM on a random Monday (thanks influencers)

-Poppies fish and chips has the best tartar sauce we have ever had. Fish and chips were really solid too (had haddock)

-Busses were slower than walking around Soho in the afternoon so just walk

-Trafalgar square sausage stand on the right (facing the museum) had not-great bratwurst so maybe consider eating something else. Tasted more like American breakfast sausage than bratwurst. The middle drink stand had okay mulled wine and great mulled cider. Not a lot of seating in the middle market area so we just sat to the side on some steps and were fine.

Nov 26: WB Harry Potter Studio Tour Day

-Not new information, but book tickets way in advance. Took Tottenham Court to Euston via the tube. 

-Exited Euston underground and hooked around left to go to overground area. Big signs showing times. Staff there to help. Look for TIMES next to watford junction on listing's. There was a board that said ""next to watford junction"" but there was a train that arrived WAY before the time listed on that board from another platform. If we would have gone with the train on the ""next arriving"" board, we would have arrived 30 minutes later than the other train. 

-bought advance overground tickets from west midlands railway website since they offer lower prices on advanced bookings and the ones we got were valid on any train that whole day with no time restrictions, which helped a lot. These are not required and you are able to just tap in with contactless the exact same way as the tube if that is easier for you. 

-First Harry Potter bus left at 9:18 and loaded about 9:13. We just showed our studio tickets and that was it. Arrived 9:30. Entered 9:48 even though our tickets were for 10 am tour time. 

-No restrooms at the exit of Watford Junction, so be prepared. 

-had the ""Our Best Ever Sausage"" from Upper Crust, which is just 3 cut-up sausages on a plain baguette, but it was still okay. Mild enough for our upset stomachs. The Honeycomb Hazlenut Latte was very good, too. There were one or two other small options outside of the exit gates, but with how upset our stomachs were, this was a ""safe"" option and is something you could get for picky eaters. 

-There is a short video and music on busride to studio to set the mood

-Coat room is free at the information desk, but there is a line. 99% of tour is indoors, so coats are not necessary. 

-Free passport guides were given to us at the entry hall by a wandering staff member. The stamps for the passport aren't the ink kind but indentations on the page. There are also golden snitches hidden around the tour with hints listed in the guide. They can be quite hard to find, but staff are always willing to give some hints. There is a fairly massive selection of merchandise in all forms, some exclusive to the tour, such as the platform 9 3/4 shop with labeled merchandise sold exclusively at the shop halfway through the tour. Highly recommend visiting. 

-Left on 1:30 shuttle. Departed from same area as arrival but slightly different spot to queue up. They didn't check our tickets on the way back. 

-Only rushed area is the banquet room after the short film. Everything else was self paced, and you could be as quick as 45 minutes or many many hours if you read and watch everything. 

-Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the behind the scenes so be sure to hear them all out! 

-School group (school names were not on jackets) was there, and if your institution was there 11/26, you should be embarrassed at how those kids acted. Staff had to play teacher for the largely absent adults by telling them not to run, yell, or wander off without the group. Teachers could not care less and just shrugged when students were sprinting around.
 
-Went to Kings Cross and Platform 9 3/4 after. A lot of the merchandise is the same minus some black and gold ""Harry Potter - London"" merch which looked quite cool. There is the exact same photo op for the platform in the tour, so there no need to go to both places.
 
-Had the popcorn chicken at Good Friend Chicken in Chinatown for dinner. Some of the best chicken we have ever had even without the seasoning flavors they offer. This was a huge highlight for our trip. 

Nov 27: Food

-Went to the Host Cafe. Beautiful and relaxing place to have coffee and a small breakfast. Would go again. 

-Popped by the Fortnum and Mason shop at The Royal Exchange thinking it would be more like an American mall (thanks for social media framing and selective YouTube shots), but it was just two or three luxury shops and some restraunts upstairs. Pretty photo spot but not a necessity on any trip. 

-visited Leadenhall Market. It's neat for the photo opp, but we did not eat or shop here. 

-visited The Ginger Pig, Humble Crumble, and The Cider House at Borough Market. The sausage roll from Ginger Pig was 90% sausage 10% crust. It was good, but if you don't like onions, skip this. Humble Crumble was good. May have been the weather, but the berry filling was only warm when I went to eat it.  The cider house had a mulled cider that was good but pretty strong. 

-There is a seated step area right next to The Black Pig and Humble Crumble but can get crowded very quickly, and there's a ton of birds/bird poop there too, so beware. Maybe bring something to sit on here?

-In the evening, we went to Mercato Mayfair. Absolutely beautiful place with tons of great food options. We ate at the Beast & Field Steak booth and loved it. The Bavette was cooked great and seasoned very well. The chips we had with it were crispy and fresh. Would easily recommend this place as a must visit. 

Nov 28: British Museum and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland

-Go to the back side of the museum if you do not have a ticket and queue early. We queued 20 minutes before open, and there were 4 people in front of us. 10 minutes before open, and there were easily 50 people behind us. At opening at 10 am, there was a massive line. You walk through bag check, and you are in no problem. If you dont have a bag, they say just walk through. For history buffs, the British Museum is a must do with massive exhibits and a days worth of reading if you read all of the displays. There are interactive things to do for kids too, so I highly recommend it. Had no idea how absolutely massive this place is. 

-At 11:30 am, the pub across the street, the Museum Pub, had very few people and the server was very nice. We had tea and a steak and ale pie. Both were delicious, the pie crust was very flaky and the steak was very tender. 

-Went later that afternoon to the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Hyde Park station ""felt"" the closest to the blue and green entrances but there are tons of signs any which way you go. 

-I'm glad the entrance fee when we went was free because the prices of everything there were exorbitant and inconsistent. There would be a main alley booth for Cadbury hot chocolate for ¬£5 and tucked away in a corner of a seating area right next to it would be the same hot chocolate for ¬£3.20. Same for most hot drinks and even some foods. Saw some bratwurst for ¬£11 then across the park, it was ¬£8. Rides were all state-fair/carnival level and easily skippable for anyone who has been to a real theme park. Would easily skip this next trip in favor of some great light displays along the streets and shopping centers. 

Nov 29:

Woke up at 4 AM to find Elizabeth line down, according to the Tfl Go App. Luckily, we purchased the Heathrow Express tickets the night before for ¬£20 each since the Elizabeth line was down earlier in the week, and we were paranoid. Took early bus to Sussex Gardens, then walked (we missed the connecting bus) to Paddington Station. Got there at 5:06. The turnstiles to get in were all red, so we walked to the open gate on the far left side? There was a worker there and didn't say to do otherwise. Walked on the train at 5:08 and the train departed at 5:10 even though it was listed as 5:15. Arrived at 5:29. Weirdly, our QR code tickets worked just fine for scanning out even though we never got to scan in. 

-Walk to get to security from the station took 17 minutes (walking at a reasonable pace) in case anyone is curious about the timing of those sorts of things. 

-Heathrow airport security was pretty quick, and you DO have to remove your liquids from your bag, which is good to know since every airport is different these days. 

-Terminal 3 didn't list our gate until about an hour before boarding, I suppose to keep people in the central area with all the shops and food. You have to walk through a small mall to even get to that area. Small hack to get your gate earlier than the board is just look up your flight in a Google search, and it lists the correct gate several minutes before it pops on the board.

Recently, we slept together and it took him 4-5 hours to reply to my text after that. I mean he has always been like this from the start, however I wanted a , ""how are you feeling"" message after being intimate with each other or just like a 5 mins call instead of going missing, And he goes online and leaves without replying to my message, and I am pretty sure he is not busy since he was on vacation and acted the same. Yesterday, after not replying to me for 7 hours, he asked me out on a movie theatre date, and I said yes. Now today, I asked him maybe we can grab a coffee before that and he left me on seen for 2 hours. I don't understand, I am not even a pushy person, I respect him and never text 2 times in a row.

Just wanted to post a message detailing my experience so far with the info I would have found helpful when deciding to quit/quitting. Hopefully this will be useful to some of you.

**Context**

* 35 years old. Male. United Kingdom.
* Smoked for 16 years
* Averaged about 7-10 cigarettes a day for the most part, but would smoke more if out for a drink.
* Lead an otherwise relatively healthy life style ‚Äì average diet, exercise 3 times a week, average weight etc.

**Affects of Smoking/Reasons to Quit**

* **Appearance** ‚Äì I had started to notice how grey/sallow my appearance was getting over the last couple of years, and it was beginning to bother me more and more. I was noticing more wrinkles, my eyes were beginning to look sunken, loss of fat in my cheeks, and generally my complexion wasn‚Äôt great.
* **Teeth** ‚Äì Although my teeth generally look ok, smoking has lead to receding gums and some gum disease.
* **Circulation** ‚Äì I had begun to notice poor circulation, particularly in my hands. This meant my hands would generally go numb/tingly which I would notice when lying in bed reading or holding my phone. Also, it was having an effect on my erections, maybe only achieving 80% potency in that area for the last few years.
* **Exercise** ‚Äì I play football 2 or 3 times a week and noticed I couldn‚Äôt sustain any extended periods of intensity without losing my breath completely. Also couldn‚Äôt swim front stroke at any speed or for any length of time due to shortness of breath.
* **Long-Term/Old Age** ‚Äì The current/immediate effects of smoking were my main drivers to quit. However, ¬†I was beginning to think more and more about the future and what that would be like if I continued to smoke. Based on what I have read, there is about 50% chance that smoking would kill me, and I would likely die an average of 10 years earlier than I would otherwise. If it didn‚Äôt kill me early then it would likely make me seriously ill anyway and greatly impair my health and well-being in my older age. Basically, by the time I got to a point that I may be able to enjoy my retirement I‚Äôd almost certainly be dead or seriously ill.

**Quit Method**

* I had been thinking about quitting for about 6 months or so and managed to reduce my cigarettes to 5 a day for about 4 months. However, reverted back to normal smoking habits after a holiday.
* I had planned to use Nicotine Patches and had bought Allen Carr‚Äôs book in preparation to quit in November. However, after smoking too many on a night out, and catching a cold at the same time, I decided to quit cold turkey when hungover as I was already feeling rough and had less desire to smoke anyway.
* I didn‚Äôt read Allen Carr‚Äôs book in the end, though I have a good idea of what it includes based on posts in this sub.
* For support, I used the following apps ‚Äì Reddit (read lots and lots of posts on this sub, some really helpful). Also NHS Quit Smoking App, Smoke Free, Quit Tracker - these apps have various ways of tracking your progress, and the various health and financial benefits you achieve over time.

**Symptoms/Withdrawals**

* **Initial Withdrawals** \- As mentioned before, I had a cold/sore throat when I quit so I already didn‚Äôt feel well and I believe that this helped me bypass or overlook the worst of withdrawals for the first few days, so I cannot comment too much on this. I believe my experience was kind of skewed and wasn‚Äôt as bad as it may have been if I had been feeling well.
* **Smokers Flu** ‚Äì I went on to develop a chesty cough and my cold went on to last a couple of weeks in total - there were some headaches and runny nose/congestion etc. I believe some of this was what might be referred to as Smokers Flu, but I had already been ill anyway so I am not entirely sure.
* **Cravings** \- ¬†Physical cravings generally weren‚Äôt too bad and I can only really remember a handful of intense physical cravings during the first week. In the most part the worst cravings are mental and based on routine/habit. I believe I was also able to avoid the worst of this too as I was on leave from work for the first 2 weeks of quitting and was visiting family abroad ‚Äì the fact that I wasn‚Äôt going about my normal daily/work routine made it easier to not be triggered with cravings. In general, over the course of the last 7 weeks, I think it has gotten easier each day and the cravings basically disappeared after 4 weeks.
* **Sleep** ‚Äì my sleep was a bit disrupted for maybe the first 3 weeks or so. Falling asleep was fine but I would find that I would often wake up during the night, or early in the morning and find it difficult to fall back asleep. However, I am back to sleeping normally again now.
* **Mood** ‚Äì I did experience some short tempers and general frustration, but this would not last long and have steadily decreased and stopped entirely after 3 or 4 weeks.
* **Weight** ‚Äì I so far haven‚Äôt experienced any weight gain but I gave vigilantly tried to make sure that I did not increase any snacking and tried to keep my diet the same. I have also began drinking more water and reduced fizzy drinks to almost none as I also used to drink too much of these. I believe this may have helped to keep weight off, and even reduce slightly.

**Benefits**

* **Appearance** ‚Äì my complexion has improved greatly and my face/skin just looks healthier in general. I began to notice the effects within the first couple of weeks and has continued to improve since then. Wrinkles under the eyes appear to have reduced, my eyes look less sunken, and I no longer look grey/ill. Hoping this will continue to improve over the coming weeks and months too.
* **Teeth** ‚Äì my gums have started to return to a healthier colour and I expect this to continue to improve over the next few weeks.
* **Circulation** ‚Äì My circulation began to improve gradually over the last 7 weeks, and although I still get some numbness/tingling in my hands it has reduced loads and is still steadily reducing. I expect it to have gone completely in the next couple of weeks.
* **Erections** ‚Äì have now returned to 100% potency in the last week or so. Almost worth quitting for this alone!
* **Money** ‚Äì Roughly saving around ¬£185/¬£200 a month on cigarettes. Over ¬£2,000 a year. Hadn‚Äôt really considered this before as had just got used to the expense, but it is definitely a huge bonus. I‚Äôm currently thinking I might use the money to treat me and my partner each month ‚Äì maybe a massage or a nice meal out etc.
* **Energy/Exercise** ‚Äì I have noticed a general increase in physical energy and willingness to be active/pro-active. I am running more during football and generally walking more and being more active.
* **Mood/Mental Health** ‚Äì I feel like my mood and mental health has also improved. These were generally fine whilst smoking too, but I now feel a new kind of confidence and peace of mind now that I have quit. The odd tendency to overthink or experience of intrusive thoughts have pretty much gone and I generally feel healthier and happier.
* **Hangovers** ‚Äì I don‚Äôt drink too often, maybe a night at the pub once a month or so. However, hangovers are a 1000 times more manageable now that I don‚Äôt smoke heavily on a night out.
* **Taste/Smell** ‚Äì these have improved. Certain smells and tastes have become more pronounced and enjoyable, but overall I must admit it has not been a drastic change for me.
* **Freedom** ‚Äì the ability to enjoy things and experience things without having to think plan/think around cigarettes. I also used to think it would be really difficult to enjoy a coffee or a beer without a cigarette but you can actually learn to enjoy these things themselves and they are just as good, if not better without smoking.
* **General Health** ‚Äì I have been wearing a Fitbit for the last few years and this has highlighted the improvements to my health already ‚Äì Heart Rate has reduced, Heart Rate Variability has increased, Breathing Rate whilst sleeping has decreased, Oxygen Saturation has increased.

I‚Äôm sure there are still a lot more benefits to come, and some I may have forgotten to mention, but I hope this info has been helpful to some of you.

Quitting is definitely worth it, and honestly gets easier with each day.

It's now died again with electrical issues and steam failure, which seems to be a known problem. I'm in Australia so under our consumer laws I can push for warranty but it's either going to be a fight with Breville or pay a few hundred to have it fixed externally and I don't think I could be bothered given the quality issues I've already had. 

So my delightful but non-coffee drinking wife has surprisingly suggested getting a new machine and something decent.

Location as I mentioned is Australia.

Budget is preferably around $2500AUD, but could go up to $3500 if it's something special or otherwise worth it.

I drink double/triple/quad shot lattes/cortados, double machiattos and the occasional espresso shot, so steaming is a must.

The other primary requirement is a short heat-up time so I can make coffee while my little gremlin has breakfast. I usually make 3ish coffees a day.

I will occasionally make 3-4 coffees in a row for visitors  but this ability is not essential.

I have a Compak E10 grinder and am fairly proficient in dialing in grind size etc. I can use a commercial machine under duress but not a barista. I have limited interest in experimenting with temps, pressure etc although the ability to do this in the future would be nice.

Counter space is not really an issue although the BDB was a nice size.

I have been considering:
- Acaso Steel Duo PID and Duo Plus - currently my top contenders based on features and the idea of the thermoblock.
- Rocket Appartamento - my favourite looking one by far and probably second from top choice
- Bellezza Bellona - I quite like the idea of the external tank
- Lelit Mara X and Bianca - Mara X has some reviews suggesting the heat up time is quite long?
- Profitec Pro - I see these recommended a fair bit but can't really decide which model I should be looking out for.

A small and slightly dumb part of my monkey brain also says toss all these and get a La Pavoni lever because I've always loved the look of them.. so feel free to talk me into/out of that as well.

Thankyou all in advance!

There‚Äôs a coffee shop that I stop by occasionally on my way to work, not often but enough to have familiarized myself with the baristas.  

So this past week I decided to stop by and after ordering at the speaker I pulled up to the window and not even exaggerating but standing there was the most stunning Somali girl I‚Äôd ever seen, she was smiling before I even approached the window and I was just in awe.

Honestly wouldn‚Äôt be writing any of this if I didn‚Äôt think she wasn‚Äôt interested in me too. I can usually tell when a girl is either being polite or flirting but with her the flirting was more nonverbal, her eyes just seemed to draw me in.

Had a dream about you. Nothing serious. 

You had texted me out of the blue after all these years. Simply asking if we could just talk and be open and honest with each other. I reacted in the dream exactly the same as I would have in real life. Shock, mixed with confusion, with an equal amount of joy sprinkled in. I agreed and asked you to meet me at my favorite place. 

We met and took a long walk through Victoria Park, chatting about how we've been doing during all this time apart. We also chatted quite a bit about Dragon Age Vielguard, and we took in the sights of the Christmas lights set up against the backdrop of the fresh snow that had fallen.  We went back to my place where I made myself a cafe mocha, and you a tea since you're not a coffee drinker. We sat next to each other on the couch, you put your legs across mine, and we turned on rings of power, and just enjoyed eachothers company while sipping our warm beverages wrapped in a warm blanket. 

That's it, that's the dream. 

If this was real... when I woke up, I would have texted you expressing my gratitude to you for being a part of my life. 

Instead, I just stared at the ceiling and let out a loud sigh.

Oh, well.

The initial excitement then turned into an absolute nightmare. 

  
Arriving at exactly 10am (we were told to arrive between 9am and 12pm), we had to sit on the stairs as our accommodation wasn't ready, they wouldn't even let us into the common rooms to sit and we couldn't even go outside as we had already handed in our code of conduct. More and more people arrived and we piled on top of each other until 3pm when we went to the school where we were supposed to work the next day. After 6 long and boring hours of team building and meeting my committee, we went back to our dorm to finally get some sleep, change into formal clothes and go to the opening ceremony. We were supposed to be done by 6:45 so we could go to another building to attend the ceremony (we literally entered the building at 6:37 and only had 8 minutes to change), but because the building was so big we had to search for the room like in a labyrinth. The best part? After all this we only got a cold ""I'm very unhappy with your behaviour, you were supposed to be here at 6:45"" from one of the organisers, to which a frustrated and angry crowd shouted phrases like ""Get real"" and ""Try getting changed that quickly yourself"". 

After all this mess, the ceremony was fine and the Eurovillage dinner was really great.

In the morning we had a breakfast provided by the accommodation, which was fine, but as soon as we got out of the building it started to rain. In all this chaos we were yelled at to fill the gaps (""gigantic"" one metre gaps) between people moving. We then went to work, which was fine. There were zero to no breaks though, except for coffee breaks (where no-one had a reusable cup for coffee). I know the work had to be done, but damn was it hard. After we'd written the proposal (I was AFET personally, topic: Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine) and sent it to our chairperson to write an introduction for it, we went to the party. It was just bad, so we went to the dorms as soon as possible.   
  
The third day was just painful. The incredible inability of people to ask AND answer questions was just horrifying. Honestly said, if this is the future of the European Union, we are going to rot from the inside. Someone said that promoting democracy was just agitation and propaganda and guess what? Their proposal was accepted. We said that Ukrainian and Palestinian children shouldn't be bombed? Proposal rejected. This is obviously not a criticism of the EYP but a call for help as I think there were almost no sceptical thinking people. The highlight of it all was when our chairman started crying out of frustration as he said he had never seen such a stupid debate before. 

After all this, my friends and I would personally give EYP ƒåesk√° T≈ôebov√° 2024 an unbelievable rating of never again out of 10. The constant criticism made me feel like an absolute idiot and if it wasn't for the funny Ukrainians, I would collapse. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Or was it just the messy organisation of our event? ",3,1733142653.0,EYP,2,1.0,False

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I‚Äôm never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

If you think you‚Äôd like to chat with me and see how things go, don‚Äôt be scared to send me a dm!

I prefer to chat over on Telegram but we can hang here if we need to üòä

1h4tur6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocionicsTypeMe/comments/1h4tur6/type_me_its_long_and_its_hard_you_can_leave_a/,Type Me - It's Long And It's Hard (you can leave a joke in the comments),"\*\*1. How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?\*\*

\- Intermittently. Sometimes I'm really on. Sometimes really off. But I always have the energy to give anywhere between 1hr-2hrs a day at least. The rest is tough for me at times, because I guess, I lack willpower to do it or something? I get exhausted.

\- People go to work because they have to. The world runs on sustained value creation, and we're all part of it, contributing to it together. Without a farmer getting something of equal value from somewhere else, there wouldn't be food distributed around. We're all just creating value for each other. Work is the way humanity contributes to each other's lives.

\- The only real parameters IMO are physical/mental/emotional energy, how capable you are at something (which is also subject to improve) and desire. All else is vague conversation.

\*\*2. How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?\*\*

\- The quality of work must satisfy the basic criteria of being fit for the job. Since clearly, we need a defined purpose before we do something we call ""work.""

\- The quality of a purchase to me is about it fitting what I need the purchase for, its long term use to me, its sustainability in how well it proves itself over time again and again, and whether it stands the test of time in being durable and excellent in its function. Copy paste that to everything.

\*\*3. There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?\*\*

\- Elements like passion, dedication, willingness to constantly educate.

\- Skill comes down to many, many factors. Track records are important. But what I truly look at is an innate drive towards excellence. Does the other person have ""the edge."" The burning desire to excel, and become truly exceptional at something. Without that, you can have someone who works well but they'll never be a rockstar.

\*\*4. If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?\*\*

\- I break the problem down into its components.

\- Am I capable? if so, is it an emotional problem? If not, is it something I need education for? If not, do I need to just give it time? There's no such thing as an unsolvable problem, only lack of competence and time.

\- I can only tell if my performance is better or worse than others when I compare it. The second marker is public evaluation, however this is subject to the times we live in. Van Gogh died unrecognized.

\- For my own personal satisfaction, I go for three markers: 1) Was I deliberate in doing my best and kept improving on my best? 2) Was I honing in ONLY on the main goal, without letting any other motivations side track me? 3) Did I study everything that came before and improve on it - or created something entirely new?

If these criteria are met, I know I've done an excellent job.

\*\*5. How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?\*\*

\- You get what you want. Plain and simple.

\-  I've described the standards above.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

Seems fairly straight forward to me.

\---

\##Section 2

\*\*1. What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?\*\*

A whole is anything with a specific attribute that separates it from the rest.

You can identify its parts if it is divisible.

The parts are not equivalent to the whole, but there is often the fractal nature of things leaving their trace.

Technically, an ocean is a huge water body, but when all of those drops of water come together they create magnificent movements geographically.

A drop is a drop, but it can still teach you much about the nature of the ocean.

There's the fractal nature of life, you can spot the patterns everywhere.

\*\*2. What does ""logical"" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?\*\*

\- To me logical is about standing on solid ground with what you've found as the truth for yourself.

\- And then going a step further and arguing with your own perspective to find different ways you could be wrong.

\- And then still keeping an open mind to possibly being wrong, having the meta-awareness to see that life is formed up of infinite varied factors, which if you don't factor into your calculations, you're already wrong by default.

\- For this reason, I believe you can't find the truth. There is no such thing. At any given point of time, the access to information is the factor that keeps us from having a full picture of reality. Our job is to get the best information we have access to, make our best conclusions, and the possibility to being utterly and horribly wrong anyway.

I'm not sure if this correlates with the common view. Most people are dumb and terrible at thinking.

I'm being logical if I've taken in the MOST amount of information possible, created conclusions, proved them to myself as many times as possible, and still believe they're falsifiable.

\*\*3. What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.\*\*

A hierarchy is a system of power.

Military. Politics. Even Hollywood.

You don't necessarily have to follow it. A hierarchy is a system of values, therefore it's upto you to adhere to it or not.

Following it has advantages. You get to learn, and advance up it, and avail new advantages based on the value system of the said hierarchy.

I personally think hierarchies are for the unconscious. But I understand them, respect them, and follow them where they align with my goals.

Heck, being logical itself is hierarchical in nature. The best conclusion wins. All the other conclusions merely serve as a means to the end, for you to falsify against the strongest.

Evolution doesn't leave even the mind of man from participating in the survival of the fittest. We're merely living in the illusion that our minds are safe from hierarchy. It's everywhere.

\*\*4. What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.\*\*

Classification is the act of drawing boundaries around certain abstract or even physical entities so we can define them properly.

Classification helps you determine what you're dealing with, it's scope of definition and purpose, and where and how to use it.

A pen is a writing instrument. A paint brush is not.

But depending on where you use either, you can switch their purposes.

\*\*5. Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?\*\*

I don't deeply bother with other people's ideas being consistent.

Merely mine. And I try to make them as rock solid as possible.

I spot inconsistency in other's ideas via this indescribable hunch. It's simply that the conclusions they're coming to may have weak premises being disguised as solid ones.

Each person's understanding of the world is different, but some people let their logic be colored by that understanding to a fault.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

Seems straight forward. I did have to think through some parts. Especially the classification bit - mainly because I don't really know the definition of classification itself so well. So I had to google that. But otherwise, seems like questions that I could answer with some thinking involved.

\---

\##Section 3

\*\*1. Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?\*\*

I usually don't press people. Unless I have to or I get angry.

The methods I use can come off fairly crude or obnoxious. But if I do so, it's usually dependent on the more important question of ""do I need to?""

\*\*2. How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?\*\*

\- Analysis, plans, I get to work eventually. And I push myself, ridiculously hard to go towards what I want. I don't always get it, which is something I'm improving at. But my plans are impeccable.

\- I think that's a straightforward question. If you have to work to get what you want, you work to get what you want.

\- Unless again, I have issues in that department. For example, you can be hard working but believe you aren't worth the things you want.

\- My biggest weakness in this area is around the ability to get things done - something I've been resolving for a while now and should succeed at because I've figured out mental and emotional models to replace my default ones.

\*\*3. How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?\*\*

\- I usually like to logically reason.

\- If the opposition resorts to force, then I the path is clear and it's time to take up arms. I'm not scared of people. Only scared of what I can do if I get angry.

\- So, usually I try to logically and emotionally appeal to the other person's desires, interests and values. The value based manipulation of someone's psyche is something I've learned recently, thanks to realizing most people aren't good thinkers and you can't use that everywhere. It depends. I use the tool that gets the job done.

\*\*4. When do you think it's ok to occupy someone's space? Do you recognize it?\*\*

\- I like to give other's space and have adequate space for myself.

\- But again, I'm a tit for tat person, if I meet someone who's trying to occupy mine, I'll seek to crush them entirely and completely.

\- This has led to confrontations before. But I don't back out once I've decided someone is being unreasonable and also giving others a hard time.

\- But by my usual nature, I'm a very ""I'm going to get what I want, just don't get in my way"" kind of guy.

\*\*5. Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?\*\*

I think others do. I realize horribly the limits of my own will. And therefore, I'm constantly working to expand it.

Everything can be trained.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

I experienced feelings of anger/confrontation inside at some point. This isn't an area I feel deep ease in. It's something I'm getting better at, but in the meantime, I realize there's clearly emotional turbulence when I specifically come across people are trying to be bullies. I'm very much the kind of person who tries to bully or get inside the heads of people who bully others.

\---

\##Section 4

\*\*1. How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?\*\*

\- Through hot showers. I love drinking. Alcohol makes me feel unhibited and loose, and I really enjoy that. I love sex.

\- I'm deeply drawn to beautiful women. To beaches, mountains, to feeling the wind on my face when I ride a bike.

\- I love the feeling of touching others. I find comfort in listening to different parts of a song, hidden instruments that aren't so obvious.

\*\*2. How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?\*\*

\- ""Everything right where I need it"" is the definition of harmony for me. If this is about physical things, my room, etc.

\- When it comes to social situations, I define harmony as having a good time with others.

\- Building a harmonious environment is about contributing good feelings, even stories to others that people can relate to. Giving others a good time while being true to myself is my way of creating harmony. If it's disturbed, I usually excuse myself from the company if I know for a fact that I do not like the other person, in case I do like them, I try to resolve the situation with them trying to understand their point of view, their feelings, and finding a common negotiation ground where both of us can be happy.

\*\*3. What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?\*\*

\- Sleep. Relaxing. Watching TV. Being away from people every once in a while.

\- Comfort to me is about introspection. Journalling. Even lying down in bed doing nothing. Watching movies that make me understand more about this world. Or just watching movies that make me feel something deep.

\*\*4. How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?\*\*

\- I'm not sure how to answer this. I enjoy my hobbies. I try to be competitive and good at all that I do.

\*\*5. Tell us how you'd design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?\*\*

I prefer to do this myself. Lots of small lights. Good smells. Minimalistic room, with a big mirror, a very comfortable bed. Soothing lights, warm, higher temperature lights. Lots of books.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

Seemed like I'm answering what my preferences are. Easy enough.

\---

\##Section 5

\*\*1. Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.\*\*

\- I usually don't do this unless it creates a positive environment.

\- I don't take up space talking about negative things from my life.

\- To me inappropriate is when someone is childishly taking up too much space, killing the vibe of the group without realizing they're doing it.

\- Another inappropriate use of emotions for me, is when a person does it solely to gratify their desire to be in the center. Such people, I usually fuck with.

\*\*2. How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?\*\*

\- As honestly as possible. I'm not sure how my emotions affect others. I merely know that I try my best to say what's true to me. I do read other people's faces to determine what they feel and adjust what I should tell them accordingly, since I don't like to talk about myself with those who would rather not listen.

\*\*3. Are you able to change your demeanor in order to interact with your environment in a more or less suitable way? How do you determine what is suitable?\*\*

\- I would say so.

\- Suitable, in my opinion, is whatever adds to the enjoyment of the environment around me.

\*\*4. In what situations do you feel others' feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?\*\*

\- When others are sad, it hits me rather easily. Or extremely joyful.

\- When I want to improve the moods of others, I try to tell them what they wish to hear. Or sometimes I go into my own life stories. Sometimes, I'll just listen.

\*\*5. How do others' emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?\*\*

\- I'm usually deeply unaffected by what others feel. It's either that or I'm still unaware of it? It's possible.

\- Usually, I express what I feel clearly. Though, I usually cut out the emotions I feel internally while I express them outwardly, because it's likely I'm ashamed internally of being found out as someone who is weak, or can't handle his own emotional stuff.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

Insightful. I learned things about myself.

\---

\##Section 6

\*\*1. How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?\*\*

This depends deeply on what someone shares with me. It also depends on how clearly they're speaking their mind, and how controlled their expressions or their energy are.

\- I think I can usually affect this by putting others at ease by being non-judgmental. However, I try not to since usually the people I like open right up, and those I don't, are the ones I have to ""try"" with and I'd rather not.

\*\*2. How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?\*\*

\- How much I like someone is deeply affected by how much I feel safe about being myself around them. Speaking about things that I'm uncomfortable talking about.

\- I also think it's very important to me for the other person to see me as emotional, but capable. I usually need encouragement more than I do solutions.

\- I think this affects my relationships by making me usually emotionally muted. My emotions aren't up for discussion. And also, I think there's immaturity behind how I take the blows when directed towards my emotional ""body."" At least, that's what I think is true for now about this area.

\*\*3. How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?\*\*

\- In close relationships, a sense of ""togetherness"" develops. It's rather easy for me to create, except, I don't like to do it artificially. Even though if I put my mind to it, I'd do it fairly well.

\- The distinguishing characteristic of a close relationship for me are respect during vulnerability, belief in each other, understanding, and empathy while giving each other suggestions.

\*\*4. How do you know that you are a moral person? Where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what's moral? Why?\*\*

\- I don't know that I'm moral. I merely try my best to be. I think morality is very, very subjective.

\- There are cannibalistic tribes in the world. And if killing a human is considered murder, then so shall all the slaughter that happens for us to eat animals, or even plants that feel pain.

\- I draw my sense of morality from a sense of rightness/goodness or bad/evil about the world. It seems primordial to me, this sense of being moral or amoral, but it works for me.

\- I don't think others have to share my beliefs on being moral, as long as it doesn't hurt who I am or what I want from this world.

\- And even in that last sentence, it shows how my morality is as subjective as any other person's. Morality in my opinion comes down to ""what hurts me"" vs ""what doesn't hurt me.""

\- And many of us expand our consciousness to other objects, humans, even nations, therefore feel hurt by their pain.

\- But I wouldn't necessarily call a person amoral for not choosing to do anything about the state of the world.

\- Overall, morality is confusing for me. I don't completely understand it. It baffles me, I know it exists, yet I think it doesn't and it's all an imaginary construct.

\*\*5. Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?\*\*

\- I can only know if I ask. All else are my thoughts and beliefs about it.

\- I prefer to ask. And I try to dig into the answers.

\- I also watch for behavior, tone of voice, how the other person is speaking about other people in their life, many other such factors.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

Again, made me think and dig into aspects of myself I usually don't like to visit.

\---

\##Section 7

\*\*1. How can you tell someone has the potential to be a successful person? What qualities make a successful person and why?\*\*

\- Their ability to gather information and act on it.

\*\*2. Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?\*\*

\- I like to DO things. Something that gets my body moving. Something that gets me out of my mind is awesome. Bonus points if it's fun.

\*\*3. How do you interpret the following statement: ""Ideas don't need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile."" Do you agree or disagree, and why?\*\*

\- This really depends.

\- If your idea is to fly an airplane without wings, I'm not sure why entertain it at all.

\- Yet, without us thinking about an airplane without wings, we might limit our conception of what's possible to only what we know.

\- In this regard, I like to keep my mind as wide open as possible.

\- I read astrology skeptically, and I learn science like it's magic. There's so much to this world that's undiscovered. It's our duty to keep our mind open, even in the face of wild inner skepticism.

\*\*4. Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?\*\*

\- A chicken swimming in science. How interesting, a nerdy chicken that's a harvard professor and perhaps likes to go for a swim in the afternoons, sips a couple of margeritas while learning about quantum physics.

\- I don't know. I know I drew this one, lol.

\*\*5. How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?\*\*

\- I'm tremendous at understanding systems, at implementing systems and being a very thorough thinker who goes to the bottom of the barrel.

\- My potential around being willful, action-oriented, and also my ability to let go of reason entirely, so I can dive into the world of emotions headfirst are qualities I'm working to develop.

\*\*Meta-analysis:\*\*

I liked this section. It felt like fun.

\---

\##Section 8

\*\*1. How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?\*\*

\- People change through direct work, emotional insight, philosophical insight, or through epiphanies.

\- Eventually whatever changes a person is very personal, and what we know from the external circumstances are merely the precursors.

\- There are way too many factors involved that change a person. Not to even describe the fleeting thought that might solidify into an intention. One day a person might be an artist, tomorrow, they may be a businessman, and it all starts with different intentions solidifying.

\- Eventually, change happens in the world of intentions. In the invisible realm of the thin line between the unconscious and the conscious minds, where thoughts exist in a state of limbo until something, and I'm not sure what this something is, jolts them awake, causes that intention to become a dominant intention in someone's mind, and makes them want to act on it.

\- Until this jolting happens, a 1000 events can happen that should've or could've caused a direct change but didn't.

\- Eventually it's the solidifying of an unconscioius intention coupled with desire and capability that bring change into a person's life.

\*\*2. How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?\*\*

Time is a flow of sense perceptions solidfying, disintegrating, assembling, becoming, falling apart. Time is for our mortal purposes linear, but it's right now, and it's forever.

From our mortal perspective, yes, time can be wasted. But time is never wasted. Because time is what gives birth to the self-identity that we call ourselves, and so all time does is merely convert our sentient consciousness into different identities, sections of which may awaken or go out at different times which we call life and death. Today I am this person, writing what I'm writing here.

Tomorrow, I'll be another person, forged with different memories to convince me I'm someone else. Time borrows its identity from the space it's currently in touch with, locally, but globally, time is eternity itself and free of all identity and sense perceptions.

\*\*3. Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?\*\*

There is. It's experience.

Experience is its own language. Words are meant to carry experiences, therefore, they're symbols. They're not the experience themselves. Words are packets of information that try to take another person's consciousness to the exact coordinates of your experience. But in doing so they're always doomed to fail and at best you can draw an intersection in two venn diagrams, but an overlap is extremely unlikely because each person's ""idea"" of what those words mean (experience) is going to be guided by their local identity (who I am right now in time) based on their past perceptions, and so, what they'll think about when you say something is entirely different from what you think about. It's beyond comparable.

We can understand it where language doesn't work by abandoning language.

I can tell you have a cup of coffee. Or I can give you a cup of coffee.

While the coffee I taste is going to still be dramatically different from the coffee you will taste, there will be massive overlaps because now we're looking at the source material (experience) to derive our symbols from.

Therefore, when two people drink coffee, they can both agree its nutty, or has a berry flavor, or other shit.

\*\*4. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?\*\*

I'm usually good at predicting far ahead in time fairly easily. But I don't try to anymore.

The unfoldment of events is merely about connected intents, or predictable essences of different events.

With humans, the essence is their intentions, with nature, the essence can be the different constants like gravity, vibrations. There's an essence to everything in the universe, if you open up your mind and study things closely, you'll see they all follow a pattern. History repeats itself in reassembled different forms.

The universe in the most macro level - cosmic assemblies of stars, and at the micro level - the human mind, is cyclical in the way it operates. So are humans, and the collective events that are formed up of humans coalescing together into combined intentions that form patterns.

I can tell where something is going to go by looking at where it's been, and where its mind (intent and direction) is. The only difference between me and others is I'm looking at 100s of factors to come to that decision, since intentions collide and eat each other up in the mind, leaving the most dominant ones alive. But you can still spot them.

This where my earlier answer about ""what solidifies an intent"" comes in. I'm always questioning, but I'm uncannily sure too. It's weird to describe.

\*\*5. In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?\*\*

Timing is always important.

But experience has taught me so is the will to act.

By biding your time, you can act at the right moment.

And by force of will, you can cause time to show up before it is its turn.

They're inseparable. After all, time is just entropy measured. And the will to act can modify entropy. ",1,1733142535.0,SocionicsTypeMe,0,1.0,False
1h4ttg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h4ttg9/my_journey_so_far_i_no_longer_feel_the_desire/,My journey so far: I no longer feel the desire. ,"I never thought in my life I would be able to stop drinking. Everyone in my family were alcoholics and I started drinking when I was 16. All my social events and friendships started with drinking and were fueled by getting drunk. I felt like if I wanted a good time, I HAD TO DRINK. I would make plans and exceptions to ensure I could. Didn‚Äôt matter if I was going to a bar or staying at home. 

For a combination of different reasons, I stopped drinking earlier this year. I don‚Äôt know the exact date, but it was around March or April. I wasn‚Äôt even trying too, I just forgot or didn‚Äôt have interest to drink. 

After a few months, I noticed how much better I felt. Physically and mentally. I was processing and handling things healthier. I realized I didn‚Äôt need alcohol to have a good time. I would replace those times with a diet soda or coffee. 

Throughout this journey, I did try alcohol a few times. First was a bottle of Soju sometime in July. I couldn‚Äôt even drink half and shortly got a raging headache afterwards. The following morning I had a hangover. 

Yesterday, I had half a beer. It was a strong beer. I was buzzed for about 5 minutes before a familiar raging headache came. 

It seems I‚Äôm having some physical responses from alcohol now. Maybe I always had them but pushed through to get to the ‚Äúdrunk fun‚Äù part. Either way, I think I‚Äôm done. I have no interest or desire to return to alcohol. All I can think about is the raging headache I get. 

I feel really good about that. I‚Äôm ending the nasty traditional that my family or friends carried, and I can move away from that poison. I just wanted to share my journey and experience. ",12,1733142407.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

1h4tqcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1h4tqcn/my_trusty_jansport_backpack_from_gym_to_office/,My Trusty JanSport Backpack: From Gym to Office,"So, I recently got the [JanSport Cool Backpack with a 15-inch laptop sleeve](https://amzn.to/3Vk81SO), and let me just say‚Äîit‚Äôs been a total game changer for my ‚Äúchaotic but functional‚Äù lifestyle.

Let me set the scene: I‚Äôm someone who tries to juggle gym sessions, work, and random coffee shop pit stops all in one day. (Spoiler: it‚Äôs messy.) I needed something that could carry my gym clothes, laptop, snacks (important), and still not scream, *‚ÄúHelp, I‚Äôm falling apart!‚Äù* Enter this JanSport backpack.

**The Gym Test**  
First, it‚Äôs surprisingly roomy. I can stuff in my sneakers, a change of clothes, and even a water bottle without doing the awkward *sit-on-it-to-zip-it-up* dance. Bonus: it has this nifty front pocket where I stash my deodorant and earbuds. Nothing worse than smelling like a foot when you‚Äôre trying to be productive post-gym, am I right?

**The Laptop Sleeve**  
Here‚Äôs where it shines: the padded 15-inch laptop sleeve. After the gym, I head straight to work, and my laptop feels super secure. I‚Äôve had backpacks before where I swear my laptop was one bump away from becoming a frisbee. Not this one. I‚Äôve even dropped it once (on accident, of course), and everything inside was fine.

**BTW I Got Mine For REALLLYYY Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3Vk81SO)

**Style and Comfort**  
Okay, real talk: I was worried it might look too ‚Äúhigh school‚Äù for an adult lugging it into an office. But nope, it‚Äôs sleek and subtle. Plus, the padded straps are a lifesaver when I‚Äôm carrying what feels like my entire life. (Seriously, why do I think I need *three* books in case I get bored?)

**Funny Moment Alert**  
Last week, I was rushing to the gym and stuffed a banana into the side pocket for a quick snack. Guess who forgot about it? This girl. Fast forward three days, and I found a very sad, very brown banana in perfect squish-free condition. If that‚Äôs not a testament to the durability of this backpack, I don‚Äôt know what is.

**TL;DR:** If you‚Äôre looking for a versatile, durable, and surprisingly stylish option for gym-to-everything-else life, the [JanSport Cool Backpack](https://amzn.to/3Vk81SO) delivers. Just don‚Äôt leave fruit in it too long unless you‚Äôre trying to start your own banana bread factory.

Anyone else use their backpack for gym stuff? Curious if mine‚Äôs the only one with a deodorant + banana combo! üçå",1,1733142115.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False

Like full blown phobia. I‚Äôd rather see a snake in my garden than a blue tongue lizard. Don‚Äôt ask me why because I have no idea I just always have been. I also don‚Äôt really like little drop tail lizards. They freak me out. Again I have no idea why but I‚Äôm not scared of spiders or snakes or anything like that. But lizards. Yes. 

Anyway! My question is how to deter lizards away from my backyard. I have a dog but he would usually spend the day inside or at work with me. There are little drop tails in my front garden too and they like to sit in my door step which I don‚Äôt like that. There is one that hangs out in a little hidey hole beneath the front step, sometimes he gives me a fright when I first notice him but I have slowly gotten used to him being there, but I want to be able to keep them away from my garden without hurting them. Like is there a certain scent that repels them, or can I put something in my garden that will keep them away? I don‚Äôt care about snails and bugs or whatever in my garden I just don‚Äôt want lizards. I‚Äôve never seen a blue tongue in my garden, but I have when I was out on a walk with my dog recently in someone‚Äôs front garden nearby where we will. I have read things like coffee grounds, onion, egg shells deter them but I think these were websites referring to little house lizards in other countries so I wasn‚Äôt sure if that still applies to blue tongues and drop tails?? 

Please anything will help! 
And no I will partake in exposure therapy I‚Äôd rather just be afraid lol
