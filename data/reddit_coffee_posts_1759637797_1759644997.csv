1nygmev,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1nygmev/i_still_set_the_table_for_three/,I Still Set the Table for Three,"

My wife, Anya, passed away two years ago. Pancreatic cancer. It was swift and brutal. Our morning ritual, for fifteen years, was simple: I'd make the coffee, she'd make the toast, and we'd sit at our small, round kitchen table, our knees touching, and plan our day.

The silence after she was gone was a physical presence. To fight it, I started a new ritual. Every morning, I still make two coffees and two pieces of toast. I set them on the table, one at my spot, one at hers. I talk to her empty chair. I tell her about the weird dream I had, about the neighbour's new dog, about how much I miss her. It‚Äôs mad, I know. But it‚Äôs the only thing that makes the room feel less empty.

Yesterday, my sister visited unannounced. She saw the two settings, the full cup of coffee growing cold across from me. Her face crumpled from pity to concern. ""John,"" she said softly, ""you have to stop this. She's not coming back.""

I just smiled a sad smile and said, ""I know. But what if, for just one moment, she is? I can't risk her finding an empty seat.""",1,1759644916.0,traumatizeThemBack,0,1.0,False

Hello! F21, just wanted to ask kung paano malaman if interested yung isang guy sayo? So there's this workmate of mine kasi na nacucutean din naman ako to begin with. There was a time where I was grabbing coffee and he was there too staring at me the entire time and suddenly approached me if from what school ako and department sa office (i'm one month palang sa office and I think he assumed na i'm fresh grad in which I am). It's our sole interaction palang so far. But recently nakita ko ule siya nakatitig sakin. 

I'm planning to step up the game a little next time by asking from what dept siya and ask about what he does sa dept niya :)

A shallow stream gurgled over rocks in the wooded depths of the park. He‚Äôd been walking along it for what felt like hours, studying its banks and picking up rocks that caught his eye.¬†*I should reach the meet-up point soon,*¬†he thought.

And sure enough the stream widened into a waist-deep river, the trees thinned and eventually opened to a clearing with tall grass and thorned bushes. Crickets shot across the grass blades at the tremors of his approaching footsteps and lightning bugs pulsed against the darkening sky.

At the mouth of the river a campsite was set up on the rocky banks. He sat in front of the crackling campfire, watching the cool lake surface as sparks floated into the sky before dying.

The sun left him, the heat dissipated with the horizon and coldness crept in. A mounting sense of discomfort built as the time of meeting passed and the landscape aged.

The water gently rolled toward his foot, and then back again before advancing further. He sat up and lifted his feet, but with a crash a wave swept underneath him, sizzling on the coals. He stood up, ankle deep in the water and backed away.

Undeterred, the tide rolled forward, encroaching on the camp. It penetrated the grass and logs and the tent began floating as it climbed up his calves and thighs.

He stumbled back up the bank, losing his footing in the loose soaked sand underneath but could not outpace the advancing waves. They climbed to his waist and up his chest as he began to float in them, desperately reaching for a tree or shrub to grab.

With a final scream, he was encompassed in the murk and swept away. He thrashed and spun randomly through it, brushing passing foliage and disrupted dirt clouds. After losing his bearings he sank further and slid along the ground, reaching for a handhold.

He finally righted himself and looked up through bleary eyes to search for the surface. He‚Äôd been pushed into the clearing, though he couldn‚Äôt see much through the opaque water.

It suddenly shook. Like the molecules themselves vibrated, drawing inward for a split second before restoring direction. A beat passed and again it shook, drawing forward into the darkness.

Reaching for a branch, he pulled himself closer to the focal point of the sound and froze with what he saw. Fastened in the dirt, through passing clouds of sand, were mighty pins, bolts bigger than his head.

The pins fastened massive chains that fell away into an abyss. As he floated closer, the endless pit widened, pitched, yawed as if wrestling itself from the ground. The water shook again, being drawn into it with a stronger force than before.

Gripping a root he steadied himself on the ground but the current pulled him in. He desperately scrambled for another handhold, kicking his feet before the root loosened and started pulling from the dirt.

The water shook again, weakening his grip as his feet dangled at the precipice. He looked back, his toes starting to dip over the edge, and closed his eyes in fear.

*Hiiiiiiii*¬†He awoke with a deep and sudden inhale. He was slick with sweat, burning hot in his comforter and relieved it was a dream. The blanket had tangled around his arms and legs forming a cocoon around him that was plastered to the ceiling. He had been floating in his sleep.

After a couple deep breaths, he focused inward on thoughts of weight, its balance and coordination. This was the only way he‚Äôd found to stop floating once it started, and as he did so the cocoon gently sank to the mattress.

Kicking a pile of laundry around, he picked up a clean looking towel and began drying himself off. He laid the comforter out flat on the ground and pulled the pillow cover off.

Collapsing on the couch, he kicked his feet onto the coffee table and leaned back. Soft moonlight bathed his legs and his heavy eyelids drew down, even though he knew he wouldn‚Äôt be allowed back to sleep. He thought back to his conversation earlier that day.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking of where you wanna go, You‚Äôre thinking of how to get there,‚Äù Thomas said, gesturing with his hands.

Corey gripped the oven and refrigerator door, slightly levitating off the ground.

‚ÄúCan you explain it another way?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just did,‚Äù he said, munching on a handful of trail mix.

Corey furrowed his brow, focusing, and loosened up a bit before beginning to drift upward.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already got floating down, just be patient.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long does this usually take? I gotta go to work tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, mostly a couple days, cause we merge when we‚Äôre kids and play around all the time‚Ä¶‚Äù

He chewed a bit and shrugged, ‚ÄúNo idea how it works with older people.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I guess that settles the Bene Elohim thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all that about - I don‚Äôt go to church y‚Äôknow,‚Äù Corey retorted, hanging from the oven.

‚ÄúI mean, long story short, angels have jobs, and that‚Äôs a pretty bougie one.‚Äù

‚ÄúA job from god huh,‚Äù Corey snorted.

‚ÄúIs that so crazy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo I mean,‚Äù he shrugged, ‚ÄúI guess the word¬†*job*¬†just seems funny...‚Äù

He changed the subject, ‚ÄúSo does this mean god¬†*is*¬†real?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a question‚Ä¶‚Äù Thomas hesitated, ‚ÄúThat might be better for the Deacons.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeaking of the Deacons, I‚Äôm not supposed to tell you this but‚Ä¶‚Äù

He thought for a moment then shrugged, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna find out anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell they got this summit coming up,‚Äù he rustled in the bag, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a meeting they have every year.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre¬†*supposed*¬†to be keeping the peace, but we mostly sit back and let everyone do it themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this again?‚Äù Corey asked.

‚ÄúYou know like angels, and you met some witches right? The Amoretti coven? Well them - and the polymorphs and statues.‚Äù

Corey looked back blankly, ‚ÄúSo these are all angels?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Corey, we‚Äôre angels. They‚Äôre humans. Most of their legacy is from Bene Elohim porking humans back in the day. Maybe something to ask your guardian about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYea I‚Äôll put it on the list.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway, the polymorphs are shapeshifters and statues are immortals. My words, not theirs.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you guys are like monster police?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore like the monster UN, we just stop by every year and do a couple votes.‚Äù

He leaned forward in his chair, ‚ÄúBut the last couple years they‚Äôve been getting rowdy.‚Äù

He shook his finger, ‚ÄúThis year, we‚Äôre going to use¬†*your*¬†testimony.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I allowed to say no?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo whatever. But we know the Ammoretis brained a warlock in Seaside and Phil kept it quiet to avoid the drama.‚Äù

Corey resisted the urge to react, controlling his expression.

‚ÄúAnd I hear through the grapevine they‚Äôve been watching you.‚Äù

He pursed his lips slightly.

‚ÄúIf you testify at the summit, we might be able to put the human lines in a bit of a time-out.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe not a big deal for the covens, but the statues are in big business, and they‚Äôre worried about their bottom line.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like I should keep it to myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll pick a side eventually, or they pick you - I mean why do you think I‚Äôm here?‚Äù

He stared back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt flatter yourself. If I know it, they know it. I‚Äôm keeping an eye on you for your own sake.‚Äù

Corey gently floated back down to the kitchen floor, letting go of the oven.

‚ÄúCan they fly too?‚Äù he asked sheepishly.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he paused, ‚ÄúBut neither can you.‚Äù

1nygdpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1nygdpy/mom_passed_away/,Mom passed away,"on Friday, Sept. 26. She was at our home on hospice. 


This post is a long read, but I chose to share it w a lot of detail, in case someone else one day finds themselves in a similar situation and is running on empty and searching the internet for someone‚Äôs experience they can relate to and maybe in which they can find some comfort or validation.


Mom was 77 and had diabetes for well over 2 decades, maybe even closer to 3, I‚Äôm not even sure. She didn‚Äôt prioritize controlling it other than w medication which then led to needing insulin on top of the oral meds.
Fifteen years ago she started slowly displaying signs of dementia. Then 10 years ago was the start of her intermittently being hospitalized for the next several years (falls, one fall while in hospital, covid complications, respiratory, was on ventilator, etc). Dad is 10 yrs older but in much better physical and mental health and is age-appropriate medically and generally overall (although he‚Äôs starting to show signs of dementia now as well).


They lived independently in a house my sister owned, but then came up on the waitlist for a senior low income apt complex and moved there about 11 years ago. Not long after that, mom‚Äôs dementia became so bad that she‚Äôd wander out into the parking lot in the middle of the night. My sisters and I decided they needed to be placed in an ALF stat. The one we chose took Medicare/medicaid and had a locked memory floor on which they allowed for mom and dad to room together. 


Dad hated it there from pretty much the start. He complained about the food, didn‚Äôt make any effort to meet folks from the other non-memory floors or lounges he had the freedom to visit. He eventually started printing out signs placed on their door ‚Äòletting‚Äô staff know at what times they were ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to enter their room. We were like lol/embarrassingly horrified/stressed they‚Äôd get booted. Sooo many calls from the director about how he got irate and raised his voice to staff. It was like when I‚Äôd get calls at work from the ymca after school program bc my kid wasn‚Äôt listening and they‚Äôd politely beg me to talk to him on the phone.


During and after mom‚Äôs hospitalizations she deteriorated physically and mentally more and more each time and eventually became disabled and unable to walk. She also became incontinent so staff had no choice but to enter their room frequently around the clock for diaper changes, distributing meds, meals, bathing, cleaning, laundry, etc. Thankfully the staff were very respectful, patient and kind. Now looking back, I‚Äôm sure it helped that they knew we, the daughters, were pissed about dad‚Äôs behavior and apologized constantly. My sisters sent coffee gift cards and snack baskets at every opportunity.


Eventually, the facility director left and that led to a mass staff exodus. Around that same time (late summer ‚Äò22), my husband and I had just bought and moved into a new home. Exactly one month after move in, dad called desperately asking if he and mom could live w us bc he just couldn‚Äôt take the facility/staff changes anymore. Fortunately for them, we had a first floor primary suite and after discussing, husband and I went to go relocate them from coast to coast (horrific experience btw on planes w a disabled, incontinent, demented elderly parent plus another just old and slow parent) and into our new home (and yes, into our new bedrm). 


I‚Äôm not going to sugar coat anything. It was a HARD adjustment and took some time to learn how to best meet their needs as we went. Solid period of trial and error. Our oldest adult son lives at home w us and became part of the ‚Äògrandparents care team‚Äô by default. It really changes the dynamics of your family, relationships, and your priorities. In all honesty, it may sound harsh, but it really disrupted our lives. 


I mean we knew it wouldn‚Äôt be a cakewalk, but we hadn‚Äôt thought about all the little changes. Simple things like going out for anything, now needed coordinating to make sure at least one of us 3 were home. Very rarely did all 3 of us go out together whether to dinner or to stores or sometimes had to bc of differing work schedules, but when we did, I could never be fully relaxed, just always in a hurry to get back home. 


We eventually got into a routine and figured out who gets which chores and caregiving responsibilities. Fast fwd to spring of last year, we had a family discussion and chose to put mom on hospice. Her conditions were never going to improve and only worsen so all the meds seemed futile. The doctors narrowed down her meds to a select few and being on hospice allowed all of us the peace of mind that a sudden medical event wouldn‚Äôt put her in a hospital or facility where she‚Äôd be w strangers, disoriented and afraid. She‚Äôd be able to remain at our home and for us to honor dad‚Äôs one wish, which was for them to physically be together as long as possible til the end. 


Well on that Friday, mom passed peacefully at home. A week prior she suffered a stroke. She remained responsive afterwards but had slurred speech, loss of movement on one side of body and no interest in eating or drinking. Nurses helped medicate her to avoid any pain or discomfort. Her decline progressed as gentle as possible for a hospice patient, based on nurses‚Äô observations and comments.


My sisters flew out a few days after while mom had nurses and other staff in and out of the house to evaluate her and guide us through the process and what to anticipate. I had prepared myself for a long while now and also read as much as I could to educate myself on how to best care for mom when this time came, so although it was sad, I was determined to remain focused on observing her vigilantly for any signs of pain or discomfort. I was delirious w fatigue but pushed through and verbally assuring mom constantly of our presence and how much we loved her. I didn‚Äôt have a healthy relationship w my mom growing up and it just never got any better into my adulthood. But I remained respectful and for the sake of our family as a whole, put on a happy face for her.


The mom from back then, though, was long gone and I chose to let my gut lead me in giving her grace, showing her compassion, tenderness, peace and love as she was fading fast. 
My sisters, though, felt that she should be eating and drinking more. Strokes, I learned, affect the swallow reflex/muscle. Mom could only take in a teaspoon of water at a time and if anyone tried to give her more than that, she‚Äôd have a coughing fit and that created a risk of choking and blocking her airway. Then there was my dad who was still contemplating if not taking her to the hospital was the best idea. 


There were a lot of questions to the nurses and conversations w in our family taking place. When I relayed the interventions that would happen if we hospitalized her, as described by her main nurse, sisters took that as me opposing it. I wasn‚Äôt. I reiterated the previously discussed and chosen priority of keeping mom at home w dad (and comfortable and pain free) and made it clear I wouldn‚Äôt be the one to decide one way or the other if we are making changes. The fact was that if we sent her via ambulance, there was no guarantee she‚Äôd come back home and the odds were against her.


One sister questioned and doubted our collective decision in regards to the hospice care, which led me to realize she was now having doubts, which was fine. I‚Äôm used to being the target of my family‚Äôs anger or frustration. But bc my individual opinion was to keep her home, the other sister then accused me of ‚Äòtrying to kill mom‚Äô bc that would involve not prioritizing nutrition intake as much as sister was wanting. No one/nothing was keeping mom from food and drink except the after effects of the stroke. I was hurt then angry at the accusations and lashing out at only me, so told them to leave for the night (back to their hotel). We all needed to take a breather.


Then the next next morning I was told by my husband that they both flew back to their homes and relayed to dad that I told them to leave and never come back. I was pissed at this blatant lie. I have been suffering from my own medical problems that had recently kept me from being on my feet for too long (while I wait for my surgery to be scheduled). I was drained, in pain and relieved that they were here to help care for mom. It obviously upset them that I sent them away for the night and so they retaliated by leaving completely. Their selfish actions directed at me, just ended up in their abandoning mom while she was dying and dad as he was in need of all the emotional support he could get.


Four days later, both sisters arrived back at our home about 3 hours after mom passed. All the planning I had put in motion for when this time came was focused on maintaining mom‚Äôs dignity and keeping her comfortable and pain free. I tried my best to make her transition to death as peaceful and lovingly supported as possible and I am proud of having been able to complete that final commitment to my mother.


I also, though, planned so that I could care for mom in peace as I navigated a new and intimidating process. All of that was shot to shit by my sisters and I resent them for that. After mom died, my body and mind just retreated from complete exhaustion. I was so paranoid that I had my husband take off of work and go in w me each and every time so he could witness my giving mom her pain meds as the nurse directed during the last couple of days. My nerves were shot and I knew I just could not emotionally handle anymore of their doubting and insulting me so I placed them both in charge of all the post-death responsibilities. 


We all expected and assumed there‚Äôd be some sort of viewing (as dad requested) and service as I had originally planned, within the next few days before cremation. Instead, we were shocked when sisters took dad and just up and left the very next day (Saturday). The plan had been to have dad go live w another daughter upon mom‚Äôs death to spread the responsibility,  it also bc my husband and I were burned out.


Then on Sunday night we find out that they had their viewing earlier that day, didn‚Äôt tell us and also chose to forego any service. Instead of having a nice service for the family to come together and pay our respects to mom one last time, they scrapped everything, didn‚Äôt communicate w anyone and just left town.


The thing that chaps my ass the most is that they didn‚Äôt even give our sons a chance to say a proper goodbye to their grandma nor to their grandpa, who they possibly may not see alive ever again. It‚Äôs been a week now and I go through the range of grief phases but w less intensity, thankfully, as the days pass. I find comfort in knowing I helped mom in her biggest time of need.


I do wish I had some great, magical advice for you all in similar situations whether it be w an aging parent, someone on hospice or interfamilial drama, but I don‚Äôt. Taking care of aging parents and suddenly (bc it‚Äôs almost always suddenly) becoming responsible for them as their medical issues get more complex is a grueling, self-sacrificing job to take. With my kind and patient husband‚Äôs support, I chose to do it bc I couldn‚Äôt contribute to my parents financially like my sisters have. 


As unsettled, sad and hurt as I felt, at the end of the day, I know how much my husband and I did for the family as a whole in caring for my parents, who were our top priority these past 3 years.


Thank you for taking the time to read my mental and emotional dump. I con only hope it will be a small contribution towards more awareness and helping people to be more comfortable in talking about something that can be quite difficult to face. I‚Äôll be happy to answer any questions you may have. It‚Äôd be nice to know I‚Äôve possibly helped someone else by providing insight based on my experience. ",1,1759644041.0,AgingParents,0,1.0,False

Do I try to move dorms? Do these things get better over time? I‚Äôve never experienced being excluded like this.  I was raised to always include everyone in everything.

The weirdest part is I told my roommate about this and he went ""oh thank god, I thought I was the only one who noticed you do that"" and I was like ""noticed?"" and he said he's been actively avoiding that slot for three years because he knew it was my mug's spot.

1nyg98v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nyg98v/why_wont_my_standing_desk_adjust_to_the_right/,Why won't my standing desk adjust to the right height?,"Hey everyone! I've been dealing with a frustrating issue with my standing desk lately, and I figured I'd share my experience and solutions in case anyone else is facing similar problems. After hours of troubleshooting and research, I've finally figured out what was going on.

First off, if you're having issues with your standing desk not adjusting properly, don't panic! There are several common reasons this might be happening, and most of them are pretty easy to fix.

The most common issue I've found is overloading. Many standing desks have a weight limit that, when exceeded, can cause the desk to stop working properly. I discovered I had way too much stuff on mine - multiple monitors, books, and even my collection of coffee mugs were pushing it over the limit. Once I redistributed some items, it started working perfectly again.

Another frequent culprit is power-related issues. Make sure your desk is properly plugged in and the outlet is working. I felt pretty silly when I realized my desk wasn't adjusting because the power strip it was connected to had been switched off!

Sometimes, the control panel might need a reset. This fixed my issue when the desk wouldn't respond to height adjustments. To reset most standing desks, hold the down button until the desk reaches its lowest position, release, then press and hold again until the desk slightly moves down and up. This resets the memory settings.

If you're in the market for a new standing desk that won't give you these headaches, I recently found this amazing option: https://athometouch.com/standing-desk. It's been super reliable and has some great features for preventing these common issues.

Cable management can also affect height adjustment. Check if any cables are caught or tangled - this can prevent smooth movement. I had a power cable caught in the mechanism once, and it was causing all sorts of problems.

Here's something interesting I learned: temperature and humidity can actually affect the desk's performance. If your desk is in direct sunlight or near a heater, it might act up. Moving it to a more temperature-stable location can help.

If you've tried everything and still having issues, it might be time to consider a replacement. I can personally recommend this desk (https://athometouch.com/standing-desk) - it's been absolutely rock-solid for me, with none of the adjustment issues I had with my previous one.

Remember to regularly clean and maintain your desk's lifting mechanism. A bit of preventive care goes a long way in avoiding adjustment problems. I clean mine monthly, and it's made a huge difference in performance.

Lastly, don't forget to check your warranty! Many manufacturers offer excellent support for these issues. I've found that most companies are pretty helpful when it comes to troubleshooting or replacing parts.

Hope this helps anyone dealing with standing desk troubles! Let me know if you have any questions - I've probably encountered and solved most standing desk issues by now!",1,1759643594.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

Life got busy and stressful so the wedding was on the back burner since we got engaged last year. Some crazy intense personal stuff happened and then we went on a much needed 2 week vacation to Japan.

We knew we wanted it to be small, we knew we wanted our dogs there, and we knew we wanted it on October 1 (Wednesday) because that was our 10 year anniversary.

On July 28, a day after we got back from our trip, is when we started really looking at venues and wedding dresses etc. the search was fairly easy as our wedding was on a Wednesday.

All prices CAD
Location - SK, Canada

The Venue - $3594.60
It was at a hotel so food and a cash bar was included. This was 50% off because it was on a weekday. The food had two mains, two sides, two salads and a dainty tray. This also included coffee, tea, and non alcoholic punch. We had the venue until 11 pm but we ended up leaving at like 7:30.

The Photographer - $1000.00
He is someone I met at a cultural event, he does mainly business headshots and family portraits. He doesn‚Äôt really do weddings but was excited to do ours. This is very cheap for a photographer but from the previews we saw and his portfolio, he‚Äôs good. Got him for 5 hours.

The Officiant - $150.00
She is someone I know from work and her normal rate is $200 but she quoted me at $100 as a wedding present. I threw in the $50 because I love her lol

The Florals - $700.00
There was a swag for the sweetheart table, three arch pieces, four centrepieces, five aisle bouquets. All fake flowers, all rented, all wildflowers. This was a bit more than I was looking to spend on florals but I‚Äôm glad I did. I‚Äôm mostly glad I decided not to do them myself, that saved me so much time.

The Dress - $2246.20
Bought off the rack during a sample sale.

The Invitations - $160.36
We only needed 19 but we bought a pack of 25 with envelopes and stickers. This wasn‚Äôt something we NEEDED but it‚Äôs something we wanted. Totally worth it, they‚Äôre very cute invitations and a nice keepsake for our guests.

The Hair and The Makeup - $0
Both mine and my maid of honour‚Äôs hair and makeup was done by friends of ours as a wedding gift to us. I was very thankful for this, I think I might still give them $100 each in my thank you note.

The Makeup Needed for Application - $162.62
Foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, and glitter.

The Tuxes - $1121.04
My spouse bought his and the best persons. The ones that they had available for rent weren‚Äôt what my spouse wanted so they just bought brand new ones and altered them. He paid for his best person‚Äôs as a gift.

The Bride Shoes - $50.00
Amazon.

The Groom Shoes and Socks - $324.98
He bought two pairs because he couldn‚Äôt decide on brown or black. He also bought three pairs of socks and two for the best person.

The Cake - $418.13
We got one that could feed 30 people. It was two tiered and waaaay too much cake. We have more than half of it sitting in the fridge right now. Includes cake cutting set.

The Marriage License - $60.00

The Rings - $52
Just placeholders for now until we can get ‚Äúreal ones‚Äù. These bought off Amazon.

The Flowers for Bouquets - $134.14
We made our own bouquets. We bought three random bunches of flowers and made them the night before.

The Other Accessories - $48.01
Name cards, vases, dog flowers, other misc. things.

The Bridal Jewelry - $122.10
Just a rose gold necklace with his first initial on it.

The Waxing and Nails - $248.43
Manicure with Shellac polish, Brazilian, half legs, armpits and eyebrows.

The Dogs Pamper - $197.20
They needed to be picture perfect so they both got deluxe spas, hair cuts, nail trims, and light dental cleanings.

The Total - $10,560.61

For 16 guests, 18 people in total, we spent just over $10.5k. We went in with a budget of $10k and I am very happy we stayed within our budget. I feel like it‚Äôs hard to do these days.

We had a great day and our closest friends and families got to be there with us. It was a simple and fun day we will look back on with so much love in our hearts.

Since I finally found a bigger apartment, I now have enough space for an espresso setup.

After doing some research online and asking for advice from coffee shop owners, I‚Äôm finding it quite hard to decide on the right setup. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for your help.

Several coffee shop owners recommended the Sage Barista Express Impress as a good starter machine. However, from what I understand, it‚Äôs not really an upgradable setup since all the parts are integrated, meaning you would need to replace the whole machine if you ever want to upgrade. Unless you want to stop using certain parts of the machine

While looking online, I also came across a lot of recommendations for the Rancilio Silvia and the Profitec Go. But compared to the Save it is a completely different type of machine.

So my question is: what would you recommend buying with a budget of around ‚Ç¨1200? And would you recommend a semi automatic or a seperate set up?",1,1759643213.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

And I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúlistening‚Äù in a casual sense. I mean really listening. Every little sentence, every tiny whisper, every thought that pops up in your head, it‚Äôs all being heard. Not by some external person, not by some imaginary coach, but by you. By the part of you that actually constructs what you notice, what you experience, what lands in front of you every day. This is the part of you that quietly observes, catalogues, interprets, and organizes reality, often without you consciously noticing. It notices patterns, it forms expectations, it files away tiny details, all while you think you‚Äôre just ‚Äúthinking.‚Äù Most people just let words bounce around in their minds like they‚Äôre harmless, like they‚Äôre free-floating, like they‚Äôre meaningless little comments. But they‚Äôre not. Not even close. Each one is a tiny blueprint. Each one is a whisper that says, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how I want the world to line up,‚Äù and your reality listens. It listens in ways you can‚Äôt see, in ways that slowly, quietly shapes the contours of your day, your week, your experiences.

>Think about it. When you mutter quietly to yourself, ‚ÄúUgh, nothing ever works out for me,‚Äù what do you actually mean? You‚Äôre probably just frustrated, you‚Äôve had a rough day, or you‚Äôre annoyed that something didn‚Äôt go as planned. Maybe your alarm didn‚Äôt go off. Maybe someone cut you off in traffic. Maybe a project at work is dragging. Maybe your inbox is overflowing. Maybe a call you were expecting didn‚Äôt come through. Maybe a text went unanswered. Maybe a friend forgot your birthday. Whatever it is, the mind doesn‚Äôt separate the minor from the major, the trivial from the significant. It just hears the statement. It hears the message. And it processes it as fact. That tiny whisper, that quick ‚Äúugh,‚Äù is recorded, interpreted, and used as a lens for how you will see everything else that day. And that lens, whether you notice it or not, filters every encounter, every glance, every word you hear.

And here‚Äôs the part that trips most people up: it‚Äôs subtle, almost invisible. You think it‚Äôs just a moment of frustration. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being honest,‚Äù you tell yourself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just venting.‚Äù But that honesty, that momentary outburst, is quietly designing what your day looks like. You don‚Äôt see it in the instant, and that‚Äôs what makes it dangerous. One fleeting sentence inside your head has power because it‚Äôs received by the part of you that constructs reality. That whisper isn‚Äôt meaningless. It sets up a lens. It frames the world. And suddenly, everywhere you look, there‚Äôs evidence. Evidence that matches the whisper. Evidence that reinforces the story. The coffee that spills, the traffic that backs up, the friend who cancels-they aren‚Äôt proof of bad luck. They‚Äôre simply being noticed through the filter you created. You start interpreting them as confirmation, as validation, as signs that the thought in your head was right.

And this is exactly why self-talk is far from harmless. People underestimate it constantly. They think, ‚ÄúOh, I just thought that for a second, it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù But it does. Every sentence is a blueprint. Every whisper is a framework. Every tiny mutter quietly shapes perception. You might not notice it at the time. You might even think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm positive, I said good things this morning,‚Äù but then a tiny inconvenience happens and the old whisper sneaks in, takes over, and suddenly the day reflects that old story. Your intentions mean nothing if the quiet repeated story is stronger. Your hopes are irrelevant if the mind‚Äôs background chatter is louder. The day unfolds according to the script your whispers have written.

>Let‚Äôs zoom in on that for a second. Imagine two mornings. Morning one: you tell yourself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this. Things are moving. I can handle it.‚Äù You feel energized. You step outside. The world feels lighter. Birds chirp, the sun hits your face, traffic seems manageable, emails are reasonable. It‚Äôs not magic‚Äîit‚Äôs the lens. Your attention is noticing what fits the story you whispered. Now morning two: same mantra, same enthusiasm. But then the coffee spills, the traffic snarls, a bill shocks you. And just like that, the whisper in your head shifts. The background chatter says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this. Nothing works out.‚Äù Instantly, the world you perceive is now framed through that old story. Tiny events now feel heavy. Situations that could be neutral or positive now reinforce doubt. That‚Äôs the power of self-talk. That‚Äôs why noticing what you whisper matters more than any grand plan or thought of ‚Äútrying harder.‚Äù

>Now, imagine the same thing with a longer series of events. Say you‚Äôre heading into a work week. On Monday, you whisper, ‚ÄúThis week is going to be fine. I can handle it.‚Äù Tuesday morning, something goes wrong. You drop a document. A message you were waiting for doesn‚Äôt arrive. And the background whisper from Monday resurfaces. Suddenly, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this‚Äù starts creeping in. You notice more negative emails, more delays, more friction. Not because the world suddenly changed, but because your mind started reading everything through the lens of that whisper. By Wednesday, the pattern is fully in motion. The whisper has created a framework in which every small obstacle now reinforces the same quiet story. By Thursday, you‚Äôre frustrated, exhausted, and convinced that nothing is going right. And all of this started with small, almost invisible whispers in your own head. That‚Äôs how fast and sneaky it is.

And this is where repetition becomes crucial. Not just a single morning mantra, not a single positive thought, but the repeated framework your mind hears. Think of it like walking down a hallway for the first time. Your footsteps echo. The first few steps are tentative. But if you walk the same hallway thousands of times, it becomes automatic. Your mind knows the pattern, the rhythm, the echoes. That‚Äôs what repeated self-talk does. It programs the lens through which every single moment is perceived. The whisper repeated countless times starts to be louder than external noise. You can‚Äôt trick it with one enthusiastic sentence or a single morning affirmation. The background story dominates, and it‚Äôs the one shaping the world.

>Now, consider how this works in practical terms. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to handle a stressful work project. If your internal dialogue says, even quietly, ‚ÄúThis is impossible. I‚Äôll never get it done,‚Äù your mind interprets everything through that filter. Emails seem threatening, colleagues seem critical, small setbacks feel monumental. But if your internal dialogue says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure this out. I can handle each part,‚Äù even quietly, your mind notices things differently. Emails are information, colleagues are collaborators, setbacks are data. The events themselves didn‚Äôt change. The world is neutral. But your perception is entirely framed by the whispers inside. That‚Äôs why the ‚Äúinternal story‚Äù is more powerful than external circumstances.

And let‚Äôs go a step further. Reality isn‚Äôt negotiating with you. It doesn‚Äôt respond to hope, to desire, to good intentions. It responds to the framework you have already built inside your head. Every thought that repeats, every quiet statement, every muttered ‚Äúugh,‚Äù is setting the tone. Life mirrors it. Not magically, not supernaturally, not with judgment-it simply mirrors the lens you‚Äôve already adopted. That‚Äôs why tiny whispers feel like they explode in the world around you. That‚Äôs why small phrases create domino effects. That‚Äôs why self-talk is quietly engineering what shows up in your day.

Being careful with self-talk doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring reality. It doesn‚Äôt mean pretending nothing is wrong. It doesn‚Äôt mean painting over cracks or denying facts. It means noticing the weight of your words, the tone of your sentences, the repeated quiet story. If your internal dialogue is dominated by frustration, limitation, or worry, you will notice it everywhere. If your internal dialogue is calm, clear, focused, even if subtly, the world feels calmer, clearer, easier. It‚Äôs not magic. It‚Äôs simple feedback. The mind processes its own instructions. The lens it applies shapes everything you notice.

And here‚Äôs the final piece: this isn‚Äôt about flipping a switch. You don‚Äôt go from doubt to certainty in a single thought. You notice, you observe, you adjust. You notice the whisper. You watch it. You nudge it. You repeat. Slowly, the old story loosens its grip. Slowly, the new framework embeds. Not because reality changed-reality never changes-but because the story you carry inside started framing it differently. The roads you walk, the interactions you notice, the events you interpret-all subtly shift to match the framework inside. That‚Äôs why paying attention, even quietly, matters so much. The world outside is responding to the story you tell inside, whether you notice it or not.

Self-talk doesn‚Äôt just describe life. It quietly constructs it. You are the narrator, the audience, the builder, and the inhabitant all at once. The words you whisper, the sentences you mutter, the thoughts you think quietly-they are instructions. They are frameworks. They are lenses. The attention you give them amplifies them. The world doesn‚Äôt argue. It doesn‚Äôt negotiate. It mirrors the story you already carry. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt ignore it. That‚Äôs why the whisper matters more than the shout. That‚Äôs why what you notice, what you repeat, what you dwell on-every single line of inner dialogue-shapes every single line of your experience.


Your inner dialogue is not just words-it‚Äôs a force quietly shaping every moment. You may barely notice it, but it dictates what you notice, what draws your attention, what seems important, and what fades into the background. If your thoughts are full of frustration, doubt, or complaint, your desire feels blocked, heavy, distant, like it‚Äôs slipping away before you can even reach it. If your inner voice is steady, clear, calm, even quietly confident, desire begins to emerge, pressing itself into your awareness, noticeable, undeniable, almost demanding attention. The world itself hasn‚Äôt changed. Nothing outside has shifted. But your experience of what you want, what you long for, what you reach for, starts to shift, to take shape, to have weight, presence, and momentum. That‚Äôs the power of self-talk. Every sentence, every mutter, every fleeting thought quietly shapes how desire appears, how it lingers, how it threads through the ordinary moments of your day. The more conscious you are of it, the more it asserts itself, persists, and moves through your awareness, quietly building itself through the whispers you allow in your mind.

I am coming to Paris for a week this month. Here's my interests and places I will visit (so feel free to steer me to another arr. if applicable):

\- Walking! I am an American fl√¢neur!  
\- Bookstores with English books, coffee shops  
\- Authentic frommagiers  
\- Visiting the following tourist sites - the Lourve, Musee D'Orsay, Museum of Cheese, the Catacombs, and possibly the Music Museum or the Sewer Museum. Others I hope to see while walking.

Hotel desires:  
\- Walkable area  
\- Not on a busy street - I am an early to bed, early to rise type  
\- Less than 300 Euro/night

Right now I am looking at Hotel Atmospheres in the Latin Quarter, but concerned it may be too busy/loud at night. Any recommendations would be appreciated.",1,1759643110.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

Act II: We take a walk, debating important topics like whether pineapple belongs on pizza, or if socks in bed are a crime against humanity. You win every argument, mostly because I let you. (Mostly.)

Act III: We hit a bookstore ‚Äújust to browse,‚Äù but leave with three bags and zero shelf space at home. On the way back, we get caught in traffic and I attempt to sing along to the radio. You either join in or put in headphones, no in-between.

Finale: We realize we‚Äôre not meant to live glamorous Netflix-series lives... just two slightly awkward humans trying to eat too much ice cream, laugh at dumb memes, and figure out how to fold fitted sheets without summoning demons.

1nyg1bu,https://i.redd.it/k9j6we5id8tf1.jpeg,SLEEP DISORDER PSA,"Hi Biohackers, 

I notice a lot of posts in here about people trying to beat fatigue and feel awake. A reasonable struggle, that I resonate deeply with. 

However, as someone with Narcolepsy type 2, that I was diagnosed with in 2018, and the only reason I found out I was narcoleptic was because of someone spreading awareness at a Comic Con about the condition, I want to help spread awareness further to other people who might not realize that their level of fatigue is NOT NORMAL!!! 

Being tired is so easy to be normalized, people so often say ""don't talk to me before I've had my coffee"", ""oh my gosh I need more caffeine for this"", etc, etc. Especially in our crushing capitalistic society that values ""the grind"" so much. It's a lot of pressure to be productive all the time, and people are left feeling inadequate when they can't keep up. 

The sad fact is, sleeping disorders are highly under diagnosed because doctors rarely think to point you in that direction- they will say your Vitamin D is low, you're not being active enough, diet issues, you have depression; whatever. I heard it ALL in the journey to getting my diagnosis, before I got the tip off to actually go to a SLEEP SPECIALIST and get tested. 

Yes, I still use things like the tactics in this bio hacking forum to optimize how I'm feeling on top of my medication and diagnosis, but managing my symptoms is so much easier with KNOWING that I have an underlying condition. 

I wanted to share this Epworth Sleepiness Scale for others to see- you can take the survey yourself and see the results, if you have a high score, it may indicate that you have a sleeping disorder that you should investigate with a sleep specialist!!! There are others besides narcolepsy and sleep apnea, like hypersomnia, etc. 

Even if you do not have a score worth concern, please upvote to help get more visibility on this; as biohacking around a condition can be so much more effective once you KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A CONDITION. 

Our brains are not all wired the same. Sleeping disorders are not very well understood even by modern science, but a large part of that is because not enough people look at their sleep and recognize the problem for it to be studied more in depth. Please take the time to consider if your fatigue is normal, or if there may be something else at play. Getting a diagnosis can be life changing and affirming to your struggles, that are not the same as the average person's struggles.

For context, me and my boyfriend met each other through our mothers (they met at a book club and decided that we'd be a good match). Like all married women do, they went out for chats at coffee shops and talked some shit about their husbands... well my mom was filing for divorce since she caught my dad cheating (ever since, she and I have been very close).

Anyways, my mom did not grow fond of my boyfriend's dad just because she had lost trust for all men; she heard from my bfs mom that he would suddenly come home late from work, put in less effort, etc.. basically all the weird and obvious signs that a man is cheating.

Fast forward 4 months, I was out with a close friend of mine just catching up and she was telling me about her encounters on datings apps- btw she has a thing for wayyy older men (daddy issues ofc) and showed me the people she matched with and some of her ""memorable"" encounters.

To sum it up, she was sharing her experience with this 57 year old ""blue"" collar man who was in search of a sugar baby. At first she didn't believe it and thought that he was some pimp or some trafficker but eventually (through chatting) found out that he was wealthy bc he sent her $200 bucks for some weird stinky peanut butter covered pic of her feet.

Anyways, I was disgusted at this encounter but a girls gotta do what she gotta do, so my friend obviously engaged with this guy and over time (couple weeks of chatting) and decided to meet in person for a ""fully paid"" session. She said she met this guy at some hotel in NY; he was decently fit for his age and ""seemed"" normal... that is until they went into their hotel room.

She didn't get into the nitty gritty details but told me he had some weird ass fetish surrounding peanut butters. then she started scrolling up the chat and thats when I saw it...when i saw him... my bf's dad's picture. at first, I didn't know how to react. I obviously hid the fact that I was acquainted with him and never told my friend about my bf's dad. It also clicked to me that my bf and his mom have severe peanut allergy... it all clicked bc peanut butter was banned in their house.

I didn't know how or if I should let my bf know and i was too scared since our engagement was on the way. I panicked. I also knew how heartbreaking it would be for my bf's mother since I first handedly dealt with my mom's divorce. I know what I did wasn't the most ethical or smartest decision but I decided to gather my bf's dads dating profile and evidence to support his unfaithfulness. i made a fake account, chatted with him, asked about his personal life (denied he had kids or a wife), and his weird fetishes. I collected all of these and decided to mail it over anonymously to my bf's childhood house. My bf told me that they're going through a divorce now.

A user of 17 years under my belt, everyday, all day kind of thing.  
I've quit smoking completely about 4 months ago, and being into endurance sports, I've discovered I have high systolic blood pressure.

I am 29 years old, 186cm, 85kg, athletic build, no medications apart from 3000mg daily omega3 supplement and no prior issues or illnesses.  
Exercising 6 times a week, mostly twice a day. Since I was 16, was engaged in one sport or another, currently triathlon.

I've eliminated coffee  
I've reduced sodium to 2300mg daily and I eat fairly clean  
The only one thing I have left to stabilize is waking up to pee in the middle of the night, which I never really had to do but started in the recent time, probably since I've quit..

I cannot help but think that its the long year cannabis use, and while I'm currently monitoring the situation with my doctors and am willing to change lifestyle, I cannot get below 137-135 systolic BP!

Did anyone else had any problems with high blood pressure after quitting?

\*I'd like to note, that when I smoke, my BP normalizes, during the time I smoke - but that all makes physical sense since it really helps with the BP.  
\*Have no diseases or such and I am in my late 20s, healthy, not overweight and pretty much athletic since I'm doing triahlons.

Would love your opinions and experiences on that one,

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Our necessary expenses are not excessive - we have a c. ¬£2k mortgage and reasonable bills, plus limited running/insurance/parking costs of a secondhand car. We don't have any regular lifestyle splurges like ¬£300+ gym memberships etc. We do eat out, but look for meals in the ¬£20-¬£30 pp range rather than ¬£50+.

However, given how much we both earn, it should be possible to save more. The money is just going on little enjoyments/necessities. It's important to be happy in the day-to-day and I am not interested in being completely frugal (I did enough of that while studying). I'm interested in whether people have any suggestions of useful mental lines to draw to prevent excessive spending on day-to-day luxuries? I've had some success in only allowing myself one shop-bought coffee per week, for example.

1nyfzlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nyfzlv/aita_for_making_my_bfs_parents_divorce/,AITA for Making my bfs parents divorce,"My boyfriend (30 M) and I (27 F) have been together for 6 years... we are planning to get engaged soon and I'm unsure whether to tell him the truth or not.

For context, me and my boyfriend met each other through our mothers (they met at a book club and decided that we'd be a good match). Like all married women do, they went out for chats at coffee shops and talked some shit about their husbands... well my mom was filing for divorce since she caught my dad cheating (ever since, she and I have been very close).

Anyways, my mom did not grow fond of my boyfriend's dad just because she had lost trust for all men; she heard from my bfs mom that he would suddenly come home late from work, put in less effort, etc.. basically all the weird and obvious signs that a man is cheating.

Fast forward 4 months, I was out with a close friend of mine just catching up and she was telling me about her encounters on datings apps- btw she has a thing for wayyy older men (daddy issues ofc) and showed me the people she matched with and some of her ""memorable"" encounters.

To sum it up, she was sharing her experience with this 57 year old ""blue"" collar man who was in search of a sugar baby. At first she didn't believe it and thought that he was some pimp or some trafficker but eventually (through chatting) found out that he was wealthy bc he sent her $200 bucks for some weird stinky peanut butter covered pic of her feet.

Anyways, I was disgusted at this encounter but a girls gotta do what she gotta do, so my friend obviously engaged with this guy and over time (couple weeks of chatting) and decided to meet in person for a ""fully paid"" session. She said she met this guy at some hotel in NY; he was decently fit for his age and ""seemed"" normal... that is until they went into their hotel room.

She didn't get into the nitty gritty details but told me he had some weird ass fetish surrounding peanut butters. then she started scrolling up the chat and thats when I saw it...when i saw him... my bf's dad's picture. at first, I didn't know how to react. I obviously hid the fact that I was acquainted with him and never told my friend about my bf's dad. It also clicked to me that my bf and his mom have severe peanut allergy... it all clicked bc peanut butter was banned in their house.

I didn't know how or if I should let my bf know and i was too scared since our engagement was on the way. I panicked. I also knew how heartbreaking it would be for my bf's mother since I first handedly dealt with my mom's divorce. I know what I did wasn't the most ethical or smartest decision but I decided to gather my bf's dads dating profile and evidence to support his unfaithfulness. i made a fake account, chatted with him, asked about his personal life (denied he had kids or a wife), and his weird fetishes. I collected all of these and decided to mail it over anonymously to my bf's childhood house. My bf told me that they're going through a divorce now. AITA?

The rot on my wall talks to me.


I'm writing this because I'm well now and my life has been changed for the better.


I want to trauma dump and continue on a fresher path. 

The story I'm about to tell is from 22 years ago.

I was 22 at the time. 
How fitting the time line is,
 44 is the age I will talk to him again and the age I am at  the moment I write this.

Dont worry im an otherwise formal and straight to the point kind of guy. 
I don't write too often but I like it. 
I say this for the people that read me. 
This is not for the faint of heart. 
I'm not trying to be interesting. 


At 22 years old, I lived in a room that a friend rented to me. 
I say, a friend but I didn't really know Jeff. 
Kind of a shy guy, in his own world.
It was hard  to start  conversations  and have a connection with him.
I tried. 
I could  feel he wasn't interested in being more than just roomies. 

Small hello‚Äôs, awkward systematic conversations.
 I found myself alone, drinking beers and smoking hashish in my room at night after work.

As time passed I developed a routine. 
Waking  at 12 P.M.
Drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes till 2 P.M.
Eating, drinking water and taking a shower till 4 P.M.
At 4:30 P.M., I was at work. 
For an 8 hour shift as a janitor. 
By 1 A.M I was back in my room,
drinking and smoking. 
One problem tho‚Äô is that I wouldn't want to bother Jeff so I literally stayed in my room.
Buying food and eating in it without cleaning the crumbs.
I would drink beer and piss in empty can‚Äôs when needed.
 I left greasy food on the floor that transforms into gooey, hairy, soft cancer filled balls.
I didn't care. 

Plastic food packings everywhere.
 Can‚Äôs full of piss just laying where I could find a place to leave them.


This all sounds crazy.
I swear,
 I was trying to be the perfect roommate.
 Paid on time, never bothered him.
 I would lock my door and he never knew  anything that was going on beyond my  door room.

It all went to a point where I couldn't even walk in it freely. 
had a designated place for me to lay on my bed and that's it. 
All because I didn't want to bother him.

My thinking was at the time that the hours I came back home didn't coordinate with the hours Jeff was home or most of the time he was sleeping when I was there and vice versa.
 It just didn't add up, so I didn't clean anything because I was afraid I would wake him up if I did.

I would spill some beer or urine on my floor, by knocking them over in some drunk event‚Äôs and fit‚Äôs.
Clumpsy, depressing things would happen in that room. 

I tried to clean it the best I could but in the back of my mind I knew this was a chaotique disgusting mess and that I didn't know how to repair or get rid of all  this.

I just let it go and grow. 
The mess was so unrealistic that I coped  by not acknowledging it. 
I was delusional.
Playing games and jerking too meat on a screen.
Disgusting slops  and moist contaminated air could be felt in this room.
 I sensed it.
 I also had a sense of defeat, like there is no way I can stop this. 
This room was more powerful than me.
I couldn't stop it.
I just lived amongst filth. 
Bowing to it in submission.  


One day, on my birthday,  the 22nd of February 2022. 

I was laying in my bed filled with junk. 
Lonely as can be. 
Scrolling on my phone.

When I heard a small voice echoing in front of me.

 Voice: Hello!

I stood up on my bed in a heartbeat!
Looking at my wall I saw nothing but grey paint. 
I could feel my face going numb and my blood wanting to spur out of my ears. 
I froze, only to listen to absolutely nothing for approximately 8 minutes.
It stunned me.
 This was the first time I felt shocked like this in a long time.

Staring at my wall I realised that my woodin‚Äô poster of Startrek: Next generation was resting on said grey wall.

Proceed to make way for me to stand in front of it and remove it from the wall. 

Mold! 

Black mold everywhere on the wall behind where once was the  Startrek poster. 

In disbelief,
  I replaced the poster back where it was and jumped back on my bed. 

I said to myself.

Where did this fucking  voice come from? 

Realising that maybe there is somebody behind my door, I said out loud.

Who's there?

No response.
Yes, 8 minutes of no sound and  I demanded who it was. 

It didn't sound like my roommate.
I slowly got down from my bed  and opened my door.
 Only to look at an eerie blacked-out apartment.
 I could only see  time on the stove, glowing a green bright light which showed 22:44 P.M.


Voice: No here guy, you had me.
I'm right here!

Shaken once again by the voice coming from my room, I bounced out of it and closed the door.

I went out so fast I'm pretty sure my shadow still wanders close to this apartment complex to this day.

  I felt like I was gonna‚Äô faint.

Standing there outside my room, 
my mind couldn't fathom what was happening.
 
Darkness surrounded me.
So I urgently went to open the lights of the corridor connecting to my bedroom door. 

The switch light snapped up and instantly I heard in a snappy way.

Oh wow ok! 

At least that's what I think I heard coming from inside my room. 

The voice had a happy tone to it.
Unsettling, charismatique voice. 

So much so that this is what made me walk back slowly to it.

In the now bright hallway, I walked back to the voice behind my half opened world.  
Weird because I could have sworn I closed my door shut.

I stepped on a tile on the floor, which broke instantly with pressure.
 The cracking and moving sound of the floor made me jump back, leaning my ass  on the corridor wall behind me. 
Instantly replacing myself in walking stature right away. 
I felt like a robot or some‚Äô, 
Adrenaline was pumping. 

My mind was telling me to run out the apartment but my body continued. 

Now at my door, I push it open all the way. 

Fixating at Capt. Picard's  face on the Startrek  poster. 

I can now see a black line spreading slowly on my wall from under the poster. 
I couldn't believe it.
I got a step closer and it spread a little more, swerving to the right.

Confused, I looked around in the mess I called my room.
 Spotted my cigarettes and lighter.
Rushed to take one out of the pack.

Click!  

As soon as I ignited the fire I heard.

Yes ah yes! I like that smell. 

I jumped again and as I did my hand swiped the burning part of my cigarette. 
Making a mini explosion of little pieces of burning firebrand going everywhere and some landing on my foot. 

Aaah fuck!
 
I said, quickly stomping on them and successfully  smothering all the bright little firebrands I see. 


Voice: Hahahaha! You're a funny guy! 


In anger but trying to be calm in my tone of voice I said.

Who the fuck are you?

Voice: Funny you say this as you made me. 

Scared as hell, I realise the voice is coming from the moldy wall. 
As weird as it sounds, I was about to speak to my wall.

With plenty of emotions coming out of my domineer I said with a small desperate voice.

What the fuck is going on?

Voice: Come closer my friend, it will all make sense in due time. 

I felt like I had to. 
So I went closer and saw my wall. 
The thin black line grew on the grey paint  like a root. 
Small tiny lines going left and right with a bigger fatter line in the middle. 
I was in awe. 
It surely was disgusting but beautiful at the same time.

Voice: Yes you see me properly now! Hahahaha! 

It was like it knew what I was thinking.

Voice: Can you please take off this thing in front of me? 
It's been hindering my breathing for so long. 
Hehe!
Plus, I like that brand of tobacco,
 smells sooo‚Äô goood‚Äô!

Mesmerised by the words I heard,
 I decided to obey.

Now free, I could see a rotting, moldy hole on the wall.
 Perfectly oval, the size of a human eye. 
 The middle of it is matte black.
Blacker then inside a black bear's ass. 


Writer: I think I should leave it at that for the night.
I'm getting tired and saying weird shit.
I don't want to derail and end up saying things for no reason like I'm doing right now.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

As someone who struggles to find a perfume that doesn't give me a *major* headache, I'm so happy that I can say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS HOUSE!! The projection isn't crazy, but for me, that's a good thing. They are definitely buildable fragrances depending on how much you spray! I wanted to give my reviews to help others decide which scent to try :)

  
**Aliens Go Ice Skating** \[winter air, sparkling snow, iris, black pepper, Indian vetiver, peru balsam, cocoa butter, tonka bean butter, tonka bean absolute, cashmere scarves, and a strangely colored sky\]

* Opens with a blast of cold air! It smells like you're driving through the snow with the windows¬†down, and you have pine and mint car fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror. I definitely get the black pepper, which gives the effect of menthol, despite there being no mint listed! Unfortunately, I didn't get any sweetness or creaminess from the tonka bean or butters, which is what I was hoping for, and instead got full menthol and vetiver. **3/10**
* *TL;DR: was expecting a cold, minty vanilla, but got straight cold winter forest. Very unique!*



**C'est Noel** \[Coffee, freshly baked cinnamon bread, roasted chestnuts, blown out candles, lingering church incense, and softly falling snow\]

* This is such a nostalgic Christmas scent! It reminds me of those unlabeled red candles... I love how the spicy cinnamon is balanced by the roasted chestnuts and fresh bread. The coffee, along with the cinnamon, adds a bit of bitterness to keep it from being a sweet fragrance. I'm considering getting a FS for the holidays. **8/10**
* Boyfriend's review = smells like cookies
* *TL;DR: a Christmas breakfast of fresh cinnamon bread and a pot of black coffee in the background*



**Don't Whistle in the Woods** \[Cedar, sandalwood, cypriol, fir balsam, black vanilla, sugar, ambrette, and a hint of fur\]

* This might be my perfect vanilla scent. It's sweet and woody, and there is a slight musk from the fur, which I can only imagine is how a sleepy kitty smells. I also find this to have a bit of spice from the wood notes. It's so addictive I actually can't stop sniffing myself throughout the day, and I *swear* my skin smells WARM. Getting a FS ASAP. **10/10**
* *TL;DR: ultimate sleepy kitty scent of warm, spicy, vanilla woods.*



**Dragonfly Wings** \[White lotus absolute, jasmine sambac absolute,¬†umeshu (also known as plum wine), peonies, sparkling lake water, white rice, lily pads, cotton, blonde woods, and a hint of pink pepper\]

* This is a starchy, floral rice fragrance. The rice smells toasted and warm, and is only held back from being savory by the soft lotus and jasmine floating throughout. It almost smells like the inside of a Chinatown boba shop? I personally don't love the starchiness on my skin, but if you like rice perfumes, I highly recommend trying this out. **7/10**
* Boyfriend's review = mmmm smells like rice
* *TL;DR: starchy rice and soft, sweet florals.*



**English Major** \[Library books, orris absolute, marshmallow,¬†decalepis hamiltonii absolute\*, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves\]

* This smells cozy in an old, dusty way. It smells like a beloved library book with soft, worn pages. It's the perfect scent for someone who wants to bundle up in their favorite, oversized wool sweater and study for an exam in their local library. The orris and marshmallow give a subtle sweetness and creaminess that balances the earthiness from the books and leaves. I'll use up my sample to see if I want a bigger size. **7.5/10**
* Boyfriend's review = smells like a cozy, herbal tea
* *TL;DR: smells like an old, well-loved sweater. Sometimes I can't tell if it's more of a dusty or sweet scent... but it's cozy nevertheless.*



**Fuckery** \[Caramelized sugar, Luxardo cherry, cinnamon, tobacco, smoke, vanilla, amber, white musk\]

* Smells like my beloved little sample of Tom Ford's Cherry Smoke, but juicer. The syrupy sweetness of the cherry blends well with the smoke and musks. This is what I imagine a woman who loves dark red lipstick and leopard print wears to a jazz bar. I wish it were a little bit smokier/darker, but I would consider a FS for the cold winter nights out. **7.5/10**
* *TL;DR: a sexy, syrupy cherry that does NOT smell like cough syrup.*



**In Dreams and Fairy Tales - Vanilla** \[Baked meringue, vanilla bean absolute, sugar, a sprinkle of chamomile\]

* Another perfect vanilla. The chamomile is subtle, but adds a slightly herbal note that reminds me of a cup of chamomile tea. I can imagine wearing this year-round and layering this with my other perfumes. It's sweet and soft like powdered sugar. I want to FS. **10/10**
* *TL;DR: a beautiful, dry, airy vanilla with just a hint of something else to keep it interesting*



**Seance** \[Campari, orange, cinnamon,¬†jasmine sambac absolute, immortelle absolute, ambrette, vanilla sugar, smoked amber, salt, Australian sandalwood oil, cashmere woods\]

* This is such a warm, sweet, and spicy fragrance. Usually, I don't gravitate towards citrus notes, but the orange in here is subtle and juicy, rather than sour or bitter. This smells like if the classic pumpkin spice was made with sugared oranges instead! Such a lovely, cozy scent for fall, and although it didn't last long on my skin, I would definitely consider FS. **8/10**
* Boyfriend's review = smells floral and like honey
* *TL;DR: a sweet, spiced fall scent with a subtle orange note in the background.*

  
**Serpentine** \[Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super\]

* I'm used to the creamy fig, but this was the exact opposite. It starts off green and woody, the bitterness of the leaves overshadowing the spiced fig. This quickly balances as the fig becomes a bit riper and spicier. I would describe this fragrance as a newly ripe fig cast in amber resin that's stuck to a tree. It's an adult Fig Newton. I would consider a FS. **8.5/10**
* Boyfriend's review = smells like a fall-spiced soda
* *TL;DR: a sexy, spicy, woody, adult fig scent*

1nyfob5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelSolutions/comments/1nyfob5/to_those_of_you_trying_to_help_but_getting/,To those of you trying to help but getting frustrated with push-back - here's why it's happening and what you can do,"I‚Äôll try not to make this one too long, since I‚Äôve already wracked my brain pumping out two novels worth of advice. However, **this really needs to be said because a lot of people on this sub aren‚Äôt understanding why their good intentions are being met with abject hostility.**

Look, I understand how frustrating and annoying it is to take time out of your day to give some genuinely good advice ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre coming from a place of personal experience. And I also fully understand that feeling you get when you give practical, actionable advice, only to be met with ‚ÄúThat won't work‚Äù or ‚ÄúI've tried everything‚Äù or just ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù It's fucking exhausting.

**But I must beg you to be patient and understand what is actually going on!**

When talking to someone who is neurodivergent ‚Äì and the majority of us on this sub are (including me) ‚Äì we have this thing in our head called **Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA)**, which is science speak for stubbornness on steroids.

It‚Äôs a psychological profile where the nervous system perceives demands (even beneficial ones) as threats, triggering an anxiety response that makes people resist or avoid them.

It's brutal because the person **KNOWS** the thing would help them. They might desperately **WANT** to do it. But the moment it becomes a **""should""** or **""must,""** their brain treats it like an existential threat and shuts down. Even self-imposed demands can trigger it.

Do you know that feeling you get when you get up and decide you are going to clean your room, but then your mother marches in and yells at you to clean your room, even though you were already going to do it anyways? And now you want to trash the room even further as an extra fuck you to the demands hoisted upon you by another person?

Now imagine that feeling, but with every piece of advice you receive, even when you desperately want help. That‚Äôs PDA in a nutshell.

I understand it‚Äôs incredibly easy to flip your hands in the air and just shout ‚Äúfine, fuck you too, this is why you‚Äôre stuck the way you are, because you refuse to lift a fucking finger to help yourself!‚Äù and walk away.

The problem is you really shouldn‚Äôt do that. And I‚Äôm not tone-policing when I say that. I mean **you really should not do that**, because deep down, we fully understand the advice is good. And when you decide to walk away (which is perfectly reasonable), our brains then gaslight us into believing that we are unlovable, that we deserve the pain we feel, and you become ‚Äúanother person‚Äù who meant well, but gave up on us.

**And we live in a world where most people give up on us.**

This isn‚Äôt a pity party, and I‚Äôm not asking you to set yourself on fire to keep others warm. I‚Äôm trying to explain what‚Äôs going on in that maze of electrical short circuits and crossed wires that is our ability to process and interpret information.

Yes ‚Äì we know it‚Äôs not your fault we react the way we do. Yes ‚Äì we fully understand it is OUR responsibility to take control of our lives. No ‚Äì we really don‚Äôt hold it against you when you get frustrated at us; if anything, we beat ourselves up even more.

And more importantly, **deep down we really do value and appreciate the help you offer us. We‚Äôre just too angry and stubborn to admit it.**

Unlike neurotypical people, whenever we try to pump ourselves up and take action to regain control in our lives, we are physically fighting our nervous system.

That's why a lot of self-help advice backfires for neurodivergent people. The more they're told what they ""should"" do, the more their nervous system rebels. It's not laziness or self-sabotage - it's a neurological response to perceived loss of autonomy.

This is partially why I am so good at giving advice to people, because I have spent over a decade learning about myself, how my brain works, how to identify when my brain is being a dick to me, and how to handle it. But not everybody had the same help that I had. And more importantly, not everybody has the same resilience YOU have.

**So once again, please try and understand what is going on and have some patience.**

That being said, what do you do about it? If you are trying to give advice that is really good, how do you do it in a way that increases the chances of it being received?

¬†

**The solution is to work WITH it, not AGAINST it.**

Fighting it is a losing battle. Fighting them on it is a losing battle. Remember Avatar: The Last Airbender? When Uncle Iroh is teaching to Zuko how to redirect lighting?

That‚Äôs what you do. You‚Äôre redirecting the lightning. You can‚Äôt fight it, because it‚Äôll blow up in your face. When you hear statements like ‚ÄúI've tried everything"", or ""That won't work for me"", or ""You don't understand my situation"", that‚Äôs the lightning. It‚Äôs the brain shutting down to protect themselves from demand anxiety. You can‚Äôt fight that, but you CAN redirect it.

**The key to redirecting is by avoiding telling people what to do.**

Using ""should"" as a verb is called ""shoulding"", and my therapist spoke extensively on it. Because deep down, it's controlling language. When you tell people they ""should"" do this or they ""shouldn't"" be saying this or that, you are trying to control how they think or feel. And that will be instantly shut down and dismissed. 

(And yes, I see the irony - I just told you that you ""shouldn't"" aggressively walk away. That's because I'm **warning you** about **harm**, not controlling your response to it. There's a difference, even if my PDA brain hates both.)

Instead, share what worked for you. Offer personal anecdotes, show them multiple paths. If you try to pigeonhole them into one or two solutions, they will feel they are being cornered and become instantly resistant. Think about it:

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre feeling tired all the time, and you are told ‚Äúthe ONLY solution is to sleep more!‚Äù But‚Ä¶ You tried?

‚ÄúOkay, go to bed early and fix your sleep schedule!‚Äù

But I work nights.

‚ÄúThen go to bed and sleep during the day.‚Äù

But I can‚Äôt, sun is out.

‚ÄúThen get blackout curtains.‚Äù

Those are expensive, and I don‚Äôt have time.

‚ÄúThen the problem isn‚Äôt your sleep schedule, the problem is YOU! You can‚Äôt spare $40 to get curtains that will HELP fix your problem? What do you mean you don‚Äôt have time? That just means you have a financial and time management issue, not sleep!‚Äù

See how dismissive and cold that feels?

I get that this is how a lot of people operate. Yes, those solutions work, but when you're the one struggling, there's resistance because you've already thought about black out curtains, you've thought about sleeping more, but you're genuinely struggling with making that decision.

Also, in this little scenario, did it occur to you to ask about how much caffeine is being consumed? People who work nights and sleep during the day tend to drink more coffee and energy drinks on average. But that information never came to light because the person offering advice just stuck to their ‚Äúdo this and that and if you don‚Äôt then the problem is you.‚Äù, which is honestly pretty back-handed.

So what would ‚Äúredirecting the lightning‚Äù look like? Instead of telling them to get blackout curtains or sleep more, it would be along the lines of this:

‚ÄúMan, I used to be exhausted all the time too. Tried everything - melatonin, blackout curtains, even those stupid sleep apps. What finally worked for me was cutting caffeine after 2pm, but my buddy swears by magnesium supplements. Another guy I know just accepted he's nocturnal and built his whole life around it. What's your current sleep situation like?‚Äù

See that? Options. And it‚Äôs not fighting it. They can take it or leave it, yet they are not pressured or feeling funneled into ‚Äúmy way or the highway.‚Äù Their PDA brain sees escape routes everywhere. They can take what resonates, ignore what doesn't, or file it away for later when they ""randomly"" decide to try something that was ""totally their idea.""

(You would be surprised how often that happens. I‚Äôm dead serious!)

Instead of: ""Just talk to women, bro!""

Try: ""I noticed I got better at talking to everyone once I stopped treating women like a different species. Started with cashiers, asked the librarian about book recommendations. moved up to actual conversations. Still awkward sometimes but whatever.""

Instead of: ""Stop making excuses, bro!""

Try: ""Yeah, the brain is really good at protecting us from stuff that might help. Mine still does it. Sometimes I trick it by doing things badly on purpose just to get started.""

See how it‚Äôs less judgmental? See how it‚Äôs just weaved in there without overtly telling them what to do? This is how we operate. Not all of us, of course, but it‚Äôs better than shoving advice in their face on the grounds that ‚Äúit worked for me.‚Äù

**The trick is that you're not removing the demand, you're diffusing it across so many options that their brain can't identify what to resist. In other words: you‚Äôre redirecting the lightning.**

**The moment you try to control how they should think or feel, YOU become the threat their brain is protecting them from.**

**Remember: You're not failing when they resist.**

Their brain is literally protecting them from perceived threats. Keep planting seeds. Some will grow when their nervous system feels safe enough to let them. Share experiences. Offer options. Let them come to their own conclusions. Please be patient, it‚Äôs not personal.

And to those struggling with PDA reading this: Yeah, your brain probably wants to reject everything I just wrote. That's fine. Save it, forget about it, and maybe in three weeks you'll ""randomly"" decide to try something that was totally your idea. I've been there. Hell, I'm STILL there sometimes.

The point is, we're all trying to help each other here. Some of us just need the help delivered in a way our brains won't immediately weaponize against us.

**TL;DR:** Stop shoulding all over people. Share what worked, offer options, let them choose. Their resistance isn't personal - it's neurological. Work with it, not against it. Redirect the lightning.",1,1759641559.0,IncelSolutions,0,1.0,False

I want to make a sunflower-seed-flavored hard candy that's just salty, not sweet. ChatGPT came up with a recipe, but I don't know enough about candy making or cooking in general to know if it might actually work or if it's completely ridiculous. What do y'all think?

Here's the ChatGPT response:

Savory Sunflower Seed Hard Candy (Test Batch)
Yields about 12‚Äì15 small candies (around 100 g total)
---
Ingredients:
- 100 g (¬Ω cup) isomalt (used for sugar-free candies)
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon fine salt (adjust to taste later)
- 30 g (about ¬º cup) roasted unsalted sunflower seeds
- ¬º teaspoon MSG (optional, adds umami depth)
- ‚Öõ teaspoon soy sauce powder (optional, enhances roasted flavor)
- A pinch of baking soda (optional, gives a faint ‚Äúshell dust‚Äù taste)
- Neutral oil or cooking spray (for greasing molds or parchment)
---
Equipment:
- Small heavy saucepan or pot
- Candy thermometer (digital is fine)
- Heat-resistant silicone spatula
- Small strainer or fine mesh sieve
- Parchment paper or silicone mat
- Spoon or small silicone candy molds
- Heatproof gloves or oven mitts
---
Step 1: Make the sunflower extract

1. If your sunflower seeds aren‚Äôt roasted, spread them on a baking sheet and roast at 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) for 6‚Äì8 minutes until fragrant.

2. Crush them lightly with the back of a spoon or a mortar and pestle.

3. Put the crushed seeds in a small pot with ¬Ω cup of water. Simmer gently for 5 minutes.

4. Strain through a fine mesh sieve or coffee filter into a small bowl. You‚Äôll get a light brown sunflower seed ‚Äútea.‚Äù

You only need 1 tablespoon of this extract for the candy. (You can freeze the rest for later.)
---
Step 2: Cook the candy base

1. Combine 100 g isomalt and 1 tablespoon water in your saucepan.

2. Place over medium heat. Do not stir once it starts melting; instead, swirl the pan gently if needed.

3. When it starts bubbling, attach your thermometer.

4. Heat until the syrup reaches 320¬∞F (160¬∞C), also known as the hard crack stage. This will take about 8‚Äì10 minutes. The syrup should be clear and fluid.
---
Step 3: Add flavoring

1. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly for 30‚Äì60 seconds (down to about 275¬∞F / 135¬∞C).

2. Carefully stir in the following:
- 1 tablespoon sunflower extract
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¬º teaspoon MSG (optional)
- ‚Öõ teaspoon soy sauce powder (optional)
- A pinch of baking soda (optional)
It will bubble up‚Äîstir gently until combined.
Taste a tiny cooled drop on a spoon. If it‚Äôs not salty enough, add another ¬º teaspoon salt while it‚Äôs still hot.
---
Step 4: Pour and cool

1. Immediately pour small spoonfuls of the syrup onto parchment paper or into lightly greased candy molds.

2. Let sit at room temperature for 30‚Äì60 minutes until hard.

3. Once cool, break into pieces if needed and store in an airtight container.

The candies will firm up completely in about 24 hours, and the flavor will mellow slightly overnight.
---
Tips:
- If the candy tastes too sweet, add a bit more salt or sunflower extract next time.
- If it tastes too plain, add a little more MSG or soy powder.
- For more of a ‚Äúshell‚Äù flavor, use an extra pinch of baking soda.
- If the candies get sticky, store them with a silica gel packet or in a very dry container‚Äîhumidity softens isomalt.
---
Result:
You‚Äôll get shiny amber candies that smell like roasted sunflower seeds and taste salty, savory, and nutty‚Äîlike a mouthful of sunflower seeds, without the mess.",0,1759641021.0,CandyMakers,1,0.33,False

1nyfdzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nyfdzc/i_was_stranded_in_an_old_railway_station/,I was stranded in an old railway station,"It was mid-afternoon and I was already on the highway, four long hours of empty road ahead, flowers and chocolate on the seat beside me.

I had a long night of heated argument with my girlfriend. The guilt of poisoning the relationship with my jealousy and insecurity hit me hard. She will be gone for a medical camp for a week from tonight and the thought of her going with only my harsh words between us gnawed at me. I had to make things right, in person.

It was 6:10 PM when I reached her place. I buzzed her apartment. I went in with flowers, chocolate and a heart full of apology. I owned up my mistake, stumbled through apologies until my heart felt light, and I bent a knee, ‚ÄúSarah June Merrickson, will you accept my apology‚Äù. The smile that intercepted her tears is worth the long drive after a sleepless night. She pulled me in and for the few next hours the world was only us‚Äîsoft voices, kisses, silence heavy with things unsaid.

But the clock doesn‚Äôt wait. She has her train at 11:05 PM and I was driving her to the station.

‚ÄúI wish I could travel to the camp with you‚Äù, I said.  
She mocked, ‚ÄúMaybe surprise me by showing up at my tent at the camp.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚ÄúMaybe I will.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne day you are going to run of all the romantic ideas and that's gonna be the end of it.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI doubt that‚Äù I winked.

She rolled her eyes, ‚ÄúDon't flatter yourself‚Äù.

We reached the station at 11 PM. The station was deserted. We were the only people in the station.

The loudspeaker crackled, ‚ÄúThe 11:05 service is delayed by at least thirty minutes.‚Äù

Sarah squeezed my hand, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a long drive. I‚Äôll be fine on my own.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you off. I‚Äôm heading to my mom‚Äôs anyway‚Äîforty minutes. I‚Äôll stay.‚Äù

Then, against the announcement, the train whistle screamed. Doors slid open. We kissed once again, as she boarded and disappeared inside with the flowers and chocolates in her hands.

As the train started to move, I turned back to my own drive.

I got into the car. The GPS said that I am approximately 7 miles away from highway. I continued on the same road from the railway station.¬†

The road was black, broken asphalt under my headlights, no other traffic. I should have covered about 3-4 miles by then, the road started to become bumpy. I slowed the car as I don't want a flat tire at this time of the night. My phone buzzed once - Sarah‚Äôs name - I picked up, heard her ‚Äúhello‚Äù but before I could respond, the call got disconnected as the screen went black. Dead.

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù I muttered.

It was right when the road started to get scary, a pale glow flickered past the tree-line ahead after an L-bend. Relief. May be a motel or a gas station. An excitement that I am not lost in this dark after all, which lasted until I hit the gas only for the car to pick up speed for a moment, then coughed, lurched and died beneath me.

‚ÄúHell with it‚Äù.

I locked the doors, stepped into the night and walked toward the light which is my only chance to call for help. The closer I came, the less it looked like safety. No pumps. No neon signs. Just a squat building pressed against a single railway platform.

The building was lit from within. I walked in to see if someone was there to ask for help.¬†

It was a small building. One side had a ticket counter and the door opened to the platform. A portion of the door had a glass pane. There was another window right next to the door. The ticket window was closed shut. There was nobody inside. There was a desk which appeared to be the station master's desk. There were two chairs on the other side. I took a seat.

There was a board on the wall with the names of all the station masters with their service periods since the station was established. A shelf on the side with some files. Some usual stuff on the table ‚Äì a pen holder, a paper weight, an old telephone, few files and a name plaque with station master's name on it. The wall clock on the opposite wall showed 11:45 PM. The room had a washroom attached to it.

The desk had a glass slab with coffee ring stains on it. Beneath the glass, there was a sheet of paper with handwritten text. I went to the other side of the table to look at it. The paper looked pale and old. The title read ""Rules to follow to spend the night at the station"" followed by 8 rules. Someone had crossed the word 'spend' and written 'survive'.¬†

I lifted the slab, took the rules sheet and went through the rules.

1. Do not step outside the station building between 12 AM to 6 AM.

2. Do not ask questions to the station master.¬†

3. If you notice someone standing on the platform between 12:30 AM to 1 AM. Do not engage them or try to approach them.

4. You may hear things in familiar voices. They are not the familiar ones nor real.

5. If the phone rings at 1:40 AM, pick up. A woman‚Äôs voice on the other end will say, ""My son hasn‚Äôt arrived home yet. He is usually home by this time"", reply exactly: ""The train is delayed tonight"" and not a word more.

6. If you see severely injured people lying on the tracks, do not go out to help. They are not human.

7. A train will pass at 03:15 AM. If the train stops and people disembark, do not make eye contact with any passenger.

8. Record the events in the register with time.

At least a gag at the end of a long day. I smiled sitting comfortably on the station master's chair. ‚ÄúSomeone has a good sense of humor‚Äù. I lifted the telephone receiver; the line was dead. Whoever ran the place must have stepped out or been late to their shift. I decided to wait inside as the night was getting colder. I rose from the chair to close the door as the clock struck twelve. The door clicked shut on its own.¬†

I flinched, remembering Rule no. 1. Then shook it off. Must be the wind. But my mind was reluctant to not linger around the rules. What if I step out of the station? Why should the station master not be questioned? How does a dead landline ring? What if the rules are not a gag? Am I losing my mind? ‚ÄúLet me take a quick nap‚Äù, I muttered. I put my legs on the desk and leaned back. That is when I saw something from the window which chilled my spine the very moment.

Away from the dim light of the building, I was able to faintly notice the silhouette of someone walking towards the platform bench. My eyes looked at the wall clock, it was 12:35 AM. I sat my shivering legs down, as the silhouette kept moving forward. I noticed a white bridal gown, a veil and gloves in white. She was holding a small bouquet of black roses on her left hand. She stopped walking and stood facing the train tracks.

I was not able to believe my eyes. I stood up, walked nervously to get water and gulped it. My mind is not pacified even to a little bit when I tried to consider the possibility of her being a real girl. I looked at the door, I‚Äôm never gonna dare breaking rule 1. I mustered enough courage only to walk to the window again; she stood motionless facing the tracks. Her silence and stillness were eerily disturbing. As I was assessing the situation, she turned her head and faced me with a straight face. That was enough for me to sit right down on the floor to escape her gaze.

Like pulling the legs into the blanket to save oneself from demons under the bed, I expected that corner of the building to protect me, but this is no time for reasoning. I heard a mild lullaby like hum from the outside. I felt the sound of the hum to steadily increase. I can't accept the fact that it‚Äôs an indication of 'it' moving towards me. Time crawled. The clock hands seemed glued to 12:55 AM. 5 more minutes I said to myself.

My mind had completely given in to the rules when I realized why the word 'spend' on the rule sheet was struck out to be written as survive, as the hum grew louder. The hum stopped abruptly. A voice softly called, ""Matthew... look who's come to visit you"". I was sweating profusely through my skin, at the corner of the room, on the floor. I did not dare to move a muscle, but my curiosity made me look at the glass of the framed portrait on the wall where I saw the reflection of the face of what stood just behind me outside the window. The face of a woman under a thin net veil with mouth and eyes creepily open. Me trying to cheat my mind about my imaginary haven at that corner did not hold any longer as I understood I was merely a wall-away from the abomination. There is nothing more I could do other than closing my eyes, but at the same time I was scared to do so. I took another peek, this time at the clock. The time has finally struck one. I looked at the portrait again. The reflection was gone.¬†

Visually confirming nothing is out there anymore, I composed myself, ‚ÄúLosing my mind is the worst thing I could do to me now. The rules are not to scare but they are directions to survive in this hell of a building‚Äù, I said myself as I washed up my face and looked into the washroom mirror. ‚ÄúIt's just one night, but it's the night where I couldn't afford any mistakes. I‚Äôm gonna be very stringent about the rules‚Äù. I went through the files and registers on the table. One of the registers had events of night logged between 12 AM to 6 PM. The most recent entry was 7 months ago. I marked the date on a fresh page of the register. Made my first entry. 12:35 AM ‚Äì A woman in white bridal gown and a black rose bouquet spotted waiting on platform.

The time was 1:20 AM. I sat on the chair opposite the station master's chair next to the landline. According to rule 5, the phone will ring in 20 minutes. All I had to do was to say a single sentence. I rehearsed it like a prayer. ""The train is delayed tonight"". I was preparing myself for the phone call. It was exactly 1:40 AM. I could hear my heartbeat. The phone rang. I forced my shivering hand to pick the phone. There was sobbing on the other side. I sensed something weirdly familiar. The voice said, ""My son‚Ä¶ My son said he will return home by 11:45 pm. He hasn't come yet."" Ice shot down my spine. Words refused to leave my lips. It was my mother's voice.

I was petrified and confused at the same time. I was prepared to attend the call as per the rule, but I did not prepare to expect my mother's voice. The voice continued, ""hello, did the train arrive on time. hello? hello?"" sobbing. I felt the unreal urge to respond, ""Mom It‚Äôs me"". I told myself, ""Not my real mom. Not real"". I crushed down the lump in my throat, ""The train is delayed tonight"". The line went dead again.

First, my name, now my mother's voice. ‚ÄúHow did this place know that I was about to go to her place, down to the exact time‚Äù. I steadied my breathing. 4 more hours to survive. I logged the event.

I had my head rested on the desk replaying the night‚Äôs events.

That moment, as soon as I heard the door squealed open and slammed shut, I felt a jolt of anguish. I was not sure if my mind was ready to consume what my eyes were about to feed me. Polished shoes. Black pants. *Station master*.

A flicker of relief. Finally a human presence. But nothing tonight had been safe. Hope itself could be a bait.

He sat on the chair opposite to me. I lifted my head to steal a glance only to notice that he had been staring at me all along eyes fixed and unblinking. My eyes naturally lowered down. My bones shivered. His short white beard and mustache sharpened those eyes, which pierced straight through me.

Questions swarmed my head.

*‚Äú*Is he human?‚Äù He is inside, unlike the wraith that couldn‚Äôt cross the threshold. Just an old man with sharp eyes, I told myself. ‚ÄúMen of authority don‚Äôt like to be questioned.‚Äù

""Who are you?"" he asked in a slow-paced gravelly voice.

I did not need Rule no. 2 to restrain me; his stare did.

His eyes drifted to the register I had been writing in, For a moment, I felt safer under the weight of his gaze elsewhere.

I replied after a pause, ‚ÄúMatthew Fernsby‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my station?‚Äù he asked, browsing through the register, his voice scraping like iron.

The silence pressed on me until I muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt want to be outside. It felt unsafe‚Äù

‚ÄúUnsafe from?‚Äù The question stung. Wasn‚Äôt it obvious?

‚ÄúSomething unholy, undead lurking outside‚Äù I forced the words out.

He smirked.

Suddenly, a black bird flew into the room with a shrill squawk which sounded like death itself and landed hard on the desk. My heart almost stopped. Its beak clutched something small, dangling by strings. When it dropped the object, I realized it was a marionette no longer than my palm, its strings trailing like veins. The master didn‚Äôt flinch; the bird flew to his shoulder as though summoned.

While I was trying to understand how the bird could have entered the building, he stood up to leave. That is when I noticed something that slapped the life out of my face.

The name on his badge read ‚ÄúArthur Gruger‚Äù. It is not the name on the plaque on the desk. My brain redirected my eyes to the service board on the wall. My breath froze in my throat when I read ‚ÄòArthur Gruger - 1952 to 1964 (Died in service)‚Äô.

My body clenched my soul as Arthur leaned forward with the black bird tilting its head at me from his shoulder.

‚ÄúThis place has a way to bring things that you dread the most and sometimes things that you want the most. Sometimes they are the same thing‚Äù he said in a low rasp and walked away his silhouette cutting into the dark.

I held my breath as it might slip from my body for good. Did I just have a conversation with a dead man?

If Arthur could enter and exit the building as he wishes, what stopped the wraith before. I am confused. Questions stacked in my mind.

I looked at the marionette. I tried to relate it to Arthur‚Äôs words. But their meaning slipped away.

The marionette was instigating an inexplicable fear in my mind. I couldn‚Äôt bear the sight of it in front of my eyes. I slightly opened the window, grabbed it quick and threw it outside.

Hours ago, I had the most beautiful time of my life. Now, I am in this forsaken place. Is this even a real station? I wish I could fast forward tonight to sunrise or rewind to not have taken this route.

If people who die with unfulfilled wishes haunt the places of their death, no wonder railway tracks are as haunted as graveyards.

I felt it before I heard it. A heaviness crept into the room. Then the sound came. Not a cry. Not a scream. Something worse. Ragged, wet inhalations, as if someone were trying to drag air straight into their lungs and failing. The suspense of not knowing pressed louder than silence. I forced my neck to turn in the direction of window, and I regretted it immediately as I stumbled to the washroom to throw up.

This place had reached into my mind and clawed out the one thing I had buried deepest.

On the tracks, a human torso, no legs, just crushed flesh clawed forward, gasping. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt real,‚Äù I whispered, but the words did nothing.

The sound of strained breathing became a muffled plea. ‚ÄúWater‚Ä¶ thirsty‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶‚Äù The man‚Äôs arm lifted toward me, trembling. In his palm glinted a diamond tennis bracelet. He slipped it from his grasp begging for water in exchange for the bracelet. ‚ÄúWater‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶‚Äù

Years ago, on a roadside, I stood looking at another broken body. Same mangled torso, same rasping thirst. I had called emergency services and waited clutched my water bottle in sweating hands, refusing to give him water because I did not want to speed his death at my hands. I watched him choke on air until the ambulance arrived. Therapy, time, denial and I thought I had buried that night. And now this place had staged the memory perfectly, down to the hand, the plea, the bracelet.

As I almost turned back, a train thundered, headlights flaring running over the torso into pulp in an instant and greased it to the tracks. When the train was gone, the tracks were clean, empty, as if nothing had ever existed.

The voice that said ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù echoed in my head for a while. There is nothing more scarring than looking at someone in their last moments and not be able to do anything. The things I must endure to survive this place.¬†I logged the event.

It was 3:30 AM. I heard a train siren at distance. ""Impossible‚Äù. As per the rules, there is a single train passing at 3:15 AM and that train has already passed. I got a doubt if that was the real train or if this is. What was even scarier was that the train sounded like it was slowing down.¬†

""Rule no. 7. If the train stops and people disembark, do not make eye contact with any passenger."" But what's confusing is the time of the passage. I sat down facing the wall. The slowing train has stopped. I was keenly observing with my ears if people are disembarking the train. I noticed from my peripheral view, that it was not many, but one door had opened, and one person had gotten down. I smelled something good. But that scent was not pleasant to my mind, instead it unsettled me, crawling under my skin. My mind begged for it not to be what I feared it was.¬†

""Matty. What are you doing here? Thank goodness, I thought I will be alone"" Sarah, my girlfriend stood outside the building with the flowers and the chocolates.

She rattled the door. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs locked. Open up, I‚Äôm freezing out here.‚Äù

Emotions overwhelmed me. Sorrow and horror choked me. But I resuscitated my senses in a short time.¬†

Unclenched from my position I asked, ""Who are you?"".

""Are you fuckin‚Äô with me?"" she asked infuriated.

""I repeat who are you?"" I asked in the same tone.

Her voice showed she was enraged, I was able to recognize that.

""Sarah, your girlfriend, remember?"" The events of that night had already made me immune to such provocations.

‚ÄúNo, you are not. I had boarded the real Sarah on her train earlier tonight‚Äù, I replied without hesitation.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean real Sarah? Have you gone crazy? Have you lost your mind? Again?‚Äù

I did not respond.

She pressed on, ‚ÄúIt was me whom you boarded the train. The wrong train. My actual train was cancelled. I got down at the next station.‚Äù

I recalled the announcement that the train will be delayed by at least 30 minutes but there was a train on time. It is possible that she boarded the wrong train. I‚Äôm in a situation again. If what she says is true, I am putting her life through risk.

¬†‚ÄúBut why did you choose to come here instead of going back to your-...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBECAUSE THIS STATION HAS A TRANSFER TO MY PLACE.‚Äù She yelled at the top of her lungs before I even completed my sentence.

‚ÄúI am talking to you, what are you staring at?‚Äù Sarah snapped, her fists tight around the bouquet.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not -‚Äù she stopped me halfway.

‚ÄúYes, you are. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, Matthew. I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt. I am so tired of explaining myself, over and over, just to crawl back into this‚Ä¶ this toxic thing we keep calling a relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúSarah ‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! Stop. You always want me to defend myself, answer your questions like I‚Äôm on trial. I‚Äôm freezing out here, and I don‚Äôt owe you anything.‚Äù She hurled the flowers and chocolates to the ground, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúIt was my mistake to even take these stupid apologies and pretend they meant something.‚Äù

My head spun.¬†I can‚Äôt wrong her again. I was thinking of how to make her understand what is really happening here. ‚ÄúBut what if‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. Stop it. Let me think‚Äù I suppressed my inner voice.

I was wavering between denial and acceptance.

I started, ‚ÄúSarah, please do one‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOpen the damn door‚Äù She kicked the door.

‚ÄúListen to me, one last time. I will try to make you understand the situation the best I could. You don‚Äôt know what happened through the night and what has brought me to this station. If I told you tonight, I received a phone call on a dead landline, If I told you tonight, I met a man who died decades ago. If I told you, tonight I had to follow a set of rules to survive till the very moment. Will you be able to believe me? But all that is true. Please do one last thing. For me, For us. Please.‚Äù

She replied with silence. That was good enough for me.

‚ÄúStand by the window positioning yourself against the portrait on the wall‚Äù

She walked to the window and stood against the portrait.

I shut my eyes. Turned to the portrait. I held my breath as much as my lungs could. Then I opened them.

Sarah. The reflection was hers. Not twisted. Not hollow. Just hers. My knees almost buckled. I laughed under my breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really you.‚Äù

I turned to her, heart unclenching for the first time that night‚Ä¶ then froze.

I witnessed a smile that stretched wider than a human mouth would. Too wide. Too still. Too cold. Too demonic. ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù my mouth enunciated.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt flatter yourself‚Äù she locked her eyes against mine.

The frozen smile on Sarah's face grew creepier with silence. I couldn't take my eyes away from her, even when I tried to. I felt paralyzed. ‚ÄúI fell for it, I broke the rule. She is not Sarah"".

My body moved, but it wasn‚Äôt mine anymore. I clawed at the desk, nails scraping, but my grip slid uselessly. My legs carried me towards the door as if pulled by strings. My heels dragged, rubber squealing against the floor, yet my body leaned forward like a puppet hauled up by unseen wires.

The door was unlatched by my own hand. Cold night air burst across my face.

She was waiting. Her smile stretched too wide. Her hand caught mine.

The cold burned. Not the chill of night, but something that sank into my bones, into marrow, into my throat until I gagged on it. I tried to wrench free, but her fingers were iron hooks locked around me. My legs walked to her rhythm past the flower basket and box of chocolate next to the marionette I threw out.

‚ÄúSometimes they are the same thing‚Äù I heard Arthur‚Äôs words echoing.

The train was there. Its whistle split my skull. A blast of air that reeked of rot pressed against me. Faces stared from its windows‚Ä¶ hundreds of them, mouths slack, eyes glittering like knives in the dark.

I dug my heels into the platform, every muscle shrieking. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶‚Äù The words broke in my throat.

The doors yawned open. The heat and stench hit me like a wall. Those eyes. A thousand of them, gleaming with hunger.

I fell forward into them, dragged into the black belly of the train as it sped its way into infinite darkness.",3,1759640583.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1nyfdvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/altprog/comments/1nyfdvb/meaning_of_human_civilization/,meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

Have you ever noticed that when you listen to *luck subliminals* or say *luck affirmations*, you start getting small things ‚Äî like free food, random compliments, or little favors ‚Äî but not the **big breakthroughs** you actually want?

That‚Äôs not because your subliminals aren‚Äôt working.  
It‚Äôs because of something called **normalization** ‚Äî one of the most underrated subconscious mechanics in manifestation.

# üîç What ‚ÄúNormalization‚Äù Really Means

Your subconscious mind doesn‚Äôt judge what‚Äôs *big* or *small* luck ‚Äî it simply repeats what it already recognizes as **normal for you**.

If, in your internal world, ‚Äúbeing lucky‚Äù means getting a free coffee or a small favor, then that‚Äôs the level of luck your subconscious will keep producing ‚Äî because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been programmed to expect.

Your *reality always reflects your subconscious definition of normal.*

So if you‚Äôre consistently getting small wins, it just means your subconscious has normalized *small-scale luck* ‚Äî and nothing more.

# üß© How Normalization Shapes Your Results

Think of your subconscious like a thermostat.  
If the thermostat is set to ‚Äúsmall luck,‚Äù that‚Äôs the temperature your life will maintain ‚Äî no matter how many subliminals you listen to or affirmations you repeat.

Even if a big opportunity tries to appear ‚Äî like a high-paying client or a big financial breakthrough ‚Äî your subconscious might block, delay, or downplay it because it doesn‚Äôt fit what it believes is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for you.

That‚Äôs why so many people keep seeing small manifestations instead of big results.  
Their internal ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hasn‚Äôt caught up with the reality they *want.*",1,1759640552.0,SubliminalNation,0,1.0,False

This is about trust, comfort, and connection. I'd like to meet first in a public place (coffee, a walk, etc.) to see if there's a vibe. If you can host eventually, great. If not, we'll figure something out.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Every week after I pay bills I am left with basically $20-30 to last me till next pay day and often let my account go negative $60-70 when I put gas so I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting to work for the week and am very frugal with where I go that I mainly just use my car to get me to and from work so that I don‚Äôt waste gas, I also often ask my best friend if he can spot me (so far he‚Äôs spotted me like $350 in the last couple weeks..) and sometimes I am able to save a bit more money and with that I usually get little things here and there for her like coffee, or I bring food to her on her lunch breaks, I try to do things for her when I can afford it which sadly is very rarely, which really sucks because she does take me on quite a bit of dates and never tells me how much the tab is when I ask and it really makes me sad cause I have only been able to afford taking her on one date so far which I had to save for literally 2ish months for. I never ask my gf for money, and while she knows how much I make an hr and how many hours a week I work (which recently I have been having a bit of health issues that make working where I work more difficult for me and I also haven‚Äôt been able to work over 20 hours a week cause my job has been cutting hours like crazy) I usually keep it to myself how much i actually struggle, until recently. She said ‚ÄúI understand that financially you‚Äôre in a different spot then I am and I enjoy buying you things‚Äù and then went on to say how she would like for me to try more on paying for things ‚Ä¶ which like again I try to get her little things when I can afford it which is not often cause I barely have more then $30 after I get paid especially recently with the amount of hours I am being given and it really hurt me because I genuinely know I wont be able to afford it‚Ä¶ she also pointed out that she helped me with one of my bills recently (I didn‚Äôt ask for any help with it, she offered) and it just felt like it was thrown back in my face when I thought it was just a kind gesture done because she wanted to and now everything has left me feeling a bit sad. I ended up sending her what ever money I had after our talk and she said she would send it back but I her told her no. And after talking again recently I had mentioned that instead of her picking me up I would just meet her places so she‚Äôs not wasting gas to get me and she said she didn‚Äôt care and that she still wants to pick me up and drop me off and I said I would just send her gas money whenever i can afford it then and she said she never wanted to make me feel guilty and that she was sorry, but now I just feel like I‚Äôm already perceived like I‚Äôm just a  user which I‚Äôm really not and why I always kept my financial situation to myself even though she knows how much less I make then her. And after talking with my bestfriend he‚Äôs said he would help me in paying her back for things, and we agreed that I can just pay him back later whenever I am able to and I‚Äôve also expressed to him that I plan to just decline anything that has to do with her spending money on me in the future and he agreed that maybe that might be best. I know she probably won‚Äôt take me sending money back for everything well, but I am just uncomfortable now and really unsure where to go from here? ",1,1759639736.0,wlwadvice,0,1.0,False

This is going to be sooo boring.‚Äù X, trying to keep his smile, replies, ‚ÄúJust go along with it. She really needs this.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll begin our lesson with the first 10 numbers,‚Äù 37 begins to write, ‚Äú1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-‚Äú 37 is stopped by the peripheral sight of X raising his hands up and down, a grin of knowing annoyingness on his face.

‚ÄúOh, god no, just really only 67.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy are they so fixated on 67? Sure, it‚Äôs a super-prime like 5 or 211, a Chen prime like 19 or 71, a lucky prime like 7 or 223.‚Äù 37 proceeds to continue expanding on the reasons why 67 could be considered unique, ‚ÄúBut I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs any more unique than 6 or 7, or 61, or 37, or 17-‚Äú X quickly interrupts 37 to stop her from continuing to list out numbers, ‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why 67 is popular. You see, there was a kid who-‚Äú 37 suddenly steps toward X, somehow towering over him as he bends back, ‚ÄúNo! Nothing matters about numbers more than their essence!

### Odds & Implied Probabilities

* **Ankalaev** (-280, decimal: 1.36 ‚Üí **73.5% implied**) is the brick wall with a title. His 12-0-1 streak since 2018? That‚Äôs 13 fights without a loss. His last win over Pereira? A 94-76 **significant strike** landslide (including 66 body/head shots to Pereira‚Äôs 28).

### Prop Bets to Note

* **Ankalaev to win by KO/TKO or decision**: -190 (per news context). He‚Äôs never been finished, but his **0-12 takedown success** in their first fight? Let‚Äôs call it ""strate

\- more command hooks in entry way for bags? unsure about layout right now it feels weird

\- a coffee table / small kitchen island for somewhere to eat, but i think this would require also moving the couch. i've been scared to commit to any larger furniture that might clutter the space so would love suggestions on this

A little about me:  
I‚Äôm introverted, work remotely from home, and like conversations that go a bit beyond ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day.‚Äù Some of my hobbies include basketball (watching and playing), card collecting (sports and some nostalgic stuff), photography (mainly street and travel), hiking, and traveling when I get the chance.

I‚Äôm also into movies - especially romantic comedies - though my favorite might not technically qualify: the *Before Trilogy* (*Before Sunrise*, *Before Sunset*, *Before Midnight*). There‚Äôs just something about the slow burn of dialogue and character growth that really sticks with me.

I enjoy giving advice, playful debates, and a little friendly back-and-forth. I‚Äôm definitely looking for someone who doesn‚Äôt mind a bit of banter and can hold a good conversation without needing to be prodded with questions every time.

**What I‚Äôm hoping for:**  
I‚Äôd really like to connect with someone who enjoys writing **medium to long emails**, who‚Äôs okay with sharing small moments of everyday life, and is up for exchanging the occasional ‚Äúthis is what my day looked like‚Äù photo (nothing fancy - think coffee mugs, a walk outside, a new book, or an unreasonably messy desk). Bonus points if you like to write every couple of days and don‚Äôt let the conversation fade for a week at a time.

I'm not looking for anything romantic - just a steady, friendly exchange with someone who‚Äôs thoughtful, curious, and maybe even a little competitive in a fun way (whether that‚Äôs who takes the better photo or who makes the better random observation about life).

If this sounds like a good fit, feel free to send me a message with a bit about yourself and your interests. Happy to start slow and see where the conversation goes. No pressure, just good vibes and a more interesting inbox.

Looking forward to hearing from you!",1,1759638423.0,penpals,3,1.0,False

I know no family is perfect. My husband (33M) has always been the ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù of his family ‚Äî introverted, quiet, the one who sat on his phone to avoid drama. I (34F) am the opposite. Social butterfly, outgoing, but also do not like drama. When we first met through mutual friends, his mother was thrilled. It honestly felt like a dream. We spent every day together, coffee in the mornings that stretched into afternoons. Since my own mom wasn‚Äôt around in my teenage/adult years, this meant the world to me. She even stood by me when I lost my brother suddenly. I thought I‚Äôd gained a second mom.

But slowly, things started to shift. She had this habit of befriending her sons‚Äô exes and bringing them around, even when they had moved on with new families. It made things very uncomfortable ‚Äî especially since we all lived on the same 5 acres. When we politely explained how it felt, she dismissed us with ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my house, my rules.‚Äù

I began realizing she thrived on other people‚Äôs drama and didn‚Äôt have close friends of her own. The closer my husband and I got to moving off the property and creating our own space, the more tension grew. Holidays were the worst ‚Äî every single one (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, even birthdays) was expected to be at her house. When we tried to split time with my family, she made it clear she wasn‚Äôt okay with it.

After we got engaged, we finally drew a line and said we wanted our own traditions too. Ironically, right after that my sister-in-law told me my MIL had cast a ‚Äúbad karma‚Äù and ‚Äúfreezer spell‚Äù on me. I‚Äôm open-minded and don‚Äôt judge people‚Äôs beliefs, but I was raised in a strong Christian family and it cut deep that she responded to boundaries that way.

Then came pregnancy and parenthood ‚Äî which should have been joyful. She helped plan our gender reveal, only to leak the news before we even knew. When I went into labor early, she drove me to the hospital (my husband was at work). But before I could even call my family, she posted on Facebook that the baby was on the way. It felt like so many boundaries had been crossed.

Eventually, we stopped talking for a year. During that time, she made Facebook posts accusing me of withholding her grandchild, captioning family photos #MissingOne to make me look like the villain.

Now it‚Äôs been three years. My husband is still in touch with one brother, but not the other. The family says they miss us coming around. But the last time I was at her house, she told me I wasn‚Äôt welcome ‚Äî then turned around, took my child into her arms, and carried her into her home like nothing had happened. That was my final straw.

Through it all, my husband has been clear: the toxicity isn‚Äôt okay, and if it doesn‚Äôt stop, he‚Äôs willing to walk away completely. He tells me I‚Äôm his world, that he couldn‚Äôt imagine life without me and our two kids. He even jokes with me about it, saying, ‚ÄúMy mom is not a nice lady.‚Äù

And yet‚Ä¶I still feel guilty. I feel like a bad wife for not ‚Äúfixing‚Äù things before more time passes. I want my husband to have his family too, without the drama, and I want to set a healthy example for our children. But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible.

Has anyone else gone through this? Is it worth trying to repair, or do I accept being the black sheep and just build a relationship with his siblings instead?",2,1759638243.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I‚Äôm hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who‚Äôs up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations‚Äîwhether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I‚Äôm here for it.

About me: I‚Äôm known to be fun, especially if you‚Äôre the calm and fun type too. I‚Äôm well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit‚ÄîI run a lot. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors‚Äîhiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you‚Äôre respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1759638180.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1nyenrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1nyenrn/30_m4f_mumbai_cats_naryal_pani_escape_from_the/,"30 [M4F] Mumbai - Cats, Naryal Pani & Escape From The Tyranny Of Coffee Table Dates!","Here is a thought I can't seem to shake. The whole modern process of meeting someone feels a bit like a job interview for a position you're not even sure you want. There‚Äôs the pre-interview screening, which is the texting, and then there's the formal sit-down across a table under lights that are always too bright, where you both present optimized, slightly fictionalized versions of yourselves. It‚Äôs a whole production. And the sheer exhaustion of it all, the psychic weight of performing your own personality, makes me want to just stay home and watch documentaries about how bridges are built.

So I have an alternative theory for a first meeting. A kind of anti-interview.

Option A is the Pet Cafe Gambit. Think about the strategic genius of this. The pressure is immediately diffused. It‚Äôs not just you and me, locked in a conversational tractor beam. It‚Äôs you, me, and a dozen or so creatures whose entire life philosophy is to find a sunbeam and sleep in it. There can be no awkward silences, because we can just turn our attention to a puppy trying to figure out a chew toy or a cat that has decided your bag is its new ancestral home. The social burden is shared with the animals. We can talk about them. We can have a perfectly good time without ever having to ask the dreaded, ""So, what do you do?"" question until at least the second cup of coffee. It‚Äôs a buffer. A very cute, furry buffer against social anxiety.

Option B is the Juhu Beach Meander. This is a different but equally valid approach. Here, the pressure is relieved not by animals, but by motion and chaos. We wouldn't be sitting face to face, which is a fundamentally confrontational posture. We would be walking side by side, looking at the same things. The weirdly competitive kite flyers, the person selling channa jor garam or the stall selling naryal pani with an almost religious intensity, the horizon which seems both endless and somehow just out of reach. We're not performing for each other, we're just two people observing the general, magnificent absurdity of a Mumbai evening. The conversation can come and go. It doesn't have to be a constant stream. We can just walk, and breathe in the salty air, and maybe have a shared opinion about the quality of the sand.

A little about the person writing this: I read books, sometimes finishing them. I listen to podcasts that are probably too long. My attempts at DIY home repair usually end with me having three extra screws, a slightly more broken appliance, and a deep philosophical respect for people who actually know how to use a wrench. I think I'm a decent person with a healthy appreciation for the ridiculous.

If any of this rambling resonates with the part of your brain that is also a bit tired of the usual script, send a message. We can see if we're on the same page, or at least in the same chapter.",1,1759638153.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1nyen53,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1nyen53/38m_east_coaster_seeking_a_witty_female_penpal/,"[38/M] East Coaster Seeking a Witty Female Penpal for Banter, Life Chats, and a Little Inbox Joy","Hey There!  I'm looking to connect with a like-minded penpal - ideally someone witty, thoughtful, and up for regular email exchanges that go beyond surface-level chit-chat.

I work remotely from home and, as an introvert, I genuinely enjoy slower, meaningful conversations over the rush of constant notifications. That said, there‚Äôs still something oddly satisfying about seeing a new email pop into my inbox - especially when it‚Äôs not spam or a promo code email. 

A few things about me:

* I‚Äôm a big fan of **basketball**, both watching and shooting around when I can.
* I collect **trading cards** (mainly sports and baseball specifically, a little nostalgia thrown in with some old-school Pok√©mon).
* I dabble in **photography**, (the kind where I actually use a camera, not just my phone).
* I love **hiking** and **traveling**, especially to places that gives me a chance to unplug from the world
* I unapologetically enjoy **rom coms** \- but my favorite is the *Before Trilogy*, which isn‚Äôt quite a comedy but hits me in all the right emotional spots. The dialogue, the natural chemistry, the character growth across the years... I could go on. (And I probably will if you ask.)

Personality-wise, I‚Äôm a good listener, a bit introspective, and I like giving advice when asked (or occasionally when not, but I try to rein that in). I enjoy a back-and-forth filled with a bit of banter -something that feels effortless but has substance.  I am described as laid back, easy to get along with, flirty (at times), dependable, and competitive when it comes to games

**Who I'm looking to connect with:**

I'm hoping to find a **female penpal**, preferably someone 30+, who:

* Has a sharp sense of humor and enjoys playful back-and-forths
* Writes **medium to long emails** with some thought behind them - not a novel, but more than a few lines
* Is consistent -  ideally someone who writes **every other day** or close to it. Not looking for penpals who disappear for weeks at a time
* Enjoys a bit of **healthy competition** \- games, debates, photo challenges, or ‚Äúwho had the weirder day‚Äù stories
* Doesn‚Äôt mind **sharing casual, day-in-the-life photos** (think: desk views, pets, coffee mugs, random clouds - not selfies unless you want to)

Not looking for romance, just a genuine, thoughtful, and fun penpal experience. If you're the kind of person who enjoys building a friendship through consistent and thoughtful communication, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

If you‚Äôre interested, shoot me a DM with a little about yourself - bonus points if you mention your favorite romcom or a movie that‚Äôs all talk but still somehow captivating.",2,1759638099.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

2. My observation : It's not like nagpur ke people don't DATE or MEET or get involved in Casual shit but the approach is via LET'S BE FRIENDS AND ACT AS IF I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH YOU ü§£ like just be honest 

3.  CONVERSATION SKILLS are a fantasy : what i have seen is women do look at me and honestly they just keep staring at times but would never talk like it feels so awkward here like if you wanna speak to me just talk if don't toh stop looking at me
