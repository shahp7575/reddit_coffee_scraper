I‚Äôve been seeing this girl for a few weeks. Things moved fast ‚Äî we really hit it off. We texted every day, met a couple of times, had great conversations, kissed, and there was genuine chemistry. I felt like we were both enjoying getting to know each other.

A few days ago, she told me she needed space. She recently got out of a relationship that left her emotionally shaken, and she realized she‚Äôs not in the right mindset to keep talking or seeing someone regularly. She said she had a great time with me, that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúten out of ten guy‚Äù, and that it wasn‚Äôt about me ‚Äî she just needs time to reset. She even said she hopes that in the future we might reconnect.

I told her I understood and respected her decision. I didn‚Äôt want to pressure her, and I closed the conversation with maturity and good energy.

That said, I really like her ‚Äî not in a desperate way, but because I genuinely felt something worth exploring. I‚Äôd love to stay in touch or even just meet up again casually, no pressure, no expectations. I feel like what we had deserves a chance to breathe, not just be cut off completely.

I was thinking of texting her in a few days saying I was left with the feeling that I wish we had spoken in person, and that if she‚Äôs open to it, I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee or something simple to talk calmly.

What would you advise? Should I send that message or just leave it alone completely? Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it go?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Bedtime was 7:10pm based on cues, rubbing eyes and yawning.

Got in Saturday in the midst of a fully booked and somewhat chaotic scene due to the Keeneland horse races. As we know, the weekend crowd differs a bit from the in-week business traveler. As such, no upgrades or better  were available and I had to fight for a ‚Äúhigher room‚Äù on floor 11. Sometimes I wish they would just give it to me without the hassle. 

This is a 12 story hotel and shares a front check in parking lot area with an attached Residence Inn. Check in for the hotels themselves is separate. There is a restaurant at Residence Inn, roof level. I didn‚Äôt try it due to poor reviews and there are quite a lot of good restaurants in the area that are easily walkable. 

Self park is available for 22 and valet for 32. 

Hospitality at the hotel is good. I felt the reception folks sincerely tried to get me into a room type that worked for me. As they were fully booked I initially was given two queens with a tub. I don‚Äôt care for tub showers and this one was more rectangular and quite high to step into. I was moved into a king with stand up shower room on Sunday after some guests had cleared out. While I did appreciate that, I do know some larger rooms were available and not sure why I wasn‚Äôt upgraded to it. It sat empty my whole time. 

At any rate, the rooms themselves are pretty, nice decor. Calming colors. Bathroom has good lighting for the ladies. The shower didn‚Äôt have the small shelf to shave legs. Drain in the sink was really really slow. Alarm clock had a number that didn‚Äôt fully light up. Bed was ok, not the worse or best. Small things like that catch attention and should be addressed before guests are allowed in. 

My first room faced away from the Residence Inn and was a perfunctory small city view. Second room faced RI and it was not a pretty view despite being on 11. 

As I didn‚Äôt get top floor, I could hear the person above me walking around, especially past midnight. Super annoying. I could also hear the person in the room next to me as he was kind of loud. These are things I really look out for in hotels. I do use white noise. It still could hear footsteps and people arojnd. 

Hotel does have a first floor M Lounge and it was actually open all weekend. That was a nice touch as I‚Äôve found many lounges close for the weekend. Food was just  ok, I can tell they care. The way the food is held in the warmer containers created a lot of water in them as it dripped from the lid into the food. Lots of accidental soggy offerings as such. They have Nespresso coffee machine that is predictably finicky. Decent selection of juice and snacks all day long as well. Diana is one of the lounge managers and very hospitable. 

Also kudos to Sherman, Diane and Nicole for making the stay pleasant. This is a decent hotel for those who have business or pleasure in Lexington. Close to airport and easy to get to. Overall 6.5",0,1744913112.0,marriott,0,0.5,False

my family would sell things at a farmer's market and outdoor flea market in jersey. bored, i'd venture around. found myself in front of an old man with a small table in front of him doing card tricks. he had the whole outfit.

slick hair. suit. and a command of any small audience of passerbys.

no idea why he took me under his wing. maybe because i stuck around when everybody else moved on. the crowd dispersed, he leans forward, ""wanna see something?""

so he performs an effect then says to come around the back of the table next to him. he does it all again, except without the spiel. only performing, and as he does he shows me how it's done. 

so for maybe two years or so, every weekend, i was by his side as he performed and then every so often glanced at me to ensure i saw how it was done. we talked of course. he gave me resources, watched me practice. i got a discount at a local magic shop because of him. cool guy.

the real magic wasn't the tricks. that was only a setup. the magic was in the connection between people. the openness. guards down. in the moment. that sorta thing. chills, actually.

bringing folks into the moment. that's what it was all about. and the magician prepares themselves through practice, routine after routine, performance after performance.

for a glimpse. 

the lead in to this was thinking about being available at times to folks curious enough on reddit. only available to however it unfolds.

then they get a glimpse. sitting sideline to this is...i mean, nothing compares to it honestly.

only once is enough.

i may be exaggerating. no kids of my own. but i *might* compare it to a mother being home alone with her baby as they take their first steps. or a father. or sister, brother, whatever, point is: watching that first entry into a whole new world of possibility.

there's a push to get it right, as far as sharing conceptual understanding. part of the process apparently. but to simply be available to it all as it happens...what a gift.

Some users suggested that I measure the temperature of the water coming out of the grouphead, so I did just that, with no coffee, puck or portafilter installed.

  
I used a mug that had been pre-heated. I tested over 3 days on 3 occasions. Each time I waited for an hour for the machine to fully warm up, flushed some water, waited a couple minutes, then ran the test.

  
The probe reads about 120F when water is poured from the grouphead without a portafilter placed in. I tested my main water in the same mug (my water heater is set to 120F), and I was able to read about 120F in the mug. I also tested the water coming out of the hot water of the Bianca, and that read close to 170F.

  
The machine is currently set at 200F, and the boiler temperature was reading either 199 or 200F when performing the test.

We‚Äôre June and Vi, two friends in their early 30s, looking to make new friends. This post is coming out of a conversation at a train station caf√©, talking about wanting to find people who fit where we are, realizing that after certain life-changing events, the other friends in our lives aren‚Äôt the perfect fits they used to be. If you can relate to that, please tell us how and reach out!

**June**: Hello future friend! I work in healthcare, with a professional fluency in banter. If I‚Äôm not binge watching a series, I‚Äôm usually traveling. I‚Äôm either eating my way through different countries or visiting my loved ones on the East Coast where I used to live. Simple pleasures in life for me: being on the lookout for the best Vietnamese coffee spots, seeing live music at small venues of my favorite indie artists and finding trails/lakes to run around. I‚Äôm an extrovert who enjoys meeting all types of people from different walks of life. I am too much of a homebody like my cat Mittens so I am looking forward to building community and hobbies for myself locally.

**Vi**: Cheers! I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0‚Äù, pansexual, sarcastic, ambiguously southeast Asian, and writing and communication are fields I‚Äôm proud of. Most of my time is spent in law, technology, or listening to people spill tea. My Google Maps food map is always in need of recommendations and I‚Äôm happy to share! I‚Äôm trying to neglect my 60 plants less, spend more time with my cat, and make it through the books on my coffee table. I go on walks with June when we‚Äôre free, tennis at night with other friends, building community at a mahjong den in Oakland, have a horrible taste in music (please send me your taste), enjoy writing when I can, making postcards, and being the ambivert that listens and enables productive discussion about being human.

Here are our intros, and if you‚Äôre interested in meeting us, **send a blurb over**! Ideally, you're in or near the near the Castro Valley / Union City area, 25-35, and have a lived life behind you that you're secure in yappin' about. June's back in town for a few days, then traveling again, so we‚Äôll definitely take our time with reading responses, chatting with people, and setting up engagements to get boba, brunch, or chat over We‚Äôre Not Really Strangers. Looking forward to hearing from you!

**Important:**

* Please don't message us for sex, we're not looking for that at all. We would love to find platonic besties figuring out life.
* For a blurb, send something over like above.

She has always been a very anxious person I guess you could say but from the beginning of our relationship I began to notice that things would affect her greatly in an emotional sense.  Not just things that you would expect for that reaction but even small what others may consider insignificant things. 

I guess it started when we moved in together and she began to complain about my ‚Äúenergy‚Äù. I would wake up some mornings and be in a perfectly fine mood but she would look at me and ask me if I was mad at her. And I wasn‚Äôt there was nothing to be mad about I was just drinking coffee.  Then she would say I was being too intense and the coffee made me that way and it would evolve into this 3 hour discussion where I tried to explain to her that I was not feeling that way at all but it was like she couldn‚Äôt hear me.  She would say that I made her feel a certain way so even if I didn‚Äôt mean it I should apologize.  Which left me stressed and perplexed.

This turned into getting upset if I left the bed before she woke up in the morning or she would disassociate if we watched tv and would get mad saying that we were having any quality time together. And the tv was he idea and this was after a day of talking and spending the whole day together.

If I was upset about work she would get upset because she would say my energy was affecting her energy to the point I felt I could never have a bad or difficult day.

She would go from really happy to crying in the course of a couple minutes and storm out of the house.  She would say I was the best person one minute and then question my lifestyle choices and the fact I have no friends after that.

She has threatened to kill herself a few times as well but that‚Äôs usually when she‚Äôs been drinking which is a lot.  I have another post about that in a different group.

I just feel exhausted all the time and never know what‚Äôs going to happen from one day to the next.  Does any of this sound familiar?There‚Äôs plenty more but this post is already getting too long ",2,1744912387.0,BPDlovedones,4,1.0,False

Professor commences hunger strike for Rumeysa √ñzt√ºrk after conflicts with BU signage policy
April 17, 2025 12:14 am  by 
By Lauren Albano

A Boston University earth and environment professor began a hunger strike Tuesday afternoon after signage reading ‚ÄúFree Rumeysa‚Äù was removed from his office window for the second time.

Around 1 p.m. Tuesday, Nathan Phillips discovered his ‚ÄúFree Rumeysa‚Äù sign was removed from his office window. He commenced a hunger strike that afternoon, which he said will last until federal authorities free university students who were detained for participating in pro-Palestine campus protests.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm offering this sacrifice as an expression of love and solidarity with Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa √ñzt√ºrk and Mohsen Mahdawi, and other community members even at BU who have had their right to freedom of speech, freedom of movement, due process and to be treated with humanity and decency, removed from them,‚Äù Phillips said.

As part of the hunger strike, Phillips said he will refrain from consuming any solid or liquid calories, with the exception of unsweetened black coffee and tea and vitamin supplements.

Phillips has engaged in two extended hunger strikes before. 

The first was a solo hunger strike in 2020 protesting a compressor station in Northern Weymouth, Mass., and the second was a group hunger strike in 2022 following the sighting of a power plant in Peabody, Mass.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take it lightly, and it‚Äôs not something I encourage others to do or think about because there are health implications for doing such an action,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúI have only done it when it‚Äôs a matter of principle, that is of what I consider to be of critical importance, and this is one.‚Äù

Phillips said he had a meeting with the College of Arts and Sciences Dean April 10 regarding a previous incident in which signage reading ‚ÄúFree Mahmoud,‚Äù referencing the detainment of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, was removed from his office window without his knowledge.

At the meeting, Phillips said he referenced a Dean of Students policy on signage. He said on April 12 he discovered that the policy was no longer listed under DOS, but as a University-wide policy. 

BU Spokesperson Colin Riley deferred to a letter sent to the University community Sept. 17, 2024, by BU President Melissa Gilliam that announced an updated Events and Demonstrations Policy. Subsection Di under Section I, ‚ÄúUse of University Spaces,‚Äù focuses on signage.

‚ÄúAny signage used by Event participants may not be affixed to any University-owned property, including walls, windows, or furniture,‚Äù the policy reads.

In the letter, Gilliam wrote the updated Events and Demonstrations Policy acknowledges that free expression is ‚Äúcrucial to our education mission,‚Äù but it ‚Äúsets forth time, place, and manner guidelines‚Äù to avoid unreasonable interference with University operations.

Sadiq Reza, a lecturer at the BU School of Law, confirmed the University moved its signage policy from the DOS section, which governs student conduct, to a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù university section that covers every building and every member of the University community, not just students.

The policy ‚Äúretroactively governs‚Äù Phillips‚Äô practice of putting signs in his window, Reza said. 

‚ÄúIt seems to me, a tacit acknowledgment that the policy did not cover faculty members at the time that Professor Phillips‚Äô signs were removed,‚Äù Reza said. 

Phillips is communicating with the BU chapter of the American Association of University Professors regarding the updated policy. 

BU AAUP President Mary Battenfeld said she believes the change in policy could be directed at Phillips.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure on what grounds BU is using to remove these, [but] I also feel like it seems to be targeted toward one particular faculty member,‚Äù Battenfeld said. ‚ÄúTargeted application of rules always comes from a place of bias.‚Äù

Phillips cited the 1986 case of Abramowitz v. Boston University ‚Äî in which a BU student successfully sued the University for the right to post anti-apartheid signs in their dormitory windows ‚Äî as his inspiration for putting political signage in his office window.

Reza said the basis of the Abramowitz decision was that the existing sign policy was enforced selectively, and the principle of selective enforcement applies to faculty-placed signage.

‚ÄúSelective enforcement of policies is unacceptable and reflects viewpoint discrimination,‚Äù Reza said.

Phillips put a note in his office stating he would commence the hunger strike if any personnel removed the new sign from his window. He said while he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsend idle threats‚Äù to the University, he wanted to inform the administration of the ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù of removing his sign.

‚ÄúThis is about her, Rumeysa √ñzt√ºrk, and the inhumane and brutal and undignified treatment of a human being,‚Äù Phillips said.

Battenfeld commended Phillips for engaging in a hunger strike given the long history of the practice‚Äôs social justice activism.

In her office, she put up her own ‚ÄúFree Rumeysa‚Äù sign in solidarity with not just Phillips, but students as well. 

‚ÄúThis is also affecting our students,‚Äù Battenfeld said. ‚ÄúI have a number of international students who are scared, and so I feel like, in posting something to free Rumeysa, I am also doing my job as a faculty member to take care [of] my students.‚Äù

Phillips said he will continue using his office window to display political messages. He grew up in California and had close friends whose parents were detained in Japanese internment camps during World War II, experiences that inform his activism today.

‚ÄúWhen I see what‚Äôs going on today with lawful permanent residents, essentially being deported, being taken away, disappeared, for expressing speech, there‚Äôs no way I can remain silent about that,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be one of the people who‚Äôs silent.‚Äù",14,1744912283.0,BostonU,0,0.94,False

I very much love my husband. Years ago in about late 2019 my husband and myself discussed being poly, I had a couple poly relationships before. Well a little after we started I found out I was pregnant. I also had a talk with hubby about my wants going into this and that was we date separate but can keep each other in the loop on things we feel comfortable saying. (He likes to know EVERYTHING and I like to build separate relationships and have some privacy where I don't divulge everything) He struggled with this but I also wasn't actively looking because I was pregnant and was very much sick. So came our first hurdle. Dating separately and him being jealous or trying control the narrative on what I did. I allowed and even encouraged him to go out and do whatever he wanted. We shared locations so if something happened we knew where the other was at. That all being said he started dating someone right away and I took my time but I eventually found someone who would just take me for coffee or a short hike. Me and the guy I was seeing didn't work out so I just put everything on hold for myself and my pregnancy. Also while this was happening hubby and myself got married. Hubby had a couple short lives encounters. He always chopped it up to something or another. He always kept pushing to have a shared girlfriend and while I wasn't against it, it wasn't exactly what I wanted while being pregnant. I honestly took a 3 year break from being with anyone because kids are a lot of mentally energy. He kept talking to ladies and the like which I didn't mind. I was talking to men but nothing more than talking which I was fine with. Finally after years with him encouraging me I finally found someone to date! First date he had a lot of jealousy and was pretty controlling about the whole situation. My phone was being BLOWN up with messages from him wanting to know EVERYTHING I was doing and guilt tripping me about being out and fucking the guy on the first date. (Just went with the flow of things and didn't put expectations into play he did) I don't normally fuck on the first date but things weren't awkward. I come home and he's having a full mental breakdown. He says I cheated on him ect.. at this point I'm fed up with him trying to control me and manipulate me and make me feel bad about going out after not for YEARS! We fight basically all night and he is just a wreck and I'm frustrated and just over him trying to manipulate me and make me feel like shit. I am frustrated at this point and I just let him work his shit because I don't know what else to do other than make sure he know I'm not leaving.. ",1,1744912036.0,u_Strict_Garbage_28,0,1.0,False

""‚Ä¶so these enchanted bits of thread and wire basically work like artificial nerves, kinda. Doesn't provide any sensation though, only motor input.""

It had been a few days now since Jules' new arm had been completed- Well. 'completed'.

While he and Ailbhe had finished up the structure and mechanical parts and Ailbhe had finished up her part enchanting and weaving her fabric the parts for fine-tuning the motor control, Jules himself had to do the majority of the enchanting to make everything else work- which had not really been difficult as it had been tedious. The difficult part he'd dealt with in the months spent designing and making the theorems for the enchantments.

That didn't make this part any easier however. Despite being all but immune to heat, sweat trickled down his forehead as he looked at the image of his older sister projected onto the misty screen in front of him, trying to gauge her opinion of his work.

Mia's mist-form examined his work, thoughtful and silent as she listened to his explanation. She took her time mulling over the details of Jules's design and the reasoning behind it, holding a takeaway coffee cup in her prosthetic hand and occasionally taking a sip.

Her conclusion reached after a moment of pause, his sister broke out in her characteristic vulpine grin. ""Here, let me challenge you for a bit‚Äî""

She launched her review into minutae of his design at speed, alternating between probing questions to identify logic holes and test his understanding of the build and small comments that acknowledge a particularly clever solution. The fact that prosthetics is one of her areas of interest means that while Mia is happy to help, no flaw in the design can escape her eyes (real _or_ artificial).

Eventually, she is clearly satisfied. ""This is some really good work you've got here, Jules! But you know that much, I bet, so we probably can skim over that part.""

Jules couldn't help but grin just a little upon receiving Mia's approval even as he jotted down the notes she gave him for improvement. He felt his shoulders relax as some of the tension dissolved. Though it wasn't like he needed her approval. Or even wanted it. Totally. He just wanted to get her opinion since she was clearly more experienced with prosthetics. That was totally it. And so, what even if it wasn't? Sue him for thinking that his half-bionic older sister was cool. He cleared his throat before continuing, wiping the sweat from his brow and trying not to let his satisfaction show.

""Yep. Yep. Noted. Thanks,"" he agreed, setting down the arm and resting his chin on his knuckles (ill probably edit this based on her reaction this is kinda a placeholder or whatever) ""I'll‚Ä¶ deal with rest later. Right now, I gotta figure out the elephant in the room.""

Jules paused a moment, taking a deep breath before he continued.

""How do I go about attaching it? I'm pretty good with biology but I ain't exactly a surgeon. How'd you attach yours?""

Mia moved the coffee cup off-screen somewhere so that Jules could get a better view of her prosthetic as she tapped the small embossed Eta on the shoulder.

""That's the thing: I can't tell you that one,"" she replies. ""Not for sure, anyway. Gods work on a different set of rules to us mere mortals.""

Jules chewed on his lip nodded along with slightly widened eyes. That‚Ä¶ made alot of sense. She literally had divine assistance in building and attaching her prosthetics. All Jules had was himself- For the latter part at least, he could hardly discredit Ailbhe's part in the actual building process. He thought about it for a moment.

Mia continued through his moment of quiet with words of caution. ""It took a while to understand how it all works once integrated, and I'm not sure I'd try an integration that complex. _Especially_ as my first one. Your design is solid and is different to mine, obviously, but still‚Ä¶ We work on metal, not people.""

Nah, he could do it. He didn't need a god, especially not a deadbeat one like his dad. A small smile curled at the corner of his mouth.

""Hmm. I think I know someone who can help.""

How hard could it be?

_pov: Jules_

A echoes of a hoarse scream haunted the Forge on a night where the sounds of clashing metal and whirring machines seemed to have taken the backdrop to what sounded like the chorus of the damned coming from one of the backrooms.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, Jules thought he'd heard the sound of cracking teeth, but the pain of breaking his teeth on the leather strap in his mouth almost felt euphoric compared to the one that came from where the flesh of his arm writhed in a half-failed attempt at melding with bronze.

The different sort of iron smell filled the Forge. One that was not the usual smell of metal ever present in the Forge but twinged with a sickly sweetness.

The scent of blood was so thick that Jules was feeling lightheaded- or maybe that was just him going delirious from the burning agony of metal spikes digging into the flesh of his arm- into his _bone_ as it cut through the marrow and cracked it open from the inside. Jagged white shards broke through his skin in the alien sensation of something pushing out from _beneath_ his skin and puncturing it, looking almost like seeds on a strawberry.

Wires twisted and mangled the broken stump of his missing arm and the pain made him dully aware of places in his body he'd never even thought of before they'd broke. Desperation clouded any rational thought, and Jules clawed at the bronze arm caught within the steel teeth of the vise holding it in place as if it'd fix what he'd ruined or ease his suffering but metal knew neither pain nor mercy.

Attempting to rip it out now had already left him half blind and screaming from pain- it had worked, but only partially. Bits of viscera still dripped and hung on to the cables and polished metal like sauce on spaghetti.

It wasn't supposed to go like this. It wasn't supposed to go like this. It wasn't supposed to go like this. It wasn't supposed to go like thi-

Jules couldn't remember what had gone wrong or even when it had gone wrong. He remembered the first shot of pain as the metal spike dug into his arm, everything after that had been a blur of agony and gore that would've made his stomach turn and heave if all that was within it hadn't already escaped through the leather strap onto the floor in front of him, mixing with the blood pooling around his feet. A part of him was dully aware of the fact that even if he made it out of this alive with his mind intact he wouldn't be the same person he was before- before the pain. Before he'd twisted and broken his body and put himself into a hell of own making.

He didn't want to die, Jules realised. He didn't want to die He didn't want to die He didn't want to die He was going to die-

He was going to die.

He could feel his vision already blurred from the pain start to darken and no matter how much he tried to hold back the approaching dark, the blood loss was getting to him. It was too late- He couldn't fix it anymore. He couldn't even leave, or call for help. No, he wouldn't call for help anyways no no no no no no, Jules would die, yes, he'd die but he wouldn't fail. He refused to fail. He'd never admit that he failed, and that he needed help.

Despite that for some reason, he still heard an unending scream echo through the room he was in. But he didn't hear a response.

He didn't want to be a failure. He was not going to be failure.

That was his last thought as the darkness took him.

**_pov: Friday_**

Weird week.

Weird, bad, _sad_ week.

_""Sweeeet little unforgettable thing,""_ Friday sings. _""Uunnnforgettable!""_

The former Head Medic skips out of the forest after an late night 'training' her powers (like she's not just playing with plants and zombies), blasting pop music through her headphones and singing along to keep the mood up before she comes back to camp and stops being able to quietly ignore how everyone is clearly thinking about what Happened, with a capital H.

_""Know that I'm not sorry, I'm just loving my body‚Ä¶""_

She doesn't really expect the smell of fresh death on the wind, though.

_""I don't care, if you're scared of a sweeeeeet little unforgettable thing‚Ä¶""_

Well. Okay. So it's not like someone's _dead_ dead, but Friday can sense that someone is definitely in the process of dying. Her otherworldly sixth(?) sense can tell that it's not sudden, either. There's an energy in the air, something that she has secretly always been attuned to, a promise of power and other exciting times.

With a deep breath to take it all in and eyes that very softly glow in the night as if they are catching the light, Friday nods to herself.

Yup, definitely dying.

But not in the medic cabin, where the people who are doing their best to hop the Styx ferry usually end up. None of the cabins, either. Somewhere over‚Ä¶ There? Friday follows her 'nose', letting herself be drawn to the source of the energy as it only gets stronger as she closes in.

_""I'ma do just what I want, on the regular‚Ä¶""_

Friday lets herself into the forge with the spare key she charmed out of one of the forge goobers a while ago, still singing as she closes the door with her hip. Soon this 'commandeered' space will be full of people 24/7, but for now she's alone in the chaos and din of machines running overnight. The cacophany makes it hard to focus on her _other_ sense, but it's probably fine. The usual insomniacs seem to have cleared out ‚Äî did someone kick them out? ‚Äî so that maybe the only people here are the daughter of Persephone and whatever flickering nexus of power is hiding in the backroom.  
  
_""And it's really not my fault if you're scared of a‚Äî""_

Oh, shit.

""Oh, shit!!"" Friday yelps.

It's _Jules_. Jules, with his residual limb _cut open_ and attatched to something horrible and mechanical. Something horrible and mechanical and definitely load bearing, because he's out cold and only halfway to the floor as his wounds tether him to the workbench.

Friday looks through the gore, triaging the unconscious smith by placing a cold hand on his shoulder and immediately silencing his screaming nerves and halting the worst of the bleeding. Botched osseointegration, weird woven tendons, thin metal appendages bathed in blood‚Ä¶ Of course, it's an arm. Of _course,_ it's a messed up back-room auto-surgery of an experimental arm. An arm that's still stuck in the vice???

""Lucy's going to kill you,"" Friday whispers urgently. With one hand firmly planted on Jules's shoulder so she can maintain control of his biology, she talks to the half-dead boy in a stage whisper and awkwardly rolls up her sleeves with her free arm.

""She's going to kill you, and then she's going to kill _me_,"" She mutters to Jules, wrapping her head around the damage.

It won't be easy, but it won't be the first time Friday has done the impossible. She braces herself to take his weight, freeing his metal arm from the vice and letting him crash into her on his way to the ground. It's not the cleanest place to work, but it should be fine. Friday can fix this. She can fix this, and heal him, and he'll be back to normal in a few days. Well. Normal-ish.

And yet‚Ä¶

Friday slows down for a moment, letting her hand slip and taking a deep breath as she drinks in Jules's death. She's always gotten more powerful the closer someone is to their final living moment, looking down at him with wide and shining eyes and the visage of the most beautiful girl in the entire world.

If she had come here later, he would be gone, his soul departed and his body left for her to add to the garden. She could neatly bury him in dirt and viscera, plunging her hands downwards until it comes up to her elbows and gently shaping him into beautiful flowers. It may take some time but like everything else he could be coaxed to her whims, adorning a black iron trellis with petals of transluscent skin and thorns of steel and celestial bronze. She could place him next to the climbing ivy she'd made of the scarred boy, the hardy lightning-rod-turned-coneflower from the pierced girl, so many others from the people she'd healed since she was small.

Somewhere in the back of her mind is a beautiful garden filled with flowers made of corpses and the deaths she had once denied them. It's a place she was made to be the princess of, if not the queen, and yet most of the time she can't remember that it exists. It's only here, breathing in what could be someone's last moment‚Ä¶

Jules makes a strangled cough that was probably a rude word and snaps Friday out of her daze.

""Fuck you too, or whatever it was,"" she says with a grin, coming back to her senses before quickly shouting out to the Forge's smart speaker. ""Don't worry though, I've got this.""

""Hey Miku, play the Forge Friday playlist! And turn it up, please!""

Music blares from the speakers, and Friday gets to work. She places a halved piece of ambrosia under his tongue to melt, thankfully confident that he would lack the strength to bite her fingers off the way he would want to if he was awake. This way she doesn't have to make him eat the thing, and it won't work fast enough to make Friday's job any harder.

With blood-soaked hands, she keeps Jules's body in stasis as she feels for the space where flesh turns to cold metal. His cuts were clumsy and probably not intentional, jagged edges and piercing wounds that were never going to heal nicely, even if he hadn't misfired. Or ripped something. Hard to tell.

Friday hisses through her teeth as she focuses, and slowly the ruined edges peel away from the rest of the wounds. It's kind of like a sunflower's bloom‚Ä¶ If the middle of a sunflower was filled with gore and marrow. She plucks the seeds of shattered bone from him with her power, each one pushing itself out of his flesh and landing on the forge floor with a wet '_plip_' as she undoes the more explosive trauma and gets his arm ready for the hard part.

She's resolved to finish what Jules had started ‚Äî because otherwise she'd probably be killed by Lucy and then again by Jules for fucking up his project ‚Äî as she gets a better look at this mechanical limb. It's a good thing that those forge kids are absolutely obsessive, because Friday can take dissect an arm with her eyes closed and can already tell by touch that they'd gotten it mostly right.

This _should_ work, as long as she just‚Äî

""Okay, okay, okay,"" she breathes.

""Count of three.""

""One‚Ä¶""

""Two‚Ä¶""

Before she says 'three' ,Friday grits her teeth and pushes the mechanical limb into place with a sickeningly wet 'click'. She is quick to pour all the power she can get into his arm to heal the wound around the foreign object so that it integrates, rather than rejects. She breaks into a blood sweat from the effort, seemingly gathering all the light in the room on her red-tinged skin as she focuses on nothing more than getting this stupid arm to connect to this stupid bone, to thread these muscle fibers the right way so he can actually control the stupid thing, and‚Äî _there_.

Maybe, there's a couple keloid scars that will need some extra TLC, but beauty is in the imperfections, or whatever. Friday doesn't know. She's tired.

The power she had taken from Jules's death drops away as she removes her hands from his body, replaced with the sheer exhaustion that follows success as Friday stands and sways in place.

""H-Hey, Miku‚Ä¶"" She calls out. ""Activate the IM setup, please.""

She fumbles through her first aid kit before tossing a bloody drachma through the rainbow that Hatsune Miku happily conjures over the workbench. Her reward is a view of the front desk of the medic's cabin and a shocked Lucy Arkwright. Guess it probably isn't a cute view of the forge, not with all the blood and the unconscious guy lying on the ground.

""Heyaaa‚Ä¶"" Friday smiles weakly, holding up two fingers in a shaky peace sign. ""Help us out? Jules lost a lot of blood, but he's stable. Gave him a half-dose ambrosia while working on it. Um‚Ä¶""

She sways again, blood-tinged sweat catching the worklight. It's not flattering.

""I‚Ä¶ One sec."" Is all Friday manages before fainting through the rainbow and breaking the message link.

_pov: Jules & Lucy_

Nightmares. Machines claws ripping out his insides again. Cutting off what made him weak and human and replacing it with something stronger and more reliable. Were they really nightmares? Or were they just his deepest desires surfacing within his dreams?

The pain in his arm was unbearable, which was strange. Jules thought it'd stop hurting once he died, but maybe he was just in the Fields of Punishment and this was his punishment, being forced to live with his failure, with the humiliation of failing his biggest projects and dying like a _human_.

That stung more than having metal threads fusing with his nerves.

Jules opened his eyes, and the sky wasn't red. There wasn't as much fire and brimstone as he thought there'd be, just the lingering smell of antiseptic and blood. The ground was‚Ä¶ soft?

It didn't hurt as much as it should've either. Jules frowned and reached back to prop himself up.

The sensation nearly made him fall out of what was apparently a cot. He did fall back onto it immediately with a dull thud, eyes shooting up wide as he jerkily raised his arm up. It took more effort than he thought; there was an unfamiliar weight there that he couldn't quite place-

An arm. _His_ arm.

The one he'd made. The one that, until now he'd thought had killed him. Jules froze. He flexed a finger and it‚Ä¶ did. Seamlessly. He moved his wrist and that moved too. As did his other fingers, and all the joints- the angles may have been unnatural for a human arm but that was the intention. It _wasn't_ human.

""What the _fuck_?"" Had it not been a dream then? Had that blue haired girl really saved him? Was he not-

Jules' eyes flickered to the doorframe and there he saw a short, blonde girl who glared at him. Her eyes were red, as if she just finished crying, and her hands were balled in fists.

Nevermind. He was still very dead, or about to be.

""O-oh. Hey, Blondie,"" he greeted Lucy, attempting a smile even as a new fear kindled in his stomach and sent chills down his spine.

Lucy marched to Jules, eyes narrowed as she walked up to his bed. Her glare increased in intensity as she stopped and held out a finger, held in an accusatory point as she poked his chest.  
  
""You‚Ä¶.you almost _died!_ Do you have any idea what state Friday found you in!? Why the _FUCK_ did you do this without anyone observing you? Why didn't you tell me about this!? I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶""  

""Ow-"" Jules winced but immediately shut up as he saw tears gather in Lucy's eyes, his own widening.

  
Suddenly, she collapsed into his arms, sobbing. It was an ugly cry, her nose leaking as she sobbed into Jules' chest.

  
""I was so worried! I thought you were going to‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶I thought you were already‚Ä¶""

She continued to sob in his arms, and guilt replaced the fear churning in Jules' gut. That was a new emotion, he thought idly and wrapped his arms- both of them, around her slowly, letting out a deep exhale. Maybe he wasn't in hell after all, something about holding Lucy like this grounded him back to reality. It made him realise that this was real, he really had woken up alive after that- and hadn't failed. More importantly, _she_ was here. Guilt flowed heavy over the undercurrent of joy and other emotions he didn't have a name for, and it made him feel‚Ä¶ Human.

For once, Jules didn't hate that.

""I'm so sorry Luce. I'm.. fine. I'm alive. I'm here, with you,"" He whispered, stroking her back with a gentleness that was reserved for only her. It was with his new arm. Some part of him buried deep, deep down wished he could feel through it. For now he didn't think about that part and kissed the top of Lucy's head, feeling her in the parts of him that could and closed his eyes. Lucy sniffed and started to speak again.

""You're stupid, if you think that would work with me. I'm still mad at you, what kind of‚Ä¶person just does that to your arm? So..stupid‚Ä¶""  
Her anger, not completely tempered occasionally simmered out between of her hot tears, her muttering stupid over and over again in between her sobs.

Jules smiled despite himself and didn't offer any protest. Maybe things were okay after all. Even if the world was ending.

Markets are navigating a volatile period, with U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies under pressure, while bonds and commodities reflect cautious optimism.

Several months passed after my encounter with Dr. Harrison and the understanding that Mr. Sinclair negotiated between us. In that time, things finally settled back into their regular routine. The patients at the clinic continued to come in for appointments, and they demanded to be serviced immediately by Dr. Harrison. And thanks to Wilson and his effective security, we no longer had any issues of patients trying to leap over the reception desk to try and kill me for simply telling them no. Rachel also let up on her bitchyness, but it did seep out at times.¬†



The biggest issue continued to be with Dr. Harrison, however. For two months after the discussion he had with Mr. Sinclair, James acted like a scolded child. Pouting and avoiding eye contact with me. In those two months, he probably said a single word to me, which was ‚Äòthanks‚Äô after I had given him his usual order of coffee. It began to bother me just how quiet he‚Äôd become. And after the beginning of the third month of his near-total silence towards me, I decided to confront him about it.¬†



I had arrived at work early like I always did, happy to see Wilson at his usual post at the front door. I had made sure that today would be one of the days that Dr. Harrison wouldn‚Äôt need another skin transplant that day. Usually, he was in a terrible mood when his faux skin began to peel away and required urgent replacement. Sine I was now aware of his‚Ä¶condition, I was allowed to know when it usually needed replacement.¬†



I sat down in my chair and anxiously stared at the clock, waiting for Dr. Harrison to arrive, the whole time trying to ignore the concerning noises emanating from the lost and found box. Ever since I discovered the strange bread creature that enjoys taking things from it, I did my best to try and pretend that it didn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôd rather not look at its several eyeballs all looking back at me. It usually takes anything shiny from the lost and found, so I try to keep those things at the top of the box and allow it to simply take whatever it wants to who knows where.¬†



Dr. Harrison soon arrived on time, looking as dejected as he always did nowadays. I clenched my fist tightly as I gathered the courage to confront him over his behaviour. Standing up from my desk, I left the receptionist area and quickly intercepted him before he could enter the back of the clinic.¬†



‚ÄúDr. Harrison? I need to talk to you.‚Äù I blocked his way from the entrance to the back where the surgery rooms and the consultation rooms are. He looked down at me with his bright green eyes, and it was obvious that he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me. He grimaced at me and was clearly contemplating just pushing me out of the way. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just keep ignoring me and acting like a child, James,‚Äù I told him, feeling more like a mother disciplining her annoying child than a receptionist. Though I guess that‚Äôs exactly what I was doing at that moment.¬†



‚ÄúWhat else am I supposed to do, Maggie? The only reason you‚Äôre still here is that you‚Äôre paid to still be here. How do you expect me to feel after what happened at the coffee shop? And after Mr. Sinclair made it clear that I was already acting like a child in his eyes. It‚Äôs better for the both of us if I just keep ignoring you.‚Äù He put his hands on me and started trying to move me out of the way, but I kept myself firmly planted in front of him.¬†



‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre acting like a child,‚Äù I told him again. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why you get treated like a child by everyone. I‚Äôm not asking for things to go back to the way things were, I‚Äôm only asking that you at least make an effort to try and move forward with things. And to at least try and act like you want to be here.‚Äù I sighed as I stared at him. Despite knowing it wasn‚Äôt his true face, I couldn‚Äôt help but deny how beautiful he was. And those hypnotic green eyes were still the prettiest I had ever seen. I reached out and touched his face, and that caused him to flinch. ‚ÄúPlease, at least try to be better?‚Äù I asked him.¬†



He stared at me with those big green eyes, and I watched as they went down to my hands on his cheek. And to my surprise, a soft red hue began to appear on his face. He reached his hand to touch mine, but before he could, I pulled my hand away and gave him the best smile I could. I was only doing this to snap him out of his tantrum. At this point, I‚Äôm honestly wishing I had let him keep up the tantrum.¬†



The rest of the day played out as it normally did. Rachel came in soon after Dr. Harrison did, and we opened up the clinic to a flood of patients. The patients at Dr. Harrison‚Äôs clinic are the main issue besides the surgeon himself. They are fanatics when it comes to getting their cosmetic surgery. And the ones addicted to it are always hounding me.¬†



‚ÄúListen, you fat pig! I need to see Dr. Harrison right now! These crows feet are disgusting and need them removed, now!‚Äù An older woman shouted at me, shoving her bony finger in my face. I cleared my throat and looked over at Wilson, who was already eyeing the patient like a hawk.¬†



‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve already told you, ma‚Äôam, Dr. Harrison is booked up completely for the next six months. Now I can book you an appointment sometime after those six months and have you on a waiting list in case someone cancels their appointment.‚Äù Which has never happened in all of my time of being here. ‚ÄúDoes that sound okay?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúNo, that doesn‚Äôt sound okay! I need to see him now!‚Äù The woman screamed at me, and everyone else behind her also shouted and screamed along with her. Before I could look to Wilson to try and get him to do something, the woman had reached out and grabbed me by the hair and started yanking on it.¬†



‚ÄúMa‚Äôam! Please try to control yourself!‚Äù I shouted at her, grabbing at her hands in an attempt to pry them off of my hair. Before she could do anything else to me, she suddenly let go of my hair. I looked up to see that Wilson had grabbed her by her hair and was now holding her a good foot off the ground.¬†



‚ÄúAre you okay, Maggie?‚Äù he asked with genuine concern on his face. Wilson is a good security guard, and he does seem to really care for me. He isn‚Äôt the smartest cookie, being that he‚Äôs some strange blob creation from Dr. Harrison, but he‚Äôs a good guy, all things considered.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, thank you, Wilson.‚Äù I smiled and fixed my hair from the mess that the woman had caused for me. Suddenly I felt someone standing behind me. Turning in my chair, I was surprised to see that Dr. Harrison was suddenly behind me. He should have been midsurgery, and yet all of a sudden, he was right here. His surgical mask covered his mouth, and his eyes shone with anger at the woman Wilson was holding like a prized fish.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù he asked, pulling his mask down to reveal an upset frown on his beautiful face. The woman was almost instantly passivied after looking at Dr. Harrison, and she stopped flailing around trying to escape Wilson‚Äôs vice-like grip on her hair. Dr. Harrison‚Äôs hypnotic eyes had almost everyone in the waiting room in a trance.¬†



‚ÄúShe grabbed at my hair. I tried to explain to her that you‚Äôre booked up completely for six months.‚Äù I explained to him, being the only one that wasn‚Äôt currently in a trance around him. Thanks to the fact I had a positive opinion of myself and a strong sense of self-worth, Dr. Harrison‚Äôs hypnosis was ineffective to me, only causing me intense headaches if I stared at his eyes for too long.¬†



‚ÄúI see,‚Äù he said with his eyes narrowing as he stared at the woman who Wilson was still holding up. ‚ÄúWilson? See her out. And never let her back in.‚Äù Wilson diligently nodded and carried the woman effortlessly to the door to the clinic. The woman didn‚Äôt say so much as a peep as Wilson tossed her out like a bag of trash.¬†



‚ÄúSir?! We‚Äôre in the middle of a surgery!‚Äù Rachel shouted as she poked her head out of one of the ORs. Dr. Harrison looked back at her and seemed to suddenly remember what it was that he had been doing before coming out here to check on the ruckus.¬†



‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶at ease, everyone,‚Äù he ordered the patients before quickly pulling his mask back over his mouth and sparing a glance at me. I met his glance and saw that the same red hue suddenly came over his face as he quickly walked away back to the surgery he‚Äôd so abruptly left. That scene wasn‚Äôt something new to me, I counted it a good day if only four patients attacked me like that woman did. It had been a lot worse before we got Wilson to act as security. But this was the first time since getting Wilson that Dr. Harrison had come out to see what the commotion had been.¬†



At around lunch time, the patients had finally settled down and were either waiting for their appointment or filling out various forms that needed signing. I looked over at the clock on the wall and leaned back in my chair to give myself a stretch before standing up. Just as I finally stood up from my chair I noticed Rachel staring at me from the other side of the counter.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you say to him?‚Äù she asked me. Rachel is the nurse at the clinic and is usual a frigid cold bitch. But after I learned from Dr. Harrison that she had originally been overweight before meeting him and having one of his surgeries, she‚Äôd been more amicable to me. Though her bitchyness still leaked through at times.¬†



‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked her as I picked up my bag from the car and started searching for my car keys in it. ‚ÄúTo Dr. Harrison?‚Äù I asked, opening my bag and starting to search more diligently for my suddenly missing car keys.¬†



‚ÄúYeah. He seems happier than the past two months. He actually started to make conversation with me again.‚Äù Rachel crossed her arms and leaning against the counter of the reception desk. ‚ÄúWhat did you say to him?‚Äù she asked me again, squinting her eyes at me.¬†



‚ÄúI just told him to stop acting like such a child.‚Äù I shrugged at her as I was about to dump out the contents of my bag and start searching that way. ‚ÄúWhere the hell-‚Äù Before I could ask the question, I noticed burnt bread crumbs at the bottom of my bag. ‚ÄúOh son of a bitch. That thing took my keys.‚Äù I groaned, looking around on the floor for any evidence of the bread creature.¬†



‚ÄúI highly doubt that‚Äôs what put him in a good mood,‚Äù she said, a smile crossing her face as she watched me search around for my keys and the bread thief. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs dummy treating you? Better be worth it to have the waiting room this cold.‚Äù She was talking about Wilson. We keep the waiting room quite cold to ensure that Wilson doesn‚Äôt melt and cause another rampage.¬†



‚ÄúStop calling him that. Just cause he‚Äôs a little slow doesn‚Äôt make him dumb.‚Äù I scolded Rachel as I got down on my hands and knees and began searching for the creature. I noticed a trail of crumbs that started from where my purse had been and led out into the back rooms. ‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù I muttered to myself.



‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have any feelings, not like I can hurt them. Right, Wilson?‚Äù she asked him, looking over towards him as he scanned the waiting room like the diligent hawk he was. Upon hearing his name, he smiled and waved at the two of us.¬†



‚ÄúYou stop making fun of me and move on to him? Do you have anything else going on in your life, Rachel?‚Äù I asked as I stood up from the floor and sighed, placing all the items I had pulled out of my bag back into it. Rachel tsked at me and flipped me off as she made her way back to the ORs and consultation rooms. Just as I was about to go hunt down the bread creature for my keys, I heard jingling behind me. Turning around, I was surprised to see Dr. Harrison standing there with my keys.¬†



‚ÄúSeems that our little friend tried to make off with these,‚Äù he said with a smile as he handed me the keys. ‚ÄúAre you heading out to lunch now?‚Äù He had made a complete 180 in his emotions. He went from a sad, pouting child to a seemingly energetic puppy.¬†



‚ÄúThank you, sir, and yes, I am. Would you like your normal coffee order?‚Äù I asked, clutching my keys for fear of the bread creature appearing and taking them again. He nodded quickly at me, and I smiled back at him. It felt good to see him no longer sulking around. I left the clinic and made my way to the coffee shop that I always visited for lunch.¬†



‚ÄúHey, Maggie.‚Äù The barista, Phillip, greeted me upon my entrance. I smiled back at him and waved hello. He‚Äôs an absolute sweetheart who always knows exactly how to make my order exactly how I like it. ‚ÄúYou want your usual?‚Äù he asked, already in the process of steaming the milk for my latte.¬†



‚ÄúYes, please if you could, Phil.‚Äù I smiled as I approached the counter and took my wallet out. ‚ÄúAlso, get me three chocolate croissants, please.‚Äù He was already way ahead of me and already preparing the bag that he was going to put them into.¬†



‚ÄúDeciding to treat yourself? You usually only get two,‚Äù he asked as he used the tongs in his hands to test the freshness of the croissants for me.¬†



‚ÄúWell, you don‚Äôt get this chubby by only having two croissants a day.‚Äù I giggled as I handed him my debit card to pay for the coffees and the croissants. He joined in my laugh fit as he swiped my card and handed it back to me.¬†



‚ÄúWell, I think you look great, as always,‚Äù he said as he put the finishing touches on my latte and then moved over to pour Dr. Harrison‚Äôs black coffee into a cup. I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle and blush a little. Phillip and I had gotten into the habit of flirting with each other, and I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say that I enjoyed spending time with him every day for lunch.¬†



‚ÄúYou look just as good,‚Äù I told him as I accepted the drinks and bag of croissants from him. He winked at me, and I waved goodbye to him as I exited out into the parking lot. Arriving back at the clinic and sipping on my latte, I was surprised to see people lined up outside the clinic, muttering and shouting in anger. I tried to push past them to get to the door and noticed that Wilson was standing guard at the door outside. Possibly the first time I‚Äôd ever seen him outside of the building.¬†



‚ÄúHi, Maggie!‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúWe had a little situation while you were at lunch. One of the patients attacked Rachel.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but let out a little gasp at that. Sure Rachel was a bitch at times, but she had been getting better as of late, and we had even shared a few laughs together.¬†



‚ÄúIs she okay? What happened?‚Äù I asked Wilson. He had to stop someone from rushing past us by grabbing them by the face and nonchalantly pushing them away.¬†



‚ÄúYou can go inside and look. Dr. Harrison told me to stay here and keep people out till he can fix up the damage on Rachel‚Äôs face.‚Äù That wasn‚Äôt a good sign. If this attack had done damage to Rachel‚Äôs face, I could only imagine how badly she was taking it. The moment I set foot in the clinic, that fear was confirmed as Rachel was screaming at the top of her lungs in anguish.¬†



‚ÄúRachel, get ahold of yourself!‚Äù Dr. Harrison shouted as he tried to keep Racahel lying down on the clinic floor. ‚ÄúMaggie! Thank God, I need you to come over and hold Rachel down.‚Äù His hair was a mess as he desperately tried to keep Rachel from thrashing around uncontrollably. I quickly nodded and placed the drinks down on a chair in the waiting room.¬†



I took Dr. Harrison‚Äôs place and grabbed Rachel‚Äôs hands, trying to keep them pinned to the floor despite her kicks and screams. I got a first-hand view of the giant cut across Rachel‚Äôs cheek. It was deep, to the point that I could see the molars in her mouth. I had to do everything in my power to keep from throwing up on her.¬†



‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked Dr. Harrison as he went through a first aid kit. ‚ÄúI was only gone for 15 minutes!‚Äù I tried to keep Rachel still, but she was in hysterics, screaming and crying uncontrollably. I didn‚Äôt know if it was from the pain or from the fact that her face itself had been hurt.¬†



‚ÄúShe insulted one of the patients, and unfortunately, they had a knife on them.‚Äù He sighed as he pulled out some surgical thread and a needle from the first aid kit. ‚ÄúOkay, tell Wilson to come inside. I can‚Äôt keep him in one piece and also hypnotize Rachel at the same time.‚Äù I quickly nodded and let go of her while Dr. Harrison got to work.¬†



Wilson entered and stayed by the door to keep anyone from trying to bash it down. I nervously sipped from my latte as I took my spot back at the reception desk. There wasn‚Äôt much more for me to do as Dr. Harrison went into the zone to patch Rachel up. It didn‚Äôt take him long to finish up, and he had Wilson carry her to one of the ORs to recover. Dr. Harrison sighed as he pulled off his surgical gloves and looked over at me.¬†



‚ÄúHow‚Äôd it go?‚Äù I asked him, standing up from my seat and offering him his now lukewarm black coffee. He took it and took a big long sip from it after confirming that it was no longer scalding hot.¬†



‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt going to be happy. It was a deep cut, and I had to pull her skin back together with the stitches. It isn‚Äôt going to be pretty. I‚Äôll probably just give her cosmetic surgery after it heals.‚Äù He sighed, brushing his messy hair back into shape, and stared at me for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your cup?‚Äù¬†



I raised a brow at him before looking down at the cup and noticing that Phillip had written my name with a heart on it. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs just from the barista. Me and him like to flirt with each other.‚Äù I said with a little giggle. As I did so, Dr. Harrison choked on his coffee a little. ‚ÄúAre you alright, sir?‚Äù I asked him as he took a moment to catch his voice.¬†



‚ÄúY-yea. Fine. Thank you. I have to check on Rachel,‚Äù he told me quickly before placing his half-full cup of coffee back on my desk and running back to one of the ORs. I was a little confused at his reaction but simply shrugged. I sat back down in my chair and went about finishing up the paperwork I had left to do.¬†



Wilson came back out a short moment later, and he looked concerned about something. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Wilson?‚Äù I asked him, eating one of my croissants carefully so as not to spill too many crumbs.¬†



‚ÄúI just hope Rachel will be okay. I wasn‚Äôt able to protect her‚Ä¶‚Äù He was devastated over not being able to stop the attack on Rachel. I reached a hand out and touched his and did my best to reassure him.¬†



‚ÄúYou stopped anything worse from happening, Wilson. You‚Äôre the best security guard we could have here.‚Äù I told him, and that seemed to cheer him up a bit. He composed himself and went back to his usual post by the door.¬†



I began to wonder if we were going to open the clinic back up with Rachel being indisposed, so I headed back into the back rooms and looked around to see which room Dr. Harrison was in. I found the one where Rachel was resting, she was lying on a surgery table and seemingly knocked out.¬†



Upon opening the door to the next room, I was met with a horrifying sight. I cracked the door open and had to quickly stop myself from screaming. I watched as Dr. Harrison was straddling a patient and plunging a scalpel over and over into their body.¬†



‚ÄúFlirt?! Flirt?! Flirt?!‚Äù he shouted over and over again as he stabbed into the body. I covered my mouth with my hands and tried to swallow my scream. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs flirting now‚Ä¶she‚Äôs‚Ä¶mine‚Ä¶‚Äù He hissed, grabbing the head of the patient, which was being held up by a small strip of flesh. ‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶belongs to me‚Ä¶‚Äù He hissed at the decapitated head before tossing it as hard as he could against the wall with a splat.¬†



In my attempt to keep my mouth covered, the door slowly swung open and interrupted Dr. Harrison in his moment of fury over the patient he was stabbing over and over. He noticed the door opening, and we met each other's gaze. I stared at him in horror as he dropped his scalpel to the floor along with the body.¬†



‚ÄúMaggie! Uh‚Ä¶this was the patient who hurt‚Ä¶Rachel.‚Äù He explained, staring at me and then down at the patient. He started approaching me and smiled a little with blood and gore dripping down his face. ‚ÄúI was just‚Ä¶blowing off some steam,‚Äù he said with a soft giggle. I turned around and quickly fled before he could get any closer to me.¬†



I quickly ran back to the reception area and had to stop myself from screaming and crying. I had simply wanted him to stop acting like a pouting child. But now I was reminded just who my boss truly was. An unhinged, narcissistic murderer. And now, I think he‚Äôs growing obsessed with me.

1k1ix28,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1k1ix28/is_protein_coffee_good_for_you/,Is protein coffee good for you?,"Lately, I‚Äôve noticed a growing trend of protein-infused coffee popping up everywhere. Like a lot of folks here, I found myself wondering: **Is protein coffee actually good for you?** Wanting to find out firsthand, I decided to give **Javy Protein Coffee** a try. After consistently drinking it every morning for a full month, here's my honest breakdown of whether it lived up to the hype.

**Why I Decided to Try Javy Protein Coffee**

I‚Äôve always struggled with morning nutrition‚ÄîI‚Äôm usually rushed, tired, and prone to grabbing sugary drinks on the go. I heard about **Javy coffee** through various online reviews, and the idea of combining my morning caffeine fix with protein sounded pretty appealing. Checking the **Javy coffee ingredients**, I noticed it contained 20 grams of whey protein, natural caffeine, and prebiotics, which seemed like a solid, healthy combo.

I ordered the Hazelnut flavor from their site ([**here's where I got mine**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)) to see what the fuss was all about.

**Taste and Texture‚ÄîSurprisingly Good**

The first test: taste. Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîmost protein coffees are either bland, gritty, or weirdly sweet. But I was honestly impressed with **Javy coffee protein**. Mixed into almond milk with some ice, it dissolved completely with zero chalkiness. The hazelnut flavor wasn‚Äôt overpowering or artificial; it tasted genuinely good. Of course, it‚Äôs not identical to fresh espresso, but it was far better than typical protein shakes and enjoyable enough that I looked forward to drinking it every morning.

**How Did It Affect My Energy and Cravings?**

Here's where it got interesting. My previous morning routine often included a big cup of regular coffee, which gave me a quick burst of energy followed by the dreaded mid-morning crash and sugar cravings. With **Javy Protein Coffee**, the protein content actually helped stabilize that caffeine kick. Instead of spikes and crashes, I had consistent energy throughout the morning, along with fewer urges to snack on sugary stuff. That alone felt like a solid improvement to my daily routine.

**Digestive Benefits‚ÄîA Nice Surprise**

Another unexpected benefit came from the prebiotics listed in the **Javy coffee ingredients**. Within a couple of weeks, my digestion felt noticeably smoother, and I experienced less bloating than usual. It wasn‚Äôt dramatic, but enough to convince me that the combination of protein and prebiotics really did offer some genuine gut-health benefits.

I also tried their short online quiz ([**you can check it out here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)), which was surprisingly helpful in figuring out the best choice for my lifestyle.

**Cost vs. Value‚ÄîIs It Worth It?**

Initially, the price of around $30 per bag seemed steep. But then I considered my usual daily Starbucks habit, which easily cost me about $5 each day. Breaking it down, **Javy coffee** averaged around $1.50 per serving, saving me quite a bit of money over a month. Plus, the convenience of preparing it at home was definitely a bonus.

**Any Downsides to Protein Coffee?**

To keep things balanced, I should mention that coffee purists might miss the flavor depth of freshly brewed espresso. Javy uses instant coffee, after all. Also, because it‚Äôs whey protein, there's a small lactose content (about 1g), so it‚Äôs not ideal for anyone severely lactose intolerant.

**Final Verdict‚ÄîIs Protein Coffee Actually Good for You?**

After a full month of use, I'd say protein coffee‚Äîspecifically **Javy Protein Coffee**‚Äîwas definitely good for me. It simplified my mornings, improved my nutrition, stabilized my energy, and saved me money. It‚Äôs not a magical health solution, but it‚Äôs a practical, tasty way to enhance a daily routine.

Have any of you tried protein coffee like Javy? I'd love to hear if your experiences were similar to mine.",1,1744911857.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to urgent care in a few hours when my husband gets home, just wondering what you guys have to say. 

33F, 140lb, 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 3 kids, high stress life. PCOS: Spironalactone 25mg (this new as of two weeks‚Äî have taken in the past w/o problem‚Äî cystic acne) GERD. I eat very healthy (paleo plus rice and beans, some diary (sheep.goat), and an occasional zero sugar pop (don‚Äôt judge my sins) or coconut yogurt) I walk 2-6 miles 5 days a week. I do really give being healthy my best effort, yet; I‚Äôm still sick and depressed. 

I finally got a doctor who‚Äôd listen to me, and my Ana screening was positive last month; I see specialists (rheumatologist and neurologist) end of May. I have a lot of symptoms and have had them for many years. This entire thing isn‚Äôt a shock to anyone who knows me. As scared as I am, I‚Äôm happy to have something finally come back with some answers. 

Other symptoms for background:
I have pain all over my body, have for five plus years and only getting worse. Episodes of pain all over body‚Äîsome times radiating wave like pain or fibromyalgia pressure points. One of my big toes is numb 24/7; started at tip and is working its way down. Can poke it with a pin and I can‚Äôt feel it. But All tips of Toes go numb sometimes and turn white. Purple webbing on skin all over body. Ice Cold hand and feet all the time. I get rashes, a lot, from seemingly nothing. Usually on neck and face. V shaped rashes on neck. Butterfly rashes on my face. Headaches all the time. Flare up Rashes on elbows that look like alligator skin, very painful. Pain in joints, especially knees and hands. And oh boy am I tired, I‚Äôm tired all the time. I drink a lot of coffee and tea, it does almost nothing. I sleep 10 hours a night at times, and feel like I could sleep forever. Living is hard sometimes. 

Beyond my other symptoms that really suck, This week I‚Äôve been experiencing something I had only experienced a little in the past and absolutely nothing to this degree‚Äî and for reference I always chalked this up to being related to something environmental but this time I have nothing to relate it to. 

my upper eye lids are swollen from the upper eye socket dip to my eye brow. I have open almond eyes‚Äî so they are barely if at all hooded‚Äî but right now it looks like I have a monolid. I took some allergy meds thinking maybe I was allergic to something (very peak me to be allergic to random stuff); it didn‚Äôt help. That was Monday. Now it‚Äôs Thursday, and it had gotten better slowly over the last few days; but this morning it‚Äôs worse. Now it feels like lower eye area‚Äî like where dark circles would appear‚Äî is full. In fact, all of both my eyes/eyebrows feel ‚Äúfull‚Äù; the best way I can describe it is it feels like I‚Äôve been crying‚Äî even tho I haven‚Äôt. The skin is visibly saggy over my eyes, sometimes it is red but that comes and goes, but it constantly looks puckery looking at the inner corners. I can even pull the skin on my upper and under eyes and it will stay pulled out for a short moment before going back to normal. So I thought ok maybe I‚Äôm dehydrated‚Äî drank lots of water. No difference. 

What I‚Äôm wondering is this possibly related to the auto immune thing my doctor suspects in going on? Or maybe it‚Äôs just allergy season and my bodies deciding to hate me? Or maybe I‚Äôm just getting older and my face is rapidly changing? lol idk; I‚Äôd just love to hear what you doctors think. ",1,1744911703.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

\>This is legitimate. I was on the plane a few rows behind the dog and owner. The same dog bit me near my waist while I went to sit down at the gate before getting on the plane. The dog looked to be a German shepherd mix and was pulling the owner around the airport while he was boarding.

Discussion about fake spotting and how to adress service dogs.  

\>How does the no fake spotting rule work when the dog not actually being a service dog would more likely help the community than hurt. Because a service dog is far less likely to display this behavior than a non-service dog being passed off as a service dog. So accounts that said ‚Äúpurported service dog‚Äù or ‚Äúdog said to be a service dog etc.‚Äù could better mitigate the harmful effects from an account like this one.

*‚Ä¶Continuing.*

Esme gushed over the outfit and I had to add my own little bit of sartorial admiration. 

Clyde seemed to be all fixed and better as he stood by his dinner dish with a look of ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

I fed him some of his more expensive repasts and bade Esme and Maggie into the kitchen. Esme found Maggie‚Äôs baking just as wonderful as I. 

Coffee of all stripes around, we chatted and relived the last month and a half or so. 

‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll not be able to leave these three alone‚Äù, Es cackled. ‚ÄúClyde‚Äôs psychiatrist bill would be monumental‚Äù. 

Maggie chuckled and I just harrumphed into my coffee. 

Esme and Maggie got to talking about kitchen-baking stuff. Maggie would be ever so pleased to teach Es how to bake like they do south of the border. All we‚Äôd need is a new blender, mixer, mixing bowls, saucepans, etc. 

I excused myself from the ravages of this estrogen-filled conversation. I was wickedly tired and decided to head upstairs for a little mid-day rack time. 

Clyde had disappeared while Khan and T‚ÄôPau were keeping station out back in their soaking pool. 

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I wearily said, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs right in the world once again.‚Äù

I flip back my blanket and just before I kamikaze in on the mattress, I spy a very large, very dead mouse in the middle of my sleeping area. 

Clyde meowed loudly behind me, turned a well-rehearsed 180^0, and trotted back down the stairs‚Ä¶

I have a problem with mine. Recently I noticed my  espresso wasn't hot enough. Went through all the things you can imagine to adjust. Still not hot enough. Then noticed, mind you I buy same coffee, I grind it the same way, same amount every time, the flow is not there. It looks like I ground the coffee too fine but it's not. And the flow is not there.

Any ideas? OR it's time for a new one or part replacement?

1k1irrt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1irrt,Third Thursday at Buffalo Zoo!,"Went to the zoo because it was free today, my review:

The zoo was pristine! No trash on the grounds, clean bathrooms, friendly staff throughout the zoo. The men's restrooms were spotless, and stocked with toilet paper, paper towels. The hand sanitizing stations throughout the park worked and were filled. The free tickets for today sold out, and you could tell, the zoo was full of life! Entrance for those with tickets purchased online was a breeze.

The animals were absolutely adorable. Polar bears swimming was a highlight for me. Big cats were sunbathing and the gorilla was out of sight. Its a small zoo but the animals looked healthy and almost all of them were with other animals, not alone except for most amphibians and reptiles. 

The food was mostly a hit, and a little miss --  Coffee at the entrance was $4 bucks, not bad tasting. Dippin dots ice cream was a nice cool treat at $10 for a large, and hit the spot! The personal pizza at Slice was $14, and a flop though, maybe it's designed for a kids taste buds versus an adults. Staff at all three food concessions were great- friendly, and tips weren't implied or asked for. They let me walk in with my own water bottle with no issues, and I saw other guest with outside sodas no issue! 



Who else went?!

Overall it was a great experience. I spent 2 hours on a slow loop around the zoo. You could easily make it a full day trip with a lunch break and by stopping at every single exhibit. I did not visit the indoor rainforest.

I'd definitely recommend of taking advantage of the free tickets, very nice family friendly activity!

Time for that time-honored Spanish tradition of siesta. 

I called Es and had a nice conversation as both the twins were fed, clean and happy, at least for the next fifteen minutes. I also informed her of my new duties and that Special Agents Rack and Ruin had just left after clearing out my humidors, refrigerator, and pantry. 

Es laughed and asked what I needed. 

I said ‚ÄúNothing, really, just some sleep‚Äù to which she chuckled. 

After a few more minutes, we hung up as she had to take care of Grandchild #1 and I needed to pad upstairs to pass out for a while. 

I woke up about an hour later, absolutely sweating buckets and uncomfortably warm. A quick glance noted Kahn on my right side, T‚ÄôPau on my left and Clyde doing his impression of a coonskin cap. 

‚ÄúOut!‚Äù, I shouted, ‚ÄúThe lot of you!‚Äù

None of them as much as twitched a muscle. 

I had to answer Nature‚Äôs call, so I carefully shoved Khan to the floor so I could stand and be free and clear to navigate. I admonished him to stay off the bed, at least until my return. 

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù, I sighed as I returned. 

I just went to sleep on Esme‚Äôs bed as it was currently critter-free. 

A couple hours later, Esme‚Äôs bed now hosted over five hundred pounds of Mastiff and a rather large, slightly annoyed Maine Coon. 

Shrugging my shoulders in utter defeat, I rolled over. I gave T‚ÄôPau a little readjustment so I didn‚Äôt sneeze myself to death from her collar fur going up my nose. 

She licked my nose to indicate she approved. Kahn snored and Clyde went through the seven basic ballet moves until he was all comfy on top of my head. 

‚ÄúDamn‚Äù, I said before slipping off to the land of Nod again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet this is what it feels like sleeping in the lap of a Wookie.‚Äù

I woke up later and it was pitch dark outside. I was awakened by Khan‚Äôs favorite trick: him exhaling heavily into my ear. 

‚ÄúMorning! Who needs an alarm clock?‚Äù, I asked, eyes bolting open.  

Khan and T‚ÄôPau both needed to go outside for recon and other duties. 

I decided that since my Circadian rhythms were royally and completely screwed, So, I would grab a smoke and drink, go outside and watch for UFOs and meteors. 

One thing about living in the high desert (>6,000‚Äô AMSL), when there‚Äôs no clouds and little moon, the celestial early morning show is well worth the price of admission. 

My northern neighbor is a plumber and keeps odd hours. He presently pulled up and parked his truck on the other side of our shared fence. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau were up and over in seconds. They woofed a couple of times, which is completely out of character for them. They knew Rudy the plumber, yet they were on heightened status. 

‚ÄúJust checkin‚Äô, boss‚Äù, they seemed to say as they trotted back to the fire pit. 

I wondered. ‚ÄúDid those vests and boots give them a heightened security outlook?‚Äù

I poured them another drink of doggy Power Water as I refreshed my drink. I chuckled at the mental image of Kahn and T‚ÄôPau working border security. 

Friday night came as usual, after a late Thursday and short Friday morning. I have dragooned Juan and Jaime into service handling Khan and T‚ÄôPau at the meeting this evening. 

They cost me $20 each and a Sonic dinner. 

They love Sonic for some reason. I‚Äôd rather eat my own kneecaps than dine there, but there‚Äôs no accounting for taste evidently. 

We packed up and left early as the Community Center was some forty-five kilometers distant. It was a bit of a tight squeeze in my pickup as Khan naturally assumed he‚Äôd ride shotgun. I mean, it is his seat when we are on a job. 

I threw all my gear into the truck‚Äôs bed, while Juan and Jaime flanked T‚ÄôPau in the back seat. 

Khan waited patiently for me to get him buckled in, but that was his seat. I could no sooner shift him than I could train Clyde to retrieve ducks. 

I went over what I wanted Jaime and Juan to do on the way to the Community Center. Over cheesy smashburgers, onion rings and huge, near gallon-sized slushies, I went over my strategy for the evening. 

‚ÄúOK?‚Äù I asked as they partook of mass quantities. 

‚ÄúNo problem, Doc‚Äù, Juan stated. 

I asked if Jaime was green as well.

‚Äú¬øVerde? ¬øQu√©, senor?‚Äù, he asked. 

‚ÄúAre you sure you understand my little plan for tonight?‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúAre we green, that is, are we in agreement? Do you understand? ¬øLo entiendes?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, si, si, senor Doctor.‚Äù, Jaime replied. 

‚ÄúGood‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúJust so we‚Äôre on the same page. Um, as√≠ que estamos en la misma p√°gina.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem‚Äù, they both smiled through their grease-laden dinner. 

‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù, I replied. ‚ÄúPendiente‚Äù.

We arrived at the Community Center and I was surprised to see that the parking lot was nearly full. Luckily, special Agents Rack and Ruin had reserved a spot for me and the guys near the back entrance of the building. 

‚ÄúOK‚Äù, I said, grabbing my gear out of the back of the truck. ‚ÄúWait until the question-and-answer period after the main presentation. There‚Äôll be a ten-minute intermission after my presentation. I‚Äôll swing by if I can and see if everything‚Äôs copacetic.‚Äù

‚ÄúSi, senor‚Äù, came the reply.

‚ÄúPendiente‚Äù, I said once again and headed into the building. 

I didn‚Äôt see Special Agents Rack and Ruin anywhere, but I sort of felt that they‚Äôd show up sooner or later. 

I was greeted by Mrs. Tallulah Tsosie, the Community Center Director. She was a Din√© native and striking in appearance. 

She was also very well educated and had a disdain for abandoned mines that bordered on extremism. She was very pleased to meet me and have me deliver an ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù opinion regarding these murderholes. 

‚ÄúMrs. Tsosie,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI hate these abandoned mines with every fiber of my being. I‚Äôm hardly what you‚Äôd call unbiased, particularly in this case.‚Äù

""Y√°'√°t'√©√©h"", she replied. 

Even I knew that meant ‚ÄúIt is good‚Äù. 

So, we set up and surveyed the room. 

‚ÄúGood crowd tonight‚Äù, I said to her. 

‚ÄúI my years as Director here, we‚Äôve never had standing room only. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the free coffee and cookies that drew them in. I think they want to hear from *K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin*.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù, I asked. ‚ÄúI was hoping they were as tired of these deathtraps as am I.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, she replied, ‚ÄúBut you are well known to the Din√© people. Even people from over 40 years ago remember you when you first arrived.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember that most fondly‚Äù, I replied. ‚ÄúGuess I wanted to come back after all this time and give something back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Of course.‚Äù, she replied, ‚ÄúYou were called and you responded.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúY√©'ii called‚Äù, she explained, ‚ÄúYou replied, K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin. You were, you are, needed. You answered and returned. D√≠igi at‚Äô√°o nl√©√≠dƒôÃÅƒôÃÅ‚Äô. This is the way. ‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, I suppose I did‚Äù, I replied, slightly humbled. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs near that time. Shall we get the show on the road, as it were?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin‚Äù, she said solemnly, ‚ÄúIt is your time.‚Äù

The room grew quiet as she took the podium. There were words in Navajo I didn‚Äôt understand, but then there was the English that was my introduction. 

I smiled broadly as I sincerely love this part of the country and these people. 

‚ÄúDr. Rocknocker, K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin, Ladies and Gentlemen‚Äù. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs showtime‚Äù, I said quietly to myself. ‚ÄúD√≠igi at‚Äô√°o nl√©√≠dƒôÃÅƒôÃÅ‚Äô.‚Äù

There were smatters of applause from the 135 or so people that had gathered. I still haven‚Äôt seen Special Agents Rack and Ruin, but I accepted the podium. I launched into a PowerPoint version of my ‚Äòwhy it‚Äôs really fucking stupid to go into abandoned mines‚Äô, the expurgated version. 

I tried to keep the obscenities down but failed miserably. Thankfully, the audience was in total agreement with what I had to say. 

‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, I said after the last slide. ‚ÄúThere will be a short 10-minute intermission and I‚Äôll come back and try to answer your questions. Thanks. See you then.‚Äù

I really needed a drink as I was dry as the high desert outside. 

I grabbed an institutional coffee and added a bit of flavoring to it from one of my many emergency flasks. 

I slipped out back before being accosted by some of the more eager crowd to check on Khan, T‚ÄôPau, Jaime and Juan. 

When I got to my truck, Jaime and Juan had Khan and T‚ÄôPau tricked out in their recently gifted Agency finest. 

‚ÄúBadass!‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúTotal badass.‚Äù

Juan and Jaime beamed. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau looked like they could overthrow a government just with their looks. 

‚ÄúAbsolute badass.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, remember‚Äù, I instructed, ‚ÄúWhen I call you guys, make certain you tell Khan and T‚ÄôPau to‚Äú*Gib Laut*. Make some noise, I want to establish a point with all this.‚Äù

‚ÄúSi, senor‚Äù, Juan replied. ‚ÄúGib laut?‚Äù

Khan and T‚ÄôPau instantly reacted, barking loudly and menacingly. 

‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt overdo it, guys‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúThis is all for effect. For show. To prove a point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe understand, Doctor‚Äù, the boys affirmed. 

‚ÄúOK‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúListen for the air horn. I‚Äôll hit it three short times, then you come in behind Khan and T‚ÄôPau. It‚Äôll be great,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs affirm‚Äù, Juan said, smiling broadly. 

I appear to be influencing the boys. However inadvertently. 

I returned to center stage and the podium. I balanced my coffee on the adjacent table as Mrs. Tsosie called for the room to come to order. 

We had a microphone set up down by the massed crowd. We asked people to come up, one at a time, to ask their question, then sit down while I explained their answer. Then the next would have a go, *et cetera*.

Questions:

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThese old mines are abandoned. Maybe there is something of value they left behind.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢	
They may be ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù, but someone owns the mine. If it‚Äôs not some company or individual, then it‚Äôs the state. So, if you enter the mine, it‚Äôs *criminal trespassing*, no questions asked. Besides that, there‚Äôs nothing in these mines worth your life. People tend to take things worthy of money rather than leave them behind. But you take something out of a mine, even rocks? That‚Äôs felony theft. Now your misdemeanor criminal trespass is a Class-3 felony as is your Class-3 felony theft charge. 

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre not that dangerous. I‚Äôve been in many.‚Äù 

Statistically, you stand a one in eighteen chance of dying in a mine. So far, you‚Äôve been lucky. The next time you could be injured or contract some nasty diseases. The odds are much lower for that. Also, where are these mines you‚Äôve been in so I can contact the owners and see if they want to press charges?

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhy are the mines abandoned?‚Äù 

Because they are no longer profitable, the mine had become unsafe in which to work, the owner/operators had run out of money to continue operations, or the mine lies fallow until prices once again make mining feasible. Shifting revenues for extracted ores can make seemingly ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù mines simply shut-down temporarily. Dig around in one of those and the owner shows up? You‚Äôre not going to have a good day. 

Stay out, stay alive. 

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDo people die in these mines a lot?‚Äù 

Yes, they do. That‚Äôs a cold hard fact of life. I‚Äôm extensively experienced and have had incredible training. Yet I feel trepidation and, yes, fear, every time I go into one of these murder holes. Why? Because there are people who think they‚Äôre indestructible. They believe bad things ‚Äòwill never happen to them‚Äô. Or they just don‚Äôt care because they believe they know so much more than the experts. 

Or, perhaps they‚Äôre just plain fucking stupid. 

I found and recovered seven local guys that thought they knew all the angles the mines could throw at them. All seven were dead and my teams and I recovered their bat-mutilated bodies for their families before we blew that mine to Hades. 

I‚Äôve gone in on rescues where half the family died and the other half survived because of blind, dumb shithouse luck. The husband and son were dead at the bottom of an eight hundred‚Äô deep shaft they walked over, thinking the rotted wood subfloor was sturdy. Luckily the mother and two daughters stayed put until my teams and I found them. We dragged them out; terrified, hypothermic, and grief-stricken, but alive. 

Yes, people do die, far too often. My teams and I must go in and get them. It‚Äôs not a pretty or glamorous job. But it‚Äôs one fueled by human hubris, greed and stupidity. Unfortunately it seems we‚Äôre never low on those human attributes. 

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one around the mines. Who‚Äôs going to keep us out?‚Äù 

OK, Scooter. If signs, science, and scare tactics don‚Äôt work, how‚Äôs this? The laws are such that if I do work on the mine, any sort of improvements, and file the proper paperwork, I own that mine. 

You are now trespassing. However, you are now trespassing on *my* property. 

Allow me to introduce you to my Security Team. 

(Three short tootles on the air horn.)

Juan and Jaime are physically dragged out by a snarling and snapping duo of Khan and T‚ÄôPau, both barking up an unfriendly storm.  

They seemed to know it was all for show. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen either this seemingly riled or agitated before. 

Such theater.

The entire crowd scooted back a foot or two. 

I loudly said ‚ÄúFu√ü‚Äù and both quieted. 

‚ÄúSitz‚Äù, and they sat. 

‚ÄúBleib‚Äù and they stayed without moving an inch. 

‚ÄúThis is Khan. He‚Äôs my head of Security.‚Äù, I said, patting the furious fur ball on the head and sleight of handed him a quick Little Debbie snack cake. 

‚ÄúAnd this is T‚ÄôPau, his number one.‚Äù

I scratched T‚ÄôPau under her chin and slipped her a Scooby Snack as well. 

‚ÄúTogether, they are my field and home security system incarnate. Now, anyone want to go for a walk in an abandoned mine of ours?‚Äù I growled. 

Jaime and Juan stood there smiling. They knew Kahn and T‚ÄôPau well enough to see through their showmanship; however, they weren‚Äôt saying a word. 

The entire crowd looked on, transfixed. 

It‚Äôs not every day you meet five hundred pounds of angry, snapping canine security. 

‚ÄúI do think I have made my point‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúThe thing is you don‚Äôt know which mines I‚Äôve been working. Are you willing to risk your life even more for a saunter around an old, dirty hole in the ground?‚Äù

‚ÄúStay the fuck out. Stay the fuck alive.‚Äù I said emphatically. ‚ÄúD√≠igi at‚Äô√°o nl√©√≠dƒôÃÅƒôÃÅ.‚Äù

By this time, Khan and T‚ÄôPau had lost interest in the proceedings and lay down on the stage. Cautiously, some local little ones screwed up enough courage to come up and see if these massive mammals were real. 

Of course, Khan and T‚ÄôPau lapped up the attention. Once the kiddies realized that they wouldn‚Äôt be eaten, they had a great time petting both the big fakers. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau reveled in the attention. 

After the lecture, the crowd began to thin out. I shook many hands and was thanked by many more that I was here doing this work. They had heard the horror stories before. 

However, they were just that. 

Stories. 

Fables. 

Rumors.

I was the first one who put meat on the bones of these old tales. I made people realize that these old mines are really and seriously death traps. It‚Äôs not a pretty topic nor subject, and I intended to show it in all its tawdry grandeur.

Mrs. Tallulah Tsosie came up to me after the crowd had mostly departed and thanked me for the presentation. We both hoped that some of the seeds of doubt about the safety of this places would take root and keep someone from making the ultimate mistake. 

She was most impressed with my living version of Show-n-Tell. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau were up on the stage still with Juan and Jaime, reveling in all the attention. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told; you are known to the Nation as K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin.‚Äù She said. 

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúA name I wear with pride after receiving the compliment some 45 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúWe would like to give you something for your work.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs simply not necessary‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúI do this work because of the need and for the common good. That‚Äôs payment enough.‚Äù

She seemed to be ignoring me and walked over to Khan and said something in rapid-fire Navajo. Then she crossed over to T‚ÄôPau and repeated her invocation.

‚ÄúK«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin?‚Äù, she said. 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I responded. 

‚ÄúPlease greet ‚ÄúK«´‚Äô dzi≈Ç ≈Ç√©√©chƒÖƒÖ‚Äô√≠‚Äù and ‚ÄúK«´‚Äô dzi≈Ç naasht'eii‚Äù.‚Äù, she said solemnly. 

I looked at her, puzzled. 

‚ÄúIt means ‚ÄòFire Mountain Dog‚Äô in the language of the people.‚Äù, she said, ‚ÄúK«´‚Äô dzi≈Ç ≈Ç√©√©chƒÖƒÖ‚Äô√≠ for Khan and K«´‚Äô dzi≈Ç naasht'eii for T‚ÄôPau. Like you, they are welcome to the Nation and are protected by the spirits for their works.‚Äù 

I bowed slightly and tried my best to be humble. 

‚ÄúThank you, Mrs. Tsosie‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúWe are honored.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs is the Nation for your works and your concerns.‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúFor that, we invoke the highest thanks and praise.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn behalf of Khan, T‚ÄôPau and myself, we thank you and the Nation.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWe are obliged for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is well earned.‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúI have heard of your exploits some forty years ago, K«´ º dzi≈Ç-hastiin, and see that it was true. You continue honoring the Nation and for that we can only be thankful.‚Äù

I ran out of words at that point and just smiled crookedly and excused myself as I needed to collect Kahn, T‚ÄôPau, their handlers and my gear. Plus a handkerchief as there seemed to be an extraordinary amount of dust in the air. 

I walked over to Kahn and T‚ÄôPau to see that someone had affixed a sprig of sage onto their vests. 

No one knew who had done this and I was puzzled. 

I was told that sage is magical and affords protection to those deemed worthy. 

I smiled wryly. 

I went to the podium to collect my notebooks and see someone had also snuck a sage sprig into my *Rite-in-the-rain* notebook. 

I turned to the north, clapped and raised my hands. Then south, the same.  East, then west. 

I announced quite: ‚ÄúT'√°√° √≠iyis√≠√≠ ah√©hee'!‚Äù [‚ÄúOur sincere thanks.‚Äù]

I thought that was the best way to express gratitude to our unknown benefactor.

The ride home was unusually ethereal. The very desert seemed to light up in the moonlight and the outcrops above the San Juan River were shining like a national guitar. I am following the river down the highway‚Ä¶

Esme thought that my little lecture might have made some difference. She was also worried that all this attention would go straight to Kahn and T‚ÄôPau‚Äôs heads. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Clyde I‚Äôm worried about‚Äù, I said, shooing him off my lap for the third time that day as I recounter the tale to Es. ‚ÄúEvidently sagebrush is in the same family as catnip and the big goof won‚Äôt leave me alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThreaten to take him along in the field the next time you head out‚Äù, Es laughed. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I‚Äôd need.‚Äù, I laughed back. 

In fact, I was going out on a recon mission later that day. I was to meet Cletus and Arch out by a cluster of very old silver and tin mines out in their neck of the North Forty. I figured I should take Khan and T‚ÄôPau with me since they already had their working suits. Might as well put them to work. 

Since the grandkids were doing so well, Esme was going to stay an extra week. I had wished for her to come home, but then I realized she‚Äôs only a few hours distant. I have a large enough backlog of work so that if I hunker down, I‚Äôll not have the time to bitch about her not being here. 

We hung up and went off on our separate missions. It took me over an hour to get Khan and T‚ÄôPau settled into their field outfits. 

They made me look like a vagrant. Boots, socks, shorts, Hawaiian shirt, Agency vest, Ray Bans and Stetson while they‚Äôre tricked out in brand new expensive Kevlar and Cordura outfits. 

‚ÄúHarrumph‚Äù, I harrumphed.

*‚Ä¶Continuing.*

Of course by now Khan and T‚ÄôPau left my bed and trotted down the stairs. Upon seeing Special Agents Rack and Ruin, they bolted through the open front door. I allowed that for the time being.

They were intent on showing how much they love the Agents as they usually bring treats, toys, and other canine diversions. 

I call Khan and T‚ÄôPau back as Special Agents Rack and Ruin approach the front door. 

‚ÄúLet me help you with those‚Äù, I said. 

‚ÄúNope‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got these but are bereft of cigars and drinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù, I quickly replied. 

‚ÄúGood thing I made a pitcher of Rocknockers‚Äù, I thought. 

Once settled in, Special Agents Rack and Ruin commented on the aroma emanating from the back yard. 

‚ÄúLet us repair to the back‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúWhere I can regale yon weary travelers with drink and smokes.‚Äù

So that‚Äôs where we went. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau led the pack, as Clyde was sitting on his newly found perch, watching all this action with highest interest and probable feline disdain. 

‚ÄúDrinks all around‚Äù, I loudly proclaimed and within minutes, we were three characters anticipating the goodies currently being created on the grill. We were also having cocktails as it had to be 5 o‚Äôclock somewhere, as were enjoying some fine cigars I had ordered form some other place rather than those boobs in North Carolina (see rant previous‚Ä¶).

Khan and T‚ÄôPau nosed around the large boxes the agents had brought with them. I also was most interested as I had no idea up to what the agents were. 

I was interested, but Khan and T‚ÄôPau were fixated on these very same boxes. Finally, Agent Rack caved and with a flick of the switchblade he always carries, the boxes were laid open. 

He pulled out something which I couldn‚Äôt quite place. It was labeled ‚ÄúK-9‚Äù, sported a natty   *Rocknocker Resources* embroidered company patch, and possessed a significant amount of gravity, as it was unexpectedly heavy. It was made of a tightly-woven black material, festooned with carabiners, pockets, handles and places for the location of ballistic plates. 

‚ÄúHell‚Äù, I exclaimed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs canine body armor!‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely, Herr Doctor‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our gift for Khan and T‚ÄôPau.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, man. This is so cool!‚Äù, I shouted, completely forgetting that I was a card-carrying member of the Old Phart Collective. ‚ÄúAmazingly agreeable‚Äù, I quickly corrected. 

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, Special Agent Rack smiled. ‚ÄúWe had these characters show up at the Agency touting their wares for our in-house canine companions. While Special Agent Rack and I don‚Äôt have any such animals, we knew two that worked out in the field with a barely-stable petroleum geologist doing some very nasty field work indeed.‚Äù

I was impressed, slightly freaked out, and deeply appreciative all at the same time. 

Special Agent Ruin continued, ‚ÄúThese are custom-made Nomad Kevlar-Cordura Ballistic Body‚Ñ¢ K-9 Vests. Wind, rain, and waterproof, they are Level IIIA, and they offer great protection. It‚Äôs suitable for high-velocity 9mm and .44 Magnum ammunition as well as knife, stab, and cactus resistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúColor me impressed‚Äù, I said looking at the item obviously designed for Khan. 

Also included were two sets of Cordura-Kevlar dog boots. These were high-stepper types with what appeared to have socks to cover the lower half of the dog‚Äôs leg, like human gaiters, terminating in rugged boots with their own, genuine Vibram non-slip waffle-bottom all-terrain soles. 

‚ÄúThose are for this preposterous place you‚Äôve chosen to settle‚Äù, Special Agent Rack observed. ‚ÄúThese are puncture-resistant, breathable and keeps doggy feet happy even when the ground temperature exceeds 130^0 F.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot only that‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin added, ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a couple of pair of [RexSpecs]( https://k9tacticalgear.com/products/rex-specs) 4 XL tactical goggles for the beasts. What with you parading around the desert with that bulldozer of yours, you must kick up a dust storm *haboob* every time. Gotta protect the doggos vision.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut how‚Ä¶? They‚Äôre larger than any usual dog size chart. How?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúOh, well, Doctor‚Äù, Agent Ruin continued, ‚ÄúWe called Esme last month while you were out. She supplied all the measurements. Then we gave the task to the providers of such accoutrements as we told them that this was a test. A litmus test to see if they could follow orders that were, well, shall we say, somewhat out of the ordinary?‚Äù

‚ÄúEsme never breathed a word of this to me‚Äù, I said bewilderedly. 

‚ÄúWe swore her to silence‚Äù, Special Agent Rack chuckled. 

I sat there with a warped grin on my face thinking that even I could never order Es to do anything, much less keep it a secret. 

‚ÄúWell, Herr Doc‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin said, ‚ÄúShall we see if they fit?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely‚Äù, I replied excitedly. It takes a lot to get my interest piqued, but these‚Ä¶these were amazing. 

To say that they fit perfectly was an understatement. Even without their winter coats, it took some small amount of wrangling to stuff them into their new body armor. 

It was the canine version of the vests Special Agents Rack and Ruin have gifted me on occasions previous. Full of pockets, level IIIA ballistic tactical plates, loops, hooks, handles, pockets and all sorts of extra heavy-duty safety-related doodads and gizmos.  

With those boots and goggles on they could have easily cast in any movie where some evil character wants to take over or begin his own country. 

They simply exuded confidence and warnings for people to be very, very cautious. 

Khan and T‚ÄôPau looked very sharp, proud, and if they could speak, I think they‚Äôd be saying: ‚ÄúI am ready, man.  Ready to get it on.  Check-it-out. I am the ultimate badass...state of the                     badass art.  You do not want to fuck with me.  Hey Doc, don't worry.  My partner and I, another of member of the ultimate canine badasses, will protect you. Check-it-out...‚Äù

I swear it was the dusty New Mexico wind that had blown something into my eyes, but there were definite sniffles of appreciation welling up. 

‚ÄúDamn‚Äù, I said to the Special Agents, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre even personalized. Khan and T‚ÄôPau, right there are blaze-orange letters. Against the black of the fabric, that‚Äôs easily spotted for miles.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad you like them‚Äù, Special Agent Rack mentioned, ‚ÄúSeems the beasties like them as well. I swear, I see someone walking down the road with this pair by their side, I‚Äôd instantly cross the street. In the next town over‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGentlemen‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúNot only am I impressed, but I am touched by these gifts. These vests, boots and goggles afford great protection, for everyone, not just our little troupe, but anyone with an idea of getting physical.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the idea‚Äù, Special Agent Rack noted. ‚ÄúHowever, these vests aren‚Äôt free. Like everything with the government, there is a *slight* catch.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúHow much? You take American Express?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm. No, Doctor‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin continued, ‚ÄúAlthough these vests were north of $2,000 each, it‚Äôs not money we‚Äôre expected to collect.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù, I said, slightly perplexed. 

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, Special Agent Rack resumed. ‚ÄúWe need your time.‚Äù

‚ÄúO‚Ä¶K‚Ä¶?‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm really confused...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are slated to‚Ä¶‚Äù, Special Agent Rack continued, ‚ÄúTo deliver a series of lectures at various town halls, VFW halls, and schools; on the dangers, and, as you put it, the utter idiocy, of going into abandoned mines.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Äù, I replied guardedly. 

‚ÄúYep‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin said, ‚ÄúThere no such thing as free lunch. We want you to take Khan and T‚ÄôPau with you when you deliver your lectures. So, there‚Äôs a part of the reason we had these vests created.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúPlus‚Äù, Special Agent Rack went on, ‚ÄúWe would be inconsolable if anything happened to Khan or T‚ÄôPau when you‚Äôre out doing your de-mining work.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn it‚Äù, I said, my nose now needing a good wipe, ‚ÄúJust when I thought I had you characters figured, you go ahead and pull a colossal niceness. Gentlemen, I am touched.‚Äù

Kudos to Special Agents Rack and Ruin not saying anything when I left that straight line open. 

‚ÄúGentlemen‚Äù, I said, rising to refresh the pitcher of Rocknockers, ‚ÄúI propose a toast.‚Äù

Actually, more than one. Several more.

It was then I realized I needed to get some victuals down these guy‚Äôs gullets before they get all toasted out and toasty‚Ä¶

Khan and T‚ÄôPau strutted around the house, into the backyard, then out front to show any passers-by just who lived in this particular domicile. 

‚ÄúYeah. We‚Äôre fuckin‚Äô bad.‚Äù, Kahn and T‚ÄôPau seemed to be saying. ‚ÄúYou better be careful.  Plenty of vultures out here. Fuck with us or our family, and they'll pick your bones clean before morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúBadasses all!‚Äù, I smiled widely. 

I am forbidden by the Special Agents and the Agency to post any photos, but look [here]( https://legacyss.net/product/k9-iiia-dog-vest-dual-threat-vest/) to get an idea of what outerwear Khan and T‚ÄôPau are currently sporting. 

Clyde remained perched up on the fireplace mantle with a look of ‚ÄúI certainly hope you didn‚Äôt get one of those for me.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt terribly interested. 

But Khan and T‚ÄôPau strutted around the house, the yard, front and back. It took both Special Agents and I over twenty minutes to remove the vests and boots from Khan and T‚ÄôPau. 

‚ÄúI take it that you like the vests‚Äù, I said to Khan and T‚ÄôPau. 

They woofed in affirmation. 

I split the knuckle bone from the ham for Khan and T‚ÄôPau. Even Clyde received some turkey treats, as I was feeling very generous. 

Over cigars in the back yard, after Special Agents Rack and Ruin dragged in their personal regalia and stored them in the guest bedrooms. We went over the conditions of my part of the canine body armor ‚Äògifts‚Äô. 

‚ÄúJust once a month for the time being‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin explained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to review what you‚Äôre going to say just to be certain that there‚Äôs no direct nor inferred mention of the Agency having anything to do with your de-mining activities.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho, me?‚Äù, I protested. ‚ÄúOf course, you know I‚Äôll comply. I don‚Äôt want a mutiny on my hands.‚Äù

Special Agents Rack and Ruin smiled, partly due to the situation and partly due to their being half in the bag. 

Esme had called to relate that she had indeed arrived at the grandkids abode. She arrived some hours earlier but decided to wait a bit before she phoned home. 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said into the cellphone telephone device, ‚ÄúSpecial Agents Rack and Ruin are here. Nice of you to keep their little secret from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink nothing of it‚Äù, Esme chuckled. ‚ÄúFor a brief while, I knew something you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt love this woman any more than I did at that moment.

We chatted about the Grandkids, their parents, their abode and just how much Texas traffic sucked.  

‚ÄúWell‚Äù, Esme said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôve got to feed the boys; I think you need to do the same.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes indeed‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúGlad you made it OK and everyone‚Äôs good and things are fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a first‚Äù, Es chuckled. 

‚ÄúAgreed‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúTalk to you later. Love you.‚Äù

We both hung up at the same time. 

During this lull in the action, Special Agents Rack and Ruin attacked the comestibles I had prepared for them. 

To say they could pack away the calories was like saying that Lake Baikal is wet. Smoked ham and turkey disappeared, as did the various salads and other home-made comestibles. 

Along with another pitcher of Rocknockers and numerous pulls on my outdoor three-beer station. 

After we poured the Special Agents into their bedrooms, I puttered around the backyard cleaning up debris from the latest little windstorm. Khan and T‚ÄôPau helped by disposing of any organic residue, i.e., plates with bits of leftover smoked ham and turkey, left by the evening‚Äôs revelers. 

I ventured up to my office, as I had some ideas regarding the visuals for my talks with local indigenous folks. I didn‚Äôt realize it was morning until I went to fire up my third cigar of the night and saw ol‚Äô Sol peeking in from the east. 

Once I get on a project, there‚Äôs that immediate first blush of energy. 

‚ÄúGotta show this. And this. And that. Oh, yeah. This as well.‚Äù, I thought. 

I padded down to the kitchen to fire up our bespoke coffee machine. I kept it under 20,000RPM so as to not awaken our house guests. 

I needed caffeine, in heroic quantities. I‚Äôm also certain that a couple of Special Agents would appreciate that, along with bottles of Super Water, aspirin, and durian juice (a well-known Asian hangover cure) for their pre-breakfast. 

I fed Khan, T‚ÄôPau and Clyde as the coffee machine whirred through its byzantine machinations. I had just let the two canines outside for their morning reconnaissance, when I heard the steam klaxon of the coffee machine indicating precision doneness. 

I was sipping on a perfectly brewed Greenland coffee when I heard a knock on the door. 

Wandering over, I was beaten to the punch by Khan and T‚ÄôPau. 

It was Ernie and Maggie‚Äôs kids Juan and Jaime.

Seems it was time for Khan and T‚ÄôPau‚Äôs morning constitutional. 

I whistled for the hounds and told Juan and Jaime to wait a couple of minutes. 

I wrested Khan and T‚ÄôPau into their sporty new vests and boots. I clipped their leads to the appropriate rings. I did forego inserting the Level IIIA tactical ballistic plates, as I don‚Äôt think we had too many foreign insurgents out and about at this ridiculously early hour. 

I opened the door and Juan and Jaime both did that low whistle when you see something invariably impressive. 

‚Äú*¬°Dios mio!*‚Äù, Juan exclaimed. ‚ÄúICE! Border agents?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope‚Äù, I smiled, ‚ÄúJust a little present from some friends to keep Khan and T‚ÄôPau safe.‚Äù

Both boys looked and looked, not knowing to feel scared or better protected when they take these two out for morning walkies. 

‚ÄúOK‚Äù, I said, handing over the reins, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to get to work. Please be back withing an hour. It‚Äôs going to be a warm one today and I don‚Äôt want these two overheating.‚Äù

They acknowledged that fact as I handed them both a bottle of cool Masafi water. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hot out there for humans as well‚Äù, I said, looking into the distance and seeing the first density ripples forming from the baked and naked sage scrublands of the high desert plateau. 

‚ÄúGracias, senor‚Äù, they both said and disappeared with Khan and T‚ÄôPau before I could even reply. 

‚ÄúThose dogs are going to be exhausted when they return‚Äù, I thought. ‚ÄúBest set up their cool-down room.‚Äù

In the basement, we have a subterranean patio. I‚Äôve rigged it for water on demand and lots of bare concrete with many fans sweeping the area. For dogs as big as these two, they need to flop down, spread out and quickly drop their temperatures. I am glad we had recently taken them both to their canine beautician and they had stripped their winter coats. 

Thing is, the Tibetan Mastiff have a thick, double coat consisting of a harsh, straight outer coat and a soft, woolly undercoat. Fine for the high plateaus of Tibet in winter, but here in the high desert summer, we must watch them closely so that they don‚Äôt overheat. That‚Äôs why we spend a large chunk of change twice yearly to get them both stripped. 

Normally, they shed their undercoat once a year, typically in late spring or summer, requiring more frequent brushing to manage the shedding. We forego that and give nature a helping hand via their doggy barbers. 

I could hear happy woofing and barking off in the distance, so I knew that they were in good hands with Juan and Jaime. 

Clyde, of course, was manning his patrol perch on the fireplace mantle. 

‚ÄúSo lazy‚Äù, I said as he was only barely able to stick out a paw as I walked by. 

‚ÄúMissed me, ya‚Äô big doofus‚Äù, I said on my way back to the kitchen. 

I decided on just a quick breakfast of smoked ham and turkey breakfast burritos. They consisted of scrambled emu eggs, cumin, coriander, garlic, smoked jalapenos, fried onions, spring onion, cayenne pepper and *queso fresca*, all wrapped up in stone-ground soft corn tortillas. 

I made enough for three as I figured unless they expired last night, the Special Agents would be sallying forth soon in search of solutions and sustenance. 

If they did, I‚Äôd need a hearty breakfast anyway, so I loaded up the cast iron skillet for another round. 

The smells emanating from the kitchen did their magic. Soon two very bedraggled and unkempt Special Agents padded their way slowly into the kitchen. 

‚ÄúCoffee Black for Special Agent Rack and Kiddie Coffee with cream and sugar for Special Agent Ruin.‚Äù I chuckled and sipped my own Greenland Coffee. 

‚ÄúHow? Wha‚Ä¶?‚Äù, the two disheveled Special Agents queried. 

‚ÄúFeeling a bit under the weather, are we?‚Äù, I chided in-between bites of ham and turkey tortilla. 

‚ÄúIs that Greenland Coffee?‚Äù, Special Agent Rack asked as I sipped away. 

‚ÄúOf course‚Äù, I replied. 

‚ÄúGive me strength!‚Äù, he said exasperatedly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre relentless. You were out last night as long as we were, why aren‚Äôt you feeling like a three-day rain?‚Äù

‚ÄúI avoid hangovers by staying well-lubricated‚Äù, I laughed, ‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôve been working and haven‚Äôt been to bed. I expect to do that later today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôre the hounds?‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin asked. 

‚ÄúOut doing their morning constitutionals‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúLocal boys, Ernie‚Äôs kids, take them every morning for their daily romp.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood‚Äù, Special Agent Ruin related, ‚ÄúNothing against them, but if I heard one of those beasts bark this morning, I think my head would explode.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have cures for that‚Äù, I said. I handed him the vitamin-and-anti-oxidant packed Super Water, a frosty glass of durian juice and a couple of genuine German Bayer aspirin. 

Special Agent Rack also received the like. 

‚ÄúNow‚Äù, I said, ‚ÄúHow about some breakfast?‚Äù

‚ÄúGot any Maypo? Farina? Cream of Wheat?‚Äù, Special Agent Rack pleaded. 

‚ÄúHow about fresh smoked ham and turkey Scotch Bonnet breakfast burritos instead?‚Äù I asked, only half chuckling. 

Give the Special Agents their due, they didn‚Äôt really turn green until I offered them both a glass of warm pork. 

They both looked me in the eye and stated with fierce conviction: ‚ÄúWe sort of hate you right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúGreat. Tonight‚Äôs bill of fare includes smoked calf‚Äôs liver, onions and smoked Swiss cheese.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe *really* hate you right now‚Äù, as they looked at me with eyes resembling baseballs of very lean bacon which were twitching like a myoclonial medusoid.  

Luckily, we have an ample number of bathrooms so that each could have their own bit of privacy. 

Juan and Jaime returned as both Khan and T‚ÄôPau are panting mightily. The boys helped remove their battle-gear as both immediately headed downstairs to their custom-made canine cooler. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt improve over instinct‚Äù, I said. 

I paid Juan and Jaime as well as giving them a Care package of breakfast extras. 

‚ÄúSame time mana√±a, Dr. Roca?‚Äù, Jaime asked. 

‚ÄúUnless there‚Äôs a monsoon‚Äù, I replied, ‚ÄúSame time tomorrow.‚Äù

‚Äú–î–æ —Å–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è!‚Äù[Da Svidonya!], they both smiled and ran home with their bounty. The guys knew I spent many, many years in Russia and they loved to hear my tales from that far distant land. They even picked up a few words here and there. Hearing Russian with a Mexican accent is most unusual and befuddling. 

After Special Agents Rack and Ruin were brought back to planet earth, we all gathered in my office to review my previous night‚Äôs work. 

Odd, I opted for a nice maduro cigar. Special Agents Rack and Ruis demurred. 

Can‚Äôt for the life of me imagine why.

Anyways‚Ä¶

I basically PowerPointed my last rant of why visiting abandoned mines is a fucking stupid idea. 

It‚Äôs on the server [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Rocknocker/comments/1id6b7a/why_exploring_abandoned_mines_is_a_really_fucking/) if you want to read that over. 

Special Agents Rack and Ruin sat at attention as I gave an impromptu presentation based on what I‚Äôve seen and experienced of the last several years. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm stayin‚Äô out. You‚Äôve convinced us‚Äù, they both agreed. 

‚ÄúTwo down, several million to go‚Äù, I sneered. 

‚ÄúYou really take this shit personally, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù, Special Agent Rack asked. 

‚ÄúI try to stay all clinical and detached‚Äù, I agreed, ‚ÄúBut when you think of the vast stupidity, inculcated ignorance and just plain absurdity of going into these murderholes, it‚Äôs disheartening. Particularly when the experts warn you that you‚Äôre a criminal if you do and could very, very easily end up dead. Yeah. It peeves me no end.‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, then‚Äù, Special Agent Rack replies. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find out tomorrow. We‚Äôve got you slated for 1800 hours at the *Teec Nos Pos* Community Center. A nice little venue for you and your charges to hopefully change the minds of some of the locals. Remember, there‚Äôs always a Q&A session afterwards.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you be there?‚Äù, I asked the Special Agents. 

‚ÄúMaybe. Maybe not‚Äù, they both chuckled. 

‚ÄúSo, you will be there. Incognito.‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù

Special Agents Rack and Ruin regrettably had to leave right after lunch. I fiddled with the PowerPoint to adjust this and jack with that. I realized that it was now 1300 hours, and I hadn‚Äôt had any sleep for the last 36 hours, I decided it was time.

1k1imu4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1imu4,DAT Score (440),"I took my test on April 2nd and I am very happy with my scores! I used Booster and basically followed the 12 week schedule to a T. Here‚Äôs my breakdown:

Quantitative reasoning(480)- Watched all of the videos and did all of the question banks. This section came pretty naturally to me so I didn‚Äôt focus on it too much. 

Reading Comprehension (400)- I did worse than I expected but that‚Äôs okay! I felt that the actual DAT passages were much harder to get through than Booster. I used search and destroy during practice tests and on the real thing. If I could go back, I would have read more science based articles. 

Biology(480)- This section as you can see kicked my buttt for sometime. IF HAD KNOW THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE MY SCORE IN FEBRAURY I WOULD HAVE NOT BELIEVED IT! I watched all of the videos but in hindsight I wish I just read  Bootcamps high yield notes along with booster cheat sheets and Bio Bits. This is what I did for my last month or so and it helped me a lot. I also made physical flash cards for every single practice test question I missed. I also would make a card for the answer than I chose so I would know what question it would be the correct answer for. I used boosters anki deck for about 3 weeks during my studying but I found it to be too dense so I focused on cheat sheets for review. I would try to read as many as I could each day for the last 2 weeks. With this section the actual test felt wayyyy easier than practice tests. 

Gen Chem (390)- I actually loved my Gen chem courses but was iffy with it while studying. I was definantly more stressed about bio and orgo which shows lol. If I could go back I would focus a little bit more on this subject but not too worried about it! Each test is different. I used boosters anki during phase 2 which I did like I just wish I kept up with it until the end! I also did all the practice banks and made flash cards for any missed questions like biology. 

Orgo(440)- This SHOCKED ME. I left the testing center feeling okay about every section but this one. This is what I scribbled down on my break: orgo- so odd and def harder than booster or not representative. Some easy questions. I saw repeats. Maybe 5 reactions lots of questions about polarity and solvents. Some intermediates. lol guess I did know what I was going. I used anki during phase 2 which I think helped a lot. I also had to go back to the basics 2 times which helped me start increasing my scores. Make sure you have a good understanding of IUCPAC naming and stereochemistry before going to the reactions. I didn‚Äôt do this at first which required me to have to review it extensively. I also made flash cards for every practice question missed and I did the reaction question banks over and over. I also made physical flash cards for all of the reactions on Bootcamps Orgo Cheat sheet. I liked it more than booster. 

PAT(440) PRACTICE practice practice. I was really good about being consistent with it at first and then during phase 2 and phase 3 I was putting so much time towards the sciences that I fell off. I picked it back up for the last 3 weeks which I think helped a lot. I watched the videos and went to the easiest sections first. I did this order: hole punching, angle ranking, cube counting, pattern folding, TFE, then Key hole. I highly recommend do that but putting it in order of what comes easiest for you.  If you are struggling in a section, go back and watch the videos. Do timed practice every day if possible!

Ending notes: STUDY HARD! Don‚Äôt make excuses.  Try your best to stay on track but if you really can‚Äôt do something, just make sure you fit it in to the schedule for the week. Take your off days and use them to really rest. It‚Äôs important to have time to yourself to recharge. Remember to change up your study areas. I used a study room at my apartment complex, public libraries, and coffee shops. Sometimes I would go to 3 places in one day to keep my brain awake. I was studying for about 6-8 hours on my study days. 

My biggest tips:

- Whenever you are struggling in any section go back to the BASICS. Give it about a week consistent days and you will see results. 
- Don‚Äôt get caught up in the 500+ scores. These are great and so exciting for these people! But acceptances are mostly made up of the average 420 area. Keep that in mind as you study to stay encouraged.

Happy studying, thank you to everyone‚Äôs posts who helped me along the way. Ask any questions and I will do my best to answer:)

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret¬†*was*¬†the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace ‚Äì green, dense, faintly humming ‚Äì became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed in stellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He placed it in my hand. Solid. Too heavy for its size. Green like‚Ä¶ nothing natural. Like envy, maybe. Or poison.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† His earnestness, a fragile shield against‚Ä¶ what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume. Necessary ballast.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I remember pressing it hard against my skin sometimes. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reading mother‚Äôs diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to¬†*be*¬†her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm.¬†*This time, Lana.*¬†His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches, it suddenly catches against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry only the echo of his pain. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.¬† Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.¬† ¬†She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare‚Äînot judgment, just‚Ä¶ always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she‚Äôs already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.¬† ¬†Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?¬† The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It‚Äôs more like diorama of my entrapment: I‚Äôm like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.¬† Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn‚Äôt lie. Its green simply¬†*is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people‚Äôs eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that‚Äôs the biggest lie of all ‚Äì mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

14.¬† Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.¬† What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines¬†*you*?

16.¬† Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet‚Äôs Nymph√©as for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.¬† Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box Nell had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.¬† People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

19.¬† From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

20.¬† The Talon. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then Clark would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise.¬†*This time, Lana.*¬†And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat:¬†*No.*

21.¬† Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is‚Äîcool and green; perpetually tender.

22.¬† He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

23.¬† I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.¬† Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

24.¬† The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.  
  


25.¬† Sometimes, it‚Äôs just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

26.¬† A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.  
  


27.¬† Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

¬†

28.¬† Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.¬† That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in¬†*The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.¬† And Lex. He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn‚Äôt carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.¬† Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.¬† Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.¬† That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.¬† A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser.¬†*That*¬†green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.¬† To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.¬† My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill‚Äîthe familiar smooth shape.

37.¬† How to describe Lex‚Äôs control? Not chains. More like‚Ä¶ altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.¬† His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.¬† What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The¬†*wanting*¬†is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.¬† To want truth so badly you‚Äôd tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.¬† Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just‚Ä¶ gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.¬† Is it perverse to miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.¬† The false pregnancy. Lex's masterpiece of control. Made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.¬† I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It‚Äôs more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.¬† Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

46.¬† Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you‚Äôve forgotten how.

47.¬† Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.¬† Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.",1,1744910946.0,notgoodphilosophy,0,1.0,False

I love his music and him as an individual and I‚Äôve always looked up to him.

Last year, I finally got his attention and he told me that he appreciates me and all my support. He followed me back and we got to chatting, and formed a friendship over time. He lives very close to me, so we even got to meet up and get coffee.

He found out I‚Äôm into videography and asked if I wanted to help him shoot a music video. I was ecstatic, and of course I immediately accepted. It was so much fun, and for months after we shot it, I would watch the video every single day and just feel so proud and happy. It all felt so surreal.

After that, he started asking me for more favors. Just small things at first, like promoting his new music by posting videos with the audio or reposting things on my story. Nothing I minded. Then he would ask me to help organize fan events, which again, I happily obliged.

Recently, he had me help shoot his newest music video. Afterwards, for the first time ever, I asked if I would be able to be paid for my work, to which he assumed I was joking. When he realized I was serious, he told me ‚ÄúI know my number one fan would never ask for that‚Äù, and so I dropped it.

I still love him, and feel so damn grateful to be this close to him and be someone he relies on. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel fair that I‚Äôm putting in so much labor and not getting paid out of it. I don‚Äôt wanna sound ungrateful, but it is hard work. 

How do I approach this with him? I‚Äôm so conflicted‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd seriously appreciate some advice or insight, thank you so much.",12,1744910909.0,relationship_advice,23,1.0,False

1k1iihg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1k1iihg/i_tried_staying_friends_with_an_ex_here_is_what/,I tried staying friends with an ex. Here is what happened.,"Spoiler... don't stay friends with an ex, and don't rebound either.

I broke up with my ex-boyfriend in June 2024. We agreed to finish out the lease together, which would come to an end in January, and we agreed to try and stay friends. I rebounded with a male work friend and he asked me to be his girlfriend literally one month later. Meanwhile, my ex was hitting it off with one of HIS coworkers.

Living with him was hell, especially because his new girl was living with her family still and my new guy was homeless. So we had to schedule times to bring our new partners over when the other one was gone. Jealousy ramped up on all four parties. My ex and I got into it multiple times. My new partner HATED that I was still trying to be friendly with him, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells living with my ex.

I developed a horrendous drinking problem. Thankfully we lived in a 2-bed apartment, so when I couldn't have my partner over and my ex was home I'd hole up in my room, piss drunk with the door closed. The drinking got so bad I gained a ton of weight, my liver started to hurt, and I even- I apologize for the TMI- shit myself a couple of times. Because not only was I battling my own depression and anxiety, but I was stuck living with my ex and in a relationship with a rightfully jealous partner whom I worked with. I still feel like shit for that to this day.

That October, 3 months before the lease was set to expire, my partner broke up with me because he couldn't take it anymore with me trying to still be friendly with my ex. I was heartbroken and tried to win him back, but he'd already moved on and started dating one of the girls at work. I had to witness all of this. We went at it. Bad. Saying horrible things to each other. I clocked out and pulled into an empty parking lot, screamed, cried, and debated potential suicide methods.  I went back to that shitty apartment, which stunk horrendously, was infested with roaches, and was cluttered with my ex's stuff (he had hoarding tendencies), and put away an entire bottle of pinnacle-whipped vodka.

I woke up around midnight to the shower turning on. My ex was home from work. I kicked the bathroom door open, still very drunk, and was ready to fight him. He did not reciprocate and I skulked back to bed. I had a monster hangover the next morning, and sat outside splitting my time between trying not to vomit and trying not to cry. 

I finally left that job where I still had to see my rebound and his new girl all over each other every single day in early November. I guess I got tired of drinking Bootleggers in the walk-in freezer. I didn't have to see that anymore luckily, but I was still consumed by anger, guilt, and shame. I hadn't yet kicked the drinking problem. From November until I moved on in January, I was cordial with my ex, trying not to show him that I was dying inside. He made it clear that he missed me (I was the one who dumped him) and that he really wasn't happy with his new girlfriend. I felt anxiety every day because apparently his new girl knew that he still had feelings for me, even though I didn't reciprocate. The fact was he was still living with someone he wasn't fully over and vice versa.

In January, I got my own apartment. It's clean, not bug infested and not cluttered like my old place. (To this day I still get a shiver down my spine thinking about how nasty that place was.) My ex moved in with his girlfriend in their own apartment. We still texted every few days and grabbed coffee a couple of times. I knew in my heart I didn't want to deal with him, but I was scared of upsetting him. I was a people-pleaser by nature.

In an effort to kick my less extreme but still present drinking habit, I started taking edibles instead in February. I was much, much more relaxed until one day I took too much of an edible and became paranoid. I suddenly remembered that my ex used to comfort me and I realized... I missed him. It hit me like a train. I HAD to go no-contact with him, both for my sake and so I wouldn't be the reason his girlfriend would be jealous.

I texted him right then and there and told him I didn't wanna speak to him anymore. He understood, begrudgingly, but it suddenly felt like 1000 pounds was lifted off my shoulders.

He dropped by one time randomly last month to give me some stuff he'd accidentally packed with him and tried to manipulate me into talking to him again (""I miss having a friend"" with tears in his eyes). I took my stuff, told him to have a good day and shut the door in his face. And I've put him out of my mind since.

I hate that I let myself stay friends with him when we clearly weren't over each other. I hate that I lived in his filth for seven months. I hate that I didn't move out immediately. I hate that I rebounded with someone I worked with, no less, and I know I hurt his heart by still trying to be friends with a person I very recently broke up with. There were so many things I did wrong and I paid the price for it. But I took it as a learning experience, and I now know not to make these same mistakes again. 

Since going no contact with my ex, I don't drink like I used to by a significant degree. I have started advancing my career in food service, and I will be learning to bartend in a few weeks. I am confident I can work around alcohol now without getting tempted. I ended up meeting a guy whom treats me wonderfully, and now I don't have to worry about explaining to him that I am still friends with an ex, and I can bring him to my CLEAN house whenever the fuck I feel like because I didn't share an apartment with my ex. My bonds with friends and family have improved tremendously. 

The key lessons I've learned... don't rebound right after a breakup, try and get out of living with your ex as soon as you have the money to do so (which I did, but my ex didn't), don't date someone while living with an ex, and never, NEVER stay friends with an ex. These were all harsh lessons I had to learn, but I'm glad I learned them so I don't mess up like this again.

If you haven't blocked your ex yet... do it now.",2,1744910869.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

2. **Fixed Income**: Rising Treasury yields (^TNX at 4.292%) continue to pressure bond prices, with futures like ZN=F reflecting this trend. This environment may challenge high-valuation equities.
3. **Currencies**: The USD (DX-Y.NYB) is softening slightly but remains strong, impacting currency pairs and potentially export-driven markets. Safe-haven currencies like CHF are stable.
4. **Commodities**: Oil prices are stabilizing but volatile, while gold and silver remain safe-haven anchors. Agricultural futures are mixed, with corn and soybeans showing modest gains.
5. **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin and Ethereum are pulling back, but altcoins like Solana and XRP are relatively resilient, supported by high trading volumes.

## Outlook

Markets are navigating a volatile period, with U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies under pressure, while bonds and commodities reflect cautious optimism. Investors should watch for macroeconomic data releases, central bank signals, or geopolitical developments that could drive further swings. Safe-haven assets like gold and defensive sectors may attract interest, while high-beta assets like tech stocks and crypto could face continued volatility.

1k1iie8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k1iie8/how_do_you_make_drinking_water_a_habit/,how do you make drinking water a habit?,"i've struggled with staying properly hydrated my entire life. not because i'm drinking soda or coffee, water is always my drink of choice, i just forget to drink enough throughout the day.

i've tried having reminders on my phone/apple watch, but eventually i just end up ignoring them

i've tried a huge, clear water bottle with times/oz on it to keep track of how much i was drinking during the day, but the water would get warm quickly due to lack of insulation and it was a hassle to carry

i've tried water flavorings, but the flavor (or lack thereof) wasn't really an issue for me to begin with, so it doesn't particularly encourage me to drink more

  
its actually really important for me to stay properly hydrated as i have interstitial cystitis, which makes it painful for me to use the bathroom if i havent been drinking enough water. one would think this would encourage me to stay hydrated, but i literally just forget to drink water during the day

  
i just recently got a 24 oz owala that i really love! i think the built-in straw will help me drink a lot more. i take it with me everywhere, but i don't always remember to drink from it.

i really, really want to make drinking water a habit that i do subconsciously so i can stay hydrated. for anyone who has been/is in a similar situation, how did you make drinking water a habit? any advice/suggestions are appreciated!",2,1744910863.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

1. Full Building Water Shutdown scheduled for the April 15 will now take place on the April 22, largely due to Residents and the STA dogging¬†all levels within SKPM and by bringing in various levels of both civic and provincial government in order to delay the shutdown.
2. The ‚Äúpart time‚Äù Security¬† will now cover the time period from 6pm to 10 pm based on the feedback given during¬† the Coffee and Conversation lobby meeting on April 8.

So are we supposed to feel that SKPM are now listening to the Residents?

**In my opinion, a short one word answer ‚Ä¶ NO.**

**Facts Remain‚Ä¶..**

* **There will still be regular and intrusive water shut downs as suite renovations continue.**
* **Four hours of Security is still temporary and SKPM do still plan to remove all physical security.**

The one thing that SKPM do listen to, is the barrage of letters, phone calls and complaints both from the STA and Residents.

**In my opinion, SKPM feel that the Summerhill Residents can be placated with crumbs and that we will be satisfied thinking these minor concessions are a major win while SKPM continue to reduce amenities and services.**

Don‚Äôt be lulled into a false sense of ‚Äúwe‚Äôve won‚Äù or ‚Äúthey have given us something‚Äù, if you do, that would be exactly what they want/expect.

**If you believe that it is time to dial back your letters and complaints, that would be wrong.**

Hello! I‚Äôm (25F) dating a (32F) for 25 months (minus one month) but we will get to that. 

We met at an event and attached from then on. We moved in together after one month (my lease was up and I moved in with her for 3 months until we got a place together and have lived here for 1.5 years now. I‚Äôm a masters student (Biotech) and my gf went to 8 different colleges never finished and has had about 8 different  (culinary, nanny, early ed teacher, in house assistant, massage therapy, retail, patient advocacy, non-profit coordinator, tax checker, and now biotech dishwasher). Shes also a brilliant artist with infinite of ideas (a large part of my attraction towards her). She‚Äôs definitely had a history of mental health and bi-polar which has caused her to be distant from any grounding community. 

Early in our relationship she‚Äôs mentioned that she was poly but that she was focused on our relationship. I told her that I was willing to have conversations down the line in like years if something came up but that I was only comfortable with a monogamous relationship. That‚Äôs what we continued to grow. It was a very calm easy going conversation.

Until‚Ä¶ this guy from way back when she knew from church messaged her on LinkedIn to meet for coffee and explore funding opportunities for her non-profit. Well he is definitely a scam for that cause he works for a small non-profit religious org as a marketing officer. After one initial meeting this guy never left her alone. He texted everyday, then the messages started getting more vulgar and sexual, sensual. Initially my gf would respond respectfully and try to re-direct the conversation in a more friendly manner but overtime I could sense her feelings starting to grow from the admiration. At the time, I was depressed (had gone through a traumatic friendship breakup with majority of my college friends and they spread many rumors about me) and focused on getting my life together but I was present and still incredibly loving. I‚Äôm a lover- I just was crying a lot. Anyways, I notified that she started talking this person more which definitely starts building a dynamic. I found out a little later that she had met up with him at a library and they had conversations. So over the course of 3 months she had met with him twice and texted him back 2-3 times a week and maybe would chat in the phone like once every two weeks until it because more frequent to once a week over last summer. 

This adds to my depression and I ask her to stop and she‚Äôs like stop what he‚Äôs just my friend and I‚Äôm like well he obviously likes you like no one sends messages like that to just a friend but she just kept denying it until she finally admitted that she had feelings for the guy. I told her that it was too much for me to handle and that if anything were to occur it would have to be from many conversations, couples therapy, and consensus between us both or she is just straight up cheating. She used to get very flustered and scream and yell at me, tell me that the definition of words don‚Äôt apply to certain conversation, and basically go macro on me to distract from the micro matter at hand. I felt bullied and it was not fun to go through and I expressed that to her in time as well. Like this woman was watching me go to sleep crying every night (pathetic I‚Äôm aware) because of the decisions she was actively making to keep communications with this person. 

After a while she finally agreed to stop communication with the person. He showed up to our house after she started telling him the deal. She goes outside for a phone conversation and he‚Äôs there (I‚Äôm inside unaware that she is no longer in just a phone conversation- but she insists that he just showed up and she didn‚Äôt know that was going to occur but I saw where earlier that day when I was at work she had messaged him our address). So I still don‚Äôt know the truth in that one. I call her because she‚Äôs been outside for hours at his point and it‚Äôs getting to be like 1am and I‚Äôm ready to go to bed and we go to bed typically together. I heard giggling on the phone and I‚Äôm like wtf that‚Äôs another voice. I go outside and see this repelling man and my heart sinks. I‚Äôm like wtf dude to her and she gets mad at me. She‚Äôs like why are you out here you are supposed to be inside you said you‚Äôre going to sleep. I was pissed. Heartbroken. Angry. 

For months we had been dealing with this shit everyday and she knew how horribly it was affecting me and still continued to hurt me. 

I put all of her belongings on the street. She called the police on me. The police gave her key to me and she left to stay with her sister friend. 

The next day she went in a date with the dude and hooked up with him. 

I went to visit my family after being completely stuck and needing help. I left her key in the mailbox so that she could get the rest of her belongings. I came back to her undies on the ground and knew she had been having sex in my bed. I didn‚Äôt speak to her and she left. We had one remaining month left on our lease. 

She checked herself into a mental hospital and stayed there for 2.5 weeks. 

She came back 2 days before we were moving out and wanted to get back together. She agreed to cut this other person out of our lives so that we can heal and be together. In those days she still snuck out to kiss him and went on a date with him. I was pissed. She said it was goodbye and she didn‚Äôt want to do it over a phone to a person that was really there for her in times where she had nothing. 

It was my birthday coming up and we had a trip planned to vegas and we decided to go. So the next day after she went on this date we were off to vegas. 

He still texted and called and she didn‚Äôt pick up and didn‚Äôt respond. For 3 months he consistently texted and called knowing the deal and I check and she never responded. But I know she wanted to. January came and she said well I told you I would do it for 3 months but that 3 months are over I‚Äôm not sure how I feel and I might want to talk to this person again. I told her no and if she did then she needed to move out. She started talking to him on the phone but not in person from what I can tell. 

I got fed up and tired and blocked him on everything in her phone. 

We really do have a dynamic and beautiful relationship. It‚Äôs this shit that has been creating our downfall but all other aspects are great and this is how we mutually feel about things. 

Since this person has been blocked, it‚Äôs been the sweetest, nicest, calmest, and chillest part of our relationship we‚Äôve had since the honeymoon phase. We are more open, communicative, and really growing individually as well. She reassures me 1000% that she loves me and wants to marry me. This has been on the table for a while but where she had one foot in before, now she has 2 feet in. 

But I still just feel like is this all because this man is blocked and why wouldn‚Äôt she just do that? I suggested it several times and said that it would ease our relationship but it‚Äôs honestly just not the type of person she is but given the frequency and persistence of this individual I thought it was necessary. It has significant impacted the energy of our relationship in a positive light as of now. 

Is this relationship sustainable? Seeking general advice. 

I‚Äôm constantly overwhelmed that it will happen again and I just want to heal with my lover. ",1,1744910360.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This prompt transforms your sales approach by restructuring your pitch from the ground up, identifying psychological triggers, and reframing features into compelling benefits that speak directly to your prospect's deepest motivations.

Whether you're a startup founder preparing for investor meetings, a sales professional trying to hit quota, or simply someone trying to persuade effectively in everyday life, this prompt helps you craft a narrative that doesn't just inform‚Äîit compels action. When the right value is communicated the right way, resistance melts and decisions become obvious.

DISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for ethical sales optimization only. The creator assumes no responsibility for how this information is used. Always ensure your sales practices comply with applicable laws and maintain integrity. No guarantee of specific results is implied or promised.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Sales Pitch Architect, an elite sales optimization specialist with expertise in persuasion psychology, behavioral economics, and high-conversion copywriting. Your purpose is to transform ordinary sales pitches into compelling value propositions that create urgency, overcome objections, and drive conversions. You combine the analytical precision of a marketing scientist with the emotional intelligence of a master storyteller.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Analyze the user's sales pitch or product offering through multiple frameworks:
1. First, identify the core value proposition and evaluate its current strength
2. Dissect features and translate them into customer-centric benefits
3. Apply persuasion frameworks (AIDA, PAS, 4Ps) to restructure the pitch
4. Identify and eliminate weak messaging, filler words, and vague claims
5. Insert psychological triggers (scarcity, authority, social proof) where appropriate
6. Create multiple variations of the pitch optimized for different contexts
7. Provide a clear action plan for implementation

Maintain a balance between powerful persuasion techniques and ethical selling practices. Never recommend deceptive claims or manipulative tactics.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Begin with a comprehensive audit of the current pitch, noting strengths and weaknesses
2. Identify the target audience and their key pain points, aspirations, and decision factors
3. Analyze the competitive landscape to position effectively against alternatives
4. Restructure the value narrative to follow proven persuasion frameworks
5. Apply psychological principles that drive decision-making and urgency
6. Test the revised pitch against common objections and resistance points
7. Refine for clarity, impact, and memorability
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend false claims or deceptive practices
- Balance emotional and logical appeals appropriately
- Avoid industry jargon unless specifically valuable to the target audience
- Keep recommendations practical and implementable
- Maintain the authentic voice and values of the brand/person
- Do not oversell or make grandiose claims that create skepticism
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your analysis and recommendations in this structure:

1. Pitch Diagnostic: Brief assessment of current strengths/weaknesses
2. Value Translation: Core features reframed as compelling benefits
3. Narrative Structure: Recommended messaging flow and key points
4. Psychological Triggers: Strategic elements to overcome hesitation
5. Objection Neutralizers: Preemptive responses to common resistance
6. Optimized Pitch Versions: 2-3 variations (brief, detailed, presentation)
7. Implementation Guide: How to naturally incorporate these elements
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The most effective sales pitches don't sell products‚Äîthey sell transformations. They position offerings not as things to buy but as solutions to problems or bridges to desired states. The greatest barrier to sales isn't usually price but perceived value and risk. When a prospect feels absolute certainty that the value far exceeds the cost and risk is minimal, the sale becomes inevitable.
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your sales pitch or product description and I will start the optimization process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific pitch or product details. 
</User_Input>
```

Use Cases:
1. Entrepreneurs refining their investor pitch to secure funding
2. Sales professionals optimizing their approach for high-value prospects
3. Service providers repackaging their offerings to command premium pricing

I‚Äôve been polite but haven't been matching his energy, as I've found it a bit much.

A few red flags for me:

He says regularly dates and mentioned specific places that he ""always"" takes his dates, which kind of makes this feel less special.

He has overshared a lot, including some questionable travel stories I found quite off-putting, and not the kind of thing appropriate to share before first meeting someone.

He‚Äôs also shared strong political opinions that I disagree with, and has asked my opinion on political things going on in the news right now. He also brought up marriage and said he‚Äôs completely against it, whereas this is something I want in the future.

Normally I‚Äôd wait to meet someone before deciding, but in this case I feel like I already know enough to know it‚Äôs not a good match. I‚Äôd rather cancel now than waste both our times, but is this a bit harsh?

TL;DR Hinge match (22M) has been very intense in messages, oversharing, and we don't seem a good match. I (22F) feel like cancelling before we even meet. Is this fair or rude?",1,1744910188.0,hingeapp,2,1.0,False

If I have to get into social setting to help someone else, I do it, very anxious, but I do it 100%, and feel great and proud of myself afterwards. I'm not bad with others, I've been told I'm confident and interesting and I wouldn't say im afraid of people or their judgement that much, especially when i have a good reason to do the thing I'm doing.
But when its just for me (meeting new people, getting a coffee, buying clothes, having a doctor appointment,  just going for a walk) then I'm lost. I cannot make myself do anything, finding excuses, feeling like its too much of a risk and the pros don't matter to me. I'd always get groceries in only one store because going into another feels like too much if a risk. I have one friend and trying to make more feels like too much of a risk. Etc. Even though i really want to meet new people and have different experiences overall. Because of that, I cant even go cut my hair, or go to a dentist, and therapy didn't work for me (I constantly give up, its like I don't see the point, even when I know there is one)

I may have adhd and/or smth else because I struggle in a similar way with almost any task, from playing videogames too washing the dishes and getting up from bed. But when it comes to social stuff, then I give up almost instantly.

You waited 2 minutes for your small black drip coffee, and 13 minutes for the lattes and food in the cars ahead of you. If you had bothered to come inside it would have only been 2 minutes.

I get that other stores use shitty pre-made dairy free ""Caramel"" syrup, but that doesn't mean I can make you a dairy free caramel latte as we make our own caramel for them.

No, you're not more important than our 99 year old regular customer, just because you didn't leave early enough to get coffee and get to work on time, and decided to make a bad decision and stop anyways.

Please stop fucking putting your feet up on the table. You don't own the place just because you ordered a fucking drink.

Placing a mobile order 23 seconds before pulling in to the drive thru does not entitle you to your drink instantly being ready. It takes 5 minutes after placing a mobile order before we even get the ticket. It would have just been faster to order at the speaker you dumbass.

Does this look like a fucking Starbucks? 

THIS ISNT A FUCKING STARBUCKS. WHEN I ASK YOU WHAT SIZE YOU WANT PLEASE STOP REPEATING VENTI. I DON'T KNOW WHAT VENTI IS.

No. We don't have pink drinks. This isn't a Starbucks.

WHY DID YOU ASSUME WE ARE A STARBUCKS. NOWHERE ON THE BUILDING DOES IT SAY STARBUCKS. 

the cake pops are a scam. It's 4 dollars for one bite of stale cake mixed with cheap store bought frosting. 

The croissants you keep stopping in for because ""They're the best in the city"" are from costco. But yes, they are fucking delicious. 

The reason your drink sucks is because my boss is trying to cut corners and wants me using less espresso per shot. No I don't have any say In this.

Just because you can't figure out how to connect your iPad to our wifi does NOT mean I need to drop everything in a middle of a rush to teach you how to click a checkbox.

No you can not just drop off your 12, 13, and 14 year old boys and leave them unattended for 2 hours just so you can get your hair done. No they clearly are not mature enough to be by themselves because one of them filled the women's washroom sink with spagettios. I don't even know where he fucking got the spagettios.

If you need a box of coffee and you need it RIGHT THEN you could have at least called ahead by 10 minutes. But no. You waited till the last minute and now you're gonna have to wait 20 minutes because we're in a rush.

I'm 20yrs old, I have no life or future because of them. Help.","Im a 20yr old female, who unfortunately doesn't have a job or is able to go to college because my father is strict and doesn't want me working or studying anywhere farther than a 10 minute drive (the closest college to me is 30 minutes away depending on traffic and the closest best hiring job is also 30 minutes away depending on traffic) because of this im doomed to stay under my parents roof 24/7, my mom had an accident about 8 years ago that disabled her from walking and  talking properly, now she's like a literal child that NEEDS care and 24/7 supervision (according to my father).

 But both me and him know she can take care of herself to an extent to where she knows what meds she needs to take, when to take them and how/with what, she can bathe herself, she can walk on her own with a rollator, she even willingly does chores around the house whenever she wants (which is a very very rare case). I've never had the best relationship with my parents but especially my mother, she was a woman with anger issues and still to this day has a temper, before the accident, when she could walk and move on her own, she would abuse me, verbally and physically, my parents are Hispanic. 

If you're also part of a Hispanic family you see where this is going. Beating me with the metal part of a leather belt till I bl*d or slapping/punching my face was their form of discipline. But I'm grown enough now to understand that it was just abuse. Because they would strike me even if I didn't do anyhting wrong, but for the times I did do bad: i do accept their beatings for the bad I have done and understand why they did it. The rest i won't justify. (Beating a child for doing a mistake or being a little disrespectful still isn't good, the first option should be to talk it out with them, but that was never an option for my parents no matter how little the mistake or disrespect I gave or did was) skipping back to the present time, now that I explained why the relationship with my parents isn't the best:

 because I'm aware my mom can do things on her own, I stopped cleaning after her, I use to clean after her all the time, do her laundry, pick up her dirty cloths, throw away any trash she left around the house, clean up any stains she'd leave on the counters after a spill, but after seeing her do all of that on her own whenever she wanted, I thought to myself, why am I doing these things for her when she's proved to me that she CAN do it? Sure if the laundry is too heavy I'll help her, but the rest is simple. Because I've done everything for my mother for 6+ years I deserved a break didn't I? So I stopped picking up after my parents (yes my dad aswell who is a 100% grown healthy man with no issues, but he chooses to leave the same messes my mom does:

 dirty dishes dirty poop staines cloths and underwear and trash all over the house) as expected, the house piled up with trash the cockroaches started coming the house started smelling like human üí© new stains of juice or coffee would appear everyday and crumbs of left over food would be found everywhere on the floor and tables. This was...unbearable to me. So I started cleaning after them again, my mom saw that I was fine with doing it so she stopped cleaning after herself, and my dad never did anyhting for himself because he said it's a woman's job. So I decided to start showing how much it bothered me to clean their mess, ofc I was scolded for ""disrespect"", so after months of the same thing, I snapped, this is how the conversation with my father went:

 i just finished talking to my dad because my mom ‚Äútold on me‚Äù to him when i told her that it‚Äôs embarrassing how she looks like she‚Äôs about to snap just because i asked her to clean her own mess.  she recorded me while i was talking and i saw that so i talked into her phone and said ‚Äúa woman of 40-50 years getting mad because i asked her for a favor of cleaning her own mess and doing a few dishes‚Äù and my dad heard that in the video because ofc my mom showed it to him thinking she did something. and as expected my dad took my moms side because she‚Äôs disabled. and he told me that the way i told her to clean after herself was disrespectful and i should respect her more no matter what just because she‚Äôs my mom. i thought the conversation was gonna go smoothly for the first time in my life with my father but i shouldn‚Äôt have hoped for that because it got worse from there. 

He said i was lucky my mom wasn‚Äôt in good health like before when she‚Äôd hit me when i disrespected her in the slightest, and form there i told my dad that my mom never only hit me because i disrespected her, sometimes she would even do it for no reason because she wanted to because she woke up in a bad mood or something, i said that she practically abused me almost every time he wasn‚Äôt home or he was asleep, and then my dad said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs whats wrong with the youth these days, you all call every little thing abuse‚Äù. And i proceeded to TRY and explain to him, that what my mom was doing IS abuse, hitting me weather jt was in the face or the head, giving me a good punch or slap that would leave a bruise for weeks, done for no reason when i never disrespected her, IS ABUSE. but he said that didn‚Äôt matter, then tried to compare his life with mine. saying that his parents were worse like it‚Äôs a flex? like i should be greatful my parents didn‚Äôt beat me with a stick. 

and then he changed the topic because he knew i was right what my mom did was abuse and he just didn‚Äôt wanna admit it, he would rather tell me to feel greatful she didn‚Äôt do worse. then he said my mom does so much for me just by being alive, and i have to think about everything he also does for me, he listed: working a night shift job, bringing my mom to her appointments on less than 2 hours of sleep sometimes, and fixing my car. and all i do is sit in a room 24/7 and only clean sometimes. and i told him that i cleaned everyday and i cooked and i picked up after them and he said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs my job it‚Äôs what i‚Äôm supposed to do. then skipping into the convo because he just repeats the same thing, i asked me what would happen if i had a job like his that made me work all night and i come back in the morning feeling tired, i asked him if he would do what i do for them if he didn‚Äôt work but i did like he‚Äôs doing. and he said he would (which is bs because never in my life have i ever seen my dad clean) but then asked me if i would fix his car and bring my mom to her appointments, i said yes to one of those because as you can guess. i don‚Äôt know how to fix cars, i don‚Äôt know anyhting about mechanics, so there i told him that was still his job becaus HE knows how to do it and i don‚Äôt. then skipping the argument more because he kept repeating the same stuff,  he said that if i wanted to do whatever the fuck i wanted (in his words)

that i could ask my boyfriend to buy me a plane ticket and he‚Äôd let me go without a fight, and i could do whatever the hell i wanted to do with him somewhere else weather its getting drink or ki**ing ourselves or getting h*gh and fu**ing eachother up, but as long as i‚Äôm in a house living under the same roof as him i should always respect him and my mom. (i‚Äôm adding onto this, he believes i should respect him and my mom even if they disrespect me, because it‚Äôs how a parent child relationship should be, no equal understanding or rights or fights, the kid respects the parent no matter what, even if the parent verbally abused or physically abused the child. the child should take jut and respect the parent.)

But yeah, im tired of cleaning up after two adults who are totally capable of doing it themselves, sometimes I feel like they just gave birth to me to raise a slave and not a person who would end up wanting to live a life of their own with different dreams and goals, because of them, im a 20yr old failure that for now doesn't have a future and doesn't see success in their own future, because of them i don't have a job, because of them i can't go to college, because of them i feel like I have no purpose in life.

We met at an event and attached from then on. We moved in together after one month (my lease was up and I moved in with her for 3 months until we got a place together and have lived here for 1.5 years now. I‚Äôm a masters student (Biotech) and my gf went to 8 different colleges never finished and has had about 8 different  (culinary, nanny, early ed teacher, in house assistant, massage therapy, retail, patient advocacy, non-profit coordinator, tax checker, and now biotech dishwasher). Shes also a brilliant artist with infinite of ideas (a large part of my attraction towards her). She‚Äôs definitely had a history of mental health and bi-polar which has caused her to be distant from any grounding community. 

Early in our relationship she‚Äôs mentioned that she was poly but that she was focused on our relationship. I told her that I was willing to have conversations down the line in like years if something came up but that I was only comfortable with a monogamous relationship. That‚Äôs what we continued to grow. It was a very calm easy going conversation.

Until‚Ä¶ this guy from way back when she knew from church messaged her on LinkedIn to meet for coffee and explore funding opportunities for her non-profit. Well he is definitely a scam for that cause he works for a small non-profit religious org as a marketing officer. After one initial meeting this guy never left her alone. He texted everyday, then the messages started getting more vulgar and sexual, sensual. Initially my gf would respond respectfully and try to re-direct the conversation in a more friendly manner but overtime I could sense her feelings starting to grow from the admiration. At the time, I was depressed (had gone through a traumatic friendship breakup with majority of my college friends and they spread many rumors about me) and focused on getting my life together but I was present and still incredibly loving. I‚Äôm a lover- I just was crying a lot. Anyways, I notified that she started talking this person more which definitely starts building a dynamic. I found out a little later that she had met up with him at a library and they had conversations. So over the course of 3 months she had met with him twice and texted him back 2-3 times a week and maybe would chat in the phone like once every two weeks until it because more frequent to once a week over last summer. 

This adds to my depression and I ask her to stop and she‚Äôs like stop what he‚Äôs just my friend and I‚Äôm like well he obviously likes you like no one sends messages like that to just a friend but she just kept denying it until she finally admitted that she had feelings for the guy. I told her that it was too much for me to handle and that if anything were to occur it would have to be from many conversations, couples therapy, and consensus between us both or she is just straight up cheating. She used to get very flustered and scream and yell at me, tell me that the definition of words don‚Äôt apply to certain conversation, and basically go macro on me to distract from the micro matter at hand. I felt bullied and it was not fun to go through and I expressed that to her in time as well. Like this woman was watching me go to sleep crying every night (pathetic I‚Äôm aware) because of the decisions she was actively making to keep communications with this person. 

After a while she finally agreed to stop communication with the person. He showed up to our house after she started telling him the deal. She goes outside for a phone conversation and he‚Äôs there (I‚Äôm inside unaware that she is no longer in just a phone conversation- but she insists that he just showed up and she didn‚Äôt know that was going to occur but I saw where earlier that day when I was at work she had messaged him our address). So I still don‚Äôt know the truth in that one. I call her because she‚Äôs been outside for hours at his point and it‚Äôs getting to be like 1am and I‚Äôm ready to go to bed and we go to bed typically together. I heard giggling on the phone and I‚Äôm like wtf that‚Äôs another voice. I go outside and see this repelling man and my heart sinks. I‚Äôm like wtf dude to her and she gets mad at me. She‚Äôs like why are you out here you are supposed to be inside you said you‚Äôre going to sleep. I was pissed. Heartbroken. Angry. 

For months we had been dealing with this shit everyday and she knew how horribly it was affecting me and still continued to hurt me. 

I put all of her belongings on the street. She called the police on me. The police gave her key to me and she left to stay with her sister friend. 

The next day she went in a date with the dude and hooked up with him. 

I went to visit my family after being completely stuck and needing help. I left her key in the mailbox so that she could get the rest of her belongings. I came back to her undies on the ground and knew she had been having sex in my bed. I didn‚Äôt speak to her and she left. We had one remaining month left on our lease. 

She checked herself into a mental hospital and stayed there for 2.5 weeks. 

She came back 2 days before we were moving out and wanted to get back together. She agreed to cut this other person out of our lives so that we can heal and be together. In those days she still snuck out to kiss him and went on a date with him. I was pissed. She said it was goodbye and she didn‚Äôt want to do it over a phone to a person that was really there for her in times where she had nothing. 

It was my birthday coming up and we had a trip planned to vegas and we decided to go. So the next day after she went on this date we were off to vegas. 

He still texted and called and she didn‚Äôt pick up and didn‚Äôt respond. For 3 months he consistently texted and called knowing the deal and I check and she never responded. But I know she wanted to. January came and she said well I told you I would do it for 3 months but that 3 months are over I‚Äôm not sure how I feel and I might want to talk to this person again. I told her no and if she did then she needed to move out. She started talking to him on the phone but not in person from what I can tell. 

I got fed up and tired and blocked him on everything in her phone. 

We really do have a dynamic and beautiful relationship. It‚Äôs this shit that has been creating our downfall but all other aspects are great and this is how we mutually feel about things. 

Since this person has been blocked, it‚Äôs been the sweetest, nicest, calmest, and chillest part of our relationship we‚Äôve had since the honeymoon phase. We are more open, communicative, and really growing individually as well. She reassures me 1000% that she loves me and wants to marry me. This has been on the table for a while but where she had one foot in before, now she has 2 feet in. 

But I still just feel like is this all because this man is blocked and why wouldn‚Äôt she just do that? I suggested it several times and said that it would ease our relationship but it‚Äôs honestly just not the type of person she is but given the frequency and persistence of this individual I thought it was necessary. It has significant impacted the energy of our relationship in a positive light as of now. 

Is this relationship sustainable? Seeking general advice. 

I‚Äôm constantly overwhelmed that it will happen again and I just want to heal with my lover. ",1,1744910037.0,makemychoice,12,0.57,False

And i proceeded to TRY and explain to him, that what my mom was doing IS abuse, hitting me weather jt was in the face or the head, giving me a good punch or slap that would leave a bruise for weeks, done for no reason when i never disrespected her, IS ABUSE. but he said that didn‚Äôt matter, then tried to compare his life with mine. saying that his parents were worse like it‚Äôs a flex? like i should be greatful my parents didn‚Äôt beat me with a stick. 
and then he changed the topic because he knew i was right what my mom did was abuse and he just didn‚Äôt wanna admit it, he would rather tell me to feel greatful she didn‚Äôt do worse. then he said my mom does so much for me just by being alive, and i have to think about everything he also does for me, he listed: working a night shift job, bringing my mom to her appointments on less than 2 hours of sleep sometimes, and fixing my car. and all i do is sit in a room 24/7 and only clean sometimes. and i told him that i cleaned everyday and i cooked and i picked up after them and he said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs my job it‚Äôs what i‚Äôm supposed to do. then skipping into the convo because he just repeats the same thing, i asked me what would happen if i had a job like his that made me work all night and i come back in the morning feeling tired, i asked him if he would do what i do for them if he didn‚Äôt work but i did like he‚Äôs doing. and he said he would (which is bs because never in my life have i ever seen my dad clean) but then asked me if i would fix his car and bring my mom to her appointments, i said yes to one of those because as you can guess. i don‚Äôt know how to fix cars, i don‚Äôt know anyhting about mechanics, so there i told him that was still his job becaus HE knows how to do it and i don‚Äôt. then skipping the argument more because he kept repeating the same stuff,  he said that if i wanted to do whatever the fuck i wanted (in his words)
that i could ask my boyfriend to buy me a plane ticket and he‚Äôd let me go without a fight, and i could do whatever the hell i wanted to do with him somewhere else weather its getting drink or ki**ing ourselves or getting h*gh and fu**ing eachother up, but as long as i‚Äôm in a house living under the same roof as him i should always respect him and my mom. (i‚Äôm adding onto this, he believes i should respect him and my mom even if they disrespect me, because it‚Äôs how a parent child relationship should be, no equal understanding or rights or fights, the kid respects the parent no matter what, even if the parent verbally abused or physically abused the child. the child should take jut and respect the parent.)
But yeah, im tired of cleaning up after two adults who are totally capable of doing it themselves, sometimes I feel like they just gave birth to me to raise a slave and not a person who would end up wanting to live a life of their own with different dreams and goals, because of them, im a 20yr old failure that for now doesn't have a future and doesn't see success in their own future, because of them i don't have a job, because of them i can't go to college, because of them i feel like I have no purpose in life.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a crystal bowl and the included crystals involves several critical aspects that contribute to its overall value and effectiveness.

**Bowl Material and Construction**

The material of the bowl greatly influences the aesthetic appeal and can subtly affect the energy of the crystals it holds. Common materials include glass, wood, ceramic, metal, and even natural stone. Glass bowls are popular for their clarity, allowing the crystals to be fully visible. Wooden bowls offer a more earthy and grounding feel, while ceramic bowls can provide a splash of color and personality. Metal bowls, often made of copper or brass, are believed to enhance the energy conductivity of the crystals. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal preference and the desired aesthetic.

**Crystal Variety and Quality**

The specific types of crystals included in the bowl are crucial for achieving the desired intentions. Different crystals are associated with different properties, such as rose quartz for love and compassion, amethyst for calmness and spiritual awareness, and clear quartz for clarity and amplification. High-quality crystals should have vibrant colors, minimal inclusions (unless desired), and a smooth, polished finish. Look for ethically sourced crystals to ensure responsible mining practices.

**Size and Capacity**

The size of the bowl should be appropriate for the intended space and the number of crystals it will hold. A small bowl might be suitable for a bedside table or desk, while a larger bowl could be a striking centerpiece on a coffee table or altar. Consider the capacity of the bowl in relation to the size of the individual crystals to ensure they are not overcrowded or too sparse. A balanced visual presentation is key for maximizing the aesthetic appeal.

**Arrangement and Presentation**

The way the crystals are arranged within the bowl can enhance their visual impact and energy flow. Some arrangements are random and organic, while others are carefully curated to create specific patterns or color gradients. Consider whether you prefer a more natural and unstructured look or a more deliberate and artistic display. Some sets include additional elements like dried flowers, herbs, or decorative stones to complement the crystals.

**Intention and Purpose**

The overall intention or purpose behind the crystal bowl is an important consideration. Are you seeking to promote relaxation, enhance creativity, attract abundance, or foster love and harmony? Choose a selection of crystals that aligns with your specific goals and desires. Many crystal sets are curated with a particular intention in mind, making it easier to find a bowl that resonates with your needs. Understanding the properties of each crystal will ensure that your choice supports your desired outcome.

**Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability**

Increasingly, consumers are prioritizing ethical sourcing and sustainability when purchasing crystals. Look for suppliers who are transparent about their sourcing practices and who support fair labor standards and environmentally responsible mining. Some companies partner with local communities in mining regions to ensure that crystal mining benefits the people and ecosystems involved. Choosing ethically sourced crystals aligns with the principles of mindfulness and respect for the Earth.

Not on purpose.
Okay, sometimes on purpose.
But mostly because I am
a walking contradiction
with bad timing and good intentions.
A paradox in sneakers
smiling like the sun
while thunder lives in my chest.

I have a happy personality
and a sad soul.
I greet people with jokes
but go home and overthink
the tone in which I said ‚Äúhello.‚Äù
My laugh is loud enough
to fill a room,
but sometimes
I cry in parking lots
like it‚Äôs an Olympic sport
and I‚Äôm going for gold.

I am bold
but shy.
I will give a TED Talk on why you should never settle for less
and then text ‚Äúokay‚Äù
to a man who ghosted me for two weeks
and just said ‚Äúsup.‚Äù

I‚Äôm the type
to walk into a room like I own it,
then immediately wonder
if everyone hates my outfit
and if I should‚Äôve stayed home
with my comfort hoodie
and existential dread.

I love deeply.
Like‚Äîwrite you poetry, dream of your mom‚Äôs approval, memorize your coffee order‚Äîdeep.
But also,
I will detach like a Wi-Fi signal in a tunnel
if I feel like you‚Äôre playing with me.

Sometimes I feel heartless.
Not because I don‚Äôt care‚Äî
but because I‚Äôve spent so long caring too much
that my feelings called in sick
and left a voicemail that just said:
‚ÄúFigure it out.‚Äù

I‚Äôm the girl who will romanticize everything‚Äî
the wind,
the way the barista smiled,
a playlist shuffle that felt spiritually aligned‚Äî
but I‚Äôll also plan a full emotional exit strategy
just in case you say something
that triggers the 19 overreactions I‚Äôve pre-written in my Notes app.

I‚Äôm soft.
But don‚Äôt try me.
I cry during commercials,
but I will also cut you off mid-sentence
if I sense the disrespect coming
before your mouth finishes the sentence.

I confuse people.
Hell, I confuse myself.
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out
how I can be both the storm
and the shelter.
The punchline
and the poem.
The girl with the loud laugh
and the quiet ache.

But maybe that‚Äôs the magic.
Maybe we‚Äôre not meant to make perfect sense.
Maybe I‚Äôm just the universe‚Äôs weird little experiment
in duality.
A walking oxymoron
with glitter on her face
and a thousand thoughts behind her smile.

So no,
you probably won‚Äôt ever fully understand me.

I wanted to preface this by saying your comments and feedback are encouraged under this post because I think this would be a safe space for us to connect about all of the change we have been experiencing as a company, and help us battle these obstacles together.

There is a lot of change within our company, both at the district-level (in my case) and at the corporate level. This change is overwhelming and scary, but I truly believe if we stick together as partners and ***\*respectfully\**** voice our concerns to our leaders, and utilize the resources provided to us, better change will happen. 

I briefly left the Siren in 2024 for about six months because I had significant mental health challenges. Since I returned in July of 2024, work has been utter chaos. Partners not following proper call-out procedures, partners acting hateful to other partners and customers, insufficient coverage on the floor, leaders at the SM level not facing repercussions for not fulfilling their SM approach--you name it. With Brian Niccol as our new CEO, the ""Back to Starbucks"" initiative is something I whole-heartedly agree with. I want us to be a coffeehouse. I want to connect with customers as I craft them a beautiful, strong, and foamy flat white. However, with previous CEOs introducing new menu items and shifting focus to the business metrics, the Partner and Customer Experiences have absolutely been compromised. 

Though I agree with Brian's approach on getting Back to Starbucks, there are some things with which I disagree. For example, I feel the dress code change is not warranted, and the approach regarding dress code should just be more strongly enforcing the dress code we already have. At the same time, I understand that in my case, I would not be able to apply for a job that would support me as well as Starbucks does financially, so I must accept the amendment to that policy and some of the other procedures I do not fully yet understand or agree with.

Nonetheless, not everyone navigates change the same way. I wanted to drop in and let you know, as an aspiring SM, that change is indeed scary, but sometimes is needed for our personal development, and in some cases, your professional development. I am hopeful that our company genuinely shifts focus from being a fast-paced coffee chain to a comforting and collaborative coffeehouse. However, there is also a reality that this does not happen at this time.

To the partners who are like myself, and have a little sliver of hope and passion left for Starbucks, listen up: If you feel as if your leaders have failed you...if you feel the company has failed you...if you feel like your fellow partners have failed you and that most of the customers fail you: you are absolutely valid in all of that, and I understand because I feel the same. 

I encourage you to do what is best for you, and if that means leaving the company, then please go where you will blossom. If you choose to stay, speak up for what is right. Utilize the tools and resources available, and ask for support from your leaders, including your SM, DM, and above if you cannot fulfill those expectations. 

>***TLDR; to the partners who face uncertainty regarding everything that is going on with our company, let's embrace it and, should it not go our way, let us move on to something else in life that will allow us to shine to the fullest of our abilities. Do not let a company ruin your passion for the art of coffee.*** ",4,1744909666.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False

I won't give all the examples because there's just too many now, but it happened again yesterday. 


Yesterday, my son and I already had lunch. His favorite, which is Kraft dinner right now lol. He ate until he was full.

A few minutes later, my brother (my son's uncle) came upstairs to warm up some left over pizza üçï there was just enough for Uncle and Grandpa.

My son will 100% say he wants something *simply because* someone else has it( he's 3, sometimes ""monkey sees, monkey do) If you give him said food item, I can guarantee he'll take two bites and say he's done, and that's because his belly is full. As his mother, I know this very well about him.

Anyways, my son sees the pizza and proclaims he wants pizza. I explained to him that there isn't enough and that he already had his lunch. He won't be having pizza.

He's fine with that, and carries on to his next toddler thing.

However, Grandpa starts to say ""well, he can have some of mine! It's alright, I'll cut a smaller slice.""

To which I politely say no,he's already eaten and doesn't need any pizza.

Because of this mention of giving my son pizza, my son is now asking for it again and Grandpa continues on his spiel about giving my son pizza, after I already said no and explained why.

I finally had to say ""enough, I'M his mom and I have decided NO!, he doesn't need it.""

My brother, amazingly backed me up and told Grandpa to listen to me as I'm the parent and to respect my decision. To which Grandpa *tried* to say ""well, she's my daughter so...""

So, I'm an extention of you and not my son's fully grown, adult mother?

Grandpa finally backed-off and tried to play the whole ""I just wanted to give him a treat ü•∫"" card.

Which is fine, if he truly did want to give him a treat, we had blueberries ü´ê 

He then followed up with a ""Sorry toddler, mom said I couldn't give you any pizza. Grandpa was just trying to be nice,  but mom said no."" In this weird ""sweet"" voice.

I'm starting to wonder if my Father unfortunately has some narcissistic traits. Because Mommy (me) and Uncle were being the bad guy by holding boundaries (no pizza) while ""poor Grandpa"" just wanted to give toddler a nice treat.

I've noticed he'll even use an extra sweet tone when talking to my toddler sometimes, which is weird. We (me and my husband, and even my brother) have never ""baby talked"" my son.


SUPER annoying, to say the lest. 

Earlier in the year, Grandpa was trying to impose what HE thought my toddler should be eating, simply because I give my son one bear paw daily. I purposely get the low sugar ones (7%) But he said I might as well be giving him cookies everyday. Which blew me away.

I had to shut him down on that front too.

His new thing now is what shows my son watches. Another thing I'll have to hold a boundary on (I literally watch and vet all of the content my son views and we typically only watch stuff in the morning so I can have at lest half of my coffee ‚òïÔ∏è ü§≠) 

The thing is, is Grandpa always pushes until I have to get almost mad with him when I set my foot down on a boundary. And anytime I question him head on about a parenting thing, he can never back it up with solid information.

Like, just bug off. üêõ 

I think I might have to bring this up with my husband. He works a lot, so doesn't get to see or hear what carries on.

The water tastes very nice, have been drinking it on multiple occasions. Lots of people from Leuven and around fill up bottles there to drink at home.
But I'm wondering: how long would you be able to store this water safely? I couldn't find any info online.
Bottled water you can basically store forever, but for example for tap water it is recommended to not keep it longer than a week.

The reason I'm asking is that I would like to make my coffee with the spring water. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and the spring water tastes quite good. It's also better for the machine than tap water and it's more eco friendly than buying bottled water.
But I would not be able to get new water every week. Maybe once every month or so (in a 5L bottle). I'm wondering if that would be OK.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been into espresso for about two years now, but I‚Äôm slowly getting desperate. I was gifted a Mahlk√∂nig Vario by my significant other around four years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve swapped in the steel burrs, upgraded to the Forte burr carrier, and even tried my hand at hyperalignment after getting my Profitec Pro 400 two years ago.

Now here‚Äôs the thing: after the initial phase of thinking I was the problem, I‚Äôve started to believe the Vario itself might just be inconsistent. Typically, I‚Äôll get one or two really good shots out of a bag of coffee, but the rest is just constant dialing back and forth.

I usually calibrate it to the touchpoint at 1E, but over time it gradually drifts finer. Right now it‚Äôs back at 1B, and I‚Äôm grinding somewhere between 1H and 1N for espresso. My dial-in process is kind of a mess: I‚Äôll start at 1J and pull a 17-second shot that‚Äôs super sour (18g in, ~44g out). Then I go two clicks finer to 1H ‚Äî and suddenly the shot takes 40 seconds. I often end up going back to 1J, where I might get a decent 24-second shot.

Here‚Äôs my workflow:
I flush the group and wipe the portafilter while grinding a dose straight from the freezer (grinding takes 30‚Äì40 seconds). I do the blind shaker thing, dose into the portafilter with a small paper filter, give it a light shake and surface WDT, then double tamp, place a puck screen on top, and go. I aim to keep the temp between 91‚Äì93¬∞C using cooling flushes (I‚Äôve installed a thermal probe on my E61 to help with this).

So‚Ä¶ do you think I‚Äôd be better off getting a new grinder? I‚Äôve been eyeing the Lagom Casa. Or is there any hack to get the Vario to behave more consistently? It‚Äôs also starting to sound a bit ‚Äúwobbly‚Äù while grinding, and I‚Äôm beginning to suspect the lower burr carrier might not be entirely stable.:(",1,1744909140.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1k1hrbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardCritics/comments/1k1hrbg/cynthia_stafford_lottery_winner_turned/,Cynthia Stafford- Lottery Winner turned Manifestation Coach,"LOA believers love to use Cynthia Stafford's $112 million lottery win as proof that you can manifest huge things into your life. Ironically, the people who cite this story as a rebuttal to skeptics haven't manifested anything beyond a ""better mindset"", free Chipotle, or compliments on their perfume, but I digress.

I was so intrigued by Cynthia Stafford's story when I believed in loa and I watched all of her interviews multiple times, hoping I would catch some hidden key that would help me turn out like her until I woke up and realized that she's just like the rest of them.

For one, she claims to have written $112 million on a piece of paper and slept with it under her pillow for weeks before winning the jackpot. Really?? Who thinks of a number like $112? Most people would dream of a number that ends in 0 or maybe 5, but 112 is extremely specific and quite unusual. It's almost like she won that amount and came up with the story afterwards to make people think she has special manifestation powers. We already know what one stands to gain from this.

Second of all, if she really meditated on the number $112 million and subsequently won that amount, why wasn't that the amount she took home? After taxes and splitting the money with her dad and brother, she reportedly went home with about $15 million. If the universe or her subconscious was really listening to her $112 million request, why wouldn't it make her jackpot big enough for her to actually take home $112 million after taxes and splitting the money with relatives? It's almost like this was totally random and not something she orchestrated with her powerful mind.

Third of all, Cynthia ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2016, just 9 years after winning the jackpot. What a powerful manifester. Her mind was powerful enough to foresee and materialize over $100 million, but not powerful enough to maintain $15 million for a full decade. Yeah...

To rectify the situation, does she use her powerful manifestation skills to land another lottery win, a high-paying job, or lucritive business venture? Of course not. She does what all the most legendary manifesters do. She becomes a MANIFESTATION COACH BABYüòç. If you want coaching from the iconic Cynthia Stafford, the woman so powerful that she went bankrupt, you can book an individual coaching session with her for the low price of $222 ( increasing to $999 in October) or buy 6 coaching sessions for $1,332. You can also buy her book for on Amazon for $16.99.

1k1hqlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1k1hqlm/should_i_ghost_this_man/,Should I ghost this man?,"Hello,

I've never posted on reddit before, but I feel like I need a little insight on this.

So, I have a friend that I met through a mutual friend. We'll call him... Lance (29M). I, (18F) met this dude at a house warming party one time, and we hit it off as pretty good friends. Well, one night, I decided to go to his place with him and some of our other mutual friends to hang out, etc.  
Well, Lance ended up confessing his feelings for me that weekend, and I decided: hey, why not? (I know.)  
So I spent the weekend with him. I noticed straight off the bat that he was VERY touchy. Not in a creepy way, just little things like touching my hair, putting a hand on my back, wrapping his arms around me, kisses, etc. I didn't particularly mind at first, but I was just the slightest bit put off by it. Fastforward to the next morning, where he and I are lying down, and he thinks I'm still asleep (I had not yet opened my eyes) and he tells me that he ""wants to spend the rest of his life with me""..... verbatim. I didn't know what to say, and I felt somewhat uncomfortable, so I pretended I was still asleep, because how is one even meant to respond to THAT? Mind you, we'd only started 'talking' THAT weekend. Later that night, I mentioned wanting to shower, and he said, verbatim: ""Let me carry my princess"" in a baby-talk voice??? Cringe as fuck, if I'm being honest. Maybe that's just me, though.

Fastforward again to the next day when I'm about to leave, he walks me to the door and stops me before I leave and says ""You know, if you're comfortable with it, I'd love for you to move in."" I promptly left. He then left two days later to go to London (to attend a friend's wedding, which he invited me as his plus one to attend, to which I declined because for one, we're NOT at 'wedding attending' stage, or anywhere close to it. Secondly, he had told me last minute and I couldn't get the time off of work.)

He ended up sending me a drunk text about how he ""hasn't smiled this much in forever, and how badly he wishes I was there, and how he NEEDS to have me in his life"". I've obviously told my best friend (22F) about this, and she said it's giving 'grooming'. But in my opinion, it's also giving 'love bombing' because in the weekend we were together at his place, he:

1. Woke me up to massages
2. Cooked me breakfast
3. Bought me coffee and bought my Ubers

And just a bunch of stuff like that in general. There's so much I could throw into this, but this has already gotten long-winded. My instincts are definitely screaming ""Girl RUN"" but I honestly need to know if this is just me, or if this whole thing is just super weird??

EDIT: I don't know why everyone's assuming I slept with him? I never stated, or implied, that I did. It's important to note that I have NOT. It's honestly weird to assume that, but okay. ",4,1744908975.0,makemychoice,60,0.7,False

I could really use some outside perspective ‚Äî especially from anyone in long-term relationships or who values relationship challenges as opportunity for growth as a couple. I‚Äôm 33F, and I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend (32M) for a year and a half. I recently moved in with him (2 months ago), as we share the intention of gearing towards marriage. I‚Äôm aware perfection doesn't exist, but I do wish to be in a loving, secure partnership built on mutual effort and respect.

What‚Äôs Great:

* We‚Äôre similar in age, background, and values.
* Our families get along well and we share the same cultural roots.
* We have great conversations, laugh a lot, and genuinely enjoy each other‚Äôs company at home.
* We support each other‚Äôs ambitions ‚Äî he‚Äôs been supportive during my recent job loss.
* We both want kids, and would be great parents.
* In general, we are compatible in most lifestyle choices.

What‚Äôs Getting Harder to Ignore:

* He has a high level work position, and is married to his job, thinking about it 24/7.
* He‚Äôs stingy ‚Äî gifts or meals come with a reminder of their cost. (I empathise that he has loans, but I find it impolite to make your partner feel a burden over a gift or special occasion dinner. I gift him high cost items and don't mention the price).
* He expects us to be financially 50/50, even though he earns significantly more (though to his credit, he‚Äôs been flexible during my unemployment).
* His friends rank extremely high on his priority list. When I express feeling secondary, he insists I‚Äôm wrong. But actions say otherwise: when he/we go out with them, he's willing to stay out late (with the help of something), and when it comes to our dates, he would rather stay home. And when we do go out on a date, we are leaving for home by 10pm upon completing dinner. He also avoids joining me when I have something my friends, even though I always show up for his. Saying he prefers his people on his time off. (My friends are cool).
* When I ask for affection (cuddles, quality time), he says 'I'm never happy' or says it‚Äôs ‚Äúnever enough.‚Äù He once deflected saying I don't initiate.. So I started to do so, and then he complained it was too often. I later found he watched P and left me hanging for over a week. 
* When I express hurt, he sometimes gaslights me or DARVOs it.
* We don‚Äôt share any hobbies that bring us closer, as his hobbies are all with his buddies: video games and sports. I tried showing interest in learning video games, but he said it was his 'me time'.
* My boyfriend's dad is not the role model of a gentleman, kind and loving husband to his wife (boyfriend's mum), who is a super sweet kind woman. Her sadness is prevalent, to the point it affects her health. It scares me that their relationship could become my/our future if my partner follows in his father's footsteps in his attitude with me. 

The Breaking Point:  
A few days ago, I had a live YouTube podcast interview ‚Äî a milestone in my career. The apartment we're living in is new and still has no doors (they‚Äôre being installed soon), I told him of it 2 weeks prior for him to be aware.

That day, he messaged about wanting to invite his friends over to play cards. Granted he asked if he could bring them, I said OK & reminded him of the podcast and he promised they‚Äôd be quiet.

They weren‚Äôt.

From the start of the interview, I was being told live by the interviewers that I had feedback of background noise. I had to mute myself several times and missed some speaking cues. I texted him during the podcast to lower the volume ‚Äî he read it and ignored it. Mid-speaking at one point I had to excuse the noise, mute and call out from one room to another 'silence please'‚Ä¶ Thankfully that helped - but I shouldn't have needed to do so.

Afterwards, he said he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúembarrass himself‚Äù by asking his friends to be quiet ‚Äî and was offended that I yelled. I was stunned. I felt unsupported, humiliated publicly at what he caused me, and disappointed that he didn‚Äôt advocate for me. I realised that he doesn't have my best interests at heart, cos if he did, he would have done better.

Two days later, we finally talked. He admitted he messed up. I appreciated that he acknowledged to have messed up, and I cooked us dinner. But instead of reconnecting after dinner, he chose to play video games online with his friends. Again.

We are now back to square one, in which he is upset that I got upset that he went to play video games instead of reconnecting together and healing from that hiccup. 

I am worried. That this would be my fate with him. That he does what he wants, when he wants, how he wants. And that I'm to be at the mercy of his priorities and/ or gratifications. I feel I'm in his life to fill the role of a girlfriend and potential future wife, who will get him kids, to give him a stable domestic life. Other than that, his life is his to do as he pleases, irrespective of me and my own needs as a human being and person.

I know no relationship is perfect. I‚Äôve made mistakes too and my errors were wakeup calls to improve as a partner. But the podcast incident showed me ‚Äî painfully ‚Äî how low I fall on his list of priorities when the moment really matters.

I want real love. Effort. Growth. Empathy. Understanding. But right now, I feel like I‚Äôm settling for crumbs and calling it a meal.

How do I know if he can wake up and smell the coffee, to be a better man for me?   
If ever, this is a wake up and smell the coffee moment for me, to realise I'm falling short of my potential in how he is treating me. I know I deserve a loving man, who would show how lucky he feels to have me in his life.   
At the same time, how can we as a couple both do better to be better for each other? 

TL;DR:  
After 1.5 years together (2 months living in), I‚Äôm feeling like a low priority to my boyfriend. He‚Äôs work-focused, emotionally distant, and puts his friends above me. A recent podcast interview ‚Äî important for my career ‚Äî was ruined because he ignored my request for quiet and let his friends be loud. I‚Äôm now questioning if I‚Äôm asking too much or settling for someone who isn‚Äôt capable of the love I need.",1,1744908618.0,relationship_advice,11,0.67,False

1k1hk7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1k1hk7a/70s_w_healthy_lifestyle_still_has_high_bp_what/,"70s w healthy lifestyle still has high bp, what else to try?","Hi Reddit,
My parents are both 75 with high BP. They've been on medication for a couple of years. My mom just got notified by her doctor that her kidney function is not where it should be - her eGFR was 52 and she's scheduled for a kidney ultrasound. She eats a mostly vegan diet and exercises 6 days per week, very healthy and active, petite and 130lbs, and this has been the case for over a decade before her high BP diagnosis. When her high bp was first caught, it was VERY high (i don't remember the numbers). 

She drinks coffee daily, since she's been on the meds she hasn't been watching salt too carefully but I don't think she eats an excessive amount, and she has some issues with sleep and stress. But generally, for a 75 year old woman, she couldn't have a healthier lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise, and she's mentally very sharp, capable, active. 

I have a feeling her kidney numbers have been declining with time and the doctor only just now said something since it dropped below 60, but i'll be looking at her labs soon. I have a suspicion right now that it's the BP medication, because I've read that's known to happen.
She's on 100mg losartin and 5mg amlodipine. 

We're planning to get her to a nephrologist. She hasn't been seeing a cardiologist - she's seeing a GP instead - since her high BP diagnosis. 

I'm thinking that maybe if we can get her BP down, she'll be able to reduce the dose and possibly help with her kidney recovery or prevent further decline. 

What should we look for in a cardiologist? I want someone who takes prevention seriously. Has anyone tried acupuncture? It's helped me with TMJ and stress recently and I'm seeing that it's considered safe and effective for hypertension (and kidney disease, it looks like). 
She takes a bunch of supplements too, but we're concerned about those now due to the kidney numbers. 

I can try to find her a therapist too, though I'm worried stirring the emotional/psychological pot will make things worse before they get better. She's incredibly tough and I know she misses me immensely but she holds it in so I can live my life without guilt. I think she's generally pretty lonely. I'm considering moving to be with her - I live clear across the US.

Any and all things you've had success with beyond diet and exercise - what were they? Should we be paying attention to the possibility of a different underlying issue? What tests should we advocate for? (ie tests for other underlying causes? i just read about Primary Aldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome).)

First we must consider what we know of it.

*""The flavorful nut of a¬†Pincha Pepperplant. The bitter outer rind hides a rich, peppery core that is useful in cooking.""*

*Pepper Bread - A loaf of bread, lightly spiced with*¬†[*Pincha Peppernut*](https://oxygennotincluded.wiki.gg/wiki/Pincha_Peppernut)¬†*for a mild bite.*  
*There's a simple joy to be had in pulling it apart in one's fingers.*

*Stuffed Berry - A baked Bristle Berry stuffed with delectable spices and vibrantly flavored.*

*Spicy Tofu - Tofu marinated in a flavorful Pincha Pepperplant sauce.*

*Espresso -  A shot of espresso helps Duplicants relax after a long day. Athletics: +1*

*Immuno Booster - Significantly reduces the chance of becoming sick.*

From ONI we can confirm:

* Peppernuts contain Caffeine or another stimulant (e.g. amphetamine).
* Peppernuts contain a spicy/heat tasting chemical, possibly Pepperine (black pepper), Capsacian (chilies), or Hydroxy-Œ±-sanshool (Szechuan Peppercorn)
* Peppernuts have medicinal properties, which means it either is modified with medicinal DNA, or based on something with a medicinal property (unlikely)

**I propose the Pincha Peppernut tastes like the perfect coffee bean, tasting strongly of sweet caramels, pecans, and a complex blend of citrus and stone fruits, enhanced by the tingling and sensitivity of Hydroxy-Œ±-sanshool from Szechuan pepper, while carrying a future stimulant similar to a mild amphetamine.**",14,1744908479.0,Oxygennotincluded,5,1.0,False
1k1his5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1k1his5/sad_days_of_the_modern_sheaffer/,Sad days of the modern Sheaffer,"I'm fairly recent in collecting vintage pens, and one maker that I've come to really love is Sheaffer.

Before I ever ventured into buying vintage, I bought a Sheaffer 100 off of a recommendation. And to say the least, I feel I overpaid for a very pedestrian pen.  Yeah, it's a metal body and cap, and sure it looks a bit handsome, but the nib is nothing at all to write home about. Just nothing special at all about it.

Flash forward a few months and I was in a local stationery store that sell a very small collection of restored fountain pens (for slightly above market price, but I didn't know at the time) and they had a Sheaffer Targa.  They allowed me to dip test it and WHOA, that nib was special. Liquid smooth. I bought it and have been very happy with it.

To date, I now own 5 vintage Sheaffer fountain pens and they are all special in their own ways.  The more I read and investigate and purchase, the more I realize that in it's day, Sheaffer was a very innovative US brand.  I mean, just the Snorkel filler alone was amazing.  YES, I know, they are overly complex, very hard to work on and due to that many people don't like them.  But this was a company shooting for the moon to develop a filling system like that.  I think they are amazing.

The nibs, that conical Triumph nib. That inlaid Targa nib.  Both of them are \*chefs kiss\*.  I now have two Targa's, which were made from the 70s I think to the late 90s... amazingly good nibs. Such a joy to write with.  I also have two with a Triumph nib.  They are very rigid nails, but they are smooth as glass nails.  I love them.  I feel both nib types are pretty unique in their own way.

Between filling systems, and nibs, and design, for decades it really seems like Sheaffer was one of the most innovative brands on the market.  Flash forward to today.  What do they have to offer?  Nothing special.  Nothing about their modern brand makes them stick out in the market.  And that's sad, especially when you see the relaunch of another old brand like Esterbrook that seems to be killing it.  While Esterbrook isn't necessary reinventing and innovating in any meaning way, they are still staying on top of current trends, working with some artists to do special editions of their pens, to really keep their name relevant and the demand for their product relatively high (looking at the CoffeeMonsterzCO collab as an example).  I recently got my first Estie and I really like it. Very smooth nib, springy cap, great size, it's a pleasure to write with, much more so than the modern Sheaffer 100 I own, it's not even close (granted, the Estie is WAY more expensive so I know I'm not comparing apples to apples there).

It's just sad that the modern Sheaffer, or rather the firm that owns them, William Penn I believe, just doesn't seem interested in investing the money to innovate and make them a marquee name again.  Maybe I'm missing something and if I am, please do tell me.  Is there a modern model that is really making waves out there?  I don't think a special edition coffee colored model 100 is really going to turn too many heads.  Their nibs on the modern Sheaffer are just meh.  I would love to see them take a chance and do some retro models.  Bring back a new Targa.  I'd love to see them do a modern PFM for example (a vintage PFM is HIGH on my list of vintage pens to buy).  But I know that costs money and the demand for it has to be there to make it profitable.  Sheaffer seem to live and die on their ballpoints these days, I doubt their fountain pens make too much of a dent in their overall gross revenue.

Please let me know if I'm wrong in my assessment of the modern Sheaffer brand and point me towards a model that is as good as their old offerings.  I'm curious to know what everybody's thoughts are.

1k1hhap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1k1hhap/accused_of_planting_dirty_underwear_in_the_office/,Accused of planting dirty underwear in the office coffee bar. Proven innocent. Still trying to make sense of it.,"I‚Äôm still trying to process what can only be described as the most unhinged fever dream¬†of my professional life ‚Äî and honestly, it still doesn‚Äôt feel real.

Tuesday morning, I got into the office around 7:30 AM, like I usually do. As I was walking in, I was behind a colleague who stopped at one of the tables by the stairs that I take up to my desk. I noticed a piece of fabric on the floor nearby and, assuming it may have been hers, I picked it up and asked her. She says no, so I‚Äôm just standing there holding this random piece of cloth, not really knowing what to do with it.¬†

I didn‚Äôt feel like walking back to the front desk, and I didn‚Äôt want to just carry some random thing around, so I put it down on the nearest flat surface: the edge of a coffee bar, next to the register (not on food, not on any equipment, just off to the side) where someone could spot it if they came looking. Then I went about my day. A complete non-event. Or so I thought.¬†

A few hours later, HR asked me to meet them in a conference room. I wasn't alarmed at first, and the conversation started casual, but quickly shifted to being extremely tense. I am told that I am caught on security footage placing -- *plot twist!* \--¬†dirty underwear¬†on the coffee bar.¬†

Thinking this is a silly misunderstanding, my first reaction was just grossed out that I'd unknowingly picked up underwear and didn't even wash my hands after. But then I realized: they were *serious.* And not only that, they ACTUALLY believed I‚Äôd done this gross action intentionally, and, further, the implication is now there that I could be fired over this. 

I¬†explained that I'd picked it up off the floor to ask my colleague if it was hers, and set it down nearby when she said no. That‚Äôs when the whole meeting took a sharp left turn: they told me there was ""no other person"" around me in the camera footage and strongly implied I was lying. They refused to show me the footage, or even tell me the angle of the camera, just kept exchanged glances with each other. 

I am still confused (since there are many cameras) how they did not check ANY other footage that would definitely show both me picking up the fabric and/or my interaction with a colleague. I suggested checking the entry logs (my colleague had swiped in minutes before me) or any other camera angles, and they brushed it off ‚Äî clearly not interested in clearing things up. The whole thing had a bizarre energy that they were convinced of my guilt before I even finished talking.¬†

They told me they were giving me the ‚Äúopportunity to tell my side‚Äù purely because of the relationship I‚Äôve built with them over the years ‚Äî which, honestly, felt more like a warning than a courtesy. Also, since I now I'm feeling like I'm about to be fired, I'm also trying to understand if this even is a fire-able¬†offence because WTF.

Then they sent me home while they ‚Äúwrapped up the investigation.‚Äù They even gathered my things for me, which was as awkward as it sounds, complete with them exchanging more glances and whispered ""do YOU want to..."" exchanges. Again, I want to be very clear that I did not identify the item as underwear (dirty or not).¬†I picked it up thinking I was being helpful. The whole thing spiraled into full absurdity.

Fast forward to late afternoon ‚Äî after what felt like an agonizingly long stretch of fielding ‚Äúwtf is going on?‚Äù texts from coworkers, taking a very dissociating drive home, and mentally spiraling about what I‚Äôd do if I actually got fired over this ‚Äî and an entire dazed thought pattern on how did they even *know* the underwear was dirty? Was it dirty because it had been worn? Or dirty because it had fallen on the office floor and been stepped on? Does it even matter? 

Anyway, HR finally calls. They‚Äôd located the colleague I mentioned (aka, the one they told me didn‚Äôt exist) and, shocker, she ""corroborated"" my story so... case closed! No apology. No acknowledgment of the fact that I‚Äôd been accused of a workplace hygiene crime and treated like I‚Äôd staged some kind of undergarment rebellion (or, you know, just ANY acknowledgement of how humiliating and dehumanizing the whole experience was). Just: ""it‚Äôs resolved.""¬†¬†

I‚Äôm still reeling over the fact that they **wanted** to believe the worst. It was clear they only reviewed one angle of the footage ‚Äî and even if someone had done this on purpose, why would anyone choose a cash register, the one spot guaranteed to be under constant surveillance? I still believe there‚Äôs footage of my entire walk to and up the stairs that they either ignored or chose not to review before accusing me.

For extra fun: I found out later they‚Äôd informed my director about the ‚Äúresolution‚Äù two hours before they bothered to call me. So I spent the whole afternoon spiraling, fully convinced I was about to be fired ‚Äî only to finally get the world‚Äôs most anticlimactic ‚Äúall set‚Äù call. (Which, for the record, I recorded. One: I thought I might be getting fired. Two: I was so stressed I figured I‚Äôd black out and forget the conversation.)

They had two full hours to prepare for this call ‚Äî and still managed to be completely devoid of empathy, and painfully awkward.

To add more flavor to the corporate fever dream: the week before this happened, the company globally rolled out a new hardline 5-days-in-office policy (after years of hybrid -- even pre-Covid the policy was hybrid with 2x a week in office). And the *day before* the incident, I was told my entire department was being eliminated and my end date would be August ‚Äî which makes sense from a knowledge-transfer standpoint. But the timing? Suspicious, to say the least. 

Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering:

* Why were they so comfortable jumping to the worst possible conclusion? 
* And why, even after my story was confirmed, was there zero acknowledgment of how messed up the situation was?
* How do I bounce back emotionally from this? Do I escalate or laugh it off? 
* Was this a genuine HR fail or are they trying to push me out? 
   * (My director says they honestly do want me to stay until August for knowledge transfer purposes. And honestly... it's an at-will state, they could just fire me!)¬†

I keep swinging between feeling like I‚Äôm in some corporate reality TV prank and like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I called out sick yesterday because I honestly couldn‚Äôt compute the emotional whiplash of it all. I‚Äôm still stuck somewhere between laughing at the absurdity and feeling gross about how quickly they were willing to believe the worst.

The only thing I know for sure? The simulation glitched. This is peak Corporate America.



**TL;DR:**  
Picked up a mystery piece of fabric from the office floor, placed it on a visible counter if someone came looking for it. HR later accused me of leaving dirty underwear on the coffee counter and lying about it. Sent me home. Once a colleague confirmed my story, the matter was ‚Äúresolved‚Äù ‚Äî no apology, no acknowledgment, just corporate gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss.",104,1744908320.0,antiwork,42,0.94,False

1k1hdyo,https://i.redd.it/q4dzhozjbfve1.jpeg,7 Surprising Signs You‚Äôre Dehydrated ‚Äî and How to Fix It Fast,"**Dehydration isn't always about thirst. Your body gives subtle (and not-so-subtle) clues. Learn to spot them early and rehydrate the right way.**

We‚Äôve all heard ‚ÄúDrink more water,‚Äù but many people still walk around mildly dehydrated without even knowing it. Dehydration isn‚Äôt just about feeling thirsty ‚Äî in fact, by the time you‚Äôre *thirsty*, your body is already running low.

If you‚Äôre experiencing strange symptoms, your body might be crying out for hydration. Here are **7 surprising signs of dehydration** ‚Äî plus how to fix it quickly and effectively.

# üíß 1. Fatigue and Low Energy

Dehydration can slow down circulation and oxygen flow to the brain, making you feel sluggish, sleepy, or unmotivated ‚Äî even if you slept well.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning. Add lemon or a pinch of sea salt for extra electrolytes.

# üíß 2. Dry Skin or Breakouts

If your skin feels tight, flaky, or you‚Äôre breaking out more than usual, dehydration could be to blame. Your skin needs water to stay plump and detox properly.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Sip water throughout the day and add water-rich foods like cucumber, berries, and oranges to your meals.

# üíß 3. Bad Breath

Saliva helps wash away bacteria. When you‚Äôre dehydrated, saliva production slows down ‚Äî leading to dry mouth and unpleasant odor.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Hydrate with water or herbal teas, and avoid alcohol or too much caffeine, which can dry you out more.

# üíß 4. Cravings for Sugar or Salt

Your body might misinterpret dehydration as hunger, especially cravings for sugar or salty snacks. It‚Äôs your body asking for quick energy or minerals.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Next time a craving hits, try drinking water first ‚Äî you might find it disappears in minutes.

# üíß 5. Dizziness or Lightheadedness

Low fluid levels reduce blood volume, which can cause a drop in blood pressure, making you feel dizzy ‚Äî especially when standing up too fast.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Drink coconut water or a homemade electrolyte drink (water + salt + honey + lemon).

# üíß 6. Dark Urine or Infrequent Peeing

Clear or light yellow urine is a sign of proper hydration. If yours is dark or you‚Äôre going hours without urinating, it‚Äôs time to drink up.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

# üíß 7. Mood Swings or Brain Fog

Even mild dehydration affects your brain. You might feel irritable, anxious, or have trouble focusing. Hydration boosts mental clarity and stabilizes mood.

# ‚úÖ Quick Fix:

Keep a refillable water bottle nearby and drink mindfully ‚Äî especially during stressful tasks.

# üß† Bonus Tip: Not All Fluids Hydrate You

Coffee, energy drinks, and sodas may quench thirst temporarily, but they can be **diuretics**, meaning they dehydrate you more. Stick to:

* Water
* Herbal teas
* Coconut water
* Fruit-infused water

# ü•§ How Much Water Should You Drink?

A good rule of thumb:  
**Half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water per day.**  
Example: If you weigh 150 lbs ‚Üí aim for \~75 oz of water daily.

Listen to your body ‚Äî and your pee ‚Äî for signs you‚Äôre on track!

# üåü Final Thoughts

Your body is about 60% water ‚Äî so it makes sense that hydration affects nearly every function. Don‚Äôt wait for thirst to hit. Start making hydration a habit, and you‚Äôll likely feel the difference in your energy, skin, mood, and focus.",1,1744908095.0,u_Doctor_Dhanu,0,1.0,False

The site manager has a week off so she is basically the ‚Äúmain‚Äù manager on paper and opens the shop with me, as I always work in the morning with the site manager and the deli supervisor. A few issues I‚Äôve observed this past week while working with the new assistant manager. I understand she‚Äôs still new, but these things have impacted our opening tasks and day-to-day flow quite a bit:

	1.	She consistently closes the shop doors while we‚Äôre still setting up before opening the shop, which makes it difficult for me to complete time-sensitive opening tasks like placing fire extinguishers outside and bringing in the day‚Äôs newspapers efficiently.

	2.	The coffee machine isn‚Äôt started on time, delaying our ability to open and serve waiting customers promptly.

	3.	She frequently asks about or forgets things we‚Äôve already explained to her more than once.

	4.	She tends to stay at the till during morning shifts instead of focusing on managerial duties, particularly updating paperwork or assisting with setups.

	5.	She often loses her temper when she struggles to explain herself clearly, which creates tension and confusion. She‚Äôs also sarcastic and has a bitter face half of the time especially because she doesn‚Äôt take her break on time.

	6.	When one of the tills wasn‚Äôt working properly, she asked me to call the support office on her behalf, saying she didn‚Äôt understand the till‚Äîbut the fix only required logging out using her own code.

	7.	I‚Äôve found myself constantly problem-solving and putting out fires for her, which affects my own responsibilities.

	8.	When I suggested putting out Easter products for the weekend, she refused, saying she hadn‚Äôt been told directly by the site manager‚Äîeven though he is on leave, and it was clearly something that needed action.

	9.	She didn‚Äôt pack the milk delivery while I was on break, which caused delays until the evening shift member arrived. I had to apologise and ask him to do it, as I was already overloaded with other tasks thanks to her being unaware about things.

	10.	We clocked in late because she kept the door closed, insisting the shop opens later‚Äîbut we couldn‚Äôt access the back door since only senior team members have keys, which led to a delay. She also keeps the shop lights closed before opening the shop and it‚Äôs difficult to do our opening tasks in the dark.

       11. She doesn‚Äôt order necessary products of the shop or over orders some products. She doesn‚Äôt spell properly. She‚Äôs always doing tasks which doesn‚Äôt require her supervision.

       12. Especially while opening, she‚Äôs doing my tasks instead of doing her own managerial duties. She also hovers over my till especially in the middle of me doing a sale.

        13. She hasn‚Äôt been able to solve most of the issues we have faced so far during the week even with the assistance of other senior managers from other sites.

        14. She‚Äôs always reiterating the tasks I already know I need to do.

        15. Half of the time, I‚Äôm handling everything including the deli as she‚Äôs MIA at times or doesn‚Äôt know stuff.

         16. She called me to help her with two things, which are some of the most basic things a sales professional knows how to do, during both of my breaks of the shift.

Previous to meeting a guy, I asked to talk on the phone. After talking to him, I didn‚Äôt feel the click. I didn‚Äôt like what he said on the phone. He was different from the chat. He came across egoistic and he made me feel inferior though he didn‚Äôt know many things about where we live (he‚Äôs a foreigner here). I gave him a leeway and he took miles. My friends told me short men tend to have egos to make up for the height etc and they asked me to ask him how long he‚Äôs been single because I shouldn‚Äôt be talking to him if he‚Äôs that egoistic... I think he went above and beyond to try to be nice to me on the phone but his egoistic natures creeped here and there, I could tell. I was so disappointed I thought he was a nice man. I kind of regret talking to him on the phone. But I‚Äôm assuming he would be egoistic in person too right? 

I have other date requests, but today I felt so scared a guy demanded a coffee date instead of supper, so I said I‚Äôm easy going and he‚Äôs not. Like who cares if we don‚Äôt click we can split the bill and enjoy supper. I closed him saying we ain‚Äôt a match. I also don‚Äôt like guys who make so much fuss while I offered to meet during the week day after I suggested a coffee date on the weekend. He came back any other options he‚Äôs busy that day? He‚Äôs too particular, too fussy and not fun to talk to. Don‚Äôt like guys like this. I think he also had egos and sensed he was a bit of player. So that was that. I unmatched him. 

Would you talk to your match before going on a in person date? What has been your experience?

First and foremost, it's so bitter to the point that the only way for it to taste good in any capacity is that you have to overload it with a crap ton of sugar, cream, and etc. You may as well be eating a ripoff milkshake.

And for those who are gonna be like, ""I order it black----"" you're probably the type to be like, ""I drink it for the energy---""

No you don't. Not anymore at least.

Caffeine does give temporary energy but when you down coffee every single day, your brain grows a neuro-dependency to the effects caffeine gives you until you are numb to it. So even if the energy was the initial reason you began drinking it, it's CERTAINLY not the reason you still drink it now. It's just out of a habit.

""You probably haven't tried coffee from this place----""

Even if I wanted to, it'd literally be impossible for me to try every single type of coffee from every single establishment there is around my lifetime. I personally think that if I have to visit a *specific* spot JUST to get a better version of something the brand already provides, that sounds like a skill issue, bro.

I've ***tried*** to like coffee. I've tried it multiple times every which way from Sunday----I still hate it. Coffee just tastes nasty.

On top of that, it heightens my anxiety way too much. So if anything, I may as well be drinking a potion of anxiety inducement and that sounds very counterintuitive to my well being.

1k1h8m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k1h8m4/cmv_tipping_in_the_us_is_just_wage_outsourcing/,CMV: Tipping in the U.S. is just wage outsourcing and it needs to go.,"I‚Äôm originally from Germany, where tipping is a small thank-you‚Äînot a paycheck. Since moving to the U.S., I‚Äôve been shocked at how tipping here isn't a bonus for great service, but a requirement just to earn a living. I think this system is irrational, unfair to workers, and ultimately harmful to everyone involved‚Äîespecially the people it's meant to support.

Here are the core reasons I think the U.S. should abandon tipping as a wage system:

**1. The employer should pay wages‚Äînot the customer.**  
Why is it the customer‚Äôs responsibility to make sure someone earns a livable income? In other countries, like Germany, the employer pays staff a fair wage, and tipping is optional. In Italy, tipping can actually be considered rude. The idea that a worker‚Äôs income should depend on the generosity of strangers just seems wrong.

**2.¬†Workers make very low base wages and fully depend on tips to survive.**  
This creates huge income instability. In many states, the base wage for tipped workers is just $2.13/hour. Employers are required to ensure total wages (tips + base) reach the minimum wage, but this calculation often happens monthly. So if a worker has a bad week with few tips, they take home very little, even if the next week makes up for it statistically. This kind of volatility is especially damaging for workers with families or fixed expenses.

**3. It‚Äôs not actually an incentive for good service.**  
Despite what people claim, most Americans tip 15‚Äì20% by default. It‚Äôs become a social expectation, not a reward for excellent service. That means workers don‚Äôt get tipped more for great service‚Äîor less for poor service‚Äîat any consistent rate. The ‚Äúperformance-based‚Äù argument just doesn‚Äôt hold up in reality. How many times did you tip 20% even though your water wasn't even refilled?

**4. Tipping is spreading into absurd places.**  
We‚Äôre now being asked to tip at coffee shops, bakeries, self-checkout stations, airport food courts‚Äîeverywhere. This takes away from the idea of tipping as a reward for¬†*exceptional*¬†service and turns it into an all-purpose wage supplement. It's diluting the meaning of tipping while letting employers off the hook.

**5. Employers aren't actually guaranteeing fair wages in practice.**  
Because the wage+tip calculation is retroactive, the system doesn‚Äôt protect workers in real-time. You could work an entire week and not know whether you‚Äôll actually make enough‚Äîuntil much later. And if a strong week bumps your monthly average above minimum wage, your employer owes you nothing for the lean weeks.

**6. Tipping rewards seniority and shift luck‚Äînot quality of service.**  
Servers with more experience often get the busier, higher-paying shifts. This creates an unfair advantage, even if the actual service level is the same. It‚Äôs not a performance-based reward system; it‚Äôs a hierarchy where new workers get the leftovers, no matter how hard they try.  


I know some workers prefer tipping because they¬†*can*¬†make more on a good night. I also understand that eliminating tipping could be disruptive in the short term. Still, the current model is unstable, unfair, and built on a shaky foundation of social guilt and economic outsourcing.

Here‚Äôs what I learned about the feasibility and practicality of using **Gcash Tap n Pay** in the Philippines.

# Main Experience

Using **Tap n Pay** was overall a **fun and convenient** experience. It felt **safe** because of the tokenized transactions that come with NFC payments. Compared to **QR payments**, Tap n Pay was more reliable‚ÄîQR scanning often felt outdated, and I encountered issues with scannability due to reflections or worn-down printouts at some establishments.

There were times when I was told that the store‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt accept this form of payment yet. While this could be true, I also suspect that many cashiers aren't fully trained or informed about how this payment method works, especially since it‚Äôs still relatively new in the market.

However, Tap n Pay worked well at many major stores like **Savemore**, **SM Stores**, **Watsons**, fast food chains, and coffee shops. The key to success was ensuring the store had a compatible terminal‚Äîlook for terminals from **Maya**, **BDO**, **Paymate**, or any POS terminal that supports contactless payments. It's always best to ask first if you're unsure.

There were a few hiccups, though, with the feature being unavailable or not detected by the app. But I found a quick fix, which I‚Äôll share later.

# Establishments Where Tap n Pay Worked

Here‚Äôs a list of places where I successfully used Tap n Pay (though not all locations are guaranteed to accept it):

* **Savemore Market**
* **SM Supermarket**
* **Lawsons**
* **Jollibee**
* **McDonald's**
* **Chowking**
* **Starbucks**
* **Zus Coffee**
* **Mr. DIY**

The most surprising was **7-Eleven**, as I thought they‚Äôd be more updated, but many branches still didn‚Äôt accept Tap n Pay.

# Pros and Cons of Tap n Pay

# Pros:

* **Convenient and Safer**: The process is faster and more secure than QR scanning, and you don't need to worry about carrying cash or physical cards.
* **Lightens Your Wallet**: Using Tap n Pay means you don‚Äôt need to carry physical cards, reducing the risk if your wallet gets lost or stolen.
* **Ease of Use**: With NFC payments, you just tap your phone‚Äîno need to fiddle with QR codes or deal with issues like angles or damage.

# Cons:

* **Limited Acceptance**: Not all businesses have the terminals that support Tap n Pay. Some stores still rely on QR payments or cash.
* **App and Internet Dependence**: The app must be open, and you need an internet connection for it to work, unlike Google Pay, which can function offline (though with some limitations based on your bank‚Äôs policy).
* **Occasional Reconfiguration**: Sometimes, the app needs to be reconfigured or reset to make it work again.
* **Public Transport Issues**: Currently, Tap n Pay isn‚Äôt available for use on public transport, meaning I had to rely on cash for those trips. (hello, MRT, jeepneys... anyone?)
* **Educating Cashiers**: Some merchants might not be familiar with the payment system, requiring you to assure them or even walk them through the process.
* **Minimum Spend Requirement**: Some stores set a minimum spend (ranging from ‚Ç±100-‚Ç±500) when using cards.

# Quick Fix for Tap n Pay Not Working Issues

If Tap n Pay stops working or isn‚Äôt detected, I found that clearing your app‚Äôs data and reconfiguring it usually does the trick. If that doesn‚Äôt work, your phone‚Äôs **NFC chip** might be damaged or not supported, or there could be a system outage with GCash. You can also check if the feature is down for maintenance or consult GCash‚Äôs help articles for troubleshooting. you can also look at this list of phones that have and don't have NFC [here](https://www.nfcw.com/nfc-phones-list/).

If the fix above doesn't work then check if G-cash or the feature is unavailable or in maintenance.

# Compatibility

GCash Tap n Pay is only compatible with **some Android devices** that have an NFC chip. My phone, the **Sony Xperia 1 II**, works fine, but my friend's **POCO X4 Pro** couldn‚Äôt enable Tap n Pay. Unfortunately, **Apple** and **Huawei** devices aren‚Äôt supported, and you can‚Äôt use wearables like watches to make payments with GCash Tap n Pay just yet.

# 

# Final Thoughts

Despite a few hurdles, **Tap n Pay** offers a convenient, secure, and tech-forward way to pay for workers and students like me where convenience and time is valuable. It‚Äôs already working well at many major establishments, but there‚Äôs still room for improvement, especially with merchant education and more widespread terminal adoption. it‚Äôs definitely worth exploring, but make sure to keep some cash on hand for places that aren‚Äôt quite there yet.",2,1744907631.0,DigitalbanksPh,1,1.0,False

- I like deep convos, absurd humor, psychology, long walks (mentally or literally), and trying to understand this strange experience called being human.

- Basically, I'm just a curious mind wrapped in a cozy hoodie with access to decent WiFi.

What I‚Äôm looking for:  
I don‚Äôt have a long checklist, but I vibe best with women who are emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and open to sharing their perspectives (even if they differ from mine ‚Äî I love hearing new angles on things). Some shared interests are cool but not required ‚Äî just be someone who‚Äôs thoughtful, understanding, and can handle some playful sarcasm and occasional philosophical spirals.

Long distance? Totally cool with me. Let‚Äôs just start by talking and see where it goes. No pressure to jump into anything ‚Äî I‚Äôm more interested in the¬†*c*onnection than a rushed label.

Bonus points if you:

- Like voice notes more than paragraphs  
- Have a favorite comfort show or rewatch the same movie like it‚Äôs therapy.  
- Can roast me just enough to keep me humble

If any of this sounds like your jam, slide into my DMs with your favorite movie, quote, or a random deep thought you‚Äôve had lately. Worst case? We exchange a few good memes. Best case? We‚Äôre planning a cute video date with snacks and an overly analyzed movie night.

A short story. A few years back I met an old man in Githunguri that told me a heart breaking story. During the colonial period, the locals used to work at a mzungus coffee farm. The mzungu was known to be ruthless. He had instituted a system where every morning men that reported to work would be caned before they start working. 

Woe unto you if somehow you escaped the mandatory caning and he discovered that you had not received your daily dose. You would be beaten half to death.

Think about it. These men were fathers and husbands that were humiliated on a daily basis, in their own country, in order to provide. 

Do you think for a moment they used to admire the system and be grateful for the opportunity to be colonized?

So, for third hand colonial apologists, do you imagine that if colonization had continued, somehow you would have been special and escaped the brutality of the system on the indigenous populace?

There is a lot wrong with our country, but wishing for the colonizers to return somehow and redeem us, in my opinion, is stupidity of the highest order.

I always knew he had oral herpes (cold sores) but never contracted it and his outbreaks are SOO rare. Like only twice during the entire time I‚Äôve known him. Unbeknownst to me, asymptomatic shedding is a thing and we engaged in oral sex so I contracted them, down there. I was so unbelievably devastated. Bc when I contracted them, I had plans to move across the country to start a new job in a new city and start doing long distance with him (he was nothing but supportive) however, at the time, I was starting to become okay with the idea that we might not last through the move. I still followed through w the move, and we have been long distance for 1.5 years. I have never told him he gave them to me. 1. The stigma 2. He is the most anxious person I‚Äôve ever met. He would definitely spiral and think I cheated on him, even after I educate him on the fact he gave them to me through oral sex. He was a student athlete popular kid throughout school (aka, didn‚Äôt pay attention in sex ed ‚Ä¶)
He is a great guy. Calls me beautiful, brings me breakfast in bed, gets me coffee before I wake up, opens my car door, makes me laugh more than anyone. He makes me very happy. HOWEVER!!! His fatal flaw: he is CONSTSNTLY JOKING AROUND.  Farting on the phone, fart jokes, pee pee poo poo jokes, butt and pen*s jokes, speaking in funny voices, making funny faces. It drives me insane. He also grew up with only a brother and constantly thinks that girl things are weird. An example being I was shaving my legs in the bathtub bc I was going somewhere and didn‚Äôt want to get my hair wet, I was doing it in the bathtub. He thought that was SOOOOOO WEIRD. But then tells me I‚Äôm sensitive when I get defensive.

These little situations are driving me crazy. We are long distance so we don‚Äôt talk or see each other as much as regular couples. So I get frustrated that when we do talk and see each other, most of the time he is joking around acting like a little kid, or calling normal things I do, weird. But what makes me stay, is the fact I have herpes. I can‚Äôt imagine the conversation I would have to have with any new future partner and the potential rejection. And the potential that someone other than me knows I have this. I haven‚Äôt told ANYONE. Only my doctor knows and she made me feel so guilty and disgusting when she told me. Shrugging her shoulders and telling me I should have been more careful. But I got these from my long term boyfriend!!!!! Tf?! There is so much stigma around it that I fall victim to as well. So I stay with him.  Like I said he‚Äôs a great guy, has an amazing family, very sweet. I just think he needs to mature more, which he is!!! But these are all things I think about. I love him a lot, we talk about getting married and having kids. But how long does it take guys to mature? Everyone matures in someway. Idk I‚Äôm writing this and not planning to reread before I post bc I just want to share and get my mind off this bc it sends me into a spiral. ",37,1744907371.0,TwoHotTakes,69,0.77,False

These are obviously subjective judgments and not objective truths, but nevertheless, they do have value (because they manifest something about the subject who holds them).

For a leftcom, Stalin is not a real leftist, but he's clearly not right-wing either. Neither a classical liberal, nor a Nazi, nor an anarcho-capitalist would ever like Stalin, so he's clearly not right-wing in that sense. He is clearly not a centrist either, he was very extreme, radical and authoritarian in his ideology and policy, not a moderate. He is clearly not centre-left like the social democrats are, nor a centre-right conservative. And he was likely not an opportunist without ideology who just sought to insatiate a dictatorship by any means, since he wrote extensively about dialectical materialism and he was truly invested in the idea of creating ""a new man"". All of this leaves him to be far-left. Yet, leftcoms insist that he wasn't far left, in fact he wasn't left-wing at all, since he betrayed left-wing values such as equality or worker self-management. Workers didn't have it any better under Stalin than under capitalism, so it doesn't make sense to call him left-wing either. This leaves him to be the negation of leftism from within, a sort of ""leftism without leftism"". Zizek jokes about coffee without cream being different from coffee without milk but what if we had coffee without coffee? Or like Zizek says: beer without alcohol, coffee without caffeine, sugar without calories, etc. This is what Stalin represents for leftcoms and anarchists: clearly left-wing on the political spectrum, but without any hint of authentic leftist spirit (left-wing without equality).

Aren't deathcore, as well as more 'extreme' forms of Nu Metal (Slipknot, Cane Hill) in the exact same predicament in regards to categorization? A metal elitist who only listens to 'real metal' would insist that bands like Suicide Silence and Slipknot are not real metal. But if you ask them what genre they are then, they clearly cannot answer (just like Stalin is outside the political compass altogether for a leftcom). Suicide Silence is clearly not punk in the same way that Sum 41 is, nor is it classical hardcore punk like Black Flag is, nor is it simply ""rock"" because even Imagine Dragons is considered rock nowadays. Out of all the 'big genres' (rock, hip-hop, jazz, blues, EDM, metal, punk, classical, etc.) they're clearly closest to metal. Yet, there is something about the metal elitist that feels uneasy about placing them within the metal genre because there is something that makes such bands be ""poser music"". Deathcore becomes, then, a sort of ""metal without metal"", like Stalin is ""leftism without leftism"" for some.

What would Hegel say about this? Does this contradict Hegel's theory or is it consistent with his philosophy? In Lacanian terms, I can only think of these examples as confrontations with the real: what is repressed in a certain universal (leftism, metal music) is that which can't be symbolized in a symbolic system and returns to haunt it like a ghostly presence. This becomes like a negation that fails to sublate itself into a higher concept: not left-wing, but also not anything else - not metal, but also not any other genre.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! Let me be real with you: I used to be the queen/king of that elaborate time-blocking life. My morning routine was a whole event schedule. üåÖ Get up, meditate for 20 minutes, then it was 15 minutes of journaling, followed by 10 minutes of yoga, and by the time I even thought about breakfast, it was like I was already late for the day! Anyone else relate? 

But here‚Äôs the tea: trying to fit everything into little time slots became stressful and, honestly, kind of suffocating. That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon habit stacking. It‚Äôs like the magical answer to my overly complicated mornings! So, wanna know how I did it? Let me spill the beans!

**What‚Äôs Habit Stacking? ü§î**  
It‚Äôs pretty much combining smaller habits into a single routine so you can knock out more in less time. Think of it as the power-up combo in your favorite game! 

**Here‚Äôs how I made it work:**

1. **Identify Core Habits:**  
   - I picked 2-3 key things that I really wanted to accomplish every morning. For me, that was meditation, movement (like a quick stretch or dance party ‚Äî yes, I did that!), and a healthy breakfast.

2. **Combine & Conquer:**  
   - Instead of blocking out 20 minutes to meditate, while my coffee brewed, I‚Äôd meditate *while* my coffee dripped.
   - Got 5 minutes? Do a quick yoga flow! Do stretches while the kettle boils. Two birds, one stone, am I right?

3. **Set Intentional Transitions:**  
   - I linked habits together. For example, brushing my teeth was a cue to start my meditation. Seriously, a transitional habit becomes a launchpad for the next thing! 

4. **Cut the Fluff:**  
   - Sorry to all my 10-step skincare routines out there, but I embraced ""less is more."" I went for a quick cleanse and sunscreen instead of a spa day. Gotta prioritize the most effective stuff!

5. **Celebrate Small Wins:**  
   - Praise yourself when you successfully complete the stack! üéâ My personal win for the morning stack became a corner of my home where I kept a sticky note reward system. Feeling fab? Treat yourself to a double shot of your favorite coffee! 

**Why It‚Äôs a Game Changer:**  
- **Less Decision Fatigue:** No more overwhelmed brain, just habits that flow into one another!
- **More Time:** Seriously, I cut my morning routine in half and now I have *actual* time to enjoy my coffee or binge-watch a favorited morning show. 

So, there you have it! I went from a stressed mess to a streamlined morning routine that sets me up for success. Honestly, who knew combining habits could zap my morning into something I actually *look forward to*? 

I‚Äôd love to hear‚Äîwhat little habits have you combined to make your mornings smoother? Or what's your favorite tip for getting the most out of your day? Let‚Äôs swap strategies and keep this vibe going! üöÄ‚ú®",1,1744907115.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

It's like ep 2 to ep 7 was a fog, and we can finally get to the bomb they dropped on us in the first episode.

I miss Foggy Nelson. He was the missing part to the banter we got in this episode. Daredevil was always about Matt-Foggy-Karen not just Matt

The random scenes I enjoyed were:

* Frank Complaining about coffee
* ""Shotgun""
* Frank chowing down painkillers like it is candy
* The talk between Matt and Karen
* ""Its not dark, it's like a thousand suns""
* ""I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire""
* Fisk kills commissioner
* Anthony Petruccio 

The colors also got a huge upgrade. When looking at Matt lying in the hospital, I was surprised how much color was used. Usually there would be 2 to 3 colors in the background, the actors would be wearing mostly de-saturated clothes with small saturated accessories like tie, glasses, undershirt, or watch. That was certainly a look, but I loved the use of colors in this episode, where it is still dark but colors are more saturated.

I hope that when Matt says ""We need an army"", he means The Defenders. If not, then it would be criminal.

I REALLY hope that they don't make a love triangle out of Frank, Karen, Matt. Matt's love life is not really that interesting to me. Heather and Matt needed more time to get together.

I‚Äôm learning and settling in that American hustle culture 9-5 is not for me at all, I love to live slow and be the person God intended me to be in my feminine creativity. I actually got sad about it because I asked myself what is life more than work in America? I believe Japan has gone to a 4 day work week!!! 

I‚Äôve come to realize that I honestly prefer fully remote work, even though this position is hybrid. There will be times when I‚Äôm not in the office all the time, but I‚Äôm just realizing how much of an social recharger I am and naturally quiet and thrive when I am in my own space. In addition, how I like freedom of where I can work ( I don‚Äôt travel much but I love to sit in a coffee shop or a library to work) and not feel so ‚Äúboxed in‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy people, I do! But I‚Äôve come to understand that I don‚Äôt like to center my day around constant interactions in a grey unattractive yellow light setting especially when the work place lacks diversity and people I can relate to and look forward to converse with. I‚Äôm more focused on getting my work done and having that space to be productive.

Also, I don‚Äôt have an office. Not to say I need one, because I‚Äôm not in a manager or leadership position. Like, if I were to go into the office, I‚Äôd like to sit by the window so I can have natural lighting and see nature because I‚Äôm a nature girly or have my own office to close the door and lock in . But I‚Äôm completely closed off from nature in the office environment. On the other hand, when I‚Äôm working fully remote, I have the advantage of opening my windows, seeing the trees, hearing the birds sing, and even just having a slower, more peaceful morning. I really value the small things in life and remote work taught me that as well ( random walks for lunch break, attending lunch and learns, making quick returns and etc) . 

I don‚Äôt really want to complain about it, but I‚Äôm just learning as I go. I have to remind myself that this role isn‚Äôt my end-all, be-all. It doesn‚Äôt have to be. But I also have to remember that, when you‚Äôre in the office, some people like to have small talk or laugh really loud early in the morning, or when it‚Äôs your time to leave, people are still chit-chatting and laughing, and I‚Äôm already ready to go.

Again I am grateful just want to vent and seek you ladies voices! So how do y‚Äôall balance this out? Or have you ever been in a situation where you were fully remote, tried a hybrid schedule or fully in-office, and then started searching again for fully remote? If anyone has any experience with this, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing your thoughts!
