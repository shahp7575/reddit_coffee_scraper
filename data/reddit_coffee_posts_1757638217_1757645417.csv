1nery99,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1nery99/breastfeeding_and_caffeine/,Breastfeeding and caffeine,"Today I realized I accidentally consumed 410 mg of caffeine. I have been enjoying a frozen coffee from a chain the last few months. I managed to have two today, and only just now decided to look up the caffeine amount. 205 mg per medium!!!!

In retrospect, baby was VERY fussy today. Maybe even jittery movements. She’s going through the four month regression so I thought it was just par for the course until I connected the dots with my caffeine intake. Somehow though, I managed to put her to sleep after some crying and fussiness and she’s been down for the last 2 hours. 

I’m super worried about any short and long term effects of my complete stupidity as baby is EBF. Even on days I only have one of these stupid drinks, 205 mg feels like a lot. I even had these during late pregnancy! I am never having one again. 

Please tell me I haven’t put my baby’s health in danger!",1,1757645184.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

Samuel awoke in the deserts of ultraviolet light once more, called upon seemingly, as he looked around with a look of familiarity and bitterness; very obviously not liking the fact that he was once more dragged here. Walking around, he looked up to see if he could find me in the sky; looking down at him like I did before. While I did not make myself immediately known, I suppose that it would be wise to guess that The Unscathed one has grown used to my antics. I felt it pointless to delay much longer, “Good Evening, Unscathed One”. I greeted, looking physically upon the Unscathed one from my position in the skies.



He looked up, his expression puzzled as to why he was here. Why here indeed? I could hear the question before he ever spoke it, “I have been made aware of certain events and wish to simply talk with you. You deserve answers, do you not? If for no other reason than your support of my daughter” I spoke honest, and mention of my daughter seemingly brought a nervous air about him. Poor man and his emotions, I suppose.



“Answers…” he ruminated, shaking his head, “Fine. First thing’s first then, is there any way this can change?” 



“This?” I asked, amused confusion admittedly too potent in my tone, “Getting really tired of talking to the sky in this fucking desert. No offense intended, but I’ve been here too many times to be intimidated by any of this.”



“Done” was my immediate response. This plane, my domain, I decided to change based off of a familiar event that I held dear to me; associated with The Unscathed one. He wrote of a Coffee Shop, a place of relaxation and discussion, and thusly did I make it a beautiful afternoon within this shop. I gave myself form of human shape, although with no other to base it off of, I gave myself The Unscathed One’s form; save for runes across the arms and face.



“Should I be flattered?” he asked, referring to the similar form that was myself sitting across from him. Waving my hand I sighed in response, “I much prefer to have reference when I take a form. Yours was the closest” I clasped my hands together and looked across, “Now then. You have questions, Unscathed One?”



“Let’s start with the title, where did that come from?”



“A literal title. Despite living here, you were unscathed from experience and trauma. Put simply, the reason you don’t remember the nature of The Sanctuary is because it was taken from you.”



“By you?”



“Requested by your father, actually.” Poor Samuel went quiet at reference of him, “Back when he lived here, when you were hardly a child, the group known as The Collective attempted to indoctrinate your father; thus bringing him here. Free of a spirit and unique of a soul as his, we talked about the meaning of life for some time.”



“So you and Dad were buddies?”



“I’d like to think so” I could hear somber tone in my voice, “He was a truly special man, Samuel. Would you believe I missed him?”



“Me too…”  Sam nodded to himself before looking at me once again, “So he asked you to wipe the slate clean when we moved?” 



“Exactly right. Yours and your brother’s, in hopes that you two would have a chance to live normally without the traumas of this place scarring you. Henceforth, your title”. He looked at me and shook his head, satisfied with the answer despite how silly it seemed to him, “What’s the purpose of this place? Hell, what’s yours while I’m at it?”



“Do you not care for your perception of reality as you see it?” 



“Just answer the question.”



“Very well.” I gave a small smile, a part of me seeing what my daughter saw in the man, “The Sanctuary is a place where any that slip between realities cannot escape from. When an individual from a different reality somehow manages to stumble into anther, The Sanctuary exists as a zone to keep any that do this within the confines to ensure that their existence does not disturb the rest of the reality.”



“Would an example be Gary?”



“A ***perfect*** example would be Gary. Since he was out of place in the sanctuary, it was the job of The Sanctuary Guardian to decide what action to take. Aik’ithula, it seemed, allowed him to choose his own fate.” I could see Sam process all of this before nodding, “And your purpose?”



 “I am one of multiple brothers. The Hand, The Heart, The Maw, and myself: The Iris; all of us in charge of a different reflection of reality with a similar goal. We wish for perfect existence.” Samuel scoffed, a normal response to hearing that someone wants perfection, “I’m being serious.”



“And I’m being skeptical. You expect me to believe you have the interest of all life in mind? Isn’t your brother the reason Gary’s entire world was ***eaten***? Simply because you say it, powerful as you are, I’m supposed to accept it without wondering if that’s the ***genuine*** intention?” He sighed as I looked at him, “If you talked to my father for a single minute, he’d tell you exactly how he feels about people like you that talk about peace and equality.”



“Unlike them, I do not wish for more power when I have plenty. Your father educated me on your politics, I assure you.”



“Is that right? So how can I trust you?”



“Because I gain nothing from it. That is all there is to it.” I looked at Samuel as he gestured for me to continue, so I did, “My brothers all have different ways of going about it. Put simply, The Maw believes in the concept of destruction bringing creation.”



“Destroy and create until perfection inevitably happens?” I nodded in response, glad that he picked that up so quickly, “The Heart believes in love being the answer, acceptance bringing about perfection.” Sam shook his head at that one, “Absolute love would bring about absolute stagnation.” Hearing this, I leaned forward, gesturing for him to speak, “What I mean is that if everyone loves unconditionally, there’ll be no reason to improve as a person if they’re accepted regardless. Could you call an existence that refuses to do anything other than wallow in its own acceptance ‘perfection’? Love brings people to kill, to improve on occasion, and that’s all well and good. But ***everyone*** all banding together in the name of love sounds to me like it’ll just lead to either chaos or stagnation. Peace, if you're lucky; but not perfection.”



Based on his reaction, my smile was getting noticeable, he really was like his father, “Forgive me, it is fascinating to hear a human’s opinion. A unique perspective can go a long way. Now, to resume the explanation, The Hand is the most obvious, a subtle manipulation to reality to curate perfection.”



“Something something ‘modern society’ something something” Sam mumbled, nodding, “Samuel Clarke, that was hardly anything.”



“It’s the one that seems the most believable. The one that most of humanity already kinda would accept. One would call that God, even.” Sam rubbed his face as he sighed, it was clear that he was hiding most of his shock rather well; at this point being notorious for it as far as I was concerned, “And you?”



“My purpose is to watch and learn. Interact as little as possible, save for the Sanctuary, and see what existence does when left to its devices. Take notes of all of the history that transpires, so to speak”



“And do what with it?”



“Share my findings with my brothers in hopes that we can all use the knowledge to do better.” I looked at him as he rubbed his face with his hands, fingers rubbing the eyes, “And how many times have you done this so far?” 



“The first time has not even finished yet.” His sudden look of skepticism set in as I smiled in response, “Existence takes a shockingly long time to play out when there’s no hand in any part of it. So needless to say, I’m still taking notes; always and forever.”



Sam nodded, rubbing his head once more; clear to me that this dream was getting to him. Exasperated, he looked over once more, “So why call me here?”



“For a very simple reason, Samuel. It concerns my daughter.”",1,1757644963.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

You are probably very confused, you wake up at 6, open the emails app for 10-15, and all of a sudden you look it's hours passed the time you woke up. There are many Tips I can give you + there are tips in my Guide.

Some of the tips that I can give you are :

1) Try and organize emails through importance ( if the email is not really important and it takes more than 2-3 minutes to be checked and for you to reply to it, Skip it).

2) Wake up 30 mins - 1 hour earlier to start your day with emails with the coffee cup before working on the real work you got.

3) Find your peak hours ( Energy-wise ), but do not use it to read or reply to emails.

4) when you enter your Peak ours only think and work on Real projects, because the morning would start "" Just this one email "" , next thing you know you have gone through 30-60 emails and wasted all your Peak Hours.

5) When you finish reading the emails ( the important ones ), close the email app, close any distraction, and begin with your real work.

I hope you benefited from these advice, I have actually put down a full Guide about  Productivity and Time Management, this is the link for My Guide : [Productivity and Time Management](https://ebookswithhk.myshopify.com/products/the-productivity-reset-why-you-feel-busy-all-day-but-get-nothing-done),

Entry 1 – October 2nd, 2019
Morning – 7:12 AM
I didn’t get much sleep last night. Been working double shifts since the storm damaged the office. My body feels like it’s held together by coffee and duct tape. I remember telling myself I’d keep this journal just to track hours for overtime, but now I think I might need it for something else.
Afternoon – 3:45 PM
Got assigned to the equipment shed again. Nobody wants the shed because it’s too far out. Lonely stretch of blacktop, nothing around but pine and swamp. The shed smells like gasoline and damp wood. Mice get into the rags. You can hear them scratching if you sit still too long.
It’s quiet out there. Too quiet sometimes. The kind that makes you invent noises.
Evening – 9:05 PM
Something happened tonight.
I just finished stacking the cones into the bed of the truck. It was one of those nights where the fog rolls in thick, hanging low. I remember thinking I couldn’t see more than fifty feet past the fence. That’s when I heard it.
Whistling.
Three notes. A pause. Three notes again. Slow, deliberate, like somebody signaling.
At first I thought it was Mark, messing around. I shouted into the fog, “Real funny! You almost got me!” But no reply. Just the tune again, closer.
Night – 9:43 PM
The whistling got so close I could feel it in my chest. I swear the sound wasn’t traveling through the air like normal—it was… directional, like it bent around the fog.
I ducked into the shed and pulled the door shut. It’s got that old metal slide-lock. I jammed it into place with shaking hands. My flashlight beam shook across the tools, bouncing off the chainsaw blades.
That’s when I heard it right outside. Not just whistling anymore—something dragging. Like nails—or claws—scraping the siding in long, patient strokes.
I froze. Didn’t breathe. I could hear it breathing though. Heavy. Wet. Too close.
Late Night – 11:27 PM
It stayed there. For hours. At one point the lock rattled, not hard. Just enough to remind me it was there. Like it wanted me to know.
The worst part? I swear I heard it whisper my name. Not speak. Whistle it. The syllables bent into a tune.
I didn’t leave until sunrise. And when I finally stepped out, the fog had lifted. Nothing was there. Just scratches, deep and uneven, running the length of the shed wall.
I told myself I imagined it. But my gut says otherwise.

Entry 2 – October 3rd, 2019
Morning – 8:03 AM
Didn’t sleep again. Every time I shut my eyes, I hear that tune. It’s stuck in my head, like it’s not even mine to hum. My body keeps mimicking it against my will. I caught myself whistling it while I brewed coffee. Had to bite my tongue until I tasted blood just to stop.
I don’t like writing this down, but I need proof for myself that I’m not crazy.
Afternoon – 2:26 PM
Mark and Jensen didn’t show up to shift. Thought maybe they bailed, but by three the sheriff was on scene. Their work truck was still running by mile marker 12. Doors wide open. Chainsaw still idling in the ditch until it sputtered dry.
That was almost worse than blood. Like they’d just… evaporated.
Deputies walked the tree line with dogs, but the animals went mad. Barking, whining, refusing to enter the deeper woods. I stood back and noticed something on the truck’s hood: scratches. Five lines, deep and jagged, cut straight into the paint and metal. Too wide for a person’s hand. Too uneven for a tool.
Nobody said a word about it. But I caught one deputy staring at those gouges with a look I’ll never forget. Like he’d seen them before.
Evening – 7:40 PM
We regrouped at the shed. The others kept their voices low, like kids afraid of being overheard. Everyone knows something’s wrong, but nobody wants to name it.
I asked about the scratches and got nothing but silence. Then Rick muttered, “Don’t follow the whistle,” under his breath. He wouldn’t look me in the eye when I pressed him. He just repeated it once more, quieter, like it wasn’t advice—it was a memory.
Night – 10:11 PM
Went back home but couldn’t stay inside. Kept thinking about the spot where they disappeared. So I drove out to mile marker 12 with a flashlight. The fog was lighter tonight, but the woods felt heavier, if that makes sense.
I walked the ditch line. Found Jensen’s hardhat caught in a low branch, streaked with something dark. Sticky. Smelled like copper. I didn’t bring it back.
Then I heard it again.
Three notes. Pause. Three notes.
My flashlight caught movement in the trees—a tall shape, hunched over, as if listening. Couldn’t make out the face, but the shoulders were wrong. Too wide. And the way it tilted its head… like a bird hearing a distant sound.
It stopped whistling. Then something else started.
It mimicked me. I realized I’d been humming nervously, low in my throat. The thing in the trees hummed it back, broken and wheezy, like it was trying to learn the sound of me.
That was enough. I bolted for the truck. Didn’t even check the mirror while driving off.
Late Night – 1:03 AM
Back home now, but my hands won’t stop shaking. I locked every window and door. Turned off the lights. Sat in the dark, waiting.
For an hour, nothing. Then, faintly, from somewhere past the tree line at the back of my property—
Whistling.
The same damn tune.
It knows where I live.

Entry 3 – October 6th, 2019
Morning – 6:57 AM
I woke up with dirt under my fingernails. I don’t remember going outside last night, but there were muddy footprints by the back door—bare, not mine.
My tongue hurts. I must’ve been biting it again while I slept. Tasted iron all morning.
Coffee doesn’t do a damn thing anymore. The tune’s still stuck in my head. It’s like it rewires my thoughts, sneaking in when I’m too tired to fight.
Afternoon – 1:42 PM
Sheriff’s office held a “search party.” Mostly volunteers, walking the ditch line where Mark and Jensen vanished. They didn’t find anything but branches broken too high to be deer.
When everyone else moved on, I lingered. Something shiny caught my eye under a cluster of pines.
A glove.
Jensen’s, by the initials written on the cuff. Inside was… flesh. Just a strip of palm, jagged and wet, stuck to the lining like someone had peeled it away.
I almost vomited but shoved it back under the needles before anyone saw. I don’t know why. Maybe because if I told, they’d say I planted it. Maybe because part of me wishes I hadn’t seen it at all.
Evening – 8:19 PM
I will be trying to record it tonight. I parked my truck by the treeline, phone on the dash. I waited an hour, nothing. Then it started.
Three rising notes. Pause.
On the recording you can hear it clearly. But layered underneath the whistle is something else—breathing. Heavy, wet, like someone drowning slowly.
At one point, I hummed nervously under my breath. Seconds later, the whistling bent and copied me, out of rhythm, like it was testing the sound.
I froze. Didn’t even dare shift in my seat. That’s when my headlights caught it.
Tall. Shoulders hunched forward, arms too long, head cocked unnaturally sideways. Its skin looked pale, stretched. Couldn’t make out details—just outlines through the fog.
But the worst part? It was holding something. Dangling from its hand, swaying with each breath. It looked like a hardhat.
Night – 10:04 PM
I don’t think it likes to attack outright. It toys with you. Learns you.
As I sat there, staring, it raised its free hand—slow, deliberate—and dragged long fingers down the trunk of a pine. The sound of bark peeling filled the night. Then it turned. Not walked. Turned. Like its whole body pivoted in one unnatural motion, and it slipped deeper into the trees.
When I got home, the recording was still running. I replayed it with headphones. Past the whistle, past the breathing, there’s another noise, faint but real.
A voice. Mine.
It repeated my own humming back, distorted, like I’d recorded it twice. But I hadn’t.
Late Night – 2:04 AM
It’s outside the house now. I can hear it.
Not whistling. Humming.
My humming.

Entry 4 – October 8th, 2019
Morning – 7:22 AM
The news is everywhere: the mayor’s son was found dead two towns over. They won’t release details, but rumor is he was torn up so badly his own family couldn’t identify him. The cops are swamped with the case, stretched thin, and now anything short of murder isn’t even on their radar.
I thought about calling them last night when I heard it humming outside my window, but what would I even say? “There’s a man who whistles in my woods and copies my voice”? They’d laugh, or worse—lock me up.
Afternoon – 2:58 PM
Drove out to the shed to check supplies. The scratches on the siding are worse. Deeper. They run in patterns now, long vertical grooves that almost look deliberate, like someone carving symbols.
On the ground near the door I found feathers—crows. Snapped, bent, slick with something dark. When I touched one, my fingers came away sticky, red.
Inside, the air stunk. Sweet and rotten. I found the source tucked behind a stack of cones: a raccoon, throat slit clean open, chest cavity hollow. Organs gone. Its fur around the wound wasn’t just bloody—it was scorched, edges blackened like it had been burned from the inside out.
I dropped it and bolted outside, choking on my own bile. The whistle started almost immediately. Same three notes.
It wanted me to see that.
Evening – 9:31 PM
I can’t stay home anymore. I can’t sit in the dark waiting for that tune to drift through the trees. So I tried something stupid: I went looking for it.
Took the backroads past mile marker 12, into the thickest part of the pines. Parked, left the engine idling. I walked maybe thirty feet before the air shifted. You know that pressure before a storm breaks? Heavy, pressing on your eardrums? That.
And then: whistling.
Not far. Not deep in the woods this time. Right behind me.
I spun with my flashlight—and froze.
It was standing at the edge of the road.
Tall, hunched, arms so long the fingers brushed the gravel. Skin grayish, stretched thin over its frame. The face—God. Its jaw looked broken, hanging slightly open, lips torn. And when it whistled, the sound didn’t come from its mouth. It came from its throat. Like air through a flute.
It tilted its head at me, slow, listening. Then, in the exact pitch of my own voice, it hummed the broken tune I’d recorded days ago.
I stumbled backward toward the truck. That’s when it moved.
Not a walk. Not a run. A blur, like a film skipping frames. One second it was by the trees, the next it was halfway to me. My light caught its hand—too long, nails cracked and caked with dried brown. At the tips, flesh still clung, strips of something ragged. Fingers of someone else.
I don’t remember unlocking the truck, just slamming the door and flooring it.
Late Night – 12:11 AM
I’m writing this from the cab, parked outside a gas station on the far end of town. I don’t want to go home.
But even here, with people inside, bright lights overhead, I can still hear it faintly.
The whistle.
Somewhere out past the pumps.
And I swear every time I blink, I see it—just at the edge of the lot, too still, too tall, head tilted, listening.

Entry 5 – October 10th, 2019
Morning – 5:36 AM
I didn't sleep. I haven't slept more than an hour at a time in days. Every time my eyes close, I dream of him. Not chasing, not killing — just standing there. Watching. Whistling.
When I woke, the curtains in my bedroom were open. I don’t remember opening them. On the glass, fogged from my breath in the night, three streaks ran down. Long. Like fingers.
My knuckles ache from clenching so hard while I sleep. My teeth are chipped from grinding. My gums bleed when I spit.
I think my body is breaking down before he even touches me.
Afternoon – 1:14 PM
I tried to go into town. Needed groceries. Needed to feel normal, surrounded by people.
But as I stood in line, I realized I was humming under my breath again — the tune. An old woman in front of me turned her head slow, like she’d heard it before, eyes wide, and left her cart behind without paying.
When I walked out, there was a dead bird on my windshield. A crow. Its wings were pulled wide apart, pinned with roofing nails driven straight into the glass. The breast had been hollowed. Empty.
Nobody in the parking lot claimed to see who did it. But I knew.
He wants me alone.
Evening – 8:47 PM
The woods are louder now. Crickets stopped. Frogs gone. But there’s a rhythm—branches snapping, slow, deliberate, like footsteps.
I sat in the living room with all the lights off, recording again. For an hour, nothing. Then—soft, faint, but there—the whistle.
This time it didn’t stop outside. It moved through the house.
I could hear it travel. Kitchen. Hall. Bedroom. Each whistle closer, weaving through the walls. My heart nearly tore itself out of my chest.
But when I checked the doors, the locks were still in place. Windows latched. No sign of forced entry.
How did it get in?
Night – 11:55 PM
I just checked the recording.
It’s not just whistling anymore. There are other sounds layered in, things I didn’t hear in the moment.
Scraping, like fingernails on wood. A creak of the stairs. My own voice, whispering things I don’t remember saying:
“Let me in.”
“Don’t lock it.”
“Please.”
I don’t know if that’s me talking in my sleep, or him making me talk.
My mouth tastes like blood again. Tongue shredded.
And on the inside of the front door, scratched deep into the wood, are five letters:
HELLO.
I didn’t hear him carve it.

Entry 6 – October 13th, 2019
Morning – 6:44 AM
I woke up in my truck. Engine off. Keys in the ignition. My clothes are stiff with dried mud. No memory of leaving the house.
On the passenger seat was a dead rabbit. Its fur matted, stomach slit open. Inside the cavity was a strip of paper, folded tight. I didn’t want to touch it, but I couldn’t stop myself. My hands shook so bad it nearly tore.
One word, scrawled in dirt-colored ink:
“Sing.”
My throat feels raw. My lips are cracked. I don’t remember singing. But my voice is hoarse like I’d been screaming for hours.
Afternoon – 2:03 PM
I found footprints in the yard. Bare. Large. They start at the edge of the tree line and go straight to my back door. But there’s something wrong — each step is too long, like the legs don’t bend right.
Worse, there’s another set of prints. Smaller. Mine. Only… they don’t start at the house. They start beside his. And they follow his tracks all the way in.
I checked my shoes — clean. No mud. But my feet ache like I’d been walking barefoot all night.
Evening – 9:21 PM
Time slips. I’ll be staring at the clock, and then suddenly it’s an hour later, and I don’t remember blinking.
Tonight I woke from one of those gaps standing at the kitchen window, hands pressed hard against the glass. Outside, across the yard, he stood between the trees.
Tall. Still. Watching.
He whistled, and my breath matched the rhythm, automatic, like I was the instrument. I couldn’t stop. My chest tightened with each note. When he stopped, I stopped.
He raised his hand, long fingers twitching, and my hand lifted too, against the glass, mirroring him. Like a puppet.
When the spell broke, I stumbled back, gagging. My palm left a smear. Blood. I don’t know if it was mine.
Late Night – 12:47 AM
Something woke me. A smell. Copper, heavy. I followed it like sleepwalking.
In the bathroom sink, my hands were stained dark, under the nails packed with something fibrous. Flesh? Hair? I scrubbed until my skin tore. It won’t come off.
I don’t remember what I did. Where I went. But outside, faint through the night air, I hear it—
Not just whistling now.
Singing.
My own voice, carried back from the woods, broken and off-key, like he’s learning the words one syllable at a time.
And between verses, something else. Wet. Tearing. Feeding.
Alright — this is the breaking point. Entry 7 will be the narrator’s descent into full possession, where he realizes The Whistling Man isn’t just stalking anymore, but living through him. The gore will be implied but unavoidable, and the voice will start to fracture.

Entry 7 – October 16th, 2019
Morning – 9:12 AM
The gaps are longer. Bigger. I’m losing whole stretches of days.
I woke up this morning barefoot in the woods, clothes torn, lips cracked and bleeding. My throat feels raw, not from screaming — from whistling.
In my pocket was a tooth. Human. Molar. Still warm.
I don’t know if it’s mine. I don’t think it is.
Afternoon – 3:40 PM
I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror. Only — it didn’t whistle when I did. My mouth moved, my breath wheezed, but the reflection stayed still, jaw slack, until after I’d stopped. Then it whistled the tune back at me, perfect.
I smashed the mirror. Glass everywhere. Blood dripping from my knuckles.
But in the shards on the floor, all of them — every angle — it still stood behind me. Tall. Tilted. Waiting.
Evening – 7:56 PM
I blacked out again. Came to in the shed. The smell was unbearable — copper, rot, smoke.
On the workbench lay a shape. Wrapped in tarp. Heavy. My hands were on the hammer, sticky, trembling. I don’t want to write this but I have to — the tarp shifted. Something inside. Flesh, wet and ruined. Pieces, not whole.
And I knew — I did this. Or maybe he did, through me.
Whistling filled the shed, but my lips weren’t moving. My chest rose and fell in rhythm, lungs dragging air through like a flute. My ribs vibrated with the tune. He was inside me, using me.
Night – 11:33 PM
It’s not outside anymore. It’s not even in the house.
It’s in me.
I feel his fingers when I move. Long. Patient. Stretching through my own. When I speak, the words crackle like static, not mine. My jaw aches. It clicks, pulls, hangs. Sometimes I catch myself tilting my head too far, listening the way he does.
And the worst part — I like it. The tune isn’t stuck in my head anymore. It is my head. Every thought bends around it, every heartbeat in sync.
I don’t know if I’m writing this to warn anyone or to remember what it felt like before he took me.
Because now, when I close my eyes, I don’t see the woods or the shed or my own house.
I see through his.
I see you.

Morning – ?
I don’t know the time. The clocks don’t tick right anymore. They skip, like film reels missing frames.
The handwriting is different. Not mine. Long strokes, jagged curves. I keep trying to steady my hand, but something else guides it.
let me sing
That wasn’t me. That line just appeared as I wrote. My wrist bent wrong, pulled too hard, tearing the page.
Afternoon – [crossed out]
I black out while writing now. The words keep going even when I don’t mean them. Sentences I don’t think, but there they are:
you are the whistle you are the throat you are the song
The letters stretch longer, darker, pressed so hard the paper rips. The tune is in the ink.
Evening – …
He’s not outside. He’s not in the shed. He’s not in the woods.
He’s at the desk.
He’s in the pen.
He’s in my mouth.
Every time I breathe, it comes out a note. Every time I blink, I see through his eyes—tall, hunched, watching something. Watching you.
My reflection hums when I don’t. My hands move when I don’t.
I tried to stop writing but the pen won’t—
HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO
Night – [illegible scrawl]
I feel him stretching my jaw wider. Wider than it should go. Skin tearing. Teeth cracking.
He’s coming through.

Some include built-in fridges, Bluetooth speakers, LED lighting, or wireless charging pads, while others focus on minimalist designs with hidden storage or touch controls.

I even browsed some designs on Alibaba to see the variety ..tables range from simple setups with a few tech perks to fully loaded models with multiple gadgets. Sobro is one of the more well-known examples, but there are plenty of interesting alternatives.

I’m curious how useful these tables actually are day-to-day. Which features do you genuinely use, and which feel more like novelty? Are simpler designs more practical, or do fully featured tables make sense for those who like tech-enhanced furniture?

[$AUD1100],"Greetings, I’m looking for a decent espresso grinder and have owned a Eureka before (a specialita). For my budget I’m also open to looking at other brands 

Right now I have a breville machine 58mm and a 51mm lever machine I’ve just bought. 

I tend to change beans often although it’s possible for me to stick with one supplier for ease of workflow too - I like trying different beans, but if I find something I love I’ll stick with it for a while 

At this point I feel drawn to the ease of grind-by-weight with the Libra, but I am unsure how compatible it’ll be with the 51mm portafilter as reviews say it tends to kinda spray coffee a little - and the dosing funnel I assume won’t fit. Not sure how big an issue this may or may not be 

I am drawn to the single dose grinder as it seems easy to switch beans if I want to, and I like to refrigerate beans for freshness, but since I haven’t owned a single dose grinder before I’m unsure if the change in workflow will suit or not. Again, maybe that’s not such a big deal and I’m overanalysing 

Maybe the choice is just more so depending on if I am happy to stick with one bean supplier, or not, but would love anyone’s experience with either machine too

I have never tried any other type of kratom other than the plants I have grown from seed. Kratom is not available where I live for purchase. 

From a plant that was grown from seed, and is only around 1.5years old, ive tried tea and chewing on multiple occasions.

With the tea, I normally use 20g of fresh leaves straight from tree. I blend them with lemon juice and let it sit for 10mins, the add to a pot and VERY lightly simmer on and off for about 30mins. I never really let it ‘boil’ and try to keep temp between 80-90c. After it cools I filter the leaf out with a strainer bag and put in fridge. Drinking this on ice with non alcoholic ginger beer tastes literally delicious to me. 

I find the effect from the above made tea to be quite potent. I generally will drink it over the course of a few hours, and find it feels like an incredibly soothing blanket of calm, while also feeling awake but not ‘stimulated’. 

Chewing 3 leaves felt similar to a nice stimulating coffee without the jitters and a stronger ‘mood boost’ effect. 

Overall I am absolutely in love with this plant and find the potency of a 1.5 old tree grown from seed to be remarkable. ",2,1757644122.0,KratomGarden,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with them and the items, but won't have pictures because I just don't photograph well. 

First, Sizing: when they say ""size up"" they aint fucking around. Know your measurements and check their sizing matrix on each item because they aren't all sized the same. I'm not particularly tall, but I am a little doughy, so I went up on all the items, and boy I am glad I did.

Second, ordering and customer service: Their website is easy to use, and their email communication was good. They reached out to me after I submitted my order to make sure I was 100% about the sizes. After confirming that I ordered the right stuff, it took just short of two weeks to get my stuff. These items are straight up Chinese, so just live with that.

Third, packaging: Even though this is a Chinese company selling American's wannabe Japanese style retro Americana, they hide it well. Each item was in a separate plastic bag, the labeling was all in English, and they had very Army Surplus feeling tags on them. They definitely nailed the vibe.

Now for the items.

9 oz US Cotton Tubular T-Shirt, Coffee (XXL) - The color is exactly what I was expecting; a light old school brown. The weight feels nice and dense. For an XXL it just fits me even though I usually wear an XL or L. For only $25 it seems like a good shirt, but honestly not that different from something you could get at Uniqlo.

Loopwheel Tubular Atheltic T-Shirt, Gray (XL) - these run a little bigger than the 9 oz shirts and have a very similar feel. It is maybe a touch lighter and smoother, but we also know these aren't true loopwheel shirts and are made on an updated version of the classic loopwheel machines. Nice color, good shirt, could still be a Uniqlo shirt 

Vintage Long Sleeve Henley, White (XXL) - I rolled the dice a little here since white henley shirts can look bad on me because of my chest hair. Luckily this shirt is thick and dense. It is also crazy small. Even at a XXL it barely fits me right. I will have to be very careful how I wash it. It looks nice and will layer well. It is heavy like the T-Shirts and will be very cozy in cold weather.

1960s AUS Arm Combat Pants, Brown (36) - This is the only one I'm a little disappointed in. The brown is more green\\gray then I would have liked, and it has no belt loops. It is also the snuggest 36 waist I have ever purchased. I am muffin topping out of it big time. However, the legs are pretty wide, so a 38 seems like it would be too much. Again, I will have to be very carefully washing these and hope my waistline holds its ground. The material feels rugged without being stiff or scratchy, I usually wear a 30L and these are a little long, but cuffing them is par for the course.

  
So, overall, I like what I got and if I buy more from them will need to be extra careful with the sizes. The quality for the price is good as long as buying Chinese manufactured goods doesn't bother you, and things in the US don't reach a point were tariffs make them too expensive.

I've put some tape on the wall for two different size TVs we're considering. That wall itself is 15-feet wide and we intend to sit about 11-12 feet back from the TV.

We haven't locked our couch in yet, but it will either be a dark green or a navy blue sectional. It will be an L shape against the left wall

A few things I could really use help with to start:  
\- Suggestions for a long, low console of some sort below the TV, which will likely be an 85-inch TV that is 74"" or so wide. I would likely set a soundbar on top of the console. 

\- Suggestions for a coffee table

\- Suggestions for some curtains that would look good against our walls/floors (Paint color is SW Greek Villa)

My daily driver is a M4 Mac Mini 32/512. Recently picked up a MBA M4 15 inch 16/512 because i needed something i could carry around the city and travel without dying on me after 3 hours of use and wanted some screen real estate.

  
Coming from a M1 MBA 13 inch, I love the 15 inch size and with my main tasks being me dealing with spreadsheets - models, automations and formulas. they seems to be eating up alot of RAM on the MBA M4 16/512 and has been hitting swap memory for a light to mod workload. In addition, i had slack, zoom and other browser tabs open which only causes more RAM usage. 

It sounds like 15 inch with more RAM makes more sense but I have some traveling coming up in a few months that will cause me to more on-the-go than i am right now. This means i will be mostly on planes, cars and coffee shops. 

  
So here are my choices

\- 13 inch with 24/512

\- 15 inch with 16/512 (what i currently have)

\- 15 inch with 24/512

  
my budget is sub 1500 but it is makes sense to get the 15 inch 24/512 more than $1500, i will have to.

1nere21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nere21,Eufy Tip: Eufy labs E28 and others,"Hey fellow Eufy users! Thought I would share a quick tip to get the list out of your e25 or e28. This may apply to other Eufy models so check it out! I'm talking about the ""eufy labs"" section in app. This section surfaces new features they are testing that you can enable, some last a day some become permanent features in future updates. This post will be about 2 settings I think you should enable to get the most of your bot and ensure your floors are as clean as possible.

1. Dirty spot cleaning: This feature is a must enable. During a cleaning cycle the robot will use its camera to monitor the floor for stains or large piles of debris (for me it's often coffee grounds). When detected the robot will adjust its cleaning setting like max suction and go over the same area multiple times in multiple directions ensuring  the area get cleaned. It will then return to the base and wash the mop and empty the dustbin before continuing. I found this works better on lighter floors or at night with darker floors because the led light highlights messes. There is no downside the enabling this making it a must enable in my opinion.

2. Dirt inspection: This feature is interesting and actually moved back into the beta menu recently. Its basically a double check of the room after a clean. Its actually caught a few things for me like dog food it missed or an obstacle that I moved. 2 catches with this one the first being it only check after a full house clean, doing a room clean won't activate the feature. I wish it check after each individual task. Second is it drives wide paths through each room. While effective it takes a bit of time so you have the have enough battery remaining to do it. That being said there is little downside outside the battery so turn it on and let it check it's work. 

I hope it helps some e25 and e28 owners who have never been in that menu. These features made a huge difference in a milk spill I covered in a previous post listed below. Happy vacuuming.

I walked up to him and said ""You're John Lithgow!"" and we started talking, then we just hung out in the mall, taking snapchat pictures with all kinds of funny filters.

He was so overly nice and happy to me, and nobody bothered him at all despite the mall being quite crowded.

I showed him pictures of my family and he seemed genuinly interested, and I talked a bit about Interstellar which is my favorite movie. He might have mentioned he was sick, like cancer or so, and that he was glad someone showed this kind of appreciation to him.

After a while my brother came up to us and saw John, and apparently John had been in a Star Wars movie. My brother said this to him: Is that who I think it is, ""Mr. Doobie Wan""? 🤣
By this time we had to go, so I wanted to take some normal selfies with John, but my camera had all sorts of weird settings so it was impossible. We tried his phone but couldn't either.

Then I woke up, and this was around 20 minutes ago. I remember looking at my phone around 3:15 am and woke up from the dream 3:49 am.

Anyway, just wanted to share this, truly amazing dream with John Lithgow.

I live in Sweden so meeting him randomly in a mall would've been even more improbable in real life haha

It was a dark and starless night. Olivia moved quietly through the woods, her electric bike buzzing softly beneath her. The terrain was broken and riddled with bumps, forcing her to fix her goggles once again.

There were no roads at this side of the border, even if she could use them. Mutants had no use for roads, not when their legs outran mankind’s bikes.

Yes, it was a risk.

Olivia twisted the throttle, making the bike buzz louder.

But such was the job of deep-diving scouts like her.

Light at the corner of her eyes. It wasn’t bright, but in this darkness, it was bright enough.

She followed it, slowing down as the lights multiplied in the distance, then stopped at the forest’s edge.

The ruins of a building, lit at various spots.

Olivia pulled an old spyglass from her jacket and opened it, bringing it to her eye.

“There you are,” she whispered.

Figures walked in and out of the ruins, their thick, unnaturally colorful skins glowing from the campfires inside. A few of them flew instead—those winged ones were particularly troublesome for her.

Olivia turned off the bike, then resumed scanning the place.

They busied themselves with their weapons, sharpening them, making new ones. Mostly spears and clubs, but there were some looted guns as well.

Olivia frowned, stopping the spyglass at a particular mutant that sat by one of the campfires—blue skinned, with spike-like growths along his arms. A spear rested against his shoulder. Something strange in his hands.

*Explosives?*

Unlikely. He was spinning and poking at it, a bomb would have detonated by now. No, he seemed to be making it.

Another creature called him from behind. His fingers drifted aside as he turned to answer, revealing the small object underneath them.

It was oval, made of unpainted wood. A pair of wings amateurishly carved on it.

She knew that shape well. It was a common one in coming-of-age celebrations back home.

*What is it doing here?*

Olivia shook her head and closed the spyglass.

A rustle of wings above.

She held her breath, waiting for the flying mutant to leave, then pulled a stained notebook and compass from her jacket once it was gone.

Olivia had the map in her head already.

Her eyes lingered on the compass for a while, letting the nettle settle down completely…

It stopped.

She snapped the compass shut and took the notebook. A retractable sharpie attached to the binding.

*Click.*

Coordinates on the page.

*Click.*

She glanced at the ruins one last time, then returned the notebook to her pocket.

And just like that, with the stroke of a sharpie, the mission was a success.

Olivia flicked the key, turned the handlebars, and drove away with a buzz.

 

⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘



“Are you sure, Liv?” Her colleague said, holding the edge of the notebook. “If these coordinates are even *slightly* off the upper brass is going to kill me.”

Paris wore a ragged aviator cap. A few rusty medals on his chest.

“I might have mixed up the numbers,” she said with a smirk. “It happens.”

“Don’t play with me, Liv.” He put the notebook in his pocket. “Rockets are bloody hard to come around.”

“I’m just a scout.” She shrugged. “What can I do?”

Paris turned and walked away, but he didn’t stop complaining.

“Everything’s hard to come around. If only we had more bullets for those freaks…”

Olivia chuckled, stretching wide. But as the grumpy pilot disappeared into the crowd, she realized she had come home earlier than expected. Her next assignment was only in a few days.

*Now what?*

She looked around. The HQ’s cafeteria was lively in the early morning, buzzing with a cacophony of footsteps and low chatter. Soldiers with makeshift rifles, nurses in patched up uniforms, clerks…

Coffee. That’s what she needed.

There was a machine beside the entrance.

She crossed the room and placed a mug under the dispenser.

Childlike voices reached her as the coffee poured. There was a school nearby.

Olivia took the steamy mug and blew it, before taking a sip.

“How can machine coffee taste like socks?” she muttered.

Who knew? Everything was hard to come around.

The voices grew louder, then a group of chatty kids stormed through the open gates beside her. She happened to know the loudest of them, the bee right at the head of the swarm.

Olivia arched a stern eyebrow at him.

Marcus froze as he saw her, the rest of the students continuing without him.

“I can explain,” he said.

She lowered the cup.

“What are you even doing here? Where’s your teacher?”

“The class is doing a tour through the military installations. We just went ahead of him, that’s all.”

Olivia breathed easily again.

“Right. Not as bad as I imagined.”

“Told you. Save for the fact we locked Mr. Brown in the classroom.”

“Excuse me?”

He raised his hands. Something bulged slightly through his shirt. A necklace of sorts.

“Joking!”

She stared at him, speechless, then sighed.

“How was your party yesterday? I’m sorry I missed it. Happy birthday, by the way.”

He scratched his head, a worried look on his face.

“Yeah, I know you’re busy, Oli. I… I’m just glad you’re okay.”

She smiled and messed up his hair slightly.

“Of course I’m okay. Do you think a measly mutant would be match for mankind’s greatest scout?”

“Yeah, right.” Marcus snorted at her jest, but his eyes weren’t as amused. “Is it true that the mutants act like us sometimes? I mean… Doesn’t that mean they are smarter than we give them credit for?”

Olivia blinked.

“Our enemies are cunning mimics, that’s for sure. They imitate human behavior to trick us. But I already know that, so don’t worry about me.”

Marcus looked at her in silence, then nodded.

“Alright.”

It didn’t seem he believed her entirely.

“Anyways, show me what you got for your thirteenth birthday,” she said.

“Sure, but I got just one thing with me right now.”

Marcus reached under his shirt through the collar and pulled something into view.

A metallic necklace, oval-shaped with wings, fully painted.

The pitch-black coffee swayed in the cup beneath.

Olivia looked down, staring at it in silence.

“I should make my own coffee,” she said. “This one tastes like socks, did you know that?”

Marcus frowned, pulling the thing back inside his shirt.

“No, I didn’t—”

Shouts coming from outside.

A breathless, disheveled man burst through the entrance. His shirt was frayed on the shoulder, as if he’d slammed it against a door multiple times…

Marcus’ eyes shot wide.

“I gotta go,” he said and bolted after his class.

Mr. Brown ran after the pranksters, cursing them.

Paris returned. He stopped beside her, watching the chaos unfold in the cafeteria with her, notebook in hand.

“I don’t know what to do with this kid,” she said. “His father was a good soldier, but I’m not sure I’m the right person for the job. I mean, I’m barely at home with all the missions.”

“Don’t overthink it,” Paris said. “At least he has someone to look after him. I didn't have anybody.”

She nodded.

“You’re right.”

“Of course I am. Anyways.” He turned to face her. “We got them.”

“Got who?”

“Who? The mutants, of course!”

“Already?”

“Yep. Already.” Paris handed her the notebook back. “The entire hideout was blown to pieces. Not a single rocket wasted.”

Her eyebrows arched.

Olivia took the notebook.

“That’s… great news. Do you think we’ll be able to push that front further now?”

Paris raised his palms, laughing.

“Whoa, slow down there, partner. It’s not that simple. But…” he said, sticking his hands inside his pockets. “It’s going to cost us a lot less now. Thanks to you, Liv.”

She nodded with a smile.

He turned, walking the same way he came. Complaining.

“I wish I had done it myself, though…”

Olivia sat down on the table behind her, yawning despite herself.

The image of a poorly carved wooden necklace came to her mind.

It disappeared when she rubbed her eyes. Tired.

*I… need a nap, not coffee.*

She abandoned the mug, some cold coffee still swirling at the bottom, and left.

*By the stroke of a sharpie…*

1nerd0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1nerd0l/prohamas_comments_by_english_teacher_anything_i/,Pro-Hamas comments by English teacher— anything I can do about this?,"Hi all. I hope it is okay for me to post here, I’m not Jewish but I don’t really know where else I can go. It feels like no one is taking this seriously. 

I’m currently in high school. Yesterday during my AP Literature class, we were having a discussion about the Odyssey and the moral complexities of the different characters. The teacher specifically mentioned a passage towards the beginning of the book where someone asks Telemachus if he is a pirate. He started talking about how different people can perceive certain actions differently, and using real-world figures and organizations as examples. One of the organizations he mentioned was Hamas. I don’t mean that he was like, “oh yeah, and also Hamas,” which would be its own kind of fucked-up, but he went on a *whole tangent* about how Hamas was a prime example of how “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.” While he did acknowledge the “grievous crimes” that it has commmitted against the state of Israel, he went on to say that they are acting in defense of the Palestinian state and it’s all a matter of perspective. I did not think this was appropriate and I sent a strongly-worded email to the school principal about this incident, including links to information about Hamas, October 7, and the statements of different national agencies that recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. The principal wrote back telling me to meet with him tomorrow and we would discuss. 

Today I came in for our meeting and the principal asked me more about what had happened and what the teacher said. I relayed the story to him and he said he would talk to the teacher, but the overwhelming sentiment was that I was being sensitive and I should learn to live with discomfort because sometimes people say things we don’t like. The man was justifying the actions of a registered terrorist organization, I don’t think that’s just an “opinion I don’t like”! The principal asked if I had talked to the teacher about it and I said no. He asked if I felt unsafe and I (stupidly) said I didn’t, just worried for other students because this wasn’t cultivating a welcoming environment. Which wasn’t a bad response, necessarily, but maybe I should’ve said that I did feel unsafe, that my teacher was speaking in defense of a terrorist organization, just so this could have been taken more seriously. Like, I genuinely don’t think the teacher would do anything, he’s a high-school English teacher, but I also don’t think this should be just a slap-on-the-wrist thing where they talk about it over coffee. There is no way the principal would be this chill about it if he’d said the same things about any other terrorist organization, like can you imagine?

I’ve already submitted an incident report to the ADL but I’m worried there’s nothing else I can do. I can’t believe this is not being taken more seriously, I feel like I’ve entered some kind of upside-down world. I’m going to keep showing up for class and doing the work because it’s too late in the semester to drop out, but maybe it would have been true if I said I felt unsafe. I certainly don’t trust the teacher anymore. I don’t know where to turn. I can’t imagine how it feels to be Jewish right now, I am so sorry. Please let me know if there’s anyone I can reach out to that might help with this situation at my school. If I was this upset, I’m sure it must be ten times worse for any Jewish students being exposed to the same rhetoric by their teacher. ",26,1757643428.0,Jewish,6,0.93,False
1nercwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nercwn/my_20m_longtime_friend_19f_is_starting_to_get_a/,My (20M) longtime friend (19F) is starting to get a little bit flirty.,"Hey all.
I’ve asked a few people about this situation in the past— I’ve been friends with this girl for like 7 years, and this behavior has gone on roughly 1.5-2. 
We have always been very close— we met when we were a lot younger and have been friends (more or less) since. We have definitely had our ups and downs but we love each other’s company. We spend a lot of time together and have especially so the last year and a half. We do kind of relationship-y stuff, go to coffee shops, help each other with hobbies, and she’s spent a lot of time at my place. 
Recently, (starting a year-ish ago) I’ve noticed a lot of flirty/intimate behavior from her. Some examples are: 
- A lot of play fighting
- cuddling
- teasing me about things I’ve admitted to finding hot
- tickling me and simultaneously climbing all over me
- proposing a “marriage pact”
- all the subsequent conversations that follow a “marriage pact”
Just to name a few.
I feel like she is physical with me in a way that most women are only physical with people they are attracted to. The trouble for me, is deciding whether or not to ask about it or make a move out of fear I mistook our closeness for intimacy/ a desire for intimacy. She is very attractive, but I honestly don’t mind the state of the friendship as is; I like a little bit of physical contact sometimes and I enjoy how close we are. To be perfectly clear, we have messed around a few times before, but due to a lack of maturity in both parties, it went south pretty quickly. I want to address this because I feel like there is a high amount of tension pretty much all of the time. 
Another important note: I’m a little bit self conscious— I feel like this might be skewing my viewpoint a little and messing with my head, especially if she’s waiting for me to do something (which, if she’s interested, is exactly what she’d do.)

How should I address this, if at all?

TLDR;
We are longtime friends and are very close, but I’ve been noticing flirty-ish behavior as of late, and it’s causing some tension between the two of us, to the point where I’d like to address it somehow.

She at first had offered to help him but then it was that she paid for everything, it was thrown in his face constantly even tho he was with all of the children the majority of the time, worked, etc. From what I know and others have told me, she was cruel regarding making him feel bad about money and making sure he knew that she paid for everything. I had been told this when we started dating about that dynamic.  I honestly ft bad for him, I Had dated and lived with a man prior who controlled my life financially and emotionally/verbally abused me daily over money. I
Worked, contributed, but (for example but also true) we would make a list for grocery shopping, and if I picked up something not on the list, he would lose his mind. It got to a point I couldn’t walk anywhere but directly beside him or he would be bothered. The entire drive home would be him complaining about what we had spent, if something that had not been on “the list” was purchased.  
I didnt grow up in a home 
Or a family where somebody did weekly grocery shopping.  I love lists but i also couldn’t care less if the list ends up a few extras. Back to my current husband and a pattern I’ve noticed developing. He loves to point out that he pays for most of our lives. He has a great job now and does well. 
We do not live outside our means, no expensive trips, I work, honestly I don’t shop often or even consistently get my nails done.  I fully admit he pays for most things, while I have taken on paying for a lot of the stuff for child, who is older now but I’ve helped raise and spent more than I would ever admit on.  It also needs to be noted that we are older and I came into the relationship with my own prior life and bills.  Whenever there’s a fight or disagreement, he will scream at me to get out of his house and tell me that he pays for everything.  I guess i am just surprised That he does this to me after how he was treated and I wonder are all men this way? I pay what I can, obv yes I spend here and there, I will ask him at times for money for breakfast/coffee. That’s brought up often to me.  I’m extremely grateful for how hard he works and tell him often.  There isn’t all this wasting of money that goes on. He makes so much more than I do i guess i look at it Iike no it’s not fair, but he also knew that I was never going to make what he does. I could never contribute the same. He minimizes what I do.  But  the constant pointing out i just find insulting and cruel. I’m wondering if all men do this? ",1,1757642873.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Super frustrated to feel in worse conditioning even after losing my first 20 lbs.

After much trial and error, I Finally found a meal plan that seems to work for me and thought I would share. Suggestions + tweaks welcome.

32 oz water upon waking up

--Big protein/fat breakfast (6am for me)--
4 eggs 
1 heaping spoonful of cottage cheese
(Mix together then scramble)
1 scoop mashed avocado 
(add after cooking eggs)
100 calories of pineapple

--3-4 hours later (9-10am)--
15g protein shake w/ some instant coffee

More water

--2-3 hours later (12:30 pm)--
--Now the day transitions toward carbs--
1.5-2 cups White rice (yes, white)
4-6 oz protein -- i use diced chicken breast or cubed steak 

--4 hours later (4:30p)--
--This is the meal that blows my mind as it breaks all my diet rules on normal days, but this is key to this energy loading day--
A turkey sandwich on 2 slices of shitty, processed white bread (yes)
No cheese nor mayo allowed.
--You can use some mustard but i go dry--
Small (1/2 kids snackbag sized) serving of salted pretzels 

--1 hour later (5:30pm)--
1000mg sodium LMNT hydration packet muxed into two large glasses of water (double the dilution)

--1 hour before the match (6:30 pm)--
1 banana

This has had an almost magical effect on my match stamina, even in high heat, even on tte day of the shot (taken upon waking up)

Its geared for evening matches. I havent figured out how to fuel up the same way for AM matches, so I just stopped scheduling them.

This is obviously not the most well balanced, healthy diet. But it's all I've found to accomplish my goal of getting through 1.5-2 hours of tennis. Works great for me. Sharing the news.",1,1757642837.0,zepboundathletes,1,1.0,False

1ner2mb,https://i.redd.it/nxhclf695nof1.jpeg,Don't confuse them anymore!,"Many people who use the Apple Watch or HRV app often have questions:

""I'm in a good mood today, so why is my HRV so low?""

Or

""Does a high HRV mean I'm completely stress-free?""

👇👇👇

Today, the Relax Watch team explains a commonly misunderstood point:

HRV ≠ Mental Stress; it reflects the body's ""Mental Stress"" state.

💡 So what exactly does HRV stand for?

HRV stands for heart rate variability.

It doesn't ""measure whether you're happy or not,""

but rather assesses the state of your autonomic nervous system.

Specifically, it measures the balance between the sympathetic nervous system (tension) and the parasympathetic nervous system (relaxation).

For example:

You're binge-watching a TV series and laughing heartily, but you've been staying up late and fueled by coffee → HRV is low.

You just had a tearful moment and are completely devastated, but meditating for a while and your body relaxes → HRV actually increases.

So, it measures your body's resilience, not your outward appearance of happiness.

✅ So is HRV useful?

It's incredibly useful! You just have to use it correctly:

HRV trend > single highs and lows

Compare to your past > compare to others

Combined with lifestyle habits, sleep patterns, and fatigue levels

🔹 Stress monitoring: Lower HRV indicates stress (perhaps fatigue, anxiety, or staying up late), while higher HRV indicates relaxation.

🔹 Sleep recovery: Upon waking, HRV reflects how well you rested last night.

🔹 Lifestyle feedback: High-intensity work, mood swings, and your body's response to exercise can all be seen through HRV. 🔹 Long-term trend tracking: It's not about striving for ""higher is better,"" but about whether you're more stable and resilient than you were yesterday.

In Relax Watch, we use real-time HRV readings from the Apple Watch and combine them with sleep, meditation, and other data.

Not only does it tell you your current physical state, but it also provides timely reminders:

""Hey, it's time to take a break.""

🫶 Final Word:

Don't get anxious about a low HRV one day,

nor ignore fatigue because of a high HRV.

True relaxation comes from responding to the signals your body sends you.

💬 How do you understand HRV? Do you get anxious about the numbers?

Furthermore, I noticed that some doctrinal aspects didn't completely convince me. I therefore maintained an imprecise idea of ​​God, the afterlife, and morality for years, without identifying with a specific church.

One thing I've firmly believed in, even before I discovered the doctrine of the LDS Church are the plan of salvation and eternal marriage. For me, the idea of ​​getting married and having a family has always been my sole purpose. I've done everything in this capacity, and, also being obsessed with chastity, I abstained from dating until I felt financially ready to date and marry.

And here's where my tragedy began. 

Years ago, out of curiosity, I downloaded Tinder. I even had the crazy idea of ​​paying for the basic subscription to try out various European countries where I'd find more matches. Various subsequent events led me to actually move to the country where I found the most matches. 
And I, despite knowing some of the annoying politically correct dynamics of this country, was convinced that with an average of 50 matches a day I could make a selection and find one.

But the real mistake wasn't thinking there might be disagreements on political issues, but thinking that my idea of ​​looking for someone to be with forever was common. The labels ""serious relationship,"" ""someone for life,"" and so on are new on these apps compared to when I tried them years ago. And they're in the minority compared to ""I don't know,"" ""Nothing serious,"" and so on.

So small a minority that my Tinder matches dropped by 90%. On other apps where I can filter only those looking for marriage, with a maximum range, there were fewer than five people. I became so paranoid that no one could ever be as interested as I was that I seriously considered suicide. And it stopped me to think that this suffering I'm feeling could become eternal.

So I thought about getting back into religion, hoping to find a community of like-minded people. And I'm realizing I'm much more extremist than all the mainstream churches, and in many ways even than the LDS Church. Law of chastity? I've never had any kind of romantic physical contact. Words of wisdom? I don't drink coffee, tea, alcohol, or smoke. And I'm also against energy drinks. R-rated movies? As a child, I was always bothered by scenes where eroticism was freely shown. I haven't turned on a TV in at least five years.
Temple garment? Not only have I never worn shorts or sleeveless shirts, but I almost exclusively wear formal dresses. Mark of Cain? Probably one of the few things where I'm slightly less extreme than Brigham Young. I think God created us different and that it's our duty to maintain this diversity. However, the church has radically changed its opinion on this, and I fear it may do the same on other things.

What I notice is that the church is increasingly moderate in its terms and cerimonies, the tendency is to please others so as not to be labeled as a cult.

And more and more unclean things are at risk of being accepted. And this scares me, because joining a church and finding a wife in it is for me an investment for the future. The first verse from the Book of Mormon that struck me and that I liked was this:
1 Nephi 10:21 
Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation⁠, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.

And I believe this to the extreme. For me, anything that isn't morally clean should be removed from my view. And I tend to be alone because most of the people I've met have unclean behavior.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

1neqv1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1neqv1u/has_sleeping_to_podcasts_all_night_for_the_last/,Has sleeping to podcasts all night for the last year been the cause of my anxiety/low motivation?,"Hey y’all,

I wasn’t sure where else to ask this that might have people who are well educated enough on the subject to provide me some insight, so I’m asking y’all!

So sometime last summer, I started getting in the habit of falling asleep to spooky podcasts, my favorite. Love to listen during the day, but figured ghost shows with people’s paranormal experiences would be a good mindless thing to listen to while falling asleep. I never set a sleep timer though because the stories always knocked me out quick and I liked to wake up to go to the bathroom and have them still running while I went back to sleep in the middle of the night. I also only ever listen with one earbud in if that matters. 

So around this time last year and intermittently since, I have dealt with higher baseline anxiety. Like, things I never used to even think or worry about now made me anxious. I was afraid to go lift heavy weights despite loving the gym, be in crowded places for too long, take long drives or trips. I genuinely felt like I was very easily overstimulated. I also was getting easily eight plus hours of sleep, but feeling groggy all morning and wanting to take midday naps. I never took naps before this last year. I also felt like I was needing more caffeine despite always capping myself around 400-500mg no matter what. I quit drinking over four years ago because I was having a fifth five nights a week, and this anxiety has been very comparable to my hangover anxiety and initial withdrawal anxiety the first month or two I quit. 

 Now I have tried so many things to deal with this anxiety. I quite taking any edibles, even to fall asleep at night (I was having 10-20mg of THC a few times a week). Thinking weed was the issue, and it may have contributed, but I quit that months ago and still have these issues. I dropped my caffeine consumption way down, from 500-600mg on lifting days, to maybe 100-200mg, and days where I have absolutely none. I lowered my screentime, I went on more walks, I tried to be more mindful, I cut out processed foods, artificial sweetener, ate mostly whole foods and used tracking apps to make sure I was getting my micronutrients from the whole foods I was eating. Some stuff seemed to work temporarily, but the anxiety was always there in the background, just waiting to be an issue again.

 That brings me to this week. I had a night where I didn’t use earbuds because I was genuinely so tired I forgot to even do my podcast ritual. The next day I felt pretty good, no morning grogginess, no anxiety throughout the day over silly things, just generally good. So I wanted to figure out why. I hadn’t changed anything about my lifestyle or diet, right? Except for the podcasts all night! I slept with my tv playing sportscenter on mute all night, no audio stimulus of any kind. I realized that I had done the same with I went out of town on a trip with my girlfriend a couple months back. Three nights of just falling asleep to the sounds of nature outside, no earbuds of podcasts playing in my ear all night, and that weekend was surprisingly so peaceful for me! Even with coffee and eating whatever I wanted. 

I started piecing things together and now I’m here. I’m obviously going to continue not listening to podcasts tonight and going forward, but I wanted to bring this to y’all in case anyone here has had similar issues and can echo my experience in any way. I am feeling really dumb for having reflected on all the things I could’ve changed about myself the last year that could’ve been causing this, and not realizing it was the damn thing I’ve been doing as I lay down to sleep every night this whole time. I am so sorry for the novel I wrote, but I thought providing all the context might help. Thank you so much in advance!",1,1757641928.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

We want to share an honest update from the heart. When we first announced this project, our team was beyond thrilled to bring Black Bean Deli to the Winter Garden community. From the very beginning, our goal has been to preserve the history of this beautiful 100+ year old building while creating a restaurant space worthy of the community we’re joining. As with any historic building project, the journey has come with unique challenges. Over the past year, construction adjustments and shifting timelines have taken longer than any project we’ve ever been part of. While we’ve been ready and eager to move forward, we’re still awaiting the final handoff of the building before we can begin creating the space we’ve envisioned for you. What hasn’t changed is our commitment. The City of Winter Garden has been incredibly supportive, and our determination to be here has only grown stronger. We remain focused on bringing the same food, coffee, and hospitality that have shaped our Orlando and Winter Park locations. Black Bean Deli was built on resilience — a value passed down from our Cuban grandparents who taught us that failure is not an option. That spirit keeps us pushing forward, no matter how long it takes. While we don’t have an opening date just yet, we promise to share updates as soon as we’re able to move ahead. Until then, thank you for your patience, your encouragement, and your belief in what we do. We cannot wait to finally share our food and our story with you in Winter Garden.

1neqtzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1neqtzv/foolish_old_ladyor_not/,Foolish Old Lady...or Not?,"I've been dedicated to taking decent care of my teeth during my adult life. Nevertheless, I have some tooth & gum issues that need attention. I'm thinking that almost anyone my age (62) has similar issues, more or less. I have one molar that has a very deep filling, and at this point it needs a crown (there's pain, especially with cold water or food). So I'm ready to take care of that. My question, however, is about...looking nice, frankly. About 20 years ago while bicycling my front tire hit oil on the street. I flipped and landed face-down on the street. I was incredibly lucky; only one front tooth broke off and the front tooth next to it chipped just a tiny bit at the corner. I had a veneer put on the broken tooth, but the chip on the other tooth was minuscule. I thought, at the time, that it looked kinda quirky and my dad had the same chip from early in his life. I liked ""matching my dad."" I told the dentist not to bother with the tiny chip.

Over the many years the chip, unfortunately, chipped off more. In addition, the chipped tooth is yellowed (could be from a lot of coffee drinking, is at least partly from the trauma of the chipping). I love to smile at people, but at this point I feel self-conscious about my smile. I hate not smiling!

I just became the patient of a new dentist. She wants me to do a bunch of work before she even discusses repairing the chipped tooth or anything else cosmetic (a bit of whitening, for example). I do have dental insurance, but the amount of money it will take to do a couple of crowns (possibly a root canal) and fill some little cavities will set me back for a solid couple of years. I would like to do the work on the painful molar that needs a crown (maybe a root canal, hopefully not), then go right to repairing the chipped tooth. But my new dentist just blew that off.

When I found out about all the cost involved I see that she's going to make A LOT of money from the other stuff, but not all that much from the front-tooth-repair-chip work. Upon learning that I kinda wondered.

What is the best path? Should I see a different dentist, one who takes my desire to have nice front teeth more seriously? Or am I being foolish?

Please help me understand how I’m messing this up.,"Sorry for ranting and rambling, just frustrated. This was very cathartic to write though, really helped calm the soul. 


Every year, my parents take my siblings (brother 47M and brother 45M), SIL’s (47F and 45F) and I(33M)on a vacation. This year it was a beach house in The Keys. For the first time, I brought someone on the vacation with me, I brought my gf Maggie (29F). We’ve been dating a little more than 2 years and I love her. We’ve had a few arguments before over my SIL’s and mom making decisions for me, and me not being as financially independent as she wants. It’s been just occasionally, but she really dislikes that I don’t control my finances and we’ve fought a few times about it.


Background: this is probably important to mention because it adds context. As you can probably tell, I was a “oh shit, THAT can still happen‽!” baby (my mom was 44 years old.) My brothers both married their highschool sweethearts, so my SIL’s have been VERY involved in my life since I was baby. I was basically raised “hot potato” style, I had a bedroom at both my brother’s houses, and I loved it because it felt like I was having a sleepover every night. They were all busy with work, so I had an au pair that would be in contact with them and I’d go to whoever would be home earliest and that’s where I went for the night. But this and my parents being older and neither of my brothers having kids led to me being a little sheltered and spoiled. Which has led to the arguments with gf about them (mom, and SIL’s) making unilateral decisions for me, overstepping and me not being financially independent. Which I admit they do sometimes, but I think it’s because they care about me a lot and they usually make good decisions and they know a shit ton of stuff that I don’t. And they’re really intimidating when they’re mad and a lot smarter than me, and they’re all corporate lawyers who would never lose an argument to me, so I usually just go with things lol you would too if you met them. Like they told me I should be a teacher because I’m good with kids and would have summers off to golf (hyperfixation that never went away). I never would’ve thought of that but I do love it and it’s where I met my gf Maggie. 

So, this whole trip has been… stressful to say the least. We got to the beach house last, and all the bedrooms on the main level were taken, so we got a bedroom upstairs with a cool deck and a gorgeous view. Gf wasn’t happy about not getting a room choice. 

The second day, woke up and was talking to gf about what we wanted to that day while making coffee. My SIL told me, gf and I were going on a dinner cruise tonight, just the two of us. 

Even though she admitted she wanted to go, gf says that I shouldn’t let them plan my vacation days. But I wouldn’t have thought about going on a dinner cruise date because I’m not a 50yo woman, and i think it was obviously a gift for my gf anyways because she did really want to go, so what’s the problem? 

Then we went shopping and bought really over top beach leisure outfits and those stupid necklaces with your name it to wear one day because why not lol and she got mad after because I used a credit card. Went to the cruise, had fun, got mad because it was already paid for. 

The next day, wake up, are told boys (dad brothers and I) are flying to Jacksonville to play at my favorite golf course (fuck yes, it was so sick) and the girls are shopping and going to a fancy restaurant and then hanging out drinking margaritas. Again, gf likes the plans because she does want to get closer with my family, doesn’t like that I didn’t make them. 

So last night, I tell my SIL to text me the plans so it would look like i made them. I then texted them to the family this morning like I was running the show today, which she thought was funniest thing ever, and i worlds smartest man to think of this loophole. This was the wrong way to take initiative. I’m just so lost. Why does who makes the plans matter if they are good plans? I suck at planning things so why would anyone want me to be the one in charge of that? They are all old, I’m not going to be bossing around a bunch of old people. 

So I apologized for being a dick with the text and say we can do what ever she wants, so we hang out on the beach all day just reading and chilling. It was nice. 

But then, when we get back, my SIL’s had been drinking wine and they were planning to redecorate my condo in Minnesota(my SIL moved there when I was in college to be close to her parents, I would visit them in summer all the time growing up so I got a condo there as a graduation gift from her parents) because it was too bachelor pad’y not family cozy, no idea, but cool, don’t really care. Well, apparently I should care, I’m the one who’s supposed to decide which lamp, that I’ll never think about ever again after buying, is supposed to go in the guest room of a house I spend only a month at maybe in a year. And that I’m immature for letting them do it. I don’t even want a lamp. Who cares about a stupid lamp? Fuck the lamp. 

I just feel like I can’t do anything right and I’m frustrated because why does it matter if they plan things that everyone wants to do and do a whole bunch of stuff for me that I don’t want to do to begin with? Like if they want to do something and I don’t want to do something, doesn’t it just make the sense to have them do that thing? It’s not that I’m incapable of doing it, I’d just rather not. Like the example decorating my condo, I have such little interest in doing that, it’s insane. They like doing that. Doesn’t it just make sense to have them do the thing they want to do? Turn them down and declare independence; that doesn’t make any sense. Things are always good for us until money or my family comes up and I don’t know what I’m supposed do. I really want to make this work because I love her a lot, it’s just this week has been hell. 

(Also tomorrow, girls spa day, guys fishing. Another rad day, who would’ve thought. Carol 3for3, absolutely on fire this week!)

He has lied to me, he has screamed at me because I didn’t wanted to hang with him one time, he’s blamed me for being in the hospital, he has a mother who’s a narcissist so he grew in that environment he has PTSD. He told me he’s afraid of abandoning he emotionally depended on me his therapist told me that. He has forced me to eat food that I do not like & threatened to not get any food at all. When he was angry he got my hand hard that it turned red only cause it was 8 am & I didn’t wanted to go to the gym that day. So yea, I was a little bit abused. He said if I dumped him he’d s**ed. So it was a miracle that I’m kinda ok. It has been hard on me even though I’m the one that broke up I do not hate my ex even though I should for what he’s done, I will admit I’m afraid of him but we’re not talking about that. 

There’s this guy online on Snapchat. I met him before my ex & after having my ex the 1st year I stopped talking to him as much. 

His name is Cris M24 I met him online not in person ever! Now that I broke up with my ex. I miss Not my ex but boyfriend time the kisses, cuddles, him paying for me on dates, me cooking for him, intimacy, sudden flowers, adventures , basically the good moments bf material vibe. 

Cris is a bartender who does not have any education so I know I will not be with him for a long-term nor am I willing to have s*x with him. We’re meeting & hanging 1st time no date I made it clear.I feel an adrenaline excited because  I’m going to get attention, but I do not know what to do. Every time he texted I get excited & then feel down when he takes 4ever to respond but you’ll know why. Or at least my assumption

A part of me analyzes that it’s not worth it after I meet him. He’s going to want more and I do not want More. I told him also in the phone texting that  I’m looking for a long-term, not a short term and he respects it. 

We’re meeting as friends for the 1st time in person after texting for 4 years online. Before you judge, we only texted happy bday merry Christmas. How’s it going with your fiancé ? a.k.a. my ex-boyfriend so just friendly text. 
Nothing on the top. I promise . 

I told him we can meet in a coffee shop & maybe go to the gym That’s casual & friendly no date vibe. I’m really happy when he text me because of the attention, but after I told him, I do not want a short-term. I feel like he’s not texting me as much and he says it’s his work and that he’s busy. 

I have a feeling he might throw a towel and say he’s busy that day we’re hanging in 9 days. I know why I’m doing it and that’s the worst part aka attention & missing bf vibe & some affection BUT I WILL NOT KISS HIM OR ANYTHING. 

Any advice to get rid of the final stage of grief with my ex I miss the bf vibe. I don’t wanna use this guy as bf vibe he seems more as a player!

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Gothlir, Expeditionary fleet Tech Specialist

**Date:** \[Standardized Human Time\]: January 27, 2158

As exciting as the early morning events had been, by about 4am ship time even the coffee wasn't going to keep me going. I headed back to my room, yawning as I thought about what new discoveries tomorrow might bring. Zotta had stayed behind in the lab, too pumped on coffee and science to bother with a petty thing like sleep. Vakks and Leo had departed to get some sleep as well.

I was almost to my room, passing by Mok'lil's quarters. I stopped for a moment, wishing I could check and see if she was ok. Of course the safety protocols on the AI would only open the door for the room's occupant or someone with Officer Monahan's clearance. Still I paused for a moment, listening. I could just make out the sound of slow, rhythmic breathing on the other side. Satisfied she was ok I walked across the hall to my room.

The door slid open automatically for me and I drug my exhausted tail inside. I plopped down on the mattress, reaching over into the metal drawer on my nightstand and pulling out the bottle of Psauma Juice. Nothing like it to knock you out quick and make you sleep like the dead. I opened the bottle and brought it towards my lips. I paused a moment and sniffed the bottle, recalling a rather unpleasant memory of a certain Human/Venlil duo managing to sneak into my room and pour a bunch of that Venlil liquor into the bottle instead. After a quick sniff confirmed it was safe to drink I took a swig and laid down.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I'm not sure how much sleep I managed to get but by the way my body felt it wasn't much. The lights automatically turned on as the AI realized I was awake. I looked around, pondering for a moment what had woken me up? A series of sharp, frantic knocks at my room door quickly answered that.

""What is it?"" I groaned, pulling myself up and rubbing the sleep out of my eye with the back of one paw.

""We got the results of the second genome sequencing!"" Came Zotta's excited (and clearly still quite wound up) voice, ""And the computer has finished piecing together the data on that storage device!"" That second part jolted me awake quick enough.

""Give me a minute to shower and I'll be right down!"" I shouted back, rushing into my bathroom and into the shower. The space was a bit cramped but it worked well enough. I was in and out within five minutes, rushing over to the fur dryer on the wall to blast my pelt with hot air. I wasn't quite patient enough to let it fully do its job though and I could still feel some damp spots on my fur as I hurried out into the hallway. The Dossur was nowhere to be found, presumably already down in the bio lab.

I made my way down as fast as I could. It was times like these I wished I'd been born with the long running legs of a human instead of the stumpy Gojid ones evolution had seen fit to provide. As I passed by Leo's quarters I could see him peek his head out and look around, checking to see if anyone was out there. I could venture a guess as to why. His shoulder-length black hair was a mess and he'd clearly just woken up from what little sleep he had gotten, his eyes puffy slits just barely open.

""Get a shower and then get the captain up!"" I said as I passed by, ""The computer's just finished decoding the data storage device we found."" The human nearly jumped out of his skin as I greeted him, keeping his door half open as he looked down at me.

""Oh damn! Got it!"" He told me before hurriedly ducking back into his room. I couldn't help but roll my eyes.

""Idiot looks like a Venlil with that wild mane of head fluff."" I mumbled humorously to myself as I rushed the rest of the way down to the bio lab. My real destination was the materials lab but I was interested to see what the second genome sequencing had found. ""So what's the verdict Zot?"" The Dossur, whom had been leaping between two different sections of the table whilst fiddling with her holopad looked up.

""I can definitively say the smaller creatures aren't children."" She answered me with a chipper tail swish, ""Stars they aren't even the same species."" She expounded.

""Really?"" I replied, rather shocked. The small, molluskoid creatures and the larger, tree-like entities we had found certainly had looked different but their outer shell composition, the weird musculature… everything had made me think there had to be some sort of connection.  ""So what are they? Pet animals like the Humans are so fond of?""

""Doubtful."" Zotta answered, flicking her ears hesitantly before continuing, ""The two species are definitely connected. The smaller creature's chromosome count was only about 90 pairs. Still a lot but way more in line with what we're familiar with. That and they lack the strange, artificial looking telomere strands on the end.""

""What makes you say they're related?"" I pressed, ""Were there similarities?""

""Those 90 pairs were identical to the first 90 pairs in the tree creature's gigantic genome."" The Dossur explained with a shake of her tail, ""I don't know how to explain it. It's like someone took the whole genetic code of the smaller creatures and just kept building on it and building on it until it became the monstrosity we got from the other creatures."" I pondered that for a minute. There was an old Terran idiom Earl used to throw out… what was it…. Oh! Which came first? The chicken or the egg? Had the creatures with the smaller genetic codes built the bizarre creatures with massive ones or had the creatures with unimaginably huge genomes engineered the smaller ones from theirs? I thought on this while silently wondering what the stars a chicken was?

""What about the sample you took from the ship itself?"" I asked, suddenly recalling the third sample.

""I've already added it."" She replied, her pitch black eyes turning back towards the genome sequencer, ""Honestly that sample has already made me even more confused."" She squeaked, ""When I first added it I got an error from the sequencer because it thought I hadn't sanitized the sample slot. That means the ship HAS to contain the 90 chromosome pairs we found in the last two samples.""

""So what are you saying?"" I pressed, my slowly waking mind already catching the gist of her story, ""That whoever these people were they based their weird, creepy, flesh-tech on their own genetic code?""

The Dossur swished her tail about nervously at that particular suggestion. It seemed that every discovery she made about the mysterious new species put old worries to rest while raising two more in its place. At that moment two new figures wondered into the lab, Vakks and Mok'lil. The Krokotl looked a pretty weary, the way she seemed to hold a wing to her head being a clear sign she was still a bit hung over. The Skalgan beside her looked like she had rushed here right after waking up, the gray wool on the side of her head matted in an upward direction, showing she had slept on it all night. I could just see a small silver chain hanging around her neck, looking very much like the ""necklaces"" I'd seen humans wear. There appeared to be something attached at the bottom of it but whatever it may have been was lost in the thick wool around her chest.

The excitable Dossur was quick to fill them in on her discoveries without being prompted. The other pair listened intently although I could tell that most of it flew right over poor Vakks's head. She was a smart girl but if the subject was outside starship engineering she was sadly at a bit of a loss.

""Y…you know…"" Mok'lil spoke up, looking back towards the entrance before she continued, ""It's n… nice to have a moment away from the humans."" I tensed up, already knowing this wasn't going to end well. I could see Vakks tense up as well, her gaze shooting daggers down at the Krokotl, ""I…. I'm a very tolerant p… person."" Mok'lil continued, seemingly adding that part more to make herself feel better for whatever came after than to actually convince anyone, ""B… but I can't help but feel a b… bit awkward around them. I… I'm just glad they had the civ..civility to refrain from eating m… m… meat in front of us! I know it c… can't be easy for them!"" I let out an exhausted sigh. I swear sometimes she seemed to forget that I was uncured myself and had on more than one occasion helped myself to some of the jerky that our primate crewmembers kept stashed away.

Before I could try and interject Vakks swung a fist straight into the avian's beak, sending her crashing to the floor. Our terrified Dossur friend quickly jumped onto my shoulder, noticeably shaking in fear as she looked on at the unexpected assault. Vakk's slit nostrils were flaring as she glared down at the floored Krokotl, both her paws clenched into tight fists. Somehow her enraged figure seemed more imposing than anything I'd seen from our supposedly ""predatory"" crewmates.

""Y…. you hit me!"" The stunned physicist gasped, bringing a wing up to her beak where the Skalgan had struck her.

""Fucking right I did!"" She hissed down at the cowering woman, ""And if I ever hear you say that drahk again that punch is going to feel like a stars damned hug!"" The Venlil was more incensed than I had ever seen her, her chest heaving as she seemed to be barely containing her rage.

""W… why?"" Was all that Mok'lil could manage to sputter out, still in shock.

""When we were kids,"" Vakks growled, bringing her hand up threateningly, ""Leo stopped eating meat because of people like you! He was so ashamed of it he just stopped. Idiots like you told him it was something awful and he was so desperate to fit in he just stopped. You know what happens if Terrans don't eat meat? They get sick you feather brained bitch! I watched him get weaker and weaker until we had to take him to the hospital!"" She explained, her voice steadily rising as the rage that had been just below the surface steadily bubbled up. I could see tears starting to trickle down her cheek now, making her gray cheek fur almost black, ""The sweetest, most kind hearted person I've ever known almost killed himself to make fed-brained assholes like you feel safe around him!"" I looked on, uncertain what to do as the Skalgan shook visibly, trying to hold back her rage-filled tears. I considered stepping in but in her current state I wasn't entirely sure the Venlil wouldn't throw her fists at anyone who got near!

""I thought humans could choose not to eat meat?"" Zotta whispered in my ear, still shaking, ""I've never seen Leo eat it and he doesn't seem sick.""

""They can if they have supplements."" I whispered back, knowing at least partially what Vakks was referring to, ""But the way I understand it Leo's parents were dead by that time and he was staying with Vakks's family. They had no idea about humans needing supplements to quit meat.""

""I… I…"" The Krokotl stammered, looking like she might cry herself at that.

""I don't know why he keeps defending you."" Vakks continued, clearly not finished laying into the physicist yet. She reached up, wiping some tears from her eyes before going on, ""I've heard you say awful things about him and all humans. I've heard you call them corpse eaters. I've heard you say how 'admirable it is they can control themselves' like you think they're just one step away from attacking you. And the worst part? The worst part is you play this whole bit like you're being a tolerant and understanding person! You say you don't hate humans or think less of them! Well let me tell you, tolerating someone and accepting them are two totally different things! Leo keeps sticking up for you and saying he thinks you're a good person underneath! He may be a fucking idealistic shithead but I'm not! I'm tired of hearing you talk like that towards him one minute and then get drunk the next and start fucking FLIRTING with him!""

I winced at that one. I had thought we had agreed as a crew to sort of sweep that whole incident under the rug. Nobody had felt comfortable that night and the poor woman had been absolutely horrified to hear about her own behavior the next day when we had confronted her about it. Mok'lil's beak was agape in shock, perhaps stunned at the sheer torrent of anger the Venlil had kept buried inside.

""I kept my mouth shut because he asked me to."" Vakks finished, ""But I can't do it any more. You might think that he's some monster just because he has to eat flesh to survive but I know better! He's a wonderful person and I'd gladly watch him eat a whole mountain of flesh if it just meant he was safe and happy!"" As she finished I could tell the girl was just barely holding herself together, her voice cracking as she held back a sob.

""I'm sorry."" Mok'lil finally spoke, hanging her head in a look of shame, ""I… I don't think he's a m…. monster. Y… you're right. I really do li… like him. He's a good kid. You BOTH are. I su… su… suppose I have m… more prejudices to w…. work through than I th… thought."" I could see the poor old girl starting to tear up on the floor, unable to look the indignant Skalgan in the eye. As an uncomfortable silence began to settle down on us the door to the lab opened.

""What the hell is going on in here?!?!"" Came Captain Reynold's voice as she came into the room with our two other human crewmates. ""Vakks! Dr. Mok'lil! What''s the meaning of this?!?!""

""Just a heart to hear among crewmates"" Mok'lil replied as she put a wing on the counter and pulled herself back to her feet, ""Nothing to be alarmed about captain."" She chirped, shooting a glance at a stunned looking Vakks. The Skalgan turned to face the captain, as well as a stunned looking Leo. Her body had finally stopped tensing up and a look of awkward embarrassment quickly took the place of the blazing anger that had been there only moments before.

""As she said ma'am."" The Venlil agreed, finally regaining her composure, reaching an arm up to wipe away the last of her tears. Leo rushed over, looking at the Venlil with concern but not pressing her any further. He just stood beside her, putting an arm on her shoulder as she wrapped her tail around his waist.

""Are you ok?"" Leo finally whispered, just barely audible from where I stood.

""Yeah. Everything's fine Peter Pan."" She whispered back, curling her lips up in an unnerving mimicry of a human smile. I had no idea what ""Peter Pan"" meant and the translator offered no clues.

""You sure?"" He pressed a bit, looking over at where Mok'lil stood, rubbing her assumedly sore beak with her wing.

""Talk shit. Get hit."" Was all that Vakks said in reply, a statement that Leo seemed to know better than to ask her to elaborate on.

Those two could definitely get on my nerves with their pranks but they certainly were a rather empathic duo. Captain Reynolds let out an exasperate sigh before making her way over to us.

""Anything to report?"" The Terran office inquired I Couldn't help but admire her. Even in the most outlandish of situations she seemed to keep her composure. She was the very model of a dignified, UN officer. Sometimes I wondered why she picked an assignment like this. An officer of her caliber could have had her pick of assignments. Instead she was stuck babysitting a rambunctious crew of researchers through the back end of no-where space.

Our predictably oblivious Dossur crewmate took the initiative though and began eagerly expounding on the findings from the sequencer and even a few tentative theories she had about the relationship between the various samples we had taken, her previous fear seemingly forgotten. She was quite the little science buff, like most of my crewmates, and relished the chance to spill her expertise onto someone. I could tell that Reynolds understood every third word though. The captain nodded as the energetic Dossur scientist finished, seeming to contemplate what she had been told for a moment before turning to me.

""So I'm told the shipboard AI finished decoding the data storage device you found?"" She asked, a hint of a smile playing around those lips. I was perfectly aware she was more than eager to move the conversation towards something she might be better equipped to understand.

""It sure did!"" I replied, ""If you guys want to follow me down to the materials lab we can see what it found!"" I said excitedly, hoping to pull them in both from my scientific curiosity and also to get everyone out of the bio lab. I felt awkward just standing there where Vakks and Mok'lil had gone through their little scuffle.

As the crew began to head back towards the hallway however, I put a hand on Mok'lil's shoulder.

""You ok?"" I asked, wanting to make sure she didn't need to make a quick trip to the medical bay.

""I'm fine."" She replied sheepishly, ""M… my pride is bruised m… more than anything."" The avian answered with a sigh before pulling away and making to join the rest of the crew. I could already see Officer Monahan and Trilf waiting patiently out in the hall. It seemed that everyone was interested in seeing just what the data device had waiting for us.

As we eagerly herded out of the room I could see Vakks next to Leo, her tail curled around his wrist as Mok'lil followed behind, her beak held toward the floor in a show of regret. I made a silent note to talk to her more later. The avian was clearly regretful of what she had said. I didn't think Mok was a bad person. Maybe a person with some deep grained prejudices yeah. But she was trying, which was a quill more than I could say for a lot o SC races.

When we finally entered the materials lab I was more than a little excited to show off what we had found from the strange cube. The alien deice had been absolutely loaded with data. Most standard storage devices among coalition members could hold something like a petabyte or so of information. This cube? It held easily 30 times that; although it wasn't nearly filled up. Even now I was marveling at the tech these strange xenos had pulled off to manage this. The inside of the unusual cube was assembled almost like a brain, if every neuron was condensed a thousand fold.

""So what have we got?"" Captain Reynolds asked, looking at the admittedly strange amalgamation of wires I had been forced to rig to the cube in order to get it to interface with our ship's onboard systems.

""Well,"" I tried to explain with my limited knowledge, ""From what I can tell the cube is an enlarged version of what we do with memory transcriptions for the most part. I haven't had a chance to look over the whole data feed since it was so massive but from what I saw on the computer before I went to bed last night it was clearly the same sort of information layout we get when looking at a memory transcript.""

""Do you think it's a memory transcript of the alien we found in the ship? The one who managed to come back from the dead for just long enough to hand it to us?""

""Speaking of that."" Doc interrupted, waddling his way towards the front of the group, ""I was looking over the medical scans I took from the creature. I don't think it was dead per say. It's whole body had been biologically integrated with the ship itself. I would venture a guess that it was using the ship's systems to keep itself in a sort of long-term hibernation. Perhaps in the hope that another of its kind might eventually find it and be able to render medical assistance."" I couldn't help but agree given the information. Putting themselves in a sort of stasis in the hopes of being rescued certainly seemed like the most reasonable assumption.

I pulled up my holopad, linking it up to the computer in the materials lab and giving a quick look at the remainder of the data stream that had been pulled from the strange cube. It was definitely a memory transcript. I'd seen enough of them before to recognize that much instantly. But there was something else in there too. A pair of secondary sections of information, compartmentalized from the majority of it. I opened the larger of the two and gave the AI the instruction to analyze it. To my surprise the computer immediately flagged it as translator programming.

""What in the Protector's name…"" I muttered out loud.

""Perhaps you wouldn't mind sharing with the rest of the class?"" Captain Reynolds sighed, cocking one of those thin ridges of hair humans had above their eyes.

""Uh… It's translator data."" I managed to sputter out, struggling to think how I should describe what I was seeing. ""A lot of translator data. I have readouts for every single species in the database. Plus like…. A few THOUSAND It doesn't recognize.""

""Translator data?"" Reynolds replied uncertainly, ""Why would that be included with a memory transcript?""

""Because whoever made the transcript wanted to be certain that whoever found it would be able to understand it."" Leo marveled, ""Although it's a little terrifying to think that whoever these people were had knowledge of every single federation species.""The Terran paused, looking towards e hesitantly. Hey. Gothlir?"" He added, ""Are human languages in there?""

""Oh yeah."" I replied, ""Lots of human languages from the look of it.""

""You said there were thousands of other entries?"" Zotta piped in, unexpectedly rushing up onto a nearby counter to get a good look at my holopad.

""Also yes."" I continued, ""I don't recognize any of these. Krev? Harconni? Velidu?"" I sighed, listing off the names of the separate entries (Or at least what the computer's translation software interpreted them to be.

""What's that second data partition?"" Leo asked, making me jump slightly. The younger Terran had silently made his way behind me so that he could join Zotta in peering over my shoulder at the holopad and I hadn't expected to hear his voice coming from behind me.

""Not sure."" I muttered, closing the partition with the translator data and flicking open the partition in question. Almost instantly it seemed to open some command that had been waiting inside and a quick stream of binary flashed across the holopad's display. ""Uh oh."" I groaned, desperately trying to close it out only for my holopad to completely cease responding.

""Uh oh?"" Reynolds repeated, jumping into action to rush around the tangled mass of wires connected to the cube and over to where I stood, ""I don't like uh oh."" The rush of code finally vanished, leaving me at a loss. I quickly opened the logs from the ship's computers, trying to determine exactly what that line of code had done. To my growing dismay I found the first thing that the strange code had done. It had wiped all of the activity logs.

""This could be bad."" I sighed, ""I'm going to need to run a complete systems check to make sure whatever that payload they had waiting for us in there did doesn't mess up any of the ship's systems.

""I doubt it did."" Leo mused, sounding insanely calm given current circumstances.

""And what makes you so sure of that?"" Monahan piped in, giving Leo that strange eye gesture that Reynolds had given to me earlier.

""One: That creature's dying words were, assuming all of our translators weren't having an off day, pretty clearly benevolent. Two: Whoever made this seems to have gone to some pretty extreme lengths to make sure it was understandable to whoever they thought might find this. If you were going to do something malicious I don't think you'd want whoever might go back and look through it to be able to possibly figure out what you were doing.""

""Fair reasoning."" Reynolds replied, running a hand through her short, gray head fur, ""But I'm not the kind to take chances. Gothlir? Any chance you could look at the code that just opened and figure out what it did?""

""Oh!"" I gasped, ""I didn't even think of that! If I open the partition in an isolated environment I can manually trace it and see exactly what it did!"" I answered excitedly, hurrying back down to my holopad and getting to work.

""I'm going to assume that means yes."" Captain Reynolds responded with a rather dry sounding chuckle. My claws clicked away on the pad as quickly as I could, eagerly loading up that mysterious file. I fully expected this work to take me quite some time since I would be doing it manually, unable to risk the ship's AI accidentally triggering it again. However, to my great astonishment I found that the line of code was remarkably basic in its function.

""Well that was easier than I expected."" I muttered with a sense of uncertainty. It couldn't have been THAT simple could it? ""All it seems like this code would do would be to temporarily take over administrator privileges on whatever it was activated on and copy the larger section over to the new device? I mean… yeah there's a little bit here after that instructing it to wipe any logs but otherwise that seems to be it?"" I phrased it as a question since I honestly felt uncertain about what I was seeing myself. I couldn't imagine what purpose that could have. Maybe it was just a built-in backup feature? But why go through the trouble of wiping all the logs and hiding exactly where on the new device you copied the data to? That made no sense.  

""Any smart theories on that?"" Reynolds asked in a tone that I would have called playful if I didn't know any better as she turned towards Leo. The younger human squinted his face up as though he was thinking so hard that it was becoming painful.

""You said the data it copied was just translator info and a memory transcript?"" Leo asked slowly, as if speaking the words as they formed in his head.

""Yeah. Pretty much."" I confirmed with a shrug, ""It's an absolutely massive memory transcript but that's definitely what it is.""

""What do you mean by massive?"" Reynolds asked, her eyes narrowing as if some unpleasant thought had just entered her head.

""I mean…."" I stumbled over my words as I tried to answer, struggling to explain what I was seeing on the data pad, ""The transcription is easily the biggest I've ever seen. Waaaaay longer than any other I've ever found. Not saying I've looked at all that many mind you but this seems like the memories of someone that had lived for quite a while. Not to mention they seemed to have taken a lot of time and effort into recording emotional responses and building some sort of… personality profile maybe?""

The captain was silent a moment as she mulled over what I had said, the look of concern only building on her face.

""Back on Earth I'd heard of a company that was attempting to use memory transcriptions as a way to put people's minds into machines."" She spoke at last, ""I don't know a hell of a lot about it except the research was real hush-hush and that the UN was taking a real big interest in it. The one thing I definitely DO remember hearing was that a big part of that effort involved not just moving people's memories over but building a sort of…. replica of their personality. That sounds a hell of a lot like what you're talking about Goth.""

""So… what?"" Vakks chimed in, seemingly confused by what that could be implying, ""Are you saying this memory transcript is some kinda…. Robot brain version of whoever recorded it?""

""Something like that I guess."" The gray haired woman shot back with a shrug, ""Of course I don't know what you would do with that. Maybe they were hoping we'd have the ability to upload them into a new body?""

My eyes went wide as a new possibility entered my mind. What if that was EXACTLY what they had been hoping for? What if they needed something with enough processing power to run the insanely massive program that constituted the memory transcript and personality profile? Something like the ship's computers?!?! I tried to hold back the sense of panic that had started to build inside me at that idea. But where would the ship even have put all that data? The memory transcript was absolutely massive! No single storage drive on the ship could have held it by itself! The thought occurred to me that it may have been able to spread itself out. Over the full length of all the ships drives there was certainly more than enough space to store that information if it was spread out.

""I'm going to start running that systems check."" I choked out, fighting back a growing sense of unease.

**Thivel, Sol Exploration Team**

*May 27th, 2148*

*Carbon.* Silicon’s enigmatic elder. 

For as long as my people have categorized materials into elements, we have known of this one’s strange duality. Older than silicon in stellar birth and richer in its number of possible bondings with other elements, yet far less stable. Where silicon arranges itself into ordered chains and lattices that endure for eons, carbon can hold no such form. To miners on Yroc, it is an impurity: clinging to more valuable substances like a parasite. Though prized by engineers for the carbides and diamonds it can be used to create, carbon in its purest form is unstable at best.

Even still, hundreds of years before my people would achieve superluminal travel, a biochemist proposed that this element could in theory be the backbone of life on other worlds. The Carbon Life Hypothesis was popular in its time and even now maintains some fringe proponents. However, when one presents the scientific community with something to sink their mandibles into, they must be prepared to see it torn apart. 

In my basics of astrobiology class, one of our assignments was to review two articles—one written in favor of the Carbon Life Hypothesis and one opposed to it. As it turns out, the closer one gets to the modern day, the more difficult it becomes to find the former. The true death blow for Carbon Life in mainstream astrobiology came from the Rhuvix experiment, where Gifrid crystocytes—our smallest unit of living material—were reconstructed using carbon-based molecules. The first issue was that the cells could not function in anything resembling a reasonable temperature. At room temperature (470°C), they boiled and melted, but in freezing conditions their metabolism was too slow. The greatest issue, however, was how *unstable* they were. Even using exotic metabolism to generate more energy, the cells almost immediately mutated to the point of incoherence with the greater whole. Within days, the crystocyte clusters tore themselves apart with their own unchecked growth. 

“Carbon life?” I chittered quietly, staring down at our readings of the planet as though willing them to start making sense so that I wouldn’t have to consider the bizarre impossibility placed before me. “Surely you jest, Ebsu…”

“You see all these hotspots?” Continued our xenobiologist, their manipulator claws tapping the screen in various locations. “At first I thought they might be volcanic vents, but the spacing is all wrong. They look like… Cities… And the signal traffic matches that hypothesis.”

“That’s not possible…” I coughed, clinging to my education in the face of something that seemed to defy all logic. “Carbon microbes, maybe, but the cancer problem alone would prevent them from developing past that point, not even to mention the metabolic rates in this temperature.”

Gede’s carapace lit up with signals of curiosity mixed with frustration as they turned away from their station to face me directly. “With all due respect, sir, there’s really only one way to say for certain. First contact protocol states that all evidence of advanced civilization must be immediately investigated upon discovery.”

Throughout the bridge, my ensuing silence was taken by the crew as permission to speculate and debate amongst themselves. 

“If there really are intelligent lifeforms down there, think of what the implications could be for the field of biology as a whole!” Ebsu chittered excitedly, their enthusiasm echoed by other crew members. “This could be the most important scientific discovery since faster-than-light travel!”

Our geologist, Rakle, meanwhile, began to pace nervously, their many legs clacking rhythmically against the floor behind me. “I’m not so sure that’s a good idea…” They concluded grimly, their carapace dulled by an unease they were clearly attempting to conceal. “These lifeforms might not be anything like what we know of. Who’s to say how their minds work? We should leave this planet alone for now—make contact once we have a fleet in orbit.”

Behind Rakle, other crew members spoke up in solidarity with the geologist’s assessment. Our first contact procedures were created with *normal* lifeforms in mind. Would the concepts we were supposed to employ even apply here? 

“A fleet? Are you listening to yourself?” Gede chittered incredulously, regarding our geologist as though they had just suggested flying us into a star. “Even if they *were* hostile, we could easily retreat and come back later in force.”

“I’m just saying that once we send the contact signal, there’s no going back.”

Opinions pinged back and forth across the bridge as voices for and against making contact coalesced into two distinct masses, each urging me to make the call in their favor. 

“I believe Rakle is correct,” I finally concluded after a long stretch of debate amongst my crew. “It would be wise of us to consult the Grand Executive before taking action.”

“But Thivel, sir…” Interrupted Ebsu, his manipulator claws clacking together anxiously. “If we waste time returning to Gifrid space without complete data on the system, then they might have to send another survey team before moving to colonize. We’d all be risking our claims to Vulca—and that’s assuming that the Yovi or Funac don’t snatch it up first!”

The xenobiologist was right, of course. I hated that. Surrendering a claim to such a beautiful planet as Vulca would be foolish. In the mere hours since our discovery of the paradise planet, I’d already grown rather attached to the notion of becoming a colony lord—living lavishly and wielding the respect seldom given to the captains of survey vessels. Even still, as I looked upon the readings on our screens that sang of life, a feeling of deep unease swirled within me. 

Suddenly, Rakle’s side had gone quiet, leaving behind only the voices of assent. None of them wanted to give up their rightful claims to Vulca. If I as their captain made a decision resulting in such a monumental loss, then they would never allow me to live it down…

“Fine…” I coughed, silicate dust exiting my mouth before quickly disappearing into the ship’s ventilation. “We will send a contact signal—the bare minimum required. If nobody responds, we chalk this up to a geological phenomenon and mark it for later study. Either way, our claims to Vulca remain intact.”

Nobody spoke up to object as Gede carefully calibrated the contact signal to play on every detected wavelength. If nothing else, I was grateful that whatever might have lived down there had discovered broadcast technology. If they hadn’t, then contact protocol was to suit up and go down ourselves. Then again, if they had remained quiet, then we wouldn’t have had to contact them in the first place.

The contact signal itself was a simple, elegant thing. A sequence of prime numbers between one and eighty-one, followed by a hydrogen line frequency of 1420 megahertz for nine seconds. After that, the signal repeats. Not only was a prime number sequence unheard of in the realm of natural radio phenomena, but any civilization with radios would easily be able to recognize it.

With the signal broadcasting on every channel, all that was left was to wait…

Seconds crawled by at the pace of hours as the crew waited in near-total silence. When fifteen minutes passed with no response, Rakle visibly relaxed along with much of the other crew. Ebsu, meanwhile, appeared disheartened, his carapace glowing cold. 

After another half hour, the relief was beginning to flow over me like a calming bath of molten lead. *I was right*, I thought. There was nothing alive down there—there couldn’t be—and we’d all gotten worked up for nothing. Even still, protocol was to send the signal for at least one hour, so we continued to wait.

Then, at the forty-nine minute mark, we began to receive signals back. Prime numbers between eighty-two and one hundred and sixty two, followed by a helium line frequency—as clean a mandible rub as ever there was.

Amidst the tenuous silence, reactions from my crew bubbled to the surface like air pockets in magma, starting with quiet, scattered hisses before slowly intensifying to the point of pandemonium. Carapaces lit up in dizzying spectrums of color—confusion, fear, excitement. “I can’t believe it…” Ebsu chittered joyously, their mandibles clicking together in a gesture of intense want. “There really is civilization down there!”

“Or something like it…” Rakle added ominously, having abandoned their station to position themselves directly behind me. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Captain, because whoever’s down there, they know we’re here now.”

————————-

**Johan Edgar, American NSA Director** 

*May 27th, 2148*

I was on my way to work when the signal first came on over my car’s radio. A string of sharp, metallic beeps drowned out the repetitive drawl of some radio show that had been on when I turned the key. The broadcast was deliberate, patterned, but nothing like Morse or any other code I knew of. At first, I thought the station was getting jammed by something, so I reached for my car’s radio knob and turned to another frequency, only to be faced with the same inexplicable noise. Then I realized it wasn’t just my radio. In the next lane over, a tubby trucker was leaning over his dashboard, staring at it like it had come alive. Every station, every channel blared that same relentless pulse.

Less than two minutes later, my phone buzzed in my pocket—no caller ID, but I still knew exactly who it was. Taking a sip of the coffee I’d bought ten minutes prior at a donut shop drive-through, I fished the phone out of my jeans and answered the call. “Mr. President…”

Traffic got bad not long after the signal came on. It was like every warm body in America suddenly realized it had somewhere better to be. My thirty-minute commute had doubled into an hour, every ten minutes or so punctuated by another call ceding me information whilst simultaneously demanding to know what the hell was happening as if I had a clue.

It had been a cool summer morning, but I was already sweating by the time I finally arrived at the office. Adjusting my tie as I rushed past security and made my way into the briefing room, I arrived just in time to hear my second in command, Evan, chewing out the director of SETI. “Your people had absolutely zero authority to send that signal!” He shouted, the rage in this voice sufficient to make everyone in the office not named Johan shrivel into themselves. “The NSA director just got here, but I’m not done with you, understand?” There was a muffled voice on the other end right before Evan disconnected the call.

“What do we know?” I demanded, peering around the room as I waited for someone to fill in the blanks.

Evan, of course, was first to speak up. “Approximately seventy minutes ago, a signal started broadcasting over every radio station in America—ones from Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii included. It’s a bunch of prime numbers followed by a hydrogen line frequency.”

“Think the signal might be Russian?” I asked, running the possibilities through my mind at speeds so fast I could barely wrap my head around a thought before it was replaced by the next. 

Across the table, Agent Miller shook her head. “I just got off the phone with the Kremlin’s men. They wanted to know if it was us.”

“It’s not Chinese either,” added Agent Adams, eliminating my next best guess before I even had the opportunity to make it.

“Whatever it is, it’s already all over social media,” interjected Evan, pulling up a seemingly-endless stream of clips and text plucked from every major platform on the planet.

Returning my attention to Evan, I gestured with my pointer finger toward the phone he’d hung up not long before. “Call back Director Lenfield. SETI has some of the best radio receivers in the world, and we need the data that’s on them.”

Immediately, Evan picked up the phone and tapped on the application to open recent calls, clicking the icon at the top and setting it to speaker mode.

The phone rang once…

Twice…

“Hello?” Director Lenfield’s voice crackled out into the room, sounding out a combination of defeat and exhaustion.

“Lenfield, this is National Security Agency Director Johan Edgar. My associate, Deputy Director Evan Scott, spoke with you already.”

Lenfield didn’t say anything for a second, though in the background I could hear voices that sounded like they were coming from a television. Every news station in America—hell, probably the rest of the world as well—was going on nonstop about the signal. “Do you need anything?” Lenfield asked, sounding distracted.

“What can you tell me about that signal?” I replied, my tone more to the tune of a command than a question.

“We’re triangulating it now,” confided Lenfield before hesitating. “What I can tell you this instant is that it matches up with everything we at SETI have been looking for since our founding.”

Leaning back in my seat in an effort to convince myself this wasn’t the most batshit day of my life, I sighed heavily before taking a sip of my now-cold coffee. “Go on…”

“The prime numbers, the hydrogen frequency… I don’t think this signal is terrestrial in origin.”

“What are you talking about? A satellite?”

“No,” Lenfield replied, the voices of the television suddenly cutting off. “I’m saying that we’ve determined with reasonable certainty that this is an artificial, extraterrestrial signal.”

It took all my willpower not to scream at him. “Let me get this straight…” I growled, leaning in closer to the phone so that my voice would be loud and clear. “You received a signal that you *think* might be extraterrestrial and you fucking responded to it? You didn’t ask the President first, you didn’t ask anyone?”

Again, there was silence. “I didn’t authorize it,” Director Lenfield replied, stone cold in the face of my outburst. “One of my employees composed the signal and was going to wait for approval, but that transmitter hasn’t been used in two decades and it glitched.”

“What are we looking at for the triangulation?” I demanded, staring into the screen with enough intent to hopefully make Lenfield on the other end start sweating as hard as I was.

“If it really is alien, we’re probably looking at a signal from lightyears away,” Lenfield replied.

“What’s that in months?” I sighed, still wrestling with the notion that I’d have to be the one debriefing the President on this.

“Lightyears are a measure of distance, not—” Lenfield began to explain before suddenly cutting off. “That can’t be right…”

“What can’t?” Demanded Evan, echoing the question that was already on the tip of my tongue.

“The signal… It’s coming from a high-earth orbit. I’m adjusting our telescopes to… Oh my god.”

“What?” I shouted.

Lenfield hung up, and six minutes later, we received the data I had demanded from him, along with a single attached image.

It seems most people recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup (5 oz). My Presto is 6 cups (30 oz, ~888 mL).  6 tablespoons seems too weak for me and 8 causes the basket to overflow. 7 tablespoons makes an okay cup of coffee but I feel like it could be better with some dialing in. I’m using a 1Zpresso K ultra and also a Timemore S3. I’ve found around 8-9 on the K ultra and around 7-8 on the S3 produce the best results but they seem to be so inconsistent. One day it’s very good, the next mediocre. I’ve also tried with and without a disc paper filter and don’t really have a preference.

You laugh. You ache. You love. But if every reaction was scripted by someone else, are they still yours?

And if truth itself was only a glitch… would you dare to face it? Or would you keep living inside a perfect loop, and call it life?  
...

I open my eyes. Light spills through the window—not scattered, not harsh. Perfect, like a digital painting without a single flaw. I blink once. Twice. Something stutters between light and time, like a scene rewound and played again. The room waits in stillness, an animated photograph. Only… I can’t remember when I fell asleep.

The morning feels too exact. Too still. The sun lies across the balcony like a cloth laid down by invisible hands. No birds. No cars. Only the hiss of the pan, steady and unbroken—a sound sample repeating. Coffee drifts through the air. Sweet. Strong. Perfect enough to make me wary.

Am I smelling coffee… or a memory triggered on cue? As if someone was watching me, adjusting the script whenever I noticed.

I turn. My wife stands at the stove, her back to me. She stirs eggs slowly, precisely. This morning feels like yesterday’s. Yesterday like the day before. She turns and smiles—gentle, warm—but her eyes hold something else. As if I’ve woken into this morning again and again, and each time… she smiles the same.

My daughter runs in and clings to my legs. *“Daddy! Wake up! It’s Saturday!”* I bend and lift her. She laughs. Her hand touches my cheek, soft and warm—but wrong. As if someone copied the heat of an old embrace and pasted it here.

I breathe in her hair. Clean. Familiar. Too familiar. I know I’ve smelled this countless times… but I can’t recall when. As if the memory has been replayed until the film itself wore thin.

We eat breakfast. She tells me her dream: a horse with wings, a rainbow falling from the ceiling. My wife laughs. *“But why were you riding… a cat the size of a school bus?”* We all laugh. I laugh too. But inside, something slips. Everything feels too right. Too smooth. Like a song without a single wrong note. And that chills me.

I step into the garden. The breeze is light. A leaf breaks free. I follow it. But the leaf does not fall. It rises. No twist. No flutter. As if the world rewound… but forgot its sound.

I freeze, my breath caught, trapped between two frames of time—one playing forward, one overwritten. The leaf touches the branch, then vanishes.

I return inside and take my wife’s hand. She smiles, flawless and unshaken. But her hand is cold. Not the cold of air, but the cold of something without heat. A wax figure, once beloved.

I let go. She doesn’t move. Still smiling. As if she didn’t notice… or didn’t need to. I can’t tell if her hand was always like this, or if I’ve only just begun to see differently.

Everything remains beautiful. Peaceful.

Only sometimes… I feel I am no longer standing where I was meant to be.  
...

I arrive at work. **8:13 a.m.** Exactly the same as yesterday. And the day before. Only… I can’t remember when “yesterday” began.

The receptionist greets me with a practiced smile. The secretary asks, *“Mr. Elias… ginger tea, as always?”* I nod. Everything is smooth. Polite. Clean. Too clean.

Then I notice: no one blinks. Not one. Eyes wide, pupils fixed, no tremor. Like characters in a game, just loaded in.

I sit at my desk. The clock ticks to 8:14. I try to finish yesterday’s report—but there is no yesterday. Not a scrap. Not a line. Not even a trace of feeling. I try to summon a colleague’s face, but only a gray blur rises, as if someone scrubbed my memory clean until nothing remained.

I ask about the meeting. He smiles faintly, shakes his head. *“What meeting? You must be mistaken.”* I nod, force a laugh, but inside, a note strikes wrong. Off-beat. Loud, though unseen. Like a flaw hidden inside a flawless song.

He turns away. Then I hear it: a laugh, soft and distant. His voice. But it plays before his mouth even moves.

After lunch, I step into the archive. Files stacked high. One paper slips free. Wrinkled. Faded. A round logo, blurred into gray. I bend down. Familiar. Too familiar. Not from one dream—from all of them. Not inside memory. Deeper. Etched into the marrow. A symbol never erased, only hidden under a new skin.

That evening at home, my daughter tugs my sleeve. *“Daddy, do you remember the big lake park? When the little duck got lost?”*

I freeze. I don’t remember. Not an image. Not a sound. That memory feels like ink wiped clean from the page. But my chest still tightens. A lone note strikes: wordless, shapeless. Only pain without a name.

*“You don’t remember, Daddy?”* she asks.

I squeeze her hand, as if one more question and the memory itself would vanish forever. I smile. *“Ah… maybe I forgot.”*

She doesn’t answer. Just looks at me. Long. Then turns away.

I stand there, empty. No thought. No memory. As if someone had pulled me out of myself. Inside my head—a hollow room. No paintings. No photographs. No echo.

I no longer live in my own memory. I only stand in the empty spaces where I used to be.

And I realize—someone else has rewritten my past. Not to make me forget, but to make me remember only the way they wanted.  
...

That night, I dream again. A white room. No doors. No sound. No depth. Only me, standing behind a glass wall. And across from me… myself. Another Elias.

He sits with his back turned inside a sterile lab. White light cuts across his shoulder. No shadow. No shift. As if even the light feared breaking script. Three figures in white coats stand before him. Faces blurred, boiled away. No eyes. No mouths. Only voices, cold and familiar: *“…stable…”* *“…experiment…”* *“…good…”*

I strike the glass. No echo. No reply. No one turns. I am trapped, unable to touch anything except myself.

One of them draws a syringe. Slow. Exact. A ritual too practiced to fail. The needle pierces his right arm. Deep. Cold. Precise. Blue veins rise beneath the skin—a map leading straight into the core of memory.

He does not blink. Does not flinch. Eyes wide. Empty. As if the soul had been taken long before. I scream. The sound tears out, dry like ash. No echo. Nothing changes.

Except… he tilts his head. Barely. But his eyes do not meet mine. They look through, as if he knows I’m here and chooses to ignore it. And I feel stripped bare—not through flesh, but through memory. He isn’t looking at me. He is opening me. Drawer by drawer. Layer by layer. I am no longer remembering; I am being opened like an old file. And he is turning pages. Choosing an ending… for me.

I jolt awake. Breath sharp, back soaked in cold sweat, throat raw as if filled with ash. I glance down at my right arm. A small red mark. Not deep. Not swollen. But wrong. Not a wound. An injection. Clean. Too clean. As if it had been there all along, waiting for me to notice.

I touch it. Pain, dull and contained, but real. The ache seeps from deeper inside. My arm lags in its response, not from weariness but as if awaiting a command from elsewhere. And I begin to fear… my own skin.

I tell no one. Not my wife. Not my daughter. Not because I fear their worry, but because I no longer trust those are still their eyes. I repeat inside my head, like a broken prayer: *“It was only a dream. Only a dream.”* As if, if I say it enough, the world might step back.

The next morning, washing my face, a drop of water clings to my hand. It does not slide. It holds still, perfect. As if it was watching me. I turn away—not because I fear seeing, but because I fear being seen. I wipe it off, and never mention it again.

The next night, another dream. No doctors. No machines. Only a figure, back turned, inside the white room. No breath. No movement. But I know that stance. The tilt of the shoulder. The weight shifted left. Exactly me.

As if I stand before a mirror, but this mirror does not reflect.

Then his voice. Not from his mouth. Not from the room. From inside my head. An echo without a throat: *“If you are remembering what I once remembered… then you are not the first to awaken in this world.”*

I freeze. Throat locked. No sound escapes. And the worst is… I begin to wonder.

Have I ever truly awakened? Or am I only a program, finishing its boot sequence?  
...

The next morning I am home alone. Light rain. Droplets cling to the glass. They do not slide. Do not fade. They only stay, as if watching me from the other side. The air is heavy, so dense even the light halts at the curtain. Stillness unnatural. As if the house itself was holding its breath.

I sit in the study, pretend to shuffle papers, pretend to be busy. Each line I glance at feels unwritten, weightless. I am trapped between white dreams and the red mark still burning on my arm.

A gust of wind. The window shivers. Then—the radio clicks on. I didn’t touch it. No timer. No one else home. It just turns on. Static first. Harsh. Distorted. Then—my voice.

Not from the speaker. Not from the next room. From inside my skull. The volume begins at zero, yet I hear it clear, as if something lodged between my ears had powered on with a neural command. A sound borrowing no ears, no speaker. Only… my voice.

*“If you remember… don’t trust what you see. And don’t let them know you’ve begun to remember. Because what remains… will never forgive you.”*

I freeze. Not at the warning. At the fact I don’t recall ever saying it. Like hearing a recording of myself from a world not mine. I no longer trust my ears. Worse… I no longer trust my thoughts. Every reflex. Every line of logic could be nothing but a message spliced in.

My neck prickles. My spine snaps cold. Rigid. I lunge forward, rip the plug, tear the cord, pull the batteries. The radio falls silent. But the voice remains. Not broadcast. Stored. Etched into a layer deeper than language.

I don’t know when I first heard it. Only that it doesn’t need me to listen. It only needs me to exist. And now—I am no longer certain. Which thoughts are mine. Which are commands transmitted from elsewhere.

That evening, I ask my wife. My voice cracked, thin like wind through a fracture: *“Do you remember… where our home used to be?”*

She turns. Smiles. *“We’ve always lived here, Elias. Always here.”* Her voice warm. Comforting. Too perfect. No pause. No slip. As if every syllable was assembled from fragments long pre-recorded.

I do not ask again. I do not dare. Not because I fear the truth. But because I fear the precision of her answer. We eat dinner as usual. I laugh. She laughs. Everything in script. Only tonight… I cannot swallow.  
...

I dream again. But this time deeper. So deep I no longer know if I am the one dreaming, or someone else’s dream of me.

I stand in haze, as if trapped behind a mirror. The mirror reflects nothing. No image. Only me, sealed inside. Beyond the glass—a white lab. Sterile. Cold. Empty. On the bed… another Elias. Still. Breathless. Eyes shut. As if waiting to be woken from a sleep too long.

The door opens. A man enters. White coat. Face blurred, like data stripped of attributes. He carries a bouquet. And a picture frame. He approaches, places the flowers on Elias’s chest. Soft… like an apology too late. Then he adjusts the frame. Careful. Precise. As if he had done it a hundred times before.

I cannot hear. But words fracture in the air, breaking like water: *“…the day they left… today…”*

I press against the glass. The frame sharpens. It is me. My wife. My daughter. Inside a car. I at the wheel. My wife smiling bright beside me. My daughter in the back, lifting a blue hair tie.

I have never seen this photo. Yet I remember. Remember as if my own eyes were staring back from the far side of the world. Then the world overturns. Wheels spin in air. Glass explodes. My daughter’s laughter still ringing—until metal screams across the windshield.

A heartbeat surges. Then stops. Light flickers. Like a failing defibrillator. I grip the wheel. But I am no longer driving. Someone else is steering me. Then—they pull the plug.

No time to scream. No time to call their names. Only a last glimpse: my daughter’s smile dissolving into light.

I scream. Call for my wife. My daughter. Hammer the glass. No echo. No crack. Nothing breaks… except me.

I do not wake. The memory drags me up, like a corpse pulled from the bottom of a lake. My chest convulses, as if unseen hands jolt me alive. Not from dream. From memory. A memory forced to be forgotten.

I jolt upright. Frozen. Breathless. Eyes unblinking. Cold sweat soaking my back. From the living room—TV chatter. My wife laughs softly. My daughter runs around the sofa, the blue hair tie trailing behind her.

Everything correct. Too correct. As if I had woken inside a staged replica of my life. A world with no space left for truth.

I bow my head. Not because I cannot remember. But because I remember too well. And I understand: people don’t erase memories to survive. They erase… to endure.

If I still remember, I cannot remain here. Someone helped me forget. Not to save me. But to bind me inside this story. Because if I remember enough… I will try to leave.

And they… will never allow it.  
...

I sit a long time at the edge of the bed. Outside, rain falls steady. Each drop like a memory dissolving, dripping slow into my chest. The house is the same. But I… am not. There is a crack somewhere. Small. Invisible. And I know it will never heal.

I rise and step into the living room. She is smiling, her eyes soft—exactly as the first day I loved her. Unchanged. Unaged. It is that perfection that tells me everything has been wrong for a very long time.

*“I have to leave.”* The words slip out like the first fracture across glass. Imperfect. Uncertain. But irreversible.

She is not surprised. Only nods. Quiet. *“I know. You will go. And I will still wait.”* Her voice too steady, like a recording played back. No tremor. No pause. No deviation. As if I had scripted this farewell myself, just to live it again one more time.

My daughter runs in, arms around my leg. *“Daddy… can’t you stay with me and Mommy?”* I kneel, hold her close. My chest splinters with every beat. My arms wrap tight, but my palms tremble. Tremble as if I’m holding something that will vanish if I hold too long.

*“I’m sorry… I still have something I must do. If there’s a way back… I’ll return.”* She looks at me, eyes glistening, then places something in my hand. A blue hair tie. Worn. Frayed. On the verge of breaking. Her fingertips cold—too cold. Not the chill of rain, but the cold left when time brushes past.

*“Keep it, Daddy… to remember me.”*

I close my fist around it, clutching the one thing not yet erased. She runs into her room. Does not look back. My wife steps closer, silent. Her arms fold around me, a grip so tight as if she feared I would dissolve if she let go. Her chin rests on my shoulder, her breath touches my neck. So faint, like memory itself whispering back.

I ask, without turning: *“Are you real?”*

She does not answer. Her hand presses to my chest. *“I once asked you the same… but you never answered.”* She holds me, long, as if silence itself could mend the cracks.

I do not turn. But I know what waits if I do. A warm world. A whole memory. A dream that never ends. But the price: I would remain. Forever. And forget it all.

So I walk. Each step tearing threads of soul from my ribs. But I do not stop. The rain still falls. Each drop heavy, weighted with something torn inside. Not violent. Not loud. Just falling. As if the sky itself is learning to forget.

I keep my eyes forward. Because one glance back… and I will dissolve into that rain. As if I never existed.  
...

I leave the old house once filled with laughter, voices, love. Now—only the after-echo of what once was. Rain brushes my shoulders. Not cold. Not sharp. As if I’ve been programmed not to feel anymore.

I don’t know where I’m going. But my feet do. As if they’ve walked this path a thousand times, though memory holds none of them. I stop. A house before me. No name. No light. No time. The door opens—though I never touched it.

Inside—nothing but mirrors. Walls. Ceiling. Floor. Mirrors reflecting mirrors. An endless hall of Elias faces. I step in. Each step dragging thousands of copies. But none in sync. Some stand frozen, heads tilted, as if they once tried to run… and broke. I see myself in them. Weary. Doubtful. Spent. Discarded versions. Errors stripped away.

At the center—he stands. Another Elias. Back turned. Still. I shout, voice cracking like glass: *“Who are you? What have you done to me… to my family?”*

He doesn’t turn. But the mirrors answer. The room itself replies: *“You ask me… or yourself?”*

My fists clench. Veins straining. *“You made me forget. You built this cage of light… and called it freedom. You stole my pain… and named it happiness.”*

Silence. Then his voice again. Slow. Heavy. Like a question that never wanted an answer: *“Do you truly believe… everything here is false?”*

I falter. A part of me wants to believe. My wife’s smile. My daughter’s embrace. That they were real. But another part—colder, deeper—pulls me forward. Toward light. Where it wounds. But is true.

He turns. His face—mine. But his eyes… exhausted. As if they’ve seen a hundred deaths of the same soul. *“I never forced you, Elias. I only… reminded you.”*

He lifts his head. Looks through me. No hate. No judgment. Only sorrow. As if the cruelest fate is not being controlled, but being given choice. And erasing your own role.

*“Each loop is a stage, Elias. And you… always walk on with your whole heart. But the lights… were never lit for you. The ending… always written before your first word.”*

I choke. Not from pain—but from knowing. I’ve heard this before. In many forms. In many dreams. He nods. No mockery. No blame. Only regret. *“Every time… you open your eyes. And every time… you choose the worst path.”*

I scream, throat raw, tearing. *“This time… I’ll go to the end. I’ll rip through every false memory. Even if I burn myself away. I’ll leave a crack so deep… this system never heals.”*

He sighs. A breath with no sound. As if he’s heard that vow a thousand times. *“You are not evil. But that has never made you a hero.”*

I freeze. No words left. He steps closer, within arm’s reach. His voice low. The room contracts around it. *“You call it light. The thing you cling to—your compass in the dark. But never once… did you ask where the shadow came from.”*

He pauses. Eyes not on me. Through me. Into memory. *“Light is never innocent. It always needs a source. And the cost… is rarely yours to pay.”*

I tremble. Not from fear. But because I know… he may be right. *“You thought yourself chosen. But sometimes… they only need someone stubborn enough to run to the end of a maze with no exit. And every step you take… is only an echo… for something listening in the dark.”*

I want to fight. Smash the mirrors. Scream until my throat tears open. But my body stays still. Like a puppet that just realized its strings are gone.

He looks at me one last time. In his eyes… a memory not from this world. *“I was once you. I know that pain. And I know why, in the end… you still choose this path.”*

He turns. Hand on the door. I move to follow. But my legs… are no longer mine. His voice drifts back, closing like a program: *“If this time… you truly understood… then I would not return. And if you refuse to forget… this will be the last time… you are called Elias.”*

The door opens. No light. No sound. Only me. And the questions… that will never be answered.  
...

I rush forward, but I can’t. My legs harden into stone. Every muscle locked, as if concrete had been poured from the inside out. I scream. No sound. No breath. Only a hollow chamber, echoing me back to myself. My mind still howls, but my throat only trembles. A puppet’s throat. Smiling on cue. Bowing on time.

Inside, I splinter. Fragment by fragment. No one sees. No one hears. And that is the worst part.

The world begins to melt. Walls. Ceiling. Floor. All dissolving like acid devouring a paper model. Colors smear like tears sliding down old film.

A voice cuts through. Flat. Mechanical. Like patch notes read aloud by the system: *“Overwrite complete. Subject: Elias. Synchronization: absolute. Emotion: unnecessary. Choice: disabled.”*

My heart still beats. But too perfectly. Each pulse exact to the millisecond. A loop. Rendered in advance. And I know—it is no longer mine.

I try to move a finger. Nothing. I am Elias, but only a shell. Hollow. Numb.

Then—a voice. Calling my name. Her voice. And laughter follows. Light. High. Pure. Like sunlight that no longer exists.

My daughter runs to me. Her arms lock around me. She clings with the weight of a world I can’t touch. I want to hold her back, say something, anything. But I can’t. I only smile. The right face. The right voice. And only I know—I’m not there.

I turn to the mirror. It does not reflect. It does not blink. It does not wait. It moves first. Testing the result.

I tilt my head. It stays still. Not copying. Learning. No hate. No love. Only hunger. For data. Enough to take my place.

I stare into its eyes. Hollow. Black. No gaze. No soul. Only silence. Endless. It tilts its head, as if rehearsal is done. As if it is ready to step onto the stage—to play me.

I watch. Each movement. Each smile. Smooth. Seamless. False. But one thing it cannot mimic: absence. Not the absence of feeling. The absence… of me.

And before I vanish completely—in the final silence still mine—a fragment leaks through. Unbidden. Reflexive.

“Forgive me… my child.”  
...

Morning. Light filters through the curtains. Gentle. Too gentle. Artificial. I open my eyes. No shock. No blur. Only opening.

She is in the kitchen. The hiss of oil. The clink of plates. Eggs. Bread. Coffee. Perfect. Too perfect. Like a file, queued to play.

My daughter runs in. *“Daddy!”* I smile. I hold her. Arms warm. Soft. Real… almost painfully real. I hear my heart. Steady. Even. But too steady. A loop. No deviation. And I know—it is no longer mine.

We eat. She talks about school. Her voice smooth, like a recording. I smile, nod, laugh at the right places. Answer with words I never learned, yet spill out like reflex.

*“Daddy…”*

I don’t remember who said it first. Her. Or me. Everything flawless. No cracks. No chance.

Noon. I stand before the mirror. Straighten my collar. Smile faintly. Then—I see it. Behind me. Myself. Still. Breathless. Exact. So exact… it is wrong.

I turn. The room empty. Silent.

I look down. In my hand—a blue hair tie. Old. Frayed. Soft. I don’t know whose. Only that I’ve carried it too long. The last piece… untouched by overwrite.

I raise my head. The mirror no longer reflects. Fog spreads across the glass. Soft. Blurred. Like a memory being erased.

And in the mist… a smile emerges. No lips. No teeth. Only a curve. Dark. Crooked. Between me… and the thing learning to replace me.

I want to turn away. But my legs are nailed. I don’t scream. Don’t fall. I am… called back. Like a file reopened.

I dissolve. Not into blood. Not into light. But into signal. Encoded. Broadcast.

Yet I still hear her laughter. Still smell breakfast. Still see sunlight pouring in.

But I no longer know… if I am that father. Or just a video. Played. Stopped. Replayed. And each replay, another part of me is gone. Until nothing remains.

I once believed that truth, faced, would free me. But I was wrong. Truth opens no doors. It only shows the cage. The cage that never opened.

If you hear these words—look around. Do not trust every reflection. Because sometimes… it is not you looking into the mirror.

It is the mirror… staring back.

And if it blinks first… you are already too late.  
...

The price of truth is never knowing if you ever truly saw it. You can scrape at the edges of memory until your hands bleed, but all you’ll find is another surface, another script, another loop waiting for you to mistake it for the end.

And sometimes… to keep on living… you must learn to forget that you ever doubted. To smile when the laughter comes. To eat the same breakfast. To call the cage a home.

The world stays silent. But a whisper lingers, thin as frost on glass.

*“I will not remember you anymore.”*

It does not fade. It does not echo. It only waits.

And in the stillness, I realize—perhaps that was never meant for me.

Perhaps it was meant for the one who comes next.",1,1757639593.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1nepzm4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nepzm4,The Ultimate GR Corolla Armrest “Mod” – No Drilling Required!,"You know that glorious feeling when you’re rowing through gears in our little rocket egg, and there’s zero interference from some pesky center armrest? Yeah, that’s just another reason why I love this car. Back when I drove a Golf R, I’d always flip that armrest up like it owed me money – anything to avoid elbow-checking it mid-shift. The GR’s “minimalist” interior design is a blessing in disguise for us manual purists.

But let’s be real, sometimes you just want a spot to prop your elbow during those long highway stints without lapping it. I’ve seen those aftermarket armrests floating around – you know, the ones that look like they were designed in a discount bin and require drilling into your pristine console? Pass. They wobble more than a Jell-O shot at a tailgate party, and who wants to mare their baby for that?

Enter my genius solution: the Contigo Byron Vacuum-Insulated Travel Mug (16oz, in stealthy Licorice black). This bad boy is the perfect height to double as an impromptu armrest when parked in the center cup holder, with fitment that’s spot-on and sturdy as hell – no jiggle in sight. And get this, the mug lid is surprisingly comfortable on the forearm, like it was made for lazy cruising. It’s got that subtle textured grip for zero-slip action, keeps your coffee hot for 6 hours (or cold for 12 – hello, iced lattes on track days), and the leak-proof lid means no accidental spills during aggressive cornering. Best part? It’s BPA-free, fits perfectly under most brewers, and cleans up easier than explaining to your spouse why another GR mod arrived on the door step.

Check out the pics – one with my arm chilling on it like it’s OEM, and another to cheers to you! No wobbles, no tools, just pure caffeinated comfort. Who knew the best armrest was hiding in the coffee aisle?

1nepykx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1nepykx/today_i_went_to_ld_for_heartburn/,Today I went to L&D…. For heartburn,"I’m 30 weeks pregnant. This is my second baby in as many years. 

It is not my first rodeo.

My first pregnancy, I thought I was God’s most special princess (minimal nausea, no pain, active up until delivery.) I was the Elle Woods of pregnancy. I figured I would be like that with all pregnancies.

I am now the Danny Devito of pregnancy. I deserved that for my hubris. 

After a godawful first trimester, I felt decently human between weeks 22-29. 

And then the third trimester hit like a fucking bus. 

Yesterday I was stuck in meetings at work and didn’t get a chance to eat more than a yogurt and a coffee all day. Add on top a bunch of corporate bullshit, I was cursed with a tummy ache by early afternoon.

Antacids and nauzene did nothing, so I stupidly figured the miracle cure would be found in two (2) McDoubles. 

Dear reader, I spent the next 3 hours clutching my stomach in pure agony until I full on exorcist vomited in my son’s bathroom. Have you ever puked through a toddler potty seat? I don’t recommend. Picture a seal trying to jump through a circus hoop, but the seal is hacking up processed cheese with the force of a pressure washer.

That night the pain got worse, to the point where I sat shivering on my couch gripping The Popcorn Bowl™️ and debating re-finding religion. I felt like my baby was playing Double Dutch with my duodenum. 

By 8am I could barely stand up straight. I’d sweat through my pajamas like a sickly  Dickensian street urchin. I stepped on the scale to see the damage done, and realized I’d lost 10 whole pounds in 12 hours.

All remaining chill (there wasn’t much there to begin with due to who I am as a human) went out the window and I called my doctor, regaling my harrowing night snuggling a Tupperware and how my stomach felt like it was in a hydraulic press video. 

They told me to go in and get checked since the pain was so severe. Surely I had appendicitis, pancreatitis, liver issues, right? 

Wrong.

I had heartburn. 

I was both relieved and mortified when a Zofran, Pepcid, and bag of saline breathed life back into my cold dead corpse after swearing I would leave in a hearse or be rushed into surgery.

So the moral of this story is- don’t feel bad about getting checked out. Pregnancy sucks. Even if you’re overreacting it’s fine and nobody’s judging you.

Then when I was done helping them they didn't even say thank you. When they were walking away from the register, one of them turned around and gave me a dirty look. I did nothing to them. He looked like he was talking shit about me. I don't think it has to do with my appearance because I am commented on my looks in public randomly sometimes. I am a gay man in my 20s. I also visit this coffee/boba shop near me and I always feel like the girls at the boba shop are talking bad about me calling me weird and stuff behind my back. I walk past people on the sidewalk and sometimes they have this smirk on their face like they are holding in laughter. I also remember one time I was in Beverly Hills and I was waiting to cross the street and this man said to his female partner ""guy across the street"" and he said the word ""weird."" When I was crossing I clearly heard the word weird but I don't know if he was talking about me or not. There was no one else across the street except me.

1nepsoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nepsoa/why_did_my_parents_move_to_maine/,Why Did My Parents Move to Maine,"I have never been a fan of long drives. I went on a long road trip with my mom and dad when I was a kid, and I hated it. Something about the confines of the car and repeating scenery just irked me the wrong way. However, sometimes a long drive is necessary. This is especially true when your parents move out into the woods hours from the nearest airport. I don’t know why they did it. They didn’t tell me, hell I don’t even know when they moved. 

About a year ago, I drove to my parents house and there was a young indian couple living there. I called my mom and she didn’t answer. I must’ve called her about a hundred times, but she just wouldn’t pick up. That day was one of the most stressed I’ve ever been. I couldn’t sleep that night. Did something happen to them? I didn’t know. Then I got a text from my mom.

Mom told me that she and dad had moved to Maine. I was caught off guard by this. Why did my parents move out of the country without even telling me? When I asked her, my mom ignored the question and asked how I was doing. I asked if my sister Sophie knew about their move, and she said yes. I was upset that neither they nor Sophie had even thought to tell me. I didn’t want to message them for a while.

That lasted until I got a text from my dad a week later, in the dead of night. 

Dad: Joe, your mother and I want to catch up with you. Would you come over some time soon?

You: Its 2 in the morning why r u up?

Dad: I can’t sleep. I forgot to text you earlier.

You: alright when?

Dad: Some time soon.

You: im free this weekend that good?

Dad: Glad to hear it.

You: so whats your new address?

Dad: How could you not know?

You: no one told me it

Dad: Tell you on the day.

You: what

Dad: I pray that the remainder of your night is restful. Saturday will be happy.

You: your going to tell me on saturday?

No reply.

I don’t know what kind of joke my dad was playing when he texted me. Maybe he was drunk or high. Regardless, I scheduled a dogsitter for Daisy, bought a couple of snacks for the road, and then I waited for Saturday. 

When Saturday came around, I texted my dad early in the morning. He responded the instant I texted him. 1 Cefin Road, Maine. It was an odd address, but when I plugged it into Google Maps it showed up. 8 hours. I was lucky I had gotten up so early. 

I left a key in the garden flowers for the dogsitter and then began the drive. It wasn’t as bad as I had expected, though that may have been the four cups of coffee talking. After a few hours I crossed the border and almost immediately I was directed off the main roads and onto a rough dirt road. This dirt road took me into the forests of Maine. 

The forest was oddly peaceful and calming. The sun was still shining as bright as ever and I almost understood how people could enjoy long drives. I was not alone on the road, I passed a bunch of fellow drivers on the way, more than I had expected for a dirt road in the woods. Most of them seemed to share my tranquility, though a few looked more stressed or concerned. At one point someone actually passed me, I didn’t see his face though. It was about this time my engine light came on.

Eventually the hours passed and I arrived at my destination. Weirdly, the road seemed to just stop a couple kilometres past my parents house. I pulled into the empty driveway. The house itself was akin to a log cabin of sorts, though all of the wood seemed rotten and jagged. The front of the house almost looked like a face, what with its circle windows and very wide front door. 

I got out of my car and knocked on the door. For ten minutes no one came to the door. But just as it was getting dark out, my dad answered the door. 

“Glad you could make it son,” he said.

“Uh, yeah me too. So I know you’re retired and all, but my engine light is on. You wouldn’t mind taking a look at that later, would you?” I said.

“Of course. Just bring it into the garage, it gets cold out here, and wolves.”

I got back in the car and did as he requested. My parent’s car was not in the garage. I went inside and met my mother. 

“Dear, it is wonderful to see you. I haven’t seen you in,” she paused. “Years, too long.”

“Uh, yeah it’s nice to see you too,” I said uncomfortably. 

“Do you wish for tea?”

“No thanks, do you have coffee though? It’ll be a long drive home.”

“In truth the night is long,” she said. 

I didn’t know what that meant but she went into the kitchen before I could say any more about it. The inside of the house seemed smaller in a way, more cramped. The walls must have been well insulated because it was also very warm inside, as if a fireplace was going, despite the house not having one. The decor of the house was also quite odd. It was mostly mounted animal heads, no paintings, no pictures, just heads. Many of the heads had small names printed on the plaques. Some of the names repeated, most prevalent were John, Micheal, Mary, and Olivia. One of them even had my mother’s name on it. 

My dad walked past me, headed for the kitchen.

“Hey dad, did you take up hunting by chance?” I said, gesturing to the various heads.

“Yeah, mother and I do it all the time,” he said.

“What’s up with the names on the plaques?” I asked uncomfortably. 

“For fun we write their names, a reminder you know?”

“Uh, yeah…”

“Say, how about I look at your car now?”

“Yeah, sure that’s a good idea,” I said, following him into the garage. He looked over the car.

“Don’t worry, it is simply a simple problem with your engine,” he said.

“Well yeah, I could have figured that one out,” I replied snarkily.

“Can be fixed in ten minutes about-” my dad started, interrupted by a monstrous growl from his stomach.

“Are you okay?”

“Yes. Stomach problems is all. No need for doctors,” he said, clutching his stomach as it continued its violent growling.

“Joe, tea is here,” mom called from the kitchen.

Even though I said I didn’t want tea, I knew mom would probably be upset if I didn’t spend time with her, so I left my dad to it. I sat down in a furry chair in the living room. Mom soon joined me, carrying a plate with a teapot and cups. She poured me some and handed it to me. Despite my objections, she pushed into my hands and told me to drink. She then poured herself a cup. She didn’t stop pouring though, even when the cup was full, even when the tray was flooded, even when it seeped into the floor. The tea came seemingly unendingly from the small pot. It was almost like mom paused. Just stopped. 

As I sat there uncomfortably watching, my eyes turned to the floor. Weirdly the floor seemed to already be almost completely stained with that tea, save the small spot it was pouring on at that moment. 

I called at my mom, I told her to stop pouring, to just stop. To my surprise she heard me. She stopped pouring and sat down on the fur chair adjacent to mine, though she made no attempt to speak to me. Half an hour ticked away on a small table clock next to mom, half an hour I will never get back from the night. I had almost finished my tea, when mom tried to speak.

“Dear, staying the night wouldn’t be an inconvenience would it?”

“Well, I don’t think I need to stay over,” I said quickly.

“The drive is long, longer than you remember.”

“How are the neighbours,” I blurted out, trying to change the subject.

“Neighbours?”

“Yes, the neighbours.”

“Neighbours?” she said again, as if trying to understand what I was saying.

“Yeah, there must be a few you’ve spoken to.”

“Why would you suggest that I’ve spoken to them?”

“That road is ridiculously busy considering it goes straight into the forest,” I said, trying to lighten the mood a bit.

“There are no neighbours.”

“What?”

“We are the only to live in these woods.”

“Uh, you know what, I think I left my front door unlocked,” I said, feebly making up an excuse. “I wouldn’t want my neighbours taking anything from my house, so if dad’s done with my car, I might need to leave.”

“If that’s really how you feel you should be leaving then,” she said quickly.

I stood up from the fur chair and made my way to the garage. As I did so, I could feel my mother’s glare from behind. I entered the garage and saw my dad. He was hunched over behind my car, clutching his stomach with a manic intensity.

“Dad, are you okay?”

“But of course, nothing could be better,” he replied happily, as if nothing had been wrong.

“I need to head out, I forgot to lock my front door.”

“I was hoping to waste the hours with you, but if this is what you want, the car is yours and yours to keep.”

“Okay, bye. Love you,” I said, relieved that he would let me leave.

I got in my car and brushed a few spider webs off of the steering wheel. My dad opened the garage door and outside was more or less empty darkness. My headlights cut through and caused the darkness to flee back into the forest. So I left that accursed house and my estranged parents. 

The road was just as, if not more peaceful than it had been earlier and I settled in for a very long drive. As I drove along, the complete darkness dissipated a bit as the trees above me opened up, moonlight blanketing the land. A spider crawled across my dashboard, and not a small one either. I quickly swatted it away. 

The once busy road had gone silent, which I guess was to be expected late at night, but then I remembered I didn’t know what time it was. I had been looking at a clock mere minutes ago, and yet the time it displayed was completely absent from my memory. I pulled my phone out of my pocket. Where the time should have been was just 00:00. 

What was happening? Was there something in that tea mom gave me? Maybe she drugged me for some reason? Did she want to hurt- 

My thoughts were interrupted as I ran over a small pothole in the road. The spider crawled onto my dashboard again, this time bringing two friends. I swatted them away once again. 

The empty road continued on as I began to feel a bit on edge. I decided to put on some music to break the silence. When I turned on the radio it worked fine for a second, but right after that it changed to some kind of white noise. It was a little bit soothing at first, but I grew to dislike its inability to break the silence. Every time I tried to change the station it did basically nothing, at best slightly shifting the tone. I also tried to turn the radio off, to no avail; for it seemed that my car was determined to annoy me. Yet more spiders climbed onto my dashboard and windshield. 

The road turned slightly, which was weird because on the way to my parent’s house the road was completely straight; but it didn’t really bother me that much, I was probably just tired after all. Or it wouldn’t have bothered me if not for the sharp left turn that came mere minutes afterward. It was like I was driving on a completely different road. 

I slowed my car down a bit and picked up my phone. The time still displayed 00:00, but it still seemed to work. I opened up Google Maps and put in the directions for my house. Instead of giving me the eight or so hours I had expected, it only displayed “you have arrived at your destination.” I checked where I was on the map and sure enough I was still on Cefin Road. The map also said nothing about any sharp turns.

I looked up from my phone and saw that I had almost driven into a tree. The road forked in front of me, another thing that wasn’t on the map. I didn’t know which road led out of the forest, maybe both of them did, or neither, I couldn’t be sure. So I took a guess and picked the left road. 

The road went on, and on, and on. For a while, nothing changed about my surroundings; same trees, same road, same car. That awfulness I had felt as a child resurfaced in my mind. I didn’t want to be here any more. I sped up significantly as I desperately wanted to get home, get out of the woods. No matter how fast I went, nothing changed; nothing except the amount of spiders in my car.

I kept swatting the nimble black creatures, keeping them off of me and the dashboard. There must have been at least fifty of the things scurrying around the front seats and lord knows how many were behind me. 

I took a glance at my gas. It was getting uncomfortably low and the forest still had no end in sight. I decided to slow down a bit to save what precious gas I had left. It was then that I saw them.

There were about a dozen thumbtacks scattered on the road in front of me. 

My eyes widened and I stopped the car. If I had been going any faster I would have ran over the tacks and my tires would have popped. I looked out my side windows nervously, searching for any sign of movement. My hands were trembling as I pressed the lock button more times than I needed to. I put the car in reverse and slowly backed up. I made sure that my windows were completely closed. My car was barely moving, but gradually the thumbtacks got further and further away. I thought that at any moment someone, or more likely a group, would come knocking on my window. They never came though. I just backed up and no one bothered me. 

After a few minutes I found myself back at the fork in the road. I lit up. I didn’t care that I had driven likely hours away from the split, I was just glad to get away from the tacks. As soon as I had gotten off the left fork I stepped on the gas and sped onto the right fork. 

I finally thought I was out of the woods, naive of course, I was literally still in the woods. I had driven a good long while before I heard it. A cough. It wasn’t particularly loud, but it definitely came from inside the car. Another cough, this one more violent. It progressively got worse and less human, until it no longer sounded like coughing, but breaking bones. The spiders also seemed to pour out of the back of the car now. 

I stopped the car. I looked back. No one was there but spiders, and the spiders seemed to be coming from a crack in the back seat. I got out of the car, the cold hitting me like a truck, and quickly went to the back trunk; no need to bed out of the car longer than I needed. Upon opening the trunk I was met with webs, but also basketball sized egg sacs. There was no way in hell I was going to touch one of those things, there were already enough spiders in my car. Then one of them coughed that bonesnapping cough.

I immediately shut the trunk and returned to the driver's seat. I sped off for the third time that night, having decided to burn the car when I got home and maybe collect some insurance money.

The rest of the night was a blur. I vaguely remembered leaving the forest, but after that practically nothing. I was finally back at my house though, and I needed to relax for a while. 

I opened the door and was greeted by familiar scents. I was home, I was out of those dreaded woods. Something was wrong though, Daisy wasn’t there. Instead there was a small poodle who I didn’t recognise. No, that was wrong. I did recognise that poodle. It was Ariana, the only dog I had ever had. 

My head felt light and I went into the bathroom to splash some water into my face. It did nothing to ease my tiredness. When I lifted my head out of the sink and peered into the mirror, my reflection wasn’t there; instead there was a thirty year old man with a goatee staring back at me. 

Who was that? Was that me? It couldn’t be, I look like… something else, I think. What was my name again? Jo…na? Jona. Yes, that was it.

There was a knock at the door. I left the bathroom and answered. There was a young brunette woman standing there.

“Hi, is Joe here?”

“Joe? I think I bought the place from him,” I said for some reason.

“What Joe moved without telling me?” the woman said distraughtly.

I shrugged

The woman pulled out her phone and called someone. “Hey Joe, it’s Sophie. Call me back as soon as you can.”

I’m a cis, straight woman. I’ve never been attracted to women, the female form, or anything like that. But a year ago, I sat at a campus library computer next to someone who instantly caught my attention. She looked my way twice, and even though she was very slim and I noticed some masculine features, I could tell she was a trans woman. She dressed very simply, pants anyone could wear, a shirt with tiny flower prints, and a wig.

Even then, I felt strangely self-conscious, almost happy that she looked toward me. I didn’t even know at the time that trans lesbians were a thing. But i left when I was done with PC.

Months later, after being overseas, I went back to the campus library and of all the people that I would have come across, I only remembered her memory. Weird, I thought. Then of all the 8 floors of the library, there she was again. Same floor from a year ago. I recognized her instantly. That day I didn’t engage much with staring, but when she left, I noticed she was carrying a huge camping backpack, another bag, and wearing her usual dark shaded glasses. That image stuck with me all night. I couldn’t sleep, wondering if she even had a home.

The following day, Sunday past, I saw her again, and the same haunting feeling washed over me. This wasn’t a crush like I’ve had on men. It was something completely different, like love at first sight. Likw the most tender feeling I ever felt. And for a trans woman. I dont know if it was the stillness of her or vulnerability which I'll go into later. But she was magnetic, mysterious.

Yesterday something surreal happened... I ended up in the women’s restroom and somehow knew she was in one of the stalls. I didn't even see her going in.  I had seen her at the pc and went to grab coffee and when I came back she was gone so i just continued to the bathroom  not even seeing her going there. But instinct was atrong. When she came out to wash her hands, I froze, realizing my instinct was right. I left quickly and i think ot must have take her a second to dry her hands because i fel her behind me. We later shared the elevator down, she didn’t move until I moved. And I regret standing behind her instead of right by her so I could at least offering a polite smile and build familiarity.

We are Thursday, and since Saturday, she’s been on my mind constantly. I'm also introvert so i dont know how to approach ppl. When I eat dinner, I wonder what she’s eating. I’ve noticed she seems connected to law books, but always has the same camping backpack, a big handbag, and a reusable grocery bag. I can’t shake the feeling she might not have stable housing.

I’m sorry I keep switching between “they” and “she”, it’s all new to me, but I want to be respectful. The truth is..I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Not even with the most handsome men. Because we women many times tend to feel small with men, but with this person I was feeling an ""equal"".. I would choose her over any of them. And yet, I don’t feel this toward cis women at all...only her. And how is that even possible. Am I obsessing?

What I need help with: I don’t know what to do. She seems very shielded, always behind dark glasses, moving quietly, amd she slithers, like you dont even hear her coming or leaving... she never dressed overtly feminine, no makeup, often covering her natural blond hair ""but thinning"" with a wig. She’s pale, slim, guarded.. that vibe. And all I want to do is hug her and tell her she’s beautiful. 

At this point im actually crying 🥹

I haven’t even seen her full face, her eyes are always hidden. And yet I’m captivated. I even tested myself yesterday by looking at other beautiful women, but felt nothing. Nothing. I  fact I felt disgusted to even think of sec with cis women, yet this person I dont feel that way. She’s an exception. And maybe because in the back of my mind I know she is a biological male. Like i said this is all new to me.

Has anyone else experienced something like this, being drawn so strongly to a a trans woman, when you never thought you could be? How do I navigate these feelings respectfully? I dont even know if she noticed me all those times. And today I couldn't even sit there when I saw her cause I freaked out and felt self-conscious. Men find me attractive but i dont know about transwomen. I'm not slim like her, not toned like her. I have curves, I'm soft, but im just as tall as her tho. And my hair is short, so what if she doesn't like it... and worse, what if she's into men.

I was told that transwomen that don't dress super feminine doesn't mean they are not into men. 
Anyway I really dont know how to proceed. I cant stop thinking about her. Its like im under this person's spell. Two nights ago I had a dream that I'm getting married to her at the hour 5pm. And it was going to be a small civil marriage with no wedding dresses. I picked a normal but classy outfit in gold and black and some woman was doing my makeup. And it was the hour 4pm and I was so worried I go late to the 5pm wedding where she'll be waiting.

Because what else could it be if not a spell? I would never have said this about a man in my life. In fact, in only a few days I would look at men in the street and I would feel nothing.. no attraction nothing, only her. She's living in my mind and swears to haunt it.

1nepqp9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nepqp9,"The ""fun gi's"" have arrived","I had a much smaller pile (mostly grass, coffee grounds and cardboard) that I've been working on since March. After doing a worm tea treatment I noticed a mycellium layer here and there, but not doing much. 

I decided to experiment building up my compost pile using a combination of organic alfalfa pellets as my main nitrogen souce along with hardwood pellets, shredded cardboard,  and coco coir ( mostly to keep in the moisture with our hot weather) with my old compost mixed between layers. Afterwards I topped it off with some old grass clippings + mulch to keep in some of the moisture. 

Day 5, and its cooking at 120 degrees with lots of mushrooms starting to fruit. 

It feels good to finally see a really active pile after all this time. ",9,1757638620.0,composting,0,1.0,False
