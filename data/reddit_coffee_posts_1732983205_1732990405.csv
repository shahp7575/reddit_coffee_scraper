I don't have any other outlet para malabas to since yung circle of friends namin the same lang. For context I (M23) can't stop my self my from liking my bestfriend (F23). I don't really know when did this started but during those past months we build a special connection, we shared a meal together, shared a tumbler, shared a coffee, and stories. I guess the biggest reason why I fell in love with you is because everytime we are together, you give me peace. But all of that will have to stop I guess, I just heard the news that you are back together with your bf after leaving you hanging for months. I was there when you needed a shoulder to cry on, I was also there to make you laugh everytime I notice that you become quiet (i've known her for a while for me to know when she is in good or bad mood). I didn't regret din na hindi ko man lang sayo nasabi nararamdaman ko pero ang sakit pa din pala sobra na makita kang masaya sa iba, ayoko na maramdaman to, gusto ko maging kaibigan nalang talaga tingin ko sayo.

I'd gone to pick up a perfume for myself at the mall and the perfume counter cashier gave me a free sample of another one. I already had it and was trying to decide who to give this sample to as I left. Neither my mother nor MIL wear perfume and I don't have friends who live nearby. I walked over to the restaurant where I was meeting my family for lunch. Because I came so early I sat at the bar and ordered a coffee. I asked the young woman tending the bar if she would like the sample for herself. I worried she might think I was strange for offering but she loved the scent and thanked me. When I asked to close my tab she waved it away and told me it was on the house. I was startled by her generosity and as an asocial person by nature it's rare I have a feel-good moment with another person. Folks can be so kind.,3,1732990106.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

1h3ig9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1h3ig9u/tildas_art_bunker/,Tilda's Art Bunker,"This post is for u/friendliest_sheep and u/DarkShadowStorm, at their request. Sorry for the delay, hennies. I mentioned Tilda‚Äôs art bunker in a comment and how saturated it is with symbolism, and they asked me to elaborate at length. I know it's been done before, I don't care, we're rehashing it anyway. And I have length, babes, so go to the loo now.



I do not like Tilda as a person and I will not be objective. This is a very long shit-talk post. She is a billionaire bastard and a groomer that would make Humbert Humbert himself balk at her temerity. But as a character and a villain? She is fucking amazing. The writers brought their A-game; Carrie-Ann Moss played her unethical Machiavellian lesbian to the nines. It was a slam dunk from start to finish.¬†



And a great part of Tilda‚Äôs characterisation comes from her the art she possesses. Everything around her is highly deliberate and curated, as are the things she says and, perhaps more importantly, omits in her retelling. The comfort art gives her is to fill the emptiness where a sould should be., The voids she leaves have meaning too, the silence speaks volumes, even more truthfully than Tilda is capable of. You can learn just as much about Tilda studying what she obfuscates as what she tells you outright. The tinder bio of the ages, complete with opera music in the background to seem elevated and sophisticated, when it really just comes off as creepy, like a vampire movie, bouncing off those cold stone walls. 



Tilda also reads Aloy‚Äôs reactions and thoughts while she‚Äôs lecturing; to gauge how like Lis Aloy is, but also how to counter Aloy‚Äôs negative impressions and steer her towards a favourable opinion. The scene is a masterclass in dialogue. 



So, starting off with the first art pairing in her bunker; the Vermeer (Woman reading a letter) and the fake Vermeer next to it. Tilda talks with great affection for this pairing. The Vermeer original symbolises Elisabet, and the fake Aloy, or maybe at Beta, or even both to varying degrees.¬†

The original is smaller, older, blurrier. Like a faded memory, especially when juxtaposed with the forgery, representing Lis‚Äô clones. The forged Vermeer is larger, clearer, more detailed, and of course newer, younger. Almost as if the forger expanded on the original work. Tilda talks herself warm about the mastery of the older original, but concedes that perhaps there is just as much skill to the fake; even saying outright that the forgery gains its exceptional value not on its own merit, but when the original is evident. Kind of implying that without Lis to strive towards, Aloy (and Beta) are less remarkable. That as their own selves, they do not reach Lis‚Äô lofty heights.¬†



I think she says this to prime Aloy to be more like Lis. She already failed moulding Beta into her. ‚ÄúIt tells us more and yet we feel less,‚Äù she says, and it feels like it hints to Beta not stirring the same level of attraction as Lis did. Considering Beta comes across as younger than Aloy, and canonically might be as young as 15, this repulses me. And as someone who grew up with a narrative of you possessing great potential, *if only you changed a little bit,* the lines here make me quite cross on a personal level.



They talk about the painting in itself; Aloy talks about the woman in it looking troubled and unable to put her goings-on down. Representing Aloy herself, of course, but what Tilda hears is how like Lis Aloy is being here. Lis too was a workaholic. And Tilda observed Lis like the painter, the observer ogles the woman reading the letter. Studying her, admiring her.¬†



Moving on to the next painting; Selene and Endymion, with Cupid next to the moon goddess. Tilda likens her love for Lis to Selene‚Äôs to her mortal shepherd, with Cupid‚Äôs torch representing Tilda‚Äôs thousand-year-long obsession and chagrin with her ex. Tilda likens herself to the goddess, of course, and not the mere mortal. Both of them are immortal, shimmering white and hovering in the air. If advanced enough technology truly is akin to magic, then Tilda has magical powers too. Tilda even adopts a hushed tone, talking into Aloy‚Äôs ear, trying to seem like they‚Äôre talking in confidence in a completely empty room, about how their love was forbidden. Forbidden love, one of the most romantic and compelling narratives. A sticky, fumbling attempt to make Aloy sympathise with Tilda. She doesn‚Äôt buy it of course, and I love that for her.¬†



The next painting is Rembrandt‚Äôs painting of the prophet Jeremiah. Again, Tilda likens herself to the prophet in a very self-pitying tone. Oh, how Tilda foresaw the end of Earth, just¬† like Jeremiah foresaw the fall of Jerusalem. Tilda talks about the treasures Jeremiah saved, and Aloy calls her out for saving relics rather than people and Tilda defends herself, saying that oh, but she tried, but no one would heed her, so she saved what greatness she could, for others to enjoy. Except in Tilda‚Äôs case, the whole planet died. What is the point of saving art when there‚Äôs no one left to admire it? To lock it away where only Tilda could admire it? Another evidence to just how selfish Tilda is. And Aloy sees it too. When she calls ‚ÄúJeremiah‚Äù on the hypocrisy, Tilda dismisses the thinly veiled criticism; ‚Äúwhat matters is that Jeremiah was right.‚Äù Sure, Tilda, you rancid, sanctimonious sow.¬†

I don‚Äôt know which is worse, likening yourself to a prophet or a goddess, but both ick me.¬†



The fourth painting is another of Rembrandt‚Äôs. Titus in a monk‚Äôs hood. About loss and looking at the past and the dead with love and honesty, as a light in the darkness, rather than with garish, colourful artifice. Tilda sees Lis in Titus‚Äô visage, but Aloy thinks of Varl, understandably given how fresh the loss is.¬†

And Tilda immediately swoops in with sympathy as thick as molasses. ‚ÄúIf only,‚Äù she says. If only she could‚Äôve intervened sooner, if only she could‚Äôve saved Varl, if only she could‚Äôve stopped Beta from being kidnapped. If only, if only. All lies, of course. Tilda chose her moment with surgical precision. At a moment where Aloy was despondent, she swooped in like an angel to save the day. A person in mourning and with great catastrophe looming is easier to influence, after all. Especially without Beta there to tell on Tilda‚Äôs grooming techniques. Aloy now has two vacancies in her friend group, and that is ample room for a snake to slither in.¬†



The Night Watch. A girl symbolising the spirit of victory and virtue, weaving her way between self-important leader types in big armour. Sounds like a certain ginger we know, does it not? Tilda is trying to show Aloy that she sees how Aloy works in obscurity. Not obscurity meaning that Aloy works in secret‚Ä¶ More meaning that Aloy shrugs personal glory and does not stop to bask in her fame. If she did, she‚Äôd never get anything done. Not in the way she is now.¬†



The Gust. This one I take beef with. Tilda saved this one for last out of the paintings, and that is no coincidence. A scrappy little ship striving in a dark and stormy seas towards a bright horizon. The painting was made in 1680, an age where Europeans were setting out at sea in all manner of directions. Looking for new lands to conquer and colonise. But Tilda does not divulge this bit. Because the ship represents Far Zenith. She talks of the ship, and by extension her little billionaire socialite club, as setting out in the spirit of discovery and adventure. So that Aloy will think of them as daring and like herself. Even the real-life billionaires we see today like to compare themselves to some glorified Star Trek future, but they forget that Star Trek is a space communism society that no longer deals with money and takes great pains to process the ethics everywhere they go. Elon could *never,* gorge. 



What Tilda obfuscates, of course, is what colonisers did to the places they settled and the people who lived there. Whether Dutch, Spanish, English, French, Portuguese‚Ä¶ They all had a roster of sins they cycled through in their colonies. Plundering, pillaging, theft, slavery, murder, rape, torture, dismemberment. That was not the narrative they took home to their families; the people at home learned only of the people the sailors had met (which they often considered at best savages but more likely sub-human) and saw the (stolen) wealth their returning kin brought home. Extracting all the wealth they possibly could from these faraway places and spilling a lot of blood in the process. Entirely unethical, outright evil, just how billionaires are today in real life. There is no ethical way to be a billionaire, and there is no ethical way to be a coloniser, no matter how you twist the truth, like a colourful kaleidoscope, obscuring the crass cost of your wealth and comfort.¬†The coloniser told tehmselves they were ""civilising"" their colonies whilst bestowing the most barbaric savagery upon them. 



When The Gust was painted, Belgium and the Netherlands were still one country, they split up in 1830. But the following generation after that split, King Leopold II had the colonised Congo as his personal wealth factory. Leopold personally owned Congo. And during his ‚Äúownership,‚Äù he demanded this country produce profit for him. It was known as the Rubber Terror, or more politely the Congolese Genocide. Atrocities which led to thousands of people getting their hands cut off.

Forgive the gruesome tangent, but it has a point: This is what colonialism extolled. Ships like the one in The Gust led to these events, all over the world, and not just at the hands of the Dutch. Greed does not balk at any cruelty or viscera to acquire wealth.

Does Tilda know this bit of history? Of course she does. She even knew how many children Rembrandt had, of course she‚Äôd know this bloodstained, sordid tale of her country too. But she does not tell Aloy this; only the sunny, happy, scrappy adventure bit.

I mean‚Ä¶ To the ship, that sunny horizon outside the storm looks like salvation, right? But if you were standing on that sunlit shore, looking out to sea? What you would see from your beach‚Ä¶ is a European ship with dark ominous clouds trailing behind it, to darken your door.



Forgive me if I skip the sculptures. They are brief compared to the paintings, and speak quite evidently for themselves in the scene. I do however want to include the journey out. Aloy is in a dark bunker, headed up the steps and into the morning light, where Tilda awaits, resplendent in the morning sun, with verdant plants and the Pacific ocean as her backdrop. That dramaturgy is intentional too, as everything is with Tilda.¬†



And Tilda‚Äôs had months to restore Aloy‚Äôs discarded Focus, watch her life recordings and fantasise about this little breakfast date she‚Äôs set up on her terrace. Do you wonder if she and Tilda used to have breakfast out there too? If Tilda is just trying to relive her relationship with Lis? If the cup Aloy drinks from is the way Lis took her coffee a thousand years ago?¬†

All that flawless, shining white against the rusted, decrepit ruins of her house. A porcelain jug so reflective that the player can almost see themselves, gold rim and all. Tilda‚Äôs food printer must‚Äôve been hard at work, making those figs ([a highly yonic fruit according to DH Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzw_z6A7kgw&ab_channel=SpokenVerse) and therefore highly sapphic with Tilda choosing it) and apples (the fruit of knowledge? Aloy only takes one bite). All artifice. All lies.¬†



And Tilda lies. Outright and by omission, constantly, and has done so for a millennium. I‚Äôm gonna go on another little tangent but remember the very beginning of the game? During the tutorial where Aloy finds the recording of [ANZU ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKrwA6pHnjI&t=50s&ab_channel=JudgementVII-XX)in Far Zenith‚Äôs old facility? That narrator... She has a filter put over her voice, but her cadence is familiar, no? Sounds almost like‚Ä¶ Carrie-Ann Moss, does it not? That's because it is. It is Tilda narrating the plan to steal GAIA. So in Latopolis, when Lis yells at her and Tilda says ‚ÄúI had nothing to do with it?‚Äù Yeah, Tilda is lying through her dental veneers. Tilda was absolutely instrumental in that theft.¬†No wonder Lis dumped her, geez.

Gods, I love to hate Tilda. No, wait. Ugh. I should not speak ill of the dead. Only good things should be said about the dead, so‚Ä¶ It is good that Tilda is dead.¬†

Anyway. Thank you for reading. I worry I missed a bunch of stuff but I tried my best. The scene really moved me and challenged me and gave me so much to reflect on. This kind of depth is unmatched in my opinion and experience. And if you‚Äôre interested, you should also watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbqfsjm-OlA&ab_channel=Guerrilla). No, really, if you watch no other link in this post, make an exception for this one. I am so awestruck with this choice in Horizon Forbidden West. Not just the scriptwriting for the art bunker scene but also this incredible curator Denise Campbell. The choices were so precise and so beautifully realised into the game.¬†

Thanks again for being here, and I'd love to hear your feelings and impressions of the choices around Tilda's bunker.

I'm leaving ABA work, I was a Behavior Technician. The case I'm on is rough. My client sent me to the urgent care earlier this week and I'm concerned about long term damage. He assaulted me physically (it was not transphobically motivated) over about 1.5 hours. 

The company has safeguards because they knew this was a possibility. However the people in charge of this case ignored these and sent me there alone. While it was occurring, they refused to answer their phones. I decided that this was unacceptable so I'm going to leave.

When we first met I did some silly things like helped my ex‚Äôs parents move house ( I‚Äôd known my gf a month ) and I didn‚Äôt tell her. We also had a termination that she thought I blamed for her and last year, we went through a few weeks where we didn‚Äôt get along and I spent some time with an old gf. Nothing happened but I lent her money, got myself into a hole and she wanted more. She ended up reaching out to my gf and sending her pics of us kissing etc to mess with me. They were old pics but it was a bad week. I promised my gf I‚Äôd never keep a thing from her again and I didn‚Äôt cheat and I meant it. We moved on, 6 great months. She wanted to get engaged, I made a lot more effort, hired a car for her driving test, took her mom out, took her to work, got her coffee, Zero issues. She kept wanting to get engaged and I was going to get a ring. She also was annoyed at the distance and wanted a house with me. She was also very good and kind to me. 
5th July she messaged me on insta and says she‚Äôs done, she can‚Äôt get over what I had lied about in the past and that was it. She wouldn‚Äôt take a call. She said there‚Äôs no other man and she still loves me but she‚Äôs realised her worth and that‚Äôs it. I had literally just sent her flowers. We had a trip booked for Japan for a week later, she said we can still go. 2 days later she said she doesn‚Äôt want to go so we lose the trip and the money. I felt bad so I sent her back her half, two thousand dollars out of my savings. 
She‚Äôs blocked me on all. Her mom also sent me some horrible messages saying karma and exposure will get me? I was literally at her dinner table 2 weeks before. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs been discovered I had cheated or had a wife or something, but I hadn‚Äôt kept a thing from her. I even had a gift arrive at my home from her the same day she left me. 
I left it a month and flew out to see her with a letter and I said I was sorry for how I had made her feel and took her some of her favourite pie. She took it in and shut the door, I flew home. 
I‚Äôve heard nothing for months. She kept my friend on her social media for some reason and she reached out last night saying she was moving to England and not to tell me. My friend lives in Ohio so she wouldn‚Äôt have known anyway. Part of me wants to send her a small gift for her birthday just before Christmas but part of me is very upset by the way her and her mom have treated me, it‚Äôs as if I had a wife or kids, or I was in prison.

1. **Spain (15th - 17th Century)**
   * **Overview**: Spain emerged as a global superpower in the late 15th century, primarily due to its successful exploration and colonization efforts. The unification of Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella, along with the sponsorship of Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492, opened the Americas to European exploration. The influx of wealth from gold and silver mines in the New World, particularly in Mexico and Peru, fueled Spain's economy and allowed it to finance military campaigns and cultural endeavors. The use of gunpowder technology, particularly in cannons and firearms, gave Spanish forces a significant advantage in battles against indigenous populations and rival European powers. Gunpowder, which was invented in China during the 9th century, was brought to Europe through the Silk Road and later weaponized by European powers, including Spain, for military use. Spanish dominance in the 16th century was marked by the establishment of a vast empire that spanned the Americas, parts of Europe, and the Philippines. However, by the end of the 17th century, Spain began to face challenges, including military defeats and economic decline, which diminished its status as a superpower.
2. **Portugal (15th - 17th Century)**
   * **Overview**: Portugal became a significant global power during the Age of Discovery, driven by advancements in navigation, shipbuilding technology, and the effective use of gunpowder in naval warfare. Pioneers like Prince Henry the Navigator promoted exploration along the African coast, leading to the establishment of trade routes to India and the Spice Islands. The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which divided the New World between Spain and Portugal, allowed Portugal to claim Brazil and establish a lucrative sugar trade. The Portuguese navy utilized gunpowder weaponry to protect its trade routes and assert dominance over rival powers. The Portuguese Empire extended across Africa, Asia, and South America, making it a key player in global trade. However, by the late 17th century, competition from other European powers and internal strife weakened Portugal's influence, leading to its decline as a superpower.
3. **The Netherlands (17th Century)**
   * **Overview**: The Dutch Republic rose to prominence in the 17th century, becoming a major global superpower through trade, finance, and naval power. The Dutch East India Company (VOC), established in 1602, played a crucial role in establishing trade networks in Asia, particularly in spices and textiles. The Dutch excelled in shipbuilding and navigation, allowing them to dominate maritime trade routes. Gunpowder technology was also vital for the Dutch navy, enabling them to protect their trade interests and engage in naval battles against rivals like Spain and England. The wealth generated from trade led to a flourishing of arts and sciences during the Dutch Golden Age. However, the rise of England and France as competing naval powers, along with costly wars, eventually led to the decline of Dutch dominance by the late 17th century.
4. **Britain (18th - 19th Century)**
   * **Overview**: Britain emerged as a global superpower in the 18th century, driven by the Industrial Revolution and its extensive colonial empire. Technological advancements in manufacturing, transportation, and communication allowed Britain to produce goods more efficiently and expand its trade networks. The British Empire became the largest in history, encompassing territories in North America, the Caribbean, India, Africa, and the Pacific. The British navy, equipped with advanced gunpowder weaponry, played a crucial role in protecting trade routes and asserting dominance over rival powers. The wealth generated from colonies fueled further industrialization and military expansion. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was often referred to as ""the empire on which the sun never sets,"" reflecting its vast global reach.
5. **France (17th - 19th Century)**
   * **Overview**: France was a significant global power from the 17th century onward, with a strong influence in Europe and overseas colonies. Under the reign of Louis XIV, France expanded its territories and established a powerful military. The French colonial empire grew in North America, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa and Asia. France's involvement in global trade, particularly in sugar and coffee, contributed to its economic strength. Gunpowder technology was integral to the French military, allowing them to engage effectively in conflicts and expand their influence. However, the French Revolution in the late 18th century led to political instability and the loss of some colonies. Despite this, France remained a key player in global affairs throughout the 19th century, competing with Britain and other powers for influence and territory.
6. **Russia (18th - 19th Century)**

   * **Overview**: Russia began to emerge as a global superpower in the 18th century under the rule of Peter the Great and later Catherine the Great. Peter's reforms modernized the military and government, emphasizing the need for a strong navy and a professional army. He recognized the importance of gunpowder technology, which had been developed in Europe and was crucial for military effectiveness. Under his leadership, Russia expanded its territory through wars against Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, gaining access to the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Catherine the Great continued this expansionist policy, further extending Russian influence into Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The Russian Empire grew to encompass vast territories, becoming a significant player in global politics. The expansion was often driven by a desire for resources, strategic advantages, and the spread of Russian culture. By the end of the 19th century, Russia was recognized as one of the great powers, although it faced internal challenges, including social unrest and economic difficulties, that would later contribute to revolutionary movements in the early 20th century.



# Conclusion

From the 15th to the 19th century, the rise of global superpowers was closely tied to advancements in technology, exploration, and colonialism. The discovery and weaponization of gunpowder played a crucial role in military conflicts, allowing nations to expand their territories and assert dominance over rivals. The competition for resources, trade routes, and territory led to the establishment of vast empires, shaping the geopolitical landscape of the modern world.

1h3i5j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingErgonomic/comments/1h3i5j6/adesso_ergonomic_keyboard_a_game_changer_for/,Adesso Ergonomic Keyboard: A Game Changer for Happy Hands!,"## Discover why this keyboard is a lifesaver for your wrists and fingers.

Ever felt that dreadful numbness in your wrists after a long day at the keyboard? Well, let me tell you, I've been there - and that's exactly why I'm so excited to share my love for the Adesso ergonomic keyboard. Buckle up as we dive into the wonderful world of ergonomics, and discover how this nifty little gadget has transformed my typing experience.
  
  
## The Ergonomic Revolution

Ergonomics is like the magic wand of comfort in the world of typing. Imagine you‚Äôre sitting at your desk, fingers flying over the keys, but instead of feeling like a keyboard ninja, your wrists are screaming like they just ran a marathon. That‚Äôs where ergonomics comes in! It‚Äôs all about designing tools, like keyboards, to fit our bodies instead of making our bodies fit the tools. Simple, right? 

Traditional keyboards can be a real pain‚Äîliterally. They often force your wrists into awkward positions, which can lead to discomfort, carpal tunnel syndrome, or even tendonitis. You know, the kind of pain that makes you feel like you‚Äôve been typing with a rock for hours? Not fun! Ergonomic keyboards, on the other hand, are designed to keep your hands and wrists in a more natural position. They often have a split design or a cushioned wrist rest, which helps keep everything aligned and comfy.

I still remember my 'aha!' moment when I first stumbled upon an ergonomic keyboard. It was like a light bulb turned on in my brain! I was at a friend's house, and he showed me this fancy keyboard. As soon as I started typing, I felt like I was floating on a cloud! It was a game changer for my happy hands, and I realized I could actually enjoy typing without feeling like I was wrestling with a porcupine.

## Meet the Adesso Ergonomic Keyboard

When I first laid eyes on the ergonomic keyboard, I felt like I was unboxing a treasure. Seriously, it was like finding a long-lost relic in my office! The moment I pulled it out of the box, I noticed its unique split design. It was like the keyboard was doing a little dance, inviting my fingers to join in. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to type on something that looks like it‚Äôs ready to party?

The tenting feature was another eye-catcher. It‚Äôs designed to lift the middle section, which feels like giving your wrists a gentle hug. I could already picture my hands resting comfortably, instead of feeling like they were stuck in a weird yoga pose. And let‚Äôs not forget the wrist rest! Oh boy, it‚Äôs like a fluffy cloud for my wrists. I could practically hear them sighing in relief as I placed my hands down. 

As I set it up, the keys felt different too‚Äîlike they were just waiting for my fingers to glide over them. The tactile feedback was satisfying, almost like a little cheerleader for each letter I typed. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder, could this really be the game changer I had been hoping for? Only time would tell, but my wrists were already sending me thank-you notes!

## Setting Up Shop

Setting up your new ergonomic keyboard can feel like a mini adventure, and trust me, it‚Äôs worth every moment. First things first, find a comfortable spot on your desk. You want to avoid that awkward ""hunched-over"" look that makes you feel like a pretzel. So, sit up straight! Your chair should support your back, and your feet should be flat on the ground. Seriously, no dangling legs like a kid on a swing!

Now, let‚Äôs talk about positioning. Place the keyboard at elbow height. This is crucial! If your elbows are too high or too low, it‚Äôs like trying to play the piano with a banana. Not ideal. Your wrists should hover just above the keys, not resting on the desk or the keyboard itself. This can help prevent that annoying wrist pain that creeps up like a ninja when you least expect it.

And here‚Äôs a trick I learned: tilt the keyboard slightly. It‚Äôs like giving it a little pep talk! A slight angle can help keep your wrists in a more natural position. If you‚Äôre feeling fancy, consider using a wrist rest. It‚Äôs like a cozy pillow for your hands.

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget to take breaks! Seriously, your fingers will thank you. Stand up, stretch, and shake it out. A few minutes away from typing can make a world of difference. Happy typing!

## The Feel-Good Factor

Typing on a traditional keyboard can feel like trying to write a novel while balancing on a seesaw‚Äîuncomfortable and wobbly. But when I switched to an ergonomic keyboard, it was like stepping onto solid ground. The difference in feel was immediate and striking. Instead of my fingers dancing awkwardly on flat keys, they now glide effortlessly across gently curved surfaces, as if they were gliding on a smooth lake instead of a rocky road.

I used to think wrist pain was just a part of life, like taxes or that weird itch you get in the middle of a meeting. But ever since I made the switch, my wrists have felt like they‚Äôve been on a relaxing vacation. The natural angle of the keys encourages a more relaxed posture, which means I‚Äôm not hunched over like a question mark anymore. It‚Äôs like my hands found their happy place, and they‚Äôre throwing a little celebration every time I type.

Imagine typing for hours without the nagging discomfort creeping in, like a pesky fly buzzing around your head. Now, instead, I feel the joy of creating without the pain. It's a game changer, and honestly, my hands deserve this kind of pampering after all the typing they've done. So, if you‚Äôre tired of that old keyboard giving you the cold shoulder, maybe it‚Äôs time for a little upgrade!

## But What About My Fingers?

Switching to an ergonomic keyboard can feel like trying to ride a unicycle while juggling flaming torches‚Äîexciting but a bit scary. I remember when I first got mine, my fingers felt like they were on a rollercoaster ride, twisting and turning in ways they weren‚Äôt used to. The layout was different, and my muscle memory was all out of whack. At first, I thought, ‚ÄúAm I typing or performing some weird dance?‚Äù 

The biggest concern I had was definitely the learning curve. It took a few days for my fingers to adjust to the new positions. I mean, I was used to typing like a wild octopus on a regular keyboard! I found myself hitting the wrong keys more often than not. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîafter about a week, my fingers started to find their groove. It was like they were finally saying, ‚ÄúHey, this isn‚Äôt so bad!‚Äù

For anyone new to this experience, here are a few tips that helped me ease into the transition:

* **Practice Slowly:** Take your time. Typing games can make practice fun and less frustrating.
* **Stay Patient:** It‚Äôs okay to feel awkward at first. Give yourself grace; it‚Äôs a new skill!
* **Frequent Breaks:** Give your fingers a rest. It‚Äôs amazing how a little break can help you reset.

Before I knew it, my fingers were dancing across the keys, and I was typing faster than ever‚Äîwithout the usual wrist pain!

## The Adesso: A Long-Term Investment

When I first laid my hands on the ergonomic keyboard, I thought, ‚ÄúThis better not be one of those fads.‚Äù You know, the kind where you buy something thinking it‚Äôll change your life, only to have it gather dust in the corner like that treadmill you promised you‚Äôd use. But let me tell you, this keyboard is a true gem. It‚Äôs not just about comfort; it‚Äôs about durability too. 

I‚Äôve been using it for a while now, and it feels like it‚Äôs built to last. The keys are still as responsive as they were on day one. No sticking, no weird noises‚Äîjust smooth sailing. I remember when I spilled coffee on it (yes, I‚Äôm that person), and I panicked. But after a quick wipe down, it was back in action like nothing happened! If that‚Äôs not a testament to longevity, I don‚Äôt know what is.

Over time, I‚Äôve tweaked my setup a bit. I added a cushioned wrist rest, which was a game-changer. It‚Äôs like giving your wrists a cozy blanket while they work. I truly believe investing in this keyboard is investing in your health and productivity. It‚Äôs not just a tool; it‚Äôs a long-term companion that keeps your hands happy. And let‚Äôs face it‚Äîhappy hands mean a happy life!

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it - my love letter to the Adesso ergonomic keyboard. If you're ready to bid farewell to wrist pain and hello to happy hands, give this keyboard a try. Trust me, your fingers will thank you! And remember, every journey begins with a single keystroke. Happy typing!",1,1732989216.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

When my classmates post their political views on social media, I mostly disagree with them.

When my classmates rave about the typical post-MBA careers they're pursuing, I disagree with them.

When classmates give predictions on the stock market or economy, I often have a different analysis.

When classmates talk about the ""cool"" new album releases of artists, when I listen to them, I often think they're mediocre.

When classmates give their take on on the best food, restaurants, bars, or coffee shops in the area, I often disagree.

When classmates talk about the best travel destinations, I often do not agree. Same with the activities they enjoy doing there.

When classmates talk about how awesome the new iPhone is, I disagree as Android has been superior for years.

But I usually keep quiet. Because there is a pressure to conform on campus. There is a pressure to just smile and nod at whatever others say so that you're seen as ""likable"" and people will be happy referring you to jobs down the line.

There area few open non conformists, and things haven't gone well socially for them. They're pretty unpopular. So the consequences of breaking from the mold are there.

But, I personally have a lot of respect for the people who are authentically themselves. One person got flacked for saying ""Wicked"" sucked but I agree with them but am too afraid to express my open when others ask.

The people who are unafraid to be themselves despite the social consequences are the ones deserving of respect, not the typical conformist MBA. Which includes me. I'm to much of a wimp to be ""my real self.""",0,1732988666.0,MBA,6,0.21,False

So when I wake up I will not expect a clean kitchen, and I will not get upset because I was already informed of the situation. *(Certainty is the perfect antidote for someone with CPTSD)*  Him admitting he forgot and telling me, makes me feel supported and heard. It's a great compromise when it's a bad time to start cleaning *(like in the middle of the night or before his morning coffee or when we are going somewhere)*  

If he hasn't told me. I can also ask him when I wake up in the morning or before going to bed *""Hey Honey. What is the current situation in the kitchen? Should I expect a panic attack tomorrow morning?"" (in a loving humorous tone)* 

Sometimes he can go:  *""OK so I have done X and Y but there's some Z left because a b c""* 

and I instantly know what to expect. I choose to focus on him have done X and Y and  am grateful and thank him *(we always thank eachother for our efforts, chores are heavy for both of us)*  and don't mind that little Z. It comes down to picking my battles. Criticism on every minor missed Z is not a happy situation for anyone. I hope this can give some inspiration for other dx relationships.

1h3hpd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1h3hpd9/week_4_starting_to_get_better/,Week 4 - Starting to Get Better,"Hey Guys,

I've decided to make a post about Prozac‚Äîa little backstory. I developed a recent GAD. I was on Venlafaxine for the longest time until I didn't need it anymore. I've been on 45 mg of Mirtazapine for the longest time, and it has been a lifesaver in terms of sleep. I was working on my depression for the longest time and was getting better. The Venlafaxine numbed me, so I was not aware of that baggage in my closet until after I stopped this medication. Anyway, I developed a GAD after overdosing on caffeine. My anxiety continued and got worse after changing to a different shift at work. I got prescribed Venlafaxine again. It was a big mistake. I made my HR in the 150, and my anxiety went through the roof with chest pain. I had to go to the ER to get Xanax to chill me out. I stopped the Venlafaxine. A few months prior, I was taking Cymbalta, but it didn't cause me to have high anxiety but gave me brain fog to the point I couldn't function. Cymbalta did help with my depression and anxiety, but I couldn't stay on it since I was displaying symptoms of mania. My psychiatrist gave me 20 mg of Prozac, and it is finally starting to work, but it has been a rollercoaster ride. 

Week 1: High anxiety, chest pain, hyperfocused on my breathing; I think it was mainly from starting new medications and having bad experiences. I was using Hydroxazine to help get me through this and preferred it over Clamazepam since I don't like feeling impaired. 

Week 2: I saw my psychiatrist at the beginning of that week and decided to stick with the 20 mg Prozac. No anxiety, but feeling like crap from lack of sleep that started a few days after seeing my psychiatrist. Nothing helped with sleep, no matter what I took. Clonazepam, Melatonin, Hydroxazine, nothing helped with sleep. My work suffered from it. But no anxiety was a big plus. The lack of sleep was killing me for a while there. No appetite started around this time. I had less chest pain, and I still focused on my breathing.

Week 3: High anxiety but still able to do my job and still no appetite. I decided to take some time off work at the end of this week to get my act together. Diarrhea from lack of food intake. I was on protein shakes there, so I had something. My HR was elevated as well when I woke up. However, it got better as my day went on. I knew I wasn't dying, and it was just anxiety, so I just pushed through it. I stopped taking any Hydroxyzine or Clonazepam since I felt like crap the following day and still had anxiety. I was less focused on my breathing, but I felt an elevated heart rate. 

Week 4: I still have some anxiety, but I'm starting to feel better. The rapid HR slowed down a lot to the point I barely noticed. Around day 29, I began to feel almost normal. However, I felt very agitated. I work in a high-stress environment that, at times, can be violent. That passed the day afterward, and I'm slowly feeling better. Day 33, and I woke up with some morning anxiety. However, this stopped after I took my Prozac this morning. I've been sleeping more than I did in any of the previous weeks, and I've been craving caffeine. I've had to reduce my caffeine intake due to the anxiety and lack of sleep. I keep thinking my HR is elevated, but every time I check, my HR is well below the 100's. It's elevated whenever I wake up but subsides after I drink water and take my Prozac, so I think it's more dehydration-related. 

I'm still off work for a few weeks, but I look forward to returning. The anxiety is much more manageable, and the depression has gotten better. I'm in between sticking with 20 mg of Prozac for the next few weeks or increasing the dosage. I'm pretty sure I'm sensitive to medications. I already went through hell the first few weeks at 20 mg, and I don't want to do it again at 40 mg. However, I see the benefit of this medication at the current dosage. I haven't required any Hydroxyzine or Clonazepam, and I'm able to calm myself down after a while with the anxiety. I've been told that Weeks 4-6 is when you start feeling the benefits, and I am feeling it. I figured I'd share my journey with you guys. This medication does work, but it wasn't an easy road. I was at the point of considering Medical Cannabis instead of Prozac, but I'm glad I didn't and decided just to let the Prozac settle in. I'm still taking it easy on my caffeine intake, but man, I am craving energy drinks now, which is good since that's how I was before becoming anxious. However, I'm sticking with Coffee and Tea from now on. I'm curious to see what you guys think. The posts I've read here helped me a lot through the first few weeks cause I thought I was never going to get better. 

  
Side-Note: I saw a cardiologist for my elevated HR/chest pain, and everything was normal besides mild Aortic Valve Regurgitation. It was all Psych-related. I hardly get any chest pain now after 3 weeks of the Prozac.",2,1732988004.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

Some background information about her and our financies

My wife (30 F) has Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) with Insulin resistance. Aside from this our doctor says her bloodwork looks normal. Due to her PCOS not being undercontrol her body is storing a lot of fat in her midsection, she really doesn't eat very much during meals and doesn't lose much weight on calorie deficit. 

Our finances: We own our home. When we bought it it was a fixer upper. The realtor said it was move in ready but after a few months of living there we found more and more problems. The roof was pouring water into our second floor during storms. The windows were so old and wouldn't shut completely anymore and blew in frequently. The central air and furnace were 20 years old. We have taken out loans to fix all these issues. We had two cars when we met but my engine blew up and we had to junk my car. Her car was totaled in an accident forcing us to purchase a newer car with a loan from our credit union. I have student loans. We currently have zero credit card debt. 

Situation: We both want to conceive a baby and have our debt get payed off. I used to be 260lbs and switched to eating exclusively at home and closing to eat things that have no added sugars or excess fat in them. I'm down to 165lbs. I also exercise every single day. My wife basically does the exact opposite of me. She gets starbucks everyday, she gets fast food on her way to work everyday, she doesn't exercise, and when she is home she is constantly wanting to sleep. The only thing she does aside from sleep is play mario party with me. The constant fast food and coffees are significantly more expensive than making food and coffee at home and significantly less ingridents that are horrible for her PCOS. The doctor told us what she eats is messing with her hormones and causing infertility. When I am home I know what she does and doesn't like to eat. She doesn't like eggs or most breakfast meats so when I am home I try to make her protein pancakes and get her fairlife whole milk for as much protein as possible. I can't do this everyday however.

I've had conversations with her about all of this and how we have goals we both want to meet someday and it feels like it's in one ear and out the other almost like she zones out the second I start trying to talk to her about it. It hurts my feelings and makes me feel like she doesn't care about our fertility or finances.

* Leaving your phone unlocked in public spaces.
* Using weak or no password at all.
* Not enabling remote tracking services.

**Prevention tips**

* Use strong passwords or biometric locks like face recognition or figure prints scanning.
* Enable remote wipe and tracking features, for example, Find My iPhone or Find My Device or Android.
* Never leave your phone unattended in public.

**Mobile security tips**

As mobile phones become more advanced, so do the techniques hackers use to exploit them.

* Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
* Keep your software up to date.
* Install trusted security apps for Android and iPhone.
* Be cautious when using public wi-fi and Bluetooth connections.

1h3hhnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1h3hhnx/chicago_hilton_staffing_problems/,Chicago Hilton Staffing Problems?,"We decided to stay at the Chicago Hilton (720 S Michigan Ave) for Thanksgiving this year. We have fond memories of our Thanksgiving stay here in 2022; they had plenty of staff, lots of holiday decorations, all of the guests were happy and the Thanksgiving brunch was incredible! We were a super happy family and really feeling the holiday spirit that year.

This year has been the exact opposite experience. Aside from registration desk, Hilton Honors sales reps, and the pool staff, almost every other member of the staff seems overworked, underpaid, and completely unsupported. It‚Äôs pretty depressing.

Multiple mornings in a row, we waited for over 45 minutes just to get coffee in our cups at either of the two restaurants (if they were even open). We paid extra for the breakfast package and the breakfast place was open half of the time. Everywhere that there could have been an opportunity to make our stay more pleasant, there seemed to be a manager without the necessary support staff who was running the show all my themselves.

We were looking forward to the brunch this year because of the absolutely amazing spread we were treated to the last time. This year was a completely disappointment. There was no buffet, no resplendent display of sweets or charcuteries or appetizers, and nobody to bring us festive beverages or shave off freshly roasted meats. Instead we were served a plate of canned turkey, on top of boxed stuffing, covered in a tasteless gravy. The dessert was no better. The only good thing about the meal was the butternut squash soup. None of us could feel anything but pity for the manager who had to take orders, bartend, serve food, and bus tables all by himself.

Honestly, the staff who were present did their best to make our stay as enjoyable as possible, but they needed about three times the number of staff in every area of the hotel in order to keep up with even our most basic needs.

What happened, Hilton? I am saddened and embarrassed for advocating our family stay here for the holiday.",1,1732987431.0,Hilton,2,1.0,False

Is there a more efficient way? I personally don't like it because the screen size of the handheld POS to me limits how fast orders can be taken as opposed to a tablet/swiveling tablet.

Myself (34M) went on a first date with (28M) after talking for a number of weeks (work and travelling got in the way). We met up, had coffee and lunch, took a walk around a Christmas Market and went our separate ways 3 hours later as we both had other commitments. Overall a great time, a peck on the cheek each and we both said we'd like to do it again.

A little later I notice he's disappeared from the platform we met on which I thought might be a good sign. But he was still messaging me directly on WhatsApp. However, a friend informed me he's still on the platform (I shared his profile for safety)... so he's blocked me.

I haven't addressed it with him yet as I can't think of a way to bring it up which doesn't sound like I'm taking an unhealthy interest but

A) is this a red flag to you?
B) what are some explanations?

Advice?,"I am living at home at the moment due to doing post graduate study, due to costs etcetera. To basically summarise, I have dealt with my father swearing and verbally abusing me growing up. Strained relationship with my brother. My mother cheated on my father years ago and I found out but did not say anything for years as I did not want to hurt either of them or break up their marriage, when I was young. My father continues to occasionally verbally abuse me, and it has reached a boiling point recently.

I have also been dealing with chronic pain and my GP was quite apathetic and almost snide with my last visit. Argued with me about a medication dosage and said the dosage I was saying was wrong, did not put her pen down when I was talking to her as I feel my pain has not been addressed lately, along with abnormal bloods. My mother blamed it on the fact that I called my GP by her first name, basically blaming me. Something came up about how I did not get any relief from physio appointments. My mother then had the audacity to claim that I wasn't doing my exercises because she didn't see me do them (make that make sense - they were something I did laying in bed at night, neck strengthening). I had done them, in my room privately - also quite insulting given the fact that I just take general exercise and fitness so seriously too. I had told my mum a few weeks ago, a few years ago I had been sexually assaulted by a date and she did not show an inch of empathy.

Anyway, I just reached a boiling point the other day and told my mother and dad what I thought, and told my dad in front of my mother that she had been cheating on him years ago, that I saw the messages, and I knew as a child back then that things were inappropriate and I even myself told her in recent years to cut this man out, so she knows. I had mapped out my life recently and I am absolutely sick of being made out to believe that \*I\* am the issue and that everything is \*my\* fault, like my family have led me to believe. She did not say anything but then for the first time in maybe 15 years showed my dad all this attention and they went out for coffee that day, obviously her going into complete damage control and wanting him to be on her side. I reminded them about the time she punched me in the face and she denied it. I asked today that I want her to admit to the things she has done and to apologise. She won't and refuses to and says that I should apologise to her (\*To her\* - I cannot believe this). As my dad said, 'she is not going to admit to something she has not done' yet her behaviour and conduct screams guilty. I believe she is also psychologically abusing me whereby she is trying to distort my reality and she's said comments that are her attempt to make me feel I've got something wrong with me mentally. I think also partly why she won't admit defeat and what she's done wrong because as my father said 'they love each other' and that he's not going to divorce her. Yet, they have literally gotten into physical fights when drunk before and arguably have had one of the most toxic relationships in history - yet I am supposed to believe this. She does this fake 'apology' thing where she sort of half apologises, because my dad has made her but she does not actually¬†*admit*¬†to anything and apologise - it is not genuine. My mother has always been someone too who needs constant admiration (NPD most likely), she is not educated and does not have a high-powered job, yet my dad has been and unfortunately I think the reason why they did not get a divorce or why she didn't push for one was due to money, and I've said that to them.

1h3h92w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h3h92w/my_mother_60f_refuses_to_admit_and_apologise_to/,My mother (60F) refuses to admit and apologise to cheating on my father and abusing me (28F)? Advice?,"I am living at home at the moment due to doing post graduate study (meaning I have a bachelors plus doing this post grad degree), due to costs etcetera. To basically summarise, I have dealt with my father swearing and verbally abusing me growing up. Strained relationship with my brother. My mother cheated on my father years ago and I found out but did not say anything for years as I did not want to hurt either of them or break up their marriage, when I was young. My father continues to occasionally verbally abuse me, and it has reached a boiling point recently.

I have also been dealing with chronic pain and my GP was quite apathetic and almost snide with my last visit. Argued with me about a medication dosage and said the dosage I was saying was wrong, did not put her pen down when I was talking to her as I feel my pain has not been addressed lately, along with abnormal bloods. My mother blamed it on the fact that I called my GP by her first name, basically blaming me. Something came up about how I did not get any relief from physio appointments. My mother then had the audacity to claim that I wasn't doing my exercises because she didn't see me do them (make that make sense - they were something I did laying in bed at night, neck strengthening). I had done them, in my room privately - also quite insulting given the fact that I just take general exercise and fitness so seriously too. I had told my mum a few weeks ago, a few years ago I had been sexually assaulted by a date and she did not show an inch of empathy.

Anyway, I just reached a boiling point the other day and told my mother and dad what I thought, and told my dad in front of my mother that she had been cheating on him years ago, that I saw the messages, and I knew as a child back then that things were inappropriate and I even myself told her in recent years to cut this man out, so she knows. I had mapped out my life recently and I am absolutely sick of being made out to believe that \*I\* am the issue and that everything is \*my\* fault, like my family have led me to believe. She did not say anything but then for the first time in maybe 15 years showed my dad all this attention and they went out for coffee that day, obviously her going into complete damage control and wanting him to be on her side. I reminded them about the time she punched me in the face and she denied it. I asked today that I want her to admit to the things she has done and to apologise. She won't and refuses to and says that I should apologise to her (\*To her\* - I cannot believe this). As my dad said, 'she is not going to admit to something she has not done' yet her behaviour and conduct screams guilty. I believe she is also psychologically abusing me whereby she is trying to distort my reality and she's said comments that are her attempt to make me feel I've got something wrong with me mentally. I think also partly why she won't admit defeat and what she's done wrong because as my father said 'they love each other' and that he's not going to divorce her. Yet, they have literally gotten into physical fights when drunk before and arguably have had one of the most toxic relationships in history - yet I am supposed to believe this. She does this fake 'apology' thing where she sort of half apologises, because my dad has made her but she does not actually *admit* to anything and apologise - it is not genuine. My mother has always been someone too who needs constant admiration (NPD most likely), she is not educated and does not have a high-powered job, yet my dad has been and unfortunately I think the reason why they did not get a divorce or why she didn't push for one was due to money, and I've said that to them.

**\[Warning!: Stress Response Approaching Unacceptable Levels: Attempting To Compensate‚Ä¶\]**

*Damnit! Damnit! DAMNIT!* ‚ÄúDAMN IT!!!‚Äù

***CLANG!!!***

I felt pins and needles all throughout my ankle and leg as I kicked the dumpster next to me. My nerves were a mess as I just kept pacing back and forth outside the club. I came out here to hopefully get some fresh air and clear my head before going on, but I was just getting more and more riled up.

‚ÄúDAMN IT!!!‚Äù

**Not like him‚Ä¶**

*SHUT UP!* ***~~Worthless‚Ä¶~~***

**Never like him‚Ä¶**

*She didn‚Äôt mean-* ***~~Useless‚Ä¶~~***

**You hurt her‚Ä¶**

*I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt-* ***~~Burden‚Ä¶~~***

**She hurt you‚Ä¶**

*No! She- She-* ***~~Worthless‚Ä¶~~***

‚ÄúAAAAARRRGGHHH!!!!‚Äù

***CLANG!!!***

The pain in my foot managed to keep me focused for the moment, but I just‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt calm down. My scar was burning, only hurting more and more every time I reached up to scratch it. My head was pounding and my vision kept blurring at the edges.

**She was right‚Ä¶**

*I know that but-* ***~~Useless‚Ä¶~~***

**You can‚Äôt keep this up forever‚Ä¶**

*I HAVE TO!!!* ***~~Useless‚Ä¶~~***

*Otherwise, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just a‚Ä¶* ***~~Burde-~~***

***Creeeeaaakkk‚Ä¶.***

The sound of the large metal door into the club was the last bit of irritation my mind needed. I reeled around on whoever it was that decided to come out here. Was it ‚ÄòNel? No. I asked her to give me some space. I didn‚Äôt want her on the receiving end of‚Ä¶this‚Ä¶ No. I was probably the weirdos that ran this joint. They were always so damn persistent, so damn ANNOYING! Yes, I‚Äôm a human. Yes, I eat meat. NO, I‚ÄôM NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR WEIRD, DEGENERATE, ‚ÄúEAT ME‚Äù CULT! ***STOP FUCKING ASKING!!!***

‚ÄúI told you guys I‚Äôd play when I‚ÄôM GOOD AND READY-‚Äù

I caught myself, instantly regretting my outburst once I realized who it was. ‚ÄòNel seemed shocked for a moment, but her feathers quickly settled back down. She let out a frustrated whistle before giving me an expectant glare.

‚ÄúExpecting someone else?‚Äù

I gave a rough sigh, massaging my head before returning to my pacing. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here, ‚ÄòNel? I said I needed-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been out here ‚Äògetting some fresh air‚Äô for a **\[half hour\]**, Michael. I wanted to make sure you were alright. Not to mention, the *owner* IS getting impatient‚Ä¶‚Äù

*‚ÄúTch*. Like I care. It‚Äôs not like they do either. **If I wasn‚Äôt here, they‚Äôd just find another human to show off.‚Äù**

‚ÄúMichael‚Ä¶‚Äù

I felt a taloned hand grab onto my shoulder, not enough to hurt, but enough to bring me back. I couldn‚Äôt look at her though, no matter how much I wanted to. My intrusive thoughts were leaking out more and more by the second. Nothing felt real. Memories and conversations from the past mixed in right alongside my actual hearing.

*‚ÄúI love you, my joey.‚Äù ‚ÄúI barely even recognized you!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very kind stranger‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI expect better out of my granddaughter‚Äôs future prospects!‚Äù*

***‚ÄúYOU ARE NOT YOUR FATHER, MICHA-‚Äù***

*‚ÄúACK!!‚Äù* My headache spiked causing me to cradle my face in both my hands.

‚ÄúWoah! Easy! I‚Äôve got you‚Ä¶‚Äù Before I knew it, ‚ÄòNel was supporting me, gently guiding me to the ground. I barely noticed it until I felt the curb beneath me. All I could do was hold my head in my handles as I felt my own panicked heartbeat pulse through it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening to me, ‚ÄòNel?‚Äù

‚ÄúEasy. Just breathe‚Ä¶‚Äù Khornel cooed gently to me. I listened, trying to focus on my breathing and her voice.

*Breathe‚Ä¶focus‚Ä¶* ***~~Worthless‚Ä¶~~***

‚Äú‚ÄòNel, I-‚Äù

‚ÄúMichael. Breathe. Don‚Äôt talk. Just breathe.‚Äù

The blurriness and fuzziness of my vision slowly went away, not completely, never completely, but I could at least see her next to me‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt alone‚Ä¶

*Breathe‚Ä¶focus‚Ä¶* ***~~Useless‚Ä¶~~***

‚Äú‚ÄòNel‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúJust breathe‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her taloned hands wrapped around mine. I focused on it. Slowly, the voices quieted down. The sound of the world around me came back into focus. My breathing slowed. For a moment, even my headache began to get better. I rubbed at my forehead with my free hand, trying to nurse the pain back down. I wanted to scratch at my scar, but my other hand was still being held by ‚ÄòNel. Once I‚Äôd calmed down a bit more, she finally gave me a nod.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

I let out another breath. ‚ÄúA little‚Ä¶‚Äù

Not really, but I was at least coherent for now. But that brought its own problems. For one thing, now instead of just being blindly angry at everything, that anger was now focused on what had just happened.

*Damn it, Ma! Why?! Why would you listen to a scumbag like that?!*

I didn‚Äôt know who this ‚ÄúVenric‚Äù guy was, or what his game was, but he carried himself with the exact same smarmy, superior attitude that always rubbed me the wrong way. He really was just like ***them‚Ä¶*** I might‚Äôve been too young to know everything that happened with the custody hearings that took me away from my dad, but I still had to see those exact same lawyers come back again and again, wondering why these strange men kept showing up at our door, wondering if I‚Äôd done something wrong, wondering‚Ä¶if they were here to take me back to ***her‚Ä¶***

They always had some ‚Äúnew information‚Äù, some ‚Äúnew deal‚Äù for my dad, and it ALWAYS involved money. And at the end, when all I wanted to do was mourn the man I admired more than any other, and listen to the kind words of his friends and others who knew him, they came back AGAIN, even THEN! I barely remember anything that happened that day, but I DID remember the moment they came.

I just remember staring forward, directly at the coffin. I was actually surprised by the number of people who showed. Most of Dad‚Äôs family was still back in Mexico and just‚Ä¶weren‚Äôt in contact. The rest of the people were just people he knew, people he played for, people he played with. So many different people whose lives he touched. Their kind words and stories melted together in my mind as I just kept staring at the coffin directly in front of me. I was only awoken from my daze when a new voice intruded into the mix. I recognized it immediately. I‚Äôd had to listen to that same damn voice over and over when they‚Äôd show up at the door with ‚Äúa new offer.‚Äù All I remembered thinking was ‚ÄúGod, can‚Äôt you just leave us alone for ONCE?! Just ONCE?!‚Äù

These kinds of people are relentless. They never back down, they never admit fault, they never take responsibility, they never take no for an answer, and they just‚Ä¶never‚Ä¶stop‚Ä¶

Winning. Winning and money. That‚Äôs all they care about. And they just‚Ä¶never‚Ä¶stop‚Ä¶

I thought I was finally done dealing with people like that. But now they‚Äôre here, trying to take advantage of my family AGAIN.

*Ma‚Ä¶ Why‚Ä¶?*

‚ÄúMichael?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶why did she do it? Why would she trust those guys, after everything we‚Äôve been through?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lawyers? Well, I‚Äôm not sure about them myself, but I can think of a few reasons‚Ä¶‚Äù

I looked up to ‚ÄòNel, only for her to look away from me in shame. ‚ÄúWe care about you, Michael. Even if this person can‚Äôt be trusted, I can understand why she‚Äôd still want to at least TRY to make things easier for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt matte-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou matter to US, Michael. No matter how much that voice in your head tells you otherwise, you mean more to us than anything. I mean‚Ä¶just look at me‚Ä¶at what I was willing to do just so you could be happy‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her head lowered, and a pit of guilt formed in my gut. Just yesterday, I‚Äôd found out just how much she‚Äôd been putting up with without me noticing. I should‚Äôve been there for her. I should‚Äôve done more. I should‚Äôve acted sooner. And‚Ä¶I shouldn‚Äôt have blown up at her for not telling me. She was just trying to make me happy‚Ä¶ Even now, here she was, sticking by me despite the absolute mess of a state I was in.

*Throughout everything‚Ä¶always right beside me‚Ä¶*

My grip on her hand tightened almost on its own.

‚ÄúWhy are you all always sacrificing so much for me? You shouldn‚Äôt have to. I should be able to-‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt, Michael. Not by yourself. Even if you WEREN‚ÄôT still injured, you can‚Äôt do it all. You‚Äôre only human‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI just...want to do all I can‚Ä¶ I want to keep you all safe‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt lose you guys‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄòNel let out an exhausted whistle, almost laughing. ‚ÄúHonestly Michael, I might be crest over talons for you, but you really are stupid sometimes.‚Äù

My mind flipped on its head from that one statement. I double-taked for a moment before staring at her in a mixture of shock and confusion.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think, after everything we‚Äôve all been through together, if you were going to lose us, it would‚Äôve happened already? We‚Äôre not going anywhere. Not Ms. Teylim. Not Tohba. Not grandfather‚Ä¶‚Äù

She scooted closer before resting her head on my shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd not me either.‚Äù

Her crest lightly brushed against my scar, making me almost absentmindedly lean into her. She just‚Ä¶had this effect on me. She always knew just what to say to help me calm down, keep me grounded. But me? I‚Ä¶never really knew what to say during moments like this. I loved her. Of course, I did. But if anything, that just made things even more complicated. She shouldn‚Äôt have to stick around just for a mess like me. She shouldn‚Äôt have to calm me down whenever I start having a fit. She shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶someone like me. She deserves a partner, not a project. She deserves better‚Ä¶ But like the selfish ass I am, I pulled her into a side hug anyways.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I snapped at you. Not just tonight, but last night, too. You didn‚Äôt deserve that.‚Äù

**She‚Äôs not the only person you snapped at recently‚Ä¶**

*God‚Ä¶ Ma‚Ä¶*

My eyes winced closed as I remembered all the terrible things I said to her. She was just trying to help. She‚Äôs always trying to help. All of them are‚Ä¶and I‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúDo whatever the hell you want,* ***Tey‚Ä¶‚Äù***

*Fuck‚Ä¶ Did I really say that? What the fuck‚Äôs wrong with me?!*

It wasn‚Äôt just that either. I‚Äôd been snapping more and more lately. I snapped at clients, friends, and other random people as well. Just snapping and yelling and screaming at whoever was unlucky enough to piss me off in the slightest. God‚Ä¶I really WAS becoming a lunatic, wasn‚Äôt I?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing it, ‚ÄòNel.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶been so angry. I almost snapped at that one idiot at The Lackadaisy. I ranted at the prick, Azlin until I nearly passed out. I screamed at YOU. And now‚Ä¶Ma‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúH-how much did you hear?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of it‚Ä¶‚Äù

I finally let go of her hand, if only just so I could cradle my head with both of them. The headache returned in full, and the guilt in my gut only got worse.

‚ÄúI snapped at my MOM, ‚ÄòNel. I said so many‚Ä¶ God, what the hell have I done?! Ma‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou made a mistake‚Ä¶‚Äù

I just shook my head, still forcing my eyes closed. I could almost hear a whisper, the voices in my head threatening to come back.

‚ÄúMichael! Look at me!‚Äù The sharpness of ‚ÄòNel‚Äôs talons brought me back to reality as she grabbed onto my shoulder, facing me towards her. Her eyes stared straight into mine, giving me something to focus on.

‚ÄúYou made a mistake. Just like I did. Just like everyone does. So, now what?‚Äù

*I‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶*

I focused. I took a breath, closing my eyes only for a moment. I opened them again, staring right back into her eyes.

*I need to make up for it‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúI need to fix it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. So for now, let‚Äôs just get through this show, and then, we go home, and make things right. Okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Okay‚Ä¶‚Äù

I moved to get up, only to be stopped. ‚ÄúAnd hey.‚Äù

I looked back to her just in time to be pulled into a proper hug, her beak scratching across my scar. The burning soothed, and I almost instinctively hugged back, holding her close.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a bad person, Michael. You just‚Ä¶need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself. You don‚Äôt need to do everything alone. You have us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. Thanks ‚ÄòNel. Sorry I‚Äôm such a‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have you any other way. Now come on.‚Äù

**\[Transcript Time Progression: 15 minutes‚Ä¶\]**

The incoherent cheers and applause from the audience were almost deafening. They only quieted once the lights went down, leaving only the stage lighting. ‚ÄòNel gave me a nod, and I gave her one back.

*Breathe‚Ä¶focus‚Ä¶and* [play‚Ä¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UyOJGr9IDA)

‚ÄòNel hit her pad, and a heavy bass drum began stomping out a steady beat. One measure, then two, and right on the off beat before the third, I strummed Teyrin‚Äôs strings, repeating a steady riff and letting out a hum.

Snares smacked out a build up, the hi-hat and cymbals joining in on the downbeat. My head nodded sharply to the beat. The rhythm flowed through me, only stopping for a moment as the first words left my mouth.

*I can‚Äôt agree to disagree.*

*Fightin‚Äô like I‚Äôm fightin‚Äô for life!*

I let up on Teyrin, letting the bass keep the rhythm. Instead, I focused on my singing.

*They‚Äôre only words but they cut like a blade!*

*Swingin‚Äô wild with all of my might!*

God, I really HAVE been losing it, haven‚Äôt I?

*I guess it‚Äôs all of that coffee,*

*THAT‚ÄôS GOT MY MIND IN A WHIRL!*

*I‚Äôm still a‚Äô cussin‚Äô and bitchin‚Äô,*

*AND THERE AIN‚ÄôT NOBODY HERE!*

Just so angry, all of the time. Tey was right. I haven‚Äôt been myself.

*Oh yeah! You don‚Äôt have to holler! I hear you!*

Brass blasted through the speakers, answering me.

*I‚Äôm standin‚Äô right here beside you!*

*OH! NINETY-NINE SHADES A‚Äô CRAZY!!!!*

*I‚Äôm NINETY-NINE SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

*CRAZY!!! CRAZY!!! CRAZY!!!*

*MMmmmmMMMmmmMMMMMMmmm‚Ä¶*

I lightly strummed Teyrin with short downstrokes alongside another snare build up, leading into the second verse.

*Pour another drink. Make it a double for me.*

*Maybe, I can drink this away!*

With the jet fuel these guys drink? The only thing going away is my life.

*It‚Äôs never fun when they pull out the gun!*

*¬°¬°¬°¬°NOVENTA-NUEVE!!!!* ***¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°TONOS DE LOCOOOOOOOO!!!!!***

*YEAH!!!!*

My scream faded, letting the organ take over with the solo. With every scream, every chorus, every chord, I felt my mind clear. ‚ÄòNel was right. This was exactly what I needed. I needed to get through this show, to get all of this out of me. And then‚Ä¶then I‚Äôd make it right.

For now though, I bounced back and forth, jamming right alongside the organ. It was a shame that it was just a synth. What I would give to play alongside a REAL keyboard master, someone who could do more than just play the notes on a page. Maybe even fix that old flytser back at the old house!

**Like anyone here would want to band up with a human‚Ä¶**

I shook the thought away. It was a nice thought, and I needed as many of those as I could find. Still, it was nice to dream. Dream of possibilities, of things‚Ä¶maybe returning to normal one day‚Ä¶ It would be nice‚Ä¶if maybe‚Ä¶just maybe‚Ä¶we could finally go back‚Ä¶

I turned off the reverb, gently letting Teyrin‚Äôs natural voice ring lightly through the speakers.

*I need some peace‚Ä¶ Just some relief‚Ä¶,*

*From this voice‚Ä¶killin‚Äô me‚Ä¶*

I just want to go home‚Ä¶away from all this‚Ä¶

*You stare at me, and you glare at me‚Ä¶*

*Oooooh! This pain! It‚Äôs all the same!*

*IT‚ÄôS ALL INSANE! YOU SEE!!*

*Is this really happenin‚Äô?!*

*OR DID I MAKE IT ALL UP?!*

*I‚Äôm bound for Chattahoochee,*

*ON A TURNIP TRUCK!!!*

Everything going on right now is just so nuts. None of it made sense. And after everything that‚Äôs happened, all I want to do is just go back to our home and back to our old lives. Was that really so much to ask for?! What the hell did we do?!

*Oh yeah! You don‚Äôt have to holler! I hear you!*

*I‚Äôm standin‚Äô right here beside you!*

*OH! NINETY-NINE SHADES A‚Äô CRAZY!!!!*

*I‚Äôm NINETY-NINE SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

*CRAZY!!! CRAZY!!! CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!*

*Yeah! You‚Äôre crazy!!!*

*OH! YOU CRAZY!!! YEAH! YOU CRAZYYYY!!!*

*OOOHHHH! HOLD MY BLEEDIN‚Äô FEET TO THE FIRE!!!*

*OOHH!! MY FEET INTO THE FIRE!!!*

*I NEVER SAID I WAS DOWN WITH YOU!!!!*

The repeated instrumental of the chorus exploded as all the instruments, the bass, the drums, the brass, and the organ followed along as I twanged out on Teyrin, letting out all my frustrations and anger through the speakers. I was done with all of it. And I wanted this world to know.

*Oh,* ***NINETY-NINE!!!*** *SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

*NI-NI-NI-* ***NINETY-NINE!!!*** *SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

*OH! Nine-Nine-Na-Nine-Na-Nine Nine Nine!!!*

*Nine-Nine-Na-Nine-Na-Nine Nine Nine!!!*

*¬°¬°¬°¬°NOVENTA-NUEVE!!!!* ***¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°TONOS DE LOCO!!!!!***

The crowd, by this point was exploding with cheers and applause as I continued screaming out my own self-diagnosis, screaming it out for anyone to hear.

***NINETY-NINE!!!*** *SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

*I‚Äôm* ***NINETY-NINE!!!*** *SHADES OF CRAZY!!!*

I was crazy. I was completely batshit insane, and my family loved me just fine that way. Still, once this was all done, I‚Äôd make it up to Ma. I had to.

*I‚Äôm coming back, Ma. I‚Äôm sorry I ever left. Just please, wait a little while longer. I have a call to make first.*

To me it‚Äôs so crazy how we can just be mentally entrenched in something because it‚Äôs a comfortable hell, a familiar pain.

My depressive episodes have gotten less frequent and less lengthy‚Ä¶ but they still come. They usually come in my luteal phase of my cycle. At first I claw around aimlessly trying to think of medication or hormonal support or dietary changes or personality shifts I can make in myself.

Then slowly I look around and see how many of my relationships are still stuck in the victim triangle. Like how many women I am the mother too, always putting my **big feelings** on the back burner to not become an inconvenience.

Eventually, the back burner boils over and the seething rage becomes the elixir that snuffs out my fire. Boom. Depressive episode. Wet, damp, heavy like moss. Sleep, baths, crying. Music if I can manage. Band aid coffees and short walks if I can muster.

But I seldom address that core thing. These f***ing relationships and the deep bowl of unworthiness from which they fester.

Lately I‚Äôve been brave, cut off so many people, addressed the dynamic in a few, but then the loneliness sets in, you know?

Anyway. I never talk about this publicly because of course I am the iconic, perfectionist, *has it all together* eldest daughter.

1h3h3ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orthokeratology/comments/1h3h3ii/after_quitting_caffeine_halos_and_glare_are/,After quitting caffeine.. halos and glare are almost gone. ,"I've been using Ortho-K since April, so that's nearly 8 months now. I loved everything about it, except for the glare and halos once it starts getting dark. At first they were really noticeable on screens and TV, but after a couple of months, that stopped being an issue. The only real problem was night driving - massive circles around every street lamp, brake lights, and traffic signals made seeing really difficult.

My optician checked my eyes when it happened, noting the pupil dilation. There wasn't much to be done, but I figured it was worth the trade-off.

Two days ago, I had to drive home as it was getting dark - something I'd been dreading. But to my surprise, everything looked... normal. Which was fucking weird, as I hadn't seen this well at night since before Ortho-K. I'd been avoiding night driving for months because of those halos.

Then I realised something: I'd been caffeine-free for about a week. A few months ago, I was on 4 coffees a day. Three months back, I cut down to 3, and slowly reduced until now I'm on none.

I've been out twice since that drive, and while the halos are still there, they're maybe a fifth of what they used to be. I can see a lot better. Weirdly, I'd never made this connection before and my optometrist hadn't mentioned it either.

From my sciencey background, two interesting things stand out:

1. Caffeine directly dilates pupils by blocking adenosine release - simple enough.

2. Stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol dilate pupils too - it's an autonomic response for spotting out threats. I wasn't chronically stressed, but I definitely feel more relaxed, at peace without caffeine, things that would stress me in daily life certainly do so less. 

For anyone using Ortho-K: if you're a caffeine drinker, maybe try reducing your intake. During withdrawal (days 0-9), don't expect instant changes. Your body and brain chemistry need time to adjust.

Who'd have thought caffeine could mess with your night vision like this?‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",2,1732986389.0,Orthokeratology,0,1.0,False

First time, I finally felt so free and normal! Then 6 months later it cames back with a vengeance, this time excessive super eggy farting ALLLL the time. Stopped immediately after getting back on antibiotics.

Then, recently this past July I noticed I was bloated all the time - and whatever bloat or weight gain I got during peek period time never went away. It only did when I took a laxative in conjunction with Linzess I was already one. I‚Äôm talking like normal weight range for over a year being 141-143 then suddenly spiked to close to 147 and now no matter what I do will not budge.

My eating habits have not changed in that timeframe, I eat most clean foods. I‚Äôm talking black coffee for breakfast (not hungry in the am), salad with chicken, peppers, cucumbers, and mushrooms with no dressing for lunch OR a protein shake. Dinner is usually a protein (chicken or steak) with a side of spinach or veggie like brusselsprouts. Occasionally get takeout, but generally keep it on the healthier side. Like Egg Fo Yung etc..

I‚Äôve gone low FODMAP, and moved more to Keto/Carnivore and I workout 4-7 days a week, either by walking + cardio/strength or an extended walk/run depending on the day and energy‚Ä¶

I figured might be a SIBO flare, but after this recent round of antibiotics I‚Äôve seen no change. Occasionally my weight will suddenly drop to 144-145 and I start to feel normal, but then like 2 days later it‚Äôs up to almost 150 with me still majnothe above.

I‚Äôm about to contact to my GI for another breath test, but has anyone else had this experience before? I feel like I‚Äôm running myself ragged trying to feel better and just nothing is working.

1h3guz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/uknews/comments/1h3guz4/antisemitism_at_the_bbc_now_normal_after_oct_7/,"Anti-Semitism at the BBC now ‚Äònormal‚Äô after Oct 7, whistleblower claims","An experienced Jewish staff member alleges they endure ‚ÄòIsrael bashing‚Äô on a near-daily basis and have their concerns dismissed by managers

A whistleblower has said anti-Semitism at the BBC has become ‚Äúnormalised‚Äù and accused the broadcaster of failing to take seriously repeated claims of anti-Semitic behaviour and attitudes within the organisation.

The experienced member of staff, who is Jewish, said they had been forced to endure anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli comments on a near-daily basis, only for their concerns to be dismissed by managers.

Writing anonymously for The Telegraph, they said: ‚ÄúAnti-Semitism exists in the newsrooms of Britain‚Äôs public service broadcaster. It has done for years, and it is alive and well today, refuelled by the events of Oct 7 and after.

‚ÄúI have experienced it first hand, too much, in my career at the corporation, both before and since the Hamas attacks.‚Äù

Their claims come after Jay Rayner, who last week resigned as The Observer‚Äôs restaurant critic, accused its sister title The Guardian of employing anti-Semites and its editor of lacking the courage to take them on.

The Guardian said it took the allegations seriously and had a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism.

Referring to the paper‚Äôs response, the whistleblower said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard those kinds of platitudes before, namely from my own employer, the BBC.‚Äù

They also accuse Tim Davie, the BBC‚Äôs director general, of failing to get a grip on the problem of anti-Semitism within the corporation, despite his emailing all staff in February to say there was no place for racist abuse of any kind within the BBC.

The whistleblower, who has asked for their identity not to be revealed for fear of being ‚Äúmarked out‚Äù, writes: ‚ÄúFor Jewish staff, the experience of anti-Semitism and Israel bashing is a daily one and Tim Davies‚Äôs statement rings hollow. Actions speak louder than words, and sadly when it comes to anti-Semitism or anti-Zionism at the BBC, its actions practically are mute.‚Äù

The whistleblower, who has worked at the BBC for a number of years, said the problem had grown worse since the conflict in Gaza following Hamas‚Äôs Oct 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 Jews were killed and 251 people were taken hostage.

The BBC staffer said: ‚ÄúThere have been multiple cases of staff comfortably expressing odious views about Zionists, Israel, genocide and Jews on social media, happily with their names on public display. Some have been mentioned in the media, many more have not been publicised and are currently being investigated by HR.‚Äù

The Telegraph has previously reported that BBC presenters and correspondents have been accused of posting ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-Israel‚Äù content about the Gaza conflict on social media.

In September, Danny Cohen, the BBC‚Äôs director of television from 2013 to 2015, published a report claiming the corporation‚Äôs ‚Äúinstitutionally hostile‚Äù coverage of Israel has made Britain unsafe for Jews.

The whistleblower said anti-Israel attitudes ‚Äì which many argue are a cover for anti-Semitic views ‚Äì appeared to be widespread within the BBC even before the Oct 7 attacks.

They said: ‚ÄúDuring a particularly bad spate of terrorist attacks in Israel, a colleague ‚Äì who knew I was Jewish and Zionist ‚Äì gleefully said to me: ‚ÄòMark my words, this will be the beginning of the end of Israel.‚Äô

‚ÄúOn another occasion, I overheard a senior reporter tell an editor: ‚ÄòIsrael is an apartheid state. It‚Äôs a fact‚Äô. . . Israel, of course, is no such thing, and as a Jew to hear it said with conviction at such a level of seniority is deeply offensive, stomach-churning.‚Äù

‚ÄòDeeply concerned‚Äô

More than 200 Jewish employees across the organisation co-signed a letter to the BBC board in August expressing ‚Äúvery serious concerns about anti-Jewish racism‚Äù at the corporation, along with evidential documentation.

Dr Samir Shah, the BBC chair, responded by accepting that ‚Äúon a small number of occasions, staff conduct has fallen below expectations,‚Äù but dismissed the signatories‚Äô call for a formal investigation.

A BBC spokesman said: ‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned to read this article about the experiences of a member of staff; it‚Äôs unacceptable that anyone should face this in their workplace. We deplore anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination or harassment.

‚ÄúWe urge the writer to discuss this with their manager, or if they feel unable to do so, to contact our confidential bullying and harassment helpline or use our whistleblowing service so that these issues can be investigated and addressed, and the staff member can receive the appropriate support.‚Äù

‚ÄòAnti-Semitism is alive and well today‚Äô

By a BBC whistleblower

Like many other Jewish people in the media in this country, I read with dismay about the resignation of restaurant critic Jay Rayner from Guardian newspapers because of what he said were anti-Semitic staff.

I also read with a sense of tedium the Guardian‚Äôs boilerplate response: ‚ÄúWe take allegations of this nature extremely seriously‚Ä¶ \[we have\] a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism‚Ä¶‚Äù

I‚Äôve heard those kinds of platitudes before, namely from my own employer, the BBC. The fact of the matter is: Rayner‚Äôs experience is not unique to the Guardian.

Anti-Semitism exists in the newsrooms of Britain‚Äôs public service broadcaster. It has done for years, and it is alive and well today, refuelled by the events of Oct 7 and after.

I have experienced it first hand, too much, in my career at the corporation, both before and since the Hamas attacks. Here are some examples of what I personally encountered in what can be considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times pre-Oct 7.

During a particularly bad spate of terrorist attacks in Israel, a colleague ‚Äì who knew I was Jewish and Zionist ‚Äì gleefully said to me: ‚ÄúMark my words, this will be the beginning of the end of Israel.‚Äù

On another occasion, I overheard a senior reporter tell an editor: ‚ÄúIsrael is an apartheid state. It‚Äôs a fact.‚Äù The editor accepted the statement without so much as a raised eyebrow. Israel, of course, is no such thing, and as a Jew to hear it said with conviction at such a level of seniority is deeply offensive, stomach-churning. Could I have said something? Possibly ‚Äì but I did not want to mark myself out.

When the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, wrote a letter in The Times warning about the perils to Britain‚Äôs Jewish community of the then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, I witnessed a news producer turn to another and declare openly: ‚ÄúThe chief rabbi is a pal of Boris. It‚Äôs all part of a plot to smear Corbyn,‚Äù like he could have been talking about the weather. The other person reacted to this anti-Semitic conspiracy theory with a blas√© ‚Äúmmm‚Äù.

On another occasion, a colleague mentioned that they were going on a reporting trip to Israel, to which another, sat on the same group of desks as me, replied: ‚ÄúYou mean Palestine.‚Äù The first colleague just laughed. ‚ÄúYou mean Palestine‚Äù is said only by those who reject the existence of the Jewish state. Everybody knew I was Jewish but no one cared, even though that kind of statement means erasing my identity. How have we reached a point where someone felt so relaxed at the BBC as to feel able to make an anti-Semitic political point out loud?

On yet another occasion, while at the coffee station with a journalist, they felt the need to say to my face: ‚ÄúMy sympathies lie with the Palestinians.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even recall having a discussion leading up to it but it was in effect throwing down a gauntlet, a kind of squaring up to a Jew in the office as if to say: ‚ÄúIsrael is simply wrong and I feel so strongly about it that I‚Äôm letting you know.‚Äù Would anyone say to an Indian colleague: ‚ÄúMy sympathies lie with Pakistan,‚Äù or vice-versa? Of course not, it would be unthinkable.

These are just some of the incidents that have happened to me directly ‚Äì and all these occurred before Oct 7. I am not even including the severest examples here, because to do so could risk identifying myself.

This may not seem much to ordinary readers, who might consider such remarks as normal office banter, but if you take just the examples given here and imagine if each case was offensive to black people, or Muslims, or gay people, or women‚Ä¶ well, suddenly, it takes on a different feel. And the harshest thing about these kinds of comments? It‚Äôs the fact that none provoked any reaction other than indifference. No ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äù, nor ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the right thing to say in front of a Jewish person‚Äù. Not even awkward embarrassment. Nope. Nothing. Because at the BBC, these kinds of expressions have become normalised.

So, one might argue: ‚ÄúBut these are just individuals, it‚Äôs not collective.‚Äù Indeed ‚Äì but now take what has happened since Oct 7. There have been multiple cases of staff comfortably expressing odious views about Zionists, Israel, genocide and Jews on social media, happily with their names on public display.

Some have been mentioned in the media, many more have not been publicised and are currently being investigated by HR. Of course, the BBC, with its own template response, will say it takes all such cases seriously and has robust procedures for dealing with this kind of misconduct.

It is true that, in February of this year, after an employee wrote horrific anti-Semitic posts on Facebook before being sacked, Tim Davie, the director general, issued an all-staff email declaring: ‚ÄúSadly in recent weeks we have been alerted to some anti-Semitic behaviour by people who worked with us. I want to be clear that there can be no place at the BBC for racist abuse of any kind, whether towards our Jewish colleagues or indeed colleagues from any background or belief. Any form of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or racist abuse is abhorrent, and we will always act whenever it occurs.‚Äù

But then why is an on-screen presenter who was twice investigated (the BBC never discloses whether a complaint has even been upheld against an individual, let alone what kind of sanction it might have decided was appropriate) for posting streams of anti-Israel ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and comments, including an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, still on air as if nothing ever happened? And why is the piece of analysis on the Israel-Palestinian conflict written by a then BBC Academy lecturer who was found to have just a month later endorsed a post that declared, ‚ÄúThe IDF should not exist. The state of Israel should not exist‚Äù still online, as if it is an impartial, informative piece of proper journalism? And why is the BBC not in the least bit bothered that a member of staff who works for the BBC‚Äôs charity arm, which includes Children in Need and Red Nose Day, lamenting on an all-staff communications network that a Palestinian man had allegedly died ‚Äúin the hands of Zionist Israeli soldiers‚Äù in ‚Äúthis genocide‚Äù?

To regain the confidence of Jewish employees, a start would be for the BBC board to issue a clear directive to staff that using the term Zionist negatively in the workplace is unacceptable ‚Äì but that would risk uproar. Instead, the BBC‚Äôs response to this grotesque display of anti-Semitism was: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think a single deleted post on an internal messaging tool made by one person in an organisation of over 17,000 people usefully demonstrates anything about the BBC, except that we require everyone to follow the mandatory standards in our code of conduct.‚Äù

What that PR line did not reveal was that this post had actually remained there for four days, had been liked by four other members of staff, and had been viewed by more than 3,000 others ‚Äì not one of whom objected or raised a complaint. It was only removed after it was noticed by a Jewish member of staff. Three thousand out of 17,000 staff suddenly tip the scales.

What it did reveal though is that the BBC does not have zero tolerance for anti-Semitism. It has more of a lackadaisical policy, otherwise in each of these cases the offenders would have been fired.

Just this summer, over 200 Jewish employees across the BBC co-signed a letter to the board expressing ‚Äúvery serious concerns about anti-Jewish racism‚Äù at the corporation, along with evidential documentation. The response of Dr Samir Shah, the BBC chair, was to accept that ‚Äúon a small number of occasions, staff conduct has fallen below expectations,‚Äù but dismissed the signatories‚Äô call for a formal investigation. In other words, nothing to see here, you‚Äôre overreacting.

For Jewish staff, the experience of anti-Semitism and Israel bashing is a daily one and Tim Davies‚Äôs statement rings hollow. Actions speak louder than words, and sadly when it comes to anti-Semitism or anti-Zionism at the BBC, its actions practically are mute.

I recently upgraded to a DF54 grinder, having previously used the built-in grinder of the Breville Barista Pro. My workflow was:
	1.	Slight water spritz before grinding.
	2.	Grinding 19.5g of coffee at a ‚Äú10‚Äù fineness setting on the Breville grinder.
	3.	De-clumping the grounds in the dosing cup, transferring them to the bottomless portafilter.
	4.	Using a WDT tool, leveling the surface, and placing a puck screen on top before pulling the shot.

With this process, the shots were consistent, and I never experienced channeling or spraying.

Now with the DF54, I‚Äôve been experimenting with the grind size:
	‚Ä¢	At 20, the shot starts very slowly and it sprayed all over, so I assume it‚Äôs too fine.
	‚Ä¢	At 30, it pulls way too fast and sprays everywhere.

What might I be doing wrong? How can I adjust my workflow or settings to get consistent results with the DF54?

I‚Äôm currently going through a very tough situation and feel stuck and lost. My partner broke up with me about a week ago, 3 weeks after we got two kittens and 1 week after we moved into our new apartment (before that, we lived in a very small apartment together, where we didn't have enough space individually). Our relationship had a lot of high ups and low downs, especially due to different communication styles and emotional challenges that built up over time. I acknowledge that I have emotional and communicative patterns (e.g., me getting hurt and defensive and relating my feelings to his when he's being critical, which makes him feel like he doesn't get enough space) and an anxious attachment (e.g., not leaving him or myself the space that we needed) that were problematic. In the last 2 months, I‚Äôve done a lot of work on myself (e.g., started therapy and made some changes in my life) because I realized that I have to take responsibility and own my role in the relationship. I think we just didn‚Äôt have enough space and time to grow as individuals while still being in the relationship, especially because we moved forward pretty quickly (e.g., moving in after 3 months) and spent almost all of our time together, including conflicts and their resolution (or lack thereof). I also see that I was/am dependent on him and that I didn't give him the space he needed to talk about his feelings, or even process them himself. Additionally, sometimes when I'm emotional and overwhelmed, I subconsciously get louder, interrupt him, and gesticulate. I don't do this intentionally or in order to dominate him or the conversation but because regulating my emotions isn't easy for me sometimes. He told me that he isn't able to deal with that due to his childhood trauma (violent father) and I fully understand that. Overtime, I was mostly able to change these behavioral patterns (they became less frequent, with the last incident being over a month ago). A few weeks prior to moving into our apartment, he told me that he wasn't sure about our longevity, but ultimately decided to still go through with it because he had trust we can work it out. However, after a conflict a few days after we moved into our new apartment, where I blamed him for something that wasn't intentional or his fault, everything changed. He said that he doesn't feel seen in the relationship and feels like he doesn't have the emotional capacity anymore and that he needs time and space to think about whether he ends it. 

For the following week, we talked everyday, with some communication problems showing up again. However, at the end, I was reasonable to everything he said and he also said that now I understand what he wanted but that it's too late. He said he loves me deeply (and I believe him), but can't go further emotionally, also because he feels alienated and doesn't know how sustainable these changes would be. At this point, I had also written him a long letter, explaining what I reflected on and learned over the past weeks, which I read to him a day after we broke up. He said he was surprised because he didn't expect this level of reason and reflection but that it doesn't change his decision. He also told me that he's mad because if it had been earlier, he feels like the relationship didn't have to end. 

The breakup process has been really emotional and I still have strong feelings for him. We lived in our new apartment for another week and spent quite some time together, we even slept in the same bed for two nights. During that time, we openly expressed our thoughts and feelings and everything was the way we wanted it to be before the breakup. He told me that I surprised him several times when I was able to just listen to him and understand what he means and needs. 

Our last evening together was especially intense. We decided to spent our last evening together, talking, packing my stuff, and watching a movie. After we watched the movie, we hugged, kissed, and both cried. It was a beautiful yet painful experience, as I realized how much we meant to each other in that moment. We then kept passionately hugging and kissing each other in the hallway and other places in the apartment. We also slept in the same bed, where we tightly cuddled all night. The next morning, we cried a lot, kissed each other repeatedly, and hugged intensely, and we both said we loved each other endlessly. So, I feel like the breakup isn‚Äôt fully final in our minds, though we both know that stepping apart is probably the right thing to do for now.

Since moving back into my old apartment today, I‚Äôve felt incredibly lost and emotional. I really miss him and want to see him again to better understand how we both feel, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to seek out that closeness when we‚Äôre supposed to be giving each other space. He mentioned that we could meet for coffee in a few weeks, but for now, we both have our own lives and need time to figure things out, though he said he doesn't want to get hopes up.

What‚Äôs really weighing on me is whether it‚Äôs healthy to continue seeking the closeness and affection I feel for him. At the same time, I‚Äôm wondering how to handle these emotions without putting too much hope into a potential reunion. It‚Äôs tough to keep the distance, especially because I can see a healthy and balanced future with him, but I also understand that we both need time to grow individually.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation. How did you feel when you still had strong emotional attachments after a breakup? What did you do to cope with those feelings without holding on too much to the past? Should I stay in contact, or should I try to disconnect to heal in the long run?

**Why Start Drawing? The Benefits of This Creative Hobby**

Drawing isn‚Äôt just an artistic endeavor; it has numerous cognitive, emotional, and physical benefits.

**Mental and Emotional Benefits**

* **Stress Relief**: According to a study by the *Journal of Art Therapy*, 75% of participants reported reduced stress levels after engaging in drawing for just 20 minutes.
* **Improved Focus**: Drawing helps you stay present, improving mindfulness and concentration.

**Cognitive Benefits**

* **Boosts Creativity**: Engaging in artistic activities like drawing enhances problem-solving skills and encourages out-of-the-box thinking.
* **Enhances Memory**: Studies reveal that drawing can improve memory retention by up to 29% compared to other note-taking methods (*Psychological Science*).

**Physical Benefits**

* **Hand-Eye Coordination**: Regular drawing improves motor skills and coordination.
* **Dexterity**: Beginners often notice improved control over their hands and fingers as they practice.

**Essential Tools for Beginner Artists**

Starting with the right tools can make the learning process smoother and more enjoyable. You don‚Äôt need an elaborate setup; a few basic items are enough to get started.

**1. Drawing Pencils**

* **Graphite Pencils**: Ranging from soft (B) to hard (H), these pencils are ideal for beginners. Start with a medium (HB or 2B) and expand as you progress.
* **Colored Pencils**: Great for adding vibrancy and experimenting with colors.

**2. Erasers**

* **Kneaded Erasers**: These flexible erasers can lift graphite without damaging paper.
* **Vinyl Erasers**: Effective for erasing bold lines and creating highlights.

**3. Paper and Sketchbooks**

* **Sketchbooks**: Portable and perfect for practice. Look for acid-free paper to prevent yellowing over time.
* **Drawing Pads**: Heavier paper is ideal for more detailed work and prevents smudging.

**4. Sharpening Tools**

* **Manual Sharpener**: Ensures precision without wasting pencil material.
* **Sandpaper Blocks**: Used to refine pencil points for intricate details.

**5. Optional Tools**

* **Blending Stumps**: Smooth out shading and create gradients.
* **Rulers and Compasses**: Useful for geometric drawings.

**Techniques for Beginners: The Building Blocks of Drawing**

Mastering basic techniques is crucial for developing a strong foundation in drawing. These skills will help you tackle more complex projects as you progress.

**1. Understanding Line Work**

Lines are the foundation of every drawing. Begin with simple exercises:

* **Straight Lines**: Practice drawing even, straight lines without a ruler.
* **Curved Lines**: Experiment with loops and spirals to develop control.

**2. Learning Shading and Textures**

Shading gives drawings depth and realism. Start with:

* **Hatching**: Parallel lines to create light and shadow.
* **Cross-Hatching**: Overlapping lines for denser shading.
* **Blending**: Use your fingers, blending stumps, or tissues for smooth gradients.

**3. Mastering Proportions**

Proportions ensure that objects look accurate and balanced.

* **Grid Method**: Divide your reference image and paper into equal squares to guide your drawing.
* **Basic Shapes**: Break down complex objects into circles, rectangles, and triangles.

**4. Perspective Drawing**

Perspective adds realism by mimicking how objects appear smaller as they recede.

* **One-Point Perspective**: All lines converge at a single vanishing point.
* **Two-Point Perspective**: Useful for drawing buildings and landscapes.

**Tips for Getting Started with Drawing**

**1. Start Small**

Don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself with large projects. Begin with simple objects like fruits, cups, or leaves.

**2. Embrace Mistakes**

Every artist makes mistakes‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the learning process. Use them as opportunities to improve.

**3. Draw Regularly**

Consistency is key. Even 15 minutes a day can lead to significant improvement over time.

**4. Use References**

Drawing from photographs or real-life objects helps you understand light, shadow, and proportions better.

**5. Experiment with Styles**

Explore different styles, from realistic to abstract, to find what resonates with you.

**Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them**

**1. Fear of Imperfection**

Many beginners worry about their drawings not looking ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Remember, practice makes progress.

**2. Running Out of Ideas**

Join online challenges like Inktober or use prompts to stay inspired.

**3. Lack of Time**

Carry a small sketchbook and draw during breaks or commutes.

**Finding Inspiration for** [**Daily Sketching**](https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts)

One of the biggest challenges beginners face is figuring out what to draw. Fortunately, inspiration is all around you. Start by observing your surroundings‚Äîyour home, a nearby park, or even your favorite coffee shop. Everyday objects like a mug, a flower, or a pair of shoes can serve as excellent subjects. For those looking to practice drawing people, consider sketching family members, friends, or strangers in a public place, capturing their poses and movements.

Additionally, explore online platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, and DeviantArt for sketching prompts or ideas. Many artists share their work and creative challenges, such as #Sketchaday or #Inktober, which can help you stay motivated. Another way to find inspiration is by studying the works of renowned artists. Examine how they use lines, textures, and shadows to bring their drawings to life.

If you prefer structure, try keeping a sketchbook journal where you can assign themes or ideas to different pages. For instance, one page can be dedicated to plants, another to portraits, and another to architectural elements. This not only keeps your practice organized but also allows you to see your progress over time.

**Combining Digital and Traditional Drawing**

The rise of digital drawing tools has opened new avenues for beginners. Combining traditional sketching with digital techniques can be a rewarding experience. Start with a simple pencil sketch, then enhance it using apps like Procreate or Adobe Fresco. These tools allow you to experiment with colors, layers, and textures without committing to permanent changes.

Statistics show that over 47% of artists worldwide use both traditional and digital mediums in their work (*Source: Creative Market*). Digital tools also make it easy to share your progress online, connect with other artists, and receive constructive feedback.

By blending both approaches, you can explore your artistic style more deeply and enjoy the best of both worlds. Traditional drawing hones your fundamental skills, while digital tools add versatility and innovation to your creative process.

**Statistics on the Popularity and Benefits of Drawing**

* The global art supplies market is projected to reach $39.9 billion by 2028, highlighting a growing interest in creative hobbies (*Source: Grand View Research*).
* Online drawing tutorials saw a 75% increase in viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought ways to relieve stress (*Source: Google Trends*).
* According to a survey by *Adobe*, 63% of creative professionals started their careers with drawing as their first artistic activity.

**Free and Paid Resources for Learning Drawing**

**Online Tutorials and Classes**

* **YouTube Channels**: *Proko, Alphonso Dunn, and RapidFireArt* offer excellent free tutorials.
* **Platforms**: Websites like Skillshare and Udemy provide structured courses for beginners.

**Books**

* *Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain* by Betty Edwards
* *Keys to Drawing* by Bert Dodson

**Apps for Digital Drawing**

* Procreate, Adobe Fresco, and SketchBook are excellent tools for beginners exploring digital art.

**Success Stories of Artists Who Started as Beginners**

**1. Leonardo da Vinci**

Even the legendary Leonardo began with basic sketches before creating masterpieces like *Mona Lisa*. His dedication to daily practice was a cornerstone of his success.

**2. Sarah Andersen**

The creator of *Sarah‚Äôs Scribbles* started with simple doodles before becoming a published cartoonist with millions of followers.

**Conclusion: Your Journey into Drawing Begins Today**

Starting your drawing journey is an exciting and fulfilling experience. With the right tools, techniques, and mindset, anyone can learn to draw. Remember, progress takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself.

Whether you‚Äôre sketching for fun, relaxation, or future artistic aspirations, every line you draw brings you closer to mastery. Invest in quality materials, explore various styles, and most importantly, enjoy the process. You can also buy some of the best sketching tools from TrueGether, the best [eBay alternative.](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html)

This morning I woke up with a stomach ache and headed to the bathroom. Whoa boy! I was able to go a lot. I'm thinking I might have been dealing with a couple of days waste. But, I had the worst sweats, felt like I was going to pass out, and had the worst room-spinning dizziness I've ever had for over 1.5 hours. It was worse than when I had a stroke 2 years ago. I was scared. I stumbled to the bedroom and collapsed on the bed thinking that laying down would help. It didn't. I had my hubby help me back to the bathroom. After going through the same above symptoms and finally throwing up what was left, I felt so much better. I did have to sit in bed for about 1.5 hours and I was so cold that I was shivering. But, I've had my coffee and protein shake and took a shower and I'm back to normal. 

So, don't be me. This was the scariest experience and I never want to go through it again. Not gonna lie, I did appreciate the 1.3 lbs lost because I just hit the 50 lbs down mark. üôåüèª

trump should be spending every second of every day doing the job he campaigned to get, but instead he is enriching himself.

Most companies have policies that their salaried employees are not permitted to have an outside job, because they believe that the company deserves 100% of their employees' energy. I believe the same thing about the presidency.

The US presidency is among the most difficult jobs on the planet. The 334,000,000 citizens of the US have a right to expect that the one person we elect to the job of the presidency will actually devote 100% of their energy to it during the 4 years of their term. 

trump campaigned, begged for, demanded the job, so trump should do the job. trump should not be enriching himself instead of working for us. Even 1 second of self-enrichment rather than working for the American people is grotesque.

I‚Äôm currently going through a very tough situation and feel stuck and lost. My partner broke up with me about a week ago, 3 weeks after we got two kittens and 1 week after we moved into our new apartment (before that, we lived in a very small apartment together, where we didn't have enough space individually). Our relationship had a lot of high ups and low downs, especially due to different communication styles and emotional challenges that built up over time. I acknowledge that I have emotional and communicative patterns (e.g., me getting hurt and defensive and relating my feelings to his when he's being critical, which makes him feel like he doesn't get enough space) and an anxious attachment (e.g., not leaving him or myself the space that we needed) that were problematic. In the last 2 months, I‚Äôve done a lot of work on myself (e.g., started therapy and made some changes in my life) because I realized that I have to take responsibility and own my role in the relationship. I think we just didn‚Äôt have enough space and time to grow as individuals while still being in the relationship, especially because we moved forward pretty quickly (e.g., moving in after 3 months) and spent almost all of our time together, including conflicts and their resolution (or lack thereof). I also see that I was/am dependent on him and that I didn't give him the space he needed to talk about his feelings, or even process them himself. Additionally, sometimes when I'm emotional and overwhelmed, I subconsciously get louder, interrupt him, and gesticulate. I don't do this intentionally or in order to dominate him or the conversation but because regulating my emotions isn't easy for me sometimes. He told me that he isn't able to deal with that due to his childhood trauma (violent father) and I fully understand that. Overtime, I was mostly able to change these behavioral patterns (they became less frequent, with the last incident being over a month ago). A few weeks prior to moving into our apartment, he told me that he wasn't sure about our longevity, but ultimately decided to still go through with it because he had trust we can work it out. However, after a conflict a few days after we moved into our new apartment, where I blamed him for something that wasn't intentional or his fault, everything changed. He said that he doesn't feel seen in the relationship and feels like he doesn't have the emotional capacity anymore and that he needs time and space to think about whether he ends it. 

For the following week, we talked everyday, with some communication problems showing up again. However, at the end, I was reasonable to everything he said and he also said that now I understand what he wanted but that it's too late. He said he loves me deeply (and I believe him), but can't go further emotionally, also because he feels alienated and doesn't know how sustainable these changes would be. At this point, I had also written him a long letter, explaining what I reflected on and learned over the past weeks, which I read to him a day after we broke up. He said he was surprised because he didn't expect this level of reason and reflection but that it doesn't change his decision. He also told me that he's mad because if it had been earlier, he feels like the relationship didn't have to end. 

The breakup process has been really emotional and I still have strong feelings for him. We lived in our new apartment for another week and spent quite some time together, we even slept in the same bed for two nights. During that time, we openly expressed our thoughts and feelings and everything was the way we wanted it to be before the breakup. He told me that I surprised him several times when I was able to just listen to him and understand what he means and needs. 

Our last evening together was especially intense. We decided to spent our last evening together, talking, packing my stuff, and watching a movie. After we watched the movie, we hugged, kissed, and both cried. It was a beautiful yet painful experience, as I realized how much we meant to each other in that moment. We then kept passionately hugging and kissing each other in the hallway and other places in the apartment. We also slept in the same bed, where we tightly cuddled all night. The next morning, we cried a lot, kissed each other repeatedly, and hugged intensely, and we both said we loved each other endlessly. So, I feel like the breakup isn‚Äôt fully final in our minds, though we both know that stepping apart is probably the right thing to do for now.

Since moving back into my old apartment today, I‚Äôve felt incredibly lost and emotional. I really miss him and want to see him again to better understand how we both feel, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to seek out that closeness when we‚Äôre supposed to be giving each other space. He mentioned that we could meet for coffee in a few weeks, but for now, we both have our own lives and need time to figure things out, though he said he doesn't want to get hopes up.

What‚Äôs really weighing on me is whether it‚Äôs healthy to continue seeking the closeness and affection I feel for him. At the same time, I‚Äôm wondering how to handle these emotions without putting too much hope into a potential reunion. It‚Äôs tough to keep the distance, especially because I can see a healthy and balanced future with him, but I also understand that we both need time to grow individually.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation. How did you feel when you still had strong emotional attachments after a breakup? What did you do to cope with those feelings without holding on too much to the past? Should I stay in contact, or should I try to disconnect to heal in the long run?

1h3g992,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h3g992/leaving_staying_or_waking_up/,"Leaving, staying, or waking up?","I \[33, F\] am dating a father \[40, M\] of three kids (11, 13, 15). We've been together for almost a year. About a week and a half ago we had a conversation about how, while he has been promoted at work, and has filled his weekend with volunteering with his kids, that he hasn't really scheduled time for the two of us to spend time together. I live an hour away by boat and commute to see him. I've said that I'd be interested in helping with volunteering, too, if it meant being able to see him more.

Last night, I went to his work to drop off coffee and doughnuts. I did some paperwork in town while he went to meet with his previous supervisor about some work related items, then came back to his house for dinner with his elderly mum (whom he takes care of), kids, and me. There were a few disagreeable things he said, but the main thing was he left me with his three kids and went to bed without saying goodnight or trying to connect with me when I tried (""Hey, want to take a quick shower together""? or earlier in the day ""Can we take the dog for a walk together?"" ). ""I can stay in town longer if you're free after you're done"" (""Nope, you should head home, you're busy.""). I made sure the kids went through their routine, went to bed at a reasonable time, and that his kid that was busy with him at his commitment in the morning had the proper attire for what they were doing.

I stayed in the living room after the kids went to bed and did some writing for work... I got especially upset when I woke up to all the lights on, alone, at 2 am. I had a flashback to my last relationship where this would happen as well, but I didn't want to bring it up (why drag the crap from your previous relationship back in?). I didn't want to start an argument or a fight in the middle of the night. I waited and tried to sleep until 4:30 am, hoping that there was coffee open somewhere (there wasn't), I left a note about where I was going and that I was upset but didn't want to wake him up for an argument, and headed to line up for the boat to head home. He texted me in the morning saying that although he couldn't talk (again, volunteering commitments), that it wasn't OK for me to leave in the middle of the night.

We don't live together. We each live apart. I wasn't able to sleep on the couch at all, and I knew that if I had gone to bed beside him I'd just end up continuing to cry and that it would probably wake him up. I didn't want to start an argument as I know he's been exhausted/overcommitted, but I thought that a text was insufficient, and leaving without any indication would have been worse (I think?).

I asked what I should have done, and he didn't have an answer. Alright Reddit, what do you think? Am I a dummy to get involved with a guy with three kids? I'm not saying I need to be a top priority by any means, but I need him to EITHER say that he doesn't have the capacity to see me that day and to try another day, OR to schedule a time in where he CAN manage the capacity. I'd offer to pay for a babysitter if it meant we could have a regular date night. He has 100% custody of his kids (as of 2 months ago), though they were on a 50/50 arrangement with their birth mum when we first started dating.

TL;DR: VERY TL;DR'd without much context above - If you are frustrated with your s/o and don't live with them but you don't want to stay the rest of the night, is it better to wake them up, leave without a note, (edit: leave the house but leave a note, which my boyfriend is angry for me for doing) or stay anyway?",2,1732984208.0,relationships,16,1.0,False

Six beautiful souls showed up for meetup! Which is a big deal considering that this happened on such a short notice.

We met at 90ft, then explored a lot of food joints near Pendarkar college. We ate momos, soya chaap, and summed up the meet at McDonald's with a coffee.

We enjoyed the meetup, and everyone was glad to meet new people.

Hopefully more people can join us in the future, and bring people of Kalyan-Dombivali closer.

1h3g82x,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsleofMan/comments/1h3g82x/i_need_help_moving_out/,I Need Help Moving Out,"I have been living on the promenade in the Douglas area for 6 years, I am a Manx National.  
I have had belly full. The building I live in attracts horrid people like a dung heap does flies, I've *tried* my hardest to be a good neighbor, and I have *tried* to keep myself to myself and now I want out.

Originally I lived up North of the Island and moved out because of differences with my folks, having differences is human and I would rather not go in depth about those disagreements. Since moving out and being alone, I've become a human doormat for people to walk over and wipe their dirty shoes on. Day in, day out, week in and out... What difference does it make anymore?

My neighbor was friendly with me and that has changed now. He has drank the political antifreeze thinking its coolaid and his grey-matter has become a soup of conspiracy, podcast in one ear and gibberish flapping from those lips.

My 6 years on the promenade can be concluded as followed:

\- Me being doing favors for other people, all the time.  
\- Lending money to people and never getting a penny back.  
\- Having my door kicked in because somebody wants to know if I have weed or filters for their fags.  
\- Having my groceries and food stolen without much of a resolution.  
\- Dealing with loud music on the weekends.

Sometimes I feel unsafe, sometimes I feel like I have to agree to the contents flapping from those lips with my head slowly nodding to absolutely effing ad nauseam. I have really had a belly full, I don't want to live in Douglas anymore or as matter of fact, near people who are so pseudo-intellectually full of themselves because they watch Joe Rogan or other conspiracy shite. I am tired of backing into a corner submissively just to feed into my neighbor's ego of being so ""right"" about everything.

I am a gay man, I have always been but even I have an upper-limit to patience. I just cannot anymore, I literally can not.   
I don't feel safe anymore and I lost it when my neighbor talked about vaccines supposedly causing autism, which it doesn't. Correlation is not Causation, you learn this in year 6 in primary school.  
Or what about having a colorful strap on my guitar somehow correlating to pedophilia? It doesn't.  
Or what about having longer hair, does that make me delusional somehow? No, because men can have long hair, I **never** once said I was a woman.  
Or what about machine that only studies the atmosphere somehow equating to controlling the weather or causing the effing northern lights? It's not possible and anyone with an iota of understanding on how science works knows that its just a conspiracy.

I am terrified that if I keep living here, where I am, that it is going to end in a fight. I feel angry, scared, upset...  
Imagine watching someone you considered a friend slip down the slope of literal madness to where you cannot even converse with them anyone because they start breaking down like a machine and regurgitating the same conspiracy slop that big bird mommy Joe Rogan and his podcast fed to him.

I am not even a lefty, and I am not soapboxing myself or my views. All the times I have gone to the shop for my neighbor, or lent him money **WITHOUT** ever asking for it back, all the times I ordered takeout because I felt **sorry** for the miserable state his life is in. I pitied him, I **cared** about him and now... I feel like heat is reached beyond merely a simmering in the pot, I feel like it is going to boil over.

I hate politics and I also hate being involved with them. I don't want to accommodate myself for other people anymore. I just want a quiet life where I can keep myself to myself. I never **asked** to be born, I **don't** want to live most days, my life is suffering enough without this recent crap going on.

My dad, he used to say. ""Wake up, smell the coffee"". Turns out the brew smells like a ripe old turd.

I am looking to move on as soon as possible, I can pay a deposit and rent immediately. I am considered polite by most people that have known me, and I just want a quiet place.  
I am looking for a room or place that is about ¬£130-¬£200/week  
A place where my neighbors aren't uningratiating people beyond my absolute discontent.  
  
I have had a belly full, and its for my own mental health and my own safety that I move out. I don't start fights, and I don't like being in them. I am 26, I am a gay man with autism, I just want to be quiet.",2,1732984119.0,IsleofMan,5,0.6,False

As an adult, my weight has been mostly between 170-210, which is a lot on a 5‚Äô3 frame. Luckily I do carry it well, but still it‚Äôs bad for my mental and physical health to be so heavy. 

In 2018, when I was working on a farm and just living removed from the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù I was happy, healthy, and super active and managed to get down to my lowest weight as an adult at 140. It started to creep back up in 2019, when I left the farm and started working at a coffee shop and going to school full time while working full time. In 2020, the pandemic hit and I put even more weight back on and from 2021 until 6 months ago, I was about 180. At the end of May this year, I had my IUD removed and opted to not have another one put back in, as I ignorantly thought it was my iud that was holding me back from loosing weight. I had started in February eating in a calorie deficit and working out regularly and after an initial 10 pound loss, I gained that back and then some and was back to being 200 pounds. It was extremely frustrating and disheartening, as I worked really hard for 4 months only to gain weight to my heaviest I had been in years. Things are even worst now, as I have gained another 30+ pounds since getting my IUD removed in the end of May. 

My doctor just prescribed my Wegovy snd birth control, as the intense weight gain after getting my birth control removed indicates the progesterone was helping keep my PCOS in check. I am going back and forth about the Wegovy. Obviously I need to lose a serious amount of weight for my physical and mental health. I am just torn because I was able to loose 80+ pounds when I had been working on a farm so even though I‚Äôve struggled in recent years to loose anything despite working out and eating in a deficit, part of me feels like I was able to do it before so I should be able to do it again. The problem is I wasn‚Äôt even trying to loose weight before, and it‚Äôs not a situation I can replicate again as I am finishing grad school and working in a career I love and don‚Äôt see escaping back to the woods as a viable option for me long term.

Hey everyone,
(26M)

I‚Äôve been experiencing some issues, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else relates or has advice. My focus shifts between two extremes: sometimes I can barely concentrate for 5-10 minutes, while other times I‚Äôm so hyper-focused that I‚Äôll stay locked in for hours or even days without a problem. However, the hyper-focused moments are rare(extremely) compared to the times I struggle to focus.
I‚Äôve also noticed problems with my memory and spatial awareness. For example, I‚Äôve been going to the same coffee shop for over a month, but one day I left and had no idea how to get back home. It took a lot of effort to retrace my steps and remember the way. Similarly, I have to go somewhere dozens of times before I remember how to navigate it.
In everyday life, I find myself zoning out a lot. For instance, if I‚Äôm listening to a teacher and suddenly start thinking about something else, I‚Äôll lose track of everything they said. When I snap back, it‚Äôs hard to catch up or make sense of what I missed.
These issues happen quite frequently‚Äîdefinitely more than what I think is average‚Äîand they‚Äôre starting to affect my daily life and studies. Has anyone experienced something similar? Does this sound like something I should be worried about, or is it manageable (any tips?)?

Consider the following: start at (bus to if necessary)  Trinity college. Enter via Front Arch, wander around front square, continue on to New Square. If the Museum building (to your right - its the academic building for Geology, not a museum) is unlocked, pop your head in. Gorgeous interior, a hidden gem in Dublin. If you can get a ticket, you can visit the Book of Kells in the Long library... a major historical treasure, however ths will take quite a bit of your time. Go back through Fellows square in Trinity college, through the modern looking building (Arts block) and out the gate at Nassau Street. Pop into the Kilkenny shop, this is a great place to browse and buy all kinds of Irish crafts, art, clothing, blankets, jewelry, etc. They also have a good cafe upstairs. 
Walk up Kildare street. You'll pass Leinster House, the Irish parliament. Beside it is the National Museum of Ireland, well worth a visit. 4000 years of Irish history. Continue up to St Stephen's Green (Shelbourne hotel is a fairly pricy place for afternoon tea if you'd like to try that). Walk into Stephen's green, wander a bit if you want, bear right to exit at Fusiliers arch (the exit at the top of Grafton Street). Walk down Grafton Street (high street shopping), enjoying the musicians, stop at any shop that looks appealing. Keep your eye out for a tiny lane to your left that says Powerscourt Townhouse center -if time, permits, go down that lane to a hidden shopping center made from a square of Georgian townhouses. Back to Grafton Street, continuing around Trinity College. Must stop at Bewleys Cafe, a Dublin institution. Have tea/coffee and a cake, or lunch. Some touristy shops here.

Second of all, I want to thank the people who take the time to read my post and help answer my questions.

I just bought a Delonghi EX 450.55, and I have a few questions about two options you can choose for your drink: Size and Aroma. Hot drinks will have Aroma Level 1-5. I've tried to search around a bit, and I found this YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZF0VneC56I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZF0VneC56I). In this video, Tom says that the Aroma level will change the amount of coffee beans used for your drink. At Level 5, the machine will grind and use about 14-15g of beans. He doesn't mention anything about the Size setting, so I assume it refers to the water volume, plus milk volume for milk-based drinks. If anybody has a size chart for Delonghi made drinks, please share with me, thank you.

So correct me if I'm wrong but when I choose to make an espresso at Level 5 Aroma, size M, my espresso will use about 14g coffee and 40ml water right ? 

In the video, Tom conducted a dry weight test on a Doppio and found it used about 14g of coffee. So, is the main difference between this (or 2x Espresso) and the size M max intensity single espresso the water volume? Also, why does the 2x Espresso have an Aroma level setting, but the Doppio doesn't ?

Lastly, I noticed that there is no Aroma setting for cold drinks. I wonder why that is, and how can we determine how many grams of beans will be used for a cold drink like a cold cappuccino ?",1,1732983769.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Have been reading the sub and researching for about a month but feel like I'm nowhere near picking.

As someone just starting (only used Moka and Nespresso before) I'm looking for a reliable and we'll built machine at around ~1000CHF budget. 
We are a couple who drinks about 3-4 coffees each a day, both espresso and macchiato/cappuccino.

The key features I'm looking for are:


-short heat up time, 10/15min or less

-good brewing and steaming performance

-good design aesthetic

-reliability and future proof

-ideally made in Italy (as an Italian it would feel weird buying something else for espresso).

I am currently undecided between:

-Lelit Victoria @ 800CHF

-Bezzera BZ10 @ 1100 CHF

-Bezzera Aria S MN @ 1100 CHF

-Quick Mill Pippa @ 800 CHF

-Quick Mill Pop Up @ 900 CHF

Machines are normally a bit more expensive in Switzerland compared to EU, so that impacts a bit. 

I have excluded some machines like Lelit Mara X (heating time), and Gaggia & Rancilio (mostly design aesthetic).

Would really like a recommendation on which to pick among the above as a good and reliable machine that we could start with and keep as we improve our skills as home baristas for at least 5 years.

I mainly enjoy Espresso and Americano, but lately, I‚Äôve been wanting to get more serious about latte art‚Äîso it‚Äôs time for an upgrade!

I make about 2‚Äì4 cups daily, and space is a bit tight; I‚Äôm looking for a machine with a small footprint (around 40x40 cm). I‚Äôm aiming for a programmable experience rather than a fully manual one.

I‚Äôve narrowed it down to two options: the **Lelit Elizabeth** and the **Ascaso Steel Duo**, but I have some concerns and would love your input.  


**Lelit Elizabeth:**

‚Ä¢ Is the size of the boiler sufficient (300ml for coffee and 600ml for steam and hot water), and how easy is it to clean?

‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs the startup time like?



**Ascaso Steel Duo:**

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a thermoblock machine‚Äîis that a downside? I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions and am a bit confused.

‚Ä¢ How bad is the vibration when the pump is working?

‚Ä¢ How does it perform with steaming milk? I heard many say that the steam is not strong but is it consistent? I am suffering from the low consistency steam of Arte and want improvement on that side. 

If anyone has experience with either of these machines or could offer some advice (or even suggest alternatives that fit my needs), I‚Äôd really appreciate it!

It's our first semester and we're just now getting comfortable with one another. We have classes five days a week so we spend a LOT of time together. In a way, it feels like we've been together for years. However, I haven't spent any time hanging out with anyone outside of class, since I'm quite busy and assume everyone else is too (at this point in the semester we're all just talking about how tired we are and most people go right home when the day is over). 

There's one person in my class who I'm interested in. As a friend or maybe something else, I'm not sure yet. I sit with them and a few other people in class, and we've worked on some group projects together. Most of our conversations have been about school, and we haven't talked much just the two of us. I've started sending them memes on Instagram and they've been reciprocating. I feel more comfortable talking to them over text than in person, just because there are always other people around us and I get quite nervous. At some point, I want to ask them out, maybe for coffee or to a museum. They've suggested to the class that we go out all together at some point, so the seeds have already been planted for a group hangout. I don't want to come off too strong, especially because we already see so much of each other and I don't want things to get awkward in class. How can I make it clear that I want to get to know them on a personal level instead of as a ""casual classmate""? I'm thinking it's good to keep messaging them, just to let them know I'm interested in talking to them about things other than school. I'm just scared of trying to approach them more in person because I feel like it'd be so obvious that I have a bit of a crush, and being around my other classmates just adds to the nerves.

My question is, given I‚Äôm quite a nervous person (not necessarily awkward but just overthink these types of things), how do I reach out to him, when, what exactly can I talk about to him at our chat, and any other advice that you guys can give.
