I’m a 6ft, 35 year old male. Started OMAD about two weeks ago at roughly 18 st 3 lb (around 255 lb / 115.6kg), and as of this morning I’m down 7 lb to about 17 st 10 (113kg). 

Energy’s been good, mood is steady, and I’m not struggling with hunger during the day, so it feels pretty easy so far (without jinxing anything :D). I'm happy chugging on water and black coffee through the day.

I’m very much a creature of habit with food and don’t mind eating the same thing most days if it works. My OMAD evening meal is a 10oz (284g) ribeye steak, two large eggs, half a large avocado, half a small tin of anchovies, a small ramekin of kimchi or sauerkraut, a small ramekin of blueberries, and a few pieces of steamed tenderstem broccoli. Some days I’ll also have a small latte with about 150 ml of semi skimmed milk after my meal.

From what I can work out, that puts me somewhere around 1,300-1,400 calories, roughly 90-100 g of protein, quite high fat, and low carbs overall. I feel full after eating and pretty stable through the day, no major crashes or anything.

Just wondering if this looks sensible macro wise long term for someone my size trying to lose weight. I’ve seen people say protein should be higher? Seems like I'm eating a fair bit as it is.

1r51koq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PainManagement/comments/1r51koq/monthly_wds_and_its_messing_me_up/,Monthly WDs and it’s messing me up!,"About 9 months ago I was forced to move from the doctor I had been with 15 years to a new “chain” type place. I don’t mind this new doctor and they’ve actually done more for me in a short time to address my pain points, including surgery’s than my old

Doctor ever did, But here’s my huge issue. My old doctor saw me every 28days and filled my prescriptions at each apt because I live in a small middle of no where town and the small family operated pharmacy I have to use doesn’t always keep thing stocked so there are times I have to wait 1-3 days for my meds to come in on an order so her and I always agreed it was best to have extra in hand for just in case moments like that. And after 15 years with her she knew I took my responsibility of being a pain patient on opiates very seriously. 

Well, this new place has a policy that they will only fill every 31 days but they write for 30. I finally got up the nerve to approach the doctor about it and explain that if I take my dose on day one (fill day) then on day 31, I wake up with no meds and even she said that it’s not ideal in my situation but it’s policy so all she can do is send a note along with my refill to fill it as soon as possible on the due date. She refused to fill it on day 30 saying thier policy is they want you through with the last fill before getting another. Even my insurance allows for 27 day fills but they don’t care. 

I’m up at 5 am every morning to get my kids up and ready for school and our pharmacy doesn’t even open till 9 but most times my prescriptions still aren’t filled until 12-1 (if I’m lucky) so I’m going 7-8 hours before I can even pick them up. 

I’ve always been a super fast metabolizer of my meds to begin with so my doctor has me take my long acting (methadone) every 12 hours with in between doses of oxycodone to help maintain steady pain control. This regimen has worked to keep me functioning well with little pain for years but when I wake up after taking my last dinner time dose, I don’t feel great, not full withdrawal but not great. So I take my first dose right away in the mornings. 

Well now once a month I’m getting into almost full withdrawal before I can even pick up my medication and I’m not sure if putting my body through that every month is causing issues because now it’s starting to feel like even when I’m late on a dose the withdrawal feeling feels like it’s worse than it ever used to be. For example when I wake I’m usually just a small amount of that restless leg feeling like I need to stretch, yawning, and mild anxiety. Now I’m waking almost nightly around 3:30-4 a.m. feeling full on restless legs, yawning, water eyes, anxiety, etc. but I won’t take my medicine any earlier than 5 am because I fell like all that will do is start making the symptoms appear earlier in the night and throw things off more. But I’m literally losing sleep now because I’m waking feeling like that and can’t get back to good rest after until I finally just get up and get coffee and start my day. 

I’m so frustrated with this and I’m not sure what to do if there is anything I can do. I’m in a small middle of nowhere town so options to just move doctors aren’t high and even then finding a doctor that doesn’t want to completely change what works for me is even harder (trust me, I tried for years when I first moved here and they all wanted to do alternative therapies and not opiates ) it’s so unfair and we are at their mercy

I’m so afraid to push too much harder on this too because I don’t want to be “labeled” some kind of way that will mess me up somehow ya know. 

I don’t know if there’s a good answer here, but thanks for letting me commiserate on the struggled of being on opiates for pain in today’s world 😔 ",1,1771118210.0,PainManagement,0,1.0,False

We arrived on the tail end of some nasty weather. We arrived at night, after a rainstorm and delays, but were able to check in to our ocean view suite on B block. We saw that we were on the ground floor and tried to change to a second or third floor, but nothing was available. We were right next to Palazini, on the end. 

We ended up staying, and overall the noise was not bad at all. We like that building, as it’s close to the area where they hold the events and we can use our bathroom or make our own drinks. 

We did hear the leaf blowers and other actors starting at 6, but we ordered coffee which was there by 640 at the latest every day, so not a huge deal. 

Sunset Beach was great. I saved my chairs every day at 7, but there were some available most days. They did hit capacity the last few days and had to get additional chairs. We were there every day and met some awesome couples. We hung out at all the events and are hoping to reconnect in the future. Lunch at SSB is, in my opinion, a hidden gem at the resort. 

Bella Vista was good for dinner, as was Palazini. Casanova was good, but took 2 hours. We talked to one couple for whom it took three hours. Service here was fair at best. Service at all the other restaurants was great. 

Super Bowl was fun, even though we had some buffering early on. Burgers, sausages, wings among other things were available. We enjoyed it even though our team

Lost. 

The special events were great, and we did the AN party and PJ party and had a blast. 

I did use the gym, which was moved from its other location due to damage from hurricane. It’s decent, but tight. I do CrossFit, so it was a little challenging. 

All in all we had a great time. The resort was at capacity, and a majority of people use SSB during the day. Still a great place, and we booked for next year. ",4,1771118111.0,couplesresortsjamaica,0,1.0,False

**Memory transcription subject: Martin Russo, Human Refugee**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 29th, 2136*

\---

“I have no idea what you are talking about.”

The doctor sounds sincere. I have prepared a phone meeting with doctor Sivik, who performed the brain scan on Tom. I’m hoping the Venlil will have more familiarity with extracting useful information from the raw slurry than my own crude hack job: plugging the data into my DNI program and letting ML bridge the gaps.

Last time I was frantic, intimidated him, and standing two meters away. Now I’m over the phone, which is letting us have an actual conversation. “Sorry, let me clarify my question: How do you Venlil extract memory data from a brain scan in a readable format. What software do you use?”

His response is nonplussed. He sounds politely confused. “That’s not a thing that can be done.”

I am looking at the text from the brain scan of Tom. And the text my software spat out from the simpler live-feed scan I performed on Jarkim. “…Doctor, are you saying that there is no known method to extract individual thoughts from a brain scan?”

“Yes. Listen, what we do in a brain scan is make a three-dimensional map of the cellular structure of the brain down to the atomic level. We can also perform a neural scan, which is significantly less invasive as we tend to only record the signals being fired in the brain rather than build a full model. Neural scans can however only be performed on living subjects.”

I am literally looking at the memory transcriptions. “…So again, there is no way to transcribe a memory into plain black-on-white text with either of those methods? You’re quite sure?”

He sighs with some forced patience, but sounds sympathetic. “No. I am sorry, sir, but the brain scan you asked me to perform on Thomas Sinclair is a useful diagnostic tool, and some people have used them as parts of memorials or in failed bids for longevity, but… there’s neither digital life, nor any last messages, after death.”

 

In retrospect it was stupid to assume that this was something they could do just because I had heard they performed a brain scan on Secretary-General Meier. Of course the Federation doesn’t have a way to just read a brain like a book. If they did they wouldn’t need to do empathy tests and be all worried about humanity: They could’ve just scanned one of us and seen that we’re not hiding an evil plan to turn the Federation into an all-you-can-eat buffet. And since they can’t read minds, we are in the current predicament.

*But you… you can do that. You can read minds. With your software, and the Federation’s hardware, you can read minds. Even the minds of the dead. And until someone else connects the dots like you did, you may well be the only one who can.* I realize with a feeling of dread that I may have stumbled upon something massive.

The feeling, the heady vertigo of standing on the precipice, reminds me very unpleasantly of my finger on the trigger. The view of the oblivious avian through the scope, three kilograms of pull weight from death.

I had just been assuming that they could do this. And now I realize I have a potentially enormous amount of power at my disposal. I feel dizzy and sick.

“I see. Thank you for your time.”

 

After the phone call, and a short break to stare at the wall and consider the ramifications, I get Vilek some fresh ice packs. She’ll apparently be done with the heat in a couple of paws, and she’s been largely sequestered in the girls’ room until it’s over. It’ll be nice to hang out with her again. When I open the door to the room it smells thickly of her scent, and I remind myself firmly that Venlil pheromones should not affect humans.

She takes the packs, thanking me while grinding her thighs together and bleeping adorably and flushing orange. I remind myself even more firmly that she’s in an altered state of mind and her ability to consent is compromised. And just in case my sense of ethics isn’t enough, I also remind myself of the consequences if she feels I’ve taken advantage of her hormonal state once she’s back to normal. Her friendship is worth far more than her body.

*You can be patient. Next time we’ll have all talked this out ahead of time and we’ll all be communicating like adults. Besides, it’d be Thiva next, and she’s small enough to grab and pick up and...*

I never said I was a saint. Since I gave Vilek all of the ice packs, I take a cold shower instead.

As soon as I’m sure the right head is doing the thinking, I give it another shot.

*Let’s go over this calmly. You’ve dated two girls. One in high school, and one online and you never even met her in person. And you want to graduate to ‘alien harem’ right away? Look, you’re not made of stone: Of course you want these two girls to be as happy as possible, and you’ve got your own wants. But does that mean those things actually align?*

*Even setting apart the question of if they’d be happier dating other Venlil or other aliens or even other humans… How many poly relationships actually work out, long-term? Mostly the ones with a healthy, stable support net. Would that change matters? If you were to have a job, a support structure, the ability to fall back? Probably not. They’re your friends, and that’s far too important to risk.*

*Sure, you adore them… But you said it yourself: You don’t have anyone or anything else. That’s not love, that’s codependency. You need to work with Vilek to help Thiva get better about her own issues with that. And help Vilek get in touch with human schooling so she can learn some actual mental health instead of this assessor bullshit. And you need to get independence for yourself.*

*Then, maybe. Maybe.*

*But all that’s contingent on one little thing, isn’t it? That they don’t treat you like you deserve, and throw you the hell out today.*

 

The next big thing I’ll do today, after Thiva’s home from class, is gather them in the living room and tell them. About the memory transcripts, the gun, and Jarkim. If I’m going to live here I’m going to have to prove Vansi wrong: They are safe with me.

And for that, I need to come clean to the lambchops. About everything.

And if they end up justly disgusted and need me to leave, then that’s that. I’ll try to travel to the nearest town with a human refuge and see if they’ll take me in. Or they’ll call the Exterminators and I’ll die. Whichever.

Thankfully since I can plan ahead for having a tough discussion for once, that means I can make make some basic contingencies. I can set up resources for Vilek to access the human educational system even in my absence. That part is going to be shockingly easy; If anything I undersold it, basically every Earth university still standing is jostling to have aliens study whatever field they want.

And I can cook. Nonna always said that delivering bad news should always be accompanied by delivering good food.

I have settled on baking some focaccia using the ‘strayu’ oven, making pasta alla norma, and a vegan chocolate cake for dessert. A store specializing in alien items has started selling a small selection of human foods, and everything I can’t find there I instead made sure to order online while planning the meal. Like eggplant, and wine. What kind of civilized store doesn’t carry eggplant?

Once at the store I have to tamp down my expectations. I end up scaring an employee half to death by rounding a corner too quickly, and then everything in the tiny human-foods corner is preserves: Canned tomatoes, dried basil, garlic powder, instant coffee… Even so I look forward to getting to cook with human ingredients again, instead of relying on the local fare.

 

When I get home, I can immediately tell there’s something wrong. A few Venlil students are loitering outside the building and talking in hushed voices. When I arrive they part like the red sea and let me through. Up the stairs to our apartment, I find the door hanging limply, halfway on its frame.

I feel a surge of adrenaline and start taking in every detail, tearing off my mask as I stalk forward quietly. The door’s been broken open at the handle with some sort of rough tool, like a crowbar. The air smells of wood pulp and the dust of whatever the aliens use for plaster or drywall.

I step inside. My boots crunch bits of wood chips and stone underfoot. Some of the furniture’s been overturned, and the couch cushions have been thrown around.

I smell blood, sweet and metallic. Not a lot, but enough to stop my heart for a second.

“Girls?! Thiva?! Vilek?!”

I rush inside, armed only with my bag of groceries. My bedroom door’s been torn open, but I ignore it in my rush to get to the girls’ room. It’s in the same state.

When I get inside, Vilek’s prone on the ground. My heart stops again. I try to remember everything I know about first aid, and somewhere in the far-off distance my groceries clatter to the floor.

*ABCDE, ABCDE, A’s for Airway B’s for breathing C’s for whatever focus A for Airway! Check consciousness and then check airway!*

I shake her. “Vilek, Vilek! Are you alright, can you hear me?”

She stirs and lets out a quiet, sobbing whine of pain. The fur on her head is smeared with sticky orange blood. I take a breath and hear myself rambling. “Alright, alright, uhh…”

*Okay airway’s clear breathing’s clear she’s responsive what else what next-*

She sobs again, turning her head to look at me with a face streaked with tears and blood. A glance down at her leg tells me its angle is entirely wrong, too. “They took her… it hurts…”

My blood runs cold. I maintain enough cognizance to stagger up and fetch the first-aid tools from the living room. At a glance the tools look alien. Of course.

*I have no fucking idea how to use these. God fucking dammit.*

“Vilek, listen… you’ve got a head wound, and maybe a dislocated or broken leg. Can you guide me through using this on you? Humans use different tools for first aid.”

She flicks her tail once, and it thumps weakly against the ground. That’s a yes. She speaks quietly, and her claws grasp my leg and squeeze down. I ignore the pain. “First you use the clippers to cut away any fur over the area…”

“That’s a pity, you’ve got such beautiful fur. Alright, just stay still.” I try to sound casual and calm while using what turns out to be the kit’s razor to shave her head. Or possibly shear it. She whines and squirms as the shear runs over the cut in her scalp. It’s a pretty long one, but not deep. I don’t know much about Venlil biology but on a human it’d look worse than it is. I clean the area with a cloth with some water to fully expose the wound.

She hisses in pain. “N-Now, there’s a jar of stitching gel. Just open it and apply some… a good pawful or so, th-there’s no need to be stingy.”

I listen to her command. The gel jar’s lid is already loose from being used on Thiva a few paws back. The gel has an antiseptic, chemical stench. I smear it on her wound directly, and she cries out in shock and pain. It makes me flinch… But the gel quickly reacts with the blood and makes it coagulate, stopping the bleeding.

“S-Shit, that smarts! Fuck!… Now there’s a bundle of cloth c-called a bandage…”

“Yeah, we have those too. Hold on.” I bandage her head inexpertly. Trying to go around her ears is a challenge, but I make it work. “Alright… that leg isn’t bleeding, so let’s not fuck with it. We’ll call for transport to the hospital. Now… what the hell happened?”

“The Exterminators came a-and broke the door down. They were here for Thiva…” She sobs. “I tried to stop them, I promise!”

*What’s one girl supposed to do against a bunch of armed pyromaniacs?* “I believe you. Look… If her mom called them here, it’s because of a report of Predator Disease, right?”

Her ears fold affirmative this time, though even that slight movement made her cringe.

“And we know it’s bullshit, just Vansi retaliating. So we’ll fix this. First we’re getting you to the hospital. Then I’m going to head down to their office and sort this out.”

I don’t believe for a second it’ll be that easy.

 

Showing up to the hospital with a bloody Venlil in my arms causes a bit of a commotion. One of the ER nurses responds immediately upon seeing an unmasked human covered in orange blood: He screams, turns, and runs directly into a wall at a dead sprint. Ends up so concussed he needs more urgent help than Vilek.

Thankfully some others have their heads on straight for once. A Zurulian nurse ends up taking information from me in a remarkably professional way, getting all the information I had available quickly and efficiently while the doctors start seeing to Vilek’s injuries.

“Alright human… We’ll take care of her, and from what it looks like she should make a full recovery. I just want to say it’s remarkable that you managed to fight your instincts long enough to help her.”

I am briefly livid, but manage to bite it down to a terse explanation. “She’s one of my closest friends in the whole galaxy. Every instinct in my body has been to protect and help her. For God’s sake, not even the greys are as bad as that. Your people went to Earth and saw the Arxur aid with search and rescue efforts, with literally not a single incident of predation.” *Upon sapients, anyway.*

The Zurulian blinks and lowers her head in a sort of bow. “…I’ve been rude to you. My apologies.”

*Wow. I did not think that was going to work.* “Thank you, apology accepted. Is there someplace I can wait that won’t upset the other staff and patients? I need to talk to her.”

It turns out there is, but it’s literally a janitor’s closet. I still wait patiently for the Zurulian nurse to fetch me to see Vilek, who’s got a room to herself after it was made clear that her guests will include a human.

She’s no longer bloody, and her leg’s in a cast. Her eye looks unfocused and bleary as she smiles at me with her ears and gives an unexpected giggle. “Heyyyy Martin! They’re ssso nice here! Donn worry, I toldem you dinn do it!” The translator somehow manages to pick up the fact that the words are slurred.

I glance at the teddy bear nurse. “You guys gave her the good stuff, huh?”

“We had to align and re-fuse the bones, that’s not the sort of thing you do without sedatives.”

Talking to Vilek like this is pointless. But there’s something I can do. “Um, miss…”

“Freysi.”

“Miss Freysi, would it be possible for me to have a few minutes alone with my friend? I’ll be leaving right after, I just need to make sure she’s okay.”

“Alright… but there are cameras, so behave yourself.” I choose to believe she’s referring to displays of affection, and not anything more sinister.

As soon as nurse Freysi leaves, I reach into my backpack and finger the box containing the neural scanner… Then I take it out and reach over to scratch Vilek’s ears and neck carefully. “Hey, Vilek, how are you feeling?”

She giggles again. “Heyyy, you fixed the thing right? The thing withhh Thiva?” I carefully attach the electrodes and pull out my pad.

1r51iw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r51iw8/did_i_blow_it/,Did I blow it?,"So there's this barista at a coffee shop I go to that I've had a crush on for a while, probably since before summer but I don't remember exactly when we first met, but it's been a while. I went to work up in Alaska this summer and was out of town for two and a half months, so I wasn't around to see her at all or go into the coffee shop. When I returned I saw her once when I went in, and two other times I popped in and didn't see her. I left on a long trip at the beginning of November and was in Europe for over a month and came back to spend the holidays with fam back home, and was again out of town for a total of about two months. We only ever had short conversations across from the register but I was always very attracted to her even in brief moments like that. 

I've been back in town now for a little over a month and this week went in to the coffee shop for the first time since returning from the trip, and since it was so busy I had to sit at the bar, which overlooks the coffee station while I did some work on my laptop. I was pretty locked in, mostly booking flights for this next trip I'm about to go on, along with some light reading, and a little bit of a wandering eye. To put it lightly, I liked what I saw, and confirmed I'm very attracted to her. Well, I went in the next day with a paper note that had my number on it, but she wasn't there. 

And usually I wouldn't do this many days in a row of going in to see someone, but I'm leaving for another trip on Sunday, so I really wanted to see her again potentially a couple times before I leave. I go in the third day and I see her, not at the counter where I wanted to see her and slide her my number. Instead she was making coffee, we said hi, I ordered, stepped back, looked at her, and got all giddy and smiled, then coughed to compose my self and maybe for her to see me. Got my coffee and left. 

Today rolls around and I go in to see her on my last day in town, I sat in the parking lot for nearly an hour, so nervous to go in and see her, if she's even working. I go in, see the counter and see she's not there. ""Damn."" I said under my breath. But continued up to the counter and briefly checked in the back, where they take the dishes and store everything they aren't using. Thought I completely struck out, not before I saw a dark silhouette past the door, and I knew she was working, and soon walking right behind me, going to hang up some clothes because the coffee shop also doubles as a thrift store. 

I go to the bathroom, take a leak, collect myself real quick, and then go back out there. I go up and ask if there was any clothes she thought might be good for the place I'm going, and we had our first real conversation and it was great. I want her so badly. What I'm hung up about, but through the process of writing this out I feel a little better about is that I didn't give her my number, and honestly I'm crushed to go on the trip and for potentially ruining anything that 'could have been' on my last night in town on vday, or to even be able to get to know each other a little bit more, and for the story, I honestly had the perfect moment to slip her my note and I didn't.. but maybe it would have been too soon? I don't know, I can't help but feel like I totally blew it, not giving her the note saying ""Hey, text me what it takes to make that booty mine =)"". I blew it. Now I'll have to go on this trip knowing that I did, and waiting for who knows how long until I can finally slip her that note, perhaps when I return, yes, perhaps then.. Perhaps I blew it and that's just that and that's all there is to it. But it was the first time we've really interacted when she wasn't behind a counter, so perhaps I dodged a bullet and that would have came on way too strong. So maybe it's not too bad☺️ I really like herrr",3,1771118060.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1r51hk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1r51hk6/aita_for_being_upset_with_the_hired_driver_i_paid/,AITA for being upset with the hired driver I paid for during my vacation,"Here’s the story:

I went on a solo vacation to a foreign Asian country. It’s season for cherry blossom viewing there, the primary reason for me choosing that country for a short vacation (my work just dumped me a last minute project I have to present on the day after I get back, super stressed). 

At the hotel, I figured since most flower viewing places are remote, I can ask the hotel to suggestions to hire a driver for half a day to take me to some of those places instead of fighting with public transportation (most often aren’t direct and involved transfers and walking). 

My only requirement is to be able to view cherry blossoms, I’ll let the driver decide where best to take me. What a h\*llish experience…

He keep asking me all personal questions (where’s your husband, why are you single, how old are you, what month and year were you born, what country you from, etc etc).  I answered because I try to be polite and respectful of their culture (sometimes Asian countries are known for asking strangers invasive questions like their pay and their home town etc to build relationship). Well it gets worse, he kept swinging the conversation with replies that sound like hitting on me, which I find gross and offended because I don’t feel I look like I’m a traveler looking for random hookups. 

Examples:

I was trying to find something neutral to chat about in the car ride, so I asked if the driver had any hobbies. He said “I collect beautiful women. You should come home with me.”

When he asked what’s my plans for the rest of my vacation, I said I plan to relax and not planning to fill my day with activities. He said “oh you should call me, I’ll take you for free to a park to enjoy a cup of coffee and spend the evening for dinner.”

I stayed in an area where there’s hot springs (also a reason I went there besides flower viewing). He said, “Let me tell you, you came to the right place. This is such a paradise for men to have a gooood time. Women are like the water…” (I don’t know why but that got me mentally gagging abit). 

Anyways, so super creepy. If that’s how Asians talk, I can’t stand it. But what really pissed me off was, at the first landmark, it was a garden that was supposed to have cherry blossoms, but the flowers weren’t fully in bloom, so I end up didn’t get to take any good pictures of flowers. I hired him for 4 hours, thinking he can take me to other alternative choices easily. 

He offered to help me take a couple of pictures. I was fine because tour drivers do that for solo travelers too. But he used his own phone to take a couple pictures I was like, no, please use my phone. He’s like, wait, let me get a couple first.. and then took my phone to take a few pictures of me. Later he had no indication of sending me those pictures he took, and I’m like why the heck this guy is keeping my picture on his phone. Make me super uncomfortable. I feel like yelling and demanding him to delete those pictures but again I just silently endured the feelings and acted respectful and polite. Hoping he’d do the right thing and don’t use my picture for anything bad or tracking me down later on social media etc.

Well, the second place he dumped me at the foot of a trail of a nearby mountain. Granted, I’m fine with hiking, but it’s a Rocky Mountain with no flowers. I asked him what’s with this choice. He said it’s a nearby attraction, since I look young and able to hike. Well I googled the trail would take 1.5 hours, and it’s a steady climb, while he gets to nap in his car in the parking lot. I thought, well, it’s a somewhat famous landmark, I might as well check it out. Well, so I climbed about 20min (all rocky stairs), and met a family coming down. I asked them how far to go, they said it would be at least another 50min to the top, and showed me the summit (it’s full of rocks too). I’m like, h\*ll no I’m not wasting my time here, and proceeded to climb back down. I went to the parking lot and he was like, I thought you were strong. I said, no, take me to somewhere else.

So he took me to a third little garden (again, no cherry blossoms). By then, I’ve only got 1.5 hours left out of 4 hours. He was like, well, there is a really nice place for cherry blossom viewing but that’s like 40 minutes away, so we won’t have time. You can find me tomorrow or the next couple days and we can go then. He start giving me advices and stuff. I’m thinking “you don’t even know me. Quit telling me irrelevant stuff.” The fact I’m traveling to a foreign country alone, should show I probably don’t need his advices. But he kept yapping. I just smile and nod to be polite. Again.

By then, I’m furious. The only thing I actually want to do on this trip was cherry blossoms, but when the first place didn’t work out, he wasted my time taking me to go rock climbing and then another old ugly garden that doesn’t even have cherry blossoms. By now, he tell me there’s a famous place for cherry blossoms when we ran out of time???

Anyways, at the end, that last 1.5 hours I just told him to stop by a nearby tourist landmark and I went there to walk around for 20min before heading back to the hotel.

On the way back, he’s still yapping about there’s lots of food he can take me around, and how he sensed we had a connection and he’d love to see me again etc.

All this time, I’m just disgusted by every comment his said (stuff like how I got beautiful skin, how women need to be taken care of by men), upset I wasted my time and money, and I already politely declined all his “future” suggestions by saying I’m jetlagged, just want to go back to the hotel, I don’t want to eat anything random to get travelers diarrhea etc. By the time I paid and got off the car, he’s still grabbing my backpack and insist on carrying it for me back into the hotel lobby. I got it back after I got to the counter and just ran off. 

I question life, question whatever gone wrong on this encounter. Like, I’d feel like I failed if he hadn’t felt we had a connection because then I’d have been unfriendly, but I had no intentions of wanting to be BFFs or even see him again. Especially it spooks me how I just want to pay and get the service I want rendered, I have no desire to take up his offer to meet with him later for free to spend any time together, dinner or coffee or to other places. 

Now I’m just planning my own trip to that other place he said have good cherry blossom viewing (in fact the internet posted recent pictures of REALLY good flowers in bloom), I’m taking public transportation and Uber to get there. Forget hired drivers. It’s best I do everything on my own. =\_=

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qxroby/aitah_for_asking_my_neighbor_to_wait_for_her/)**: February 6, 2026**

Yesterday after I picked my son up from school my neighbor flagged me down in the driveway to ask me if she could use my laundry machine because hers was broken. I said sure, because she's my neighbor. While she was in her house gathering her laundry I made grilled cheeses for myself and my son. When she came over I showed her where the machine was. After loading the machine she came into the kitchen.

My neighbor asked if she could have a grilled cheese. I might just be a dick, but I thought that was a ridiculous thing to ask. I told her I only made two. She asked why I did that since I knew she was coming over??? Because she was coming over for laundry, not grilled cheese...

My son offered her half of his. I always put an egg in my grilled cheese sandwiches. She bit into it and was grossed out by the egg (which she should have seen before she bit into it). She then asked where my trash can was. My son said ""don't waste food!"" So she just HANDED THE SANDWICH BACK TO HIM. I told him to switch halves with me and then binned the sandwich half when he wasn't looking.

She asked to use my bathroom, which I of course agreed to. She came back to the kitchen after and asked if I had any refreshments. I said no and suggested that she wait for her clothes to finish at home. She asked if I was trying to get rid of her. I said we needed to get started on homework. She said she didn't mind. I said we needed to keep distraction to a minimum.

She said ""well, I know when I'm not wanted,"" and left. When she came back to switch her clothes to the drier, she was very irritated. I apologized for hurting her feelings. She said it didn't matter, but she sounded angry. Then she left. I feel bad, but I also feel annoyed, because who acts like that?

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

**anonanon-do-do-do:** NTA. Is she elderly? If so, she is probably lonely. Or she might just be very nosy.

>**OOP:** I think she's in her thirties. Maybe a hot early forties. Also she's married and has kids.

**Sea-Operation-6123:** How close are you with this woman? Has she been in your house before? Do y’all socialize? This whole thing is … very strange.

NTA - Let her be upset. If she doesn’t get why she was rude, you’re not gonna be able to explain it to her.

>**OOP:** I actually just moved here last month. I think I've spoken to her maybe twice? This was her first time coming into my house. I also think it was strange to be honest.

**mochi7227:** She wants to be in your life.  
Are you a guy or a lady?

>**OOP:** A guy.

**mangogetter:** Aha!

>**OOP:** She's married. And she's at least ten years older than me.

**CoCoaStitchesArt:** Well, people can still cheat even if married. She was super entitled and weird.

>**OOP:** Oh I know. Been there. Yeah, I really don't want her around me either way at this point.

**Beth21286:** Whoa nelly does that woman need to learn some basic manners. Clearly she didn't know when she wasn't wanted but hopefully she does now. Yeesh.

I hope you explained to your kid how ill-mannered she was and to never behave like that in other people's homes.

>**OOP:** Yeah, she put me in an awkward position with him. Obviously I want to model for him to always be polite and welcoming, but there is a limit. It's a more nuanced situation than a five year old can probably grasp.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qyxbcc/update_aitah_for_asking_my_neighbor_to_wait_for/)**: February 7, 2026 (Next Day)** 

I have a tiny update about my weird neighbor with the broken washing machine. She came back! I know 90% of you said to never let her back in the house, so you are probably going to judge me heavily. In my defense I was a little flustered by the whole thing.

She waved me down again when we were walking up to the house. She said to wait because she had something for me. I waited because... I guess because I'm stupid? I figured she would just knock on the door anyway if I didn't.

She came back with a pie that she said was thanks for using my washing machine. I said thank you and she didn't have to. She said ""let's go inside and try a piece."" I said it was almost my son's naptime. She said ""great! We can eat pie while he naps!""

A lot of you said she might have been interested in me, and that was still in my head. So I said ""yeah, and you should invite your husband over too."" I was expecting that to deter her. Nope!

She got very excited! She said ""that's a great idea! Here, you take the pie in and I'll go get him."" So at that point I'm internally thinking ""what the fu...."" My son and I went inside. I started cutting pieces of pie because at this point I felt like a victim of fate.

She came over with her husband. I have never seen a man that looked as exasperated and embarrassed as this guy. We ate pie, and the whole time she asked me weird questions while her husband looked annoyed. Every once in a while I would say something and she would give her husband a look. He kept pretending not to see the looks.

After we finished the pie, she asked if I had coffee. Her husband said ""Honey, he wants to put his son down for a nap. Let's go home.""

She said ""oh he doesn't mind.""

Her husband said ""he minds"" while he took her elbow and started leading her out the door. She kept insisting that I didn't until they were outside. I gotta say, I think I'm in love with this guy.

As weird and annoying as the whole thing was, I feel a lot better about my neighbor now. Some of the comments had some pretty crazy speculation that made me a little nervous. Now that I've met her husband I'm pretty sure she's just bored. Which is fine. It's annoying, but not creepy.

So to all the people who were worried she was trying to seduce me or spy on me or steal from me, don't worry. Based on her husband's reactions she's just... like this.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

**EmpoweRED21:** Obv NTA but sounds like you’ve made a new buddy.

He definitely goes through it on the daily judging by his actions. Hey, at least you got some pie out of it

>**OOP:** This is going to sound so bad, but... The pie wasn't that good. Way too much sugar.  
*To another commenter:*   
It wasn't that great. To answer the question below, it was an apple pie. It was canned filling and had way too much sugar. It wasn't the worst pie ever, but she didn't even do a lattice crust. That's like the whole point of making a pie.

**Complete\_General\_546:** Okay: are you a super interesting person? I was thinking it was a your neighbor person but now I’m curious if you are just really intriguing? 

People are always asking My husband and I questions and I realized  this after I was like why are there always freaks who try to be friends with me haha. 

>**OOP:** Not really. I'm divorced. I have a kid. She seemed really zeroed in on that topic. I think divorce is actually pretty common, but maybe not in her social circle. My son and I are in a minority group. Not a super interesting one or anything though.

**NorthQuestDirection:** Oh shit, she absolutely wants to set you up with someone she knows.

>**OOP:** Nooooo. I don't want a rebound girlfriend. I don't want to be one of those guys.

**HUNGWHITEBOI25:** absolutely…but ngl Op was kiindoff an idiot inviting the husband over too…

>**OOP:** I figured if I said that and she was freaked out, proof that she has bad intentions. If I said it and she wasn't, I don't need to worry about her trying to seduce me. So at least I now have that peace of mind.

**willowsquest:** Some suburban-type women have a slight fixation on the notions of kids and motherhood, idk if your neighbours have their own kids (part of me assumes not if she has time to be doing all this lol), but maybe she has some half-baked subconscious idea about being a ""feminine influence"" for the poor divorced man and his motherless son lmao. Not in a ""I'm gonna be your mom"" way, but in the slightly bored, maybe-well-intentioned busybody neighbor way where she'll assume ""well SOME WOMAN has to get involved in their lives, so it may as well be me"". As though being a Woman Within Proximity confers a natural positive influence, with the ""woman's touch"" in the sense of ""she'll happily rearrange your couch pillows if you let her"". Or something. She might also just be weird in a general Bad At Social Cues way lmao

>**OOP:** I think this is it. I'm pretty sure her kids are teenagers. So maybe now that her kids are at the ""leave me alone"" age she wants a project. Based on her behavior and a lot of the comments I feel this is most likely.

**fornikate777:** Stay with me.....is she white and are you a minority?

>**OOP:** Yes.

**mangopango123:** I am soooo curious bc i been going thru the comments n can’t find any about this part of your story, but can you pls give me any examples of the weird qs she asked you?? And what/why were the looks about?? I hope you see my comment bc idk why but I really wanna know lmao

>**OOP:** Mostly stuff about my divorce. I'm not salty about my divorce, so it didn't hurt my feelings, but she didn't know that, so I thought it was rude/weird. She wanted to know how long ago I got divorced, where we used to live, why I moved, why I have primary custody, what school my kid used to go to, what my ex-wife does for work, how she feels about not being the primary parent, nosy stuff. She also asked why we got divorced, which I didn't have to answer because her husband actually cut her off on that one. He said ""that's a private matter,"" and she dropped it.",51,1771117872.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,7,0.92,False

The students sometimes like to mess with the teacher by asking her outrageous requests. One student, as a joke, asked her if he could drink out of her Starbucks coffee. Surprisingly, the teacher obliged. The student removed the lid (thankfully), drank some of her coffee, and then laughed about it with his friends.

**Eastern Small Town • Former Nun Dormitory of the Madonna Society**

At noon, Xia Yu was in one of the units inside, arranging a newly bought bouquet into a vase, carefully adjusting the stems to make the flowers look more pleasing.

Fang Ming had just returned from the nearby market with groceries. As he entered the home, he walked up to Xia Yu and hugged her from behind, saying gently, “Yu, happy birthday!”

https://preview.redd.it/8wl6yaia4kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=4301c47eb5160b3a95446e068ca0b777db2dfbfd

Xia Yu nudged him with her elbow, teasing, “You already wished me that this morning! Hey, you’re not getting senile, are you? Don’t scare me!”

Fang Ming laughed, “Of course not! I’m saying it on behalf of Fengfeng. Look—our good grandson made you this birthday card.”

Xia Yu looked down and saw that Fang Ming, still hugging her, was holding an open birthday card with crooked handwriting that read:

“Grandma,

Happy Birthday! Wishing you happiness as vast as the Eastern Sea, and a long life like the Southern Mountain.

Respectfully, your grandson Fengfeng”

https://preview.redd.it/nc9xg6kb4kjg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c2c624927c5ca1716965a2d1d844b10a268b12

The child’s handwriting made the character for “longevity” especially large due to its many strokes. Xia Yu smiled and frowned, “Sigh, Mei really needs to have Fengfeng practice his writing more!”

As Fang Ming put the groceries in the fridge, he said, “Don’t be too greedy, Grand Dame. Kids growing up over there, many can’t even speak Chinese anymore. It’s rare that he’s willing to write you so many Chinese characters, and you’re still complaining about his handwriting!”

Time flies. Xia Lishu and Yin Mei’s son, Xia Rufeng, was already five years old.

Fang Ming was semi-retired now. He and Xia Yu both wanted to return to their roots, so they moved back to the eastern small town and rented a small unit in a serviced apartment converted from the Madonna Society’s nun dormitory.

Now, they spent at least half the year in the town, living here—after all, this was the community where they were born and raised. Xia Yu left the San Francisco supermarket business to her daughter-in-law, Yin Mei.

https://preview.redd.it/2fhrr62e4kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=5285ce19c1088959964d272a4f1801c08b1e4858

Fang Ming sat on the sofa and turned on the TV. The news immediately reported:

""Madonna Society President Judy, English name JUDY, was found guilty of multiple charges including embezzling donations, falsifying accounts, money laundering, and fraud, and was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Additionally, in recent years, the Madonna Society suffered massive losses from real estate speculation, accumulating over one billion in debt and facing liquidation...""

“Sigh, the whole city’s in an uproar lately, all because of the Madonna Society’s scandals.” Xia Yu finished arranging the bouquet, went to the kitchen to make two cups of hot tea, and brought them to the living room to sit by Fang Ming.

“Who would have thought that the once-glorious Madonna Society would decline so fast in just five years? Now it might disappear altogether,” Xia Yu said with emotion.

https://preview.redd.it/f94n3a2i4kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3ac4494fb8a981ac4ebfbd61b191fb4c997eb6

“Remember two years ago when we visited the Madonna Primary School in the new town? That statue of Wang Rong was supposed to be a landmark, but nobody cleaned it anymore, and even the so-called rose sea around it was all rusted and neglected. The Madonna Chapel next door was locked up tight too.”

Fang Ming sipped his tea and continued, “It’s all because Bai’s eldest son’s mistress couldn’t marry in. The Wang Rong myth collapsed, so they couldn’t use huge donations to fill the holes left by failed investments. Collapse was inevitable.” His face still carried a hint of mockery.

“Not just the chapel—even the Madonna Primary School closed two years ago due to low enrollment. Over the years, the Society kept selling off properties; there are fewer and fewer halls left.” Xia Yu felt regretful—after all, the Madonna Society had over a hundred years of history and was especially important to the town’s poor districts.

“The Society should always have been a neighborhood welfare group serving the poor. After Wang Rong took charge, she ran it like a business, seeking fame and expanding political influence. The direction was wrong from the start!”

Fang Ming was indignant, because both he and Xia Yu, who grew up in the poor district, had benefited from the Madonna Society, and had also attended the Madonna Primary School.

https://preview.redd.it/das6os2p4kjg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5a54c175ad11be0dd299fefdd34b083c139c62

Now, this century-old organization was destined for the graveyard of history, and they felt a touch of sadness.

“That Judy worked for Wang Rong for years—they’re birds of a feather, both profit-driven!” Fang Ming watched the TV, seeing Judy’s haggard, dazed face at her arrest, feeling only contempt. “At least Bai Shikun had a conscience—he bought this nun’s dormitory and just converted it for rental, keeping its original look.”

“Ming, do you think... where is Wang Rong now? You’ve dreamed about her more than once, and I’m worried...” Xia Yu recalled her husband’s unsettling dreams and was clearly anxious.

“Yu, don’t worry about that. She won’t bother me again.” Fang Ming held his wife’s hand and smiled gently.

Seeing Xia Yu’s doubt, Fang Ming explained, “Just the day before yesterday, I dreamed of that girl in white again. She took me to see the Wang Rong statue. I watched as it weathered rapidly, finally turning into a pile of sand, blown away by the wind.”

Xia Yu thought for a moment, wanting to ask more, but Fang Ming had already stood up.

https://preview.redd.it/l1l29j6r4kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=847b038f0053cdee5f6568873ba413924bc50249

“Hey, today’s your birthday—don’t just sit inside! Let’s go to the big mall across the street: shopping, a movie, and a big dinner to celebrate your 68th birthday!” Fang Ming, full of enthusiasm, pulled his wife up.

Xia Yu, a little annoyed, playfully punched his chest but happily put on her coat. The couple walked hand in hand to the big mall across the street—once the site of the Madonna Primary School.

After a lifetime, the couple returned together to the place where they grew up, back to the starting point of their lives. The difference now was that every day ahead would be fulfilling and happy.

https://preview.redd.it/hpm17bxt4kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0541a359bdbec3f15a5e9d438e882f3e058cb0c

And so, time passed, and ages changed.

https://preview.redd.it/1pzbsb7x4kjg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=430dde5b01c62a9ceb757a4dcb3481c47ba8d52c

It was Christmas. The apartment where Fang Ming and Xia Yu spent their later years, converted from the Madonna Society’s nun dormitory, was now completely covered in curtains and scaffolding, about to undergo a year-long renovation.

Across the street, the mall built on the site of the old Madonna Primary School had, five years earlier, begun phased expansion and incorporated a nature-inspired design, becoming a large garden-style shopping center combining leisure, entertainment, and conservation.

https://preview.redd.it/ymbd9wj15kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=5465444ea0c5aa373c9c491d809f6700bce1c5e2

The mall’s roof and exterior used new glass curtain walls that retained heat in winter and insulated in summer, maximizing natural lighting. Inside, trees lined the paths, streams and waterfalls flowed between shops, and only green energy was used. Part of the mall was a botanical park, where visitors could boat in artificial rapids.

From the outside, the mall looked like a giant greenhouse.

Now, this super-greenhouse was brightly decorated, not only for the holidays but also in preparation for its centennial celebration.

https://preview.redd.it/wn3wo2r35kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e5dca0635a159aa6a5211abbe2c86d022756854

The poor district where Fang Ming and Xia Yu grew up had long since vanished.

Now, the area was one of the city’s few middle-class residential and commercial districts. The old poor district was preserved as a single street of heritage buildings, as proof that such an era once existed.

The Madonna Society’s nun dormitory was, of course, among them.

In a quiet café inside the greenhouse mall, a girl in a pale blue sweater and white skirt sat beside a peach tree in the corner, applying lipstick in front of a mirror. The reflection showed Long’er’s ethereal beauty.

A hundred years had passed, yet Long’er still appeared as an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old girl, with the same peach-blossom beauty and youthful face.

https://preview.redd.it/6g5btw075kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc09a3804bf5bf1070acfea9a98420bbd67e0cd9

“Long’er, you really had me looking for you.” A deep, magnetic male voice came from behind her, with a stern tone and a hint of affectionate reproach.

“It’s rare to revisit old haunts; I just wanted to wander by myself for a bit. Didn’t I tell you I was at Eden Café?” Long’er immediately stood up and clung to the man’s arm, acting coy.

“This place is so tucked away—I walked around several times to find it. Hmph, they did a good job with the renovations, but can’t even manage a decent store map!” The man was still grumbling.

He had wanted to say, “Why not pick a more prominent spot?” but with his beloved wife on his arm, he could only blame others.

The man was, of course, Bai Shikun—now looking as he did in his thirties.

Bai Shikun, originally Eurasian, was now even taller and more striking, with deep-set features, a black coat and gray trousers—simple yet stylish. Anyone who saw him would marvel at his rare, extraordinary handsomeness.

“Don’t be mad, I’ll get you some coffee.” Long’er smiled brightly.

Her smile instantly lifted his mood. Both were stunningly attractive, and even the few people in the café couldn’t help but admire them.

Other than that, they were just like any couple enjoying time together.

Visiting old places naturally brought up old people and memories.

https://preview.redd.it/6qc3fkx85kjg1.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=d515b55f06132bbd717d9bf0b698400ad7c8b70a

Bai Shikun couldn’t help but ask, “Long’er, is that woman still in the statue?”  
“Of course, where else could she go?” Long’er replied nonchalantly, sipping her coffee.

“Just leaving her like that... is that really okay?” Bai Shikun trusted his wife’s abilities but preferred neat solutions by nature.

As they were about to leave the café, Long’er took his arm and softly said, “Don’t worry. From the beginning, I already saw her ending.”

They walked to the shopping center’s central plaza, about to exit. In the plaza’s center stood a life-sized bronze statue of an elder.

The elder was tall, with a straight back, sharp brows, and a commanding presence.

Bai Shikun immediately recognized it as his seventy-year-old self.

The stone tablet at the statue’s base noted this was the Bai family’s ancestor, Bai Shikun, and recorded his life story—yet there was no mention of Wang Rong, who had appeared in his life.

https://preview.redd.it/vtkfk1ra5kjg1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=8208e7fbc79a2fabebc86cb905a88cf919fc7085

Long’er giggled, “Shikun, your descendants really do miss you! Want to go say hi?”

Bai Shikun glared at his wife and said, annoyed, “If the mall’s theme is harmony with nature, why bother with personal idol worship? It’s totally out of place. Before we leave, I’m going to complain to management and get this eyesore removed!”

Long’er patted her husband’s back, “Alright, don’t be mad. Come! I’ll take you to the old street. You’ve never been to a poor district in your life—let me show you where I grew up!”



That night, a light fog settled over the city. Beneath the blurred, dazzling city lights, Long’er led Bai Shikun into the old street, gradually blending into the bustling crowd.

https://preview.redd.it/bdlzxu5e5kjg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=6271105c424bb94542bdbfad82d0435ece55e994

**Author’s Note:**

When I created the impoverished district where Long’er (the Madonna) appears, I actually based it on Sham Shui Po in Hong Kong.

The “Madonna Society” in the novel is modeled after the Sisters of the Precious Blood, who ran Tak Ching Secondary School and Primary School in Sham Shui Po (there’s indeed a Precious Blood Hospital there; Tak Ching Secondary has long closed, as for the primary school—I attended for two years and remember a Madonna statue in a corner of the playground, but I’m not sure if it’s still there…)

The apartment where Fang Ming and his wife live is modeled after the Sisters’ dormitory. Entering that complex really feels like stepping back in time! That’s why it left such an impression on me. I never expected it would become part of my story\^\^

1r51a6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1r51a6e/recovery_post_almost_2_years_in/,Recovery Post: Almost 2 Years In,"Very long post inbound. I promised I would come here when I finally get things under control and feel mostly good, so here it goes. Caveat: I wouldn't call myself 100%, but I'm back to living life the way that I was before all of this happened to me (aside from Drinking - I have drank since this happened, but didn't like feeling even worse than normal the next day haha. I also don't drink caffeine anymore - rarely even coffee even if it's Decaf). I've gotten promoted in my job (high stress, high functioning required job), gotten engaged, play golf, play soccer, gone to weddings, danced, gone on a boat, flown to Europe and was there for a week, driven 6+ hours on a trip, etc. all since this has happened. I believe that this could and should be considered ""Recovery"". Ironically, my post is the one that's pinned on the top of this subreddit asking what medication people used to get back to feeling relatively normal. I posted that in April of last year when I was still miserable. I've come a long way in just under a year and I think that you can too. I do consider myself to have Chronic Vestibular Migraine (or at one time, Chronic VM, but now it's probably just chronic symptoms I guess, idk)

I'll keep all of the ""important"" things at the top here and my journey underneath.

**Initial Symptoms:** 

1. Swaying/Rocking 
2. Brain Fog
3. Stuffy Ears
4. Light sensitivity 
4. heavy anxiety around crowds/busy scenes
5. tingling in hands and feet 
6. vision getting ""blurry"" or out of focus (this is a telltale sign that I'm having a migraine or about to have one is when my vision starts getting out of focus and it's harder to concentrate on things)

**Current Symptoms:** Obviously when I'm in a breakthrough migraine, the symptoms get worse, but for the most part they're taken care of.

1. Very minimal swaying/rocking - I primarily notice this if I look for it, but it's mainly in the background
2. some light sensitivity (grocery store, strobe lights, etc.)
3. a single eye floater that moves around when i move my eyes or head.
4. Ears crackle when I swallow for lack of a better term. They almost like pop or make a popping noise, I don't really know. It's weird. They get super loud when I'm sick with a cold or something.

**What Has Helped:** 

1. **Daily breathwork** - I use the Insight Timer app on my phone and have practiced 93 days in a row doing breathwork (I do any breathing that ""calms the nervous system""). This has helped tremendously and helps me outside of this sickness. I cannot empasize trying this enough. I practice once or twice a day either before work or before going to bed and it's helped me so much. I do think it takes time to see the dividends pay off, but worth it.
2. **Cupping** - taking tension away from my traps and upper back has helped a ton. Here are the cups that I use - cheap on Amazon and they've made a major impact to how I feel (find where I feel tight, rub with lotion, then place them on for 5-10 minutes max - drink a lot of water afterwards). 
3. **Medication** - obvious callout that a medication that works for me may not work for you. I am on Lamotrigine, Nortriptyline, Ajovy, and just got my 3rd round of Botox this week. I think the biggest difference maker for me has been the Lamotrigine, Ajovy, and Botox. It's important to stick with medication and see if it helps you - I know most the time people say 6-8 weeks, but really I'd say 3-4 months (not a doctor, just my opinion) is a good timeframe to see any positive effects.
4.  **Exercising** - Walking, Hiking, playing golf, playing soccer, riding peloton. Movement is great for your body when you have this disease. If you can do it and not focus on the symptoms and tell yourself that you are okay and even if you feel a little bit off balance you're going to be okay then it goes a long way. 
5. **Using AI to ask questions, get answers, and honestly, just to talk to ""someone"" that will always have a response.** - This one should be pretty self-explanatory. It's a strain on relationships when you can only talk about how shitty you feel. I used ChatGPT and Gemini to kind of vent honestly. I have instructions in my LLMs that keeps things realistic and doesn't always try to validate me which for me is helpful.
6. **Talking to people on this subreddit** - I have found several people on this subreddit who I've chatted with and messaged with who are there going through the same things as all of us. Some are more open and nicer than others for sure, but there have been plenty of people who I've talked with and have gained positive insight from in terms of ways that they have recovered/helped themselves too. Without them, I likely wouldn't be in the right frame of mind still while dealing with this. It's isolating, I totally get it. We might as well try to talk to the others that understand also.
7. **Avulux glasses** - I was very fortunate in that one of the people that I chatted with a lot about their recovery had an extra pair of Avulux glasses and they sent them to me. They are expensive otherwise, but I've found them to be extremely helpful, especially as I'm on computers a lot with my work. These are tinted glasses which help a lot with the light sensitivity.
8. **Getting a good neurologist/headache specialist** - If you can find a true headache specialist in your area - go to them over a normal neurologist. They'll understand more about mgiraines/headaches then a normal neurologist typically. If you don't have many good options I always tell people to look into Neurahealth. I've never used them, but there are neurologists that specialize in VM on their site. It is out of pocket for most people I believe which is a bummer, but if you don't really have any good doctors around you/ones that truly think you have VM then it's work checking out.
9. **Genesight test** This test was expensive like $330 out of pocket for me, but I think that it did help give insight into how my body interacts/metabolizes different medications. For example, it said that I may not absorb Lamotrigine as well as other medications, so because of that, I've been taking higher dosages of Lamotrigine than I was previously.

**Things that Maybe Help(ed)**

1. Massage - I get deep tissue massages. I'm sure it's a lot like the cupping, and while the massages obviously feel good in the moment, I actually don't know how good they make me feel from a vestibular perspective afterwards. They're also extremely expensive, so not really sustainable long-term.
2. Light Therapy - I tried greenlight therapy in these glasses for 20 minutes a day for awhile. I stopped in the winter because it's cold, lol, but will probably pick it back up here in the coming days as it gets a bit warmer. 
3. Physical Therapy on my Neck/Dry Needling - I did PT on my neck and a bunch of neck exercises. I think that it probably helped a little bit, but I don't know that my neck is the root cause of my dizziness. Dry needling in my neck was supposed to relieve tension as well. I didn't really feel much relief from it I don't think.
4. Lexapro - This was the first medication I tried for this, and I do think it helped qualm my anxiety for sure, but I don't think it did anything for my VM symptoms. I do think that if I were to take it or another SSRI(?) now, then it'd help the anxiety that comes with all of this for sure.
5. Reading - I've been reading a lot recently (like 30 minutes per night before bed) and I do think this helps train your eyes a little bit more also. 


**What did not help:** 

1. **NUCCA chiropractor** - complete scam, waste of money, and time. I wouldn't recommend that to anyone and wish I had never fallen for this scam. They sell false promises to people who would do anything to feel normal again and the lady I went to is a scummy rat that steals money from those who suffer. 
2. **Intense Vestibular Rehab Therapy** - most VRT therapy centers overdo it in my opinion. I went to a true vestibular therapist recently and the exercises she gave to me were much more gentle and subtle - real world movements mostly. Not things like standing on one leg on a foam pad with my eyes shut lol. The gentle therapy exercises certainly helped a lot. 
3. **Doom scrolling on this subreddit and Facebook pages** - it's easy to be super discouraged, trust me, I was there and still am there sometimes.  

**My next Step to Try to get back to 100%** - Continue all of the things have have helped me obviously, but there was a post here the other day talking about the effects of glucose on migrainers. I'm looking into that clinic and may pursue treatment from them just to see if I can get my migraine days per month as close to zero as possible. It'll probably be expensive, but would you pay $2-3,000 to feel almost normal again? I sure would and there's scientific evidence behind what they studied in their trials (unlike NUCCA for example).

* 
 

**Background:** 

This all started for me on April 9th, 2024. I was sitting at my desk (exactly where I am now) on a work call and all of the sudden, the world started spinning. After throwing up for about an hour, I had my fiancee take me to the ER where they said I'll be fine and just have a little bit of fluid behind my ears (lol). They gave me a shot in my butt and gave me Meclizine and said I should make an appointment with an ENT and sent me on my way.  

*   

The week after the attack and before I was able to get into an ENT, I still just felt completely ""off"". I didn't feel stable whatsoever when I walked, I couldn't think straight, and my left ear felt like it was completely stuffed up. I went to the ENT and they performed an audio test and looking at the structure of it and cleared my hearing, prescribed me some sort of flonase medication (didn't work at all) and suggested that I make an appointment with a vestibular specialist. I did this and two weeks later underwent all of the vestibular testing that's typically done (balance test, caloric testing (hot and cold air in my ears), etc. The doctor diagnosed me with Vestibular Neuritis and sent me on my way to Vestibular Rehab Therapy (the doctor was great and I have had several exchanges with him via email and phone since my initial diagnosis). I did VRT for like 3/4 months and felt like I plateaued. I was not consistently feeling good; however, I was having a couple of ""good"" days here and there. There was a lot of intense exercises that I think were probably too much for my vestibular system at the time. So this timeframe was May-August of 2024.

 * 

Around November 2024 I went to get a deep tissue massage (after mostly feeling decent for a little stretch) and for a week straight afterwards I was soooo dizzy. Like back to square one dizzy. I ended up reaching out to the vestibular testing doctor and he said it's possible because of blood flow or something like that but was like that's really interesting you should come back in and do a subset of tests. When I went back in, I no longer had a Vestibular Neuritis, but my testing suggested I could have some cervicogenic dizziness (coming from my neck). He said the routes I could go would either be physical therapy or chiropractic. I'd heard of NUCCA before, so that's the path I went down. I did that for about a month and then realized that after every adjustment, I'd leave feeling worse, so I quit that scam and did PT on my neck from December - April of 2025. In February of 2025, I decided to go to a spine expert and confirm nothing was wrong with my spine/upper cervical area - got an MRI and everything came back clean. Somehow (can't even remember how), I decided to go to a neurologist too. He ordered a MRI and MRA of my brain. I got them both done and they came back completely clean also, this left my neurologist to declare he thought I had vestibular migraine and he gave me nurtec as a preventative every 2 days. Nurtec didn't do anything for me and I wasn't convinced he was completely in the know about VM, so I sought out another neuro which is how I got to my now neuro and headache specialist.

* 

I did all sorts of initial testing with her also - cognitive testing, bloodwork, etc. to confirm that there was nothing else going on here and once all of that came back relatively normal she prescribed me Nortriptyline. I was on that for a little while and it wasn't really doing much for me, so I decided I wanted to try something else. I did a lot of research on possible medications that could help (using AI) and Lamotrigine seemed promising, I also wanted to try a CGRP medication and she said she likes prescribing Ajovy (she takes it herself also), so that's been the combination I've been on ever since. I then decided I wanted to get Botox too because I was still chasing that 100% feeling and I do think that Botox has helped for sure.

* 

I do still have symptoms today, but they're nowhere near as bad as they have been in the past. Like I mentioned up above, I'm going to look into the Glucose possibility and see if that's an avenue worth pursing for me, but only time will tell. Ironic I mentioned time there in my stream of consciousness because that's really the most important thing in this journey is time. Trust me, I know that it fucking sucks. It really fucking sucks. Especially when you feel like dogshit every day. I remember starting medication and being like oh my gosh I have to wait 8 weeks just to see if this is even doing anything for me when I already feel like shit and this may not even work and it was super depressing. Just grind it out and do what you can to get through. I know everyone has this at different levels, but push yourself to take a chance and go do something that you don't think you can do just to prove to yourself that you're okay and you can still do things! That can be as simple as walking around your neighborhood or going to the movies, or going to a restaurant and sitting in to eat, etc. I hoped and prayed that I'd be able to make this post one day and here I am one year later. I think if you stay positive and keep exploring every avenue to recovery, you can get here or close to it too. This isn't to say I'll never have a VM again, I'm sure that I will, but at least I know that they're only temporary and I'll be back to baseline in 3/4 days after them. When you get hit with worse symptoms, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're okay. Your body and mind will thank you. Feel free to comment or chat me with any comments or questions. Happy to help. -- BigHomie50",2,1771117345.0,VestibularMigraines,1,1.0,False

1r516eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicroFlow/comments/1r516eo/stop_eating_the_frog_seriously_start_eating_the/,Stop eating the frog. Seriously. Start eating the ice cream instead.,"I finally realized why I've been staring at the same IMPORTANT task for three days while my brain literally feels like it’s shutting down. We have all heard the classic productivity advice: ""Eat the frog"" do the hardest, ugliest thing first thing in the morning and the rest of your day will be a breeze.  
  
SPOILER ALTERT If I try to eat the frog first, I just spend six hours staring at the frog, feeling like a total failure, and then I end up on a Wikipedia deep dive about the history of the Apollo 11 moon landing (did you know they landed four miles off course? lol anyway, back to the point)

The problem isn't that we are lazy or unmotivated. It is that our brains don't actually care about (importance or consequences ;-;) in the same way neurotypical brains do. For us, trying harder isn't a solution. It is just more effective at making us feel like we are drowning (yep...)

The Motivation Flaw: Most productivity systems (like GTD or Inbox Zero) were built for neurotypical brains. They rely on a ""trust"" in your own brain that we just don't have yet. My brain doesn't care if a task is ""important."" It cares if it provides dopamine.

When we hit a point of overwhelm, our brains don't just ""power through."" They shut down. It feels like someone handed you a baby while you were already underwater. You can't breathe, and someone is tossing you more responsibilities.

The 4 C’s of ADHD Motivation: Instead of forcing the ""Frog,"" I’ve started looking for the Four C’s. This is how we actually get the engine moving:

Captivate: Is there a part of this project that is actually fascinating?

Create: Can I turn this boring task into a creative problem to solve?

Compete: Can I gamify this? (can I finish these five emails before the coffee finish brewing) got it??

Complete: Can I set a hard, urgent deadline that actually feels real!!

Strategies That Actually Work (For Now)

The biggest thing I've learned is to Embrace the Pivot. I used to feel so much shame when a new system or app stopped working after two weeks. Now, I just realize my brain is bored and needs novelty. That is okay. It didn't ""fail,"" it just finished its usefulness for that cycle.

A few things I’m trying this week: Eat the Ice Cream First: I do a task that I actually enjoy or find creative first. This builds the momentum. Once the ""train"" is moving, it is way easier to tackle the boring stuff.

Micro-Commitments: I’m not ""cleaning the kitchen."" I am putting exactly three dishes away. Usually, I do more, but if I only do three, I still ""won"" that goal.

Side Quests: If I'm stuck on a main project, I let myself take a ""side quest"" on a related, more interesting angle for 15 minutes. It sparks the brain back to life (mostly i like to keep a white sheet in the desk and write any sudden apperaance of those 1M dollars ideas lmaoo)

Stop blaming yourself for not being able to follow systems that weren't built for you. You aren't a broken neurotypical person, you just have an interest-based nervous system.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go finish those three dishes before I forget why I walked into the kitchen in the first place (';",1,1771117054.0,MicroFlow,0,1.0,False

The first time I saw her I opened the door to let her in class and she was so pretty I was physically stunned for a few seconds.  She smiled at me and sat in the seat in front of me in a class full of empty seats.  Every class i can catch her looking back at me a couple of times, but I cant tell if its a ""making sure this dude isnt staring at me"" look or actually looking at me.  I got put in a group project with just her and her friends a while ago. She makes me so nervous I can barely even look at her and I feel like shes picked up on it by now. But anytime I made a joke she would laugh and it made me feel amazing. When I said anything it felt like she was actually listening to what I had to say. 

I've only felt this way once and that ended up being the weirdest and most confusing situationship of my life. I really like this girl, and the last thing I would want to do is make her feel uncomfortable. I was planning on just going up after class and asking if she wanted to get coffee or lunch, but I feel like that's too much of an immediate yes-or-no. I was thinking that if I just ask her for her number it would give her time to think the things I said over, and it would be better for me to say what I actually mean without being as worried about her response.

- grind beans / level / tamp
- pull shots and steam milk
- dump puck immediately
- run water 1-2 seconds to clear group head
- put shot in cup
- pour milk and finish drink

His reasoning is that the grounds ""bake"" onto the group head if they're not dumped immediately. It's not like I let it sit there. I dump right after the drink is made.

Also, I prioritize making the drink because espresso shots oxidize (""die"") if they sit too long. (Our well-respected roaster suggests using within 20 seconds.) Moreover, steamed milk can cool off, lose a bit of texture, and separate if it sits.

If I'm pulling a quad, I'm not allowed to grind/level/tamp the two double shots, first. Instead, he wants me to:

- grind beans for shot #1 / level / tamp
- pull shot #1
- dump puck immediately
- run water 1-2 seconds to clear group head
- put shot #1 in cup
- grind beans for shot #2 / level / tamp
- pull shot #2 and steam milk
- dump puck immediately
- run water 1-2 seconds to clear group head
- put shot #2 in cup
- pour milk and finish drink

This is infuriatingly slow during a rush.

Again, the shots oxidize sitting in the cup (""die"") and the drinks turn out bitter. I know there's a healthy debate out there about whether or not this is true, but I can see the crema dissipate if it sits too long. And I can taste the difference, because it's hitting the back of my tongue (bitter) and not all over (balanced).

When I brought this up, he told me that it's better to have a finished shot sit, rather than grinding/leveling/tamping for two shots in advance. He says that while I'm grinding beans for the second shot, the beans for the first shot ""get exposed to the air"" and that ruins the flavor.

This makes no sense. All of the real chemistry happens during extraction, and after the shot is finished and the oils get exposed to cold air. The ground beans are only in the filter basket for about 15-20 seconds before they're used.

Also, regardless of where one stands on the shots die /don't die, I disagree that there's harm to the machine if I finish the drink, first. Then dump puck and run water.

After months of not seeing each-other and multiple hand outs cancelled last second, she asked me for a favor out of the blue. She asked me to get her a pregnancy test, since her car was broken and her bf is out of state. I did it out of care for her but deep down I felt absolutely used and hurt, but I didn’t want my feelings to affect this worrying moment for her. 

She soon after reached out to me saying she had to see me to vent, I agreed but once again she only reached out when she needed something. But even that time she cancelled the day of the meeting. I knew that something was going on and after confronting her about yet another cancellation, she told me her boyfriend had rap\*d her. And that she asked me for the favor in fear of being pregnant by him. 

I had never met him and knew that they were long distance and had finally met after months, although I wasn’t fond of the fact he was so far away I wasn’t happy she had someone. However, knowing that had happened honestly broke my heart and I was willing to go see her in a heart beat, as I myself know how unfortunate it is. She told me that she was experiencing denial about it and began to spiral which is why she had been acting out of character. I told her that I was always there for her and if she ever needed anyone, I was there. She confessed that this event had caused her to begin drinking and attend frat parties, mind you she has always been a very timid and anxious person. 

A few days later she told me about another SA that had happened shortly after her bf, that at a party she became really intoxicated and some dipshit took advantage of her (she never told me the details of what actually happened). She thankfully did make a police report about him, for which I was extremely proud of her for. I knew this was a rough time for her as she didn’t want to tell her parents about neither of the assaults. 

When she told me about her boyfriend assaulting her, I was under the impression that she had logically left him, she didn’t. She tried to assure me that she would and that she’s only using him right now as a form of revenge, however I did remind her that if she didn’t leave him that he wouldn’t face any consequences for his actions. 

Months after we finally see each-other again, to get a coffee and see a movie. Everything was going well until the actual movie, at which she texted her rapist boyfriend the whole time. I didn’t say anything until after the movie, asking her if they’re still together. She admitted that they are, and I asked why, to which she just said she really loves him. I confronted her about the hypocrisy of making a report about one guy but not the other, and she just said she knows how bad it is and that everyone is telling her that. We were supposed to hang out for the rest of the evening but apart of me couldn’t stomach what she said, and I went home. 

I texted her after saying that I care for her but I can’t support her dating a rapist to which she just replied that she understands. I honestly don’t know what to do; I care a lot about her and just cannot fathom the pain she’s experiencing but I cannot overlook her dating him…I fear that I may have come across very rude to her for ending our meeting so abruptly and in general for how I express myself about him. But I just don’t know how else to tell her that he isn’t worth it.

1r50z1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED_Gaming/comments/1r50z1c/pg27aqwpw_pixel_cleaning_behaviour/,PG27AQWP-W Pixel Cleaning Behaviour,"Hello everyone. I recently got the PG27AQWP-W and have previously been using a PG32UCDM for some time. I love both displays very much, but noticed a strange behaviour in the PG27AQWP-W that is not observed on the PG32UCDM.

On the PG27AQWP-W, on Performance Mode which allows you to adjust saturation and other settings, it appears that **any** time the monitor is either turned off (via 2 button clicks), or the monitor goes into standby mode, the panel will run a pixel cleaning cycle. By this, I mean that as long as the monitor has been on for any amount of time, and it is turned off or I'm stepping away for a bit and it goes into standby mode, the monitor will run pixel clean even if it's only been on for a few minutes. The pixel clean cycle count does go up and and time since last cleaning resets to 0h.

What is commonly accepted is that pixel cleaning should only be ran every 4-8 hours, and they will gradually wear out the panel as the function aims to distribute wear evenly, which prolongs the panel's overall lifespan. This behaviour seems counterproductive, because it results in far too many cleaning cycles far too quickly.

It seems that the PG27AQDM also had this issue as there were various threads on the ASUS forums and at least one on Reddit that I have found, and no one seems to have a definitive answer. ASUS, for the most part, appears to just asks users to refer to the manual or shrug it off without even acknowledging the potential issue.

I could not find for the life of me if this is indeed intended behaviour, or there is in fact a software/firmware issue. The most disheartening thing is, this appears to have been going on for at least 2 years now as a simple Google search will result in threads and discussions asking about this exact issue with the PG27AQDM going back as far as 2 years. Evidently, this same thing is still present on the PG27AQWP-W.

One ASUS representative did respond in one thread that if you use Power Saving Mode, then this is not the case. I did try this, and indeed although every time the monitor is powered back on again it will remind you to run a pixel cleaning cycle, the pixel cleaning cycle count is not going up each time the monitor turns off, and the total usage hours is not resetting unless I manually run a pixel cleaning cycle, say every 8 hours. However, when using this mode, you are locked out of HDR (if you enable HDR in Windows, the monitor automatically changes into Performance Mode) and you also are locked out of all ""Image"" settings such as saturation.

Lastly, this has never been an issue on my PG32UCDM, which is a QD-OLED and I did notice that both the PG27AQDM and PG27AQWP-W are WOLED panels, I wondered if this is just how ASUS WOLED panels are? My particular PG32UCDM actually appears to have the opposite issue, where the monitor does not trigger automatic pixel cleaning, even after 8+ hours of use and it goes into standby or is turned off. This wasn't really a big problem, because I can just go make a coffee or something and let it run its cleaning cycle when the reminder pops up every 8 hours and was largely harmless to me.

For such high-end, flagship displays commanding a high premium, this is rather disappointing to see it continue unresolved and seemingly even unrecognized by ASUS.

So of course we went!

I pet the animals, fed them, and had a great time not worrying about germs or feeling sick or anything of the sort. No meds, no safety behaviors, nothing.

Thankfully afterwards though, I did have some rubbing alcohol in my purse in a spray bottle so we could clean our hands because that’s just common sense. Then I gave them a good wash when I got home. So no worries about that! That’s something someone without emet would do too.

I also got to see my mom and she gave me some valentine’s chocolate! And the barista at the coffee place gave me some sweet gummy candy on my straw and on a stick that said “be mine” in my drink!

Now for my romantic valentine’s date with my fiance later tonight! Best day EVER!

But first, I need to pay the animal photo tax. Don’t think I would deprive you guys of that!

Happy Valentine’s Day everyone! Have the best day with minimal anxiety, and no tummy troubles! 🖤

Day 10 — Carnival Edition

Today was the first day of Carnival, and I slowly made my way down from the apartment to see the opening parade.

By slowly,I mean I was passed by several elderly women, one determined raccoon, and multiple moms herding children while carrying snacks, backpacks, and the emotional weight of the day.

At my current pace, a snail could win a foot race with me.

But it was worth it.

The costumes and polleras were stunning bright colors, intricate details, and pure celebration everywhere. Panama knows how to party.

I rewarded my efforts with a raspa ice topped with cream and vanilla syrup. Probably not doctor-recommended, but after smelling all the incredible food and feeling my stomach stage a protest, it felt like the perfect treat and an energy boost for the six-block journey back uphill.

Healing, Carnival, and shaved ice a surprisingly excellent combination.

Panama, you are beautiful.

Day 11 — The Apartment & The Microwave

Today I moved apartments.

No view. No Carnival music. Mild disappointment… but also enjoying the peace. Turns out healing pairs well with quiet.

I arrived early and my apartment and I use that term generously was not ready. So I left my bags and walked a couple blocks for a Panamanian geisha coffee.

If you have never tried geisha coffee and you love coffee, it is absolutely worth the price. Smooth, floral, magical. A warm hug in a cup.

I am extremely glad I pre-cooked all my food at the last apartment because this kitchen appears to have been designed by Fisher-Price.

Except the microwave.

Somehow they installed it on a shelf so high the top touched the ceiling. There is no universe in which I could reach it… even if I didn’t have stitches in my abdomen.

I messaged the owner asking for a step stool.

She and the housekeeper arrived and, after confirming there was no stool to be found, decided to lower the microwave themselves.

Neither of them was five feet tall… yet still taller than me at my current compressed height of 4’10” (and 4’8” by evening swelling).

One climbed onto a barstool while the other tried to keep it from rotating like a carnival ride. The cord was literally plugged in near the ceiling.

After strategic maneuvering and the use of kitchen tongs to unplug it, success was achieved.

The microwave now lives on a small folding TV tray.

I immediately ordered food delivery. Lol

However, I now feel morally obligated to use it tomorrow to heat my lunch and dinner.

Healing continues.

Mobility improving.

Coffee secured.

Microwave relocated.

Recovery builds patience.

Panama builds character.

How should i fix this next time?"", often asking me subtly for coffee which we would get from a nearby cafe. Our hands would brush ""accidentally"" too. He frequently compliments me and notices my small changes.

But he can go days to a week without batting an eye to me, occasionally he would come in the class pissed and slam his things down and will refuse to talk to me. Other times we would cross paths on campus and he would literally just walk away and scoff.

The longest time out of a crash I've had on the last few months has been 6 days but mostly only 3 or 4 before a new crash. 

The first fresh week out with the Visible app and Polar Loop I did 7 days, 7 food days , before a heavy crash because I started to believe I was done. you know the score. 

So dead early days but it's really helpful at letting me know how easy it is to exert on bad days. It's very revealing about what's my body doing on these days and how little I actually need to do. np cheeky laundry on day 3, no popping out for a coffee. reat rest rest and day 4 I can see my HR is much lower and steady with mild activity, 2 more days of mindful chores and I'm up to baseline. 

Still early days but I'm prob 30-40 treatments/supplements+ docs in by now and this is a tiny spec of white light down my long dark tunnel.

Mermaid Anatomy

The top half is human, and the bottom is that of a fish—as usual—but with key differences:

They have webbed hands, no fingernails, and four gills beneath their chin.

They have four breasts on their chest instead of two.

Their tails are dull grey, not the bright colors of myth.

A fin runs along the human back, with two smaller fins on each side of the tail, and the tail fin at the end forms a sharp V-shape.

The tail is smooth, not scaly.

Their faces are uncanny—not beautiful, but haunting.

Their dark eyes seem to absorb light rather than reflect it.

They have sharp teeth for eating meat. A forked tongue that seemed to serve no obvious purpose. two slits instead of a human nose.

Their long, dark hair behaves more like seaweed than real hair.

Two pronged Graaf on Males

One or peeing. One for mating.

Both for Greetings.

On average, they are 7 feet 8 inches long (from head to tail).

They move rapidly and unpredictably, like small fish, not the graceful beings of storybooks.

They can make sharp 180-degree turns within a second.

They usually swim at 6 miles per hour, but can reach a top speed of 30 mph when fleeing or hunting.

A Fahteel can ceace if it's too painful or too tiring for the mama

They Give Birth in shallow waters

Usually only about 5 or 6 feet form the shore.

Sometimes Fahteel takes a bit. Labor is too much. They can't move until the Bloof is out.  Muscles lock. The Blood basically fills the whole Birth Canal. Which runs along the whole tail. And All the focus is on Pushing. Escape is NEVER the priority.

Some Mothers Die during Fahteel. Not because of the process itself. Just the location of the process.

One. It's instinct to Give Birth at the shore.

Two. The Bloofs have to LEARN to swim. They awkwardly flail. If they fall. The sand is only about 2 feet below them. If it was Deep water. There's a huge chance they'd just sink and die with nothing to catch them. (No gill flow = no breathing= Death)

Three. The shore is far From the big predators like Dolphins or Sharks.

A bloof stops breastfeeding at 10 months old 

A bloof matures at age 5

Interesting fact

Mermaids are incapable of seeing the colors Yellow and Orange

They can see blue green pink purple black white and red.

Mermaids – Foods to Avoid (Deadly or Sickening)

Chocolate / candy → death

Pineapple → death (unknown cause)

Alcohol → death

Caffeinated drinks (coffee, energy drinks, most sodas) → illness

Processed human snacks (chips, fast food, sugary cereals) → severe digestive distress

Dairy (milk, cheese, ice cream) → sickness, nausea

Most grains beyond bread (rice, pasta, crackers in large amounts) → digestive upset

Artificial sweeteners → toxic in moderate amounts

Ceahaw Mermaids – Special Notes During Pregnancy

Stomach sensitivity increases dramatically → foods normally tolerated may now cause sickness.

Avoid any of the deadly foods above. Even small amounts can be fatal.

Fruits and bread are generally safe, but careful portioning is important.

Meats must be fresh and unseasoned – overly salty or spiced meat may cause nausea or distress.

Human Foods Mermaids Can Eat

Fruits (without seeds) → bananas, apples, pears, blueberries, melons

Bread → plain, no added sugar or preservatives

Meat → steak, chicken, pork, fish (fresh or lightly cooked, unsalted or unseasoned)

Vegetables → carrots, peas, leafy greens (mostly safe, mild digestion)

There are actually more ways to earn a mermaid's trust besides a spread/rub

The most foolproof is the Spread/rub. Safe. Predictable.

Offering food. Almost perfect. But sometimes they don't want any. Either because they're not hungry. Or if they don't Like what you have them

The next is Saving them

As seen with Ehakaj. Nicole and Molly helped her get back to the  water. She was ok with them

Saving a mermaid is a tricky thing though. They often misinterpret what you're trying to do.

Next up. Helping during Fahteel.

Could also be misunderstood for aggression

Things that will get you hurt or killed

Refusing a spread/rub    (already explained)

Moving towards a bloof (1 minute to 1 year old) without permission (Have to spread/rub the parent's and the baby's Groof or graaf before any other contact)  then you can play or pet them

Things that WILL end you:

Nonconsensual belly touch.

Hurting a Bloof (1 minute to 8 months old)

""cucucucucucucucucucucu""

That sound? No matter how many times you spread or rub. You're gone!",0,1771115087.0,SpeculativeEvolution,0,0.5,False

Since purchasing it I’ve repotted it into a much bigger pot, given it fresh soil and some liquid fertiliser and have kept it indoors next to a south facing window.

However I’ve noticed that it’s slowly been getting less and less healthy, the top leaves are always facing down and slightly wilted and look less green (previously they were bright and glossy, now darker and dry/matte looking). The bottom leaves have also become brown and crunchy.

I water it once every 10 days or so and the soil is never kept damp for too long, and given its fresh soil with fertiliser I don’t think nutrients is the issue. Is it just because it’s indoors?

But I was lying in bed last night thinking of the greater Christendom as a ""symphony"" of sorts.... which led me to thinking of individual denominations as different sections of the orchestra. 

I thought about it a little more and this is what I think:

**The Catholic Church: The Pipe Organ**

Beautiful, sophisticated, and massive. Was unquestionably the main character for over a thousand years until other instruments showed up and started demanding chairs. Still thinks of itself as the backbone of the whole operation, and honestly, it kind of is - the architecture of the concert hall was literally built around it. Can be breathtaking or absolutely overwhelming depending on who's at the keys. Has more stops and registers than anyone fully understands, including many of the people playing it. Vatican II was basically when someone finally said ""maybe we don't need to use every stop at once.""

**The Orthodox Churches: The Oboe**

The instrument the entire orchestra tunes to, and they will never let you forget it. Has been playing this exact same part, with virtually no variation, since the 4th century, and considers this a point of pride rather than a limitation. The tone is ancient, haunting, and achingly beautiful - but also kind of nasal, and it's definitely an acquired taste. Claims, with arguable justification, that the pipe organ split off from *them* and not the other way around. Views everything written after the Great Schism as essentially fan fiction. The oboist has a magnificent beard.

**Mainline Protestants: The String Quartet**

Taking the place of the organ when the organ doesn't seem quite right. Articulate, intellectually serious, they read the sheet music, but are also the ones most willing to ""interpret"" it to fit more modern musical arrangements. They're the ones often the ones progressing the music forward into new territory - sometimes into territory the rest of the orchestra isn't sure counts as music anymore.

*The United Methodist Church: The Upright Bass.* Steady, holds the rhythm together. Not flashy, not trying to be. Shows up, does the work, keeps the ensemble grounded. Currently in the middle of a very painful argument about whether to re-tune.

*The PCUSA: The Cello.* Rich, sophisticated, and a little snobby about it. Feels chosen. Has a graduate degree in music theory and will work it into conversation. Plays beautifully but sometimes seems more interested in debating the score than performing it.

*The Episcopal/Anglican Church: The Violin.* Deep respect for tradition, occasionally leads the way. Can go from a Bach partita to something avant-garde without blinking. Somehow manages to be both high-church and progressive simultaneously, which shouldn't work but kind of does. Drinks wine at rehearsal and nobody questions it.

*The ELCA: The Viola.* The middle way of the mainline denominations. Does important harmonic work that nobody notices. Gets made fun of by the other strings, takes it with good humor. Brought the casserole.

**The Baptists: The Brass Section (Trumpets and Trombones)**

Loud, confident, and absolutely certain they're carrying the melody even when they're drowning everyone else out. 

*The SBC* is first trumpet - thinks they're the concertmaster, will tell you so, and has opinions about what the rest of the orchestra should be wearing. 

*Independent Baptists* are the guy who brought his own trumpet from home, refuses to read the sheet music, sits in the back corner, and insists he sounds better than everyone. Has started three separate orchestras after disagreements about tempo. 

*The Black Baptist* tradition is genuinely the most musically gifted section of the entire orchestra - everyone knows this, nobody says it enough, and half the techniques the other sections use were quietly borrowed from them.

**The PCA/EPC/LCMS: The French Horn Section**

Noble, beautiful when played well, but famously difficult and prone to cracking at the worst possible moment. Thinks of itself as the most sophisticated voice in the brass section and quietly resents being seated near the trumpets. Deeply traditional, insists on playing from the original score, and gets genuinely upset when the strings start improvising. 

*The LCMS* is the principal horn - convinced they have the purest tone in the building. 

*The PCA* is second horn - Reformed and they need you to know about it. 

*The EPC* is third horn - basically the PCA but less intense about it, which drives the PCA crazy. More willing to play modern ensembles  
  
**Non-Denominational Evangelicals: The Percussion Section**

Lots of weird, whimsical instruments that often feel out of place - a rain stick here, a djembe there, timpani's, glockenspiels.... someone who showed up with a cajon. They will follow along with the sheet music, but only read the parts they like. They're loud and they become the focus when they play, which is both their gift and their curse. A good percussionist makes the whole orchestra better. A bad one makes everyone in the audience think symphonic music was a mistake. Currently the fastest-growing section and very excited about it. Their music stand has a coffee cup from a church with an hipster-looking logo on it.

**The Pentecostals: The Tuba**

Has a legitimate role in the orchestra and can actually anchor the low end beautifully when they're disciplined. But let's be honest - it's hard to take the tuba seriously as a featured instrument. Every now and then the tubist stands up for a solo and half the audience is moved and the other half is trying not to laugh. Occasionally makes sounds that don't seem to correspond to any known note, and insists this is a feature, not a bug.

**The Assemblies of God: The Clarinet**

More polished than the tuba, and genuinely talented - can play with real technical skill and emotional depth when they want to. But every so often they hit this bizarre squeaky overtone and the whole orchestra tenses up. Sits close enough to the brass that outsiders lump them together, which annoys them to no end. Desperately wants the strings to take them seriously. Has a surprisingly large youth program.

**The Mennonites/Anabaptists: The Flute**

Gentle, pure-toned, and a little otherworldly. You forget they're in the orchestra sometimes, and then they come in with something so crystalline and beautiful it makes you wonder why everyone else is so loud. Deeply committed to their part but would never in a million years fight for a solo. Brought homemade bread to rehearsal and it was the best thing anyone has ever eaten. The rest of the orchestra secretly admires them but would never actually adopt their lifestyle. Rode a bicycle to the concert hall.

**The Quakers: The Rest (Musical Silence)**

Technically part of the score. Arguably the most important part of any great piece of music. But they just sit there. In silence. Waiting. Occasionally someone in the silence feels moved to play a single, unaccompanied note, and honestly, it's usually the most profound thing in the entire concert. The rest of the orchestra doesn't quite know what to do with them but quietly suspects they might be the most musical people in the room. Didn't bring an instrument. Didn't need one.

**The Seventh-Day Adventists: The Harp**

Beautiful in its own right, genuinely angelic tone, but insists on playing in a slightly different time signature than the rest of the orchestra. Shows up on Saturday when rehearsal is on Sunday and acts like everyone else got the schedule wrong. Keeps leaving pamphlets on the other musicians' stands about how the conductor is coming back very soon and everyone else is reading the score incorrectly. Has weirdly specific and strongly held opinions about what the other musicians should be eating at the post-rehearsal dinner. 

**The Mormons: The Electric Guitar**

Seems out of place and nobody's entirely sure how it fits into symphonic music, but it's new, and distinctly American. Built its own amplifier. The rest of the orchestra keeps debating whether it technically counts as an orchestral instrument or if it's doing something else entirely. Has a very clean-cut appearance and its own book of sheet music that it claims is a supplement to the original score. Will walk around to other sections to explain why the electric guitar was actually God's plan all along.

**The Churches of Christ - The Main Choir**

*The Churches of Christ  -* Filed a noise complaint. Filed a second noise complaint specifically about the percussion section. Has a blog about how instruments aren't in the original score and therefore constitute an unauthorized addition. Will only accept a cappella performance and considers even a pitch pipe to be a slippery slope. Left a certified letter with the building manager claiming the building wasn't zoned for musical instruments.

Actually sound incredible when they're in four-part harmony, which makes it even more annoying that they won't stop side-eyeing everyone else's instrument cases. Views the percussion section as a sign of civilizational decline. Has walked out of at least one rehearsal because someone hummed along to the tuning note. Genuinely believes the orchestra would be better if everyone else would simply put their instruments down.

**The AME Church - The Gospel Choir**

*The AME Church -* Was here before half the orchestra showed up, built their own rehearsal hall when the main one wouldn't let them in, and has been carrying the emotional and spiritual weight of the entire concert ever since. When the gospel choir comes in, every other section instinctively knows to either support or get out of the way. The theological depth is real, the musical tradition is unmatched, and the soprano section alone could bring the whole audience to its feet. Has contributed more to American music than most of the orchestra combined and received approximately none of the credit. The pipe organ borrowed from them. The brass section borrowed from them. The percussion section *definitely* borrowed from them. Still shows up every single week with more grace and power than the rest of the ensemble deserves. The conductor should be taking notes.

**The New Apostolic Reformation/Prosperity Gospel: The Guy with a Vuvuzela**

Not a real instrument. Not part of the orchestra. Was not invited. Showed up anyway in a USA-flag-covered vest, claimed God told him in a dream that he's actually the new conductor, and started blowing as loud as physically possible during the most delicate passage of the evening. Has a surprising number of followers in the audience who think this is what music was always supposed to sound like. Currently trying to get the orchestra renamed, ban women from performing, petitioning the city council to declare the vuvuzela the official instrument of the municipality, and lobbying to have the concert hall draped in red-white-and-blue bunting. If you ask him to stop - or even to tone it down down - he'll claim you're under demonic influence, that the Founding Fathers intended all orchestras to be vuvuzela-forward, and that George Washington's favorite instrument was, in fact, the vuvuzela. Has a theo-bro themed podcast. Has a prophecy. Has a PAC. The rest of the orchestra is genuinely alarmed but can't figure out how he got a microphone.

When I was at primary school in the UK, I was the skinniest in the class, and when I was 15-16, I decided to do something about it. At that time, there were regular ads for Charles Atlas' course in the papers. You could change from a weakling to a muscle man! So, unknown to my parents, I ordered his course and started doing the exercises. There was also dietary advice - milk good, tea and coffee bad. The bad thing was, it didn't seem to make much difference to my physique (maybe only the second skinniest in the class now). The good thing was, I kept up the exercises, and I think they've helped me remain fit (but not muscular) all my life.

I don't know if Mr. Atlas really got his muscular body from those exercises, diet, etc. (maybe he secretly took anabolic steroids) but it didn't do him much good in later life. I note that he died more than ten years younger than my parents were when they died, and they didn't do any exercises and drank lots of tea and coffee.

So, I try to have a fairly healthy lifestyle, but not extreme. Jollibee and McDonalds food sometimes, exercises but not every day. What about you? ",1,1771113907.0,TruePhilippinesExpats,1,1.0,False

1r4zzm2,https://i.redd.it/gwhh7j6hujjg1.jpeg,The Story of Tea,"In ancient times, tea was not known outside China. Rumours of its existence had reached the wise and the unwise of other countries, and each tried to find out what it was in accordance with what he wanted or what he thought it should be.

The King of Inja ('here') sent an embassy to China, and they were given tea by the Chinese Emperor. But, since they saw that the peasants drank it too, they concluded that it was not fit for their royal master: and, furthermore, that the Chinese Emperor was trying to deceive them, passing off some other substance for the celestial drink.

The greatest philosopher of Anja ('there') collected all the information he could about tea, and concluded that it must be a substance which existed but rarely, and was of another order than anything then known. For was it not referred to as being a herb, a water, green, black, sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet?

In the countries of Koshish and Bebinem, for centuries the people tested all the herbs they could find. Many were poisoned, all were disappointed. For nobody had brought the tea-plant to their lands, and thus they could not find it. They also drank all the liquids which they could find, but to no avail.

In the territory of Mazhab ('Sectarianism') a small bag of tea was carried in procession before the people as they went on their religious observances. Nobody thought of tasting it: indeed, nobody knew how. All were convinced that the tea itself had a magical quality. A wise man said: 'Pour upon it boiling water, ye ignorant ones!' They hanged him and nailed him up, because to do this, according to their belief, would mean the destruction of their tea. This showed that he was an enemy of their religion. Before he died, he had told his secret to a few, and they managed to obtain some tea and drink it secretly. When anyone said: 'What are you doing?' they answered: 'It is but medicine which we take for a certain disease.'

And so it was throughout the world. Tea had actually been seen growing by some, who did not recognize it. It had been given to others to drink, but they thought it the beverage of the common people. It had been in the possession of others, and they worshipped it. Outside China, only a few people actually drank it, and those covertly.

Then came a man of knowledge, who said to the merchants of tea, and the drinkers of tea, and to others: 'He who tastes, knows. He who tastes not, knows not. Instead of talking about the celestial beverage, say nothing, but offer it at your banquets. Those who like it will ask for more. Those who do not, will show that they are not fitted to be tea-drinkers. Close the shop of argument and mystery. Open the teahouse of experience.'

The tea was brought from one stage to another along the Silk Road, and whenever a merchant carrying jade or gems or silk would pause to rest, he would make tea, and offer it to such people as were near him, whether they were aware of the repute of tea or not. This was the beginning of the Chaikhanas, the teahouses which were established all the way from Peking to Bokhara and Samarkand. And those who tasted, knew.

At first, mark well, it was only the great and the pretended men of wisdom who sought the celestial drink and who also exclaimed: 'But this is only dried leaves!' or: 'Why do you boil water, stranger, when all I want is the celestial drink?', or yet again: 'How do I know what this is? Prove it to me. Besides the colour of the liquid is not golden, but ochre!'

When the truth was known, and when the tea was brought for all who would taste, the roles were reversed, and the only people who said things like the great and intelligent had said were the absolute fools. And such is the case to this day.

\[Comment:\]

Drinks of all kinds have been used by almost all peoples as allegories connected with the search for higher knowledge. Coffee, the most recent of social drinks, was discovered by the dervish sheikh Abu el-Hasan Shadhili, at Mocha in Arabia. Although the Sufis and others often clearly state that 'magical drinks' (wine, the water of life) are an analogy of a certain experience, literalist students tend to believe that the origin of these myths dates from the discovery of some hallucinogenic or inebrietive quality in potations. According to the dervishes, such an idea is a reflection of the investigator's incapacity to understand that they are speaking in parallels. This tale is from the teachings of the Master Hamadani (died 1140) teacher of the great Yasavi of Turkestan.

Not all at once and not dramatically, but enough that things stopped collapsing for the protesters. Arrests still happened, but bail money appeared. Protesters came home quickly,  with legal aid already waiting. Community workers stayed in the streets longer, and were able to move freely with transit passes tucked into pockets and bags. Meetings continued past the point they usually broke, past the hour when someone always had to leave for a second shift or a late bus. If someone lost their job under pressure, clinics still provided medicine. Food pantries stayed stocked. Childcare remained safe and accessible. Rent was paid. Lights stayed on.

No one was paid to resist, rather they were paid to live and that distinction mattered.

At first, the change registered as small mercies, like a pharmacy that stayed open late, a legal hotline that answered on the second ring or a landlord who suddenly accepted a payment plan without threats. People began to notice that the worst outcomes were no longer automatic.

They could breathe, pause and think about how to keep going.

Government attention arrived first as curiosity, then as concern and then memos that used Faye’s alias too often to be coincidence. Agencies asked questions no one could quite justify. Banks flagged transfers that had already cleared, and her foundations received calls suggesting coordination, influence, or foreign involvement, but nothing illegal was found. That was the problem for those who were concerned.

Faye had complied with everything. She had hired accountants, lawyers,  and auditors who spoke gently and billed mercilessly. She filed forms before deadlines and answered inquiries with patience and documentation. She learned quickly. She learned that money did not need to be loud to be effective, that legitimacy was its own currency and that the law moved slowly, until it became frightened. 

The first attempt to freeze a fund came quietly, experimentally. Her attorneys responded within the hour. There were no responding accusations, just records, receipts, and timestamps, so the freeze was lifted.

The second attempt arrived disguised as concern for national stability.

This time, Faye asked a question.

“Which statute,” she said pleasantly, “have I violated?”

There was a pause.

No response was offered.

By the time her name reached the higher floors, the ones with sealed windows and secure elevators, it was already too late to erase her. She had not bought obedience, nor bribed officials. She had not commanded crowds or paid protesters and she had not broken a single law. She had done something far worse. She had made resistance sustainable, and somewhere, deep in a place she did not examine too closely, Faye felt the brooch warm against her skin. Not with magic, but with human desire and attention and  possibility.

This, she understood now, was how human power worked.

Not by force but by making things possible.



On Tuesday morning, Maribel, a mom that worked an entry level job did not go to work. It was not a strike and no one had told her to stay home. No one had paid her to refuse to go in. Her son had been arrested the night before, swept up with a group standing outside a courthouse. He was nineteen and  worked at a car wash. He had never been arrested before. Normally, this was where everything would have collapsed because she would have missed work and would have lost the shift. The manager would have sighed and said we need reliable people. The rent would have come due anyway and fear would have done the rest.

Instead, Maribel drank coffee and waited.

The legal clinic answered on the second ring. They already had her son’s name.

“Yes,” the woman said. “We’re aware. He’s being processed. Bail is covered.”

Maribel sat down hard in the kitchen chair. Covered. By noon, she had a text telling her where to pick him up. By two, he was home, exhausted and quiet, eating soup from a jar someone had handed him when he was released.

She washed his jacket while he slept and packed a few leftovers into containers for tomorrow’s lunch. She sat at the table and stared at the wall for a long time, letting her hands stop shaking.

“Are you going back tomorrow?” he asked when he woke.

She thought about it. She thought about the rent paid this month and about the childcare voucher waiting in her email. She thought about the bus pass in her purse and about the clinic that had refilled her inhaler without asking for a co-pay.

“Yes,” she said. “But not today.”

That afternoon, she walked back to the courthouse.

She did not chant or yell or  block the door. She stood with a group of people who were not being disruptive but who were also not leaving. They talked softly and shared snacks. Someone watched the kids. A woman approached Maribel and offered her a part-time job, one with enough flexibility to keep showing up, and enough money to cover the bills. Maribel accepted on the spot.

More people arrived.

Some brought folding chairs. Someone passed out oranges and another shared coffee from a thermos.  A man who worked nights took over for a woman who had to leave. The group shifted and rearranged itself, making room without being asked.

They were not dramatic but they were persistent.

The building loomed and inside, someone made a note.

And outside, for the first time in a long while, people stayed.

Description:

In SCRAPS, you start each day with a fixed tray of 30 letter tiles. You're then given a series of incomplete 4-letter words. You have to use the tiles to form a word before moving to the next. Everyone globally gets the same tiles and faces the same 4-letter patterns in the same order. Your goal is to complete as many words as possible with the given tiles.

The Strategy:

It’s a casual optimizer. You might find a great word for the first pattern, but if it uses up all your 'A's and 'E's early, you’ll struggle to finish the later rounds. The goal isn't just to find words, it's to manage your ""Scraps"" to see how far you can go.

Daily Seed: The word patterns and letter tiles reset and midnight local.

Stats: Compare your score against the global distribution chart.

We’re currently based in South Wales. My wife and I have always dreamed of a quieter, simpler, more minimal lifestyle. Safe to say city life isn’t really for us. We already live pretty quietly and keep ourselves to ourselves. Personally, if I can take the dog for a long rural walk and enjoy a hot cup of coffee afterwards, I’m happy. That’s me sorted. Safe to say I can foresee a very cheap retirement ahead of me.

We’re not big on travelling, I’m aware it’s not exactly cheap getting from the island to the mainland, etc. We’ve never even been on holiday as a couple or as a family. I don’t order much online either, just as and when needed.

We have two young children, one of which is autistic. The frustrating part is that he's so young it is hard to pinpoint the extent or severity of his needs. It is safe to say he is not the most severe case, but he is also not the mildest case ever either. He is nonverbal (possibly preverbal). Ironically, he's the noisiest little guy you could meet considering he doesn't speak. Currently, the promising thing is that he is interested in numbers & it does seem like he's trying to count from 1 to 10.

We already live a fairly isolated life, we don’t really have much of a social circle, and we don’t see family all that often either. That side of things doesn’t worry us one bit. Weirdly, we might see people more if they came to visit or vice versa.

Before we seriously consider relocating, obviously, we'd need to make sure we have an extended stay, just to get a real feel of day-to-day life. But right now, I'd also love it if someone could provide more insights to the support my son may potentially need. What does that look like in Shetland?

* What is the school support like?
* Is there a basic level of speech therapy available locally?
* Are there dedicated provisions or specialist units?
* How do families generally find the support available & on offer?

We’re under no illusion that we’d find world-class services in a remote location. At the same time, support where we are hasn’t exactly set a high bar, in all honesty, we currently get sweet FA in terms of support & whatnot. We’re simply trying to get a realistic picture before making any major decisions.

I bought two bags of this Ethiopian blend, expecting a typical Ethiopian washed profile. It’s only 2 weeks off roast (5 weeks recommended) but I’m out of coffee and made some up (1:17, TWW, Pulsar, 91°). First concern: I smelled the carafe and it had a little funk, not bad, but obvious. Second concern: it is cloyingly sweet and reminds me of a co-ferment. That sweetness is unwelcome after a few sips and it lasts all day. Some florals, but it reminds me more of a co-ferment.

Buried in the multiple paragraphs about the farmer is a mention that it is honey processed. There were multiple mentions of “wet” processing, but I incorrectly assumed it was washed. I’ve had honey and natural processed beans from other roasters and didn’t get this overbearing sweetness, nor did they taste like a certain popular co-ferment.

Will this gross sweetness and banal cakey-ness ameliorate with age or is this just the nature of the beast?

I tested onsite. One thing I wasn't expecting is that I had to put my stuff in a locker but could not access the locker on breaks; my water and snack bar had to be put on a table.

1. Put enough gas in your car ahead of time. On the way isn't a great time for an unplanned stop.
2. Sunglasses. It was dark when I left the house. Wish I had these when I got out 4 hours later.
3. Wear your hair up; otherwise, you have to lift it up every time you enter or reenter the room, and it's one more step.
4. Avoid a hooded sweatshirt; they make you shake out the hood every time.
5. Layered clothing. I'm usually cold but the test room was warm.
6. A shirt and pants that show wrists and ankles will prevent you from having to roll up your sleeves or pat down your legs each entry. Bonus if the pants are leggings without pockets as those had to be turned inside out each time.
7. Glasses wipe for smudges. Left it by my water since I couldn't access the locker on breaks.
8. Snack bar.
9. Coffee; they had water available.
10. The noise cancelling headphones they had were awful. They were super heavy and the headband wouldn't stay in place. They had offered foam ear plugs before I went in, but I don't like in-ear options so I declined. I got some foam ones on my break because the over the ear were painful.

After months of ""should I, shouldn't I?"" and a nagging voice in my head screaming about how expensive a whole month in Europe would be, I booked the flight to Portugal. Everyone talks about the dream of solo travel, but nobody *really* lays out the nitty-gritty of how to make it happen without selling a kidney. I was convinced I’d blow my budget in a week. Turns out, I was dead wrong.

Here’s my honest takeaway from 30 days of solo wandering through Portugal, and how it was genuinely way more affordable than I (or anyone I know) expected:

My biggest discovery wasn't just how much I loved the freedom of choosing my own path each day, but how shockingly far my budget stretched. Before I left, I braced myself for at least €2,500-€3,000 for a month, excluding flights. What I actually spent, with a mix of smart choices and a few splurges, came in significantly lower.

**The Real Numbers & Where I Went (A Month Breakdown):**

*   **Total Time:** 30 days (mid-May to mid-June)
*   **Destinations:** Lisbon (10 days), Porto (7 days), Coimbra (3 days), Lagos (7 days), plus a couple of day trips from each hub.
*   **Accommodation:** Mostly hostels (dorm rooms), with one 3-night splurge on a private room in Coimbra.
    *   *Average Cost:* Around €22-28/night for a good quality hostel dorm. The private room was €45/night.
    *   **Total Accommodation Cost: Approx. €750-€850**
*   **Food & Drink:** A mix of cooking in hostel kitchens, 'prato do dia' (daily special) lunches, local tascas for dinner, and a few supermarket picnics. Coffee and a pastel de nata were a daily ritual.
    *   *Average Cost:* Around €20-€25/day. This included a couple of nicer dinners (think €30-35) but mostly budget-friendly eats.
    *   **Total Food & Drink Cost: Approx. €600-€750**
*   **Inter-City Transport:** I relied on trains and long-distance buses. Booking a few days in advance usually got me better prices.
    *   Lisbon-Porto train: €26
    *   Porto-Coimbra train: €16
    *   Coimbra-Lagos bus: €35 (my longest journey)
    *   Lagos-Lisbon train: €28
    *   **Total Inter-City Transport Cost: Approx. €120-€150**
*   **Local Transport & Activities:** Metro cards in Lisbon/Porto, local buses, walking tours (tip-based, €5-10 each time), a few museum entries (e.g., Jerónimos Monastery, Tower of Belém combo ticket €12), a boat trip in the Algarve (€25).
    *   **Total Local Transport & Activities Cost: Approx. €150-€200**

**My Grand Total (excluding flights): Roughly €1620 - €1950 for the entire month.**

That's right. For a full month exploring a beautiful Western European country, I stayed well under €2000. My flights from North America were separate, but for the actual *living* there, it was far less than I'd budgeted.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

*   **Loneliness Happens (and it's okay):** There were days I felt a bit isolated, especially on long bus rides or when everyone in the hostel dorm seemed to be travelling with friends. I learned to lean into it, enjoy my own company, or proactively join a walking tour to meet people.
*   **Hostel Life is a Mixed Bag:** Some hostels were incredible – social, clean, great facilities. Others were just a bed. Reading recent reviews for cleanliness and common areas became key. Cooking my own meals in hostel kitchens saved a ton of money and was surprisingly social.
*   **The Power of Slow Travel:** Not rushing from city to city meant I could truly soak in the vibe, find local spots, and not spend a fortune on constant transport. Spending 7-10 days in one city allowed me to feel more like a temporary local than a tourist.
*   **Portuguese Food is More Than Nata:** Yes, the custard tarts are divine, but I discovered incredible seafood, cheap and hearty stews (cozido à portuguesa!), and excellent, affordable wine. Don't be afraid to try the local 'menu do dia'—it's usually the best value.
*   **Walking is Your Best Friend:** Portugal's cities are hilly, but walking everywhere saves money and lets you stumble upon hidden gems. Just bring comfortable shoes!
*   **Saying ""Yes"" (and ""No""):** I said yes to random conversations, to trying new foods, to getting lost. But I also learned to say no to expensive tourist traps or nights out I wasn't really feeling. Balancing social interaction with precious alone time was key.

Dear \[Agent Name\],

I am seeking representation for my 65,000-word dual-timeline romantic comedy, THE IDEAL AMERICAN WOMAN, set against the high-stakes backdrop of Washington, D.C. It will appeal to readers who love competent heroines, slow-burn banter, and romance that collides with real-world stakes, blending the whip-smart career ambition of Sally Thorne’s *The Hating Game* and the emotional second-chance pull of Emily Henry’s *Happy Place*. 

Louisa Kalluk has officially hit rock bottom. All in an honest day’s work, she quits her soul-sucking job, confesses to her mother that she’s been secretly paying off her debt (a task made significantly harder now that she’s unemployed), and discovers her boyfriend is cheating. So when an opportunity to start over in D.C. lands in her lap, she takes it.

New city. New career. No drama.

It’s a solid plan—until Jackson Wyatt walks back into her life.

Brilliant, stubborn, and distractingly handsome, Jackson is Louisa’s former best friend—and the one person who once made her feel both unstoppable and exposed. Now they’re forced to work side by side at Branwick, a high-profile tax consulting firm where reputation is currency and mistakes are fatal. Professional proximity quickly reignites late-night strategy sessions, unresolved tension, and chemistry that never quite burned out.

Just as Louisa begins to believe in the possibility of a second chance, the threads of her carefully constructed fresh start begin to unravel. Her meddling ex resurfaces to plant subtle reminders of why Jackson broke her heart all those years ago. Then a workplace rival, who happens to be the boss’s daughter and wants Jackson for herself, uncovers evidence that Louisa and Jackson’s relationship crossed professional lines. She offers Louisa an ultimatum: leave Branwick or Jackson gets fired from the job he adores.

Faced with an impossible decision, Louisa must decide what being the “ideal American woman” really means: checking everyone else’s boxes, or being brave enough to fight for a love that never followed the rules.

When I’m not writing, I work as a school nurse in North Carolina, where I live with my husband and Malinois. Like many others in this field, I love my daily dose of coffee, but my heart palpitations don’t, so it’s decaf for me!

1r4zqfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1r4zqfg/the_company_doesnt_care/,The company doesn’t care,"I work for a chain gas station. The one I work for primarily runs in the New England area. But the corporation owns about 5-7 other brands across the country. I’ve been at this company for almost 4 years at this point. I got hired in as a basic team member. 3 months into the job I was promoted to a lead role. I’ve held that position since. Even when they threatened to take it away bc of their own failures. In the 3.5 years I’ve gone thru 4 store managers.

Manager one ran the store PERFECTLY. She wouldn’t take any shenanigans or goofing off but was kind and cared about her team. She would write people up if she needed to. People did have their problems with her but that comes with any job.

Manager two was okay. He ran the store pretty okay. He did put his friendship with some employees over the job as a manager which lead to some problems. But at the end of the day he fired the ones who really messed up and the other one got a transfer and now KARMA is doin it’s thing 😈

Manager 3 was AWFUL and was just a stand in for about 3 weeks. They hired about 4 employees who lasted anywhere from 3 weeks to a year (the 1 year one is still at the store but is looking for a new job bc they’re at the same breaking point I am).

Manger FOUR 4️⃣ IV… LORD. Hold on to your boots folks. This is a roller coaster. 🎢

This one was new to management all around. They had been with the company for less than 2 years. They trained for the position with the company. But they were not mentally ready for what the position would include. I’m not saying I would make a better manager but previous employees, friends of mine, and family all tell me I could do the job better than this one. This mgr makes favoritism EXTREMELY obvious! Like to the point they hired a set of twins but will let one of them clock in and then sit with her for 20-45 mins before actually stepping foot on the sales floor. And Will simaltaniously let her do nothing bc she has issues with her side but when I have a full blown seizure will tell me I need to hurry up and get back to work. BITCH WTF?!? 🤬 this mgr will out right blame the second shift for shit not being done when it was clear as day to the guests of the store that the first shift AND the overnight (the job is a 24 hour store) just sit on they asses and don’t do a damn thing. The night shift will play catch up all day and make the job perfect but the second they step out the job becomes a disaster again. And when this all is brought to the manager there’s always a new excuse as to why first or third shift couldn’t just take out the trash or clean or whatever. It gets worse….the partner of said mgr was constantly calling the stores phone and blowing up their cell phone and keeping them from doing the job. AND when tried to get in contact with the mgr bc the job needed them for emergency, coverage, help at the store. Guess what? No Awnser. We’re lucky if we get a text an hour or so later. 

But in all reality, what I’m really the most ticked about is the fact of the matter that there have been several times where I have had a medical condition whether it be a panic attack and anxiety attack or a seizure, and when I tell the manager or the rest of the staff at this job hey this would help me a lot in these specific moments and things like keeping the trash bales in the middle of the aisles where we walk is a safety hazard let’s not do that anymore. I am told that “I don’t care that it’s safer or a hazard it makes my job easier when I’m making coffee“ and then the manager will sit and say well it’s never been a problem before now. And I’ll tell them “well it’s been a problem. You’re just not helping me fix it“ and then I become the bad guy. 

Then you bring this up the chain of command and to the DM a the DM just brushes it off and says it’s not that big an issue but I’ll talk to them. And then literally writes me up for being on my phone for 2 seconds. Like?!? All these ppl got me fucked up and the go after the wrong ones for the wrong things.

1r4zow9,https://i.redd.it/po802n43sjjg1.jpeg,SCRAPS: A Wordle meets Scrabble puzzle word game you can play in your browser now!,"Hello! I built SCRAPS. A Wordle spinoff for people who love the one-a-day word game routine, but want a little more variety and strategy.

**The Concept:**

In SCRAPS, you start each day with a fixed tray of 30 letter tiles. You're then given a series of incomplete 4-letter words. You have to use the tiles to form a word before moving to the next. Everyone globally gets the same tiles and faces the same 4-letter patterns in the same order. Your goal is to complete as many words as possible with the given tiles.

**The Strategy**:

It’s a casual optimizer. You might find a great word for the first pattern, but if it uses up all your 'A's and 'E's early, you’ll struggle to finish the later rounds. The goal isn't just to find words, it's to manage your ""Scraps"" to see how far you can go.

**Daily Seed**: The word patterns and letter tiles reset and midnight local.

**Stats**: Compare your score against the global distribution chart.

**No Pressure**: It’s a 5-minute puzzle designed for your morning coffee.

Me, my wife, and our four year old daughter go to a cafe every Saturday morning after our daughter's swim lesson. Being valentine's Day we thought it might be busy, but it wasn't - out of around 40 tables - maybe 8 were occupied.

We got there are and ordered around 9.20. Our order: 2 coffees, 1 babyccino, 1 fairy bread for our daughter and an omelette and hash brown for my wife and I to share.

We got the coffee within 5-6 minutes, but after almost 20 minutes we hadn't got the babyccino so I went to ask the Manager; ""excuse me mate, any idea how long the babyccino will take"" and he responds with ""can't you see how busy it is"" and I told him that we got our coffees quickly, so I'm not sure what's taking so long with a babyccino.  After his response, I turned away and in an exasperated fashion - raised my arms up and down once and went and sat down.

Another 5 minutes later - the Manager brings the babyccino and mind you it's been almost 30 minutes already and I was talking to our daughter as she said thank you to the Manger for her drink and he launches into a tirade!

He approached our table swearing in front of patrons & saying ""I've looked after you every time you've been here"" and then continuing to swear at me, my wife, and our 4 year old and then threatened me by saying if I speak like that again, he would take me ""outside"".

I said ""that's enough"" multiple times only for him to continue to say ""no, it's not f\*\*\*ing enough"" and the continued to say that I was the one swearing. Other patrons and the 2 other girls that were the staff witnessed the whole thing and 2 customers even came up to us and asked if we were okay - thank you to the friendly customers who checked because they knew how wrong & rude this Manager was by being threatening and literally leaning over the table at a 4 year old.

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN PLEASE! Someone else will not be as calm as I was in that scenario with an abusive individual swearing at them, their wife and child. 

My wife told him she will start videoing this encounter for him to then swear at my wife and say ""go and f\*\*\*ing do it"" I told him to never speak to my wife or in front of my child that way for him to then accuse me of swearing and raising my arms in frustration and threatened me to never do it again.

I even told him, mate there's a child here and there's no need for your to be threatening and abusive in front of a child. He literally said he ""didn't care""

It was a Coffee Club in our local area - I wrote a Google review (almost identical) and also complained on the Coffee Club website providing feedback about the cafe.

My question is WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IN THAT SITUATION with a grown man swearing at your wife and child and having no regard whatsoever for anyone there? Maybe I'm overthinking just quietly walking out, carrying my daughter and holding my wife's hand without saying a word?",54,1771112827.0,AskAnAustralian,148,0.85,False

Looking for advice on TTC on Vyvanse

I’m 35, based in Australia, and was formally diagnosed with ADHD in November 2025. I’m currently on Vyvanse 50mg after switching from Dex. Vyvanse has been working well and lasts most of my long workday.

I work from home in a high-pressure corporate role, full time over 4 days. My days usually run from around 5am–5pm. I use 5–7/8am for lighter tasks (emails, Teams) before taking Vyvanse at 7–8am for deep focus work. Since starting meds, my focus in meetings, complex documents, and report writing has improved significantly. I do notice a slight dip around 3–4pm and occasionally use a scoop of non-stim Oxyshred (I’m not a big coffee drinker). YES I KNOW I WILL NEED TO GIVE UP OXYSHRED WHEN I FALL PREG  😊

Because Vyvanse works so well for me and has literally changed my life I am worried about stopping it if needed. What did others do please? I will obviously do what is needed but would love to know experiences :)

This will be bub 4. Baby 1-3 were conceived in 1-2 months and whilst my youngest is 4 and eldest is 7 I feel confident in my ability to conceive.

Inside, a constant struggle raged: between a desire to prove himself and a fear of failure, between grand dreams and a reality that grew narrower with each passing day.



Kyle didn't own much; his apartment barely fit a small bed and an old wooden desk, its walls bearing the marks of damp and peeling paint. He lived on the brink of bankruptcy, chasing temporary jobs and counting every coin in his pocket as rent and debt piled up. Every night, he went to sleep hoping tomorrow would bring a new opportunity, and every morning he woke up to find himself in the same cycle: job hunting, rejection letters, and a gnawing anxiety.



Kyle's apartment was like a small box of memories and worries. The walls were painted a faded white, long since lost their luster. A single window overlooked a narrow alley, letting in sunlight for only a few minutes each day before the shadows returned. On the wall opposite the window, Kyle hung an old painting from his college days, its lines as tangled as his thoughts, its colors as muted as his dreams. In the corner, a small desk was piled high with papers and rejection letters from various companies, above which a yellow lamp cast a dim light, barely enough to dispel the gloom.



Kyle spent most of his time in this room, reading, writing, or staring at the ceiling. Sometimes, he would get up to make himself a cheap cup of coffee and sit on the edge of the bed, listening to the rain beat against the windowpane. In those moments, he felt profoundly alone, as if the whole world had forgotten him. Yet, something inside him refused to give up: a tiny spark of hope, or perhaps a hidden stubbornness, that drove him to keep searching for a chance to change his life.

One night, while Kyle was browsing job websites on his old computer, an advertisement unlike any he had ever seen appeared. It was simple, without colors or pictures, written in black font on a white background: ""Night shift worker needed for a private hospital. Starts immediately. No experience required. Competitive salary. Call now."" There was a phone number at the end of the advertisement, but no company name or further details.

Kyle paused at the advertisement, a strange feeling stirring in his chest—a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Why hadn't the ad named the hospital? And why did it specify night shifts only? Yet, his desperation had reached a point where he no longer had the luxury of choice. He picked up the phone and dialed the number with trembling fingers. It didn't ring for long; a quiet, indistinct voice came through: ""Hello, is this Kyle?"" He hesitated for a moment, then replied, ""Yes... I'm Kyle. I saw your job ad."" The response was swift: ""Yes, we were expecting you. You can come in tomorrow at 9:00 PM. The hospital is on Palm Street, Building 85. Don't forget your ID."" Then the line went dead.

Kyle sat staring at his phone for a few moments, trying to process what had happened. How did they know his name? And why hadn't they asked about his experience or qualifications? A shiver ran down his spine, but he convinced himself it was just a coincidence. Perhaps the ad was aimed at a group of job seekers, or maybe his name had appeared in some database. In the end, he had no other choice. He decided to go the next day, hoping this might be the opportunity he had been waiting for.



The following night, Kyle put on his only blue shirt and his faded black trousers. He walked through the darkened streets, watching the car headlights reflected on the wet pavements. It was cold, and the wind whipped through the dry leaves. The closer he got to Palm Street, the more silent and gloomy the city seemed to become. The buildings there were taller, their windows closed, their lights dim, as if they were silently observing the passersby.

When he reached building number 85, he paused for a moment in front of the main door. The building was unlike any other hospital he had seen: its glass facade was gleaming, almost too clean, without a trace of dust or fingerprints. Above the door, a metal plaque bore the hospital's name:

 "" Ravenhill Medical Center Hospital — Established in 1963."" The name was vaguely familiar, as if he had heard it in an old dream. He pushed the door open quietly and entered the lobby.

The hospital lobby was spacious and unusually bright. The white marble floor gleamed as if it had never been trodden upon. The walls were covered with modern paintings, their colors muted yet somewhat cool. In the corner, a receptionist sat behind a sleek glass desk, wearing a white coat and a surgical mask that covered half his face. There were no patients or visitors in the room; only a heavy silence filled the space.

Kyle walked over to the desk, and before he could say a word, the employee looked up and said, ""Hello, Kyle. We've been expecting you."" Kyle felt extremely flustered, but tried to appear normal: ""Thanks... I'm here for the job."" The employee pointed to an open register in front of him: ""Here, sign here."" Kyle looked at the register and saw his name already written in the new employee column, in neat and clear handwriting. He hesitated for a moment, then picked up the pen and signed next to his name.

""Your shift starts tonight,"" the clerk said calmly. ""The supervisor is waiting for you on the second floor. The elevator's there."" Then he went back to his work without looking at him again. Kyle felt something was off about the place: the excessive cleanliness, the silence, the way the clerk pronounced his name, the register with his name already on it. Nevertheless, he tried to convince himself it was just a coincidence, that this was probably the hospital's system.



Kyle walked to the elevator, pressed the button, and waited. The elevator was made of gleaming steel, its doors opening and closing silently. When he stepped inside, he noticed the control panel displayed only floor numbers, no signs or names. He pressed ""2,"" and the elevator felt ascend at an unusually slow pace. A large mirror on the back wall reflected his image distorted. For a moment, he thought his reflection was smirking at him, but he ignored it.

When he reached the second floor, he opened the door onto a long corridor lit by cool white lights. The floor was marble, and the walls were decorated with more paintings, this time featuring intricate geometric patterns. At the end of the corridor stood a tall man in a white coat, smiling mysteriously. Kyle approached him, and before he could speak, the man said, ""Welcome, Kyle. I'm the night supervisor. Come with me; I'll show you around."" Kyle followed the supervisor down the quiet corridors. Everything in the hospital was excessively clean; the smell of disinfectant was so strong it made him dizzy. The doors on either side of the corridor were tightly closed and made no sound. Occasionally, he could hear faint whispers coming from afar, but he couldn't pinpoint their source.

The supervisor stopped in front of a small room with a sign that read ""Night Watch Room."" He opened the door and gestured inside. ""This will be your office tonight. You'll be monitoring the cameras and noting anything unusual. If anything seems out of the ordinary, call me immediately."" Kyle entered the room and found it equipped with a large screen displaying images from the hospital's surveillance cameras. On the desk were a notebook and pen, and a wall clock hung above the screen.

Kyle glanced at the clock and noticed it was three in the morning, but it wasn't moving. Its hands were frozen, as if time had stopped at that moment. He tried to turn it with his hand, but it wouldn't respond. A shiver ran through him, but he tried to appear calm. He sat down in the chair and began watching the screens.

As he watched the monitors, Kyle noticed that some doors were opening and closing on their own, for no apparent reason. On one monitor, he saw a shadow quickly pass in front of the camera, but when he replayed the scene, he saw nothing. On another monitor, he noticed that a corridor remained lit the entire time, even though no one was in it. He tried to jot these observations down in his notebook, but found that the first page had his name and the date on it, written in a handwriting he didn't recognize.



At that moment, a young nurse entered, carrying a file. She was wearing a white uniform, and her face was pale as if she hadn't slept in days. ""Do you need anything, Kyle?"" she asked in a quiet voice. ""No... I'm just checking the cameras,"" he replied hesitantly. She gave a faint smile and said, ""If you notice anything unusual, don't hesitate to call us. We're always here."" Then she left and closed the door behind her.



Kyle sensed something was off about the employees' behavior: their answers were vague, their stares were cold, as if they knew something they didn't want to reveal. He tried to convince himself it was just initial jitters, but his anxiety was growing.



At midnight, the supervisor came in again and sat in front of him. He said in a quiet voice, but with a note of warning: ""Kyle, in this place, there are rules that you must abide by. Do not leave the room unless you have to. If you hear strange noises, ignore them. And if you see something that cannot be explained, write it down in the notebook and do not talk about it with anyone.""



Kyle hesitated for a moment, then said, ""Has anything happened here before? I mean... why all these rules?"" The supervisor smiled mysteriously and said, ""Every place has its secrets, Kyle. The hospital is old, founded in 1963, and has seen a lot. Don't worry, you'll get used to it soon."" Then he got up and left the room, leaving Kyle alone with his thoughts.



At that moment, Kyle sensed that the words he had heard held more than one meaning. There was something in the supervisor's tone that suggested what was happening here was not just routine procedure, but that there was a secret hidden within the walls of this place.



As the hours passed, Kyle began to feel that time had lost its meaning. The clock on the wall didn't move, the night never ended, and the lights never dimmed. At one point, he noticed that his name was written on every single piece of paper in the room, even on old files. He tried to ignore it, but he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him.

On one of the screens, he saw a door slowly opening, even though he was certain it had been closed just minutes before. He left the room to investigate and found the hallway empty and all the doors locked. When he returned to the room, he discovered that his notebook had been moved and the page on which he had written his notes had been torn out and disappeared.

At that moment, he heard a faint sound coming from the corridor: unintelligible whispers, like an echo of distant voices. He moved closer to the door and put his ear to it. He heard his name called in a faint voice: ***""Kyle... Kyle...""*** He stepped back, his heart pounding. He tried to convince himself that it was just his imagination, but the fear inside him was growing.

At the clock's stillness, as Kyle watched the screens, the lights in the corridors suddenly went out. Darkness reigned for a few moments, then the lights came back on, but the image on the screen had changed: a tall man in a black coat appeared, standing in the middle of the corridor, staring directly at the camera. His face was not clear, but his eyes were shining with an eerie light.

Kyle tried to scream, but his voice caught in his throat. At that moment, he heard the door behind him slowly open and felt cold breath on his neck. He turned slowly and saw a tall shadow standing by the door, reaching out toward him. He froze, unable to move or speak.

Then, suddenly, the screen went dark, and darkness returned. All he could hear was his own rapid breathing and the pounding of his heart. In that moment, Kyle **realized** he had entered a world unlike anything he had ever known a world of mystery and terror, where nothing was as it seemed, and where every answer opened the door to a new question.",1,1771112464.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1r4zgx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r4zgx0/i_dont_feel_like_im_alive_anymore/,I don’t feel like I’m alive anymore,"It’s been 11 months since he broke up with me. It was so sudden. Unexpected. He was the first man that ever made me feel like life is actually worth living. Every man in my life has abandoned me. My exes. My dad. My step dad. My gpa.  But he was my rock. I felt so safe with him. He understood me so so deeply, I was so in love. To this day I still can’t give one negative thing about him. I have his tshirt as my pillowcase still. His coffee mug is still by my bed.  I would have done anything in the world for him.

That morning, I made breakfast, we were watching a movie. We had arguably the best weekend we ever had together. I turned to look at him and he was crying. I thought something happened, but that’s when he just flat out says we cant be together. My world stopped. I couldnt react. I couldn’t process. I couldn’t cry. I just sat on the couch while he built the bookshelf that’s been sitting in a box the past few months on my floor. He built it in silence while he was crying. He washed the dishes from breakfast. I sat on the couch unable to understand what was happening. He hugged me goodbye for so long, absolutely sobbing, he told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him. I had never seen him cry before. I blankly stood there and said nothing, I was so numb and in shock. Then he left. He door dashed my favorite restaurant to me that night with a note that said, please make sure you eat. That was it. I regret saying nothing.

I feel like I’m grieving a death. It’s been 11 months. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I don’t go a day without crying. I cry when I drive to work. I cry in the bathroom at work. On my way home. I cry washing dishes. I haven’t slept in my bed since that day. I curl up on the couch every night and cry until I fall asleep. And then it just repeats. Sometimes I cry so hard I throw up. I’ve lost almost 30lbs.

I finally felt safe. Secure. Then just like every other man in my life, he abandoned me.. when I was at the happiest moment of my life. They were the best years I’ve ever had. I don’t think I will ever be happy again. My entire day revolves around thinking about him. How happy we were. How painful and lonely it is with him gone. He was my best friend.

I’m in therapy. I’ve tried going on dates- but I only compare them to him. I end up crying the whole ride home and blocking them because I don’t think I will ever find someone else that can fill my heart like he did.

When does this end. Please.

I’m so lonely I’m in actual pain. But I can’t move on.

I’m not looking for help. Or advice. I want to know I’m not alone and others have gone through this… and ended up being ok.",1,1771112319.0,BreakUps,2,0.67,False
1r4zgse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r4zgse/the_psychology_behind_why_you_overplan_stop/,"The Psychology Behind Why You Overplan: Stop Planning, Start Doing","I used to be the king of elaborate planning. Color-coded spreadsheets, perfectly structured Notion pages, and detailed timelines for everything. Then I'd never actually start the thing. Turns out I'm not alone; like 70% of people who set goals never even take the first step because they're stuck in what researchers call ""analysis paralysis.""

After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, reading way too many books on procrastination, and actually testing this stuff myself, I realized overplanning isn't preparation; it's avoidance dressed up as productivity. Your brain loves planning because it gives you the dopamine hit of progress without the discomfort of actual work. Sneaky bastard.

Here's what actually works instead:

**\*\*1. The 2-Minute Rule, But Make It Dumber\*\***

Everyone knows the 2-minute rule (if it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now). But here's the twist: use it to start EVERYTHING, not just small tasks. Want to write a book? Open a blank document and type one sentence. Want to learn guitar? Pick it up and play one chord. The goal isn't to finish; it's to obliterate the mental barrier between thinking and doing.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (5 million copies sold; dude knows his stuff). He calls them ""gateway habits,"" making the first step so stupidly easy that your brain can't argue with it. The book will genuinely rewire how you think about building habits. It's not about motivation or willpower; it's about designing systems that make starting inevitable. Best productivity book I've ever read, hands down.

**\*\*2. Set a Laughably Low Bar\*\***

Forget SMART goals for starting new things. They're terrible. ""I'll go to the gym 5 times a week for 60 minutes"" sounds great until life happens and you bail completely. Instead, commit to something embarrassingly easy. Show up at the gym for 10 minutes. Write 50 words. Practice Spanish for 3 minutes.

This comes from BJ Fogg's research at Stanford. He literally spent 20 years studying behavior change and found that motivation is unreliable, but tiny actions create momentum. His book Tiny Habits breaks down the science of why starting small actually leads to bigger changes than starting big. The Fogg Behavior Model he created is used by companies like Instagram and Headspace to build addictive products, but you can use it for good too.

**\*\*3. Use Implementation Intentions (Fancy Name for Simple Thing)\*\***

Instead of ""I should start that project,"" say, ""When I finish my coffee tomorrow at 9am, I will open my laptop and work on X for 15 minutes."" This isn't woo-woo; it's called an implementation intention, and studies show it doubles your success rate.

Research by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer found that people who use ""when-then"" planning are 2-3x more likely to follow through. Your brain loves specific cues. Give it a trigger (when X happens) and an action (I will do Y), and you bypass the decision-making that usually kills momentum.

**\*\*4. Kill the Research Phase\*\***

You don't need to read 47 articles and watch 23 YouTube videos before starting. That's procrastination cosplaying as diligence. Learn the absolute minimum to take step one, then figure out step two by actually doing step one. This is how every successful person I've studied actually operates; they're biased toward action, not preparation.

If you want to go deeper on these behavioral psychology concepts but don't have the energy to read through dense academic papers or multiple books, there's a personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. Built by a Columbia team, it turns books like Atomic Habits and Tiny Habits, plus research papers and expert insights on productivity and behavior change, into customized audio lessons. You can set goals like ""I'm a chronic overplanner, and I want practical strategies to just start things,"" and it creates a learning plan tailored to your specific struggle. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and even pick different voice styles. Makes it way easier to absorb this stuff during your commute instead of letting it sit on your reading list forever.

Ali Abdaal talks about this constantly on his podcast Deep Dive. He's a doctor turned YouTuber with 5 million subscribers who built everything through ""learning in public,"" starting before he felt ready and course correcting along the way. His content on productivity isn't recycled self-help garbage; it's evidence-based strategies mixed with real talk about what actually works.

**\*\*5. Track Starts, Not Results\*\***

Forget outcome goals initially. Track how many times you started. Opened the document? Win. Went to the gym parking lot? Win. Sent one networking email? Win. This trains your brain to value the behavior of starting, which is literally the only thing you can control anyway.

I use an app called Habitica for this. It gamifies habit tracking by turning your life into an RPG where you earn points and level up by completing tasks. Sounds dorky, but it works because it makes starting visible and rewarding. Way better than a boring spreadsheet.

**\*\*6. Embrace the Shitty First Draft of Everything\*\***

Your first workout will suck. Your first chapter will be garbage. Your first business pitch will bomb. Cool, that's literally how it works for everyone. Perfectionism isn't a virtue; it's fear wearing a fancy hat. Done badly is infinitely better than planned perfectly.

Anne Lamott's book Bird by Bird should be required reading for anyone who struggles with starting. She's a bestselling author who writes brutally honestly about the creative process, and her whole philosophy is ""shitty first drafts. "" Just get something, ANYTHING, on the page. You can't edit a blank page, but you can edit garbage into gold.

**\*\*7. Build in Accountability That Actually Scares You\*\***

Telling your mom you'll start that side hustle does nothing because she loves you unconditionally. Instead, tell someone who will actually call you out, or better yet, make a public commitment. Join a community, post your goal online, and pay for a class.

I use an app called Ash for accountability around personal goals. It's like having a life coach in your pocket who checks in on you regularly and helps you work through the mental blocks. The AI is surprisingly good at asking the right questions when you're stalling out.

The reality is your brain is wired to avoid discomfort and uncertainty. Planning feels safe; starting feels scary. But nothing in your life changes until you move from ideation to action. Most people die with their best ideas still locked in their heads because they never got past the planning phase.

You don't need more time, more resources, or more information. You need to start before you feel ready, suck at it for a while, and trust that momentum builds momentum. Stop worrying about the perfect plan and just take one small, imperfect action today.",1,1771112310.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False
1r4zf9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r4zf9p/human/,Human.,"I have never been good with my emotions, I hold them in and then at the brink it all comes crashing down. I don't know how to open myself up to someone romantically, I don't know how to trust someone romantically. How do I do that?

Maybe you're a test for me to change, to be able to express how I am feeling so deeply for you. To let go of my pride and presumed assumptions about you. I want you more than these bleak words on a screen can describe.

I want to be frank with you, I want to just ask you for a coffee but I don't know how to meet you in the middle. I don't know how to reach you when you've put up walls.

The truth is that my life feels like it is speeding up and I have no control over it. Though it might seem like I am quite happy, I can't seem to connect with those around me, as I once could. Family is important but they are your family, they cannot understand everything in your life. Friends have their own responsibilities, their own relationships and careers to build.

Indeed, the void of loneliness is spreading through my body more quickly than I would admit.

I don't know why you are the only thought I can't let go of. Amidst it all, all I find myself thinking about is one person, *you.*

Why is it always you? You have not shown me that you can be there for me. Or maybe you have, but it is me who is too scared to let you past my walls.

I want you here with me, I want you to ground me. Remind me that I can feel. I want to cry in front of you about all of my struggles, everything that makes me upset. Everything that makes me happy, everything that makes me angry. *I want to be raw, I want to be human*.

I want to rip my heart out and put it next to yours, so I can hear it beating. So I can feel that you are real and with me through it all. *Remind me that I am human*.

Everything that I have felt for you over the months has not once extinguished and I don't think it will ever go away. It breaks my heart to imagine you spending this evening with another woman but I know that I cannot expect you to wait for me.

I will always want you, even if society says I can never have you.

I got a Breville Oracle Jet two weeks ago because I bought into the idea that it’s going to help me dial in the beans and that it’s going to be simple enough for my partner who has to wake up early if I can save profiles for him after dialing in the beans.

Even with the barista guidance I struggled to dial in new beans (light or medium roasts). Gemini recommended to switch from volume to time where which feels more intuitive but is still hard.

Ended up getting smaller IMS baskets to get closer to 16g doses and a naked portafilter. Also got a scale so I can measure the output.

But I still went through half a 2lb bag trying to dial my new beans that I was really excited about (The cherry marzipan one from Perc Coffee: https://perccoffee.com/products/colombia-jhon-rodriguez-ombligon).

Love that the beans come with instructions (GRIND: 6,

DOSE: 16G, YIELD: 36G, TEMP: 205°F, TIME: 0:23, TDS: 8.01) and I controlled what I can (dose, temp, stopping at my scale measuring 36g yield). Not sure what grind size 6 is on the Jet, but a grind of 25 got me pretty close to 36g yield in 23 seconds, no channeling, and the result tasted acceptable but still a bit off I also get inconsistent yields if I keep pulling the same grinds at 25 with 23 seconds.

The whole dialing in process is frustrating me and I get sad when I invest in special beans just to waste half of them.

I saw they sell single dosage adapters for the Breville. Would investing in that (so I can pre-weigh my beans) and manually tamping help?

I’m debating if I should just give up on fresh roasts and stick to a cheap basic bean from the store.

I also saw that the upcoming Fellow Espresso Series 1 (I’m still within the return window of my Breville) has settings profiles you can download for each coffee bean they sell on their site.

Wondering if that would solve my dialing in frustration by being able to just download the parameters. Although my experience with the Breville not being as beginner friendly as advertised makes we wonder if those profiles on the Fellow actually help or if marketing just makes it seem more helpful as it ends up being.

Any thoughts?

1r4zaxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1r4zaxa/what_religious_group_did_i_encounter_in_california/,What religious group did I encounter in California?,"Hey all, last Friday night I was booked to do a performance at a private home in a suburban community in the mountains of Ventura County.

Everybody was wearing the same style of old-school clothing: 60s-style dresses for women, suits with tweed pants for men. The women were all slim and conventionally attractive, but I noticed they had no make-up on. 4 adult women in attendance had 7, 6, 6, and 5 kids respectively. Children significantly outnumbered adults.

There were no crosses on display, nor any icons or crucifixes in the house. However, they had several printed materials around the tables that said things like ""X years of faithful service"" and ""lord bless this man / family / house."" They also had a moment in the party when they all prayed together. The prayer itself was vanilla, nothing out of the ordinary.

There was quite a bit of alcohol at the party, everyone was drinking wine. There was also beer and whiskey. There was also coffee. Also, several of the men were smoking cigars, but none of the women. They had a normal relationship with technology (they had phones, cars, etc.) but everything in the house was just... a bit old.

They were extremely nice. They thanked me several times for my performance and were checking on me constantly to make sure I had everything I needed. But I'll be honest, I felt really ""watched."" I might have been the only person who was not from the family, and I got the feeling they didn't interact much with the outside world. Every time I stood up (even just to go to the bathroom), they would stop talking and look at me. It was legitimately a very weird experience.

Everyone was white. Almost everyone was in a couple. All adults had kids, with the exception of one young woman. No outwardly LGBT+ people. Women tended to do most of the setup work, though the men were very respectful and helped by bringing them food, etc.

So, here's a recap of what I think I know:

1. Definitely some sort of Christian / Christian offshoot.
2. They probably have a strong anti-birth-control stance.
3. They have some sort of prohibition on religious imagery.
4. They believe in strong gender roles.
5. They have a clear dress code that looks out of place in modern society.
6. They did NOT have a prohibition on alcohol & coffee (not Mormons.)
7. They did NOT have a prohibition on technology (not Amish / Anabaptist.)
8. They did NOT have specific rituals related to the Sabbath (not 7th-day Adventist), since I was there on a Friday night.

So, out of curiosity - what group could this have been?

It's certainly possible that this was just a normal American church-going family. But the dress code and extreme number of kids, combined with the consistent looks I was getting the whole time I was there make me believe it was a more isolated community.

I also understand this could have been a very unique thing, e.g. one family that has specific and unique beliefs. But I like reading about cults, and I'm just wondering if there is one that this would fit. It was like stepping into a different time! I was legitimately wondering whether this was all some sort of dream or whether they put something in my water. Nothing happened in the end. They gave me a really nice tip and I was on my way.",5,1771111868.0,NoStupidQuestions,6,0.78,False
1r4z9s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1r4z9s9/ongoing_complaints_from_neighbors/,Ongoing complaints from neighbors,"Hi everyone, 

Looking for a bit of advice on what is “fair” with my neighbors. 

We live in a townhome, and have been here since mid 2010, we’ve had several “renters” next door to us and have never had any issues.

Recently, a family bought the unit and for about a year there were no issues. We were all friendly with each other. A few weird things have happened, like when we’re laughing, or just being very animated and silly (which happens but it’s not excessive or anything) we hear banging on the wall, but never thought much about it. They had some work done inside the home for 3 months mon-Friday, drilling hammering, etc. I had to move my work space to another bedroom, which honestly wasn’t a big deal to me. 

Around summer, their daughter (high school age) has started causing few problems around our complex. One being taking our bulk trash that was set out and for no apparent reason breaking the styrofoam into hundreds of pieces all over the place. Then her “boyfriend” was hiding his scooter in our bushes. We brought this up to the parents, and it was rectified. No other issues, still very polite with each other! 

A few months ago, we started noticing dog poop all over our yard. I mean like on the edge of our grass/driveway. We actually stepped in it getting out of our car. We got a camera (which we were totally against wanting one) but felt we had to, and realized it was the neighbors not picking up after their dog. 

We sent a very polite text, and asked whoever walks the dog in the front to please pick it up. The neighbors responded back that they ALWAYS pick up after their dog, and we’re wrong (even though we bought a camera and have evidence) They also said we “disturb” them by having “long conversations”, which really was a shock. As we can often hear their tv, loud music, and the work that was done for 3 months straight. Without ever complaining because we do live in a shared community 

The wall banging is getting out of control. Yesterday morning it was 6:30am and we were in bed having coffee talking about the agenda for our day. Very normal conversation nothing loud at all, and he banged on the wall like 3 times. I’m starting to feel like he’s using this as a scare tactic and it’s starting to feel like a violation of my privacy. 

My question is, do I have the right to ask him to stop banging on our wall as a use of intimidation? I mean we are all adults if by chance we ARE being too loud, which we really don’t go out of our way to be. Why can’t he communicate directly? It’s really freaked me out. 

If this is too long, basically neighbors are banging on our wall and it’s starting to feel like an intimidation factor and invasion of privacy. ",3,1771111782.0,neighborsfromhell,15,0.64,False
