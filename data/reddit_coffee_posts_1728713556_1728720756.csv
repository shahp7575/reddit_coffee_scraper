1g1vfv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1g1vfv9/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn’t been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless blood baths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami. 

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can’t tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Me and mother were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can’t tell when Father explained it to her.

“You will see, Jonathan,” she used to say. “Soon you will see.”

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn’t good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn’t meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I don’t think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted you would think there was no such time. I don’t know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value in the eyes of my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoyed to study. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn’t have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father’s many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father’s opinion shouldn’t be something to be taken into consideration. But I stayed. I stayed by my father’s side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn’t I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn’t owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn’t wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn’t just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many different characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast’s existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point in time, we couldn’t say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn’t perfect. Take my family for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn’t enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn’t just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn’t handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn’t the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one’s own loss? The answer is the beast tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn’t.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn’t just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn’t just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records show that the beast isn’t someone to be trifled with, but he doesn’t seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said this doesn’t mean he would die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death’s door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn’t believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn’t willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools’ lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn’t come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn’t nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn’t such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast’s body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. At that point in time, I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn’t been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don’t know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn’t moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He wanted to learn more about him before killing him.

“What are you talking about, man?!” the beast cried. “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father’s wrath.

“Show yourself, devil!” my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. “Your lies won’t convince anyone!”

The beast’s face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn’t a man in front of me.

“Jonathan, do it,” Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That’s why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn’t enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn’t even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can’t be washed away. It shouldn’t. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured… no, three days I endured.

Up until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn’t stand any more second in this.

“Just say it,” I said, turning towards the beast. “Just tell him what he wants to learn.”

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn’t left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don’t dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet he hadn’t died.

The beast’s head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

“I can’t…,” he said. “I can’t wake. Let me sleep. I can’t endure it…”

“Then confess!” I said. “Be truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!”

The beast shook his head, tears falling. “It hurts… it hurts so much…”

Somehow, I knew he wasn’t speaking about the torture I put him through. “What do you mean? What is hurting you?”

“My head… it’s full. Please, I don’t want to wake…”

“What are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!”

“It hurts?!” the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Due to that, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn’t be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

“It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”

He didn’t stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. “Why did you wake me?! Why?!”

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn’t understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor me were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can’t begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

“It’s all your fault!” the beast spat at me. “All of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!”

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don’t know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn’t made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn’t find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn’t seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don’t know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them. 

I won’t describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known, that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn’t care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can’t say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We’ve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn’t do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn’t live without my deeds. I wasn’t wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn’t choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can’t say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren’t they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he’d had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won’t forgive him. I don’t think anyone can. My speculations shouldn’t be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast.  

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can’t let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder, how I found you? How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can’t ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won’t see me coming. You won’t feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won’t think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.

1g1vaw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g1vaw4/aitah_that_i_got_upset_when_my_husband_didnt_come/,AITAH that I got upset when my husband didn't come to the vet with me?,"Sorry for any errors or wrong structuring, English is not my first language and I can't stop crying while typing this. It's long so please bear with me.

So, two nights ago, at around 9:30pm I went to cuddle my dog and noticed that he was bleeding from his penis. There was quite a lot of blood and I freaked out. I yelled for my husband and started getting ready to rush him to the vet (ofcourse expecting him to come along, there were no second thoughts in my mind) but then he asked me who I was going with, I was taken aback but I shrugged it off and I told him I will go with my sister (she stays very close by). He immediately called her up and she said she can't go because her 1 year old baby is sick and is constantly crying for her (a very valid reason), he tried convincing her to go with me but she genuinely couldn't. 

So, he asked my if he should come along or could I manage on my own. Truth be told, I was quite disappointed that he even had to think about this so I told him I could manage and that if he wants to come he can come, if he doesn't, he can stay at home. His choice completely.

Then he says he hasn't even had dinner yet, mind you, even i hadn't had my dinner since I was waiting for him to come home, (he had gone to his house to meet his family), and I told him we can leave once he finishes eating or could even eat in the car (since we have a chauffer). But he said no (he loves sitting in front of the TV and eating). At the end I ended up going alone. He called me when I was in the car on the way to the vet and I admit I was a but short with him, I was panicking about all the blood and sorta irritated with him that he didn't come.

I came back from the vet (my baby is fine thank God) and my husband's proceeds to ignore me and not talk to me at all. I go to the kitchen, get some food, sit on the table to eat and he continues to watch TV and not join me at all. While I was in the kitchen, he yelled out ""are you upset again"" and I replied back saying ""I was a but irritated before but I am over it now"". Later,  I tried asking him a couple of questions to make conversation but he either would respond or give one word answers.

Que next morning, he still would talk to me, I tried breaking the ice by offering him some breakfast, didn't get a great response but then after a while he asked me to try some of the breakfast that he was eating and that's that. (I was eating breakfast on table whereas he was eating it on the sofa while watching tv). I had some errands go run so I got ready, no more conversation took place between us and it was sorta upsetting me, I confronted him before leaving about how him behaving this way is not right, we had a little back and forth without reaching a consensus and I left. While I was in the car he called me up and told be - ""I'm sorry I should I have come with you last night, I've just been annoyed about something since the past 2 days but is till should have come with you"". I told him that I appreciated his apology and I am glad he understood. And the conversation ended. FYI, he didn't seem 'annoyed' about some situation since the past 2 days. He went to meet his family, went for a coffee with his friend, met a few people regarding work (all of this on the day of the vet visit). But whatever. 

So while running my errand, since I assumed all was okay, I video called him too to show him what I was wearing, his response was blag but I didn't notice it. I came back and he is again ignoring me and not talking to me. He didn't even tell me a hi when I got back home. He was in front of his TV. So I went to him, told him a hi, he told me a very blah hi back and continued watching his TV. Didn't speak to me for the rest of the day and quite frankly I was getting annoyed of his behaviour too. I was upset but he is behaving like I wronged him!

And now, to today morning, where shit really went down, I told him we needed to talk and told him what I was feeling. He completely flipped the tables on me and told me that it is completely my fault because I didn't cajole him into asking what was bothering him. One, I didn't know whatever that was 'annoying' him was so big, two, just because he is annoyed about something, can he just stop talking to me like this.

I know it's a small issue, but he said some really hurtful things about my character amd went as far as saying that he is going to talk to the parents today and tell them that it is not working out between us.

I couldn't help it and I started crying and telling him let's seek a councellors help or speak to our siblings for a perspective but he said that no, he doesn't want to work on this anymore.

I had to go to the bathroom to compose myself and when I came back put, I went to him and I told him - "" I am very very sorry. I should have asked you what is wrong. My bad. I am sorry. Please forgive me"" and his response was - ""I don't forgive you"". I apolozed again and again, atleast 8 times, and he kept saying ""I don't forgive you"" again and again. 

Now I am here in the bathroom again. So, AITAH ? Or am I overreacting?",1,1728720000.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I drink my espresso almost exclusively as a single shot flat white. When I open a new bag of coffee and dial it in, the first drink is almost always surprisingly full of flavor, structured, nuanced. Basically I am usually able to confirm that the taste profile on the bag really matches what I've produced. It's lovely.

However the next time I make the drink those nuances are gone. The coffee is still well prepared, tastes good, it's a good milky drink... but the brightness is gone.

As if the beans have gotten significantly more stale in the 12 to 24 hours between drinks.

And I don't really know what's at play here...

Is my brain just more strongly noticing the taste difference from the last bag of coffee when I open up a new one (usually different beans)?

Are my beans really getting stale this fast? I just leave them in their bag on my kitchen counter. I fold the bag and try to minimize the amount of air within. I always thought this is good enough, but maybe it isn't?

Dream:

I was on a road trip with my mum and brother, and every so often we would stop by a coffee shop and I would go in by myself and buy something.

The boy who worked at the door was really nice, and every time I walked into one of these shops he'd be working there, and he'd say hi to me.

One time, I wanted to buy a coffee that costed 5 pounds, but I had 20 pounds on me instead. I went up to the boy at the front and asked if he had a 5 pound note that he could give me if I gave him the 20. He did, so we traded and I bought my coffee, but I forgot to get my change back from him (£15).

Before getting in the car, I saw a massive spider on the wall next to the car. It looked really ugly. I think we were somehere in america where you have these kinds of spiders.

I got back in my mums car, but the passengers seat where I usually sat was bashed in as if a truck had rammed into it, so I had to sit in the back next to my brother while my mum drove in the front.

The next time we stopped, I found another one of these coffee shops, and I saw him again. I wanted to get some coffee again, but I didnt have any money, so he laughed and gave me the £15 change that I forgot to get from him last time, and I used it to buy coffee.

As I walked out, I noticed that his shift had just ended, and he was walking out too, slightly ahead of me. He wore a pink shirt.

I walked down the street, around a truck, trying to get back to my mums car, but a part if me wanted to see where he was going, so I kept walking at his pace until our paths diverged.

Suddenly, he fell to the floor and broke out in spots all over his body. (Seizure or allergic reaction?) I ran up to him and took out my phone. I remember asking myself if I should call 999 or 111(999 is for emergencies, 111 is for if you don't know if its an emergency or not.)

The boy could still respond to me in one word answers, but the spots made it so that it hurt to open his mouth and move his fingers. 

He aggreed that I should call 111. I assumed that this was something that happened often. I tried to dial the numbers, but because this was a dream, obviously I kept tapping the wrong things. Before I could get the right number, the spots dissapeared, he stood up, thanked me and kept walking.",1,1728719244.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

The door clicks shut behind me, soft but final, marking the quiet shift between the world outside and the one inside. I stand for a moment, my hand lingering on the handle, as if bracing against the weight I carried in. The light is familiar—late morning, spilling through the windows in golden streaks, warming the air. It feels as if I’ve just arrived, but there’s an edge, a tension I can’t quite shake off yet. I’m always slower to let go of what’s outside.

I toss my keys onto the wooden surface by the door, the sound landing with a solid clatter, grounding me in the space. There’s a physicality to the motion, an effort to mark the separation between here and there. The world outside hums, a distant echo of its demands, but in here, the pull starts to fade, loosening its grip on my shoulders.

Someone is by the window, as they always are. She sits quietly, her presence soft and delicate, barely disturbing the air around her. Her back is to me, but there’s a sense of ease, a stillness that radiates from her. She doesn’t carry the weight of the world like I do. There’s a comfort in how she holds herself, as if she’s never needed to prove her place here. She gazes out at the city, but it’s not with the same urgency that I feel. The world outside seems distant to her, a thing to be watched, maybe even admired.

I shrug off my coat, the movement deliberate, shedding the remnants of the day, of who I had to be out there. My steps are heavier, more rooted as I walk to my room. Inside, the space feels like it’s been waiting for me, untouched yet familiar. The clothes in the wardrobe are softer, lighter, a contrast to the weight I just let go of. I change, and with each piece, something shifts in me. The tension eases, the sharp edges dull.

In the kitchen, I reach for the Moka Pot, the old metal cool and steady in my hands. It’s a part of me, like the weight I carried in, but it’s softer now. The act of making coffee is deliberate, grounding. The time it takes gives me space to breathe, to let go of the last fragments of the outside world.

As I pour the coffee, I walk through the room, from the kitchen toward the sofa. My steps slow, each one lighter than the last. The air in here feels different, warmer, like a deep exhale that’s been waiting to release. There’s a quiet in me now that matches the space, a freedom that settles as I cross the room.

I sink into the couch, the cushions soft and yielding beneath me. Across the room, she is still by the window, still gazing out, still smiling. Her presence is light, a beautiful feminine spirit, completely at ease in her skin. There’s something in the way she exists here, so unlike me. I came in carrying the outside, feeling every step, but she… she’s always been at peace. Her world doesn’t seem to press down on her the way mine does. She’s content, watching the city with an understanding I can’t quite touch. We don’t need to speak. There’s never been a need for words between us.

The light shifts, the breeze stirring the curtains as the morning stretches on. I sit, the cup warm in my hands, the tension fully gone. The city below hums with its own life, but it doesn’t reach me now. I am far from it, removed, held in this place that feels separate, timeless.

And then, as I glance toward her, the thought comes, quiet and lingering. There’s a shift, a soft realization, as if a truth has been waiting to surface. She isn’t separate from me. She never was.

I don’t say it. I don’t need to. The moment holds itself, unchanged but different. The weight of the outside world never followed me in here, because this place isn’t part of that world. It’s a sanctuary I’ve built, a vision of something I long for but can’t quite touch.

A quiet sadness stirs beneath the surface. This space—this peace—is something I can feel but not hold. It’s real only in moments like this, fleeting and distant. If I want it, if I ever try to make it mine, the cost would be too high. It would break the life I’ve built outside.

So I sit, holding the thought gently, knowing it can’t be more than this—a moment, a breath, a dream that fades when the door clicks shut behind me again.

Today, we're diving into the topic of coffee grounds. And first, let's clear up a common confusion:

* **Ground coffee** refers to coffee beans that have been ground up and are ready to be brewed.
* **Coffee grounds** are what's left over *after* you've brewed your coffee.

While most people toss those used grounds in the trash, they actually have a surprising number of uses! Let's explore how you can reuse your coffee grounds at home and how industries are taking advantage of this valuable resource:

**How You Can Reuse Coffee Grounds at Home:**

* **Composting:** Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, making them a fantastic addition to your compost bin. They help create nutrient-rich soil for your garden.
* **Fertilizer:** Sprinkle coffee grounds directly onto your soil to provide plants with essential nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.
* **Pest repellent:** The strong smell of coffee can help deter pests like slugs, snails, and ants. Scatter grounds around your plants or create a barrier around garden beds.
* **Odor neutralizer:** Coffee grounds can absorb unpleasant odors. Place a bowl of dried grounds in your fridge or freezer to keep it smelling fresh.
* **Exfoliating scrub:** Mix coffee grounds with a little coconut oil or honey to create a natural and invigorating body scrub.
* **Cleaning agent:** The abrasive texture of coffee grounds can help scour stubborn stains on pots and pans.

**Industries Taking Advantage of Coffee Grounds:**

* **Biofuel:** Coffee grounds can be converted into biodiesel, a renewable fuel source for vehicles.
* **Mushroom cultivation:** Spent coffee grounds provide an excellent growing medium for mushrooms.
* **Furniture and building materials:** Companies are exploring ways to use coffee grounds to create sustainable composite materials for construction and furniture.
* **Cosmetics and skincare:** Coffee's antioxidant properties make it a popular ingredient in skincare products, and some companies are using coffee grounds to create exfoliating scrubs and masks.

**Sustainability Benefits:**

* **Reduces waste:** Reusing coffee grounds diverts waste from landfills, reducing methane emissions and environmental impact.
* **Conserves resources:** By utilizing coffee grounds as a resource, we reduce the need to extract new materials, saving energy and protecting natural resources.
* **Promotes a circular economy:** Reusing coffee grounds helps create a closed-loop system where waste is transformed into valuable products.

So next time you brew a pot of coffee, remember those grounds are more than just trash! By reusing them at home or supporting businesses that utilize this valuable resource, you can contribute to a more sustainable future.

Extraction time was around 20 seconds, the yield was 70 grams (which is double the amount I was expecting??) and the crema was a bit bubbly.

How do I improve my results? As I was expecting \~30 second extraction time, 32g of yield, and nice crema.

F., after they learned of it from people associated with the community connections space–that space in the lobby that serves coffee. B. F. is an indigenous woman who’s hard of hearing, lives in shelters, and on EIA i believe. Apparently her son phones her at the library, he is in jail, and this was basically the last place she can recieve calls. Anyway, she was banned supposedly for being disruptive, or as my associate put it: being a nuisance to the social workers and staff in community connections. I was told, B. F. is not violent, she is excitable, loud, poor, and very explicit to people that she is poor and library staff are paid more than she has had in her whole life. Every day she reminded them she lives cheque to cheque and they make what? Well, according to collective agreement the library workers there are making $26-31 an hr, the librarians are making $34-40 an hr, and the social workers are making $39-43 an hr. And B. F.  makes like 300 a month. Oh, and let me be up front, both groups, B. F. and these city workers, are paid through different streams of tax money.

Like my friend, like many people in Canada, i think about what reconciliation is. I think about taxes and how they are spent or allocated.  I think about UBI, how ineffective the police and social workers are for solving crime and poverty; about barriers;; and I think about socialism, history, 1919, rights. We were taught about tax funded residential schools in school and I am learning more in university. and I would like to think about it briefly with all of you, and about B. F.

Where to begin, well, how were these city workers able to get to where they are now? Well, this country and this province systematically tried to exterminate indigenous cultures. The irony is that the reason these people can ban their nuisance is because their families profited from the tax funded murder of this person’s culture and most likely parts of her family.

But wait, this is too simple, just because genocide paid for these people’s education (maybe), and genocide created the organization called City of Winnipeg, doesnt mean that genocide and the racism that powered it are to blame here! This person’s behavior is to blame. They were rude, or violent, or confrontational. Umm, these people are fucking social workers and library workers, in a space dedicated to working with the lowest of the low, and a space claiming to be a safe space and welcoming space. they give people coffee. they chose to ban a person who is a perfect representative of the population they have chosen to work with and work for so  people like B. F. can live better lives.

But tough love, right? There are rules, there are lessons people need to learn, right? And the best way to teach someone a lesson is to deprive them of contact with their son, say through a residential school or a jail; or to deprive them of warmth, say by not funding affordable housing, instating a UBI or by kicking old starved kicked around woman out of the only space they had left. It’s just good classist, oh i mean classy British Canadian etiquette that demands no swearing, no loudness, no rudeness, and no talking about pay cheques or responsibility for the past. Or how there is an irony to 1919 and a union that is quiet about the genocide that let their families fight and eat and grow powerful and affluent as an organization for the select people.

I bet they've all read Dickens or London or Kipling, maybe one or two indigenous authors, they work in a colonial library, surely they understand irony and what colonialism/classism is right? right? Like, they know they work downtown right? Or are they hoping to make downtown a new type of colonial prison where indigenous bodies have to follow library rules that were made by white librarians who, back when the library system was actually separate colonial towns and millennium was centennial and the colony was healthy because there were less [insert racial terms] for the not really here / not around but in those patrolled camps called reserves and funded by good hard working canadians. 

Anyways, i am grateful for my friend for sharing with me their frustration, and it made me want to share it. What they had to say stuck with me and I hope it does with you too, it’s supposed to be a joke: well Millennium and Winnipeg is still trying to keep certain people out, it’s a part of our shared heritage.

I thought we were solid until I found out he was cheating on me with a mutual friend, Sarah (26F). It felt like a gut punch, and after confronting him, he admitted it without any remorse.

I spent some time feeling heartbroken and betrayed, but then I decided I wanted some revenge. I knew Mark was very close to his brother, Jake (30M), who had always treated me well and had hinted he had feelings for me in the past. So, I hatched a plan.

First, I started hanging out more with Jake. I’d invite him to the gym and for coffee, pretending it was just friendly. As we spent more time together, we grew closer, and I could see that he was really into me. The more I flirted with him, the more I felt empowered.

Once I felt like I had Jake wrapped around my finger, I made my move and we ended up sleeping together. It was exhilarating to think about how it would affect Mark. I knew it would hurt him to find out that his brother and I had hooked up, especially given our history.

But I didn’t stop there. I subtly sabotaged some of Mark’s plans at work, sharing information that would make him look bad to his boss. I knew he was counting on a promotion, and I couldn’t resist making him feel the consequences of his actions in every aspect of his life.

When Mark eventually found out about Jake and me, he was furious. He confronted me, and I told him I hoped he enjoyed the view from the bottom because that’s where he was headed. I felt a rush of satisfaction watching him realize what he had lost.

Now, I’m feeling mixed emotions. Part of me thinks I was justified in taking my power back and showing him the consequences of his betrayal. On the other hand, I worry that I crossed a line by getting involved with his brother and actively sabotaging him.

1g1ugc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubud/comments/1g1ugc2/solo_in_ubud_story_from_my_bali_travels/,Solo in Ubud — Story from My Bali Travels,"# On the world map

My second time in the city of Ubud in less than two years. Something about the energy of this place that keeps pulling you back for more. A slow isolated town in the main island of Bali, 50 km away from its capital city Denpesar. This small charming rural town got placed on the world map after the movie “Eat Pray Love”. Advent of social media platforms like Facebook and hyper glamorized Instagram pics only added fire to the travel hunger of people. This is the town where Julia Roberts heals herself and finds her true love. A story that works for many of us around the world who are trying to find solace and heal themselves in one form or the other. Alas, she only finds her love, how she maintains it for the rest of her life is not part of any movie. Local people mentioned that there has been a huge inflow of tourism in this town which has pushed it in a direction of irreversible damage. Land has been traditionally cheap in Bali. Natives are falling prey to the charm of making quick money and selling their beautiful rice fields to the businessmen who in turn care more about the return on their investment versus the damage they cause to its local culture and ecological balance. But when you as a traveler are part of the problem you can hardly complain.

# City of art and aesthetics

Ubud is also a place of creativity and local artistic talent. Locals are passionate about their art, daily rituals and culture and you will find at least one painter or a musician in every household. Their love for arts give this town a unique sense of aesthetics and has attracted artists from all over the world who want to remain secluded from the world and practice their art. The art gets reflected in the design of their homes, shops, yoga studios, ambiance of their restaurants. One can notice graffiti or a beautiful mural even in the random uninhabited corners of the town. I have traveled far and wide but not yet seen more beautiful yoga studios than this place.

The town is full of beautiful temples, trees, terrains and nice lush wet rice fields. Locals Balinese people have apparently developed a very sophisticated irrigation system called Subak, a farming practice that has been continuing for more than a thousand years in this part of the world. Island is predominantly Hindu. Local Balinese people believe in Karmic philosophy (bear the brunt of your actions either in this life or future life). People are utterly nice, god fearing, simple, hardworking and believe in doing morally right things. It is one of the very few places where I have found myself safe, walking alone at night without any fear. People negotiate in most of the daily transactions but easy and cheaper access to resources makes this town an attraction for many westerners who have relatively higher buying power.

# Never ending Race of Consuming Experiences

I learnt a new phrase “Consuming Experiences” analogous to “Consuming Materialism” while talking to one of the fellow travelers. Most of the people I met in Ubud had done Vipassana ten day silent meditation practice, experienced community yoga in all fancy studios of the world, done multiple yoga teachers training, done all kinds of shamanic ceremonies, unlocked their energy potential through Kundalini yoga, practiced many versions of reiki, read tarot cards to align their destinies, scaled mountains to feel connection with their deepest energies only to seek even more than their current state. That made me think that the whole energy space is also becoming counter productive and we are all in a mad rat race to gather more and more spiritual experiences and satisfy our egos (that we could challenge ourselves to go through the rigors and do it!) . We are all in a constant search to find our anchors, moving from one experience to another until we hit a point where we get tired of it, only to take a temporary break and then start our journey again.

# Living in a Bubble

All around the world, given the pace of our lives, everyone seems to be living in a bubble. Be it silicon valley — there is a different bubble centered around corporate life, go to Bali — hippies and wanderers are living in a different bubble, you come to India and you see tiers of society divided on religious lines, financial prowess, interests and all have created their own mind stories where they seek solace and meaning of life. They are losing strength to venture out in other bubbles and challenge themselves out of their own comfort zone. Some may argue what for and why to venture out so much? 7+ Billion people in the world, each living in their own mind. What’s the meaning of life — hard to say, what should be the right framework to live life, no one knows, what matters — no one knows.

# Reality of Repeat Experiences

Repeating experiences — do they give the same depth and high as when you experienced it for the first time. I came to Bali for the first time last year and was on a complete high as it introduced me to a new set of experiences and a new way of travel centered around activities that are close to my heart. I learnt new things and went back to San Francisco, dwelled more into those themes for the rest of the year. This time the same set of activities didn’t give me the same high. I was forced to either go deeper in the earlier experiences or do something different to generate new experiences. Such is the nature of spirit — always looking for something new or something deeper and repeating things don’t necessarily fulfill you in the same manner the way they do the first time.

# Hollowness of Impermanence:

Solo travel is not easy and can be emotionally volatile. After a point you crave for company and conversations. Everyone around you is also in a similar boat, craving for company and conversations with other travelers. You get to meet people from very different backgrounds. You push yourself out of your comfort zone to strike a conversation. You exchange ideas and thoughts. Most conversations are deep and intellectually stimulating. But then everything is transient. Everyone is a traveler who needs to move on to the next destination. People come and go and it’s tiring after a point to get into the same conversation with different people. You start wondering the significance of moments or experiences that don’t continue with you in future. Was it just for that moment? It makes you feel hollow but you have no choice but to make peace with it.

# My top 10 things to do in Ubud

1. **Scooter rides through rice fields**: Rent a scooter and drive aimlessly in the early mornings or late nights in the beautiful rice fields of Ubud. This is probably one of the best ways to feel the energy of this town and understand the landscape of this rustic town.
2. **Yoga or meditation at “Yoga Barn” Studio**: Ubud houses one of the most beautiful studios in the world. The bamboo design, tropical weather, open air studios elevate the joy of doing yoga in a group setting. Even if you are not into a physical yoga practice, taking a group meditation or chanting class in one of the yoga studios is highly recommended. Some of the well known yoga studios are Yoga Barn, Radiantly Alive, Intuitive Flow and you won’t be disappointed by either one of them.
3. **2 am active volcano “Mt Batur” hike** — Imagine doing a 3 hour night hike surrounded by hundreds of fellow hikers under the fully stars studded sky. Even though it’s a bit touristy experience given the number of people but a deeply satisfying and unique one.
4. **Visit to the local “Saraswati Temple”**: Most local temples are inaccessible by foreigners but there are few open temples that any one can visit. Go and check out the magnificent Saraswati temple in the main town of Ubud and enjoy a cup of Starbucks coffee across the temple which apparently is one of the most expensive sites for any Starbucks.
5. **Fresh Smoothies and Local Food at “Abe Do Warung”-** A local non touristy run by a very humble couple. Most food grown is natural and organic and you feel a distinct taste and energy especially when you are already hyper energized.
6. **Vegan desserts at “Sayuri Cafe”** — Founded by a Japanese female entrepreneur, the restaurant is hang out place for the expat population and offers delicious plant-based, mostly raw-living food, and the best raw desserts in town.
7. **Dinner or drinks at “Zest” or “Bridges”**— Some of the more happening places if you are craving for a fine dining experience. Both of these restaurants have amazing feel to them as the restaurants are surrounded by trees spiritual energy.
8. **Balinese Massages** **at “Ubud Wellness Spa 2”—** Massages are cheap in Bali (\~$10/ hour), unique and not to be missed. I discovered this non touristy place which was reasonably priced and very authentic. The other ones located in the more touristy part of the town may disappoint you.
9. **Swings in the interiors of the “Tegallalang rice fields”** — Even though this activity is becoming slightly expensive ($20 for boring touristy locations) but would suggest renting a car through a local driver who can take you in the interiors of rice fields from where you can get a non touristy experience and enjoy the swings. The price may drop to $5–10 in the interiors of the rice fields with an added authentic feel to it.
10. **Drive to “Tegenungan Waterfalls” in Gianyar —** Not far from the city, you will need to rent a local car, some beautiful waterfalls that will expose you the beauty of nature in Bali.",1,1728716071.0,ubud,0,1.0,False

Recently my family came to visit us for a week. My mom (41) is staying in our spare bedroom. My Aunt&Uncle came with their kids as well, but they are staying in a hotel. 

I told my mom that I have rules about my home, pretty simple rules, nothing over the top. No shoes on the rug, don’t eat food in the living room (drinks and snacks are fine), put your dish in the dishwasher when done, and once I go to bed the living room is shut down. By shut down I mean- do not go in it. I clean my living room before bed. Vacuum the floors, fix and vacuum the cushions, wipe down the coffee tables, ect. 

Anyways- I go out to the living room in the morning and there is a cup ring on my coffee table (I HAVE COASTERS) , the cushions are messed up, and a red sauce stain on my rug. I was livid. Mainly of the sauce stain on the rug. The rug is literally brand new, and a light beige color. I waited until my mom woke up and confronted her about the living room. She told me I was being over dramatic, the stain will come out, the rule is stupid, blah blah blah. Long story short, I told her my house, my rules and if she couldn’t go by my rules she needed to leave. So, she left and went to my aunts hotel. My aunt is blowing up my phone telling me that I am being unreasonable and they paid all the money to come see us. I told her I wasn’t being unreasonable, I have very simple rules and I just wanted to be respected in my own home. 

Am I the AH? The stain won’t come out and I am extremely disappointed. I tried to move the rug around and have the coffee table cover it, but where it’s at there’s no way to hide it. 

EDIT- never did I tell her she couldn’t exit her bedroom. I have a kitchen island that has seats and a dining room where she could have eaten- plus the bedroom she was in has a tv and a couch. 
 
Also- it takes long to clean my living room because I go through the cushions to find snacks my daughter may have dropped throughout the day. My daughter is in the stage where she puts everything in her mouth- no matter what it is and I do not want her to eat old food. She also hides her cup which normally has milk in it. Where I live mice and pests are EXTREMELY common, the last thing I’d want is mice or roaches in my home because of loose food. ",36,1728715604.0,AmItheAsshole,56,0.84,False

1g1ucg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g1ucg1/being_loyal_is_a_joke/,Being loyal is a joke,"It was an ordinary Thursday when my(27M) world turned upside down. My best friend, Adam(27M), and I had been close since our college days. We shared everything—our dreams, fears, and even our mistakes. I always admired his commitment to his wife, Sarah(28F), who was not only his partner but also a wonderful friend to me. They seemed like the perfect couple, deeply in love and supportive of each other. But that day, I uncovered a secret that would shatter that illusion.

It started innocently enough. Adam had been acting a bit distant in the weeks leading up to that Thursday. He would cancel our plans at the last minute or seem distracted when we did hang out. I chalked it up to work stress, but the nagging feeling that something was off lingered in the back of my mind.

That day, I decided to surprise him with a visit after work, hoping to lift his spirits. I arrived at his apartment and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. I waited for a few minutes, then decided to check in with Sarah, who was usually home at this hour. When I called her, she sounded confused. “Adam isn’t home? He said he was working late,” she replied, her voice tinged with concern.

My heart raced as I realized that something was seriously wrong. I told her I would keep trying to reach him and hung up. I decided to wait a little longer, figuring he might have just stepped out. After about half an hour, I noticed a car pull up near the building. It was a woman I recognized—Lisa(27F), a mutual acquaintance from our college days. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to hide behind a nearby tree to see what was happening. I watched as Lisa knocked on Adam’s door, and to my shock, he opened it with a wide grin, pulling her in for a hug. My heart sank. The way they interacted made it clear that they were more than just friends. I felt sick as I realized I was witnessing my best friend betraying his wife.

I stood frozen for a moment, grappling with the reality of what I was seeing. I had to know for sure, so I waited. After a few minutes, they emerged from the apartment, laughing and chatting as they walked toward the parking lot. I felt like I was in a nightmare. This was not the Adam I knew—the devoted husband who would never cheat on Sarah.

I knew I had to confront him, but I also didn’t want to jump to conclusions. I drove home, my mind racing with thoughts of how to approach the situation. That night, I barely slept, feeling torn between my loyalty to Adam and my obligation to Sarah.

The next day, I decided to call Adam and ask him to meet for coffee. As we sat down, I felt a mix of anger and concern bubbling inside me. “Hey, man, I’ve been worried about you. Is everything okay?” I started, trying to keep my tone casual.

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Yeah, just a lot on my mind,” he replied, avoiding eye contact. I took a deep breath and decided to dive in. “Listen, I saw you with Lisa yesterday. You two looked pretty close.” 

His expression changed, and I could see the panic in his eyes. “It’s not what you think,” he stammered. “We were just catching up.”

“Catching up?” I pressed. “Adam, you know that’s not true. You’re cheating on Sarah, aren’t you?” 

For a moment, there was silence. The weight of his actions loomed over us, and I could see the guilt washing over his face. “I didn’t want you to find out like this,” he finally admitted, his voice shaky. “I’ve made a terrible mistake.”

The conversation that followed was one of the hardest I’ve ever had. Adam explained that he had been feeling distant from Sarah for months, and in a moment of weakness, he had gotten involved with Lisa. He expressed regret and guilt, but I struggled to find sympathy for him. How could he betray someone who loved him so deeply?

I knew I had to tell Sarah. Keeping this secret would only hurt her more in the long run. I confronted Adam about it, and he begged me not to say anything, promising he would end things with Lisa. But I couldn’t sit idly by, knowing his actions would have devastating consequences.

That evening, I called Sarah and asked her to meet. My heart raced as I approached the café where we agreed to meet. When she arrived, I could see the warmth in her smile, a stark contrast to the turmoil I felt inside. After some small talk, I took a deep breath and revealed the truth.

As I recounted what I had seen, Sarah’s face fell. The shock in her eyes was palpable, and I could see the heartbreak unfolding before me. She listened in silence, tears streaming down her cheeks. It was one of the hardest moments I’ve ever experienced, knowing I had to break her heart, but I also believed she deserved the truth.

In the days that followed, Adam tried to reach out to me, but I couldn’t face him. I felt betrayed and angry. I had lost my best friend and damaged my relationship with Sarah, who was left to pick up the pieces of her shattered life. It was devastating to witness.

Eventually, Sarah decided to confront Adam herself. Their confrontation was explosive, filled with anger and hurt. In the end, she chose to end their marriage, realizing she deserved better than someone who could betray her trust so easily.",0,1728715554.0,self,5,0.29,False

1g1u3s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1g1u3s5/thank_you_everyone_in_this_sub_cw_ed_mental/,"Thank you everyone in this sub (CW: ED, Mental health, Self-harm)","I graduated in 2020 and this is my 5th attempt (and most likley final). Scored a 265. My home state is PA (270) and neighboring states of NJ and NY (266).  
I spent over $10k on exam fees, tutors, prep materials etc. Everyone in my class is making tremendous strides in their respective fields and I'm still trying to pass this exam. I tried everything i even wrote on my walls with washable markers since I'm a visual learner.  
I got laid off my clerkship in Jan and been applying to jobs ever since but **no one** will hire me without a bar passage. I can't even get a job as a server at a restaurant because im overqualified. I've been getting by my family being nice enough to throw me some pocket money here and there which is embarrasing since im 30 years old. I had to close my bank accounts because of inactivity when my unemployment ran out and I've been using only apple pay and Venmo to pay for coffee and food. I keep my phone on dnd because bill collectors are always calling me . the only good thing is that I got an offer for a contract specialist role at a nonprofit but the pay is so bad.

I wanted so badly to pass this exam and show people it could be done. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the middle of law school and it changed my brain for sure. I would stop eating during study sessions and harm myself here and there because I thought it would help me stay focused. I thought the July curve would help me. But anyways wanted to thank everyone in this sub for their support, encouragement, and resource sharing. It's the only thing that kept me somewhat sane. Thank you all and have a safe night.",5,1728714472.0,barexam,2,1.0,False
