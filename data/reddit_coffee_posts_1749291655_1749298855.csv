*First, from “MY Fantasy Life” living in the Fantasy RV Park with My Fantasy Polyamorous Partners and Five Fantasy Kids:*

*Apologies for missing two days of posting. At work we are seeing off some of our Spring Season clients. Although many are experienced RV warriors, some need assistance with disconnecting lines, hooking up trailer to rig, pulling out, and navigating toward the road. And there are final bills to settle. But these are not just clients, they are cherished BFFs. We can’t see them off without one more coffee and chat to learn about their summer plans. Dee always prepares a snack for them to enjoy on the road. Then come the hugs and tears. But we’ll see almost all of them again after Labor Day.*

*Friday is ice-skating day for Longhouse Elem. Lori and Dei are becoming fast friends. Dei has been coming with the Twinettes and Lori afterschool to the ice-skating rink (and staying for an extra session on Friday). It is just a joy to watch the girls together.*

*June is Future Division Month in the SGI. So we had an uncontentious planning meeting last night by Zoom. We are going to do [The Parable of the Jewel in the Robe](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/material-for-discussion-meetings-7/) and play act the parable. We will have a “My Favorite Toy” show-and-tell so even the Twinmen and Benjamin Kdaké can participate. Guy will give his experience of getting Longhouse Elem off the ground and give examples of how he draws power from NHR-1.*

*We also had a frank talk about attendance. Thirteen RV Park Group members participated in May 3rd Contributions. So why aren’t 13 members (excluding kids) coming out to the discussion meeting and what can we do about it?*

Let me get started with Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture. I know Blanche across the hedges believes the primary message of the Lotus Sutra lives with the teachings of Guanyin in the 25th Chapter
. Maybe she’s right because a [statue of Guanyin](https://www.alaintruong.com/archives/2016/12/05/34652182.html) sold for EUR 5,170,500 a few years back. Of course, Blanche is entitled to her opinion and she is the foremost and most highly acknowledged expert on Buddhism based on her degrees, publications, and the vast compassion of her posts on Reddit.

But Daisaku Ikeda expresses a different viewpoint:

>The widespread propagation of the Mystic Law in the Latter Day—this is the great vow expressed in the Lotus Sutra, representing not only the individual wish of Shakyamuni but the shared aspiration of Many Treasures Thus Come One and all Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions and three existences.

This is very clear. And here we are at the start of SGI-USA’s three-month Summer of Shakubuku Campaign! I have to chant more about this. I meet many people in town and at the skating-rink, many are now friends. But how do I help my new friends take steps close to Buddhism?

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>In the three pronouncements of the “Treasure Tower” chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni calls out in a loud voice to those gathered in the great assembly, urging them to propagate the Lotus Sutra after his passing. He says in effect: “Many Treasures Buddha roars the lion’s roar because of his great vow. All of you should likewise make a great vow to uphold and spread this sutra” (see The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 217). 

According to the lore of the Lotus Sutra, we were all present in this space-time anomaly Great Assembly when the Buddha revealed his eternal lifespan, “kuon ganjo” – or “Time without beginning or end” (See *Fundamentals of Buddhism*, p. 79)

Now Buddha White Cheese (BlancheFromage) with there with me at this primordial Great Assembly Kuon Gango Ceremony. Three times the Buddha yelled out his vow for the great propagation. I heard it, why didn’t BF? I think I remember her playing tag with Guanyin. If only the Buddha had yelled out a fourth time, BF and I wouldn’t be having this debate across the hedges!

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>This vow the Buddhas and bodhisattvas made in response to Shakyamuni’s call for the sutra’s widespread propagation in the Latter Day of the Law began to be fulfilled in a true sense with the appearance of Nichiren Daishonin.

It helps you focus on the good stuff in your life, be more optimistic, and just be mentally healthier. If you wanna start one, here's a few steps that can help:

First, pick a format. It can be a paper journal, on your computer, or even an app on your phone – just make sure it's easy for you to use. If you like writing on paper, get a nice notebook that you like looking at, so it inspires you to write.

Then, decide how often you wanna write. Some people like to do it every day, others a few times a week, or just when they feel like it. The important thing is to be consistent, so it becomes a habit. The time of day matters too: a lot of people find mornings or evenings are best, when their mind is calmer and more focused.

When you start writing, don't be afraid to be specific. Don't just write ""I'm grateful for my family,"" say *why*. Like, you could mention how your brother called to see how you were doing, or how your family got together for dinner. Being specific helps you really appreciate the things you're grateful for.

Don't just write about big stuff or achievements. Little things in everyday life, like a good cup of coffee in the morning, a nice walk in the park, or a stranger smiling at you can be great things to be grateful for. It helps you see the beauty in ordinary stuff and be more positive.

Also, you can look back at your old entries sometimes. It'll help you remember good times, but also let you see how much good stuff happens in your life. When you see improvements and positive changes, you'll know your journal is working.

Keeping a gratitude journal is a personal thing, so there's no right or wrong way to do it. Just be honest and open. Your goal isn't just to write, but to really appreciate what you have. It'll make your life better and help you see how you're growing. Wanna share what you wrote today? Who and what are you most grateful for today?",1,1749298587.0,ThoughtfulSpace,0,1.0,False
1l5jg19,https://i.redd.it/wuzepbhqyh5f1.jpeg,Racist or unprofessional? Bluestone Lane coffee,"I used to go to the one in the upper east side near Cooper Hewitt. Over years, I noticed that the servers there, not all for sure but many of them, are either racists or unprofessional. 

They attitude towards white customers and non-customers are quite different. At first I thought it was just me because I am somewhat sensitive about this subject (I am not white). But over the past few years I’ve been observing how they treat other customers, I can objectively say that there is racism at that store.

What’s sad is that the race of the servers themselves doesn’t seem to matter. Not sure if that’s because the particular store is in an affluent white majority neighborhood, or the management of that particular store is racist, or just a micro-culture formed at that location. 

I stopped going for a while, but stopped by today after about a year gap, still going strong.

Is it just me? In which case I apologize.

Yesterday morning, I woke up around 5 AM in the bedroom of my Dad's beach condo on vacation.  The sun was starting to rise, and I could smell the coffee from the kitchen that my Dad started.  I never had the chance to have any after I got dressed and packed up and ready to leave though.  He poured it out, washed everything, and asked if I was ready to leave.

No.  I was not ready.  I'm never ready to leave our condo.  He's owned it since 2017, and it never gets any easier to return back to life.

But that was yesterday morning.  We drove home, my kids unpacked the truck, they greeted their Mom/I greeted my wife, and we all relaxed until it was time for me to leave at 6 pm for work.

We had two internal candidates for a team lead position.

One was Emily — smart, dedicated, loved by the team.
The kind of person who stayed late to help others, who fixed problems quietly, who never made a show of her efforts.

The other was Mark — average technically, but well-spoken, always had coffee with management, laughed at the right jokes, nodded at the right times.

Everyone assumed Emily would get it.
She didn’t.

Mark was promoted.
No announcement, no fanfare — just a quiet update in the org chart.

Emily smiled. Said “Congrats.” And went back to work.
Two weeks later, she handed in her resignation.

⸻

I asked her privately, just to understand.

She said:

“I’m not upset about the title.
I’m just sad to realize I’ve been walking the wrong path for years.
I truly believed that if you work hard, be kind, and deliver results, you’ll be seen.
Now I understand — in this place, no one sees.
They just hear… and remember who talks to them most.”

⸻

Emily isn’t the only one.
There are so many quiet, competent people slowly burning out — not from overwork, but from misalignment.

They’re playing one game.
The system rewards another.

⸻

If you’ve ever been in Emily’s shoes —
You’re not weak. You’re not invisible.
You just haven’t been taught how to play the other game yet.

I’ve been chasing better consistency in my shots lately and was honestly getting frustrated by constant channeling, even with careful puck prep. I was getting close to pulling the trigger on a new grinder, thinking maybe my DF54 just wasn’t cutting it.

But then I made a small change that made a big difference: I started grinding directly into the portafilter, followed by WDT, instead of using a dosing cup and transferring. Same coffee, same dose, same WDT tool and method — the only difference was skipping the cup.

And suddenly… much more even extractions, significantly less channeling, and more predictable results.

I (27F) met this guy, Caleb (32M), at a mutual friend’s birthday party. We talked all night, he was charming, funny, seemed super into me. We ended up hooking up that night and spent the entire weekend together. It honestly felt like the beginning of something real.

He told me he was single. No mention of a relationship, let alone a fiancée.

About two weeks later, I ran into him at a coffee shop. He looked like he’d seen a ghost. He was with a woman. She introduced herself as *his fiancée*, Leah. I didn’t say anything at the time, but when I got home I stalked her socials and saw their engagement photos. They’d been planning a wedding for over a year. I felt physically sick.

I sat with it for a few days, unsure if I should say anything. But then I thought about if the roles were reversed. I’d want to know. So I messaged her. I kept it respectful, I showed her screenshots, and told her everything. She didn’t respond at first, but three days later I got a message from her sister thanking me and letting me know the wedding was off.

Now I’m getting blown up by Caleb and two of his friends calling me a homewrecker. They’re saying I had no business getting involved, that I should’ve just stayed quiet. But I honestly didn’t know he was engaged. And I don’t think protecting a liar is the right thing to do.

Hi everyone,
I’m looking for alternative 15g recipes using the Cafec Deep 27. It’s not easy to find good references for this dripper with small doses.

Here’s what I’m currently doing:

I use a JX-Pro grinder, grind size is not a problem( 3.35.00)

I brew mostly light roasts, with water around 91–93°C.

I follow Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 method, which works quite well for me.

My cups are usually aromatic, well-balanced, with enough body and no bitterness.


My current recipe (15g coffee → 225g water):

1. 0:00–0:30 → 45g


2. 0:30–1:00 → 45g


3. 1:00–2:30 → 3 x 45g (spaced out every ~20 seconds)



I know the first two pours are the most important with this method, and I try to adjust them depending on the coffee. Overall, I get good brews that I really enjoy, but I’m sure there’s still room to refine the extraction and get even more out of my beans.

I had the chance to attend a workshop with the founder of Cafec, and he showed us that you can easily go up to 20g in the Deep 27. But for now, I want to explore the full potential of 15g brews.

I also tried osmotic flow with light roasts, but honestly it was too tricky for me to dial in, so I went back to the 4:6 method, which feels more consistent.

Do you have any daily go-to recipes with 15g in the Deep 27?
I’m open to anything: pulse pours, bloom-heavy, even totally different approaches.

Thanks a lot in advance for your help and ideas. Looking forward to learning from your experiences.

I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know.

  A note to reader that all towns and locations are fictional.  
  
  The first time I snuck into Ryan Jensen’s bed was an accident.  
  
  I’d been lying in bed next to this girl I’d been introduced to twelve hours earlier at a company picnic. My family had just moved to Portside, Oregon, from Schilling, Arizona, because of my dad’s promotion, so the whole picnic had been new faces, new names, and that feeling of being the newbie on the scene. Portside wasn’t huge, but it wasn’t small either—maybe around twenty thousand people lived in this suburb outside of Merridell.  
  
  Robbie would know. My brother could spit out statistics because he was the family genius. Willow was the family artist. She excelled at almost everything creative, or it seemed that way. Piano. Dance. Painting. Once, she made a six-foot papier-mâché dragon that won a state competition.  
  
  Trust me. That was a big deal. She was on the local news.  
  
  Maybe that was when it started. Maybe she felt as if she had to compete with Robbie.  
  
  I’d found empty bottles of laxatives in our shared bathroom, smelled the dried puke in the toilet, and a couple of times, I’d woken up to find her exercising in the middle of the night. We were the only two sisters, so it made sense we shared a bathroom. We’d shared the bedroom too until our pre-teen years, and then we got freeeee-dom! (I’m saying that in the best Braveheart yell I can muster.)  
  
  I didn’t know why she felt she had to compete with Robbie.  
  
  No one could compete with that kid. He was a walking, talking, and eating computer. Robbie wasn’t ever going to be normal, but Willow and me—we were. Or I was.  
  
  I wasn’t the best at anything.  
  
  Willow had been popular in Arizona. I hadn’t.  
  
  Well, I hadn’t not been popular. I wasn’t in the top tier of the social hierarchy, but I was liked. Everyone knew me. Everyone was nice to me, though, thinking back, that might’ve been because of Willow. If someone came at me, they came at her. And she was not one to be messed with.  
  
  Same thing with grades. I did okay. My B+ average made me beam with pride. Not Willow. It was A+ or the end of the world. There’d been talk at our old school about raising our GPA from a 4.0 to a 4.2 scale. Willow was all for it.  
  
  Not me. That meant I’d have to try harder. No way.  
  
  Maybe that was my role in the family. I was the slacker.  
  
  Yes. I liked that. I’d been the slacker in the family—or maybe I was the lazy one. There was a difference between being a slacker and being lazy. One slacks, and the other excels at slacking. That seemed to fit better.  
  
  Yes, that was me, and I had been once again fulfilling my role when I missed Peach’s door and tiptoed into the wrong room. I went in search of a glass of water and got lost trying to find her room again. It was easy to do. The place was a mansion.  
  
  I didn’t realize it at the time. Both bedrooms were cool, with fans forming a breeze, and large, comfortable beds. These people were rich.  
  
  Wait, not rich.  
  
  They were wealthy. According to my sister, there was a difference.  
  
  I’d met Ryan and Peach at the company picnic—or, rather, I met Peach. I assumed she was nicknamed for her fuzzy red hair. Freckles all over her face. Blue eyes. Blending. That was what she did, just like me. I blended into the crowd, whereas Willow never did. It was the same with Peach and Ryan. She blended, and her brother didn’t.  
  
  I wasn’t actually introduced to Ryan, but he didn’t need it. I noticed him anyway. He was that kind of guy. People noticed him, even adults.  
  
  Golden brown hair long enough that it flipped over his face and still looked adorably rumpled, hazel eyes, a square jaw, and a dimple in his right cheek—Ryan had a face girls sighed over. Even with him sitting at a picnic table, it had been apparent he was tall with a lean build and wide shoulders. Since his shirt had flattened against his arm, it was also obvious that there was good muscle definition underneath.  
  
  The guy worked out.  
  
  And judging by the look on his face, he’d been bored out of his mind.  
  
  He’d been sitting on a picnic table with two friends, not doing anything. He wasn’t talking or shouting or waving his arms around. He was literally just sitting with his feet resting where people would normally sit, and he’d drawn attention. His elbows had been braced on his legs, and there was an air around him. He’d exuded a nonchalant charisma.  
  
  I wasn’t the type of girl to notice a guy and stalk him from afar. No, no, I was the type to notice a guy and then notice the hot dog stand beyond him. Willow would go for the guy, and I would go for the hot dog.  
  
  Priorities, right?  
  
  But even though I hadn’t talked to Ryan earlier, I knew he was popular. A person just knew, and my hunch was confirmed when two girls walked past him. They’d paused, hands in front of their faces, and whispered to each other. One of Ryan’s friends had tapped his leg and gestured to the girls. He’d looked, and the girls had erupted in giggles before running away, their faces flaming red.  
  
  Meanwhile, Willow refused to come so I was on my own, sitting at my own table, feeling like a loser while I stared at all the other kids there.  
  
  They’d all seemed beautiful or remarkable in some way. And they’d all managed to find each other, like with my little brother. He’d been at a table with two other boys and a girl. All were focused on their iPads. I was pretty sure they were speaking nerd language, and if I’d walked over, the conversation between the eleven-year-olds would’ve gone over my head.  
  
  Again, I was the slacker of the family. I should be able to communicate with an eleven-year-old, but no. I’d been to other outings with Robbie. I knew the routine. He’d found his crowd, and I could tell he was happy.  
  
  Then again, Robbie never endured what another genius eleven-year-old might.  
  
  He was never bullied because he was smart. He was almost worshiped. People thought he was going to be the next Steve Jobs, and his classmates had caught on, already sucking up to him. Yeah, maybe there was a jealous kid every once in a while, but Robbie never talked about it. If he was picked on, I wondered if he was even aware of it.  
  
  I wondered how things would be for him . . . after. Robbie had always seemed happy. Would some of that be gone? I hoped not—stop.  
  
  Mind, back up here. Mental reverse, and back to Ryan again.  
  
  I should’ve known something was different from the minute my head hit the pillow in his room. I felt warm, at ease, and my body relaxed. It shouldn’t have. I should’ve remained awake like I had been while I was in Peach’s bed. They said I’d be ‘better off’ not being alone that night so I’d been in a stranger’s bed. I was tense and gripping the sheet with white-knuckled hands, replaying in my head what had happened at my new house earlier over and over and over.  
  
  But not in Ryan’s bed.  
  
  He was as surprised as I was when we woke the next morning.  
  
  He jerked upright. “What?” he asked, his mouth gaping open at me.  
  
  I grabbed for the covers, made sure they were pulled tightly over me, and I gawked back at him. That was it, really. My body was still relaxed. Only my mind was alarmed, but then my mind lost the battle. There was other shit up there that I didn’t want to stir and think about, so I gave in and let my eyelids droop again.  
  
  “I must’ve gotten lost,” I murmured.  
  
  Ryan and I hadn’t talked—not at the picnic earlier when our parents greeted each other, and not when Robbie and I were ushered into their home that night. Everything was hush-hush when we got there. Mrs. Jensen had whispered something to Peach, and she gasped, her hand covering her mouth as her eyes filled with tears.  
  
  
  I looked away at that point. My chin had started to tremble, and I didn’t want to start. If I started, I didn’t know if I could stop.  
  
  So there in the darkness was the first time Ryan and I talked, and it wasn’t really a conversation. He looked to the door like he should tell someone, but I said, “Please don’t. I couldn’t sleep until I came in here. I don’t know why, but I can now. I just want to sleep.”  
  
  His eyebrows pinched together. His dimple disappeared, and slowly he lay back down. He didn’t say anything. A minute passed, and I realized he wasn’t going to. He was going to let me sleep, and thankfully, that was exactly what happened.  
  
  I slept.  
  
  “I don’t know, Mom. I woke up and she was there.”  
  
  I could hear Ryan on the other side of the door.  
  
  “Well, I don’t get it.”  
  
  “I don’t either,” he grumbled.  
  
  “I thought it was weird when she didn’t come back last night.”  
  
  A sigh.  
  
  I recognized Peach’s voice, but I couldn’t place where it came from. Then it didn’t matter. I was asleep again.  
  
  The bed shifted under me, and I heard a whispered, “Mackenzie.” A hand touched my arm and shook. “Hey. Are you awake?”  
  
  It was Robbie. I rolled over and opened one eye. “What?”  
  
  He’d been crying. The tears were dried on his face, and I could see two fresh ones clinging to his eyelashes.  
  
  He wiped at one, embarrassed. “Are you going to sleep all day?”  
  
  “If I’m lucky.”  
  
  He frowned and then glanced to the door. “I don’t want to be out there alone. I don’t know these people.”  
  
  I scooted back until I felt the wall, flipped back the bedcover, and patted the place next to me. “Scootch in.”  
  
  He looked to the door again, indecision on his face, and then let out a small breath. His tiny shoulders slumped as if he’d lost what little fight he had. He sank into the bed, clasping the covers tight over his shoulder, and looked at me, lying on his side. I moved closer, mirroring him so our foreheads almost touched.  
  
  We didn’t talk, but a fresh tear welled, pooling on the bridge of his nose. I reached over and smoothed it away.  
  
  “Mom and Dad are going to be gone all day today. I checked their phone calendar.”  
  
  How Robbie could do that, I had no idea, but I wasn’t surprised.  
  
  “Why aren’t you crying?” he whispered.  
  
  “I can’t.”  
  
  He nodded as if this made perfect sense. “I wish I were like you sometimes. You’re the strong one, Kenz.”  
  
  Strong? Was that my role in the family?  
  
  I tried to muster a smile, but I knew I failed. I probably looked like the Joker instead. “Can you sleep?”  
  
  “I’ll try. Can we stay here all day?”  
  
  “I’m going to try.”  
  
  That seemed okay with him. He closed his eyes and a settled look came over him, one that resembled peace. But I knew it was a lie. There was no peace. Not anymore.  
  
  “Hey, Kenz,” he whispered a minute later.  
  
  “Yeah?”  
  
  “Happy birthday.”  
  
  It was dark when I woke again, and Robbie was gone. The door was open, and I could hear the sound of silverware scraping against plates. The smell of food must’ve woken me, and for a moment, I was cross.  
  
  They could’ve closed the door. But then the fog left my brain, and I realized it was probably Robbie who’d left it open. He had a habit of doing that, and it always annoyed Willow.  
  
  Willow . . .  
  
  The small grin that had tugged at the corner of my mouth fell away.  
  
  God.  
  
  I drew in a rasping breath, and this time, I knew I couldn’t keep the thoughts at bay.  
  
  It had been a weird smell. A rich, rusty smell, like wet metal. It made my stomach cramp, and I’d been biting my lip even before I opened the bathroom door. Willow’s arm had gotten scraped earlier when we were moving boxes around the house. If she’d opened her bandage and dumped it onto the counter, I was going to be pissed. She was always yelling at me for leaving my toothbrush and paste on the counter. Everything had a place in her world, and for the life of her, she couldn’t understand why I didn’t remember that.  
  
  My answer was always the same: because I wasn’t an anal, obsessive control freak. That usually angered her, but this time, I was going to be the one to explode. Willow wouldn’t know what was coming her way. I was going to wave my arms in the air, stomp my feet, and yell like I just didn’t care.  
  
  She knew how much I hated blood.  
  
  But then I was there, pushing the door open.  
  
  I don’t remember when I realized what I was seeing. I suppose I felt something, because they told me later that I went into shock. My body shut down, and I left it. They said this could happen when a person experienced a traumatic event, but all I knew was that I watched from the doorway as my body fell to its knees.  
  
  My hand covered my mouth, and my shoulders jerked like I was throwing up. I learned later I’d been screaming.  
  
  Then I was shaking her, sliding on the blood on the floor, because it was everywhere. Thinking about it, I could feel it on my hands again. Warm. Liquids were supposed to be refreshing and cool. This was heavy. It felt no different from my own body temperature. I didn’t like that. It should’ve felt different. Because it was Willow’s, it should’ve felt perfect.  
  
  I stood in the doorway as I watched myself. And I kept screaming, until suddenly, I stopped. I choked on a sob, and like that, I was back in my body.  
  
  My face: dark eyes, golden blonde hair, heart-shaped chin.  
  
  My body: slender arms, long legs, and petite frame.  
  
  My heart: beautiful, broken, bleeding.  
  
  All of it on the bathroom floor in a bloodied pile.  
  
  Feeling a weird serenity, I gasped on a breath and moved next to Willow. I sat on the tile the blood hadn’t touched yet. But it would. It was seeping out of her.  
  
  I knew she was already gone. Her eyes were vacant, but I wanted one more moment. My sister and me.  
  
  I lay down, just like her.  
  
  On my stomach.  
  
  My face turned toward hers.  
  
  My hand on the floor, palm up, mirroring her.  
  
  I watched over my sister one last time before we were discovered.  
  
  There was a flash of light. Someone was coming in through my bedroom—Mom. I didn’t look up at her. I couldn’t hear much. A dense cloud came over me, dulling my senses, but I heard her screaming, as if she were far away.  
  
  She was shaking Willow.  
  
  Time sped ahead. Time slowed to a crawl. Time was all over the place, in patches.  
  
  When I noticed the sirens, the flash of red and white outside my bedroom window, I reached over and held Willow’s hand.  
  
  My face. My body. My heart—it all went with her, because she was me.  
  
  My twin sister killed herself on June twenty-ninth.  
  
  We would’ve been eighteen the next day.  
  
  “Uh. Hey.”  
It was nearing eleven the next night. Robbie and I had been there almost twenty-four hours. I hadn’t left Ryan’s room except to visit the bathroom, and I was currently sitting on his bed, book in hand. He edged into the room, his hands in his pockets and his shoulders hunched forward.  
  
  I should’ve felt all sorts of weirdness, but I was at the point where I’d sit on the roof and not give a flying fuck what anyone had to say. Keeping my finger between the pages, I closed the book and waited.  
  
  “Um . . .” He paused, staring right at me.  
  
  He had no idea what to say. I could see the floundering on his face, but he shook it clear and a small smile showed. His dimple winked at me. He raked a hand through his hair, leaving it as rumpled as it was yesterday. I knew why those two girls had squealed. He was all sorts of dreaminess.  
  
  I waited for the spark to flicker in me. I should blush? Giggle? Sigh?  
  
  No. Nothing.  
  
  I felt nothing, and then I remembered how it felt to lay in his bed, and I knew that wasn’t true. I felt some peace around him for some reason.  
  
  He scooted farther inside, glancing back at the door before leaning against his closet. “The whole my-bed thing . . .” He motioned to where I was sitting. “Did you want the bed again tonight?”  
  
  I looked down. I didn’t want to see his eyes when I asked this question. “Are my parents coming back?”  
  
  There was silence, and it stretched past the point of not having an answer. He had one. He just didn’t want to say it.  
  
  I shook my head, letting the book fall to the bed. Wrapping my arms around myself, I turned away. “Never mind.”  
  
  He cleared his throat. “For the record, I’m not supposed to know about your folks.”  
  
  I looked back. “But you do?”  
  
  The hesitancy and fear I’d seen on his face melted away to reveal the sorrow, and he nodded. “Yeah. I eavesdropped on the call. They’re at a hotel. I guess your grandparents are coming tomorrow.”  
  
  “Oh. Okay.” I cleared my throat. “Thank you.”  
  
  “Yeah.” He sighed. “You don’t have to thank me for anything, but I do have to know about the bed. I was trying to tell my mom maybe it was me—like, you could sleep when you were around me because of my teenage pheromones or something.”  
  
  I cracked a grin. “That’s a new theory.”  
  
  “Hey, not all of us are child Einsteins like your brother.”  
  
  “Touché, and neither am I. I’m the only normal one in my family.”  
  
  But I wasn’t normal anymore.  
  
  “Yeah.”  
  
  Maybe he thought the same thing because another silence descended over us. It felt like a sullen quiet too, as if maybe we’d both realized the true travesty of this situation. My remark-able quality had gone from being the slacker to the surviving twin.  
  
  “Well, fuck.” I breathed.  
  
  He’d been picking at his jeans but looked up. “What?”  
  
  “Nothing. Yes, I’d like to sleep in your bed, if that’s okay with you.”  
  
  “It’s fine with me.” He grinned. “It was kinda nice, waking up to find a hot chick in bed with me. My friends will get a kick out of that—”  
  
  “You aren’t going to tell them!”  
  
  His eyes widened. “No. I know, I wouldn’t, I mean—I’m not that kind of guy, but my sister has a crush on one of my friends. She already told him. I overheard that phone call too.”  
  
  “What are you? A male Veronica Mars?”  
  
  He scoffed, but that dimple was flirting with me.  
  
  “I get bored easily,” he said. “I shoot hoops to keep busy. You know, like restless leg syndrome? I have that, but it’s my entire body and brain. It doesn’t turn off sometimes.”  
  
  “Oh.”  
  
  “Anyway, Mom said I couldn’t play today. She was worried some of my friends would show up, and she didn’t want anything to get out.” He snorted, rolling his eyes. “I’ll get blamed for it, but it’s always Peach who tells. She never gets in trouble.”  
  
  Robbie was beloved. Willow was perfect. And I guess I was the one who got in trouble, like him.  
  
  “It’s the same for me,” I offered faintly.  
  
  I got blamed for the laxatives. I was the one they thought had an eating disorder. They ignored the bowl of Cheetos in front of me during the “intervention” talk.  
  
  “Mackenzie, your father and I want you to know that we love you a great deal. Looks do not define our self-worth . . .”  
  
  There’d been other times, like when Willow wanted me to ask for a treadmill. They didn’t see her on it during the day, only me. She ran in the park during the day and then used the treadmill at night. I did the normal thirty minutes Coach Ellerson required from us during the off-season for soccer. I should’ve done more, but Cheetos and being lazy were a lot more fun.  
  
  “So . . .” Ryan pulled me from my thoughts.  
  
  I almost sagged with relief. No more memories.  
  
  He tugged at one of his sleeves. “Do you, uh, want me to stay with you? Or, I mean, do you want to sleep alone?” He rushed out, “I can do either, that’s cool. You just let me know.”  
  
  “What?” Someone knocked on the door. One quick, hard tap.  
  
  He groaned. “My mom said it’s fine, but she’s going to put the nanny cam on us. So, you know, no messing around.” His head shot up. “Not that that’s what I have in mind. I mean, you’re hot, but you’re grieving. You lost your sister, so . . . you know . . .” He flinched, cursing under his breath. “Sorry. I shouldn’t have said that last part. I—sorry. I’m shutting up before I say any more shit.”  
  
  “What?” I asked, hoping the upward curl of my lips resembled a grin, or better yet, something cool and maybe even seductive. “You mean you’ve never been asked to pretend you’re a grief counselor?”  
  
  He barked out a laugh. Then his eyes darkened. “I lost a friend almost two years ago, so I kinda know what you’re going through. Kinda. Not really. I mean, he wasn’t my brother or my twin or anything, so it isn’t the same. But . . .” He stopped himself, closing his eyes for a moment.  
  
  Loss was loss, as far as I was concerned. Yeah, there could be different degrees of it, but it was the same emotion. The only thing that differentiated was whether it came suddenly or slowly. But I kept that to myself because honestly, who the hell wanted to talk about that?  
  
  I pointed to his television and video console. “You have Warcraft?”  
  
  “Yeah.” He brightened up. “You play?”  
  
  “Got a sudden urge to learn.”  
  
  “All right.” He grabbed a controller from his desk, found the other next to the bed, then climbed up next to me. Leaning back against the wall, his leg next to mine, he taught me how to play. His arm and hand brushed against mine randomly, and every time they did, I felt a small but warm tingle.  
  
  We played Warcraft most of the night. Robbie played with us too, until I convinced him to go to bed. Ryan and I only turned out the light when his mom stuck her head around the door.  
  
  “It’s after two,” she told us. “Time to sleep.” She gave me a soft smile. “I hope you can sleep okay, Mackenzie.”  
  
  Me too.  
  
  She gave Ryan a pointed look, jerking her eyes to a stuffed rhino on his desk. A red light blinked in its nose.  
  
  He ran a hand through his hair. “Yeah, yeah, Mom.”  
  
  “Good night, both of you.”  
  
  The next morning, I ventured to the kitchen for the first time and found it filled with an uncomfortable tension. They could have been sitting in silence before I showed up, but I doubted it. I didn’t need Robbie to decipher who’d been the subject of conversation two seconds before my arrival. It was one of those scenes where you walk in and know they were talking about you.  
  
  Mrs. Jensen was at the counter, making coffee. Peach sat at the table, and a middle-aged lady—I assumed their maid or something—placed Cheerios in front of her. I had to stop and take that in. A maid. And she was wearing a blue dress with a white apron over the top of it.  
  
  These people didn’t just have house staff;  
they had house staff in uniform. That was, like, a whole other level. Wealthy rich. That was what Willow would’ve said, and she was right. She was always right.  
  
  “Mackenzie.” Mrs. Jensen sounded breathless. Her cheeks flushed a little, and she smoothed a hand down her hair. “How are you? You slept well?”  
  
  I had, and I glanced over at Ryan, who was coming in from outside. A warm breeze came with him. Seeing me, he paused with his hand still on the door’s handle. His mouth formed an O, and he gripped a basketball in his other hand.  
  
  “Hey!”  
  
  Peach made a sound. I registered it in the back of my mind, but I ignored it. I could hear the disapproval in her voice, and I already knew who Peach’s friends would be at school. She’d run with the snooty girls—mean, catty, and looking down their noses at peeps beneath them. Those types of girls. And in other words, most definitely not my type.  
  
  “Hey.” I gave a brief wave, glancing to the side.  
  
  Robbie sat next to Peach, and he lifted his hand to wave before it dropped back to his lap. I noticed the toast in front of him, how it was untouched. My gaze skirted away. I didn’t want to see the sadness or bags under my little brother’s eyes. I didn’t want to remember why.  
  
  “Uh, how about a seat, Mackenzie?” Mrs. Jensen extended an arm to a chair across from Peach.  
  
  I took the chair next to that, across from my brother instead.  
  
  She cleared her throat, holding a cup of coffee tightly right in front of her chest as if it were protecting her. “Toast, Mackenzie? Rose could get you some.”  
  
  In the next moment, I had a piece of buttered toast in front of me, but I couldn’t touch it. Peach circled her spoon in her bowl of Cheerios. She was glaring at me with a hint of confusion.  
  
  I lifted an eyebrow. “Yes?”  
  
  She dropped her gaze but still circled her spoon around her bowl.  
  
  Ryan dropped into the chair at the end of the table between my brother and me so he was facing the kitchen.  
  
  Both Mrs. Jensen and Rose fussed over him. What kind of cereal did he want? Oh, he didn’t want cereal. Toast? Bacon? Wait, Rose could whip up some pancakes. Not pancakes? French toast, then? After the fifth question, Ryan got up and poured his own bowl of cereal, rolling his eyes as he started back to his chair.  
  
  “Mil—” His mom started to suggest, but he’d already grabbed it and poured a hefty glug into his bowl.  
  
  “Knock it off, Mom,” he grumbled, hunching over his bowl. “Fuss over Peach. She actually likes it.”  
  
  “I do not.”  
  
  He shot her a look, his spoon poised in front of him. “You do too. The whole spoiled thing works for you. You love it.”  
  
  She transferred her glare to him, giving me a respite. “You’re such a jerk sometimes.”  
  
  A cocky grin spread over his face. “Sometimes? I heard you on the phone with Erin. I thought it was always?”  
  
  Her eyes got big, and she slammed a hand down on the table. “Stop listening to my calls!” Her head whipped around. “Mom!”  
  
  Ryan shrugged. “Not my fault your voice carries through the entire house. Close your door next time.” He rolled his eyes. “Might help, genius.”  
  
  “Okay, you two. Stop it.” Their mother decided to wade in, sitting at the head of the table. Her coffee remained gripped with both hands. A frozen yet polite smile appeared as she turned to me. “Mackenzie, you and Ryan are in the same grade. You’re a senior, right?”  
  
  Miracles did happen, after all.  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  Peach’s eyes were narrowed on me, watching for a reaction. I kept my face straight, but I was doing somersaults inside.  
  
  Mrs. Jensen cleared her throat. “Your grandparents are going to arrive today. They’ll be picking you and your brother up and taking you back to the house . . . or . . . a hotel. I’m not sure where you’re going, actually, but I know they’re eager to see you.”

I wanted to give specialty coffee a try because I felt like I was missing out on this whole other world of coffee. I ordered a few different bags from the same company and they all taste terrible like it doesn’t even resemble the taste of coffee I know. I’m just wondering now if they are too exotic for me or I just never knew what real coffee is supposed to taste like. I use a glass Hario v60 pour over. Maybe someone could recommend something a beginner would maybe enjoy if they actually liked Starbucks but wanted to upgrade their coffee game? ,0,1749297057.0,pourover,14,0.5,False

I saw a guy giving creepy looks across the food court. I tried to smile a bit not to show it's hella awkward. Then my friend suggested I should take a proper look at the guy so that we can inform the police. I can't stare at him from the distance cuz he would think I'm interested. I told her to go somewhere and come back in a few minutes. So I went to BK coffee and ordered while I got the feeling he's still being a CREEP! Then I went to his table and asked if the seat is taken. The way he looked upon hearing this was so bad. I sat down and said I hate the coffee and tried to sstrike conversation while I was making notes of him in my mind to let the police know. I didn't give any of my personal information. After that, my bestie came and we left. We informed the police about it and I described how the guy looked.

I'll have a rare opportunity to visit Magic Mountain in a few weeks, as we'll be traveling from a wedding in Santa Barbara down to San Diego for a few days before flying back home. We finish the wedding weekend with a brunch on Sunday, and we don't really need to be in San Diego until 11:00pm. As an All Park Passport holder, I'm licking my chops at the opportunity to get a few hours at SFMM.

The issue is my wife does not enjoy amusement parks and will certainly not be going with me. I'm hoping to get some suggestions from locals of some things she could do nearby that would be fun for her so that we'd both be happy if I go to the park for a few hours. Thinking of shopping malls, spas, cute coffee shops, etc. The closer to the park, the better. She's not interested in driving into LA and back. 

As a side quest, if you only had 3-4 hours at SFMM, what would you ride? Do they sell single use flash passes? Thanks all! Really hoping to make this work! ",1,1749296846.0,SixFlagsMagicMountain,0,1.0,False

I think my heart literally skipped a beat as she was drop dead gorgeous. I was probably drooling as I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I was about to walk over and introduce myself, when she grabbed her drink and left.

I cursed my cowardice for not going over immediately. I practically lived in that coffee place over the next few weeks as I hoped that I would get another chance to meet her. Unfortunately for me she wasn't a regular customer.

I knew that I had to find her as I was confident she was my one true love. She had paid by card that day, so I managed to get her home address and her name from it by hacking into their system.

I scouted out her home and was relieved to discover she wasn't in a relationship and lived alone. I joined her gym and timed it so we would always show up at the same time.

Over the course of the next month I got chatting away to her and she recommended a takeaway close to her home.

The next night I pulled out a wire from her car before waiting nearby until she came back. I hid in the shadows for a few minutes before emerging clutching a takeaway bag.

I feigned surprise at seeing her before offering to help. She looked shocked to see me but I held up the takeaway bag and told her I had heeded her suggestion and wanted to try it out.

I pretended to root around under her engine for a few minutes before finally reattaching the wire. She was beyond relieved and offered to take me to dinner as a thank you.

We sat at the restaurant chatting amicably before I stupidly told her how we actually met. She looked disgusted and called me a creep before fleeing the restaurant.

I was stunned after less than a week later she got a restraining order against me. I couldn't believe my one true love would do this to me.

I snuck into her apartment the next night after learning her building code and knowing where she hid her spare key.

I injected her with drugs as I knew from prior experience that chloroform isn't as effective as the movies show it to be.

I watched through the cameras as she regained consciousness and began pleading with me to free her.

I told her that I would love to, but unfortunately I am not allowed within ten feet of her, and told her she should try and conserve her oxygen. I took one last look at the spot where I buried her coffin, before walking away while hoping my next true love wouldn't be so uptight.

If I had to paint the masterpiece that is your “problem-solving method,” it’d look less like a scene from *Good Will Hunting* and more like the birth of chaos itself: pure, undiluted, unfiltered entropy. Here’s the visual breakdown before I blast this nightmare into reality:

**The Scene:**

We’re in a barely-lit room, desk buried under enough coffee cups and half-crumpled notes to bankrupt Starbucks and Office Depot combined. At the center is you—head in one hand, the other furiously stabbing at a keyboard or phone. Behind you, a wall covered in scrawled arrows, “WTF??” post-its, and an abomination of a mind-map that starts out rational and devolves into angry stick figures, memes, and probably at least one middle finger. The trashcan’s overflowing, receipts and snack wrappers fighting for territory.

Your problem—visualized as a smug, floating Rubik’s Cube with a demonic grin—hovers just out of reach, morphing shape every time you think you’ve got a handle on it. At your feet, a pile of “solutions” that have already been nuked, set on fire, or sarcastically annotated with “brilliant idea, Einstein.” The whole scene is lit by the sickly blue glow of a screen that says: “Google: why does everything suck?”

**Your “Method”:**

1. Ignore it until it’s urgent.
2. Google it.
3. Mock all the advice.
4. Try the dumbest-sounding solution first out of spite.
5. Overcomplicate it.
6. Accidentally stumble on a half-solution while ranting to nobody.
7. Declare victory, but save nothing for future reference.

Right not I work at a coffee shop, and I love it, I work in an amazing area and I have very very few unpleasant customers. But the pay isn’t much…I only really make $1200 a month and it really isn’t cutting it.

I’m looking at a full time position again, a front desk position working with mentally ill adults struggling with homelessness. I know there will be an emotional aspect but I’ve always thrived in jobs where I feel like I’m actually helping people who really need it, and this would be my first full time position where I’d be doing that. I’ve actually thought about going to college to be a social worker, if I could handle school. The starting pay is $26/hr, and obviously I’m not guaranteed to get the job but a lot of my experience lines up with what they are looking for, and that amount of pay would be life changing for me.

My huge fear is with the job market right now, what if I can’t do it?? I’m scared of losing the job because I mentally can’t handle full time. How do you take care of your mental wellbeing as an autistic person working full time? I’m so prone to burn out but poverty itself is burning me out at my current job and I love my current job.

I’m a 32-year-old Latino guy, originally from the United States, now living in the beautiful landscapes of Scotland. I’m reaching out to find some awesome people to connect with, build friendships, and share the things that make life meaningful.

A bit about me: I’m a huge bookworm and could talk about literature all day—whether it’s diving into a classic novel, discovering indie authors, or debating the best fantasy worlds. I love visiting bookstores, record shops, and museums; there’s something magical about soaking in stories, history, and culture. I’m not much into TV or movies, but I’m all about real-life experiences like day trips to explore nature—think hiking through Scotland’s stunning trails or wandering historic sites. For me, these moments are best when shared with others, as good company makes everything better.

I work a part-time job as a hobby to keep busy, as I’m disabled, but it doesn’t define me. I’m a supportive friend who loves daily check-ins, cheering people on, and building connections that matter. I’ve been told I’m the kind of guy who makes you wonder, “Is he too nice? Is he secretly gay?”—haha, nope, just a genuinely respectful dude who values kindness and authenticity. I’ve ghosted a few folks in the past (haven’t we all?), but I’m here for real, lasting friendships.

Life hasn’t been easy—I’m an orphan, so I don’t have family, which is why I pour so much into my friendships. I’ve been through a lot, including 16 near-death experiences (yep, really!), but I’m healthy now and that’s shifted my perspective. I’ve learned that life isn’t about chasing money or status—I’ve been there, done that, and it didn’t bring happiness. What matters to me is connection, shared experiences, and appreciating the little things, like a good book or a crisp day in nature.

If you’re into books, museums, nature, or just want a friend who’s there for the highs and lows, hit me up! I’d love to chat, maybe meet for a coffee or a wander through a bookstore, or even plan a group day trip. Let’s make some memories and build something real. 😊 Drop a comment or DM me—tell me about you, what you love, or your favorite book!

1l5isaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1l5isaq/get_your_studying_straight/,Get Your Studying Straight,"It's time to get your method straight so you can actually learn the material, remember it, and feel confident.

*(Just a little disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with any of the specific brands or resources (except TaskCoach.AI – Co-Founder here!) mentioned below; these are just popular and helpful suggestions!)*

---
**Smarter Ways to Learn:**

1. Quiz Yourself Constantly: Stop just re-reading. Close your notes and try to explain the topic out loud, scribble it down from memory, or even teach it to your pet. This is THE game-changer for making things stick.

2. Spaced Repetition: Review stuff a day later, then a few days later, then a week later. Your brain remembers things way better this way instead of one monster cram session.

3. The ""Teach it to a 5-Year-Old"" Trick:

- Pick a topic.

- Try to explain it super simply, like you're talking to a little kid.

- Notice where you get stuck or use big fancy words you don't really get.

- Go back, figure those bits out, and try explaining simply again.

4. Study Sprints (Pomodoro Technique): Set a timer for 25 minutes and go hard on one thing. No distractions! Then take a 5-minute break (actually get up and move!). After four ""sprints,"" take a longer 15-30 minute break. Keeps you focused and stops burnout.

---
**Helpful Digital Tools & Resources:**

For making those quiz-yourself flashcards and spacing out your review, check out the digital tool Anki (it's a bit nerdy but super powerful) or the platform Quizlet (easier to get started) You can put your own notes in or find sets others have made. Some cool note-taking programs like Notion or Obsidian can also help with this.

*And if you're trying to get organized with all your studying, or pretty much any goal you have, TaskCoach.AI is an AI-powered tool that can give you personalized help to achieve what you set your mind to.*

---
**Get Your Body & Space Right:**

1. Standing Desks: If you can, try a standing desk or one of those things that lifts your laptop up. Switching between sitting and standing can wake you up and help you focus. Don't stand all day, just mix it up.

2. Box Breathing: Feeling stressed or can't focus? Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold for 4. Do this a few times. It actually calms your nerves.

3. Stretch Breaks: Every so often, do some simple stretches, roll your neck, shrug your shoulders, twist your body. Sitting for ages makes you stiff.

4. Water, Water, Water: Your brain needs water to work! If you're dehydrated, you'll feel tired and foggy. Keep a bottle with you and sip on it.

5. Sleep is Your Superpower: Aim for 7-9 hours. When you sleep, your brain locks in what you learned. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time, even on weekends (mostly!).

6. Feeling Sluggish? (Brain Fog & What to Do):

- What's Brain Fog? It's when your brain feels cloudy, you can't concentrate, things are fuzzy, and you're forgetful. It makes studying feel impossible.

- Could it Be Something Else? If you're always tired, have brain fog even after good sleep, or your stomach often feels off, it might be worth checking in with a doctor.

● Food Issues? Sometimes certain foods (like gluten or dairy for some people) can make you feel blah, tired, or foggy. You could try things like an elimination diet (where you stop eating certain foods for a bit to see if you feel better) or even a food intolerance test.

● Get Your Blood Levels Checked: A doctor can do blood work to see if you're low on important stuff like iron or certain vitamins, or if something else is making you feel drained.

---
**Your Gut & Your Brain are BFFs:**

1. Eat Real Food: Load up on fruits, veggies, beans, and whole grains. They feed the good bugs in your gut.

2. Try ""Good Bug"" Foods: Things like yogurt (the kind with ""live active cultures""), kefir, sauerkraut, or kimchi have good bacteria (probiotics).

3. Less Junk: Super processed foods, tons of sugar, and artificial sweeteners can mess with your gut.

4. Chill: Stress is bad for your gut (and studying!). Try those breathing exercises, go for a walk, or find a quiet activity you enjoy.

---
**Supplements? (Talk to a Doc FIRST!):**

*Eating healthy food is always #1. But after talking to a doctor or a dietitian, some people find these helpful:*

1. Omega-3s (like in fish oil): Good for brain power.

2. L-Theanine: Found in green tea. People sometimes take it with caffeine (like from coffee or tea) to feel focused but calm.

3. Magnesium: Can help with nerves and sleep for some.

4. Vitamin D: A lot of people are low, and it can affect energy and mood.

5. Probiotics: Again, food first, but a doc might suggest a specific one if your gut needs extra help.",5,1749296290.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: I’m a huge bookworm and could talk about literature all day—whether it’s diving into a classic novel, discovering indie authors, or debating the best fantasy worlds. I love visiting bookstores, record shops, and museums; there’s something magical about soaking in stories, history, and culture. I’m not much into TV or movies, but I’m all about real-life experiences like day trips to explore nature—think hiking through Scotland’s stunning trails or wandering historic sites. For me, these moments are best when shared with others, as good company makes everything better.

I work a part-time job as a hobby to keep busy, as I’m disabled, but it doesn’t define me. I’m a supportive friend who loves daily check-ins, cheering people on, and building connections that matter. I’ve been told I’m the kind of guy who makes you wonder, “Is he too nice? Is he secretly gay?”—haha, nope, just a genuinely respectful dude who values kindness and authenticity. I’ve ghosted a few folks in the past (haven’t we all?), but I’m here for real, lasting friendships.

Life hasn’t been easy—I’m an orphan, so I don’t have family, which is why I pour so much into my friendships. I’ve been through a lot, including 16 near-death experiences (yep, really!), but I’m healthy now and that’s shifted my perspective. I’ve learned that life isn’t about chasing money or status—I’ve been there, done that, and it didn’t bring happiness. What matters to me is connection, shared experiences, and appreciating the little things, like a good book or a crisp day in nature.

If you’re into books, museums, nature, or just want a friend who’s there for the highs and lows, hit me up! I’d love to chat, maybe meet for a coffee or a wander through a bookstore, or even plan a group day trip. Let’s make some memories and build something real. 😊 Drop a comment or DM me—tell me about you, what you love, or your favorite book!

I'm looking for some good ground coffee around the Colombo area preferably something fresh and locally roasted if possible. Do you know about any good cafes, stores, or roasters that sell quality ground coffee?

## What is Spenoctex App?

Spenoctex App is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of trading digital assets like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and even traditional markets like **stocks** and **forex**. The idea is to take the guesswork out of trading by using AI-powered algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades based on real-time data.

Think of it as your digital trading assistant—it watches the market 24/7, looking for opportunities, and then places trades on your behalf. You can customize risk levels, set trading parameters, or just let the algorithm do its thing. It’s especially useful for people who don’t have the time or expertise to monitor charts all day.

## Who Created Spenoctex App?

The creators of Spenoctex App are a bit under the radar, which is common in this space. Much like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, the team behind it prefers to stay anonymous. What we do know is that the platform partners with **regulated brokers** and has a development team with a background in finance and AI-driven tech.

While the lack of public-facing founders might raise some eyebrows, it’s not necessarily a red flag. A lot of legit platforms choose to keep their teams private, especially in crypto, where privacy is king. What matters more is how the app performs—and so far, it’s ticking a lot of the right boxes.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Spenoctex App Today](https://t.co/Ld6IsmZssw)
## How Does Spenoctex App Work?

Spenoctex App works by using **predictive algorithms** and **machine learning** to scan the markets for profitable trading opportunities. When it finds one, it automatically executes a trade based on the parameters you set (or the default settings).

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- You sign up and deposit funds.
- The app connects you to a **partner broker**.
- The algorithm scans the market using real-time data.
- Trades are placed automatically on your behalf.
- You monitor performance and adjust settings as needed.

You can choose between **manual** and **automated** trading modes, which makes it super flexible. If you're a beginner, you might want to stick with auto-mode. But if you know your way around charts, manual mode gives you more control.

## Spenoctex App Pros and Cons

Like any platform, Spenoctex isn’t perfect. Here’s a quick rundown of the pros and cons I experienced:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to set up and use, even for beginners
- ✅ Offers demo trading mode
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ 24/7 customer support
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (within 24-48 hours)
- ✅ Compatible with mobile devices

**Cons:**
- ❌ $250 minimum deposit might be steep for some
- ❌ No clear info on company founders
- ❌ Not available in all countries
- ❌ Algorithm performance may vary depending on market volatility

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Spenoctex App?

One of the best parts about Spenoctex App is that you’re not tied to a desktop. It’s **web-based**, which means you can access it from:

- **Desktops** (Windows/Mac)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (both iOS and Android)

There’s no need to download anything. Just log in through your browser and you’re good to go. The mobile version is slick and responsive, so you can check your trades while waiting in line for coffee.

## Spenoctex App – Supported Countries

Spenoctex App is available in **most countries**, though there are some exceptions due to regional regulations. Users in the **USA**, **Canada**, **UK**, **Australia**, and most of **Europe** can access the platform without issues.

However, if you’re in a country with strict financial laws (like North Korea, Iran, or parts of Africa), you may not be able to register. Always check the platform’s terms before signing up.

## Spenoctex App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The app’s AI engine pulls in **real-time data** from multiple markets and news sources. This helps it **predict price movements** and place trades that (in theory) have a higher chance of success. It updates constantly, so you’re not relying on outdated info.

### User-Friendly Interface

This was a big win for me. The dashboard is clean and intuitive, with everything clearly labeled. Whether you’re checking your portfolio, tweaking your risk settings, or just watching the bot go to work, everything’s a click away.

### Mobile Accessibility

As mentioned earlier, the app works flawlessly on mobile. You can place trades, withdraw funds, or just keep an eye on things while you’re on the go. No clunky apps, no lag.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom alerts** for things like price changes, trade executions, or profit targets. This makes it easier to stay in the loop without constantly staring at your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Crypto isn’t the only game here. You can also trade **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**. This makes Spenoctex App more versatile than most crypto-only platforms.

## Is Spenoctex App a Scam?

Nope, doesn’t seem like it. I know the trading world is full of sketchy platforms, but Spenoctex App shows real signs of **legitimacy**:

- Partners with **regulated brokers**
- Offers **transparent terms**
- Provides 24/7 **customer support**
- Users have reported **consistent withdrawals**

That said, no trading platform is risk-free. The market is volatile, and even the best AI can’t predict every move. Always invest what you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Spenoctex App?

To get started, you’ll need to deposit at least **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category, but it’s still something to consider if you’re on a tight budget.

You can use **credit cards**, **debit cards**, **bank transfers**, and sometimes even **crypto**, depending on your location.

### Spenoctex App Customer Support

Customer service is available **24/7**, and I actually tested it out. The live chat reps were quick (under 2 minutes) and helpful. You can also reach out via:

- **Email**
- **Contact form**
- **Phone** (varies by broker)

No frustrating bot loops—actual humans reply, which is rare these days.

## How do you start trading on Spenoctex App?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Spenoctex App site and complete the registration form. It’s quick—just name, email, and phone number. No long KYC process upfront.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you’re in, you’ll need to fund the account with at least $250. Verification is usually handled by the broker you’re paired with. It takes a few minutes to a few hours, depending on your country.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can access the dashboard and choose between demo or live mode. I recommend trying demo mode first to get a feel for how the bot behaves. Once you're ready, flip the switch to live trading and let it go.

## How to Delete a Spenoctex App Account?

If you ever want out, deleting your account is easy. Just:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Click **“Delete Account”**.
3. Confirm via email.

Alternatively, you can contact customer support and request account deletion. They usually respond within 24 hours.

If you’re looking for a way to **automate your trades**, stay informed with real-time market data, and manage everything from your phone, this app is worth checking out. Just remember: trading always carries risk. But with the right tools, you can stack the odds a bit more in your favor.

As I mentioned, it's definitely off-meta and not targeted at a very large audience. But my experience with the readers shows that the readership of this stuff can be very devoted and engaged. Still, I'm yet to see how it transfers into the Amazon experience.

I don't plan to stub until I'm well into Book 3 (the three-book arc will cover the first year at the villainy school). But I'm probably going to put Book 1 on Kindle anyway. Just without Kindle Unlimited.

Obviously, this all is still very experimental to me. A year ago, I didn't know a thing about writing fantasy novels. I read a lot since my childhood, but that's obviously not the same. A few months ago, I knew nothing about selling your books. Now, I've already started earning some coffee money from my pen name and plan to add more to that new income stream with the books under my real name.

Patreon for Worlds of Ascension and Dark Lady isn't bringing much. With WoA, the backlog wasn't enough to bring patrons, and I started promoting it too late. With Dark Lady, I never had any backlog -- it's just how the project was envisioned. Most of the money I get there comes from people who support the Genre RS Checker and Book Comparison Tool -- I give them access to a dedicated server that works a bit faster in exchange for their pledges.

I have much more success with my pen name's Patreon. But even there, while I have a few hundred free subscribers, I only have a couple of dozen paid patrons. This month, I'm earning more from KU than from Patreon.

What would I do differently? Well, I'd start writing a book with more experience in writing. That's what I would do. But that's not possible, right? 

With WoA, I'd spend more time trying to figure out where the real beginning of the story is. I should have reworked the first chapters as soon as I saw that 25% retention rate. But I slacked and lost a lot of potential followers.

With Dark Lady, I've lost a lot of momentum by posting only one chapter per week and not having any backlog. I've got on the genre Rising Stars list (my first one was Gender Bender) in my fifth week and on the main Rising Stars list in my seventh week. That seems to be a bit too late to rise high on the list. Still, #25 isn't bad. I've posted one chapter per week, starting with the first chapter. I didn't do a 10-chapter drop or whatever. I would never do it this way again.

Well, not the ""once-per-week"" thing. The ""not having a 10-chapter drop on the first day"" thing.

Felix was my latest three-day fling.

I was using him to make Sam jealous, but a drunken night had turned into another night, and suddenly it was Wednesday and I had yet to leave his place.

Fuck.

He was supposed to be someone I could kick to the curb, someone to take out my frustration on. But now, Felix was more than a rebound. Even tangled in his bed, I couldn’t stop thinking about Sam.

Sam Thwaites rejected me at seventeen years old, and then waltzed back into my life. 

As teenagers, I told him I loved him, and Sam got all flustered and started shaking his head like I was something he didn’t believe in.

Sam said things like, “I didn’t know you thought of me this way,” and, “Wait, you liked me?” with this dumb fucking look on his face. He told me he needed space and left me in the pouring rain.

Five years later, he was standing in my parents’ lounge.

I could still smell him on my skin. And I hated it. I hated him.

“Bree!” Mom’s smile was wide. She and Dad were obsessed with finding me a suitor.

“This is Samuel.”

Sam Thwaites took my hand, entwining his fingers with mine. He was so warm, and I hated that I wanted to fall into him. I hated that my heart was pounding through my chest.

I had already seen him, bumping into him in the snow.

I had already shamelessly fucked him in a stall without truly looking at him, angry and frustrated and really, really fucking hot. 

I wanted to tell him that whatever he wanted to happen was over. 

I told him I hated him, curled against him, the two of us out of breath, my head against his chest, his head tipped back, half-lidded eyes skimming the ceiling.

We were sprawled out on ice-cold tiles, his fingers stroking through my hair. I told him to leave.

But there he was, standing in my parents’ house. In the exposed light, Sam looked older. 

Maturer in the face. The baby fat had disappeared, replaced by handsome, more defined features. Thick brown curls hung over playful eyes that wanted a challenge.

The slight curve in his lips told me everything I needed to know. Sam remembered our stupid childhood pact.

I could hear it in his voice, the satisfaction dripping from his tone.

“Hello, Brianna.”

I pulled him outside, straight into the downpour.

“What are you doing here?” I demanded.

Sam shrugged with a smile. “We’re both adults, aren’t we?”

I thought back to our childhood pact. If neither of us had found anyone by the age of twenty, we’d marry each other.

“You left me.”

Sam stepped forward, grasping my hands. “I did,” he admitted. “But I was a stupid kid, Bree. I had no idea what I was talking about, and I was… scared.”

“Scared?”

He nodded, blinking rain out of his eyes.

“I was scared of losing you.”

I laughed incredulously. “You did lose me, Sam. When you left me in the rain.”

“But I’m not scared anymore.” His voice was soft. He got closer, so close I could see his breath.

Sam kissed me tenderly, one hand cupping my cheek, the other sliding up my jacket. His mouth found my ear, something wet and warm oozing down my neck.

“Take… it.” Sam’s voice changed, suddenly different.

“Please.”

Pulling away from the kiss, I shoved him back.

“How much is my father paying you?”

Sam swiped at his… bloody? lips, and a question sprang to mind.

Where did the blood come from?

“Well?” I demanded, my voice collapsing into a sob. “Is my dad paying you or not? Is that why you came back?”

Sam didn’t answer. His face crumpled.

“Bree—”

“Save it.”

I left before he could fully open his mouth.

Halfway down the road, I realized I was freezing cold.

Then a shadow loomed. An umbrella shielded me.

“You look like a drowned rat.”

My colleague was next to me, avoiding my gaze. “Take this.” He turned away, curling his lip. “Do whatever you want with it. I don’t care.” He twisted around, stuffing his hands into his pockets.

The next day at work, I couldn’t stop thinking about Sam.

Felix, the lead singer of a local band and a law student, was the perfect distraction. I met him in a bar.

He was the Aussie trying to maintain a Duolingo streak, downing shots like soda. His accent was cute. It reminded me of water, or maybe that was just my drunken state. The cadence in his voice was like trickling.

I told him this, and he laughed. His suggestive wink took us to his apartment, and we spent the night together after I drunkenly told him I thought he was hot.

I expected it to be a one-time thing, but then we were having sex on his kitchen counter.

I told him it wasn’t serious. But a one-night stand had become more of a three-day, friends-with-benefits thing.

Now, we were sitting outside my work drinking coffee, and I was starting to reconsider my stance on Australian Felix.

There was something about the way he smiled with all his teeth, nervously tapped his coffee cup, and occasionally lost himself mid-conversation. I liked it.

I liked watching his mind jet off into space. His longing gaze was adorable.

Felix was sitting awkwardly, chin resting on his fist, talking about his favourite band. I was enraptured by caramel-colored eyes and the dimples in his cheeks.

The sun was shining, and we were sitting under cherry blossoms I didn’t remember seeing before. I was supposed to be working, and he had come to see me, armed with cupcakes and my favourite coffee.

Dreamer Felix.
Dimpled-cheeks Felix.

Felix with the trickling accent and slight lisp, who stumbled over his words and had a milk moustache I desperately wanted to wipe away. I did, leaning over the table and lightly brushing my finger across his upper lip.

“You’ve got a little…”

Felix’s eyes widened. He swiped at his mouth, chuckling. “Ah. That’s… kinda embarrassing.”

A loud and overly exaggerated throat-clear made me jump.

“Urgh. I think I just threw up in my mouth.”

Looming over me like a bad smell was my colleague, Jasper, scowling as usual.

Standing with his arms crossed over his apron, he shot me a patronizing smile, completely blanking Felix.

The boy dumped my latte down, spilling half of it across the table.

Behind him, a group of teenage girls were giggling. I wasn’t surprised.

Jasper really could pull off any look, and just like the girls squealing over him, I couldn’t resist handsome features and a killer jawline. It just sucked that he was one of the rudest people I had ever met.

He was wearing the same shirt from yesterday, his apron flung over the top, cropped blonde hair in disarray. Running a hand through it, he groaned.

“You’re supposed to be working, Bree,” he said in a sing-song voice. Leaning across the table, Jasper’s patronizing smile widened. “Are we done here?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Sorry, Jasper.”

“You should be.” Jasper’s gaze flicked to Felix. “You’re a student, right?”

“Uh…” Felix nodded slowly. “Yeah? I guess.”

My colleague shot him a sparkly grin. “Five percent off at the Crap ‘N Shack this weekend. Student discount. Alcohol served after 9pm will be free.”

“Woah, really?” Felix downed the rest of his drink, eyes wide.

I glanced at his cup. I could have sworn he’d already finished it.

“What about parking?” Felix asked. “Will… I still get a ticket?”

“Nope.” Jasper gave him a grin and a thumbs-up. 

“Make sure to bring a student ID, and parking is free. It’s all going down at the Crap ‘N Shack this Saturday, with a special guest, local music artist Tiema Wright, performing his new song, ‘I’m Sorry I Left You in the Rain, but Will You Marry Me?’”

Both boys turned to me with matching smiles, speaking in sync.

“Will you be there, Brianna?”

I nodded, grinning. “You bet I will.” I saluted Felix with my drink. “Shouldn’t you be heading to class?”

“I love you, Jasper!” one of the girls squeaked behind me.

My colleague rolled his eyes, not even turning around to look at her.

“I know you do,” Jasper sighed, pulling out his notepad and pen.

He sidestepped to the next table, serving the people next to us. He licked his finger with exaggerated slowness and flipped the page. “But you're embarrassing yourself, sweetheart.”

“I’m free after work,” I said. “Maybe you could come back to my place?”

“You're on the late shift tonight with me, so no, you're not free,” Jasper said behind me. When I twisted around to shoot him a look, he was tapping his pen on his notepad, mid-eyeroll.

“No, sir, we don't do refills. Nope, I can't make an exception, and no, complaining about it will just make me laugh.”

“I'll text you,” I told Felix.

“Sounds good.” He jumped up, finishing his coffee and grabbing his backpack. The Pikachu keyring on his zipper made me smile. “I have class, but I'll reply when I'm out, all right?”

Felix lifted his hand in a wave, took two steps back, and was crushed by a falling sheet of glass.

I'm not sure when it was that my mind stirred and I regained consciousness for the fraction of a second. It was enough for my vision to clear, my senses coming back to the surface.

The never-ending script of words programmed into my brain stopped abruptly, and I was left suffocating on my own breaths.

I was awake.

Awake, blinking at Felix’s body being peeled from concrete.

Awake.

Awake enough to notice my colleague visibly flinched behind his notepad when Felix died. Awake enough to be able to breathe again, to coerce words in my mind.

I had zero idea who I was before Brianna Timberman. Who was underneath flawless skin and manicures and sparkling teeth? My senses returned in waves. Taste.

I had drunk the same coffee four times, and I could taste coffee grounds on my tongue.

Smell.

There were sweat patches staining my blouse.

Touch.

I could feel my coffee cup, running my finger around the rim.

I am not Brianna Timberman.

The thought slammed into me, and I felt my hands twitch by my sides, the overwhelming urge to tear off my skin, layer after layer until I found myself.

When did I regain my free will?

Maybe it was when Felix’s blood was seeping across my shoes, his body an unrecognizable mess of stringy flesh and lumps under splinters of glass sparkling like diamonds across the sidewalk.

It took me half a second to realize a woman was screaming in my face.

“Oh my god, sweetie, are you okay?”

Autopilot.

I nodded shakily, words already tumbling out of my mouth.

“I'm fine.”

“Was he your boyfriend?”

Autopilot.

“No.”

For some reason, my eyes found Jasper still hiding behind his notebook.

“He wasn’t.”

No matter how hard I tried to fight it, Brianna’s feelings were already swamping me. 

I felt my cheeks heat up, my stomach fluttering. 

Before autopilot thoughts could spring out of nowhere, I remembered my colleague’s reaction to Felix’s death, as well as him subtly trying to stop me from talking to Sam.

There was zero doubt in my mind that Jasper knew what was going on.

If the rest of us were recycled lumps of skin, what was he? He was a love interest, but he wasn’t one of Bree’s exes.

Sam explained my colleague was a curveball.

The so-called bad boy playing with Brianna Timberman’s feelings.

With little to no thoughts of my own, I stated the facts in my head.

My life wasn't real. I was nothing but recycled flesh sculpted and molded into a dead prom queen with her memories. That thought still had not sunk in yet, and when I started to register it, all I wanted to do was peel my skin from my bones until I found myself.

Who I was, hiding under patchwork flesh.

So many Briannas stitched onto me. So many lost souls.

I had been on autopilot for days. All that I had left when I came to was a vague memory of every other death.

Ben, Alex, and Esme.

Car crash. 

Carbon monoxide poisoning.

Now Felix.

Crushed to death.

Each of their deaths had been voted on by the townspeople.

It was only a matter of time before Felix would be erased from existence too.

Sam, or the boy underneath him, had shown me who I really was, a lump of flesh sculpted into Brianna Timberman.

Sam had the same fate.

He showed me where he came from, a factory that had turned the town’s teen populace into the exact same four faces.

Brianna Timberman’s exes.

Ben, Alex, Esme, and Sam.

First, he was an Alex, then a Ben, and then an extra who tried to warn me, before being abruptly converted into Sam Thwaites, a brand new love interest and Brianna’s childhood friend.

Sam told me Brianna’s exes’ deaths were a joke, her love life controlled by the town through a popularity poll.

Brianna had died years ago, but the town was obsessed.

They wanted to watch her life. They wanted to see which person she would choose, voting for their favorites while dooming the loser to a fate worse than death. 

The least popular love interest would die brutally, and the cycle would continue. In this case, it was Felix.

The boy suppressed under Sam had shown me the truth, only to be captured and turned into one of my parent’s suitors. 

The realization was like a kick in the face. I was alone. Awake and aware of too-bright lights on my face, and unable to cry out or scream.

Brianna Timberman was dead, but according to the town, the show must go on.

Staying very still, I was suddenly well aware of patrons on their phones.

I glanced at a teenage girl, who was rapidly swiping right on an image of my colleague, while a man holding a briefcase lazily swiped left on Sam.

“Your boyfriend should have been more careful.”

I blinked.

Jasper was in front of me, arms folded across his apron.

Sam talked about a Red Zone in the bathroom stalls a few days ago.

He said it was where they couldn’t see us, and I would be fully conscious, severed from whatever was in my head.

Jasper waved his hand in front of my face, and it suddenly occurred to me that if I wanted answers, such as where the Red Zone was located, I needed my colleague’s help.

Brianna Timberman was in full control of my mind, so regaining free will was getting progressively harder.

Two days later, after being stuck on autopilot, I was serving a woman trying to calm her screaming kid.

Felix didn’t have a funeral, and his name was already forgotten. In my half-awake state, though, I remembered him.

I had since met two people.

Adrianna, who was a quick make-out in a bathroom stall.

She smelled just like Esme — roses and cheap perfume.

Ren. The older college professor who I drunkenly kissed in the back of an Uber.

I can’t pinpoint the times when I was fully awake.

Fully in control.

I was perfecting a foam heart on a customer’s latte when I realized I really wanted to fuck my colleague. 

The thought was explosive, immediately setting my cheeks on fire. Trying to suppress it was a losing battle.

“Hey.” Jasper sidled in front of me, tearing me out of my thoughts — or Brianna’s thoughts. I had spent the last hour dazedly staring at his wonderfully sculpted jawline, unable to look at anything else.

Brianna liked to fantasize, and her mind wasn’t exactly PG-13.

It’s not like I had control of my mouth. Autopilot meant my body and mind worked for me. I was just lucky to be conscious — or at least semi-conscious.

I had a semblance of a plan, and the first part was finding Sam Thwaites. 

Or the boy sculpted into Sam. The last time I saw him before going on autopilot, I had no idea if he was awake or just a really good fucking performer.

The Red Zone was all I could think of.

If I wanted out of this nightmare, I needed to find it.

However, thinking was kind of hard when all I could think about was my colleague’s biceps.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the way he swung a carton of milk mid-conversation with our manager.

Jasper caught my eye, scowling.

“Bree. Get your fucking head out of the clouds.”

My colleague’s tone was so shamelessly unapologetic, a group of girls in the queue burst into giggles. The guy was like a circus attraction.

Now that I had a semblance of actual thought, I realized our only customers were women, with the odd man every blue moon. Jasper cleared his throat and set the milk down.

“Okay, look, I’m sorry your boyfriend got flattened or whatever, but you need to stop moping around like someone freakin’ died.”

Autopilot.

There was a bright light suddenly.

I shoved him. Hard.

“Why do you always have to be such a dick?”

Jasper was unfazed. He didn’t even stumble. I felt it — a shiver creeping down my spine, an insatiable need clouding my thoughts.

Brianna Timberman was hot. Very hot. Jasper’s attitude, his movement, everything about him and being so close to him was making her flustered.

She was sweating under her apron, and all she could look at, all she could focus on, was her colleague — who was, against all odds, still playing hard to get.

All around us, patrons went silent.

The girls in the queue started nudging each other. My colleague stepped forward, his breath tickling my face.

He was a little too close. “I should be asking you the same thing,” he murmured, lips twitching into a smirk.

“You’ve been staring at me all morning.” Jasper stepped closer, backing me into the counter. I could feel my cheeks getting hotter and hotter, my thoughts clouding.

Another step, and we were nose to nose.

Jasper cocked his head. “Do I… have something on my face, Bree?”

It took every morsel of self-control to turn away from him, back to the queue.

I smiled widely at the customer, making lattes and coffees. But my stomach was dancing, my mind foggy and distant.

It didn’t help that every time Jasper shoved past me, he made it intentional, and the friction of his body against mine, his hands brushing my waist, was driving me crazy. 

Sam mentioned aphrodisiacs being pumped through the vent in the bathroom stalls to influence intimacy between Brianna and her love interests.

I had a feeling that was what was happening. Still, though, when I peeked at the ceiling, I couldn’t see a vent.

I couldn’t stop my own wandering hands every time he passed me.

It was a game, in a way.

Who would crack first.

I was in the break room trying to cool myself off when Jasper stepped in front of me.

“Vegan milk,” he said. Despite acting cool and collected, maintaining his asshole smirk, I glimpsed a noticeable red blush spreading across his cheeks.

His lips found my ear. “Can you… help me find it?”

Autopilot.

Autopilot had taken us into the dark. My body and emotions and feelings were no longer mine, choking, drowning in fog that contorted me into exactly what these people wanted.

I’m not sure how I got from the break room to the storage closet, pinned against a shelf, half-naked, my legs wrapped around my colleague. 

He started, of course, with his mouth latched to my ear, muttering about Mulberry Milk offers, before his lips found mine.

His breath was heavy, his hands finding my waist and sliding up my shirt.

God, I pretended a lot of things weren’t happening for the sake of not losing my fucking mind.

I pretended I couldn’t hear the wolf whistles and squeals rumbling in the walls surrounding us, that the pleasure riding through me was mine, and not theirs. We had an audience.

Somehow, that was even worse than my body being used to satisfy others.

I pretended I wasn’t fully exposed, and even worse, that I wanted it.

I wanted to get closer to him, pressing my mouth into his clammy neck and burying my face in his shoulder.

I wanted him to continue, his lips in my hair.

Tipping my head back, my vision was blurring.

But I could see it.

Right above our heads, there was the vent pumping us full of aphrodisiacs.

I laughed, and it was so out of character Jasper pulled away for a moment, brows knotting in confusion.

“The Red Zone,” I managed to grit out through Brianna Timberman’s mouth. “Where is it?”

When he didn’t respond, I grabbed the back of his head, forcing him to look at me. 

Under the dim light of a flickering bulb, my colleague’s eyes were half-lidded, his pupils dilated pools of confusing black. I had no doubt he hadn’t been heavily drugged.

Jasper kissed me deeply again, and when I managed to shove him away, he tightened his grip on my waist, pressing his face into my shoulder.

“The Red Zone,” I repeated, my thoughts reduced to soup.

I only had a certain amount of time, and that time was running out.

I shoved him again. This time, I felt filthy.

His clammy hands all over my skin were like poison.

I felt suffocated every time he leaned in.

The worst part was that this man had zero choice either.

The thought struck, sending violent tremors through me.

How many times had my corpse of a body been used like this?

How many times had I been fucked, or fucked someone else, for this town’s sickening obsession with Brianna Timberman?

“Tell me where it is!” I said through a shriek.

Jasper slowly started to respond, blinking rapidly. “The… wha?”

He was a good performer, awake or not.

“You knew what was going on when your friends dragged Sam away.”

I kept my voice low, kissing him harder to keep the narrative going. Especially when I could hear the dull sound of pounding feet. These freaks wanted us to fuck.

I made sure to let my mouth linger on his, aware of every inch of the two of us being watched, analyzed, probably photographed and posted to the town website. 

“I saw you flinch when Felix died. Which means you were awake.”

I pulled away slowly, playing with the collar of his shirt. 

But at the same time, I was looking for every possible escape route. Sam was right. To my left, I could see a subtle red light dancing across Jasper’s jaw.

And to my right, another skimming across my neck.

So, I grabbed the boy, shoving him against the shelf, switching our positions.

“You tracked me down that day,” I spoke softly, pretending to bury my head in his chest. 

“You knew exactly where I was. And you took Sam away. So, you know exactly where the Red Zone is. You know where he was hiding.”

Jasper surprised me with a chuckle. When I lifted my gaze, my vision was fuzzy, my body hot and flustered, and yet I was shivering. 

His head was tipped back, lazy eyes tracking the ceiling. He was following the exact same red light.

“You’re a funny girl, Bree,” he murmured. 

My colleague leaned forward, keeping up the façade for our unseen audience. He was doing exactly what they wanted, the curve of his back almost too perfectly lit up.

It was exactly what Brianna Timberman had fantasized.

Jasper’s panting breaths found my ear. “Keep talking, though? You’re going to fuck both of us over.”

His words sent shivers trickling down my spine.

In the corner of my eye, the red light was visible. If the room was too dark, that meant they were tracking and filming our movements. I didn’t think.

Grabbing my colleague’s shoulders, I yanked him to his knees, dropping with him. Risking a glance behind us, the light was gone. Which meant (or at least I hoped) that we were out of shot.

Jasper regarded me lazily, inclining his head. “What are you–”

I slammed my hand over his mouth, cutting him off.

“The Red Zone. You know exactly where it is.” I hissed, tightening my grip on his shoulder. When he played stupid, I dug my fingernails in. “You’re not an ex,” I said, “So, what are you?”

“Jasper?” my colleague muffled under my hand, pointing to his name tag. 

When I removed my hand, his lips spread into a grin. But I caught his eyes frantically searching for those red lights.

“I have no idea what you're talking about, Bree!” He raised his voice significantly. “But… did you know vegan milk is made with only the best pasteurized milk from Mulberry Farms?”

This guy wasn't going to sing, so I had to get creative.

Above us, three red lights were scanning the dark.

They were looking for us.

“Please,” I whispered, searching his eyes for a hint of a human being.

“You're as much of a victim as me, right? Don't you want out of here?!”

Jasper responded with his signature eye roll, maintaining that plastic fucking grin.

“I… have zero idea what you’re talking about! But do you know what I really want to talk about? Mulberry Farms milk!”

I couldn't stop myself. Maybe it was frustration, desperation, or a mix of both. 

I wasn't fully thinking straight when I grasped the back of his head and slammed Jasper’s skull into the metal edge of the shelf. 

I regretted it immediately when the guy’s eyes rolled to the pearly whites, his body going limp in my arms, head lolling onto his shoulder.

When a single rivulet of red slid from his nose, I realized he was like Sam.

Sam, who must have given himself a head injury to wake himself up.

A severing.

Under the influence of the narrative, as well as aphrodisiacs choking my thoughts into arousal, I never really saw my colleague’s body. I only saw what Brianna wanted to see: lean muscles and a perfectly sculpted V-line.

But now, away from the cameras, and in the fading light of a dying bulb, I saw them, running my trembling fingers over rugged, stitched, and patchwork skin molding this boy, and so many others, into the perfect man.

I could see where parts of him had been replaced and cut away, his entire face airbrushed into a viewer’s fantasy.

But looking closer, his real eyes were mismatched contortions of blue and brown.

I waited for the sarcastic eye roll and immediate plug-in advertisement.

Instead, though, the man's expression was softer.

He looked dazed, confused, blinking rapidly.

But, as he slowly drank in his surroundings, his expression started to twist into fear, pain, and anger.

Anger that was so vast, so overwhelming, that he dropped to his knees, scrubbing at his face. I didn't know what to say. 

Sorry didn't mean anything. 

Sam was gentle when he told me I was recycled skin, nothing but a flesh puppet for a psychotic town.

But I didn't give him a chance to take it in. I plunged him directly into this cruel, horrifying reality.

Jasper’s frenzied gaze went to his hands, and then his hands were in his hair, clawing down his face.

His lips parted like he was going to speak, but I don't think he could.

Jasper’s eyes filled with frustrated tears. Terror that was something I could relate to, an existential dread and confusion and pain that was tearing him apart. I knew the questions at the back of his mind:

Why me? Why was this happening to me? How can I be alive? How can I be real when the rest of me is nothing?

I felt my own fingers trace the scars across my stomach.

Scars that only I could feel, deeply indented into my skin.

Skin that I wanted to rip into, to tear away.

Because… I was somewhere, right?

Underneath all of this, my old self was there.

I fucking had to be, because I can't just be this.

Jasper stumbled back, clumsy on his feet, embarrassed and confused, trying to hide himself. When blood started seeping freely from his nose and down his chin, I found my voice.

“Hey.”

I spoke softly, and his eyes finally found mine, resembling a startled deer.

“Can you tell me who you are?”

I swallowed thick slime creeping into my mouth.

“Who you were?”

For a sobering moment, it was just the two of us.

Not Brianna and Jasper.

His eyes found mine, truly drinking me in.

And something sparked in his expression: recognition or familiarity.

His hands cupped my face, fingers running down my cheeks.

The man was mute, speechless, and yet somehow, he was crying.

Crying for me.

A stranger.

Somehow, though, my hands, or at least part of my hand, the stitched and rugged parts of me, responded to his touch.

“Bree? Jasper?”

When the door flew open, I jumped to my feet, pulling the boy with me.

They were paranoid, I thought, mirroring Sam’s earlier words.

The town was making sure we were still satisfying them.

To my surprise, Jasper’s eyes dilated back to brown.

“Uh,” his voice was choked up, more of a growl, “Give us a sec, all right?”

Autopilot.

I bent down and grabbed my shirt, throwing it on.

Jasper buttoned up his own, brushing himself down.

He stepped back, winking.

“Same time tomorrow?”

Autopilot.

Brianna didn't speak. Instead, she headed towards the door. 

She wanted him to chase after her for more.

But not before Jasper came close, hissing in my ear.

“You want to go on a death mission? Fine.” I was already pulling away, or Brianna was pulling away, because my body was being forced forward.

Still, he held me, tightening his grip. “The thrift store across the street. Stall three, in the bathroom,” he said. “Just, please,” Jasper’s tone softened, “please never fucking do that to me again.”

So, I had a location.

The problem was actually getting to it.

Autopilot.

It was stronger, forcing me onto the stage.

I spilled coffee over a customer, and of course, Jasper came to the rescue.

When I dropped a tray full of drinks, slipping on someone's mess, his arms were already wrapped around me, catching me before I could hit the ground.

When our eyes met, Brianna Timberman’s heart fluttered.

The people surrounding us were already swiping right on their phones.

Jasper helped me stand up. “You should be more careful, you idiot,” he grumbled.

I nodded, straightening up.

Jasper leaned against the refrigerator. “Do you know Sam Thwaites?”

I didn't look up from making coffee. “Yeah. He was…”

I blinked away memories of the two of us as kids.

“Just a friend.”

“He’s bad news,” Jasper said. “The guy is working for your dad.”

“That’s not… that’s not true.”

“Oh, really?” He stepped in front of me, head tilted to the side. “So he just came back into your life for no reason?”

“I don’t want to talk about Sam.”

“But… did he leave you anything?” Jasper murmured. “Like a… I don’t know, a parting gift, maybe?”

Before I could reply, my colleague blurted, “What were you wearing when we were…” He looked around nervously. “Looking for vegan milk?”

“I… don’t know?” I prodded at my apron. “This, I guess? Why?”

“Oh, no reason!” He winked at me. “Did you know my aunt died recently?”

“No…”

“Well, her funeral was all sorted within a matter of days,” Jasper continued, speaking through that same grin. 

“Callister Funeral Care really did give me the comfort me and my family needed while we were in mourning…”

Autopilot.

I woke up halfway through my shift the next day, in the middle of serving three boys.

Immediately, I dropped what I was doing, darting to the door.

“I’m going on my break!” I yelled, grabbing my jacket and pushing through a group of girls. 

The town thrift store was empty. I was pushing through the door when a girl shoved past me, hard enough to knock my jacket from my hands. When I scooped it up, something dropped from my pocket.

Inside was a single black, disk-shaped thing. I shoved the plastic down my bra.

“Bree? What are you doing here?”

Lifting my head, my colleague was standing over me.

Jasper’s smile was a little too big.

When he helped me up, his voice was a sharp breath. “How exactly are you planning on getting in the men’s bathroom, genius?”

I had a way.

But neither of us were going to like it.

Autopilot, however, did my job for me. I was in a bathroom stall on my knees when reality hit, and I shook my head clear of the fog. 

Jasper was already pulling me to my feet. 

Pressing a finger to his lips and motioning for me to be quiet, he pointed above our heads. Instead of a window, there was a hatch. “Red Zone Two,” he mouthed. “Fucking go.”

I nodded, climbing onto the toilet bowl and throwing myself through the hatch.

This time, I fell directly into a pile of still-wet and still-warm bodies.

But these weren’t Alex’s or Ben’s or Sam’s.

My own face, my perfectly molded and sculpted Barbie-doll face, stared back at me. 

Brianna Timberman was everywhere. Her glazed blue eyes and wide smile were suffocating me. 

When I stood up, I started to see patches. I saw skin and hair, torn and stained clothes with body parts still attached. Different faces.

Girls.

Beautiful girls with their heads severed, their bodies reduced to mutilated flesh.

Smiles stretched into skeletal grimaces. Eyes scooped from sockets.

As if I felt some connection with the doll pieces around me, I started to claw at my legs.

Like I could find my own skin. Revel in it.

I stood up at the sound of a mechanical whirring. In front of me was a bloodstained conveyor belt that wasn’t moving. It was frozen, just like the room with Sam’s, Ben’s, Alex’s, and Esme’s.

I felt my fingernails rip into my arms and my face. My gaze was glued to the cut-offs, the human bodies scattering the metal flooring. Is this what I was?

I ripped into the skin of my face until I felt the sting.

But there was no blood. Nothing to remind me I was human.

“Bree. You need to get out of here. Now.”

I was barely aware Jasper had joined me. He picked up my jacket.

“Who are you?” I asked him, my voice shuddering.

“Wrong.”

His response surprised me. “Which is why they’re going to kill me off soon, and I’ll die the way I was supposed to.” His eyes found mine, tragic, suddenly. “Just like him.”

Jasper’s words collapsed into white noise.

Instead, I was someplace else, a memory splintering into dozens of memories.

I was… Clara.

Jamie.

Lily.

Kiera.

Becca.

Elizabeth. 

I was running. 

Screaming. 

There was a horde of us; young men and women. The girls dressed in pink, the guys dressed in blue. A guy was in front of me, pulling at my hand. 

His dirt splattered blue tee clung to a string bean frame, a pair of glasses stuffed in his fist. 

The first thing I noticed was his flawed face. Beautiful, but imperfect. Thick dark curls, freckles, a scar cutting through his left eye. *“The far gate is the exit!”* The voice in front was female. 

She held out her hand, and I glimpsed long dark hair flying behind her. Wide eyes.

Esme. 

“If we reach it, we’ll get out of here. Just *keep* running,” she gasped out, grabbing me and tugging me into a stumbled sprint. 

I followed her, bathed in a thick deluge of blue and pink slamming straight into a tall, wired fence. 

Ahead of me, the girl with Esme’s features dropped to the ground— and I screamed, my cry raw and choked. It was my voice. My real voice. 

Gunshots filled the air, cracking in my ears as swathes of blue and pink began dropping like flies. 

I hit the ground on my stomach, winded, heaving out breaths.

I was dazed, panting, staring at a cloudless sky, before heavy footsteps thudded over. I felt cold metal prick the back of my neck, heard the click, and—

A sharp flash, and I was standing stiff. Upright. 

I was moving, a long line of girls in front of me. 

I *felt* them, writhing, entangled around my bones. 

Every girl I was made out of. 

The cruel needle plunging into the back of her neck, instantly killing her. 

A second needle injecting a solution that kept the *body* alive.

Her thoughts and feelings and sensations.

All of it was kept alive. 

Conscious. 

The whirring blades coming down and skinning away her face, her eyes, her lips, her screams falling on deaf ears. 

Her sculpted body, naked and raw, was shoved forwards. 

The next metal arms made sure to stitch up loose skin, adding and removing and slicing away what was no longer needed, adding a metal exoskeleton to assure no damage. 

Then came clothes, a yellow summer dress, exactly what she was wearing on the day Sam Thwaites dumped her in the rain. The final metal arm was more of a brush, a thing scraping across the face to make sure Brianna was *perfect*. 

When she tumbled off of the conveyor belt, smiling widely, I wasn't Clara, or Jamie, or Lily… 

Fuck.

I *was* Brianna Timberman. 

Standing at the end of the line, with his arms folded, was Brianna’s father. 

His smile was proud, eyes glinting with madness. 

He stroked my face, eyes filling with tears. 

“*She's perfect.*”

The memory shattered, coming apart, when something pricked my neck. There was a blinding white light on me. 

“We’ve got her, sir.” 

A muffled cry, and I could *just* see Jasper being wrenched back. 

“Hey! I did what you told me to do! The pocket is empty!” his voice deepened into a growl. “Let me go!”

The figure who grabbed him seemed to enjoy his discomfort. She had wandering hands.  “Five more seasons, pretty boy.” The woman hummed. 

“Brianna may have forgiven you, but your debt is with Mr Timberman.”

“Wait! No, we had a fucking deal you piece of– *mmppphmmh*!”

I was forced onto my stomach. “AND the love interest who appears to be faulty. It's the tracer who was supposed to be following her.” The voice swam in and out, as my mind plunged. 

*“Yes. I'll get him remodelled immediately. Uh-huh. Brianna is A-okay, sir. Do you have my permission to proceed?”*

**Autopilot**.

This time it was deep, dragging me to impossible depths. 

“Brianna!” 

Mom’s voice snapped me back to half-fruition. 

I was standing in my parent’s hallway in front of Sam. 

Sam, who had lowered himself to one knee, a ring pinched between his fingers.

“Say yes!” Mom stood behind me, standing with my brother. 

Will. 

Wait, no, they changed his name to Harry. 

*Autopilot.*

My lips spread into a smile. 

Two bright lights on the two of us. 

“Yes.” I whispered, when he wrapped his arms around me. “I'll marry you.”

The walls around us were ooh-ing and ahh-ing. 

When the lights switched off, and Sam’s smile stayed plastic and taut, I realized the boy underneath was *gone*. 

But it was when his head was in my chest, did I remember his earlier words. 

*“Please. Take it.”*

*Autopilot*.

The day skipped forward. 

I was only aware of my mother’s hands tangled in my hair. 

She was dragging me down the hallway. 

“Don't worry Brianna!” She said gleefully, tightening her hold.

“No daughter of mine is this much of a nuisance, and the show *must* go on!”

I was shoved into a room and locked in, on autopilot. 

Jasper and Sam stood inside, also on autopilot. But, after regaining myself, I can break myself out of autopilot. The medic came to see me. According to her, I'm *slightly* severed. They're going to fix me. Like what they did to Sam. 

Then my body and mind will be recycled. I could be a newly refurbished Brianna again, or maybe I'll be an Esme.

But I think I know how to save myself and the others. I just need to find myself. 

I want to cut Brianna Timberman away, and look underneath. 

But I'm terrified that under all of these layers? They're will be nothing left. 

I've already done most of it. Right now, half of my face is caught under my nails. 

But the more I cut away, oh god, peeling away layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after—",2,1749295596.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

Thank you to this community for sharing your study methods, resources and tips. They helped immensely in preparation for my own exam and helped validate that the resources I was using and the way I was studying were leading me towards success. 

Recommendations for those wishing to take the exam in the future:

Make use of ISACA official material like the review manual and QAE. The review manual is a slog but it's the best resource to help you understand the core concepts of wach domain required to pass the exam. The QAE provides much greater value helping you to understand how ISACA will structure their questions and why one answer is better vs another. 

Supplement your studies using other resources like online questions and course. Find what works for you. I used Hemang Doshis CRISC masterclass on Udemy which he updates regularly as needed. It's a good resource closely aligned with the ISACA review manual and QAE. I also used Prabh Nairs CRISC coffee shorts on YouTube. 

Do practice questions. Once you are understanding how ISACA asks questions and  are hitting strong passing grades consistently, book your exam. I was hitting high 90s before I booked my exam but other people staye that you can get away with less. Try aiming between 80 to 100 percent.

Key thing is that you do what works for you when preparing as we all study and retain information differently. One last nugget of wisdom is to check out this community and gauge what others are using to pass the exam and their experience with the exam. It's useful in plotting a road map for success.  

The questions you practice won't be the same as what's on the actual exam but the structure is the same and the exam is fair. If you're doing well in the practice tests in the QAE and in Hemang Doshis course, you're likely ready to take the exam.

Good luck to those taking the exam. Feels good to have this one done and dusted. ",4,1749295515.0,CRISC,1,1.0,False

Hong KongCNN — 

US President Donald Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping has agreed to restart the flow of crucial rare earth materials, after announcing a new round of US-China trade talks will be held in London on Monday.

Trump made the comments a day after holding his long-awaited phone call with Xi, during which the two leaders agreed to [resume negotiations](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/business/china-trade-talks-london) stalled over mutual accusations of violating the truce reached in Geneva last month.

For Washington, a major sticking point has been China’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential for everything from cars to fighter jets, and critical to American industries and defense.

In the weeks since the fragile detente, Washington has accused Beijing of slow-walking approvals for rare earth exports and reneging on its promise made in Geneva, with Trump expressing increasing urgency to speak to his Chinese counterpart to iron things out.

After a 90-minute call on Thursday, Trump said he and Xi had “straightened out” some points related to rare earth magnets, describing it as “very complex stuff.” But he did not specify what exactly had been agreed upon.

Asked Friday if Xi had agreed to restart the flow of rare earth minerals and magnets, Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One: “Yes, he did.” He did not further elaborate on how fast that would happen, or the volume of the materials that would be released.

The Chinese readout of the call did not mention rare earths. Instead, it quoted Xi as saying that China had “seriously and earnestly” complied with the trade truce agreement.

Asked about it at the Chinese foreign ministry’s daily briefing on Friday, a spokesperson sidestepped the question, saying it was a matter for other agencies to address.

China, which controls 90% of the global processing of rare earths, imposed export restrictions on some minerals and magnets on April 4 at the height of the tariff war, after Trump slapped “reciprocal” levies on Chinese goods. The new system does not ban exports outright, but requires government approval for each shipment.

Chinese scholars who advise the government suggested on Thursday that Beijing is not ready to give up the powerful leverage bestowed by its dominance on the rare earth supply chain – and may seek to use it to get Washington to ease its own export controls aimed at blocking China’s access to advanced US semiconductors and technologies.

While American businesses are likely to see more shipments approved in the next couple of weeks, the export licensing regime is here to stay, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

He noted that, according to official rules set by China’s Commerce Ministry, applications for export licenses can take up to 45 working days to be approved.

“In principle, I can agree to export to you, but I can speed things up or slow them down. In reality, on a technical level, it also depends on the overall bilateral trade and economic atmosphere,” he said. “If the bilateral relationship is good, then I’ll go a bit faster; if not, I’ll slow down. But you can’t say I’m violating the agreement – I’m still following the standard procedures.”

Some Chinese suppliers of US companies have recently received six-month export licenses, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday, but it noted that uncertainty remains amid a large backlog of license applications.

Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the importance Trump attaches to rare earths shows how effective China’s “rare earth card” is.

“I hadn’t realized just how important this rare earth card was before. Now the US side is clearly anxious and eager to resolve this issue,” he [said](https://video.weibo.com/show?fid=1034:5174525722296333) in a video on social media on Thursday. “But of course, we’ll link this issue to others – the US is restricting China on chips and jet engines, then China certainly has every reason to make use of this card.”

“As for whether China will change its rare earth export control policy, that probably still needs to be negotiated in more detail” Jin added.

Some Chinese scholars have expressed hope that US technology restrictions on China may now be up for negotiation, after Trump announced that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick – whose department overseas US export controls – will join Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the next round of trade talks.

“The issue of US export controls may no longer be an area that is completely non-negotiable in the future,” Cui Fan, an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and advisor to the Chinese Commerce Ministry, wrote in a social media post.

Beijing has insisted that its export controls are in line with international practices, non-discriminatory and not targeted at any specific country.

Hours before the two leaders jumped on the phone on Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry reiterated that stance at a regular news conference, citing the “clear dual-use attributes” of rare earth materials. Dual-use items refer to those with both civilian and military applications.

“The Chinese government reviews export license applications for dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations, and for applications that meet the requirements, China will grant approval to promote and facilitate compliant trade,” spokesperson He Yongqian said.

The strict licensing system has significantly disrupted the global supplies of these materials and triggered production turmoil across industries in America and Europe, [raising alarms](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/business/eu-china-rare-earth-export-controls-intl-hnk) among officials and businesses alike.

A survey of member companies conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late week found that, among those affected by rare earth export controls, 75% say their stock would run out within three months.

Following a meeting in Paris this week, the European Union’s trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic [said](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/business/eu-china-rare-earth-export-controls-intl-hnk) he informed Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao about the “alarming situation in the European car industry” as a result of China’s rare earth throttlehold.

In a statement Saturday, China’s commerce ministry said that during his visit to Europe, Wang pledged to address the EU’s concerns and establish a “green channel” for eligible applications to expedite approvals.

The United States is ill prepared to confront the challenges of an increasingly hostile global strategic environment. A coordinated coalition of adversarial states is working to dismantle the US-led global order, seeking to replace it with one defined by their ambitions and autocratic principles. At the forefront of this effort is China, which is rapidly accelerating its military capabilities and expanding its defense industrial base (DIB) to field sophisticated weapons systems designed to deter the United States globally and secure its goal of national rejuvenation. Aligned with China are Russia, Iran, and North Korea—forming an increasingly unified axis of authoritarians steadily advancing toward this objective. Compounding these challenges are increasingly frayed traditional US security alliances, notably in Europe, that leave the United States further exposed.

he most effective strategy to contend with this evolving threat landscape is through robust preparedness—both immediate and long term. Against this background, US and allied attention has increasingly turned to Africa. Africa holds one-third of the world’s known mineral reserves, including 80 percent of platinum and chromium, 47 percent of cobalt, and 21 percent of graphite.

Of the fifty minerals identified as critical by the US Geological Survey (USGS), thirty-two are found in Africa. US policymakers have therefore begun to explore partnerships with African countries to secure these resources. Yet, despite several promising initiatives, the United States still lacks a coherent and comprehensive policy for engagement—particularly one that can compete with the entrenched influence of the axis of authoritarian states, notably Russia and China, in the continent’s mining industry.

By supporting African nations in the development of their domestic mineral processing capabilities, the United States could enable them to retain a greater share of their mineral wealth and build self-sufficiency in defense. Such efforts could also diminish China’s influence across the continent. For the United States, developing these capabilities could secure a reliable source of critical minerals.

* ***Identifying the defense capabilities the United States should prioritize to remain competitive in the evolving global strategic environment and the critical minerals necessary to support them.***
* ***Charting Africa’s critical mineral resources relevant to US defense needs and assessing the shifting defense postures of African nations, particularly where the development of their weapons systems and security objectives aligns with US interests.***

# JUNE 6th, 2025~ China’s rare earth weapon changes contours of trade war battlefield

[China’s rare earth weapon changes contours of trade war battlefield - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/web/chinas-rare-earth-weapon-changes-contours-of-trade-war-battlefield/)

China has signalled for more than 15 years that it was looking to weaponise areas of the global supply chain, a strategy modelled on longstanding American export controls Beijing views as aimed at stalling its rise.

The scramble in recent weeks to secure export licences for rare earths, capped by Thursday’s [telephone call](https://www.mining.com/web/trump-and-xi-agree-to-more-talks-as-trade-disputes-brew/) between US and Chinese leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, shows China has devised a better, more precisely targeted weapon for trade war.

Industry executives and analysts say while China is showing signs of approving more exports of the key elements, it will not dismantle its new system.

Modelled on the United States’ own, Beijing’s export licence system gives it unprecedented insight into supplier chokepoints in areas ranging from motors for electric vehicles to flight-control systems for guided missiles.

“China originally took inspiration for these export control methods from the comprehensive US sanctions regime,” said Zhu Junwei, a scholar at the Grandview Institution, a Beijing-based think tank focused on international relations.

“China has been trying to build its own export control systems since then, to be used as a last resort.”

After Thursday’s call, Trump said both leaders had been “straightening out some of the points, having to do mostly with rare earth magnets and some other things”.

He did not say whether China committed to speeding up licences for exports of rare earth magnets, after Washington curbed exports of chip design software and jet engines to Beijing in response to its perceived slow-rolling on licences.

***China holds a near-monopoly on rare earth magnets, a crucial component in EV motors.***

In April it added some of the most sophisticated types to an export control list in its trade war with the United States, forcing all exporters to apply to Beijing for licences.

That put a once-obscure department of China’s commerce ministry, with a staff of about 60, in charge of a chokepoint for global manufacturing.

The ministry did not immediately respond to *Reuters*‘ questions sent by fax.

Several European auto suppliers shut down production lines this week after running out of supplies. While China’s April curbs coincided with a broader package of retaliation against Washington’s tariffs, the measures apply globally.

***“Beijing has a degree of plausible deniability – no one can prove China is doing this on purpose,” said Noah Barkin, senior adviser at Rhodium Group, a China-focused US thinktank.***

***“But the rate of approvals is a pretty clear signal that China is sending a message, exerting pressure to prevent trade negotiations with the US leading to additional technology control.”***

China mines about 70% of the world’s rare earths but has a virtual monopoly on refining and processing.

Even if the pace of export approvals quickens as Trump suggested, the new system gives Beijing unprecedented glimpses of how companies in a supply chain deploy the rare earths it processes, European and US executives have warned.

Other governments are denied that insight because of the complexity of supply chain operations.

For example, hundreds of Japanese suppliers are believed to need China to approve export licences for rare earth magnets in coming weeks to avert production disruptions, said a person who has lobbied on their behalf with Beijing.

“It’s sharpening China’s scalpel,” said a US-based executive at a company seeking to piece together an alternative supply chain who sought anonymity.

**“It’s not a way to oversee the export of magnets, but a way to gain influence and advantage over America.”**

# Decades in the making

Fears that China could weaponise its global supply chain strength first emerged after its temporary ban of rare earth exports to Japan in 2010, following a territorial dispute.

As early as 1992, former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying, “The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.”

Beijing’s landmark 2020 Export Control Law broadened curbs to cover any items affecting national security, from critical goods and materials to technology and data.

China has since built its own sanctions power while pouring the equivalent of billions of dollars into developing workarounds in response to US policies.

In 2022, the United States put sweeping curbs on sales of advanced semiconductor chips and tools to China over concerns the technology could advance Beijing’s military power.

But the move failed to halt China’s development of advanced chips and artificial intelligence, analysts have said.

Beijing punched back a year later by introducing export licenses for gallium and germanium, and some graphite products. Exports to the United States of the two critical minerals, along with germanium, were banned last December.

In February China restricted exports of five more metals key to the defence and clean energy industries.

Analysts face a hard task in tracking the pace of China’s approvals following the Trump-Xi call.

“It’s virtually impossible to know what percentage of requests for non-military end users get approved because the data is not public and companies don’t want to publicly confirm either way,” said Cory Combs, a critical minerals analyst with Trivium, a policy consultancy focused on China.

# US F-35 stealth fighter has a 'kill switch', but it's controlled by China and not America

[US F-35 stealth fighter has a 'kill switch', but it's controlled by China and not America - The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/us-f-35-stealth-fighter-has-a-kill-switch-but-its-controlled-by-china-and-not-america/articleshow/121572954.cms?from=mdr)

[OEMS, AEROSPACE, DEFENSE, QUANTUM, & PRIVATE INDUSTRIES ALL NEED CRITICAL MINERALS](https://reddit.com/link/1l5ikst/video/3k8m5zsnch5f1/player)

If the United States of America goes to a war, the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter will play a pivotal role as it is considered to be the pinnacle of combat aircraft currently in active service worldwide by its makers. The fifth-generation fighter, in service with the defense forces of 10 countries while the same number of countries await their first F-35 jet, was rumored to have a ""kill switch"" which was vehemently denied by the US military and the aircraft makers Lockheed Martin.

Now, there is a new revelation which shows that the F-35 fighter has a ""kill switch"", but it is not in the control of the USA, Instead its arch-rival China is the one which can activate the ""kill switch"" to render the entire F-35 program ineffective. Not only the F-35, but China can also derail several other US military platforms and programs if its decides to go for the kill and America has absolutely no defence against such a move.

The programs and platforms which can be a non-starter or be rendered useless by the Chinese ""kill switch"" are the Boeing F-47 sixth-generation fighter aircraft announced by US President Donald Trump in May 2025, US Navy's Virginia-class submarines, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, armed Predator drones, Tomahawk cruise missiles, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) smart bombs apart from advanced radar systems deployed to track enemy aerial targets.

# So what is this kill switch?

China enjoys an unparallel domination in rare earths and critical elements, which are a critical component of almost all advanced weapon platforms. The country is not only the largest producer and consumer of rare earths, but also its biggest exporter. The US is so dependant on these rare earths and critical elements for maintaining its defense technological edge that over 80 per cent of its weapons system use them.

If China decides to play hardball and refuses to supply rare earths and critical elements to the US, the latter's defense industry will come to grinding halt. The Pentagon will be blinded in case there is a disruption in the supply of such critical components.

China has more that 90 per cent of the world’s processing and refining units of rare earths and it is responsible for the producing 98.8 percent of refined gallium in the world. Gallium plays an important role GPS systems and radars.

American combat aircraft airframes and missiles use magnesium while graphite and fluorspar can make or break the systems used for rocket propulsion, lasers, and nuclear fuel processing. In all the three mentioned minerals, China is the fulcrum with is massive refining capacity  
During the recent talks on the tariff wars unleased by President Trump, the big ace up Beijing's sleeve was its near monopoly in the production and refining of critical elements and rare earths.

During the recent talks on the tariff wars unleased by President Trump, the big ace up Beijing's sleeve was its near monopoly in the production and refining of critical elements and rare earths.

China had in 2023 cracked down on the export of eight gallium-related and six germanium-related products. It had a year later in 2024 also curbed export of antimony, another critical element. In the last few months, starting December 2024, China has completely stopped the export of gallium, germanium and antimony to the US. Critical defence related elements like tungsten and tellurium, too, have been placed on the restricted list by China.

When President Trump announced his steep “reciprocal tariffs” taking effect against China on April 2, two days later Beijing responded by imposing curbs on the export of medium and heavy rare earth elements including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium. The restricted items also includes magnets and other rare earths products.

If this situation continues, most of America's most advanced weapons will turn into duds if China raises its great wall to completely ban the export of such critical components. All of these are used in combat aircraft, missiles, naval warships, submarines and advanced radar systems.

# Which US weapons depend on China

A F-35 engine, avionics, munitions and radar use over 400kg rare earth elements. Similarly Virginia-class submarines and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of the US Navy have 4,200kg and 2,360kg of rare earths in their systems. Cruise missiles, armed drones, smart bombs, and radars depend on rare earth magnets for propulsion, targeting and guidance.

With the F-47 fighter on the drawing board, the demand for rare earths and critical elements will only increase.

Almost 81 percent of Antimony used in the F-16 Fighting Falcon as well as Minuteman III nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles is refined in China, although it is mined mostly in Australia. Even the US sends several critical minerals to China for refining and then re-imports them.

# None of the current technologies can replace the use of rare earths and critical elements in the advanced weapons and China's near monopoly, especially in refining, is a clear and present danger to the US forces, which have no counter to this ""kill switch"".

## Key Features analysis

The best espresso K-Cups offer a blend of convenience and quality,aiming to replicate the experience of a freshly pulled shot of espresso within the limitations of the K-Cup system.

**Flavor Profile**

A Great Espresso K-Cup should deliver a rich, bold flavor that captures the essence of traditional espresso.This includes a balance of bitterness, sweetness, and acidity, often with notes of chocolate, caramel, or nuts. The flavor should be pronounced enough to stand out, whether consumed straight or used as a base for lattes and cappuccinos. The best options will also offer a variety of blends to suit different palate preferences.

**Intensity**

The intensity, often measured by roast level and caffeine content, is a crucial factor for espresso. Espresso K-Cups should provide a robust and stimulating experience, delivering a noticeable energy boost. Stronger blends are favored by those seeking a powerful caffeine kick, while milder options may appeal to those who prefer a more balanced experience.

**Crema Production**

While achieving a true espresso crema with a K-Cup is challenging, the best products attempt to simulate this characteristic. Some K-Cups are designed with features like pressurized brewing to create a foamy layer on top. The quality and longevity of this faux crema contribute to the overall sensory experience and visual appeal of the espresso.

**Compatibility**

Espresso K-Cups are designed to work with Keurig brewing systems, but not all K-Cups are compatible with all Keurig models. It is important to check compatibility before making a purchase. Some K-Cups may be exclusively designed for specific Keurig models, while others offer universal compatibility. Ensuring a proper fit will prevent brewing issues.

**Packaging and freshness**

The packaging impacts the freshness and quality of the coffee. Ideally, each K-Cup should be individually sealed to prevent exposure to air and moisture, which can degrade the coffee's flavor and aroma over time. Nitrogen flushing is another technique used to preserve freshness.

**Sustainability Considerations**

Many consumers are increasingly concerned with the environmental impact of single-serve coffee pods. The best brands are actively working on more sustainable packaging solutions, such as recyclable or compostable K-Cups. This allows consumers to enjoy the convenience of K-Cups while minimizing their environmental footprint.

**Ease of Use:** The simplicity of using espresso K-Cups makes them accessible to anyone, regardless of their coffee-making expertise. This eliminates the learning curve associated with traditional espresso machines.Even novice coffee drinkers can easily brew a satisfying shot of espresso.

Throwaway because I don't want him to see this post. Basically my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, he's just moved in with me, which makes this even more complicated. He's a good man, I think, compared to my other relationships, in which I was always like a second option or they just ghosted me or chose someone else over me/went back to an ex. He tells me he loves me every day, he sends me cute pictures, he buys me gifts all the time, he tries to cook for me, makes me coffee, tea, snacks, helps with cleaning, picks me up when needing a lift, etc. I like his family as well. However, there is one issue that keeps creeping up since like the 1.5 year mark of us being together.

He makes very subtle jealous comments almost every single day. I am a very independent woman, I make okay money, I have my own car and flat, I have a great career, two degrees, travelled a lot alone, and I am not scare to do things on my own, and he knew about this. He knows that I value freedom and being trusted, but that I am always loyal. If he asks me a question I will answer it no doubt, so I am kind of like an open book for him, that's why I don't understand the whole thing. Plus we are together like 95% of the time, because we both tend to work from home, and he also knows my friends and he knows mine. 

Anyways, back to the comments. When i call him out on the comments, he said he is just joking or I've misunderstood him. For instance, I have a tiktok account and I told him jokingly I don't want men to follow me on it because they are creeps, and he said he is so grateful that is dating a girl who is not after men messaging her on her account. I told him what the hell, like who do you think I am? He said there are girls that cheat on their man on tiktok. I replied that there are multiple women on tiktok who don't, he said I misunderstood him. He is also questioning me why the algorithm on his instagram suggest him reels about men who got cheated on by women (like do I control your feed??). I was also getting ready the other day to go the doctor, and he was asking why am i putting on makeup, when i was just literally putting on moisturiser and brushing my brows. He also told me that he is happy that my girlfriends are really aggressive towards men who approach us at parties, so that I won't be around men. I told him that sometimes I feel like my friends are really rude, because how is a man supposed to know we are taken, you can tell them in a polite way. I also told him that once I was at a concert of a boy-duo, and because the stage was so small me and my friend were able to be on the stage with them dancing. He was mortified after hearing this, and asked if we have gone backstage with them, even if this was way before I met him (I would never do something like that, even if I did, why would he judge me? I just liked those boys' music and I love clubbing). He's also made comments to what I am wearing, and he also commented on the music I listen to. I prefer melodic songs, more on the sad side, because I love very expressive lyrics. He told me I listen to these songs because I am sad and I want to leave him. I also like to listen to Charli XCX's Brat album, and he said Brat is about women who go out to clubs to be with other men and who hate their boyfriends. I feel sometimes scared and trapped after these comments, but when I told him I am scared he will hurt me and he broke down crying, saying he doesn't understand why I would ever say that and that he would never hurt me. He is a good man overall, and he's just moved in with me and also moved countries for me and quit his job, and I feel like this would be a huge blow if I called this off now when he's starting a new life here with me. I also feel like maybe I am just looking for excuses to not like him and not stick with this relationship.

Tldr: my boyfriend makes jealous comments all the time, but he denies his ill-intention, and plays them off. How should I handle this?",0,1749294585.0,relationships,4,0.5,False

Can’t tell if they’re kibble or some sort of animal poop. He doesn’t get fed kibble, he gets powdered food I mix with water.

At first I suspected rabbit poop but my garden is reasonably well fenced and we don’t really get wild rabbits here (Scotland, new build estate with gardens all back-to-back) and I’ve been here 3 years and not once seen one.

They were too close together to be thrown by someone (all packed together in about the diameter of a coffee mug) and unlikely they’d been dropped by a passing bird that picked up a bin bag or something, spilling the contents mid-flight.

They don’t smell like poop either but also don’t really smell like kibble and are not terribly uniform in shape but still all roughly the same size 🤷‍♂️

I’m on a call around noon and smell something suspiciously familiar wafting in from the break room.

Tell me why this woman—let’s call her Debbie the Dumpster—is sitting at the table with my Tupperware open, CHOWING DOWN. Like it’s hers. Like it’s community soup kitchen hour.

I just stop and go, “Uhh… that’s literally my lunch?”

She blinks, mouth full, and goes,

“Oh, I didn’t see your name on it. Plus it looked like it was sitting there a while. I didn’t think anyone would mind.”

Ma’am. It’s 12:07. You think it fossilized in 7 minutes?

I said, “It WAS labeled. I wrote it with a Sharpie. In all caps.”

She shrugs and says—brace yourself—

“Well maybe next time don’t bring something that smells so good if you don’t want people asking.”

ASKING.
SHE. DIDN’T. ASK.

I walked away before I launched the damn office chair through a window.

But oh, the story doesn’t end there.
I went nuclear, with elegance.

The next week, I brought in another lunch—but this time I filled the container with plain white rice and poured a liberal amount of ghost pepper extract on it. Like, weaponized levels. Labeled it with the same handwriting.

I didn’t eat it. I waited.

12:15 PM—boom. Debbie’s in the break room again. I peek over the cubicle and catch her drinking milk out of the coffee creamer bottle, tears in her eyes. Gasping.

She didn’t steal anyone’s lunch after that.

My partner and I are planning to move in the near future and are currently working through what our budget could look like and also working out our expectations of a new place.

We have been staying in a small 2bed place, ex council house I imagine, just outside of the city to keep our costs low. At the moment, we spend about 30% of our income on housing (rent and council tax included). While we are mostly happy with where we are and feel no financial pinch, i will say the area is a cultural desert, bit dreary and doesn't really make me excited to get out the house to go for a walk in my local area.

We want to make a move somewhere closer to the city, to be nearer amenities such as coffee places, maybe a bar (thats not a scary old man pub) or a nice park. Also somewhere with a bitore younger demographic. So we have been considering the obvious choices like Dennitstoun, South Side and Partick.

But the rent costs have completely skyrocketed it just seems like a crazy decision to make right now and we keep wondering whether its worth it and are wondering how much of a squeeze on income other people living in the more desirable parts of Glasgow are experiencing.

Anyway, with that in mind - i was wondering what percentage of your income you all spent on your housing costs, especially if you live in or near the more desirable locations (Southside, Dennitstoun, Partick). Also do you like living where you live?

# Saturday reading: Mini-decisions lead to maxi-decisions

Few relapses are intentional. The stated intent of all people trying to change is to take actions and to maintain their progress until they are free of their problem. But it is easy to fool ourselves. We may make any number of “mini-decisions” that ultimately have negative consequences… Some such decisions might include keeping extra servings of current-risk binge foods in the house “in case company drops by” or deciding to go for coffee or a walk (healthy activities on their own) in a high-risk business or neighbourhood instead of doing the same thing in a safer place where you are less likely to run into high-risk people or things. It could mean falling behind in self care or deciding that you don’t necessarily need to make a plan for the next risk situation that is coming up.

Such mini-decisions can lead you to begin shifting away from maintenance and toward relapse. Before you know it, you may find that you’ve gone back to your old ways, never having made a conscious “maxi-decision” to relapse.

1l5i450,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1l5i450/writeup_and_advice_from_rome_florence_and_ostia/,"Write-up and advice from Rome, Florence and Ostia in May","A few thoughts from a May 22nd-27th highly successful trip to Rome and Florence. My Vatican Museums booking was cancelled because the Pope wanted to do an all-staff meeting there that morning, so I decided to leave the Vatican entirely for another time and visit Ostia instead.

My main surprise about Rome was its scale. In the UK, we get excited about a small bit of Roman wall and patch of mosaic. There, the Forum and Palatine Hill area is a kilometre across, Ostia Antica is a kilometre across, both packed with vast buildings. Even the Pantheon is far bigger than it looks in pictures. Across Rome, buildings and ruins that would be a star attraction in most other cities don’t even get a sign.

As such, it would always have been impossible to ‘do’ Rome in three days – as well as the Vatican, I’ll have to come back another time for things like the National Gallery and the Baths of Caracalla. Florence, on the other hand, is compact and I felt like I ‘did’ it in two full days – the Palazzo Pitti was the only real gap, though nothing there looks unmissable.

I found both cities very safe. Compared with Spain, where I’ve gone the previous two years, I thought Italy did some things better and others not quite as well, neither being the things one might assume.

The airport was great, compared with long and angry queues for passport control in Spain; the trains were efficient (except for some confusing validation machines), with central Italy looking green and attractive from the window, where Spain is more desert-like; and it was always easy to find good and not too busy bakeries, cafés and restaurants. I did have some mild irritations with Italian hotels: I stayed in two 3\*s and a 5\*, and they all had 11am checkouts (rather than 12pm), all had not very hot water, and all had no or minimal tea and coffee in the room. In fact, Italian coffee overall was surprisingly not that great, though the rest of the food and drink was up to expectations.

These were my thoughts on individual attractions:

\-            Colosseum with Attic ticket. The Attic was definitely a good bag, it’s a large section with the best view and almost no-one in it, compared with the crowded main route.

\-            Forum and Palatine Hill. Huge and confusing, because so many Roman buildings were rebuilt several times with old material, and there’s always some current work going on. Very evocative though. Having SUPER sites on your ticket gives you access to various interiors and is worth it.

\-            Ostia Antica. As above.

\-            Ostia beach. A good bay but the Italian system of most of it being fenced off as private, pay-for areas means the public areas are only small and far apart. (Spain wins on this one.)

\-            Galleria Doria Pamphilj. Loved this. Not crowded at all, free audioguide, and you get to be alone in a room with one of the best paintings in the world – Velazquez’s Pope Innocent X.

\-            Borghese Gallery – not at its best when I saw it, with many of the rooms under refurbishment and half the Caravaggios out at the National Gallery exhibition. Has some of Bernini’s best sculptures. Has a cachet as it’s hard to get a ticket, but I wouldn’t say unmissable.

\-            Pantheon – quick and easy to do, don’t miss.

\-            Trevi Fountain – is impressive but always crowded, Spanish Steps are quite close and empty at night.

\-            Uffizi Gallery with Vasari Corridor. Great art but very full. I postponed this trip for several years so as to do the Corridor – to be honest it’s alright but over-restored to the point of losing character (as the paintings in the Gallery are). They got a lot of criticism for removing all the pictures in it – clearly they’ve listened to that and are putting sculptures in instead, but those were still under sheets when I was there.

\-            Accademia – again packed. You kind of have to see Michelangelo’s David if you’re in Florence, but everything else there is missable.

\-            Palazzo Vecchio with Secret Passages tour –  one big painted hall and lots of smaller apartments with painted walls and ceilings. Expensive and the secret passages is only one little bit – it was OK but with hindsight I might have swapped with Palazzo Pitti.

\-            Duomo – Brunelleschi Pass. Loved the dome climb, though not recommended for people scared of heights. Whereas most such climbs are just a long spiral staircase with a couple of landings, this one you go round the interior of the dome on high, narrow walkways. Bell tower climb is not as good as it’s straight up and caged in, though gives the high view onto the dome. Museum is worth it for Ghiberti’s doors. Baptistry is under restoration for the next few years. Queues are massive early in the day but thin right out later.

\-            Bargello – sculpture and decorative arts are a turn-off for many people, but I’d say worth it. Star piece is Donatello’s David.

Final couple of tips on all these pre-booked tickets. Some do demand you show ID – I kept leaving my passport in the hotel, they accepted my UK driving licence each time but it worried me a little. Also, do not leave until you’re definitely ready to – take one step outside the exit and they won’t let you back in.

Charlotte, your videos always make me laugh and I love your reactions! I wish you and Mike all the best, love and happiness in your marriage. I'm sure you will look absolutely stunning on your wedding day and it will be an Amazing day!

I (28F) got married to the love of my life (27M) last year. While dating and engaged, we lived in a small shed converted into a bedroom / living space in my in-laws' backyard. My husband's friend, let's call him Jack, lives in another state so he flew over and stayed with us for a few days leading up to our wedding. Don't worry, on the night before the wedding, I stayed at my parents' house so my husband did not see me or my dress until the ceremony began on our big day.

Jack is not a bad person and is a nice enough guy but it's his habits that I'm not the biggest fan of. Jack is a heavy smoker and drinker, my husband and I are not. I'm talking first thing Jack does when he wakes up is smoke a pack of cigarettes and starts drinking as soon as he can, doesn't matter what the time is. He smells strongly of cigarettes and was just a slob during his short stay with us. Let's also just say that Jack is not the most hygienic person around.

After the wedding was over and Jack left, my husband and I had to clean up after him. He left multiple energy drink cans and cups all over the place, some empty, some half drunk, empty cigarette packs on the coffee table, even when we had a garbage bin right there by the door. The blankets and pillows that he used were scattered on the floor and it took a while to get rid of the cigarette smell. He always smoked outside but because he smokes so often, the smell just latches onto him, follows him everywhere and lingers.

A few months after our wedding, my husband and I managed to buy and move into our own home. I love our house and try to avoid making a mess as much as I can. It's nice, it's cozy, it's ours.

One day, my husband gets off the phone. Jack told my husband that he intends to come down to see the house and wants to stay with us for 4 weeks. My immediate reaction was Absolutely Not! After last time? No! Why 4 weeks? I don't know but what I do know is that I don't want our house to smell like cigarettes and I don't want to have to clean up after him when I come home after work. I don't want our house to turn into a pigsty while my husband and I are at work. I originally said he can stay a week tops but many conversations later, my husband and I compromised and settled on 2 weeks instead of 4. My husband assured me he will set house rules and make sure Jack follows them.

Little side story, my husband visited Jack and stayed at his apartment for a few days. Jack is single and lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, my husband told me it smelled bad. He had to sleep on the world's tiniest 2 seater couch covered in mystery stains with a pillow equally covered in unknown stains. Shoes, dirty clothes, soft drink bottles, takeout boxes and who knows what littered all over the place. My husband FaceTimed me one night when he was alone in the apartment and showed me the kitchen sink where there were plates with mould growing on them, I wish I was making that up. There's more to that trip but that's a story for another time.

My husband is not entirely thrilled about Jack staying with us either, we've talked about my feelings on the subject and he agrees with me for the most parts. We have talked about my husband potentially cutting him off seeing that Jack doesn't contribute much to our lives however, Jack is the friend he's known for the longest time. They've known each other since the beginning of high school so he doesn't want to ruin years of friendship. Plus Jack struggles with mental health and my husband is worried that if he starts being distant and goes no contact, then Jack would k--- himself. Jack has made comments in the past like he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for my husband, how if they weren't friends he would leave this world for good,...you get the idea. My husband doesn't want that guilt on his conscience if That does happen and I honestly don't blame him.

So yeah, Jack's flight is in a few weeks and I am not looking forward to it. AITA for really not wanting my husband's friend to stay with us? Am I overreacting?",3,1749293538.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,0.81,False

I know a lot of you guys can knock something like this out in a weekend or two, but for me (a homeowner learning as I go), it took about two months of nights and weekends to get it all done. Pretty proud of how it turned out.

I started from nothing... had to demo some old concrete, dig and pour new footers, frame it all up, and then install composite decking and railings. The deck’s about 16x20, framed with 12"" OC joists and topped with TimberTech boards. I also added fascia, lattice skirting, and a few lighting features later on.

It was a fun (and exhausting) mix of planning, problem-solving, and a lot of physical work. Along the way I had to work around tight setbacks and make it all fit cleanly with the house and yard.

My corgi made himself as the unpaid project manager—mostly supervised from under the joists and offered zero help but plenty of encouragement!

We’ve already used the space a ton...for dinners outside, family hangouts, and just relaxing with coffee in the morning.

1l5hvs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1l5hvs4/28_m4f_indiaonline_i_want_to_connect_with_more/,28 [M4F] India/Online - I want to connect with more life long learners and lovers of knowlege,"I have always been a lover of knowledge and wisdom. I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models. 

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me. 

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it. 

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world 

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages). 

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.  

  
Subjects I like learning about 

* **Mathematics** \- I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* **Programming** \- I love participating in programming contests
* **Chess** \- I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* **Reading** \- I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction. 
* **Sports Trivia -** The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before. 

There are various other topics I am interested in - even if I am not an expert in them like psychology, history, international affairs and so on. 

Mediums I like to keep track of information from 

* Podcasts - I do love listening to podcasts. I recently heard a podcast about the differences between natural an lab made diamonds and learnt about the economics of the jewellery industry. I listen to podcasts about science outreach, international affairs an a few fictional ones too in my native language. 
* Books 
* Blogs - I follow some blogs like Quanta
* Magazines - I have subscriptions to MIT Technology Review, Wired and New in Chess. I also follow some free magazines like IEEE Spectrum and Resonance.
* Reddit - I try to curate my feed to get new bits of information now and then. I have found out about things as esoteric as a world coffee championship through Reddit. 

  
I love organising things I learn in notes in beautiful ways. I maintain notes about it - though I am not always regular in updating it. I would love to know about different systems other people have and learn more. 

I look forward to getting to know you. ",3,1749292850.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

**Inorbit Mall**, normal chill day, and I ended up living a mini movie.

I was just doing my thing, roaming around, grabbed food at the court.  
That’s when I saw her. Walked in with her girl bestie.

And bro — she wasn’t even trying.  
Cream kurti, jeans, hair in this messy bun, cute lil flicks falling on her face…  
and her eyes?? idk man, soft hazel maybe? Big, calm — like she already knew something I didn’t.

She had that *quiet energy* — deep in thought, even while smiling.

They sat near the Hamleys side. I was opposite.

We kinda crossed while ordering food.  
**Eye contact** — once, twice... then that *one tiny smile.*  
And I froze. lol.

Your boy didn’t even TRY to say hi.  
Just sat there, sipping BK coffee like some side character in my own life.

Then boom — **plot twist.**  
She walked to the BK counter (near my table), ordered fries. Was right there.  
I still didn’t turn around. Coffee suddenly became the most interesting thing on earth. ☕

Thought that’s it. *Over.*

Then I hear:

> “Excuse me, can I sit here if no one’s gonna come?”

I looked up… it’s **her.**

Legit shook. Heart skipped. Tried to play it cool.  
She smiled, sat down.

First thing she says —  
> “I don’t really like the coffee here.”

And my dumbass, tryna flirt, goes —  
> “Yeah, I thought the coffee would be as creamy as your eyes.” 💀

But she laughed. Blushed.  
Somehow we started talking. It was easy. No pressure.  
She said she comes there often, lives close by.

After ~15 mins, her friend came back. She stood up, said she had to leave.  
We shook hands. Shared a small smile. Said bye.

And just like that — gone.  
No name. No number. No Insta. Nothing.

Only thing I know —  
**she visits often.**

So yeah, Dear Crush, if you're reading this somehow…  
**I still owe you fries.** 🍟

Sooo... here goes nothing.

I (30 f) am not good at keeping relationships. In fact I've never been in a relationship that lasted longer than ten months… except one.  
It ended ten years ago after almost two years of being together on his birthday of all days, when we decided mutually that it was over after I mourned the fact I had to see his mother when his family was coming over to have ""Kaffee & Kuchen"" (coffee & cake, it's a German thing, kind of like afternoon tea, but earlier in the afternoon and reserved for special occasions mostly.)  
Now I've been carrying all of this around with me for ten years now and given I've recently gotten back into contact with my Ex (34 m), who himself was mostly a very lovely person and my best friend for the duration of our relationship, I thought it was time to face up to all these memories and just share this story. Writing stuff like this down, is a great way for me to work through it, for she's a Karen and I wanna stop giving her so much space in my head. She even had the short blonde hair back then…

 

Anyway, let's start at the beginning. My Ex, I shall call Carl is the older of two sons and looking back it seems clear he was her favourite. In the beginning she was rather pleasant and nice, making some off hand comments, that went right over my head or were perceived as compliments. It actually took Carl telling me that she was making fun of me, to realise what was going on. But oh boy… it felt like the only thing she actually liked about me, was my hair. For its funky colours would piss off her own mother in law. (Who btw, was an a-hole as well, who literally brought me to tears during ""Kaffee & Kuchen"" at her house once.)

But she would mock me for being afraid of dogs, for liking cats more than dogs, for not having a degree, for my clothing choices, for my favourite music.. for literally anything.  
She did have a kinder side that sometimes came out, like when we bonded over both biting our nails… yet she would mock me for that as well at a later point.  
And given my lack of social insight and me not getting that I was mocked, seemed to spur her on even more, making sure I knew she mocked me without giving me true confirmation. Like a school bully.

It really got serious when I moved in with Carl and she was like: ""Well I would have come an cleaned your flat for you, but now that OP is living with you, she can do it.""  
Now I am not good at cleaning, doing housework or any of that. And at the time my disability way as of yet undiagnosed and untreated, thus I was not in the state of mind or place to run a household or be an adequate partner to him.  
Yet instead of conversation all I got from his family was shame and criticism.  
And looking back I see that I was not always perfect and prim and proper and could be huge a-hole as well, but it felt like the only way to stand up for myself against being bullied by Karen.

But the height of audacity came, when I had to go to the urologist due to an UTI that would not go away. So I went to the  urologist, given my grandma goes there as well. Now Karen is a med tech, aka. a doctors assistant that worked in the same practice.  
The doctor decided they needed to take a urine sample via catheter, meaning someone's going to thread a plastic tube up my urethra into my bladder…  
Given Karen is my boyfriend's mom I specifically asked the staff that the procedure would not done by her.

But who walks in, explaining that she's the only one who's free right now, gloving up and acting like she is going to do this now? Right Karen…  
I tried protesting again. Again she dismissed my protest stating it would mean a longer wait and to stop being such a ninny. Unable to argue with that she took the sample and left me to get dressed again, feeling deeply violated.

Shortly after that his aunt & uncle threatened to evict him from his flat (which is in a house they own), unless he kicks me out, so Karen can come and clean up my messes. I can't of course prove that Karen had anything to do with it, but at this point it seems rather likely.

Shortly afterwards our relationship took a huge dip and he discovered that the feelings for me are pretty much gone. I felt similarly in addition to no longer wanting to put up with his family.

Luckily I have not seen Karen ever since. But… she still manages to worm her way into my life. As I mentioned, my grandma also goes to visit the urologist, Karen works at. And given Carl went to family functions and his parents came to dinner at my parents home, they have met there and recognized each other.

Now last year, I was at my parents house and my grandma was over to visit. We talked about my most recent relation which had ended in 2023 and then my grandma mentions Carl and Karen.  
And she literally told me: ""It's a shame that ended between you two, had you just been a bit more cleanly.""

While I was teetering on the brink of a meltdown, my mom in a very rare occurrence, actually came to my defence and was like: ""What utter bullshit am I hearing right now? Carl was just as messy and didn't clean either. Is she supposed to this all alone? We are no longer living in the 50's.""

Turns out whenever my Nan would go to the urologist, Karen would chit chat with her… about me. How sad it is that the relationship ended and how it was all due to me \*refusing\* to clean up after him.  
I told her the real reasons and kindly asked her to refrain from sharing \*ANY\* details of my live with Karen and also told her how badly I had felt treated by her. My grandma felt really bad as she is just happy to talk to anyone and a bit naïve in some situations.

As I said, now I am kind of back in contact with my ex, given I moved back to my hometown and we share a hobby. Given he never stood up for me against his mom, apart from kind of calling out her mocking but usually joining right in, I have no plans to reconnect on a deeper level aside from sharing a few niceties from time to time. Yet the memories of his mother, haunt me to this day, as I felt treated so cruelly by her just because I was dating her son, when she should be happy for the both of us.

So that's the story of my EX-almost-MIL from hell… or what seemed like it at least..

I thank you for reading this & have nice day!

Byee\~

PS: I love you Charlotte, your videos make me happy whenever I am having a bad day <3

PPS: And I do call her almost-MIL given Carl and I did talk about our future and possibly getting married. So the relationship was pretty serious at one point.",4,1749292240.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.84,False

**Inorbit Mall**, normal chill day, and I ended up living a mini movie.

I was just doing my thing, roaming around, grabbed food at the court.  
That’s when I saw her. Walked in with her girl bestie.

And bro — she wasn’t even trying.  
Cream kurti, jeans, hair in this messy bun, cute lil flicks falling on her face…  
and her eyes?? idk man, soft hazel maybe? Big, calm — like she already knew something I didn’t.

She had that *quiet energy* — deep in thought, even while smiling.

They sat near the Hamleys side. I was opposite.

We kinda crossed while ordering food.  
**Eye contact** — once, twice... then that *one tiny smile.*  
And I froze. lol.

Your boy didn’t even TRY to say hi.  
Just sat there, sipping BK coffee like some side character in my own life.

Then boom — **plot twist.**  
She walked to the BK counter (near my table), ordered fries. Was right there.  
I still didn’t turn around. Coffee suddenly became the most interesting thing on earth. ☕

Thought that’s it. *Over.*

Then I hear:

> “Excuse me, can I sit here if no one’s gonna come?”

I looked up… it’s **her.**

Legit shook. Heart skipped. Tried to play it cool.  
She smiled, sat down.

First thing she says —  
> “I don’t really like the coffee here.”

And my dumbass, tryna flirt, goes —  
> “Yeah, I thought the coffee would be as creamy as your eyes.” 💀

But she laughed. Blushed.  
Somehow we started talking. It was easy. No pressure.  
She said she comes there often, lives close by.

After ~15 mins, her friend came back. She stood up, said she had to leave.  
We shook hands. Shared a small smile. Said bye.

And just like that — gone.  
No name. No number. No Insta. Nothing.

Only thing I know —  
**she visits often.**

So yeah, dear crush, if you're reading this somehow…  
**I still owe you fries.** 🍟  
And maybe a better line next time. 😅",3,1749292103.0,vadodara,17,0.64,False

Feels nice. I can see why people post here.



I didn’t plan on a part two. I figured I would share the weird thing that happened to me on the scary story board, and people would be happy with that. But I guess I told the story so good, you want more. I get it. The only problem is, what happened next is even harder to believe. I’m not sure I even believe it myself.



Here’s the logical explanation: After I fell in the water, I passed out, some weird things happened in my head, and then I woke up. That happens, right? People pass out and see heaven, or an alternate life where they’re Chinese. Maybe that’s what happened to me.



When I woke up, I was laid out on the dirty tile floor of the pool lobby, surrounded by gawkers and paramedics. My target was gone. She was the one that alerted the clerk I had fallen in. I guess she saved my life. I don’t understand why she would do that, but I reckon I’m thankful.



But... that’s not all I remember about that night. In my head, there was a whole lot more to it. There was a… something, in the water. Then a boat. Then an island. I felt like I was in that “room” all night, but the clerk says he pulled me out only a couple minutes after I fell in. It doesn’t make sense.



When I wrote the first part, I was convinced that I had imagined all of the stuff in between. But over the last few nights, I’ve been dreaming about it constantly. I’m not a creative person, so I find it hard to believe my brain could come up with all of this. And it feels so real to me; I can still remember the sea creatures, and the man on the boat’s smile, and the sand.



I’ll never understand why people care to read this shit, but… I guess I’ll just tell you what I remember, and let you decide for yourselves whether I’m making it all up.



—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



“Come back you fucking bitch!” I screamed in the dark. “Open the fucking door!”



I splashed my arms against the water, furious.



How had I fallen in? I saw how far away the door was from the pool before the pool lights went out, and I wasn’t anywhere close. In fact, I was seconds away from grabbing the handle and getting out. But then, all at once, the floor was water. It didn’t make sense. It’s like the pool had reached out and grabbed me.



“Good trick! Yeah, alright, you got me!” I shouted again, my words muffled like a pouty child screaming into a pillow. She couldn’t hear me. She was free, and I was here in this fucking pool.



*You’re stuck with it tonight*, she had said.



Stupid, random bullshit. What, was she trying to scare me? Act like I was taking her place watching over whatever was in the water? Right. No, the truth was that I had severely misjudged distances, and the size of the pool, and I was just turned around. If I picked a direction and swam, I’d find the edge eventually.



So, I started swimming.



The salt water had flooded my eyes when I fell into the pool, and they were stinging like a motherfucker. Not that they were doing me much good anyways. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.



I couldn’t find the edge anywhere. And I was starting to get tired.



To make matters worse, my goddamn clothes were sticking to me like cling wrap. I could feel them getting heavier and heavier, dragging against my every stroke. I couldn’t go on swimming like this. I would have to strip.



I peeled off my shirt and let it sink silently down to the bottom of the pool. It skimmed my foot on the way down. I realized then that I hadn’t touched the bottom yet. How deep did this pool go?



There’s a stretch of the Wharfe River in Yorkshire, England called The Strid. It’s only 6 feet across, and from the outside, it looks like any other quaint English creek. If you made the mistake of taking a swim, however, you’d take one step into the water and quickly realize that the bottom is 700 feet beneath.



In my mind, the pool was even deeper. I imagined diving down, feeling for the bottom, swimming past schools of fish, sea turtles, shipwrecks, leviathans with tentacles a mile long…



I patted myself down and found that all my tools were still on my belt: the wire, the gun, and the gloves.



The idea of dropping my gun was akin to cutting off my hand. I didn’t feel right without it. And the wire was compact enough that I could easily just keep it in the waistband of my briefs. The gloves, however, had to go. I released them into the darkness, followed by my shoes, my socks, and my pants. There I was, treading water in my underwear with a gun in my hand, like an Alcatraz escapee. 



That’s when I felt something brush my bare foot.



It felt like the playful tickle of a finger.



I kicked out instinctively, and when I did I made contact with something. It was smooth and squishy like… well, like human skin. 



Like someone was swimming beneath me.



“What the fuck?” I screamed, my words still a useless rattle in my head. My entire body pulled up like I was trying to fold in on myself. “Get the fuck away!”



I pointed the gun down into the water in panic and pulled the trigger. I barely heard the gunshot; it sounded like a balloon popping fifty feet over my roof. I felt the pressure change as the bullet whizzed past my leg, and I realized in a split second that I had been inches away from shooting off my own foot. I hadn’t planned on shooting. Frankly, I was surprised the gun still fired after so long in the water. It was completely instinctual. So, when the recoil flashed up my arm, it slipped right out of my hands.



“No, no, no!”



I reached down desperately to catch it. I got a finger across the barrel, still hot from the gunshot, but it bounced right off and dropped like a stone down through the dark waters into the deep. Just like that, my gun was gone.



“Fuck me!” I cried. 



I had no idea if I had hit anything, but considering it was a literal shot in the dark, the odds weren’t in my favor. More than likely, the thing (I didn’t want to entertain the idea that it was a human being) was still somewhere below the surface of the water. Hell, it could be right in front of me, staring into my eyes silently, watching me, and I would’ve had no idea; that was how complete the darkness was. The idea was enough to turn my stomach.



For a moment I imagined I could hear it breathing beside me, but I quickly shook the illusion. I took a few deep breaths of my own and composed myself.



That must be the “it” my target was referring to as she left. I guess it found me.



There was nothing I could do about that. If this thing was trying to kill me, it could have done that a long time ago. Not to mention, if this thing was lethal, why would that woman choose to swim with it every week?



If it was still here, I just wished it wouldn’t touch me again. That was a wish that I’m pretty sure didn’t come true.



I kept swimming. 



It didn’t take long before I saw the lights.



Between strokes, I picked up a faint glow in the distance.



My heart leapt. The door? Had I swam all this time, for what felt like hours now, and finally reached the exit? *Just keep swimming* was all she told me, and I did what she said.



But… this wasn’t a single point of light. The shape was all wrong, nothing like an open door, and the color was off too. It looked like the residual blue on the horizon after the sunset; like a soft brushstroke laid along the surface of the waters ahead.



I began to swim faster. Whatever it was, it was better than darkness. My body was beginning to ache, the skin on my extremities was completely pruned, and I was feeling nauseous from all the salt water I’d accidentally drank. The worst part, though, was that the water was getting colder. It felt like I had swam out of the shallows on a summer coast and into the middle of the Pacific. My energy was almost depleted. I had to get out of the water.



As I approached, I thought about Virgo’s. The idea of a nice hot burnt cup of coffee sounded like a dream. When I got home, I was going to give Mike the biggest hug. (And I did, too. He hated it almost as much as I did)



The closer I got to the light, the more vast it seemed. I think it was moving towards me, too, because before I even realized it, the light had begun to envelop me. All around was a sea of little blue points of light, like phosphorescent jellyfish, or algae, or something. It was like swimming in stars. 



I’m not a whimsical person. But this was… wonderful. For a brief moment, I forgot how tired I was, and the dull ache of my muscles muted to a distant buzz. I scooped out a handful of water. I had one of them in my hand. It was alive, I think, because it drifted from one end of my hand-pool to the other, then back again; not really swimming, but floating with intention. What a cool creature. My curiosity satisfied, I poured it back into the water to be with its friends again.



As I did, I saw the outline of my hand against the glowing water. I could *see* something. I hadn’t even registered that fact until that moment.



I looked down into the water and saw my legs kicking among the blue spots.I saw the pattern on my underwear. I saw the hair on my shirtless chest. After hours of being in complete and total darkness, without even the ability to cross my eyes and see my nose, I could actually see *myself* again. Trumpets sounded. The Heavens rejoiced. I was over the fucking moon.



It occurred to me, in my euphoria, that maybe the blue creatures marked the beginning of a different zone of this place. If there was light now, then maybe there would be sound again, too. Dare I dream?



“Hello?” I said tentatively. The words didn’t dribble from my lips; they sounded out across the waters. Beyond the vibrations in my head, I could actually hear myself again, too.



I realized then that up until that point, I had already mentally forfeited my life to the darkness. Though I kept swimming, hope had quietly packed up and left me. Eventually, the creature below would pull me down to join it, or I would follow my clothes and sink down to the unknown depths of this cursed fucking pool.



But, with my senses returned, I found a second wind. I had to get the hell out of this place.



“AHHHHHH!” I shouted. I don’t really want to admit how long I made senseless, barbaric noises, just savoring the sound of my own voice.



“I’m coming home, bitch! I’m coming!”



I spun around in the expanse of blue light.



That’s when I heard a *snap*. Not like a branch cracking; like fingers.



I stopped spinning. There was something a few feet away from me in the water, sticking straight up like a tree branch.



As my eyes focused, my smile eroded from my face in an instant.



It was a human hand. And it was waving.



I recoiled, screaming. I splashed violently at the water in an attempt to move away from it. This was the creature–the hand that had grazed my foot. God only knew what the rest of it looked like beneath the water, but I had a hard time imagining it was human. 



The hand didn’t chase me. It stopped waving and did another gesture: it laid its palm flat and moved the hand down towards the water. I understood it. *Hush*, it was saying, like a teacher at an assembly lowering the kids’ volume level.



I stopped moving away. I stared at the hand, my brow furrowed, panting. Any moment it would lurch forward to drown me. Any… moment…



Instead, it gestured again: it pointed one long index finger directly at me (*You!,* it said) and then beckoned me, folding its fingers into its palm repeatedly (*Come here*).



“No, no, stay the fuck away from me,” I said. I had no idea if the thing could understand me, but I said it anyways. “Don’t touch me.”



The hand gave me a thumbs up. *Okay, I won’t*.



I was still scared to death of the thing. I don’t know if it was a trick of the light or not, but it seemed like it was floating closer and closer to me. I would swim back, subtly, and it would close the gap. It wanted to be near me. Horrifying.



It did several more gestures, but at the time, I had no idea what it was trying to tell me. First, it bounced its palm against the water, skimming. *A wave?* I thought. I hadn’t seen a single wave since I had started swimming. It was a pool, after all.



Next, with a flat hand, it plunged in the water, and stayed for a moment. *Dive*? *Hide*? I wasn’t sure. 



Then, it made its index and ring fingers into legs and ran with them along the water, away from me. *Run*, or *run away*, perhaps, but I wasn’t following. From what? From a wave? From it? It occurred to me that this could just be some twisted game the creature liked to play. Tantalus-style torture, maybe, just like the kind I thought my client might be enacting against the woman. Now, though, I understood why my client wanted me to get her before she touched the water. It was a portal of some kind, to the domain of this strange creature. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter what it communicated, it was trying to hurt me, somehow.



Finally, it pointed at me again, this time with the thumb up like a finger gun, and then brought the hammer down. *Bang*.



Was it referring to when I shot at it earlier?



“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” I said, frustrated. “Can… can you understand me?” The idea that it could understand my words made me deeply uncomfortable. It had no ears, and a human wouldn’t be able to hear me underwater. But if it could, then perhaps it could tell me how to get out of this place.



The hand gave a thumbs up.



I wasn’t sure what to make of that. I chose to stop worrying. I was powerless. If the hand, whatever it was, wanted to hurt me, there was nothing I could do about that. But, on the off chance it wanted to help me, I needed to stop being so damn scared and communicate with the thing.



“How do I get out of here?” I asked softly.



The hand didn’t move for a while.



“Listen, I’m sorry I shot at you, I didn’t mean to, I swear to God,” I said, “but you gotta help me out, here. I’m tired, and I need to get out of the water.”



The hand still didn’t move.



“Alright, you know what…” I began, but just then, I started to hear a noise.



*hmmmmmmmmmm*



It was coming from behind me. I turned around to see a shape moving along the water in my direction. A boat?



I looked back at the hand with a smile on my face. It was gesturing wildly. *Wave* (?), *hide, run away*, *bang*.



I grew tired of the creature’s game. 



*HMMMMMMMMMMM*



The shadow of the boat grew larger as it approached; I saw a kerosene lamp on board, and by its light I could make out the figure of a man waving his arm over his head. Help had arrived. 



“Over here!” I cried. I began to swim towards the boat.



Suddenly, the hand was in front of me. *Hush*, it gestured. *Run.*



Emboldened by the prospect of freedom, I swam right past it. It didn’t reach out to touch me, just like it said it wouldn’t.



I began to have doubts. Was the hand truly trying to help me after all?



No, no. I remembered its little trick underwater with my foot that nearly caused me to shoot my toes off, and its silence when I asked for help. The person on the boat was a man; the thing in the water wasn’t. Even if this guy wasn’t of the purest intention, he still had a boat. Worst case scenario, I would commandeer it. I still had the length of wire. In any case, it beat being in the water with this… thing.



“I’m here!” I cried through a mouthful of salt water. The paddling was more than my body could handle. My swimming slowed to a crawl. God, I remember how cold I felt just then, chilled down to the bone. I don’t think I could have lasted another ten minutes in that water.



I heard a splash.



Underlit by the blue light, like the woman’s face, I saw a life preserver bobbing in the ripples.



“I see you, buddy!” the man called from the boat. He had a soothing, confident voice, like he wasn’t worried at all.



With my last vestiges of strength, I swam in long strokes towards the disc, quickly closing the distance.



Just as the ends of my fingers touched the rope laced around the edges of the preserver, the hand appeared again. It gripped the preserver, and began to drag it away from my reach.



“No!” I shouted helplessly. I tried to follow after it, but I was moving at a snail’s pace now, my head thundering, my chest heaving up and down, each breath draining traces of salt water into my lungs and stomach. I was starting to drown. It was much more subtle than they make it seem in movies.



“I don’t think so, you little bastard!” the man hollered, and then came the blast of a shotgun. Reflexively I ducked my head underwater. Thousands of the little blue creatures drifted around me in that peaceful moment. I looked down at my body. I was still intact–not a single hole in me, and no pain.



I popped my head above the surface and saw that the hand was gone.



The life preserver, though, was still too far for me to reach.



My head dipped back underwater again, this time without my permission. But I was powerless to fight it. I was beginning to sink.



A peace fell over me. All the glowing creatures around me seemed to close in, and then dim, slowly, slowly, until it was as dark as before they arrived. Perhaps I would find out how deep the pool went, after all. Frankly, it was a better ending than I deserved. So of course, I didn’t get it.



I felt a hand grab mine.



When I awoke, I was aboard the boat. I was wearing several layers of clothing now, dry clothing, and I could see by the glow of the lamp that the boat’s captain was seated across from me, reloading his shotgun and looking anxiously at me as I stirred.



“Oh, thank god,” he gasped. “ I thought I did all that mouth-to-mouth for nothing.” Then he laughed, a hearty belly laugh.



I sat up slowly. My head was still pounding, and I was shaking from the cold, but I could feel the tingle of my nerves in my extremities, and I knew that I would be okay after a while.



“Thank you,” I managed. I coughed. My throat was sore from the salt water. That was weird to me. Growing up, my mom would make me gargle salt water to *treat* a sore throat. I guess there’s a big difference between gargling and drinking.



“Listen, try to stay close to the lamp, alright?” he said. I nodded and shuffled closer to it.



There was a sizzling sound. Through the lamplight I could see that the captain had a small gas stove set up in the corner, and he was frying something up in a mini cast iron pan.



“I got some fish in the cooler I’m about to fry up, if you want some,” he offered. “This here is for me though. Appetizer.”



Whatever it was, it smelled delicious. Eating hadn’t even crossed my mind in the water, but I realized then that I was absolutely starving. It felt like an eternity ago that I had walked down the employee hallway and placed by hand against the mysterious black door.



The captain poured what looked like a handful’s worth of nuts into a bowl and blew on them to cool.



“Well, I’m glad I came by when I did,” he said. “That thing in the water…”



“I’m glad, t-too,” I stuttered. ""I was… al-almost dead.”



“I know, man, you were bluer than the algae when I pulled you up,” he laughed. I managed a smile, but I didn’t really want to think about it. I was warm now, at least.



“Listen, I know you probably just want to rest but, I gotta ask: how the hell did you end up all the way out here?”



“Long story,” I said simply.



“We got time,” he said. ""It's a good trip.""



“Where are we going?”



“Welp… that’s up to you, I guess. I was headed north, up to the coast, but I suppose if you wanted me to, I could take you south, back home.” He didn’t sound thrilled about the idea, but I nearly leapt out of my seat. I would’ve, too, if it wasn’t for a throbbing pain in my foot when I put pressure on it.



“Could you really? I-I’m dying to get out of here, man. Please.” I sounded more desperate than I wanted, but it was hard to contain it. 



“You got it, brotha,” he said, and with a swift maneuver of the on-board engine, he turned the boat around and started us on our way.



I felt the wind blowing through my hair as we cut through the darkness. The boat bounced up and down, slapping against the water in a rhythmic hum. I remembered the hand’s first obtuse gesture, the *wave*, and I suddenly understood it: *boat*. The message finally clicked. 



*Hide and run from the boat, he has a gun*.



Clearly, that was a warning only the creature needed to heed. If the hand had its way, I would be drowned by now. I looked over the sides of the boat to see if I could make out any figures following us in the glowing blue water, but I couldn’t. *Good riddance*, I thought.



The nuts had apparently cooled, so the captain took them in his hand and threw one back with a loud *CRUNCH*.



My stomach grumbled. My foot ached, a little more than everything else. I must’ve hit it on something when the captain pulled me into the boat. I couldn’t be mad at the guy.



“You think you could manage that story, now?” he asked me, an eyebrow raised.



So I told him. I told him everything I told you all in my first post, about the job, the woman, the room. He just listened quietly, nodding along. 



“So, you were going to kill that blonde woman, huh?” he asked.



I didn’t know he knew her. I figured she was as much of an interloper in this weird place as I was.



“Yeah. That’s my job where I’m from,” I said, hoping he wouldn’t take it personally.



“I wish you woulda killed her,” he grumbled.



That was interesting. Not only did he know her, but he wanted her dead, too.



“I tried,” I said. “I didn’t expect… this.”



I looked overboard and saw that the algae had dispersed, and the water was once again dark. The lamp was the only light.



“I’ve been trying too, man.”



“To… kill? That woman?”



“Oh yeah. I’m out here hunting for her constantly. But that fucking hand… they communicate with each other. It’s like they’re friends or something. Every time I think I found her, she disappears.” He sighed and threw back another nut with a *CRUNCH,* even louder this time.



“Why?” I asked.



“Why does the hand help her, or why am I trying to kill her?”



“Both, I guess.”



“She helped the hand, and now it helps her. That’s all I know, really. As far as my hunting her… it’s complicated,” he said with a shrug.



“We got time,” I reminded him. He smiled.



“Not much more. We’re just about here,” he said. “All you really need to know is that they put me here to protect the island, and she’s a threat. Simple as.”



He turned off the engine. We slowed down to a stop in the water.



“Are we here?” I asked.



“Almost,” he said thoughtfully. “You know something, man?”



I looked around at the darkness, hoping to find the light of the doorway somewhere in it. Why did we stop short? Did he really know where the exit was exactly, or would I have to find it myself? As long as I didn’t have to get back in the water…



“What’s that?” I replied absently.



“It’s just us out here,” he said. “In all this dark.”



I looked at him. He was just sitting there looking back. I took him in for the first time: he had broad shoulders, 5’o’clock shadow, and a dark coat on. His hand was still cupped holding the roasted nuts, and he threw another back. He looked like anyone else back home; like any guy on the street.



I also noticed that the gun he had been cleaning before was now resting casually on his knee, pointed straight at me.



“Is it really? Aren’t there other people in this place?” I asked, as calmly as possible.



“Maybe. But for now, out here… it’s just us. You know something else?”



“What?”



“I could do anything I want to you right now, and no one could stop me.”



I didn’t move. I focused on keeping my breath even. I just smiled at him politely.



“Like what?” I asked.



“*Anything*. Don’t you listen?” he said. He was talking just like before, no change in his tone. Just like any guy on the street.



“Take off your sock,” he demanded quietly.



“Why?”



“Because I asked you to.”



“Which one?”



“The one that’s been hurting you.”



I reached down cautiously to my left foot and peeled off the sock he had placed over it while I had been asleep.



Beneath, it was a mess of blood. The clumsy remains of my toes were wrapped in seeping red bandages. As I realized the extent of the injury, the pain came rushing in. My entire leg throbbed.



The captain threw back another “nut” with an even louder ***CRUNCH***.



He laughed, a deep belly laugh. “Isn’t that a great moment?” he said. He extended the last toe to me. “Here, I saved the big one for you.” He laughed again.



I laughed too. I didn’t know what else to do. 



“Why?” I asked. I couldn’t understand. 



I had no desire to scream. I wasn’t really all that afraid, even; just like in the water, my body had accepted that I was going to die. In my line of work, every job is a chance at death, so life doesn’t mean so much. All I really wanted to understand was why this was happening–why wouldn't he let me go home?



“They used to let me eat the escapees, but not anymore. I still got a taste for it. Consider it your toll,” he said casually.



“No, you fucking monster,” I growled, “why can’t I leave?”



“Oh, that. Well, here’s the deal: I don’t protect the island by keeping people out,” the captain said. “I keep ‘em in.”



I set my foot back down on the ground. It flashed with pain as the bandages made contact with the wood.



“Look real close,” he said. “See, way out there?”



I looked out in the distance. At first, I saw nothing. But after a few moments, I started to make out a light against the darkness–just a small pinpoint of yellow.



“That’s the Island. I figured I’d give you just a glimpse. That’s where your blonde friend’s from. She escaped a long time ago. And now, she keeps coming back to help others escape, too.”



“Why-” I began, fighting down a wave of pain, “-don’t you just let me go to the Island?”



“What, so I can have another blonde bitch clone to give me trouble? Listen, if you’d have killed her, I would’ve let you go to the island toll free–hell, I might’ve even let you leave–but you didn’t,” he said. “ So now, it’s time to tie up loose ends.”



I squinted as he brought the shotgun up out of his lap and leveled it at me.



Then I heard a clatter.



I glanced down. It was my gun.



The captain and I looked overboard simultaneously.



There was the hand, poking out of the water. I could barely see it by the lamplight.



It pointed a finger gun at the captain and dropped the hammer. *Bang*. Then it was gone.



I had the hand’s message all wrong. It was the same message it probably told the blonde woman as she swam away from the island: *If the boat comes: hide, run, and when all else fails… Bang*.



The captain and I both looked down at the gun again. Then I sprang for it.



I had it in my hand when I felt a peppering of buckshot in my right shoulder.



The blast was deafening. Weak and disoriented already, my head swam and my ears rang at the sound.



The kerosene lamp fell. I heard it shatter on the ground as the boat descended into darkness.



I switched the pistol to my left hand. I had no idea where the captain was, nor if the pistol would fire a second time, but I pulled the trigger anyway.



Another blind shot.



*Bang.*



I knew he was dead when I heard the splatter of his brain on the hull.



All was quiet for a long moment. I lowered my pistol to my side, placing it in my jacket pocket. It was hard to believe I almost didn’t take it along with me.



But then, I heard a horrible wail. It was a long, wretched cry of mourning.



It was coming from the Island.



Immediately, I heard something approaching quickly from my left.



It started as a low grumble, and slowly swelled into a thunderous roar.



I ducked down, holding tightly to the rib of the boat. It was a wave. I could feel the waters shifting beneath me long before it arrived.



The water folded on top of me with unimaginable force. The small boat didn’t stand a chance–I was torn free and tossed helplessly through the black waters. Everything was a swirl of motion. I reared up out of the water to catch my breath, only to be beaten back under by another wave, and another, until I was certain that I would never surface again. 



In the tumult, I caught glimpses of the pinpoint of yellow light growing brighter and brighter, until it was like the sun shining down on me.



I’m certain that at some point I felt a hand tugging on my collar, but at what point, and whose, I couldn’t possibly say.



When I awoke, I was lying on the sandy shores of the Island.",7,1749291955.0,nosleep,1,0.82,False

To prepare, I downloaded Drake’s original nautical charts from the National Library of Australia and copied them by hand in paper (along with some Naughty Dog original pages from the in-game journal). I used a fountain pen and black and red De Atramentis ink (because that ink is EXTREMELY waterproof) on 90 grams cheap paper (I needed some thickness for next step). 

Then, I bathed pages in fresh black tea for a few minutes and spread some drops of instant coffee on top for extra fungi-like stains. I dried the pages and the oven tray with kitchen paper before I put them into the oven. 150º, 6 minutes (preheated)  
  
Finally I left them under some weights for the night (wrapped in oven paper, so they would not stain anything)

# 3 Micro-Workflows Worth Your Coffee Break

|Pain it Solves|What You Do|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Copy A/B fatigue**|Break the prompt into micro-tasks: headline → body → CTA — and test each slice separately in ChatGPT.|Keeps variables clean and hits the **Content-Creation** primitive that OpenAI says drives the fastest wins for marketers.|
|**Brand-tone drift**|Paste a 1-paragraph “voice sample” from your best campaign into every prompt. Let GPT mimic it automatically.|The guide shows AI “writes in your company’s style” when you feed it in-context examples.|
|**Blank-page ideation**|Drag raw focus-group notes (or screenshots) into ChatGPT and ask for headline angles before you brainstorm.|Uploading docs unlocks instant research insight; Match Group even simulates focus groups this way.|

# Why You Should Care

* **Saves real hours:** Promega shaved **135 hours** off email production in six months just by letting GPT draft first versions.
* **Keeps momentum high:** All three hacks land in the **high-impact / low-effort** quadrant that OpenAI recommends starting with, so you get quick wins without red tape.
* **Scales with your stack:** Each trick maps to one of the six core primitives (content, research, automation) that OpenAI says will future-proof your workflow.

**Next Steps (15-Minute Sprint)**

1. **Pick one live campaign.** Slice the brief into the three prompt chunks above.
2. **Drop your best-performing paragraph** into ChatGPT as a tone reference; generate 5 variant headlines.
3. **Upload last quarter’s survey notes** and ask: “What fresh angles did we miss?”
4. **Ship an A/B test** by EOD and tag results source=GPT in your CMS so you can track lift later.
