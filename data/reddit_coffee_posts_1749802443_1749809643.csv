1lac54x,https://i.redd.it/jx3l8gvw4o6f1.jpeg,Copper in our water!,"I moved to rural Victoria last year.  We get our drinking water from a bore, which produces wonderful water.  The water gets pumped into a tank, then a pressure system supplies the house.

All good, except the tap water in the house tastes terrible.  If I drink the water straight, or make a coffee, I have a bitter metallic taste in my mouth for at least an hour afterwards.  Also, there's a light green residue in the coffee machine's water tank, and the shower base.

I thought perhaps this was because of copper in the water, so I bought some cheap test strips.  Sure enough, the tap water shows the highest reading for copper, which water from Melbourne doesn't.

I did some sniffing around.  Water from the bore going into the tank is copper free, as is an outside tap fed through the pressure system.  A test of the toilet cistern (closest to where the water enters the house) is also copper free, but the laundry next to it is high for copper, same as for the kitchen tap at the end of the house.

(The two rightmost strips show copper.  The left are the bore
What could cause copper in the water at some parts of the house, outside tap and cistern)

What could cause copper in the water in one part of the house but not another?  Is it possible for a brass fitting to leach its copper, or for a copper pipe to be leaching?  Is there some other explanation I haven't thought of?

1lac3ms,https://gofund.me/5f93ceea,Native Social Work Student Macro Project,"Mission:
I‚Äôm a survivor of religious and emotional sexual abuse, raised in a cult (Evangelicalism) that laid the groundwork for the MAGA movement. I‚Äôve fought for my life, returned to college at 29, and I‚Äôm now one semester away from graduating with a degree in Social Work. I need your help to finish my degree, continue healing, and turn my story into political resistance and community action.

My Story, Surviving Religious Sexual Abuse and Rebuilding My Life:

My name is David James Walter, and I‚Äôm a 33-year-old survivor of emotional sexual abuse at the hands of my father ‚Äî a man who led a religious cult. My body, mind, and identity were controlled, sexualized, and shamed from childhood in a toxic environment masquerading as faith.

For most of my life, I lived under the weight of untreated trauma. My twenties were marked by chronic depression, suicidal ideation, and overwhelming self-hatred. In 2021, I came terrifyingly close to ending my life by jumping from a parking garage. I truly believed my life had no worth.

But something in me refused to give up.

At age 29, in a last-ditch effort to create meaning from my pain, I re-enrolled in college. I chose social work. I wanted to understand what happened to me ‚Äî and how I could help others who were raised in similar systems of abuse and control. I found therapy. I found language for my pain: religious trauma, emotional sexual abuse, complex PTSD. And slowly, I began to rebuild.

Where I Am Now:

Today, I am thriving in many ways:

I‚Äôm earning straight As in my Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) program at Texas State University

I work two jobs ‚Äî as a barista and babysitter ‚Äî to support myself

I lead a men‚Äôs group and serve as a community builder at Epoch Coffee, a safe space in Austin

I‚Äôm in therapy, making art, and dreaming big again

But despite everything I‚Äôve overcome, I‚Äôm now facing an urgent barrier that could derail my entire healing journey.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why I Need Your Help Now:

My final semester requires a 30-hour/week unpaid internship in the social work field ‚Äî a full-time commitment on top of school. I simply cannot afford to do this unpaid labor while covering rent, food, therapy, and basic survival. I‚Äôm already buried in debt from years of untreated trauma and survival-mode living.

Working two jobs and going to school has taken everything out of me ‚Äî and now, I‚Äôm at the finish line with no resources left. If I can‚Äôt complete the internship, I can‚Äôt graduate.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for support:

To bridge this financial gap, finish my degree, and continue building the life I‚Äôve fought so hard for.

What Your Support Will Fund:

Your donations will go toward:

Basic living expenses (rent, food, bills) during my unpaid internship
Therapy and mental health care to continue healing
Paying down urgent debt that threatens my stability
Freeing up time to study and serve my internship clients well
Fueling my long-term goals of advocacy, community building, and writing a book.

Supporting Shari

While this fundraiser is primarily about helping me survive and graduate, I also want to be transparent that part of these funds will go toward helping someone else who has become deeply important to me.

Her name is Shari ‚Äî a brilliant, creative woman navigating homelessness, severe mental health challenges, and a system that has failed her at every level. We met through my job at Epoch Coffee, and she‚Äôs become a part of my life. She is kind, vibrant, and deeply deserving of support. Shari has been unable to maintain stable housing or employment due to her psychiatric disabilities, and she‚Äôs currently in a state of high vulnerability.

When I say I want to build a life that helps others ‚Äî I mean starting now, not waiting until I have a degree. Part of what you give will help me help Shari access housing, clothes, stability, and dignity. I see her humanity, and I want others to see it too. Your support lifts us both.

‚úä Turning Survival Into Political Resistance:

This campaign isn‚Äôt just about helping me get through school. It‚Äôs about something much bigger.

The cult I was raised in wasn‚Äôt just a personal tragedy ‚Äî it was a microcosm of the MAGA movement, a prototype of the Christian nationalist ideology that now threatens millions. I grew up under authoritarianism, toxic masculinity, and religious extremism ‚Äî long before it became a political platform.

Now, I‚Äôm committed to turning my survival into action.

I want to use my voice, story, and education to:

Fight religious extremism and MAGA authoritarianism
Hold abusers accountable ‚Äî including my father
Create healing materials for children of cults and spiritual abuse survivors
Build communities that prioritize dignity, equity, and belonging
Advocate for progressive mental health and anti-oppression policy
Uplift others who are still trapped in systems of shame and silence

This isn‚Äôt just a degree. This is resistance.

My Vision for the Future:

Once I graduate, I plan to:

Pursue my Master‚Äôs in Social Work at the University of Michigan ‚Äì Ann Arbor
Write a book and develop tools for healing religious and emotional sexual trauma
Continue helping vulnerable children through direct service and mentorship
Support community spaces like Epoch Coffee that foster connection and safety
Be a father figure to those who never had one
And most of all: fight back against the systems that nearly destroyed me

How You Can Help:

If my story resonates with you ‚Äî whether you‚Äôve known trauma, faced spiritual abuse, or just want to support someone turning pain into purpose ‚Äî I humbly ask for your support.

Every dollar helps me reach stability, graduate, and take this mission further.

If you can‚Äôt donate, please consider sharing this campaign with your network. Visibility matters.

From Rock Bottom to Rising:

I have dignity and worth ‚Äî even if my parents didn‚Äôt see it.
Even if the world didn‚Äôt make space for it.
Even if I didn‚Äôt believe it myself for a long time.

Now, I do.

And I‚Äôm asking for help not just to survive, but to rise ‚Äî and to help others rise too.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for believing in survivors.
Thank you for giving what you can.

With love and hope,

1lac12p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lac12p/dropped_a_coworker_home_a_few_time_and_she_always/,Dropped a coworker home a few time and she always expects lifts now. NEVER says thank you.,"There was a new coworker that joined our team a couple of months ago. Started chatting more and more and realised we lived close by one another. She's probably about 5 minutes away from me. (But we live in the city so that five minutes is completely dependent on traffic and is in the opposite direction of where we work).She doesn't drive and there was one evening that we were both working back late. I ended up offering her a lift as it seemed like the right thing to do. But I think she is starting to take the piss.

She now expects it almost daily. She never says thank you. Like ever. I don't need a parade thrown in my honour but come on, there needs to be some acknowledgement. It's adding an extra 10-15 minutes to my trip whenever I have to take her home by the time I drop her off and then go back to mine. She has never offered any fuel money - I wouldn't accept it but I think there should be the offer. Maybe shout a coffee once a week or something?

Unfortunately I've realised during this time that I actually don't like her as a person. She will spend the entire car trip (around 45 minutes or more) ONLY talking about herself. If I even try to talk about anything relating to myself or just random conversations topics she will shut it down immediately. For example

""Oh hey I checked out that new restaurant around the corner from you the other day. We tried the pasta you'd love it!'

""Oh nice.. yeah my sister is staying with me for a while blah blah blah"".


Usually she's only hitting me up for lifts back home but one morning she asked for a lift to work. I'm not a morning person and I have my routine down to the minute in the morning to maximise how long I can sleep in so I had to get up earlier for this. I begrudgingly agreed but we both had an early start for something so again, I justified it to myself as it was probably the right thing to do. I said okay make sure you're ready and outside I'll be at yours at 7 sharp. I messaged her when I was leaving to confirm and she said she would be outside waiting for me. I arrive at hers on the dot and she was not there. I waited a few minutes. I called. No answer. I called again. She answered. She was out of it. She had FALLEN ASLEEP on the couch waiting for me. I said um, I'm out the front. And she goes 'okay' and hangs up. Again, comes out minutes later. No acknowledgement. No apology. We ended up being late to work for something very important and the only reason I agreed to pick her up in the first place. She is actually finishing up so I don't have to deal with this any longer but far out. The audacity of some people never ceases to amaze me.",1,1749808727.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

If you spend 15 minutes with it, you‚Äôll walk away with:

# Five Payoffs You‚Äôll Get

# 1. See AI as your Super-Assistant

The guide shows how to off-load three work killers: repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and ‚Äúwhere-do-I-start?‚Äù ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

üëâ For eCommerce, that means less time writing 100 product descriptions and more time launching campaigns that convert.

# 2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins

Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

Think: seasonal promo planning, upsell email flows, product copy A/B testing, customer support automation, mapped in one glance.

# 3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours

Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

üëâ One eCommerce brand used ChatGPT to generate descriptions for 2,000 SKUs, reducing content creation time by 70%. That‚Äôs your catalog launched weeks faster.

# 4. A Two-Axis Prioritization Map

The Impact-vs-Effort matrix helps you rank ideas, nail ‚Äúhigh-ROI focus‚Äù projects, and shelve the shiny but time-sucking ones.

üëâ Running short on time before Black Friday? Use this matrix to fast-track AI for top-performing product categories.

# 5. A Vision for Full-Workflow Automation

The last section sketches how teams chain AI from deep research ‚Üí data crunch ‚Üí ideation ‚Üí copy ‚Üí auto-localization. It‚Äôs a teaser of where marketing ops is headed.

üëâ Imagine this flow: best-selling SKUs ‚Üí AI-led market trend analysis ‚Üí auto-generated ad copy + banners ‚Üí instant translation for international markets.

# Why It‚Äôs Worth Your Coffee Break

* **Zero jargon**: Written for business users, not engineers.
* **Field-tested**: Draws from 600+ enterprise use cases. No fluff, just real workflows.
* **Action items on almost every page**: Copy-paste prompts and checklists into your next planning doc.
* **Momentum builder**: Quick wins earn internal buy-in, which unlocks budget for bigger bets.
* üëâ For eCommerce teams, it‚Äôs the rare guide that talks less about AI theory, and more about how to prep your next launch faster, cheaper, better.

# Quick Start Challenge

Prompt to try today:

>I‚Äôm an eCommerce marketer. Here are 5 past product pages + our brand tone guide. Suggest 3 campaign themes for the next drop, each with 5 bullets, a CTA, and preview copy.

# Next step (3-Minute Plan)

1. **Download & Skim**: Grab the PDF and speed-read the headlines.
2. **Write a ‚ÄúPain List‚Äù**: Jot down 3 tasks from this week that felt repetitive or slow.
3. **Pick ONE Quick Win**: Circle the task with highest impact / lowest effort, drop it into ChatGPT, and measure how many minutes you save.

Done! You‚Äôve just taken your first step into AI-powered eCommerce marketing.

1lac01k,https://i.redd.it/kcacmhb83o6f1.jpeg,Tried This Trendy Espresso-Red Bull Combo ‚Äì Here's My Take! ‚ö°‚òï,"Lately, I‚Äôve seen this combination pop up in quite a few caf√©s, so I decided to try it at home. Here‚Äôs how I made it and what I thought:

**‚òï Recipe:**

* **Coffee:** Illy Espresso Medium Roast (Ground)
* **Equipment:** Bialetti Moka Pot
* **Other Ingredients:** Red Bull, Ice

**üßä Method:**

1. Brew a strong espresso concentrate using the Moka pot and Illy's medium roast grounds.
2. Fill a glass with ice.
3. Pour in **100 ml of Red Bull**.
4. Add **50 ml of espresso** on top.
5. Stir gently and serve immediately.

**üìù My Review:**  
While the espresso and Red Bull mix was interesting, I personally prefer **ginger ale** as a mixer. It gives a brighter, crisper contrast to the coffee without the overwhelming sweetness and added caffeine of Red Bull.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Caffeine Caution:**  
This combo can be intense! I limited myself to just **one cup for the entire day** to avoid a caffeine overload.

Feel free to tweak the ratio to match your flavor preference‚Äî**more Red Bull** for a fruity, fizzy twist, or **more espresso** if you like it bold and bitter.

Have you tried this combo yet? Would love to hear your thoughts! üëá

1labvp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1labvp0/confessions_of_a_night_watchman/,Confessions of a Night Watchman,"There‚Äôs a million NDAs I‚Äôm breaking right now, but I‚Äôve gotta say my piece. I‚Äôve contemplated whether the risks are worth it by telling this story online, but considering that I‚Äôve not got long to live on this earth anyways, I think that the pros outweigh the consequences. In a way, I guess this is sort of like an autobiography of sorts, I have no family, no one to care for me when I‚Äôm gone, I guess I just want to be remembered, by someone, somewhere. I‚Äôm not detailing the events that come later in this story to blow the whistle on anything, even if I did, the damned company probably hid its tracks too well, no, this story if you wish to call it that, is a confession from a night watchman.

I never managed to do more than work at a McDonalds growing up through high school, and between that and taking my dad to the VA clinic every week meant that I never had a chance to get any actionable job experience besides flipping burgers.

When I turned 25, my father died, and a few of his old Airborne buddies came to his funeral. One of them, Carl, was especially close to him, we each said our piece about him, the man was buried six feet deep, and just like that the life of a man was over. I didn‚Äôt really cry on his deathbed nor at his funeral, had too many things to plan for like his wake, the guest list, the after funeral luncheon, but when I saw a man who looked just like him, down to the facial expressions and his laugh, walk into the restaurant we were having lunch at, I just broke down in front of everyone. Grief has a weird sense of humor, your dad‚Äôs dead, and you won‚Äôt break down at his funeral or his deathbed, but then he‚Äôll send in someone who looks just like him down to the wrinkles and smile on his face to make you just lose it in front of everyone.

I never realized what dad had done during the war, when I asked him about it he always said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. We shared the rest of the car ride to Carl‚Äôs house talking about dad‚Äôs life, like the time him and the boys threw a massive foot long centipede into another squad‚Äôs tent, the time he body slammed a VC and bashed their head open with his M60, meeting a guy who claimed to be CIA going around giving beers to people of all things, how he eventually stopped being able to walk when I was 15, and how he had to be hooked up to an oxygen tank when I was 17.

When we arrived at Carl‚Äôs house, he offered me a job. Turns out some people really were born with a silver spoon in hand, because he turned out to have inherited his father‚Äôs small security company, so he offered me a starting position, as a favor to my late father.

After handing in my resignation at the burger joint I worked in, I got a security certification and started working at Carl‚Äôs company. It wasn‚Äôt too bad all things considered, I started small, working day security at strip malls, and later on in my career, at night I worked as a night watchman. For $5.00 an hour in 1983 money it wasn‚Äôt too bad for what was ostensibly a warm body in a box job.

During my night shifts I read books about biology, Tolkien, all the greats, and watched old Twilight Zone reruns on the old Panasonic portable tv, hiding it away when my supervisor came. All was well until one night I saw an intruder on the CCTV trying to break into a supply shed on my site.

I walked out, Maglite in hand to confront the individual, it was a drug addict trying to steal copper wires from some old conduit lines. I yelled at him to stop and the bastard turned around with crazed eyes, charging at me with his knife. I bopped him on the head out of instinct with my Maglite, but he kept charging at me, and knocked me on my ass. He didn‚Äôt stop until a fellow guard ran to my assistance, kicking him off me as I laid on the ground dazed. When the police came, I was still shaking like a leaf from the adrenaline 10 minutes later. As the medics cleared me, it turned out the man had tried to slit my throat with his knife.

I can still feel the cold steel on my throat, even after all these years, it‚Äôs like the knife had imprinted itself onto my skin, the only thing that saved me from that fate was the fact that the knife was blunt. I can still recall the feeling of my flesh bruising, the skin shifting around my neck muscles as the madman tried to saw his knife into my neck.

I decided to work armed security from there on, I got certified with a baton, and got my armed guard card three months later, a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson Model 10 rode on my hip from then on. After a few more years of dealing with druggies and violent winos, I had built up quite a reputation with Carl‚Äôs security firm. Carl wrote me a recommendation for my exemplary work as a night watchman, my reports were well written, my documentation was meticulous, and I never even had to fire a single shot in anger. I bid him farewell, and from there I got a new posting, and worked night security at a university where they had an Animal Biosafety Level 2 lab located on site, I did my usual duties, patrol around the outside for about 10 minutes, go into a locked log box and sign in to verify my presence, then it‚Äôs back inside for hot coffee and some more Twilight Zone reruns on that shitty old Panasonic portable. I only got paid $5.25 for this posting.

After another couple of months of this and I had enough, at the time, my ego deemed myself overqualified to just be paid 25 cents more an hour than my last job. At the time I thought it was insulting, did they even know how expensive it was to obtain an armed security license in California? So after a row with my supervisor I put in my 2 weeks and left.

I wished I had just swallowed my pride and just kept that job, but we all know what monstrosities and follies ego beget. Young men are impatient, at times rather impulsive. That‚Äôs how I got into trouble.

For the next two months or so I lived off my savings, my diet was never the most healthy, but eating McDonalds day and night at my old job meant I saved quite a lot of money.

I eventually got an interview with a firm called Multinational Biologics Applied, a medium sized firm located in South San Francisco, just an hour's drive from where I lived. The hiring application needed security guards who were trained or experienced working in A/BSL 2 or above labs to apply, and I signed on along with 10 other guys.

We were all excited, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of how the whole thing seemed strange. For one, they had hired us as armed security. Typically for corporate security jobs like this, it wouldn‚Äôt really make sense to have armed security, as our jobs were merely to observe and report to the police. We weren‚Äôt guarding a 711 in Skid Row, this was a sector of South SF with a massed concentration of high tech companies, so cops regularly patrol this area day and night. It would‚Äôve made more sense for the company to just hire us as unarmed security instead, after all it was much cheaper to have unarmed security, less liability too, especially since Multinational was hiring in house guards.

Worst case scenario is that we might have some of those bleeding heart types that try to break in and free some of the test animals. Not that it would do them any good, some of these animals were engineered with downregulated tumor suppressor genes in order to test for anti-cancer therapies, some were specifically bred with immune deficiencies for AIDS research, and the list goes on and on, but I digress.

Orientation went on, we sat through two hours of briefings on procedures and chains of command, SOPs on what to do if there are intruders, using the new electronic Detex watchclock systems, ID card activation and deactivation, using the computer control consoles in our posts, patrol routes, payroll, etc. The usual presentations flew by, I‚Äôm no rookie to this, after all, I worked the industry for almost 6 years, I‚Äôve arrested intruders, clocked in almost a million times, almost shot another druggie trying to steal copper piping from an old industrial site.

Then our security chief came up to the podium, he was a stocky man, handlebar mustache, graying slicked back hair, and a stainless steel Model 66 .357 Magnum rode on his hips. My guess at the time was ex-military of some kind.

Chief Harold Warner spoke in a southern accent, I‚Äôm guessing Virginian, and went through the usual spiel of ‚Äúwelcome to the company, we look forward to blah blah blah‚Äù.

Then Chief Warner took a more serious tone, I could still remember what he said to us in that moment to this day:

‚ÄúGents, by making it this far you have nearly crossed a point of no return. In a few moments we will be handing out some non disclosure agreements for you all to sign. Should we find out that you have at any point in time disclosed the nature of our employer‚Äôs work or research, you will be found in breach of contract. Your employment and pensions will be revoked, and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Anybody one who wishes to not sign this NDA, may do so, but know that you will no longer be employed by Multinational Biologics Applied. Your time today will be clocked by Personnel, and your pay checks will be mailed out to your addresses within the week.‚Äù

There was a pregnant pause in the small conference room, NDAs were not uncommon for these types of corporate jobs, after all, in the cutthroat field of biotech research there was much money to be made, but considering the tone of our future boss, everyone mulled over the decision. Something about the way he spoke rubbed all 10 of us in the room the wrong way.

There was a sense of urgency in his voice, imperceptible to most people, but working security gave you a sense of sussing out if someone was bullshitting you. ‚ÄúOh no man, I was just smoking a cigarette. What do you mean leave man? I‚Äôve got a ticket dude!‚Äù You hear enough excuses about kids smoking cigarettes and nothing else, or people pretending to have a ticket trying to sneak into a movie theater, you get a sense if someone‚Äôs trying to hide something.

The fact that there were 10 of us being hired onto a pretty damn good paying job all at once was also a bit strange to me at the time. Typically these positions are pretty competitive, a full pension, our $20/hour pay rate, full benefit for a non salaried position, you would have 10 year industry veterans chomping at the bits to get a sliver of what this posting had to offer. I'd only expect at most 2 or 3 of new guys being inducted, but there were 10 of us being hired all at once. Hell, I only applied to the job on a lark, thinking there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd hire someone like me, I was experienced sure, but there were guys out there with way more than me who could have easily been more qualified than I am.

In hindsight, this should have been my queue to leave, the whole thing stank with the smell of ‚ÄúToo-good-to-be-true flavored bullshit‚Äù, I was too greedy, na√Øve, or both.

We all signed the NDA, and after a few minutes of reading and signing, a woman came in and collected our contracts. Not really any backing out now.

The Chief smiled, and welcomed us to the team. The lights came on, and we all went on a tour of the facility. The first three levels of the ground level building were mostly conference rooms and office spaces. We walked past workers milling about in their cubicles, typing away on computers and calling clients, scrolling through Rolodexes, banging on fax machines and printers. A few guys at the water cooler talking about the Giants or the 49ers.

Then we walked past a set of double doors on the ground level garage room and into a large elevator, Warner took a keycard from his belt and swiped it against a console, and keyed in his code, and hit L1. The elevator took us to one of the three underground sections, when we got out we were a bit shocked to say the least.

L1 looked like something out of a bunker. Concrete walls with steel bolt reinforcements driven into the arches of the wall, harsh CFC bulbs lit up the damp corridor, there was a smell of mildew lingering in the air, I can still remember it clearly. Honestly thinking about it now still gives me nightmares even to this day. The tunnel that the elevator opened into was wide, wide enough to fit a whole semi truck, but the concrete construction, the moisture seeping in through the cracks of the wall, all of it seemed so claustrophobic.

The tunnel lead to a central atrium about 50 yards in, the wooden cargo crates and small Conex containers lined the sides of the tunnel. The center of the atrium housed a small security desk with a uniformed guard sitting in the middle, watching CCTV monitors, it split off into two other tunnels, one labeled ‚ÄúAnimal Labs‚Äù and the other ‚ÄúSecurity/Storage Areas‚Äù. Men and women in lab coats were walking through our group as Warner stopped and asked the guard to let us in. The glass door that slid open to let us in were pretty thick, strong enough to withstand bullets.

Warner gave us a tour of L1, told us how this was a cargo storage and BSL 2 lab section. Apparently, the site of our building used to be part of an ammo dump network the Army Corps of Engineers dug into the east side of the Bay Area Peninsula during the war, huge 200mm coastal artillery shells would be stored here in case the Japanese or the Germans invaded the West Coast. After the war, the army kept the facilities to store vehicles and arms for the National Guard unit in San Francisco, until the 70s, when the Army sold or leased it to private buyers and local city departments. The one by Fort Funston and the SF Zoo was to be turned into a water treatment plant by 95‚Äô. I drove by that on the Great Highway before, smelled like shit.

We arrived at the main security control room a minute later, stepping inside there were stacks of Manila folders with each of our names on it. Leafing through the binders there were a series of SOPs on specific scenarios, layouts of the facilities 1-3, and L1, the typical orientation dossiers

Warner specifically stated how we would only be guarding the ground level facilities for now, and that we would later be transferred into the lower levels. We would be guarding the main grounds surrounding the building, and finally L1 and how no one was to venture down to L2 and L3 unless a ‚ÄúCode June‚Äù was in effect. I flipped to the page labeled Code June, and found a hermetically sealed opaque plastic folder with a perforated rip away edge, it was labeled clearly, ‚ÄúPLAN: JUNE, DO NOT OPEN UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY YOUR SUPERVISOR OR IF CODE: JUNE HAS BEEN DECLARED.‚Äù

One of us asked Warner about what Code June or Plan June was, Warner simply rattled off some rote statement about how that was on a need to know basis, but the gist was that Code June had something to do with evacuating security evacuation plans of L2 and L3 in case of fire. We all knew it was something else, even Warner had that knowing look, but we moved on to the rest of the tour of the main security.

I remember leafing through the rest of the SOP book, it was odd. There were plans for nuclear material leaks, nitrogen and Freon gas leaks, power loss, intruders, a fire plan, an earthquake plan, and even tsunami evacuation procedures, but none of these were ever in regards to L2 and L3, it seemed that Code June and Plan June were the only procedures regarding levels L2 and L3, and they were on a need to know basis. At the time I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why. There were so many strange things about this place.

Multinational Biologics Applied was originally a company founded by ex-DARPA employees, in connection with some Japanese and German biotech firms. From my research at the time looking at their brochures and whatnot, I learned they were working with the HIV virus and developing novel cancer therapies using chimerically rearrange antigens on T-Cells, insecticides, herbicides, they were even researching ways of using bacteria or archaea to break down nuclear waste into nuclear fuel.

AIDS had just become a thing right when my dad died, we used to call it the Gay Disease. In 89‚Äô most of the guards were a bit afraid of that fact when we learned about the research taking place at MBA, as we were working with monkeys, rats, mice, etc. No guard wanted to be involved with an escaped monkey and get the AIDS. Of course, having read so much about biology in my spare time sitting around in a small shack during those cold winter nights assuaged my fears of getting zoonotic transmission of SIV from these test animals.

We were told to get dressed and gear up. We were issued the typical fare: leather duty belts, radios, pens, logbooks, a collapsible baton, a .38 revolver, spare ammo, a Maglite, handcuffs, gray shirt sleeve uniforms, gray BDU pants, black boots, you know the rest. This was 1989 we were talking about.


When we saw the rest of the room it felt like they were having us guard a WMD disposal site. There were CBRN decontamination kits, loaded with things like atropine and pralidoxime autoinjectors, which were meant to prevent nerve agents like VX and sarin from causing your muscles to seize up and literally asphyxiating you to death as your diaphragm and lungs spasm and you slip into complete respiratory failure or simply cardiac arrest.

Essentially, most organophosphorus based nerve agents like VX or Sarin arrested the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a molecule responsible for conducting muscular contractions in our muscle cells. If acetylcholine is not degraded in between the neuron and muscle cell and is simply allowed to build up in the synaptic cleft, it will cause continual contraction of the muscle cell, leading to continual seizures, diaphragm super contractions, neural excitotoxicity, and the list goes on. They had diazepam injectors available for those undergoing seizures from nerve agent exposure as well.

Warner explained how this lab was working with a lot of different experiments, each with their own hazards, for instance the use of CTXs, helotoxins, colchicinoids, beta-alkaloids, organophosphorus based toxins, all of which can arrest cellular mitosis via inhibition of tubulin formation, straight up mitochondrial poisoning and metabolic poisoning, necrosis and induced apoptosis, and the list goes on. Just a single spec of dust sized particles can kill a man within a few hours. 

As such, both the lab medical unit and security teams were equipped with a complement of PPE and post exposure medications.

Warner then took us through the showers and lockers, to a small room on the side with a window, the armorer started handing us our duty weapons. We were issued six shot Model 15-6 .38 caliber revolvers, loaded with what I think were 158 grain lead cast semiwadcutters hollowpoints , the box said ‚ÄúPlus P‚Äù on it. These things were pretty new looking, no wear or tear on the finish, no dents or scratches from being dropped or banged against a concrete wall. These things looked completely new in box, like the company had just recently purchased these. In fact, I noted at the time that most of our equipment was pretty much brand new. No scuffs on our leather pouches and holsters, brand new flashlights, everything was factory new in box almost. 

You have to understand, security guards at the time typically didn‚Äôt buy our own stuff, we might have our own boots, or maybe our own belts and belt keepers, maybe our own weapons, but everything down from the holster, the pouches, the radios, all of that was company or client issued. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to keep buying new stuff for every new guard on the job.

The point was, a lot of security guards typically got hand me downs from our predecessors, and while the other guys were oohing and ahhing over our new stuff, I still couldn‚Äôt shake the sense of unease. Everything had to happen for a reason, so why did this company give us all fancy new in box equipment? I tried to brush off this strange occurrence as just the company buying new equipment because they were expanding the security team. 

As if the whole thing didn‚Äôt seem strange enough, the next door Warner opened only made the whole ordeal even stranger.

When we stepped into the armory proper, we saw the concrete walls had been lined with steel wall lockers which when opened revealed racks of surplus M16A1s, Remington 12 gauges, and tactical vests. This was a lot of firepower for what supposedly a small security detail.

An armor rack was also next to the gun racks. Rows of black painted surplus steel helmets fitted with a riot visor and flak jackets adorned the cabinets. Today you might see a few security guards wearing armored vests, but back then that was unheard of, and especially not a riot helmet and body armor . The armory even had what I thought to be riot control agents like CS gas canisters, and gas masks.

The company wasn‚Äôt outfitting us to be a security detail, they were gearing us up like a SWAT team. 

Stranger still, there was another gun rack lined with unfamiliar rifles.

After asking around I found out that these were custom made CO2 actuated dart rifles firing .50 caliber ballistic syringes, one of my coworkers: David, said these were Anschutz air rifles, same brand as the ones he used to shoot with back at the shooting clubs in Germany, but these rifles appeared to be completely custom made of stainless steel construction, with dual steel CO2 cylinders mounted to either side, a bolt action locking breech, a rubberized pistol grip, rail mounted Thompson Center collimator sight, and a barrel clamp mounted Surefire light and laser sight. The thing looked and felt like one of those old anti tank rifles I‚Äôd seen in WW2 documentaries.

There were also thermomolded padded boxes of darts the length of a ballpoint penl and thick as a man‚Äôs finger, the labels on the boxes were labeled MORO 709, I asked around, and at the time I found out that these were supposedly tranquilizer darts.

Now, I understand that animal testing labs were supposed to carry some complement of animal recapture devices, should any test organisms escape, but these were usually smaller 5-10 CC darts, these ones seemed big enough to SLIP A BULL ELEPHANT INTO A COMA.

I didn‚Äôt ask too many questions, the job was too good, we were going to be paid $20 an hour, plus full dental and medical, I could finally set myself up a nice nest egg, finally move out of the roach infested hovel my landlord called a studio apartment. So I kept my mouth shut, and I did my job.

And I did, me and David were partnered into a patrol ‚Äústick‚Äù, learned early on that he was ex-Bundeswehr, from West Germany at the time. Even showed me a picture of his American fianc√© Patricia. David K√∂nig was an average looking man, dark haired, handsome, obviously well built considering that he volunteered to join the Bundeswehr instead of being conscripted in. We got along pretty well, we were typically assigned the morning to evening shift, meaning we‚Äôd be able to go and get a drink together at night. Of course the man would always complain about the piss water we were served, but at $1 for a pint, we were quite happy.

My friend would never make it to his own wedding in November.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1labpwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiworkPH/comments/1labpwr/is_our_break_schedule_and_work_hours_legal/,Is Our Break Schedule and Work Hours Legal? (Philippines),"Hi! I just want to ask for some advice regarding our current work setup. We‚Äôre based in the Philippines, and our company requires us to work from **8:00 AM to 5:30 PM**, Monday to Friday.



Here‚Äôs our daily schedule:



* üïó **8:00 AM ‚Äì 10:00 AM** ‚Äì Work (Paid)
* ‚òï **10:00 AM ‚Äì 10:15 AM** ‚Äì Morning Break (Unpaid)

* üçΩÔ∏è **12:00 NN ‚Äì 1:00 PM** ‚Äì Lunch Break (Unpaid, which I know is legal)
* üïê **1:00 PM ‚Äì 3:00 PM** ‚Äì Work (Paid)
* ‚òï **3:00 PM ‚Äì 3:15 PM** ‚Äì Afternoon Break (Unpaid)
* üïí **3:15 PM ‚Äì 5:30 PM** ‚Äì Work (Paid)





We are only paid for 8 hours, but since the 2 coffee breaks (15 mins each) are **unpaid**, we are required to work until **5:30 PM** to complete the full 8 hours of paid work.



My questions:



1. Aren‚Äôt short breaks under 20 minutes supposed to be **paid under DOLE rules**?
2. Is it legal for a company to **extend work hours** like this just to offset the unpaid breaks?
3. If found in violation, what are the possible actions DOLE can take?





I‚Äôm not trying to get anyone in trouble, I just want to know if this is legal or if we‚Äôre unknowingly getting underpaid for our time.

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 28 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include cooking, baking, knitting, sewing, reading, watching anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 179 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.

Writing a letter to someone I‚Äôve never met. But for some reason, I felt like doing it anyway. No idea if it‚Äôll reach the right person, but here I am.

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm hoping for with this. Maybe it‚Äôs connection. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired of feeling like something‚Äôs missing and needed to put this out there, somewhere. It‚Äôs not about being desperate. It‚Äôs more like wanting someone to finally get it.

So let me start with this.   
We don‚Äôt know each other yet and that‚Äôs kind of wild. Writing this not knowing if you‚Äôre even real or if we‚Äôll ever meet. But maybe you're out there. And maybe one day, I‚Äôll know what your laugh sounds like, what kind of music you listen to when you‚Äôre sad, or how you take your tea or coffee.

I want the small things. The daily stuff. The parts of a relationship that don‚Äôt show up in movies. Like sitting in silence without it feeling awkward. Or rushing through a Monday morning together. Or just grocery shopping and knowing each other‚Äôs favorite chips without asking.

I‚Äôm 23 now, trying to figure life out. I‚Äôve got this project I‚Äôm super into. It‚Äôs nerdy but it gives me purpose.

Someday I want to live somewhere quiet, maybe in the hills, with a dog that runs around like it owns the place. I want to read books in the sun and forget what day it is. Simple stuff, really. But real.

I just hope I don‚Äôt lose myself trying to get there. I don‚Äôt want to turn into someone who lives only for deadlines and KPIs. I hope I still laugh at stupid jokes and cry at movies and get excited over small things when we meet.

Maybe you‚Äôre reading this now. Maybe you're just killing time, scrolling through Reddit. Or maybe you‚Äôre like me, stuck in your own head, wondering if you‚Äôre ever going to find someone who feels like home.

If we‚Äôve already met and you‚Äôre reading this later, I hope you‚Äôre smiling and thinking, ‚ÄúGod, he really went and wrote that.‚Äù Or maybe you're rolling your eyes. Fair enough.

Either way, I‚Äôm here. Trying. Hoping. Ready.

1labkou,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1labkou/some_steps_to_know_if_your_unpopular_opinion_is/,Some steps to know if your UNPOPULAR opinion is indeed UNPOPULAR,"**Steps**

1. **YOUR Unpopular Opinion is a direct opposite of the currently accepted truth or norm (THE POPULAR OPINION)**
   * **YOUR Unpopular Opinion**: Hindi magaling kumanta si Ed Sheeran
   * **Popular Opinion:** Magaling kumanta si Ed Sheeran
   * **This is a valid unpopular opinion** because the popular opinion is something that the majority accepts as true, thus yours is the unpopular one.
2. **YOUR Unpopular Opinion's direct opposite is well-known by the average joes**
   * **YOUR Unpopular Opinion**: Pangit ang kapitbahay ko na si (INSERT NAME OF KAPITBAHAY HERE)
   * **Popular Opinion:** Pogi ang kapitbahay ko na si (INSERT NAME OF KAPITBAHAY HERE)
   * **This is NOT a valid unpopular opinion** because no one even knows who your kapitbahay is. No one would even care if someone would agree or disagree sa sinasabi mo. The antithesis of your UNPOPULAR OPINION , THE POPULAR ONE, should hold true for the general populace, but because both the popular and unpopular opinion are unknown and only specific sa iyo, hindi sya valid.
3. **YOUR Unpopular Opinion** should actually be the UNPOPULAR ONE
   * **YOUR Unpopular Opinion**: [Unpopular Opinion: Matcha actually taste good!](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1l8j9nc/unpopular_opinion_matcha_actually_taste_good/)
   * **(REAL) Popular Opinion:** Masarap ang Matcha
   * **This is NOT a valid unpopular opinion** because your unpopular opinion is actually the popular one. Matcha is a multi billion  dollar global industry, coffee, ice cream, candy, tea, etc, is well known in a global scale.
4. **YOUR Unpopular Opinion** shouldnt be a rant
   * **YOUR Unpopular Opinion**: [Netflix's new UI SUCK!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1l4lmiw/unpopular_opinion_netflixs_new_ui_suck/)
   * **This is NOT a valid unpopular opinion** this is obviously a rant rather than an unpopular opinion.

**Additional Reminders**

1. Unpopular opinion(s) should be upvoted in this sub, yun yung essence ng sub na ito, [not the other way around](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1l5fxhs/comment/mwgjyo5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
2. Check the subreddit if your so called unpopular opinion hasn't been said already by n-other schmucks who thinks the opinion is unpopular. (RULE NO. 3) (by [u/Jaded-Throat-211](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jaded-Throat-211/))
3. **DO NOT ATTACK MEMBERS FOR STATING AN UNPOPULAR OPINION**! This is¬†[r/unpopularopinionph](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/), expect to see opinions that may be uncomfortable, unpopular, or go against the norm, yan ang point ng sub nato!

A few weeks ago, my girlfriend went on a work trip and had coffee with a guy she was working with. Later on, he invited her to dinner, and she told him she‚Äôd only come if the whole team was going. The team did go, but the guy still kept talking to her and even asked her what her type was. She told him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm engaged, my fianc√© is my type.‚Äù We‚Äôre not actually engaged  I‚Äôm her boyfriend  but she used that to make it clear she wasn‚Äôt interested.

She told me everything honestly, without me having to ask. I had some mixed feelings about the coffee part, but I appreciated her honesty and how she handled it. We talked through it and moved on.

Last night, we were on a video call, just joking around. She said something like, ‚ÄúYou should buy me a house,‚Äù jokingly and I stupidly replied, ‚ÄúIs that why you were roaming around with the civil engineer dude?‚Äù It was meant as a sarcastic joke, not serious at all, but she got really upset. She told me not to talk to her and that she‚Äôd talk to me later.

I apologized right away. I told her it was dumb, I didn‚Äôt mean anything by it, and I definitely wasn‚Äôt trying to question her character. I said I trust her and I respect how she handled that situation. But she‚Äôs still not responding and says she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it.

Message as follows:
Him - hey how are you going, wanna catch up for a coffee? (juice for me)
Me - Hi, it‚Äôs nice to hear from you. I have been good, how about yourself? 
Him - i‚Äôm good would you like to go for lunch or coffee or not really 
Me - Yea that sounds good. 
Him - when are you free i know it‚Äôs exam period so if you don‚Äôt want to i get it :)

I then gave him a quick call and just asked what his intentions were and he said it‚Äôs been 3 weeks since I saw you and I wanted to see how you were doing. I just mentioned that if he is worried about me he doesn‚Äôt need to be as I have amazing people around (I really struggled at the start and he was aware of this) he said that‚Äôs not why and then he was like I thought we said we could be friends. Then he said he was free this weekend if we want to catch up.

We have been broken up for two months so I am not sure why he would think now is the time to be friends (obviously far too soon). Also I am not sure if he actually wants to be friends - I‚Äôm not too sure of his true intentions if that makes sense. When we talked about being friends when we just broke up we both kind of agreed it‚Äôs pretty unlikely that will happen so I‚Äôm very confused. 

I miss him and want him back but I also don‚Äôt want to to destroy all my progress. 

How do I handle this from here? I think I want to see him but I don‚Äôt know when I should (is this weekend too soon?) or because I want him back should I not see him. 

When I meet him I am not going to do anything like begging or say I miss him or anything like that I‚Äôll just engage in the catch up and then I can kind of gauge from there. I did all this when we just broke up and he shut me down.

We were almost a month NC. Just don‚Äôt know what to do, if I should see him or whether I‚Äôm just setting myself up for disappointment.

1lab6pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1lab6pa/34m_seeking_the_fervent_curious_and_authentic/,"[34/M] - Seeking the fervent, curious, and authentic","Hello!

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation. Dazzle me with your own signal, and let's see where the tides and winds take us.",3,1749805243.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs full of potholes, the surface is completely uneven, and it‚Äôs just not safe, especially if you‚Äôre on a two-wheeler.

What makes it worse is that this isn‚Äôt some side road ‚Äî it‚Äôs a proper bus route. I‚Äôve seen KSRTC buses literally jumping over the potholes. And every morning, a bunch of school buses from different schools take this road to pick up kids. It‚Äôs a busy stretch and people use it constantly.

There‚Äôs always some kind of digging or pipeline work going on, but nothing ever seems to actually get fixed.

Does anyone know what the deal is with this road and why nothing‚Äôs ever done about it?",1,1749804657.0,Trivandrum,2,1.0,False
1lab14r,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1lab14r/is_the_hospitality_in_germany_all_shit/,Is the hospitality in Germany all shit?,"We moved from China to Germany just two weeks ago. I love the architectures and green areas in the city (many many parks), the dog friendly environment, and even the weather (not as bad as we expected).

What surprised me is the hospitality here. 

I understand most stores are closed on Sundays but some bakeries/cafes remain open for the neighborhood. It‚Äôs busy but not like Shanghai or NY busy. The owner seems she cant handle this little tiny bit of stress when customers waiting in line. So she yelled in German at me while I was the only customer remained in line for take away that ‚Äúthey are busy and cannot serve‚Äù. Huh?! I don‚Äôt mind waiting tho and I‚Äôm patient ‚Ä¶.


Another example is when I was on a trip in Heimsheim with my husband (he‚Äôs assigned there for a biz trip), the little inn there is horrible in greeting their customers. We came a day later than when we booked it for (basically we paid for an extra day without staying). That confused her so much and the more confused she was, the faster she spoke, even after we showed her our booking confirmation. And when I was told to check out by 10am, which I did. I asked if I can sit in the little lobby to wait till my husband finishes work‚Äî-> nope, outside only. Then I asked if I can buy a coffee, no! ‚Äî‚Äî>> you don‚Äôt want to make some money? Or even as a gesture from the host? Although they have room service avail. 


I‚Äôm a Hospitality mgmt major, worked both in the US and China. I don‚Äôt understand this mentality, the basic human interaction out of empathy and respect. Especially for people in hospitality industry. 

Is this the norm in Germany ? ",0,1749804586.0,germany,58,0.42,False
1lab0ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/novellovers/comments/1lab0ov/where_can_i_find_this_novel_or_the_name_of_it/,Where can I find this novel or the name of it?,"Ever since we were kids, I, like everyone else in the pack, had harbored a crush on the future Alpha. But not everyone's feelings matched the depth of mine.

We barely exchanged words‚Äîjust that one accidental collision‚Äîand yet, he never seemed to notice me, even though I couldn't help but stare at him endlessly. He consumed my thoughts like a wildfire. Maybe it was obsessive, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't stop daydreaming about him.

Sure, I might have been pretty, but no one ever mentioned it. I liked school, had friends, but I was never remarkable. Not like his stunning, naturally blonde, statuesque girlfriend who held everyone's gaze for most of high school. She knew exactly how to captivate a room.

That all changed the summer after I turned eighteen, right after graduation.

On the morning of my birthday, before my parents woke up to begin our tradition of making far too many pancakes and binge-watching movies to recover from the late-night celebrations, I decided to take a walk past the training grounds.

Then I caught a scent‚Äîsomething mouthwatering, but also soothing, almost hypnotic. It reminded me of the woods after a fresh rain, even though the sky was clear and had been for days.

There, blocking my path, stood Noah‚Äîthe future Alpha. My throat went dry. His dark brown hair clung to his forehead in damp strands, and his matching brown eyes shimmered, flickering to an intense midnight black.

""Mine,"" he growled low and possessive.

Suddenly, a storm of butterflies erupted inside me; my entire body buzzed, rooted in stunned disbelief.

I couldn't believe it. Everything I'd ever dreamed of, every secret fantasy I'd never dared speak aloud, was happening right then.

That day, he claimed me‚Äîcompletely and irrevocably. From that moment on, my world orbited him even more than before.

It's been over a year now, and I still can't fully grasp that he's mine‚Äîonly mine. Things aren't perfect. We're both scrambling to master the roles we're about to inherit in just a few months, when he officially steps into his position as Alpha at twenty-one. When that happens, I'll stand proudly by his side as his Luna.

Still, it sometimes feels unreal. I look at him the same way I did in the cafeteria‚Äîfilled with longing and desire‚Äîthe difference now is he meets my gaze with the same intensity.

""Switch the forks. You know this, Wren."" Naomi, the current Luna and Noah's mother, chided me sharply.

My lessons in becoming a Luna mostly involved planning parties, memorizing the names and faces of influential members from other packs, learning to balance warmth with stoicism, and daydreaming about Noah.

Honestly, I struggled with everything except the last. All the beige shades looked identical to me; I wasn't even sure there was more than one color of peach.

""Sorry, Luna,"" I muttered, catching Naomi's stern glare. No mumbling allowed.

""Luna, Wren."" Jason, Noah's future Gamma, entered the room. ""Claire's here and wants to see you.""

""Wonderful,"" Naomi said with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. My stomach sank. Claire‚ÄîNoah's high school girlfriend? She was supposed to be at college.

""You can finish the setup, right?"" Naomi asked me. I nodded.

""Of course, Luna."" I smiled, though my heart twisted with curiosity and, probably, misplaced dread.

""I'll help,"" Jason offered, grabbing the tray of silverware from Naomi.

""Thanks,"" I whispered as she left the room.

""This is torture,"" he joked.

""I couldn't agree more,"" I replied.

""I'd rather have back-to-back training than sit through another Luna lesson.""

Although I wasn't a regular in training sessions, I sometimes joined in. But after mating with Noah and becoming his future Luna, I was required to stop completely.

""Wren, someone I want you to meet."" Naomi appeared at the door.

Moments later, Claire herself strolled in.

Her gaze flicked over the place settings before landing on me.

Chapter 2

""Jason."" Claire's lips curved into a dazzling smile, flashing pearly white teeth. Her naturally blonde hair was perfectly curled, and she stood tall and confident in a sleek red dress that looked better suited for a party than this formal gathering. Black stilettos accentuated her long, golden legs.

""Nice to see you; it's been too long,"" Jason returned the smile, glancing between us. ""How's college?""

""Fine."" She waved her manicured hand dismissively. ""But Costo Valley is so boring. There's hardly anything to do.""

Costo Valley rang a faint bell, but I couldn't place why.

""Claire, I don't think you've met Wren formally yet‚ÄîNoah's mate,"" Jason said, making the introduction I'd been waiting for from Naomi. Claire's bright smile faltered briefly, replaced by a tight-lipped expression as she appraised me.

I tucked some wavy black hair behind my ear, forcing myself to hold her gaze and not stare down at the simple white cotton dress I wore. Suddenly, I felt painfully underdressed in my own home.

""No, we haven't."" Claire extended her hand but didn't move closer.

I closed the gap and shook it firmly. ""It's a pleasure."" I forced a polite smile. ""Noah and I are honored by your visit. I hope you're staying for his birthday?"" I kept my tone calm, despite the urge to claw at her perfectly lined eyes for reasons I didn't understand.

His 21st birthday party was only days away, and I'd poured myself into every detail of its planning. I wanted her to see I was competent, even if I didn't look as stunning in a mini skirt. But what was I really trying to prove? My skills in party planning? Even thinking about it felt dull.

""Of course,"" she replied smoothly. My stomach twisted into knots‚Äîbut wasn't that the answer I was hoping for?

""I look forward to getting to know you better."" I held my ground, smiling steadily.

""Likewise."" Her smile was cold, devoid of warmth. ""Wren, is it?""

I nodded.

""I think your soup and dessert spoons are swapped,"" Claire remarked, eyes flicking to the table.

""So they are,"" Naomi tutted, stepping in. ""Thanks for pointing that out, Claire.""

She ushered Claire out, their heads close together as they whispered and laughed.

I sank into a chair, groaning.

""Very un-Luna of you,"" Jason teased. ""But your act was impressive.""

I glared at him. ""Was it that obvious?""

""Yeah."" He shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck, that telltale sign of trying to soften the blow.

Jason and Isaac‚Äîthe future Beta‚Äîhad become my friends over the past year, but I'd developed a particular fondness for Jason almost immediately. I was surprised at how accepting they were. I wasn't like the usual girls they hung out with. But in the last year, as future pack leaders, we'd done almost everything together, living in the packhouse.

I moved in the night after Noah marked and mated me. The memory still sent shivers of pleasure down my spine. I was overwhelmed with disbelief that the man I'd dreamed of most of my life was finally claiming me‚Äîexploring my body with his tongue and hands, then‚Äî

""Wren?"" Jason's voice pulled me from my reverie.

""Hm?""

""I asked if you wanted anything else after we swap the spoons."" I shook my head and bit my lip, holding back questions about Claire.

Thinking about her made my stomach drop, a sharp pain like my lungs had been emptied of air and filled with lead. I knew my jealousy was irrational. Their relationship had ended long before I found out I was Noah's mate. I didn't steal him from her. Even if I did, I was his mate now; she was just an ex.

""Are you okay?"" Jason's expression was filled with concern.

""Yeah, of course."" I tried to breathe through the ache.

""Don't worry about Claire. She acts like that around new people.""

""Sure."" I tried to dismiss it. ""I'm going to find Noah."" I pushed myself up despite the jealousy simmering inside me.

I hurried through the hall, hoping to catch my mate in his father's office‚ÄîAlpha Harvey's office‚Äîbefore he dashed off to his next commitment.

The last few weeks had been a whirlwind, between his birthday and our impending takeover of the pack leadership. We barely saw each other.

I knew seeing him, feeling his touch, would ease this firestorm inside me, this frantic, heated sensation that flooded my body like glowing embers. I'd felt it before‚Äînot jealousy but stress when Noah was away. I guess it was normal for mates to react so viscerally to each other's absence.

Then I remembered where I'd heard of Costo Valley before‚ÄîNoah had a conference there a month ago, in a park I couldn't recall the name of. Or maybe he hadn't told me. I really needed to get better at remembering all these details.

I rounded the corner toward the heavy, dark wooden door of his father's office, soon to be his. Suddenly, I heard noises from behind it‚Äîa thumping sound, a growl, a sharp moan, and muffled voices, as if stifled.

I blushed, startled. Alpha Harvey and Luna Naomi weren't overly affectionate in public, but they were destined mates. It was natural.

I quietly turned away, wanting to give them privacy.

""Noah, Noah."" The soft moan came again, replaced by heavy, muffled panting.

I froze, every nerve ending alive with electricity. A cold sweat coated my skin as dread settled in my gut. I must have misheard.

I reached out with trembling hands for the doorknob‚Äîit was unlocked, which made my stomach twist. Did I really want to see this?

I cracked the door open just enough to confirm nothing was amiss.

But Noah stood there, his back to me.

I knew every contour of his body, how his muscles flexed and tensed when he was‚Äîwhen he was‚Äîdeep inside me.

Long, golden legs still wrapped around his waist, black stilettos dangling from them.

""Fuck,"" he grunted‚Äîa clear sign he was close.

He was moments away from finishing with Claire.

Chapter 3

I was utterly lost on what to do next. Every instinct screamed at me to run away and shout until my voice broke, yet my body refused to obey. Would confronting them in that very moment be better‚Äîor only make everything worse? I longed to hear him justify how he could betray me like this.

I wanted him to feel the weight of guilt, hoping it might dull my burning anger. I needed him to experience regret so that the sharp sting of betrayal might lessen. An explanation was all I craved‚Äîto somehow wash away the shock and the aching pain consuming me.

Before I could even gather my thoughts, he turned around, pulling his pants up‚Äîand saw me standing there.

They both did.

He froze in place, calling out my name, while she simply offered me a lazy, smug smile.

And then, I ran.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

‚ÄúWren, damn it, Wren.‚Äù

He chased me as I slammed the bedroom door shut, diving beneath the covers, desperate to hide.

‚ÄúWren.‚Äù He threw the door wide open just as tears streamed down my face.

I couldn‚Äôt think clearly. I couldn‚Äôt begin to process what I was feeling. All I could do was feel‚Äîand every emotion I had was wrong, twisted, unbearable.

The mattress shifted as he sat beside me, his hand resting gently on my back.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI,‚Äù he stammered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù

I waited, aching for him to continue. As much as I wanted to scream and rage, part of me desperately wanted him to beg for my forgiveness. I needed his words‚Äîsome kind of explanation to make this nightmare okay.

After a few silent moments, the warm weight of his hand slipped away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you when you calm down,‚Äù he sighed, and I felt the bed move as he got up.

Was he really going to leave me?

The creak of the door opening and closing answered that question for me.

The hollow emptiness inside my chest tore even wider, making it impossible to breathe.

But he never returned.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

I don‚Äôt know when sleep claimed me, but when I awoke, he was lying beside me in bed. Relief washed over me in a sudden rush‚Äîthough I wasn‚Äôt sure why.

I curled into the broad warmth of his back, letting the steady heat of his body lull me back toward the abyss I had fallen into.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

He rose before I did, the dull ache in my chest threatening to split me apart again.

But he had come back. For me.

I slipped into the shower, running a brush through my tangled hair. My pale green eyes looked unusually bright, stark against the red rims from crying.

I grimaced at my reflection‚Äîthere was no hiding the devastation I‚Äôd endured all day and night.

Following the faint murmur of voices, I paused at the breakfast room door‚Äîand my stomach dropped.

I hurried past the open doorway, praying no one would notice me.

‚ÄúWren, honey?‚Äù The voice stopped me dead in my tracks as I clenched and unclenched my fists.

I lingered just inside the frame, unwilling to sit with that bitch.

Luna Naomi and Claire appeared completely at ease, sharing a relaxed breakfast together.

It was just the two of them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt join you.‚Äù I forced a smile, hoping it passed as genuine. ‚ÄúI have‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, your appointment, yes,‚Äù Luna Natalia replied warmly.

I actually had forgotten about that doctor‚Äôs visit.

I nodded and turned without glancing at Claire. I knew looking at her would unleash a tidal wave of rage.

How dare she sit here in my home after what she did with my mate?

My mind was consumed by fury as I made my way to the pack clinic.

Suddenly, two strong hands wrapped around me, momentarily stunning me before his familiar scent surrounded me.

‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù He pulled me into an empty room and locked the door behind us.

I couldn‚Äôt stop trembling. Hot tears welled up in my eyes.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I demanded before he could speak.

I shook my head, letting tears pour freely down my face‚Äîdeliberately refusing to wipe them away. I wanted him to see the damage he had done.

‚ÄúI, uh,‚Äù he said, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. He was usually quick with words, but now he seemed lost. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt have happened like that. It shouldn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm so sorry. You don‚Äôt deserve any of this.‚Äù His deep chocolate eyes pinned me where I stood.

Despite myself, my stomach flipped.

‚ÄúI want her gone,‚Äù I insisted.

Chapter 4

‚ÄúWren,‚Äù he breathed, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can. She can come to your party, but she‚Äôs not allowed to stay here.‚Äù I summoned the Luna tone I had been practicing‚Äîa voice of authority and steel. I assumed that was why she was here this morning‚Äîstaying in a guest room at the pack house.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He lowered his head, then leaned down to press his mouth to mine.

His lips barely brushed against mine, and my breath caught, a surge of desire rushing through me. His kiss was restrained but hungry, and he drew me closer.

I was engulfed by the spark and warmth of our mate bond. In his arms, I felt loose and free. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he kissed me like this outside of our intimate moments‚Äîif it had ever happened at all.

He pulled away, and I raised a hand to my swollen lips, dizzy from the effect he still had on me.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I whispered.

He ran a hand through his dark hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt even know. With everything happening‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel like myself.‚Äù

Not exactly an explanation, but I wanted to believe him.

Wren, are you still coming to your appointment? The doctor‚Äôs voice came through our mind link.

‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù I paused, studying him. ‚ÄúTo an appointment. We can talk later.‚Äù

He nodded, tucking a stray lock of hair behind my ear, and I melted under his touch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äîthat wasn‚Äôt fair to you,‚Äù he murmured.

I nodded, fighting back tears that once again sprang to my eyes.

‚ÄúI forgive you.‚Äù

The words felt strange as they left my lips. I wasn‚Äôt sure he even deserved forgiveness yet. I wanted more groveling from him‚Äîbut more than that, I didn‚Äôt want to lose him.

My lifelong love, the mate destined to be mine.

This was just a mistake we would overcome. It would make us stronger, intensifying our love.

I could endure the pain‚Äîthere was no other choice.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

‚ÄúWell, Luna.‚Äù The middle-aged doctor who always seemed bubbly and full of life sat across from me at her desk. ‚ÄúEr, Wren. Sorry,‚Äù she corrected herself with a smile.

I liked the title‚Äîit filled me with pride. To serve and protect the pack I loved, the one I grew up in alongside the man I had always loved but never thought I could have.

The title felt like a bond I hadn‚Äôt realized I needed‚Ä¶ until yesterday.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Dr. Lily,‚Äù I said, smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to get used to it soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery soon.‚Äù Her eyes sparkled as she flipped through my charts.

They widened slightly, then the smile returned. ‚ÄúVery soon, you‚Äôll be called something else.‚Äù

My brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations, Luna. You‚Äôre going to be a mother.‚Äù

I froze in place, letting the words sink in.

Looking down at my stomach, I laughed‚Äîa laugh of disbelief and joy.

We wanted this. I wanted this. And now it was happening.

A baby. We were going to have a baby.

I rubbed my stomach gently.

There was a life growing inside me.

Tears pricked my eyes, but now for a different reason.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The doctor‚Äôs smile grew. ‚ÄúJust a few weeks along. I‚Äôd say about five or six weeks‚Äîthat‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt show last time you were here. It must have happened just days ago. I want you to come back next week so we can do a proper scan, maybe with Noah. Okay?‚Äù

I nodded, unable to stop smiling even though my cheeks ached.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Joy flooded through me.

Everything felt right again. Better than right.

Perfect.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

After leaving the clinic, I clutched the papers confirming my pregnancy close to my heart.

I wanted nothing more than to tell him‚Äîit would be the perfect birthday present.

Though his birthday was tomorrow, the party was tonight‚ÄîI figured it was close enough.

When I walked into the packhouse, the atmosphere was completely different than when I left.

The air was charged with energy, and people bustled about. Omegas darted around with vases and platters of food, careful not to drop a single thing.

I didn‚Äôt understand. Everything had been set weeks ago. Decisions had already been made.

Luna Naomi nearly collided with me‚Äîor maybe I almost bumped into her.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Her eyes widened as she saw me. I shoved the papers into my pocket.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a change. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù

Her words caught me off guard.

She seemed genuinely pleased to take charge herself, saying it took her far less time than when I was involved.

‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù I asked with a genuine smile. I was happy she needed me.

‚ÄúI told the omegas to redo the table settings in the dining hall. They‚Äôre cleaning it again now, but I need you to supervise them, make sure they‚Äôre doing it perfectly.‚Äù She handed me a clipboard and tapped the attached color swatches.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre changing everything?‚Äù

I looked down at the swatches‚Äîthey were completely different from what we‚Äôd finalized weeks ago.

‚ÄúYes. The prince is coming.‚Äù She waved her hand dismissively.

I fought back a laugh. A prince?

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you not been paying attention in your studies, Wrenia?‚Äù Her brown eyes locked on mine.

I flinched inwardly at the use of my full name.

‚ÄúI have. And the royal family stopped holding power a century ago,‚Äù I countered.

She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose like I was giving her a headache.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt hold power really, yes. But he is the leader of our territory; he represents us. They are still powerful‚Äînaturally‚Äîand we respect them and their bloodline,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAlpha Darius, the prince, has told us he‚Äôll attend this evening. I‚Äôve met him once. Of course, he‚Äôs invited to all our pack events, but usually he declines or sends a representative.‚Äù

I nodded but still didn‚Äôt understand. If he didn‚Äôt truly have power over us, why all the fuss‚Äîand, oh God, the fancy china I definitely shattered last time.

‚ÄúIf you have any questions, link me. This has to be perfect.‚Äù She turned and walked away, her heels clicking sharply on the floor.

I sighed, reviewing all the changes. At least I wouldn‚Äôt have to set out the silverware‚Äîjust oversee the process.

This would help keep my mind off the memory of Claire‚Äôs toned legs wrapped around my mate.

Anger flared again. That was in the past. The recent past, but still past.

I would focus on the future.

I patted my pocket, feeling the confirmation from the doctor.

The future‚Äîand this baby‚Äîwere all that mattered now.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

The afternoon dragged on but was over before I knew it.

Dusk settled beyond the tall dining room windows, and I yawned, silently cursing myself for not asking if I was allowed coffee.

I‚Äôd seen it a lot in movies, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how it affected us wolves.

‚ÄúWren, what are you still doing here?‚Äù Luna Natalia slipped inside, her hair and makeup perfect for the evening, though she hadn‚Äôt changed yet.

‚ÄúI was just finishing up. We only have a few more centerpieces for the smaller tables.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle that. Go get ready. It‚Äôs about to start.‚Äù She grabbed the clipboard from my hand, and I let her.

If I left before it was done, I knew I‚Äôd get in trouble.

No matter what I did, it was always wrong‚Äîand I‚Äôd come to accept that.

I would be Luna in a few months, and I hoped the hold she had on me would lessen.

Significantly.

I hoped.

Chapter 5

After a quick shower, I stepped into the sleek, silver gown that clung to my curves like it was tailored just for me. The color‚ÄîNoah‚Äôs favorite‚Äîhad been a point of debate in my mind all afternoon. I‚Äôd kept a few other dresses from the collection Luna Naomi had sent over for this occasion, but ultimately, I wanted to be seen tonight. The gown featured delicate straps and a plunging back, leaving me exposed in ways I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable with. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was dressing for the woman I was‚Äîor the one I was trying to become.

A soft knock echoed against the door, and my heart jumped as I reached for the sleek black gift box resting on the vanity‚Äîthe one holding the pregnancy test results.

‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù asked a voice I knew even better than Noah‚Äôs. I opened the door to find my mother standing there.

‚ÄúOh, Wren,‚Äù she breathed, her eyes sweeping over me. ‚ÄúYou look breathtaking.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on in.‚Äù I stepped aside with a smile.

‚ÄúI figured you might need a hand, with Leah out of town and all.‚Äù She gestured toward the vanity, and I nodded, settling into the chair.

Leah had been my closest confidante since middle school, the kind of best friend who felt more like a sister. Every summer, her family took an extended vacation, and though I missed her tonight more than I cared to admit, I understood how much those trips meant to her. She‚Äôd be back in a few weeks, and I‚Äôd have plenty to tell her when she returned. I glanced down at my stomach, unable to keep from smiling.

But Noah would be the first to know. Even before Mom. The urge to shout it from the rooftops was suffocating.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I murmured as my mom began curling sections of my hair. I stayed as still as I could, trying to steady my hand while I lined my eyes and dabbed on shimmering eyeshadow that matched the silver of my dress. I wasn‚Äôt half as good at it as Leah, but tonight wasn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit was about Noah. And I doubted anyone would even glance at my makeup once they saw the way I looked for him.

‚ÄúThere we go,‚Äù she said, brushing out the curls until they settled in soft waves. My hair had a bit of a natural bend to it, but her touch gave it elegance.

‚ÄúOne last thing.‚Äù She opened a velvet box she‚Äôd brought with her. ‚ÄúI know tonight is about Noah, but you‚Äôre on the verge of becoming Luna. Your father and I‚Ä¶ we couldn‚Äôt be prouder.‚Äù

She took out a delicate white gold hair comb, sparkling with tiny diamonds and deep blue sapphires.

‚ÄúGrandma‚Äôs?‚Äù I asked, reaching out to touch it, my hand pausing midair.

She nodded. ‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

I watched in the mirror as she pinned back a section of my curls, tucking the heirloom into place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely radiant,‚Äù she whispered, resting her head on my shoulder before pressing a kiss to my temple.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, leaning into the warmth of her affection.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs not be late. The mate of the guest of honor can‚Äôt exactly arrive after things have started,‚Äù she teased, slipping seamlessly into her Luna voice.

I grabbed a sheer shawl from the closet and draped it over my bare arms and back. It made the dress feel a bit more modest, a bit more like me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in there,‚Äù she said, heading off toward the grand dining hall. I, on the other hand, made my way to meet Noah and his parents in his father‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stunning,‚Äù Noah said as he curled my hand around his arm. ‚ÄúBut maybe showing a bit too much skin for a Luna-to-be.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a compliment‚Äînot really. More like a reprimand, dressed up in a whisper.

‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, not even sure what I thought. That I looked the part? That he‚Äôd appreciate me putting in the effort for him? I felt foolish now.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fine line between classy and slutty,‚Äù he murmured, brushing his lips against my ear. I shivered from the contact, doing my best to drown the sting of his words in the warmth of his touch.

Together, we entered the dining hall, flanked by his parents. The room stood to greet the future Alpha with a round of applause.

Despite everything, I felt a surge of pride walking in beside him. We glided between the tables until we reached the long table reserved for ranked members and honored guests.

I moved to sit at his right, like I always had.

‚ÄúShift over one,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù My seat had never changed.

‚ÄúThe prince is joining us,‚Äù he said coolly, pulling the chair out so I could move.

I stood, sliding into the next seat without protest. I reached for a flute of champagne out of habit but stopped short. I wasn‚Äôt drinking tonight‚Äînot with our baby growing inside me.

The speeches began, but the seat between us remained empty. He didn‚Äôt motion for me to return, didn‚Äôt offer a smile or a glance.

I drifted into my thoughts, only snapping out of it when Luna Naomi gave me a pointed look and whispered my name.

Right. I stood just as the prince took the chair between us. He glanced my way, and I nodded politely before looking past him to Noah.

That‚Äôs when Claire entered.

Chapter 6

The man beside me may have said something, but I didn‚Äôt hear a word. My entire focus narrowed on Claire as she strode toward the table, her body hugged tight in a strapless black dress that flared dramatically with each step. Her lips were painted in a bold, blood-red hue, and her confidence was a spectacle all on its own.

She greeted the man next to me with a sugary smile before directing a gleaming grin my way‚Äîher teeth bright, fake, and far too perfect. I returned a smirk disguised as a smile, thinking of what was hidden inside the little black box. That news would strip the grin off her face in an instant.

‚ÄúThe future Luna looks exquisite,‚Äù the man said, nodding after Claire.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not the future Luna,‚Äù I said, my voice tight as I clenched my fork.

‚ÄúOh‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù I snapped, fixing him with a glare. His pale blue eyes blinked in surprise, then softened as he looked at me more carefully.

‚ÄúI meant no offense.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. My attention was glued to Claire as she leaned across the table and whispered something in Noah‚Äôs ear. His eyes widened briefly before a slow smile crept across his lips.

What the hell was that? He knew exactly how this would look, how it would make me feel. My hand twitched toward the mind-link, ready to confront him, when the man beside me broke the silence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always hated events like these. Too formal. Too fake.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you prefer instead?‚Äù I asked, eyes still locked on Noah.

‚ÄúSomething small. Something real. Just the people who actually matter.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúNow that sounds like heaven. But not exactly on-brand for ranked members and their obsession with appearances. The Lunas would probably collapse from sheer boredom.‚Äù

He let out a laugh‚Äîa real one, loud and warm. It drew Noah‚Äôs attention, along with his parents‚Äô.

I smiled at them like nothing was wrong.

Claire finally stopped parading at the head of the table, only to loop around and settle in beside Noah. People literally shifted their seats so he could make room for her.

Anger surged through me like a wave crashing against the shore. The audacity of it. Of her. Of him.

What the hell was he thinking? Maybe he was just being polite. Maybe. But this? This crossed the line.

The man next to me eventually excused himself, offering polite apologies to Noah and his parents.

Most of the other guests filtered out soon after, leaving behind only the ranked members and a few stragglers‚Äîmy parents among them.

Claire leaned in close to Noah, smiling at him like they shared some inside joke. Every fiber of me wanted to slap that smile off her face.

But instead, I handed him the gift.

‚ÄúI wanted to give this to you earlier, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off with a shrug, biting my lip.

He took the box, curiosity flickering across his face as he opened it and pulled out the slip of paper.

My stomach twisted with nerves and joy, butterflies swarming as I waited for his reaction.

This was something we‚Äôd both longed for. And now, here it was‚Äîproof of a baby. The Moon Goddess herself had timed it perfectly. A child to carry on the Alpha line, arriving just months before our official ascension.

‚ÄúWren?‚Äù His voice caught, and for a second, I saw emotion flash in his eyes‚Äîsomething like hurt‚Äîbefore his face hardened.

‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd told me in private,‚Äù he said, jaw clenched.

The excitement in my chest began to crumble. What did it matter if no one else knew yet? He hadn‚Äôt even made an announcement.

Then he stood.

‚ÄúI, Noah Henderson, future Alpha of the Azure Hollow Pack, reject you, Wrenia Barnes, as my mate and future Luna.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand the words.

But my body did.

Pain burst through me like a wildfire, our bond tearing apart at the seams. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt move. It was as if my blood had been replaced with fire.

This wasn‚Äôt heartbreak.

This was death.

(Wren and Noah),"Ever since we were kids, I, like everyone else in the pack, had harbored a crush on the future Alpha. But not everyone's feelings matched the depth of mine.

We barely exchanged words‚Äîjust that one accidental collision‚Äîand yet, he never seemed to notice me, even though I couldn't help but stare at him endlessly. He consumed my thoughts like a wildfire. Maybe it was obsessive, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't stop daydreaming about him.

Sure, I might have been pretty, but no one ever mentioned it. I liked school, had friends, but I was never remarkable. Not like his stunning, naturally blonde, statuesque girlfriend who held everyone's gaze for most of high school. She knew exactly how to captivate a room.

That all changed the summer after I turned eighteen, right after graduation.

On the morning of my birthday, before my parents woke up to begin our tradition of making far too many pancakes and binge-watching movies to recover from the late-night celebrations, I decided to take a walk past the training grounds.

Then I caught a scent‚Äîsomething mouthwatering, but also soothing, almost hypnotic. It reminded me of the woods after a fresh rain, even though the sky was clear and had been for days.

There, blocking my path, stood Noah‚Äîthe future Alpha. My throat went dry. His dark brown hair clung to his forehead in damp strands, and his matching brown eyes shimmered, flickering to an intense midnight black.

""Mine,"" he growled low and possessive.

Suddenly, a storm of butterflies erupted inside me; my entire body buzzed, rooted in stunned disbelief.

I couldn't believe it. Everything I'd ever dreamed of, every secret fantasy I'd never dared speak aloud, was happening right then.

That day, he claimed me‚Äîcompletely and irrevocably. From that moment on, my world orbited him even more than before.

It's been over a year now, and I still can't fully grasp that he's mine‚Äîonly mine. Things aren't perfect. We're both scrambling to master the roles we're about to inherit in just a few months, when he officially steps into his position as Alpha at twenty-one. When that happens, I'll stand proudly by his side as his Luna.

Still, it sometimes feels unreal. I look at him the same way I did in the cafeteria‚Äîfilled with longing and desire‚Äîthe difference now is he meets my gaze with the same intensity.

""Switch the forks. You know this, Wren."" Naomi, the current Luna and Noah's mother, chided me sharply.

My lessons in becoming a Luna mostly involved planning parties, memorizing the names and faces of influential members from other packs, learning to balance warmth with stoicism, and daydreaming about Noah.

Honestly, I struggled with everything except the last. All the beige shades looked identical to me; I wasn't even sure there was more than one color of peach.

""Sorry, Luna,"" I muttered, catching Naomi's stern glare. No mumbling allowed.

""Luna, Wren."" Jason, Noah's future Gamma, entered the room. ""Claire's here and wants to see you.""

""Wonderful,"" Naomi said with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. My stomach sank. Claire‚ÄîNoah's high school girlfriend? She was supposed to be at college.

""You can finish the setup, right?"" Naomi asked me. I nodded.

""Of course, Luna."" I smiled, though my heart twisted with curiosity and, probably, misplaced dread.

""I'll help,"" Jason offered, grabbing the tray of silverware from Naomi.

""Thanks,"" I whispered as she left the room.

""This is torture,"" he joked.

""I couldn't agree more,"" I replied.

""I'd rather have back-to-back training than sit through another Luna lesson.""

Although I wasn't a regular in training sessions, I sometimes joined in. But after mating with Noah and becoming his future Luna, I was required to stop completely.

""Wren, someone I want you to meet."" Naomi appeared at the door.

Moments later, Claire herself strolled in.

Her gaze flicked over the place settings before landing on me.

Chapter 2

""Jason."" Claire's lips curved into a dazzling smile, flashing pearly white teeth. Her naturally blonde hair was perfectly curled, and she stood tall and confident in a sleek red dress that looked better suited for a party than this formal gathering. Black stilettos accentuated her long, golden legs.

""Nice to see you; it's been too long,"" Jason returned the smile, glancing between us. ""How's college?""

""Fine."" She waved her manicured hand dismissively. ""But Costo Valley is so boring. There's hardly anything to do.""

Costo Valley rang a faint bell, but I couldn't place why.

""Claire, I don't think you've met Wren formally yet‚ÄîNoah's mate,"" Jason said, making the introduction I'd been waiting for from Naomi. Claire's bright smile faltered briefly, replaced by a tight-lipped expression as she appraised me.

I tucked some wavy black hair behind my ear, forcing myself to hold her gaze and not stare down at the simple white cotton dress I wore. Suddenly, I felt painfully underdressed in my own home.

""No, we haven't."" Claire extended her hand but didn't move closer.

I closed the gap and shook it firmly. ""It's a pleasure."" I forced a polite smile. ""Noah and I are honored by your visit. I hope you're staying for his birthday?"" I kept my tone calm, despite the urge to claw at her perfectly lined eyes for reasons I didn't understand.

His 21st birthday party was only days away, and I'd poured myself into every detail of its planning. I wanted her to see I was competent, even if I didn't look as stunning in a mini skirt. But what was I really trying to prove? My skills in party planning? Even thinking about it felt dull.

""Of course,"" she replied smoothly. My stomach twisted into knots‚Äîbut wasn't that the answer I was hoping for?

""I look forward to getting to know you better."" I held my ground, smiling steadily.

""Likewise."" Her smile was cold, devoid of warmth. ""Wren, is it?""

I nodded.

""I think your soup and dessert spoons are swapped,"" Claire remarked, eyes flicking to the table.

""So they are,"" Naomi tutted, stepping in. ""Thanks for pointing that out, Claire.""

She ushered Claire out, their heads close together as they whispered and laughed.

I sank into a chair, groaning.

""Very un-Luna of you,"" Jason teased. ""But your act was impressive.""

I glared at him. ""Was it that obvious?""

""Yeah."" He shrugged and rubbed the back of his neck, that telltale sign of trying to soften the blow.

Jason and Isaac‚Äîthe future Beta‚Äîhad become my friends over the past year, but I'd developed a particular fondness for Jason almost immediately. I was surprised at how accepting they were. I wasn't like the usual girls they hung out with. But in the last year, as future pack leaders, we'd done almost everything together, living in the packhouse.

I moved in the night after Noah marked and mated me. The memory still sent shivers of pleasure down my spine. I was overwhelmed with disbelief that the man I'd dreamed of most of my life was finally claiming me‚Äîexploring my body with his tongue and hands, then‚Äî

""Wren?"" Jason's voice pulled me from my reverie.

""Hm?""

""I asked if you wanted anything else after we swap the spoons."" I shook my head and bit my lip, holding back questions about Claire.

Thinking about her made my stomach drop, a sharp pain like my lungs had been emptied of air and filled with lead. I knew my jealousy was irrational. Their relationship had ended long before I found out I was Noah's mate. I didn't steal him from her. Even if I did, I was his mate now; she was just an ex.

""Are you okay?"" Jason's expression was filled with concern.

""Yeah, of course."" I tried to breathe through the ache.

""Don't worry about Claire. She acts like that around new people.""

""Sure."" I tried to dismiss it. ""I'm going to find Noah."" I pushed myself up despite the jealousy simmering inside me.

I hurried through the hall, hoping to catch my mate in his father's office‚ÄîAlpha Harvey's office‚Äîbefore he dashed off to his next commitment.

The last few weeks had been a whirlwind, between his birthday and our impending takeover of the pack leadership. We barely saw each other.

I knew seeing him, feeling his touch, would ease this firestorm inside me, this frantic, heated sensation that flooded my body like glowing embers. I'd felt it before‚Äînot jealousy but stress when Noah was away. I guess it was normal for mates to react so viscerally to each other's absence.

Then I remembered where I'd heard of Costo Valley before‚ÄîNoah had a conference there a month ago, in a park I couldn't recall the name of. Or maybe he hadn't told me. I really needed to get better at remembering all these details.

I rounded the corner toward the heavy, dark wooden door of his father's office, soon to be his. Suddenly, I heard noises from behind it‚Äîa thumping sound, a growl, a sharp moan, and muffled voices, as if stifled.

I blushed, startled. Alpha Harvey and Luna Naomi weren't overly affectionate in public, but they were destined mates. It was natural.

I quietly turned away, wanting to give them privacy.

""Noah, Noah."" The soft moan came again, replaced by heavy, muffled panting.

I froze, every nerve ending alive with electricity. A cold sweat coated my skin as dread settled in my gut. I must have misheard.

I reached out with trembling hands for the doorknob‚Äîit was unlocked, which made my stomach twist. Did I really want to see this?

I cracked the door open just enough to confirm nothing was amiss.

But Noah stood there, his back to me.

I knew every contour of his body, how his muscles flexed and tensed when he was‚Äîwhen he was‚Äîdeep inside me.

Long, golden legs still wrapped around his waist, black stilettos dangling from them.

""Fuck,"" he grunted‚Äîa clear sign he was close.

He was moments away from finishing with Claire.

Chapter 3

I was utterly lost on what to do next. Every instinct screamed at me to run away and shout until my voice broke, yet my body refused to obey. Would confronting them in that very moment be better‚Äîor only make everything worse? I longed to hear him justify how he could betray me like this.

I wanted him to feel the weight of guilt, hoping it might dull my burning anger. I needed him to experience regret so that the sharp sting of betrayal might lessen. An explanation was all I craved‚Äîto somehow wash away the shock and the aching pain consuming me.

Before I could even gather my thoughts, he turned around, pulling his pants up‚Äîand saw me standing there.

They both did.

He froze in place, calling out my name, while she simply offered me a lazy, smug smile.

And then, I ran.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

‚ÄúWren, damn it, Wren.‚Äù

He chased me as I slammed the bedroom door shut, diving beneath the covers, desperate to hide.

‚ÄúWren.‚Äù He threw the door wide open just as tears streamed down my face.

I couldn‚Äôt think clearly. I couldn‚Äôt begin to process what I was feeling. All I could do was feel‚Äîand every emotion I had was wrong, twisted, unbearable.

The mattress shifted as he sat beside me, his hand resting gently on my back.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI,‚Äù he stammered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù

I waited, aching for him to continue. As much as I wanted to scream and rage, part of me desperately wanted him to beg for my forgiveness. I needed his words‚Äîsome kind of explanation to make this nightmare okay.

After a few silent moments, the warm weight of his hand slipped away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you when you calm down,‚Äù he sighed, and I felt the bed move as he got up.

Was he really going to leave me?

The creak of the door opening and closing answered that question for me.

The hollow emptiness inside my chest tore even wider, making it impossible to breathe.

But he never returned.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

I don‚Äôt know when sleep claimed me, but when I awoke, he was lying beside me in bed. Relief washed over me in a sudden rush‚Äîthough I wasn‚Äôt sure why.

I curled into the broad warmth of his back, letting the steady heat of his body lull me back toward the abyss I had fallen into.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

He rose before I did, the dull ache in my chest threatening to split me apart again.

But he had come back. For me.

I slipped into the shower, running a brush through my tangled hair. My pale green eyes looked unusually bright, stark against the red rims from crying.

I grimaced at my reflection‚Äîthere was no hiding the devastation I‚Äôd endured all day and night.

Following the faint murmur of voices, I paused at the breakfast room door‚Äîand my stomach dropped.

I hurried past the open doorway, praying no one would notice me.

‚ÄúWren, honey?‚Äù The voice stopped me dead in my tracks as I clenched and unclenched my fists.

I lingered just inside the frame, unwilling to sit with that bitch.

Luna Naomi and Claire appeared completely at ease, sharing a relaxed breakfast together.

It was just the two of them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt join you.‚Äù I forced a smile, hoping it passed as genuine. ‚ÄúI have‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, your appointment, yes,‚Äù Luna Natalia replied warmly.

I actually had forgotten about that doctor‚Äôs visit.

I nodded and turned without glancing at Claire. I knew looking at her would unleash a tidal wave of rage.

How dare she sit here in my home after what she did with my mate?

My mind was consumed by fury as I made my way to the pack clinic.

Suddenly, two strong hands wrapped around me, momentarily stunning me before his familiar scent surrounded me.

‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù He pulled me into an empty room and locked the door behind us.

I couldn‚Äôt stop trembling. Hot tears welled up in my eyes.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I demanded before he could speak.

I shook my head, letting tears pour freely down my face‚Äîdeliberately refusing to wipe them away. I wanted him to see the damage he had done.

‚ÄúI, uh,‚Äù he said, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. He was usually quick with words, but now he seemed lost. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt have happened like that. It shouldn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm so sorry. You don‚Äôt deserve any of this.‚Äù His deep chocolate eyes pinned me where I stood.

Despite myself, my stomach flipped.

‚ÄúI want her gone,‚Äù I insisted.

Chapter 4

‚ÄúWren,‚Äù he breathed, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can. She can come to your party, but she‚Äôs not allowed to stay here.‚Äù I summoned the Luna tone I had been practicing‚Äîa voice of authority and steel. I assumed that was why she was here this morning‚Äîstaying in a guest room at the pack house.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He lowered his head, then leaned down to press his mouth to mine.

His lips barely brushed against mine, and my breath caught, a surge of desire rushing through me. His kiss was restrained but hungry, and he drew me closer.

I was engulfed by the spark and warmth of our mate bond. In his arms, I felt loose and free. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he kissed me like this outside of our intimate moments‚Äîif it had ever happened at all.

He pulled away, and I raised a hand to my swollen lips, dizzy from the effect he still had on me.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù I whispered.

He ran a hand through his dark hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt even know. With everything happening‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel like myself.‚Äù

Not exactly an explanation, but I wanted to believe him.

Wren, are you still coming to your appointment? The doctor‚Äôs voice came through our mind link.

‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù I paused, studying him. ‚ÄúTo an appointment. We can talk later.‚Äù

He nodded, tucking a stray lock of hair behind my ear, and I melted under his touch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äîthat wasn‚Äôt fair to you,‚Äù he murmured.

I nodded, fighting back tears that once again sprang to my eyes.

‚ÄúI forgive you.‚Äù

The words felt strange as they left my lips. I wasn‚Äôt sure he even deserved forgiveness yet. I wanted more groveling from him‚Äîbut more than that, I didn‚Äôt want to lose him.

My lifelong love, the mate destined to be mine.

This was just a mistake we would overcome. It would make us stronger, intensifying our love.

I could endure the pain‚Äîthere was no other choice.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

‚ÄúWell, Luna.‚Äù The middle-aged doctor who always seemed bubbly and full of life sat across from me at her desk. ‚ÄúEr, Wren. Sorry,‚Äù she corrected herself with a smile.

I liked the title‚Äîit filled me with pride. To serve and protect the pack I loved, the one I grew up in alongside the man I had always loved but never thought I could have.

The title felt like a bond I hadn‚Äôt realized I needed‚Ä¶ until yesterday.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Dr. Lily,‚Äù I said, smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to get used to it soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery soon.‚Äù Her eyes sparkled as she flipped through my charts.

They widened slightly, then the smile returned. ‚ÄúVery soon, you‚Äôll be called something else.‚Äù

My brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCongratulations, Luna. You‚Äôre going to be a mother.‚Äù

I froze in place, letting the words sink in.

Looking down at my stomach, I laughed‚Äîa laugh of disbelief and joy.

We wanted this. I wanted this. And now it was happening.

A baby. We were going to have a baby.

I rubbed my stomach gently.

There was a life growing inside me.

Tears pricked my eyes, but now for a different reason.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The doctor‚Äôs smile grew. ‚ÄúJust a few weeks along. I‚Äôd say about five or six weeks‚Äîthat‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt show last time you were here. It must have happened just days ago. I want you to come back next week so we can do a proper scan, maybe with Noah. Okay?‚Äù

I nodded, unable to stop smiling even though my cheeks ached.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Joy flooded through me.

Everything felt right again. Better than right.

Perfect.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

After leaving the clinic, I clutched the papers confirming my pregnancy close to my heart.

I wanted nothing more than to tell him‚Äîit would be the perfect birthday present.

Though his birthday was tomorrow, the party was tonight‚ÄîI figured it was close enough.

When I walked into the packhouse, the atmosphere was completely different than when I left.

The air was charged with energy, and people bustled about. Omegas darted around with vases and platters of food, careful not to drop a single thing.

I didn‚Äôt understand. Everything had been set weeks ago. Decisions had already been made.

Luna Naomi nearly collided with me‚Äîor maybe I almost bumped into her.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Her eyes widened as she saw me. I shoved the papers into my pocket.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a change. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù

Her words caught me off guard.

She seemed genuinely pleased to take charge herself, saying it took her far less time than when I was involved.

‚ÄúWhat can I do?‚Äù I asked with a genuine smile. I was happy she needed me.

‚ÄúI told the omegas to redo the table settings in the dining hall. They‚Äôre cleaning it again now, but I need you to supervise them, make sure they‚Äôre doing it perfectly.‚Äù She handed me a clipboard and tapped the attached color swatches.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre changing everything?‚Äù

I looked down at the swatches‚Äîthey were completely different from what we‚Äôd finalized weeks ago.

‚ÄúYes. The prince is coming.‚Äù She waved her hand dismissively.

I fought back a laugh. A prince?

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you not been paying attention in your studies, Wrenia?‚Äù Her brown eyes locked on mine.

I flinched inwardly at the use of my full name.

‚ÄúI have. And the royal family stopped holding power a century ago,‚Äù I countered.

She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose like I was giving her a headache.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt hold power really, yes. But he is the leader of our territory; he represents us. They are still powerful‚Äînaturally‚Äîand we respect them and their bloodline,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAlpha Darius, the prince, has told us he‚Äôll attend this evening. I‚Äôve met him once. Of course, he‚Äôs invited to all our pack events, but usually he declines or sends a representative.‚Äù

I nodded but still didn‚Äôt understand. If he didn‚Äôt truly have power over us, why all the fuss‚Äîand, oh God, the fancy china I definitely shattered last time.

‚ÄúIf you have any questions, link me. This has to be perfect.‚Äù She turned and walked away, her heels clicking sharply on the floor.

I sighed, reviewing all the changes. At least I wouldn‚Äôt have to set out the silverware‚Äîjust oversee the process.

This would help keep my mind off the memory of Claire‚Äôs toned legs wrapped around my mate.

Anger flared again. That was in the past. The recent past, but still past.

I would focus on the future.

I patted my pocket, feeling the confirmation from the doctor.

The future‚Äîand this baby‚Äîwere all that mattered now.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

The afternoon dragged on but was over before I knew it.

Dusk settled beyond the tall dining room windows, and I yawned, silently cursing myself for not asking if I was allowed coffee.

I‚Äôd seen it a lot in movies, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how it affected us wolves.

‚ÄúWren, what are you still doing here?‚Äù Luna Natalia slipped inside, her hair and makeup perfect for the evening, though she hadn‚Äôt changed yet.

‚ÄúI was just finishing up. We only have a few more centerpieces for the smaller tables.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle that. Go get ready. It‚Äôs about to start.‚Äù She grabbed the clipboard from my hand, and I let her.

If I left before it was done, I knew I‚Äôd get in trouble.

No matter what I did, it was always wrong‚Äîand I‚Äôd come to accept that.

I would be Luna in a few months, and I hoped the hold she had on me would lessen.

Significantly.

I hoped.

Chapter 5

After a quick shower, I stepped into the sleek, silver gown that clung to my curves like it was tailored just for me. The color‚ÄîNoah‚Äôs favorite‚Äîhad been a point of debate in my mind all afternoon. I‚Äôd kept a few other dresses from the collection Luna Naomi had sent over for this occasion, but ultimately, I wanted to be seen tonight. The gown featured delicate straps and a plunging back, leaving me exposed in ways I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable with. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was dressing for the woman I was‚Äîor the one I was trying to become.

A soft knock echoed against the door, and my heart jumped as I reached for the sleek black gift box resting on the vanity‚Äîthe one holding the pregnancy test results.

‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù asked a voice I knew even better than Noah‚Äôs. I opened the door to find my mother standing there.

‚ÄúOh, Wren,‚Äù she breathed, her eyes sweeping over me. ‚ÄúYou look breathtaking.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on in.‚Äù I stepped aside with a smile.

‚ÄúI figured you might need a hand, with Leah out of town and all.‚Äù She gestured toward the vanity, and I nodded, settling into the chair.

Leah had been my closest confidante since middle school, the kind of best friend who felt more like a sister. Every summer, her family took an extended vacation, and though I missed her tonight more than I cared to admit, I understood how much those trips meant to her. She‚Äôd be back in a few weeks, and I‚Äôd have plenty to tell her when she returned. I glanced down at my stomach, unable to keep from smiling.

But Noah would be the first to know. Even before Mom. The urge to shout it from the rooftops was suffocating.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I murmured as my mom began curling sections of my hair. I stayed as still as I could, trying to steady my hand while I lined my eyes and dabbed on shimmering eyeshadow that matched the silver of my dress. I wasn‚Äôt half as good at it as Leah, but tonight wasn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit was about Noah. And I doubted anyone would even glance at my makeup once they saw the way I looked for him.

‚ÄúThere we go,‚Äù she said, brushing out the curls until they settled in soft waves. My hair had a bit of a natural bend to it, but her touch gave it elegance.

‚ÄúOne last thing.‚Äù She opened a velvet box she‚Äôd brought with her. ‚ÄúI know tonight is about Noah, but you‚Äôre on the verge of becoming Luna. Your father and I‚Ä¶ we couldn‚Äôt be prouder.‚Äù

She took out a delicate white gold hair comb, sparkling with tiny diamonds and deep blue sapphires.

‚ÄúGrandma‚Äôs?‚Äù I asked, reaching out to touch it, my hand pausing midair.

She nodded. ‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

I watched in the mirror as she pinned back a section of my curls, tucking the heirloom into place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely radiant,‚Äù she whispered, resting her head on my shoulder before pressing a kiss to my temple.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, leaning into the warmth of her affection.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs not be late. The mate of the guest of honor can‚Äôt exactly arrive after things have started,‚Äù she teased, slipping seamlessly into her Luna voice.

I grabbed a sheer shawl from the closet and draped it over my bare arms and back. It made the dress feel a bit more modest, a bit more like me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in there,‚Äù she said, heading off toward the grand dining hall. I, on the other hand, made my way to meet Noah and his parents in his father‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stunning,‚Äù Noah said as he curled my hand around his arm. ‚ÄúBut maybe showing a bit too much skin for a Luna-to-be.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a compliment‚Äînot really. More like a reprimand, dressed up in a whisper.

‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, not even sure what I thought. That I looked the part? That he‚Äôd appreciate me putting in the effort for him? I felt foolish now.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fine line between classy and slutty,‚Äù he murmured, brushing his lips against my ear. I shivered from the contact, doing my best to drown the sting of his words in the warmth of his touch.

Together, we entered the dining hall, flanked by his parents. The room stood to greet the future Alpha with a round of applause.

Despite everything, I felt a surge of pride walking in beside him. We glided between the tables until we reached the long table reserved for ranked members and honored guests.

I moved to sit at his right, like I always had.

‚ÄúShift over one,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù My seat had never changed.

‚ÄúThe prince is joining us,‚Äù he said coolly, pulling the chair out so I could move.

I stood, sliding into the next seat without protest. I reached for a flute of champagne out of habit but stopped short. I wasn‚Äôt drinking tonight‚Äînot with our baby growing inside me.

The speeches began, but the seat between us remained empty. He didn‚Äôt motion for me to return, didn‚Äôt offer a smile or a glance.

I drifted into my thoughts, only snapping out of it when Luna Naomi gave me a pointed look and whispered my name.

Right. I stood just as the prince took the chair between us. He glanced my way, and I nodded politely before looking past him to Noah.

That‚Äôs when Claire entered.

Chapter 6

The man beside me may have said something, but I didn‚Äôt hear a word. My entire focus narrowed on Claire as she strode toward the table, her body hugged tight in a strapless black dress that flared dramatically with each step. Her lips were painted in a bold, blood-red hue, and her confidence was a spectacle all on its own.

She greeted the man next to me with a sugary smile before directing a gleaming grin my way‚Äîher teeth bright, fake, and far too perfect. I returned a smirk disguised as a smile, thinking of what was hidden inside the little black box. That news would strip the grin off her face in an instant.

‚ÄúThe future Luna looks exquisite,‚Äù the man said, nodding after Claire.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not the future Luna,‚Äù I said, my voice tight as I clenched my fork.

‚ÄúOh‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù I snapped, fixing him with a glare. His pale blue eyes blinked in surprise, then softened as he looked at me more carefully.

‚ÄúI meant no offense.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. My attention was glued to Claire as she leaned across the table and whispered something in Noah‚Äôs ear. His eyes widened briefly before a slow smile crept across his lips.

What the hell was that? He knew exactly how this would look, how it would make me feel. My hand twitched toward the mind-link, ready to confront him, when the man beside me broke the silence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always hated events like these. Too formal. Too fake.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you prefer instead?‚Äù I asked, eyes still locked on Noah.

‚ÄúSomething small. Something real. Just the people who actually matter.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúNow that sounds like heaven. But not exactly on-brand for ranked members and their obsession with appearances. The Lunas would probably collapse from sheer boredom.‚Äù

He let out a laugh‚Äîa real one, loud and warm. It drew Noah‚Äôs attention, along with his parents‚Äô.

I smiled at them like nothing was wrong.

Claire finally stopped parading at the head of the table, only to loop around and settle in beside Noah. People literally shifted their seats so he could make room for her.

Anger surged through me like a wave crashing against the shore. The audacity of it. Of her. Of him.

What the hell was he thinking? Maybe he was just being polite. Maybe. But this? This crossed the line.

The man next to me eventually excused himself, offering polite apologies to Noah and his parents.

Most of the other guests filtered out soon after, leaving behind only the ranked members and a few stragglers‚Äîmy parents among them.

Claire leaned in close to Noah, smiling at him like they shared some inside joke. Every fiber of me wanted to slap that smile off her face.

But instead, I handed him the gift.

‚ÄúI wanted to give this to you earlier, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off with a shrug, biting my lip.

He took the box, curiosity flickering across his face as he opened it and pulled out the slip of paper.

My stomach twisted with nerves and joy, butterflies swarming as I waited for his reaction.

This was something we‚Äôd both longed for. And now, here it was‚Äîproof of a baby. The Moon Goddess herself had timed it perfectly. A child to carry on the Alpha line, arriving just months before our official ascension.

‚ÄúWren?‚Äù His voice caught, and for a second, I saw emotion flash in his eyes‚Äîsomething like hurt‚Äîbefore his face hardened.

‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd told me in private,‚Äù he said, jaw clenched.

The excitement in my chest began to crumble. What did it matter if no one else knew yet? He hadn‚Äôt even made an announcement.

Then he stood.

‚ÄúI, Noah Henderson, future Alpha of the Azure Hollow Pack, reject you, Wrenia Barnes, as my mate and future Luna.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand the words.

But my body did.

Pain burst through me like a wildfire, our bond tearing apart at the seams. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt move. It was as if my blood had been replaced with fire.

This wasn‚Äôt heartbreak.

This was death.

I moved out of her parents' house and back into my own home with my son. We were texting each other and video talking the whole time. It was strained but we both kept talking about the future and how much we still cared for each other.

Today I was setting up her new phone and discovered texts to her ex husband from that time period in which she was saying to him she was done with the relationship and wanted to meet him for coffee...I matched that up to the time we were still talking and she was saying to me at the same time that things were hard with us but she sees the future together...

So here I am in 2025 after just getting engaged and talking about us getting married, renting together for a while etc. Then I have to contend with this discovery and her admission a few weeks ago that she drunk texted herself in a bikini to her ex a couple of years ago (I dont know when this happened and she just says it was the time we separated...). I was loyal to her through all of this.

Her ex husband is re married. I've seen that even though we have been living together, she has leaned on him with a lot of texts back and forth about her business etc. The kids I can understand as they share 2 girls together. But the rest I don't know. She says she got closure at the end of last year and beginning of this year...so the 3 years we have been together make me feel like she hasn't been that committed to me.

Now the question in my mind is whether all the stuff she did over the past couple of years is worth ignoring and just moving forward with the engagement, moving together etc.

I'm taking my time and I know I'm going to need some time to myself to really think hard about the future. I have to also establish a side business to make enough money to support myself out there as I feel like I will struggle on my full time wage alone (even by myself let alone with my partner).

What do you guys think? I've told myself that I was at least 100% loyal and dont have anything on my conscience...",1,1749803906.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Who I‚Äôm hoping to connect with:

Aged 18‚Äì26

Based in the UK (even better if you‚Äôre also in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person - whether it‚Äôs for coffee, concerts, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

‚öΩ Football fan ‚Äî I play weekly

ü§ò Big into rock & metal ‚Äî always down for gigs

üéÆ Gamer ‚Äî mostly into single-player games across genres

üé¨ Into Marvel and all things nerdy

üèéÔ∏è I love go-karting and visiting theme parks

üß† Neurodivergent ‚Äî emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I‚Äôm not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no intention of building something real

What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with chatting regularly, maybe gaming or voice calling

Open to hanging out or doing things in person down the line


If you‚Äôre messaging me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself, just to show you actually read this and want to connect.

Thanks for reading.

My father was not present a lot during me and my siblings childhood, he was working all the time but also there was a mentality that fathers should be cold and this authority figure. 

While I do have other problems with my relationship to him, recently he has gotten obsessed to do things that I have clearly asked them not to do. Like shoving fruits in my 5 months mouth to lick, or meat or juices and try to convince me how 50 years back, they used to give this and that to babies. 
Next he will be holding the baby nonstop even when he is completely calm in his stroller. I have asked him and my mother not to, because soon as we go home baby wants to stay in my arms all day and I can‚Äôt even go to the bathroom or wash my hands because he starts screaming.
When baby gets fussy or starts crying he wants to grab the baby from my arms to calm him down, bro, I‚Äôm his mom? 
When we go out he takes the stroller from my hands and wants to control everything we are doing. Like where we will be talking the walk or having a coffee. 
Even though I have to specifically choose places to not be too hot or too cold, or not crowded because of baby. Similar things like this are making me so angry and uncomfortable.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

For a thousand words, I embarked on a reflective exploration, utilizing the initial letters of key words to weave a tapestry of emotions, experiences, and revelations. Each line unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired‚Äîa subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I'm tattoo lover (don't have enough of them yet), coffee addict (let's say 4 daily aren't enough). I'm beard owner, probably my hair are longer than yours üòè. 

Bit sarcastic, mostly bored and mostly here. If I won't reply I'm either busy working, playing games or just lazy to check, but hey, trying my best! I can annoy you with random shts, sky or sunset pics out of nowhere, or just hypnotize you with my eyesüëÄ. 

I'm rock listener, shows watcher and gamer (mentioned above). I prefer long-term chats, that's always nice, I'm havin hard time remembering names, so if you'll say yours, I'll have to scroll upüòÖ. If we click, we can move somewhere else, as this crap is laggy or not working properly most, of the time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm not gonna call with you, but I have no problem with voice notes I guess. 

If it sounds at least bit interesting, hit me up, don't be scared!

I‚Äôm a 22 year-old guy based in London, and I‚Äôm here to build real, long-term friendships - the kind that ideally includes meeting up in person eventually. I think it‚Äôs hard to form genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

If you're just messaging out of boredom or likely to ghost after a day, feel free to skip this post as I‚Äôm looking for meaningful connections, not quick chats.

Who I‚Äôm hoping to connect with:

Aged 18‚Äì26

Based in the UK (even better if you‚Äôre also in London or nearby)

I have often read that Duolingo isn't optimal, and I do know that. I study way beyond just following their course. However, I have a very different question today, so please ignore which flawed app is involved. üòÅ

ÊàëÂ∏¶..Âêß is turned into ""Let us bring...""
What is very confusing to me.
It should be Êàë‰ª¨Â∏¶...Âêß thenÔºå or notÔºü

Are these translations all wrong, or is there a concept I just don't know about and this is kind of the right way to put it?
To me it seems that only the last exercise of this lesson was correctly translated: ""I will bring two cups of coffee."" - ÊàëÂ∏¶‰∏§ÊùØÂíñÂï°Âêß

Appreciate any input, and after your confirmation I am going to flag the issue every time it comes up. ‚úåüèª

Any ideas on other gas powered single group machines to look for?
