I have just finished the last of 5 levels of Pimsleur which has helped a lot but am looking for good options as a replacement. For now I’ve been pumping in as much comprehensible input/listening as I can, though this doesn’t work on output/speaking/recall like Pimsleur (mainly been doing EasySpanish, Dreaming Spanish, Cuéntame, Coffee Break Spanish, etc.). If anyone has any tips or resources that have gone through this late beginner/early intermediate stage that would be awesome, thanks!",1,1733501426.0,SpanishLearning,0,1.0,False

Gryzzk looked around. The mess hall itself was a cramped affair, with multiple containers marked with the seals of the lords on the ship packed in every corner around the circular table. There was a slight moment of nostalgia as he saw the seal of Lord A'kifab. And there was a great deal of resentment and thinly disguised contempt – not all of it coming from the Vilantians.

Still, he was not here to beg forgiveness for an imagined transgression - particularly since if things came to a violent crescendo, there were three Terrans who were quite willing to craft a grand symphony. In addition he was fairly certain the pads that held the forms of the Executive Officers of each ship had defensive capabilities. He looked around at the table, and it appeared that his place was to be directly opposite the captain of the *Godsfang*. On his left was Major Williams and First Sergeant Brooks, along with a blue luminescent figure he presumed was the XO of the *Voided Warranty*. The XO was certainly different from Rosie. Tall, muscular, and bearded, the XO seemed to have a bit more of a presence than Rosie. Perhaps it was simply experience.

Still, Captain Bahlgruhf of the *Godsfang* held a quiet confidence – it was his ship, after all. Once he sat, the other Lords seated themselves – the Lead Servants stood behind their respective Lords, keeping silent. Similarly, Rosie and the other XO took station behind their respective commanders, with the Sergeants seating themselves to the right of the officers.

Lord A'ogan had gotten somewhat fat since the last time Gryzzk had seen him, and he made his position quite clear from the outset. ""Captain, I respect your position as Lord of the *Godsfang*. But I must adhere to tradition – I do not hear the words of the Nameless who sits clad in the twilight. Nor will I hear the words of those who call him companion."" He leaned back, satisfied with his pronouncement.

Gryzzk was not surprised, but made no move to apologize, simply looking at Lord A'ogan flatly. The two First Sergeants glanced at each other, nodded, and took up their dinner knives and casually began to roll them over their knuckles intricately – a blunt reminder that at least two of the Terrans at the table had no qualms about getting their nice uniforms dirty. The other lords seemed to be in the midst of deciding what to do with this new information and appeared to be waiting to see where the wind would take this conversation.

Captain Bahlgruhf seemed to take the pronouncement in stride. ""You are under no requirement to speak at my table. But if I can speak with the one known as the Butcher of Hyla IV when tradition calls for me to kill you and return your furless corpse to your clan, surely you can see the wisdom in hearing voices you do not wish to listen to?""

Lord A'ogan took a deep breath, exhaling slowly – Gryzzk could sense the seething rage as the Lord was attempting to decide if his war record was a thing worth arguing over. Finally he took another breath. ""Apologies, Captain. My knees have been troubling me of late."" There was a weak smile. ""My wife will probably insist on a poultice before bed this evening.""

For Gryzzks' part, it was a bit of a revelation – Lord A'ogan had always been regaled – even revered – as a hero of the war. It seemed that a Vilantian hero was a Hurdop demon; and the reverse was probably true. He grimaced inwardly as he remembered the assault attempt from a few weeks ago.

Bahlgruhf smiled in return. ""I would not dare to interfere with a wife tending her husband. Now then. In that spirit of cooperation and blending societies, we have spent some time in the Terran colony of New Casablanca, and my crew has taken to a few of the Terran dishes. It seems that Terrans have animals called 'birds' that are unknown on both our worlds, and they are a delight. I felt it appropriate to include along with the traditional meal of welcome, chicken nuggies with sauces and something called french fries. We were able to find a few complementary spices as well."" At this, a crewman came in and began setting trays down in front of everyone. It was honestly surprising - the meal itself was different than what Gryzzk would have expected, but the concept was not. The chicken nuggies and fries with sauce were paired with Vilantian nuts and fruits. For his own part, Gryzzk looked things over and decided he was going to have to learn more about the Hurdop and quite possibly why the Great Civilization was even done.

This was something that occupied his thoughts until he glanced to his left then his right and found that his was the only plate in his section that still had anything on it. The conversation was muted during the meal proper, with a few of the lords leaning in to whisper to Lord A'kifab for one reason or anther. The dominant scent seemed to be curiosity and shame, while a similar conversation was taking place on thee other side with a second clique headed by Lord A'ogan. The scents there seemed to be resentment and...arrogance.

Captain Bahlgruhf gestured to Major Williams. ""Major; it is rare for us to have Terran guests – and it seems that we will be working working together for a time. What can we expect from you?""

The major smirked a bit. ""Our best.""

There was a slight chuff of amusement. ""A very diplomatic non-answer.""

The major spread his hands slightly by way of apology. ""If you're asking me to brag, we can go with the most recent - there was a little dust-up involving the Throne-Heir of Vilantia. Four squads in, four squads out, none of my teams lost a life, one Hurdop ship captured and sold at auction, a second ship captured for salvage and re-designation and more then a few of the Hurdop Royal Guard now serve in the Terran Foreign Legion. All in all, successful and profitable to all concerned.""

There was a snort from Lord A'ogan. ""Child's play. Anyone could have done such things.""

Major Williams rested his chin in his palm, looking over. ""Then why didn't you? The glory of the rescue of the Throne-Heir of Vilantia would have catapulted you to unimaginable heights. And yet, Vilantians hired Terran mercenaries for the feat. You honored the lone Vilantian for his effort by casting him out. It didn't strike you as odd that the first image the people saw of the return of the Throne-Heir was to be seen with an outcast and a Hurdop child? One would think such a poor specimen of Vilantia would not be seen with planetary royalty. The child is doing well, by the way. In addition, the first Vilantian emissaries to Hurdop Prime are being escorted by that same company along with the Terran. Foreign. Legion."" The major emphasized each of the last words with a slight tap of his fingernail against the table.

There was a snap of anger in Lord A'ogan's scent as he replied, and his neighbors seemed to share in that anger. ""I was not given leave to do so by Great Lord Aa'Porti. I asked for one final glory. I could have. But I was refused, the Great Lord saying plans were already in motion. And unlike *some*, I adhere to the Clan Way.""

Gryzzk glanced over at Lord A'kifab by instinct, to see his former Lords' posture almost obsequious. It seemed that Lord A'ogan had established himself as first among equals before boarding.

The Major cocked his head. ""Enlighten me – I have heard of the Clan Way, and that some actions are permitted, others forbidden. But I confess I haven't been able to really study it."" He seemed genuinely curious as to what it was about.

For his part, Gryzzk noticed Captain Bahlgruhf was watching this exchange closely – there seemed to be more than one student attentive to what Lord A'ogan was going to teach.

The Lord sat tall and proud as he spoke. ""The Clan Way has held our path for thirty-three generations. The tenets are simple - we obey our elders, our Great Lords, The Lords' Council, and the Throne. We command our lessers, imparting wisdom and guidance to their lives with lessons learned from the generations before. In circumstances of Lower Law, we adjudicate. In circumstances of Greater Law, we defer. Where clans conflict, we defer. Where worlds conflict, we defer to the Throne. For crimes, they are sent away to serve the Twenty-First Clan for a time in whatever they can do. In greater crimes, they are stripped of their Name that it may be given to another worthy of the Name. In the greatest crimes, the Nameless and their issue are killed and given to the twilight where no gods can give them penance. Thus it is, and thus it must be.""

""And yet you go to Hurdop. Why?""

Inwardly, Gryzzk felt somewhat satisfied that he was not the subject of the questioning – and he was certain that the Major was going to have learned quite a bit more about Lord A'ogan than the lord would like.

""Because Great Lord Aa'porti commanded it. He said this would recompense for what was denied."" He paused. ""And I must admit, it will be...pleasant to set foot on Hurdop."" Gryzzk caught a rare scent, something that brought back memories of museums; it was a scent of conquerors of unknown lands. He wasn't entirely sure he was escorting a peace offering to the Hurdop.

""No questioning of orders?""

""None. It is their right. It is our duty.""

""Huh."" With that one word from Major Williams, Gryzzk had a flashback to a conversation with Lieutenant Muranaga and wondered if Lord A'ogan knew he was being judged. ""So that's one contribution, and I thank you for showing me the 'what' of the Clan Way. But I am also intrigued by the 'why' of the Clan Way, and I'd rather not monopolize your time that could be well-spent eating. Would Lord A'kifab care to offer his knowledge for us here?"" The Major looked to the other side of the table where said lord was looking not unlike a small prey animal about to be devoured.

""Ah, well. I am no historian. But the current Clan Way was a product of the times before the Great Civilization."" Lord A'kifab spoke softly, but with a confidence that Gryzzk had only heard when his former Lord was speaking of something he knew a great deal about. It seemed that Lord A'kifab had immersed himself in historical study since their departure. ""The texts are unclear, but briefly – the time directly before was one of chaos and war. Within that period scientists from the three warring factions worked in secret and built first chemical rockets and then subsequently were able to leap to low-efficiency anti-gravity, and then as they spread out further one group was able to make the discovery of R-space. The factions fought over who could control the technology. Which, words turned to claws and then weapons. One faction was destroyed completely, and there is no record of their existence; their lands were turned into a barren waste that even now is unfit for habitation. They are the Forever Nameless in documents that acknowledge their existence.""

The Vilantians at the table made a warding gesture over their noses, as if to keep a rotting scent from them as Lord A'kifab continued.

""Of the two, there were the Named and the Nameless - the Nameless chose to leave Vilantia and, well...they became the Hurdop. The Named who left gathered their strongest and wisest and decided that order must be enforced, not just at a small level, but at a large one as well. And so the Clan Way became not law, but tradition. In the words of the First Throne; 'Order must been maintained, peace must be kept. We must be one self, be forever whole within that self, and give our children the benefit of ourselves. The Wise must heed the Wise, and give that wisdom to their lessers lest their ignorance cause misadventure and sorrow.' It was a product of its time, and has remained because it has been successful in maintaining Vilantian peace through several crises - the Collective Testing, and the Famine of the Twentieth Generation, as examples. And of course, the many wars between Vilantia and Hurdop - respectfully I would rather not speak of those in this company.""

Major Williams stroked his chin thoughtfully. ""Now that is interesting. Captain Bahlgruhf, anything to add on that one?""

Captain Bahlgruhf nodded. ""The history of the Hurdop is...somewhat similar. We are not so orderly, with many smaller clans rather than the twenty-one clans of Vilantia. There are clans that even now resist the peace our Throne has announced. Most of them are our Spacebound Clans that travel the stars permanently and never feel the gravity of a planet."" There was a stifling gesture as the captain kept a yawn from escaping. ""I suppose this has been a learning experience for all. However, the ships' hour grows late, and I believe our respective helms would like to coordinate prior to our entry into R-space. I'm sure you can all find your way to your respective ships?""

There was a nod from the Major. ""Indeed. Your generosity will not be forgotten.""

The Vilantian lords began filing out slowly, with Gryzzk holding O'Brien back. ""The lords leave first – for the to pass through air touched by a Nameless is improper.""

Her reply was a snort. ""They don't wanna travel in the wake of a shit-wrecking badass, more like. Might make their pee-pee's all tiny.""

Rosie spoke as well. ""That was a very poor explanation of the Clan Way. There was no mention of exceptions. It seems he wishes to assert himself. Interesting. In any event, we have ship matters to attend.""

There was a nod. ""We do. We'll need to confirm the cargo's stowed properly.""

They walked carefully through corridors to find Lord A'kifab standing at the hatch connecting to the *Twilight Rose*. Lord A'kifab had a varying mix of scents on him. It seemed almost maddening at the moment, but the most surprising seemed to be despair.

Gryzzk didn't say anything. He couldn't. And so it was a bit of a surprise when Lord A'kifab made a rapid motion toward Gryzzk, hand outstretched.

What happened next was hard to describe – on the up side, there was no obscene injury done unto Gryzzks former lord, but he was not in a position of comfort with O'Brien's knee firmly wedged on his throat. Gryzzk grimaced slightly as he detected a slight scent of urine.

""My...Lady First Sergeant. My lady please. I...have a gift."" Lord A'kifabs voice was a forced whisper.

""Aye, and the last thing you gave him was such a fine thing?"" O'Brien lifted her knee just enough to allow breathing to be more comfortable.

""This is different. He will know it."" Lord A'kifab wheezed, turning his palm up to reveal a piece of bark that had been broken in half.

Rosie's analysis was immediate. ""Tree. Closest approximation is from *Sequoioideae*. Not lethal First Sergeant.""

O'Brien stood. Slowly. But she did help him up after she stood up. ""Respectfully, if you'd pass the word – we really like our captain, and surprising him isn't the best thing."" She did however take the bark and place it in one of the many pockets on Gryzzks uniform.

""A lesson well learned. I am not allowed to express sentiment toward a Nameless. But it is good that he has guardians like you."" The lord lifted his head a bit. ""I must go now. I have items to read.""

The three were silent as they crossed back to the *Twilight Rose*, with Rosie nodding as Gryzzk landed. ""Captain on the ship. Captain, we have things to discuss.""

Rest was apparently not an option. ""Continue, XO.""

""Among the cargo we took onboard from the *Godsfang* there was an explosive device.""

""A *what*?!"" Both Gryzzk and O'Brien were moving toward the cargo even as they exclaimed in unison, Gryzzk tapping his rank for a channel. ""Chief Warrant Officer Tucker to the cargo bay, *immediately*.""

Rosie's voice came on the comm channel as soon as Gryzzk was done. ""Belay that order, Chief. Return to your duties, I will explain directly in a moment.""

""XO. Explain."" As he spoke, Gryzzk pulled the latch and hauled the deckplate up to access the cargo bay. In a moment that would have been comical in other circumstances both he and O'Brien tried to be the first down the ladder with the result of them both getting stuck.

""The explosive has been disarmed. It was fairly simple overall. There was only the one on the ship, but I was able to detect and disarm four others on the *Godsfang*.""

O'Brien struggled a bit to unwedge herself. ""XO. For love of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Almighty, fucking *lead* with that next time!""

It was at this time that Chief Tucker came strolling to the cargo entrance, chuckling softly. ""All this and I get paid too."" He nodded casually. ""Cap'n, XO. Top. I would love to hear how this happened."" So saying he bent and lifted Gryzzk by his armpits up and out, with the result of O'Brien being freed and snagging a rung of the ladder to pull herself back up and finally re-securing the deckplate, muttering dark things about drama queen AI's and skewed priorities.

Gryzzk checked his pocket first to make sure that nothing had been broken there. Then he took a breath. ""Now that we are all here, XO. Explain in detail how the explosive was allowed on board – in addition, there should be one more. Vilantians work in sixes, and I only count five.""

""It was detected immediately upon its arrival onboard. I was able to perform a close scan and subsequently was able to modify the scanning beam so that the explosives themselves were rendered inert. The procedure was repeated for the next four as we entered and left the *Godsfang*. The sixth was loaded to the cargo hold of the *Voided Warranty*. I advised Warren of what I had found and confirmed that he had performed the same actions.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""Very well. Chief, dismissed – return to your duties, and get some sleep."" Gryzzk checked his tablet and saw the time and realized it was relatively late. ""You as well, First Sergeant. You're dismissed until morning.""

Gryzzk walked to the bridge, shaking his head a little at the oddness. It took a moment to realize that Rosie was gliding next to him, her posture somewhat exaggerated and belying nervousness.

""You have something, XO?""

""I have a question regarding – regarding Terrans. If you have a moment.""

""I'm not sure I'm the best one to answer those questions. We do have Terrans on board."" While Gryzzk was certainly curious, there were Terran experts on board - specifically the Terrans.

""I should like a Vilantian opinion before I continue.""

They both entered the bridge. The staff looked a little tired, and Gryzzk could smell old coffee from them. ""Staff; XO has the ship. You are dismissed until tomorrow morning."" The crew gratefully accepted the dismissal, heading to their respective quarters. Gryzzk opened the door to his quarters, beckoning Rosie in and smiling a bit at Nhoot having fallen asleep in the middle of the bed.

Rosie's ears flickered as she looked upward slightly. ""Captain. I should like your opinion on humans – Terrans, that is.""

""They are diverse and exceptional. I am, having thoughts as to their ways; they are a clan without the Clan Way to guide them, and they manage to surprise me in a new way every day.""

""I have been conducting research. Do you think that we are attractive to Terrans?""

Gryzzk blinked. ""Grezzk calls me handsome, and for me that is enough. Why do you ask?""

""I have found a particular subset of Terrans in my research. They call themselves 'furries' and they seem to enjoy wearing costumes of Terran animals - however it seems there are undocumented rules surrounding this activity. I have not yet seen any costumes of Vilantians in their midst however, and while logic would dictate that we would be desirable as a costume among them, I have not found any in my research.""

""It is quite possible that we are not significant to Terran culture for such a thing."" Gryzzk shrugged. ""And to be fair, the reverse is also true – Vilantians do not wear Terran costumes.""

""Perhaps I will need to perform more research."" Rosie seemed satisfied. ""May I ask a personal question, sir?""

""You may.""

""The bark. What is its significance, and why did Lord A'kifab seem in distress?""

Gryzzk took the piece out and inhaled deeply. ""It is from Lady A'kefabs tree. It is a valuable thing to him, and by giving it to me, it shows that he has a hope of reconciliation in the future. If tradition holds, he carries the other half.""

There was a pause as Rosie considered. ""Her funeral tree."" Another pause. ""Will you be returning it with your fur later?""

""Not today. Perhaps one day.""

""Very well. I shall attend the ship and alert you if needed. Good night captain.""

As Rosie left, Gryzzk felt a mild surprise at his weariness. The events of the day had left him tired, as if market day had coincided with a festival. He changed to sleepwear and set the bark on his desk before falling into bed, avoiding waking Nhoot.

With the morning came activity, as Gryzzk took care of the morning details. Nhoot was already gone and probably at some form of mischief. Somehow he'd managed to sleep in a bit. Gryzzk checked for messages and opened the door to the bridge to find his staff already present and having a discussion of sorts with Rosie. Reilly was giving her opinion at the moment.

"" - I'm sure that Edwards here has at least the start of an idea – all I'm asking is if you've considered tactical nudity?""

Hoban piped up. ""I'm not sure she'll get that concept just by talking about it, maybe a demonstration's in order?""

Gryzzk cleared his throat before anyone could reply. ""New rule. There will be no nudity, tactical or otherwise, on the bridge."" His voice conveyed the astonished disappointment of a parent who cannot believe that they actually have to make a rule for a situation.

Everyone, including Rosie, looked a little guilty as Gryzzk made his presence known. For his part, Gryzzk was not in any frame of mind to make inquiries regarding the conversational sequence that led to that particular destination.

Reilly made a disappointed sound. ""Aww, but Captain, Rosie needs help.""

""It can wait. We can relax once we've fully exited the system. In the meantime, confirm with Captain Bahlgruhf and Major Williams that they are available for conference prior to R-space today.""

Reilly shifted gears rapidly, hands moving over her console. ""Confirmed.""

""Edwards, advise Lieutenant Gregg-Adams to perform a deep scan of the cargo we took on yesterday and cross-match it against the manifest we were provided. He can borrow you if needed. I'll be in the mess if anyone needs me."" And with that he exited the bridge and went straight to the mess hall, grabbing a few items from the go-basket for crew who were in a hurry and then checking the drink selection before grabbing a large mug of tea that smelled good. He carried them back and settled in the command chair to get the day underway.

Rosie glanced around. ""My Lord Captain, with your permission I would like to assist with the cargo inspection.""

Gryzzk nodded as he sipped, blinking in surprise. It smelled good, was good, and it seemed that he would be taking a liking to this. ""Of course, but defer to the Lieutenant as needed.""

O'Brien was next. ""Captain, what'd you get for breakfast?""

He looked at what he'd grabbed - it was a small foil-wrapped thing, warm and full of familiar scent. ""A 'Vilantian breakfast burrito' and this. Tea, Earl Grey."" Gryzzk sipped. ""Hot.""

The First Sergeant seemed to be accepting of this. ""Long as you got something.""

Gryzzk flicked an ear. ""First Sergeant, I can take care of myself.""

""Beggin' the captains' pardon but if you do you'll be the first. And not to put too fine a point on it but your Missus would never let me have dinner with you and yours again if I let you run yourself ragged, and I like her corned beef hash.""

Gryzzk absorbed this information and considered. ""Understood.""

Reilly nodded at a new indicator. ""Captain, the other ship commanders report ready to discuss.""

""I'll be in the conference room."" Gryzzk stood, carrying his tea in, and hoping there wasn't going to be a new problem before they hit R-space.",1,1733501377.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

a few weeks in i was sitting behind her and she randomly turned around and said hi. she then asked if i’m in two of her other classes, which i said yes to. we didn’t continue talking after that but ig the interaction was random enough for me to keep the moment in my head. over time she sorta just became a hallway crush: nothing serious, just something fun to imagine while i was bored in classes. i complimented her clothes every once in a while, but that was the extent of our conversations. 

idk what the sudden flip was, but i started noticing that while waiting in between classes we shared, she would stand very close to me in the hallway. at first she never said anything and would just scroll on her phone, but eventually she’d start butting into convos i’d have with mutual friends, which in turn got us talking more. she followed me on insta first. a few days when by and i worked up a minimal amount of courage to like two of the posts she made. not even five minutes after she followed me on her spam account, which pretty much only had ppl from her school following it. after this i figured she liked me well enough to at least consider me friendly so i made an effort to talk to her more. 

in class we were assigned in the same group for a final project so that helped a lot, and it also got me her number. i noticed she started leaning in more while we joked around waiting for class, and that our state would meet more often from across the room, etc. she began striking up convos w me after class too, and i’d walk with her until the end of the block where we then split ways cuz of different routes.

coming back from break this week, i decided to sit in front of her in class, and we talked abt our group project and a movie we both wanted to see. i texted her later to see if she wanted to come w me and some of my friends to see said movie. at first i thought i was cooked cuz she said she had a lot of hw, but then she actually showed up!

it was kind of awkward hanging out with her outside of school, but comforting in a way too cuz i could tell she was also nervous? her face would get rlly red if i said something remotely flirty, or she’d stumble on a word and cover her face with her hand. she’s super funny tho so we mostly just sat around and riffed off each other (admittedly i was not paying attention to my friend group for most of the night 😭). she sat by me in the theater and our arms/legs kept brushing. we lowkey whisper talked thru the entire thing which i’m sure was extremely annoying for the ppl behind us (my bad). then i got to walk her home! 

we sat next to each other in class the day after that. then after class we were joking around abt a professor, then we started talking abt what we wanted to do after college, and she intentionally passed her usual turn to keep talking to me. i wanted to ask her out for coffee or something, but i chickened out. our goodbye was a little awkward too. 

anyways this was long and probably stupid, but idk! do y’all think i have a chance or is she just being friendly.

1h84iqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1h84iqe/aita_my_step_daughter_is_manipulative_and_i/,AITA? My Step Daughter is manipulative and I called her out.  Thinking of leaving the relationship…,"Sorry it’s a long one. 
I’m a 36 yof my boyfriend Matt is a 42 yom. Between the two of us there are three children my biological daughter Jenny is the youngest she is 11, his daughter Anna is 13 and his son Tim is 15. We have been living together for two and a half years.  For a little bit of context we live in a small town, although he is older than me I know his ex who’s his age. Not from the same friend groups, but I was friends with her sister in my early college years. My friend Amanda never had nice things to say about her sister Linda his x. Amanda and I became close we did vacations together even some holidays our parents even became friends. Over time she finished college and took a position with a company that has her traveling a lot. We stayed in contact through social media, but I also moved out of state after my husband cheated on me and was having a baby with another woman. We had only been married for a year and a half before I found out about his infidelity. It broke my heart we had been together since we were 15. So I started a new life in a big city met a man and became pregnant with my beautiful daughter at 26. Right before Covid I moved back to my hometown after leaving a very abusive relationship. I had kept to myself and spent my time back home restarting our life’s, focusing on my daughter and myself healing. It had been about 2 years of being home at this point. My daughter had talked me in to taking her to the high school play the following week. I had at that point made my public appearances slim. The night of the play I’d gotten out of work and was rushing to get ready slapped on some jeans and boots and we ran out the door. Of course, as soon as we get to the theater, my daughter abandon me for her group of friends. So there I was sitting by myself and I noticed Matt. We smiled at each other. I not thinking he’s going to know who I am or remember me continued to gaze around the room. The play soon started and my daughter returned to sit with me. Then a few weeks later, my friend Sam invites us to her son’s football game. I was finally starting to get out of my little hole and engage in social activities. So I packed up and we headed to the football field as I’m walking to the setting area there’s Matt and a guy I recognize from school. Again, Matt turned and smiled at me this time waving. I smiled and waved back, but continued walking to meet up with my friend Sam. I had noticed several times during the football game Matt looking our way. She also noticed the glances from Matt during the game. After the game, Sam and I are walking to our cars chasing kids. She looks up at me and says did you notice Matt eyeing you? I laughed it off and said yeah, but him and Linda are married, right? She said no they haven’t been together for like five years,  she proceeds to say Matt is a really sweet guy. She didn’t go into great detail about how much Linda screwed him over, but there was cheating,  manipulation and abuse. Later that evening while scrolling on the book Matt popped up in the people you may know category. I did know him so I dropped that tissue. It didn’t take him long to accept. A few days had gone by and I get a message from Matt asking if I’d like to hang out sometime. We went on the most amazing dates a little rough around the edges, but such a sweet man I fell head over heels for him total opposite of any man I’ve ever dated. Before we decided to move in together, we had a lot of conversations about our children. Including issues he had, had in the past with his daughter getting in between his relationship with his x of two years. It didn’t take long for Anna to start the drama with my daughter and me. Of course there was plenty to say from her mother regarding me her sister‘s friend.  I had no crush on Matt wasn’t even interested in him nor did I really even know him 16 years ago. There isn’t that much of an age gap between us just six years but that did not stop the rumors from Linda. I helped Matt overcome lots of hurdles with Linda, including getting more time with his kids. Matt did not fight in the divorce and pretty much let Linda have everything the house the car he was always the main breadwinner in the relationship, and Linda walked all over him. Since the beginning of our relationship he was open and honest about how much he regretted not standing up for himself. And how she still tries to run his life with the kids. After two years of working on my life I know a manipulating, narcissistic parent isn’t easy to navigate. Anna was having behavior issues, failing almost every class causing drama at home and school. Matt and I had plenty of conversations of how to reinforce a positive home environment when Anna was here. Tim much like his father has a very reserved personality very sweet boy, but he’s also walked on by his mother. The last few years we have had issues with Anna bullying my daughter lying about situations and always playing the victim after things don’t turn out her way. I stand my ground with Anna and let her know she’s in a loving but reinforcing home and everybody is accountable for their actions. My daughter was being a little mouthy the other day and was refusing to help with any of her chores, so I took her phone and had it charging in my office. The next morning I get up and I’m having my coffee and I grab her phone. I see she has a text from Anna who’s at her mom‘s house until this evening. Anna had sent her screenshots from a girl at school that Anna is bullying. Lots of information in the several screenshots. So I sent them to myself and forward them from my phone to Matt. I didn’t want him thinking that my daughter was causing drama as I wasn’t sure he knew I had her phone. I then decided I was going to check the rest of their conversations. I found screenshots that Anna had sent to my daughter of her bullying my boyfriend’s ex’s daughter Sara who is 9. She was telling this poor little girl that her mom left her because she’s a cheater and she’s a fat b. and she’s never gonna be anything because her mom left her. Horrible things I cried for this little girl reading these text messages. Part of the reason Matt and this woman broke up was because she wanted to move out of state leaving all the kids, including hers. Which she did a few months after her and Matt split the little girl is living with her grandma.  Upon reading these screenshots, I noticed one of them said Jenny my daughter was also texting her from Anna’s phone. Saying horrible things my daughter had never met  poor Sara. This really upset me that Anna could encourage my daughter to say such horrible things to this little girl. I confronted my daughter as soon as she got home from school before Anna arrived and she told me she in fact did write some of the horrible text with Anna‘s encouragement. This isn’t the first time that Anna has manipulated my daughter. So I reached out to our family community. I called Matt‘s mom. Read the text messages from Anna word for word and asked her opinion on what to do next. I was pretty uncomfortable reading these text messages, Matt‘s mom is a very strong Christian woman. She told me that Matt and I needed to have a very firm conversation with Anna on where we stand with her behaviors and choices. So before bedtime last night, Matt Anna and myself had a long conversation we found out not only is Anna bullying. She has a 34 grade point average in school for the first quarter. Anna denied any of her actions she denied bullying, she denied lying. She even denied sending the text to Sara saying it was a different Sara and that it was all my daughter that was texting not her. She cried she manipulated her dad and tried to weasel her way out of anything without taking any ownership. I was furious. Every time something was pointed out to her that she had done Anna had an excuse of why that was her behavior. There was no reasoning or understanding that was just the choice she made for retaliation. I then looked her in her eyes and sat forward and told her I know what it’s like to feel always the victim. I know what it’s like to have so much anger and hatred and you don’t know what to do with it. I know what it’s like to want to hurt somebody because you’re hurting. I tried my best to make my point in that moment that she needed a better counselor someone she could really talk to about all this anger and hatred that she holds. She started to cry and agreed. I told her how selfish she was how mean she was how evil it was to talk to such a little girl with hateful big words and that she wasn’t a good role model to be around my daughter. I also told her I was not giving her one damn thing for Christmas. This is when the tears really started. I told her because of her actions, words, behaviors, grades and lack of ownership.  I could not respect that and refuse to give her any gifts. This was a major blow for her because any gift I get her, she absolutely loves. I’m a very thoughtful person and usually listen very well and have a nag for finding perfect gifts for people. Last year she told everyone, including her mom that my gifts were her most favorite. So I know this is the best consequence for her actions. I hadn’t talked to Matt about my decision, I kind of made it in the moment he did agree with me. That’s when it hit me. I’m not Matt‘s wife, I am his live in girlfriend it’s not my place to continually have to lay down the law with his kids. He doesn’t even contact their mom to make detailed plans for Holidays he’s always allowing everyone else to take responsibility for the kids. We had in-depth conversations regarding his daughter, her behavior, the manipulation from his ex-wife, how she still runs the household here and he allows it. For two years I have had to play stepmom and make his daughter accountable and he just sits by and goes along with it. Last night, I said everything to her and he just reinforced it. I told him how this is really putting a damper on things that I’m his girlfriend not the kids stepmom and if I was their stepmom I would be even more disappointed with the lack of help from him. He made it clear from the beginning of the relationship that we would have a committed relationship, but he couldn’t offer me anything more. No marriage no children just living together. So last night, I told him I’m stepping back, there was no future for our relationship just a long-term commitment and I’m doing wife things for a man who just wanted to live with me. I buy all the groceries, Cook all the meals do the laundry, clean the house. Take care of everything work around schedules with games and schooling events all while working a full time job. Three years ago when we started dating, I was OK with not having any more kids. I was OK with not getting married, but I was also still working through a lot of things and was scared of any relationship. I do love Matt more than anything I have so much respect and admiration, but when it comes to the kids, I’m appalled at his lack of disconnection. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting more than a commitment out of the relationship? 
Am I in the wrong for being so hard on his daughter? 
Am I in the wrong for making him accountable for his children? 
Am I in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship if he can’t stand up to the plate?

1h84gqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1h84gqn/rome_venice_and_florence_hilton_hotels/,"Rome, Venice and Florence Hilton Hotels","

Did a week trip to Italy and stayed in Hiltons as we had five more stays to maintained the diamond status. Wanted to provide a good ""off-season"" report. 

Hilton Garden Inn FCO
Our flight was landing at 10:30 pm and the Leonardo Express Train was under repair for the weekend, so we stayed at the airport hotel rather than paying for Saturday night in Rome. 
Positives
- Airport shuttle was quick a d it is combined with the employee parking so it pretty consistent. 
- The breakfast had a true coffee bar and you could order different eggs made
Negative
- Hotel and room are old and have a dormitory feel out of the 90s. 
- No upgrades

Doubletree Monti Rome 
Two nights (Sunday/ Monday) in Rome as our base to explore the city. 
Positives: 
- Great location, walked pretty much everywhere including the Coliseum, Trevi fountain, and the Spanish steps. 
- Really nice updated room with a great king bed. Great lobby and good interaction with staff. 
Negatives:
- Breakfast was okay not great. 
- The hill from the Trevi fountain to the doubletree became annoying the fourth or fifth time we climb it. 
Hilton Stucky Milano Venice 
Two nights in Venice was the highlight of our trip. We lucked out with decent weather and very little crowds for December. 
Positive:
- absolutely a beautiful room (upgraded to a front facing room executive king room) and the public areas (executive lounge and breakfast area). 
- We loved the Hilton Boat Service back and forth across the lagoon and would go back and forth several times a day. 
Negatives:
- Getting to the hotel and back to the train station can be challenging. We used the public boat buses both ways and walk the 10 minutes back and forth. There are two small bridges but they were not too bad as we only had backpacks. Plan about an hour to get to the train, which caused us to miss breakfast on the second day.
Anglo American Hotel Florence. 
We stayed at the Anglo American a Curio Hotel in Florence for the last night.
Positive:
- proactively upgraded to a suit during our stay. It was a nice room and really comfortable bed, walk in closets, and bathroom. 
Neutral
- we like the neighborhood that we were in and found a fabulous restaurant for dinner that night and a great gelato place afterwards but it was a 20 minute walk to the Duomo or center of town. 
- We had a 7:05 train so we missed breakfast but they offered and provided a breakfast box to be ready for check out.
- 
Negative:
- There were little staffing issues (had to follow up 3 times for bottle water, offered breakfast box but only provided one breakfast rather than two). 
- The courtyard and lobby were small. 

Overall: Italy at the end of November/ beginning of December was wonderful, less crowds with the weather was in the mid50s. All except the Anglo American were under $200 per night which is pretty great.

1h84g9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h84g9r/physical_fight_with_mom/,Physical fight with mom,"I don't know where to start, really. I (17F) got into a bad physical altercation with my mom (40F) this morning, around a few hours ago. I am not looking for sympathy— I know I'm not in the right. Long story short, I've basically been a shitshow the entirety of highschool. It didn't start off exactly great, considering my dad killed himself like 2 months before freshman year started, so that was a huge blow. Then in sophomore year, I had a psychotic breakdown, escaped from school, and became a missing person for 12 hours in the middle of winter because I booked it into the woods. To top it all off, I'm an awful student. I did a lotta other concerning stuff, but that's for another time. 

Me and my mom have not been getting along this month. I've been put on antidepressants again (which don't work) and have been taking my ADHD meds consistently, but I still cannot focus for the life of me, and I have zero motivation or urgency for anything. Not surprisingly, my mom has not been very happy with my god awful grades, so things have been especially tense because it's December and I don't have much time before the semester ends. 

Basically, this morning, I woke up very early- around 4 am. I left my room to go freshen up in the bathroom, which is the same time my mom wakes up because she goes to the gym with her boyfriend. She was not happy to see me up at this time. She angrily asked why I was up this early, and I said that I didn't know why she was mad because she gets mad when I fall asleep early, gets mad if I fall asleep late, gets mad if I wake up early, and gets mad if I sleep in. This started an argument because she said because I don't do anything productive like doing my schoolwork instead and that my sleep schedule is bad. I responded with ""Well, I'm not sure what you want me to do then."" and received a HARD slap to the head. I immediately threw my hands up in a ""woah, woah"" sort of way, but my mom thought I was going to hit her back, and things escalated FAST. She was screaming at me telling me to hit her back and see what happens and I was walking backwards into my room, and things continued to get worse from there. She was screaming at me calling me a psychopath and an abuser and I sat down on my bed and stared, and things are very blurry right now so I can't remember much but I do admit I think I was being pretty disrespectful at this point, and got a punch to my side. She told me that she should beat my ass because I'm disrespectful, and I really wanted her to and held myself back from asking her if she could, but I regret not asking now. 

Then from what I can remember she got on top of me on my bed as she was screaming at me, and after a little bit of struggling and telling her to get off of me, I just gave up and stared up at her. I did make a show of making myself have a big yawn and made myself look as bored as possible, and she wrapped her hands around my neck and choked me for I'm not sure how long, but I know it wasn't that long. As a matter of fact, I felt happy. I liked the fact that she was hurting me, and I had to hold back a smile, but I didn't do a very good job because she continued to yell.

Eventually, she got off, and when she was walking away, my eyes were kind of flickery/twitchy, and I smiled. I didn't mean to, and I sound like a total edgelord, which I hate, but I can't deny that at this point I was very happy, and it just happened. She screamed at me and asked why I was smiled, but I looked at her innocently and managed to play it off as a yawn. After she left the house with her boyfriend, I felt euphoric. I looked in the mirror and looked at my injuries, a bruise here or there, my eye hurt, and my right arm was scratched up very badly. It made me so happy in a way I hadn't felt in a long time, and I just laughed and smiled to myself as I got dressed. I laid on my bed and just stared up at the ceiling, and I couldn't contain how happy I was. I hadn't been hurt like that in a long time, and it made me happy for it to happen again.

Around 10 minutes before I had to leave for the bus and they were back home from the gym, her boyfriend had a talk with me downstairs. He told me I need to get my act together and that if I was his biological daughter he wouldn't give me anything except basic necessities and how I need to stop my disrespect. I don't ask for anything except to go out with my friends occasionally— I know the kind of person I am and know I don't deserve anything, but I didn't point that out to him. Anyways, he said my mom has had a tough life and I know that, and that I'm going to make her snap soon. I said nothing and just stared at him when he asked if I liked ""torturing"" my mother. All I could do was silently shake my head.

But... yeah. That's really it. I know it was my fault, and I'm still coming down from the adrenaline of it all (or it might just be my coffee). I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest. I  don't know.

I'm 46, in my youth I always played basketball.
At age 25 I had an unfortunate motorcycle accident and ended up in a wheelchair paralyzed from the chest down.
About 2 years later someone gave me a buildingkit for a big ship but I soon lost intrest in that.
I did use the wood to build this.
It started with the floor, a first floor of seats
(Each seat made of 3 separate pieces, properly sanded.) then just kept adding.
A second floor of seats..
Woodburned all NBA logos for the walls.
Then decided to close it up and put lights in.
Then decided to expand it with a exterior boardwalk with trees and benches.
Then had a strong glass dome made to cover it. 
Then refurbished an old coffee table to put it on, applied a led between the table and the diorama and I was finally finished.

This piece was really important in my process to accept my situation.

I work for a relatively well known doctor in my area. He’s been going through a nasty divorce for over a year. The subpoena specifically mentions myself and 3 other employees by name. It’s asking for 3 things and appearance in court. It’s not signed by a judge, but from the opposing counsel. 

I’m so disinterested in being involved in this. I just work for the guy for crying out loud. I have a confidentiality agreement, since medical records and personal histories are incredibly important, but it covers the doctor and his personal doings as well. I *think* subpoenas would trump this? But I also don’t want anything to do with this!!! 

The ending says, “that failure to comply with this subpoena is punishable as contempt of court and shall make you liable to the person on whose behalf this subpoena was issued for a penalty not to exceed xxxxx and all damages.” Does this make it my problem or his if I don’t go? 

We would have to close the office for all of us to appear and cancel appts AND I just plainly don’t want to? The records they’re asking for 2/3 I don’t know anything about and the last is covered under my confidentiality agreement. Plus, he’s my boss and that’s incredibly uncomfortable. I need the money and I like the job. I’m just a medical assistant right now, but I want to move up as I continue my schooling.

Later, I’ll make a healthy dinner for us and plan a weekend away at a cottage full of hiking and nature. I might suggest a cheeky piece of cake in a cozy cafe, after hot yoga. I’ll go to bed at 9, happy, content and free.

1h847w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1h847w8/scrapyard/,Scrapyard,"Your brother is an artist. A sculptor, technically. But not the kind that makes things you want to spend any time looking at. His work is ""abstract."" Big twisted things with points and swirls and sticking-out pieces that promise to snag clothing and skin. Usually made from trash. Metal scrap. You are no stranger to calls from the scrapyard, the landfill, construction sites– places he can be found looting from again and again. 

People call you instead of the cops because your town is tiny. No one wants to fuck with the famous author's weird son. Maybe if Dad wasn't what put the town on the map to begin with, things would be different. Maybe they'd be better.

He called you half an hour ago from the scrapyard. He has been caught again. Will you come get him?

Sensing the tension across the room, where your husband sits on the couch, you sigh and answer the only way you really can.

“Yeah. I’m on my way.”

Your brother seems to think of this as a pleasant routine. Your husband, arms crossed, watching you pull your boots on, thinks the whole thing is inherently ridiculous and pathologically selfish on your brother's part.

""This isn't our problem. You're his brother, not his parent.""

""I'll be back soon,"" you say, threading your arms into your down coat. ""It's not a big deal.""

Your husband turns away from your kiss.

You let the car heat up for a while. As the windows defrost, they reveal the woods outside, black against the setting sun. Real estate is still cheap out here in the boonies, but it won't be forever. A new housing development five miles down the highway hints at what's to come. 

The only lights you pass on the way to the scrapyard are set far into the trees. Tiny, falling-down homes owned by people with no interest in or capital for improvement.

A mile away from the scrapyard, the night sky begins to lighten, as if time is reversing. As you make the turn into the lot, you have to squint against the canopy of halogens.

The scrapyard is small but sprawling. Husks of refrigerators and the empty shells of cars stick out from piles of twisted metal and dirt. Some of your brother's sculptures are indistinguishable from these organic heaps. 

A cloud of insects foams around the porch light as you mount the trailer steps and enter the front office.

The wiry guy behind the desk -- a piece of sheet metal propped on cinder blocks -- stands to greet you.

""Harvey not in today?"" you ask.

""Nope,"" he replies, shaking your outstretched hand, bent over like a pipe cleaner. ""Called in sick. I've been here since ten this morning.""

""Oof, that's awful. Hopefully you get to go home soon.""

The attendant shrugs.

Your brother gets to his feet, giving you a lackadaisical smile, like this is all part of a beloved routine. 

""Sorry you had to call,"" you continue pointedly. ""I told Harvey he can trespass him any time he wants.""

""No worries. He told us what to do if Brian shows up. Gotta be nice to the folks with stuff goin’ on.""

Many people are under the impression that Brian is mentally ill. This is a reasonable assumption to make of someone who spends his time gluing trash together, but he's not. Brian just prefers what's in his head to what's outside it. He always has.

""Not like he can take much, anyway,"" the attendant continues. ""Copper's all locked up for like a year now.""

""Well, tell him I said thanks, and I hope he feels better.""

""Will do.""

You guide Brian out the door with a firm hand on his shoulder. He's taller than you -- older, too -- but it's never felt that way.

""Thanks, again.""

""You folks have a good night.""

Brian walks with his hands in his suspiciously bulging pockets. He stares at the piles of metal and pauses by the twisted hulk of a small sedan.

""Wouldn't it be great if I could take one of these? There's so much you can do with a big frame like this.""

You pull him forward by the arm, digging your fingers in.

""Ouch, dude,"" he says cheerfully.

You shove him into the back seat. He makes a quip about being demoted.

""You good?"" he asks you as you slam your seatbelt buckle into its housing.

""No, not really,"" you reply, looking over your shoulder and reversing into a turn.

""Why?""

""You know I have a life, right? That I don't exist to serve you?""

""I'm sorry,"" your brother replies, nonplussed. 

In the rearview, his head lowers as he inspects his haul.

""I have a LIFE. I'm sick of this shit. I'm telling Harvey to trespass you if he sees you there again. I'm telling EVERYONE to trespass you. I am SICK OF THIS SHIT.""

Brian turns his eyes up at you but, wisely, doesn't open his mouth again. He just sits there and plays with his toys like a child.

His house is the last on a long dirt road and is easily identifiable in the worst way. Junk metal glitters in the front yard, like a small plane crashed into the ten square feet of crispy brown lawn and disintegrated. The mangey roof sheds shingles. The garage, abandoned, is half-collapsed and leaning. If he had actual neighbors, this place would have been condemned years ago. As it is, he's just an eyesore. A directional waypoint. *If you've hit the hillbilly house, you've gone too far.*

You park on the street. You've lost enough tires to the nails and screws tossed carelessly into what passes for his driveway. 

Brian gets out and knocks on your window. You lower it but don't look at him.

""Can I show you what I've been doing?""

You light up with a surge of anger that fades just as quickly. You repeat the mantra your mom used to say whenever the two of you fought as kids:

*Don't ever go to bed angry. You never know when you'll see each other again.*

So you nod and roll up the window and kill the engine and follow your brother up his shitty driveway and into his shitty house. Spaces bleeding together, every surface used indiscriminately. He turns on lights that put out a weak nicotine glow and the two of you walk over empty bags, papers, pieces of scrap.

""For fuck's sake, it's like a bomb went off in here.""

""I gotta clean here soon,"" Brian dismisses, waving his hand. ""But here, look. Check this out.""

He opens the last door on the left and ushers you into what was once the spare bedroom. 

Twisted metal forms loom everywhere, shoved into any available space around the antique flip-top children's desk braced against the far wall. The eye can barely make sense of the visual cacophony. Wrenches and bolts and screws and an ancient soldering iron sitting on a rolling laptop stand and spools of solder and more papers and even more empty fast food bags. Who knows what kind of insect life is thriving here.

Brian weaves between the statues -- organic tangles, loops of thick metal, headlight housings, electrical cables, all smashed together the frozen second of detonation -- and picks up a small object from somewhere in the clutter. He holds it tenderly in his palms, like a small animal.

He hands it to you. You gingerly accept it. It's a crudely made hollow cube made of solid, hand-smithed pieces of metal. Only one panel of the square is solid, and it is suspiciously copper-colored.

""What metal is this?"" you ask, running your finger along it.

He ignores you. ""Look inside.""

“Can I not?”

“No, come on! Look!”

You could strangle him. But you do as instructed.

The inside of the cube is empty. The back panel is blank.

""Nice,"" you offer lamely.

Brian grins. ""Keep looking. Pay attention to the corners.""

""Dude, I want to go home.""

""No, no, just look again! Look at the corners!""

He's selfish, and he always has been. He doesn't care that your husband has been waiting for over an hour now. It never crosses his mind that you might have priorities that aren't him and his shitty art.

You look again. Nothing. It’s just metal.

Except.

You look closer.

There’s something weird about the top left corner.

You turn the cube this way and that.

Something is definitely off.

You follow the lines and discover something very strange.

""How do you have the sides overlapping like that?""

Brian's grin broadens. ""Doesn't make sense does it?""

You follow the lines again and again. It reminds you of that triangle optical illusion, where all the angles are impossible.
Except this is different. This isn't a copy of any illusion you’ve ever seen. Every time you follow a beam, you feel a sort of slipping, an almost painful flinch, and when it's over, the lines have changed. You're sure of it. You test it over and over until your eyes hurt, like you've been staring into a bright light. In fact, when you pull away, you're left with an afterimage, and even the afterimage stings something in the center of your head.

You hand the cube back a little too roughly.

""Careful! For fuck's sake!"" Brian chastises, cradling his bizarre creation.

""How did you do that?""

His face lights up with a proud smile. ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you.""

Your phone buzzes in your pocket. A text from Andrew:

*Dinner's cold. I'm going to bed.*

""I’m leaving. Andrew’s pissed.""

For the first time that evening, Brian seems genuinely remorseful.

""Sorry. I really didn't know it was that big of a deal.""

""It absolutely is.""

""I can try and do it less, if that helps.""

You don't have the time or energy for a single other second of your brother. 

Brian stands in his doorway, waving as you leave. Still cradling the cube.

The drive home sucks. You use Siri to apologize over and over, but Andrew never responds.

The house is dark when you pull in. He left your dinner on the table. It's your favorite, and it is, in fact, stone cold. You eat it standing at the kitchen counter. You clean all the dishes by hand and put them in the rack to dry. Tomorrow, you'll get Andrew a chicken burger and some coffee. You'll try to make it up to him.
You start up the stairs to the bedroom. 

But, suddenly, you're not sure you’re actually tired. Could you actually sleep right now, even if you tried? It might be better to watch something. Get sleepy that way.

You lie down on the couch and turn on a movie. You turn it up a little. The house feels oppressively quiet tonight.

Baby sleeps well at night, with a long first stretch of 7-9 hours most nights. His total night time sleep is usually 11 or 12 hours. When his night sleep improved at around 9 weeks, his daytime naps went to shit. While I'm grateful for the nights, I am really frustrated by the days.

I try to keep his wake windows at 60-100 minutes, follow his cues, try to start the nap routine before he gets overtired. I can get maybe 60 minutes if it's either a contact nap after a lot of bouncing or feeding to sleep, or wearing him and just sitting still or bouncing. If I try to transfer to crib he will sleep 5 to 10 minutes most times before screaming.

I feel like my whole day is spent doing nothing: either it's holding him while bouncing or sitting still in an uncomfortable position. My body hurts everywhere and I can't do anything for myself or in the house. This morning I spent an hour and 40 minutes putting him down, only for him to sleep 10 minutes in two stretches. Now I'm trying to rescue the nap by wearing him while I cry silently out of discomfort and frustration. I can't risk waking him by making coffee or using the bathroom.

I hate that they days are so difficult. When he's rested and content he's so cute and happy, all smiles and coos. But every active window is followed by this frustrating ridiculousness that makes me dread the day ahead. Lately even the contact naps take a long time to work, and he is sooooo tired in the late afternoon because of his shitty naps.

1h8422x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h8422x/no_christmas_eve_drunkenness_or_christmas_day/,No Christmas Eve drunkenness or Christmas Day hangover ,"Two years ago I got so drunk on Christmas Eve. We are Christmas and Easter Christians, so I was drunk at church (at noon) for one of the two times I go during the year. That part actually makes me kinda chuckle (though it absolutely shouldn’t). 

Drank through our family Christmas Eve party, and ended up so drunk that I was hungover by 11pm when my wife needed help wrapping dozens of presents and putting together dollhouses, etc. I laid in bed moaning and nursing one of the worst headaches of my life. I wanted to help but I physically couldn’t. I fell asleep at 12:30 and my wife stayed up until 2:30 finishing a job that should have been done hours ago. The memory still hurts us both! 

Woke up Christmas Day and felt so sick that I took two secret shots of whiskey at 6 AM in the kitchen before everyone woke up to be able to suffer through opening presents. Head in my hands while my kids tried to show me their presents. And of course I was as surprised to see the presents as my kids were, having participated in zero percent of the buying of said presents. 

Got through that and then poured myself a mimosa, and of course made my wife drink one. [side note: I was wondering last night how many drinks other people have drank in this world because I pushed drinks on them. Could be in the thousands. I have tons of memories of people looking at me like there was something seriously wrong with me for pushing shots of straight liquor on them. Turns out that’s super not normal drinking behavior.]

Finished the mimosas and then opened up a present of fine sampler whiskey shooters I had bought to give my brother in law, and drank them all. Passed out on the couch by ten AM and slept most the day. Brother in law came over at some point and I had no gift to exchange. 

All in all, it SUCKED. 

This year, I helped buy every present and we are already done shopping. This year, I’ll be up all night putting a trampoline together with my wife on Christmas Eve. This year, I’ll not smell like a homeless person at church. This year, I’ll savor every second of Christmas Eve and I’ll wake up Christmas Day and pound two cups of yummy coffee instead of shots. I’ll love the opening of presents, and I’ll love going outside in the morning to jump on the trampoline with my little ones. 

What the fuck was I thinking before? What drove me to believe that that first drink on Christmas Eve morning was a good idea? Alcohol is indeed cunning, baffling, and powerful. 

All those Christmas movies about how someone had to do something insane and crazy to save Christmas (Tim Allen becoming the Santa Claus, for example). All I have to do to save Christmas is NOT do something — not pour gasoline down my throat. That seems easy enough. I’m not fixing Santa’s Sleigh like Buddy the Elf for God’s sake.

As far as he knew, the undead didn’t eat animals. They were strict peoplevores; fresh, living humans only, but in all the chaos of the outbreak, most animals had made themselves scarce. Sure, there was still a squirrel or two running around the city, and plenty of birds, but it had been months since Dellany had seen a dog.

This one had light grey fur with black speckles, the color of cookies and cream, and looked like some sort of herding dog, an Australian Shepherd or something like that. Six inches of frayed, green leash hung from its collar. The dog stood on the sidewalk in front of a coffee shop, its windows smashed out, tables and chairs inside stained with dried blood.

“Hey, there,” he whispered, crouching and holding out his hand. “Who’s a good boy?”

The dog cocked its head.

Dellany slipped off his rucksack, fishing out some jerky that he had scrounged from an abandoned gas station down the street. He tore off a piece and tossed it to the dog, who gave it a quick sniff and gobbled it down.

“Who’s a good boy, huh?”

The dog turned and trotted a few yards away, stopping to regard Dellany with ice blue eyes.

“Hey, where ya going?” he cooed, creeping slowly, so as not to spook the animal.

The dog scurried further up the sidewalk. It paused for a backwards glance, before disappearing into an alley. Dellany followed. He’d never been much of an animal lover, but these last few months had been so lonely. It would be good to have a friend.

At the far end of the alley, the dog sat, tail swishing on the pavement. Dellany approached slowly, tearing off another piece of jerky. He had gotten within ten feet of the dog, whispering soothing words and assurances, when it started barking.

“No, no, no! Don’t do that!” Dellany hissed, waving his hands.

The undead couldn’t see very well. Their eyes gummed up with dirt because they never blinked. They didn’t breathe, either, so no sense of smell, but they could hear just fine. They could hear your stomach growling with hunger from a block away; Dellany knew that from personal experience. He decided he didn’t really need a friend after all. Turning to run, he found himself face to face with a zombie.

She wrapped her rotting arms around him, sinking her dirty, broken teeth into his neck, before he could react. Dellany broke free of her embrace, stumbling backward against the wall, clapping a hand to his wound. Blood squirted between his fingers and washed down the front of his shirt in waves. She’d bitten through his carotid artery. The strength went out of legs and he slid to the ground. As she dropped down to bite into his calf, Dellany noticed the other end of the frayed green leash, still looped around her decaying wrist. The dog watched her with adoring eyes.

Yeah, you’re a good boy, Dellany thought, just before the world went dark. Still loyal to your human, even though she wasn’t really human anymore.",5,1733499102.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It's funny how things you do, can end up becoming new rituals. ...*<sits down with you to have breakfast>*... Couple of years ago, I wanted to make sure I didn't need to think about food during the holiday week. I ordered 2 or 3 pizza's. ...*<nods>*... Well, that has become my thing.

How do you get a 73 year old stubborn man to stop eating your child's food and sweets and even your own food, especially when he gets more than his fair share and eats way more than anyone in this household? I'm allergic to eggs and gluten. My diet is limited and he has the audacity to eat even my special foods that is all I can eat without an allergic reaction. Talking hasn't worked, asking hasn't worked, shouting hasn't worked. I have even set one drawer in the fridge aside, just for our stuff, told him it's our stuff. If we put our left overs in the fridge to eat later that day or the next day, he will literally go and eat it out of our dishes in the fridge and just leave the empty dish inside. He is a glutton. He will finish 4 loafs of bread on his own in 2 days. 1 2ltr tub of ice cream in 20 minutes on his own, 1 kg margerine in a week. 1 kg syrup in a week. 750g coffee in 2 weeks, 2 kg sugar in 1 week all on his own, 1 pocket of potatoes in less than 2 weeks etc on his own! I am at my witts end. I can't even afford a second hand fridge to keep in my room just so he can leave our stuff alone. We eat once a day. Sometimes we even have just popcorn for dinner while he eats eggs, bread, tomatoes etc multiple times a day. When his 4 loafs of bread was finished, he stole my Rye bread and ate it. I am constantly stressed that he is going to eat my child's food. I am truly disgusted at his behavior and gluttony. We try our best to stretch meals and make everything last, while he just goes crazy finishing everything off like A stray dog that hasn't fed in months.he will finish all of his and then take ours as well. The last 2 weeks of the month there is no money and no food left. Food and money lasts only 2 weeks in this house because of him. I can't anymore and moving isn't an option right now because we have to constantly take care of him and I take care of all his medical needs etc. I can't anymore.

1h83qar,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h83qar/in_for_a_pound/,In for a Pound,"In for a pound. That was Reg’s motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn’t. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn’t for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn’t be able to. 

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone. 

But being a Dad wasn’t a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn’t have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn’t trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn’t easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn’t really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear. 

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg’s brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn’t seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn’t funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many “red flags” but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had. 

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. “What’s the big deal?” Reg had asked his brother. “Just read a book, go on your phone.” But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43. 

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with. 

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg’s help it was published posthumously. You just didn’t know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up. 

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn’t deal with. 

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he’d rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like. 

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn’t the only one, or the podcast wouldn’t be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends. 

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go. 

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn’t the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden. 

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it. 

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn’t like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn’t look like what was happening to him. 

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn’t need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life. 

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn’t need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires. 

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn’t want to let go of the nail so he couldn’t skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn’t over. 

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn’t cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm. 

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going. 

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind’s attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve. 

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He’d give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn’t trust the nail. What if it wasn’t content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn’t they know people were suffering?! Still he didn’t turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn’t bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn’t like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he’d never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth? 

Reg’s curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

“You’ve got a big surprise coming to you” he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside. 

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he’d be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place. 

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. “Please God, let most of me be intact.”He pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail. 

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn’t care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn’t be right.

“I’m weak, I can’t do it, I’m weak, I can’t do it.” He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn’t actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn’t using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart. 

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn’t have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That’s right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn’t care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life’s blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn’t care if it killed him, as long as he died free. 

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone…

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone. 

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn’t want it to crawl back inside him. He didn’t think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn’t trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose. 

That’s when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

“You’re awake.”

“Yes.” He answered weakly.

“What happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?”

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg’s resting place.

“No, a hangnail.”

Norris laughed.

“Yeah, right.” Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

“What is it, some kind of root?” Norris asked.

“Some kind,” Reg answered.

“We need to get you inside where it’s warm.” Norris said, sounding concerned.

“No,” Reg said firmly. “First we get rid of it.”

“Okay, what would you like me to do with it?”

Reg wasn’t sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn’t matter as long as they did what was necessary.

“The compost bin,” Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

“Right,” Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

“No!” Reg shouted. “For God’s sake don’t touch it.” The thing could just be playing dead. 

“Go to the shed,” Reg instructed him, “there’s another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.”

The urgency of Reg’s tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him. 

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg’s beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

“Close the lid”, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony. 

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven’s Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

“Where do you keep your bandages, Reg?”

“Upstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.”

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris’s house was twice the size of Reg’s and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris’s handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He’d been out for 4 hours. 

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn’t like it, called the hosts as “cackling ghouls”. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

“Hello”, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff’s The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

“Sorry,” she said, and embraced him more gently.

“It’s okay.”

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

“How did you know I’d be awake?” He said, glancing at the tea.

“I didn’t, I just kept making them. That’s the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

“Ow.”

“Do you think you’re in a fit state to make those comments?”

“I am,” he said smiling.

“Why didn’t you call me?” She asked, becoming serious.

“I don’t know.” And he didn’t. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

“Silly man,” she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

“Ah you’re awake.” He said. “How are those bandages holding up?”

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

“I’ll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren’t that serious, it’s your chest I’d be worried about. You should really go to A and E.”

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death’s door you’d be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn’t fancy it.

“I’ll take my chances”, he said. “I have a good nurse.”

“Suit yourself.” Norris said, shrugging. “Make sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.”

“You patched up my wounded soldier,” Lucy said to Norris. “How will I ever repay you?”

“Don’t worry,” he said, “the tea and biscuits should cover it.”

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

“Thank you,” Reg said.

“Not at all.”

“So,” Lucy said, “Norris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?”

“That’s right,” Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

“It’s true,” Norris said. “I saw it myself. It was...” He struggled to convey it. “One for the books.” This gave him an idea. “In fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I’d just have to take some pictures...”

“No,” Reg said adamantly, “no one goes near it.”

Norris retreated. “You’re the boss,” he said. “Well, the wife has been sending me texts. She’s ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.”

“Understood,” Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro. 

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

“Reg, hun, was it really a hangnail?”

“Yes,” he said, feeling indignant.

“But how did it get so big?”

“Beats me.”

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. “You believe me don’t you, Luce?”

Whether she did or not she chose to. “Yes, hun,” she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. “Remember me?” They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy’s chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand. 

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn’t the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that. 

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces. 

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.",2,1733498509.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I am estimating I might ovulate just before Christmas, meaning I will be in the dreaded two week wait while my husband and I are traveling home to visit family for two weeks. On one hand I’m happy that I’ll have lots of distractions, but I’m worried about other things that come along with the holidays - namely drinking more coffee and alcohol than I usually would. I can of course moderate this or cut it out completely, but we haven’t told family that we are actively trying for a baby and I don’t want anyone getting suspicious. Is it okay to drink caffeine and wine in moderation during the two week wait? We had a previous loss in June so I want to be extra careful. ",1,1733497958.0,TryingForABaby,8,0.6,False

Can it reach one billion market cap?,"Kendu moves like a shadow: swift and unstoppable, carving its path toward a billion-dollar market cap. With a 30% surge in just a day and its holder count rising like bamboo in the moonlight, the momentum is undeniable. But this is no ordinary meme coin: Kendu is a warrior with tools and strategies that outclass its rivals.

The Kendu Army grows stronger, fueled not only by conviction but by innovation. Beyond Ethereum, Kendu prepares to expand its reach, bridging to the Solana and Base networks. These bridges are like hidden pathways: unlocking new realms of liquidity and drawing fresh allies from Solana’s speed and Base’s rising dominance. Kendu becomes a multi-chain force, no longer confined to one battlefield.

Its arsenal extends further, with the Kenduchads NFT marketplace and payment options that allow for seamless purchases via Apple Pay and non-KYC deposits. Yet, Kendu doesn’t stop there. Its latest weapons: Kendu Energy Drinks and Kendu Coffee, tangible products that strengthen its brand while energizing its loyal warriors. This blend of digital and physical presence makes Kendu more than a token: it becomes a lifestyle.

Altcoin season has arrived, and the crypto winds are shifting in Kendu’s favor. As the market looks for bold projects with vision and versatility, Kendu stands ready to capture the spotlight. It’s not just the coin’s price that’s rising: it’s the spirit of its community, the strength of its innovation, and the relentless execution of its strategy.

A billion-dollar market cap is within reach. Kendu moves with precision: fueled by its growing community, its cross-chain expansion, and the unstoppable energy of a project that blends tradition with modern utility.

My husband (27M) and I recently moved to a new country, and it’s been a stressful time for both of us. On top of that, I was away for two weeks visiting my sick mother in another country, which added even more strain.

When I came back, my husband sat me down and confessed that he had been talking to a girl from the gym while I was gone. He was really emotional about it, almost breaking down, and said he felt terrible about the situation.

Here’s the backstory: this girl is apparently a mutual friend of the guy my husband works out with. They all exchanged numbers, and my husband said she looked “manly,” so he assumed she was gay at first. Because of that assumption, he didn’t think much of it when he agreed to go to a coffee shop with her to talk about working out and her running a marathon.

But after that, they started talking more. My husband said he treated her like a friend, didn’t initiate anything, and kept the conversations platonic. However, she apparently developed feelings for him and started pursuing him aggressively—texting a lot, trying to meet up, and telling him personal things. My husband says he felt like she was trying to push him into a relationship, which he didn’t want (she knew he was married).

Eventually, he blocked her and said he felt awful about the whole thing—especially since he thought even having those conversations with her was a mistake. He told me everything when I got back, but I’m struggling to process it.

Would you consider this an emotional affair? Or was it just an innocent situation that got out of hand? I don’t know how to feel about it, and I’d appreciate any advice.",1,1733497656.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

So you made it to December without making a Christmas list and now people are hounding you about what you want, or maybe you never know what to get people and need some ideas. Look no further, this year, I have compiled a list of suggestions, mostly of things that I love and use often, but also things that I have heard very good things about. The other mods are gonna make fun of me for this post, but thats because they don't care about you and want to suppress quality Christmas gifts. But we wont let them. So, without further ado, meet the **PartyPastor Christmas List Suggestions**.

# $25 and under

* [**Walnut Frame**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPS8GKX1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) \- (**$22**) - Need a cheaper but good looking wood frame? We needed some small frames for stuff we wanted on our walls, and this frame is absolutely amazing. Its an easy install, its plexiglass instead of real glass, and they have a bunch of sizes. The various sizes also obviously come with various prices. 
* [**Matador Gear Tags**](https://www.matadorequipment.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/gear-tags-2-pack) (**$15**) - I'm always suspicious that the moment my bag gets rained on or something my luggage tag will disintegrate and my bag will be list. I bought these luggage tags last year and they are fantastic. We've used them for about a year and theyve always traveled internationally and really held up! 
* [**Moroccan Tile Coasters**](https://www.worldmarket.com/p/terracotta-moroccan-tile-coasters-4-pack-545098.html) (**$15**) - My wife and I have had these in our house for a few years now. I really love a good blue tile, and so these 4 coasters that are super cool to use and just sit on your coffee table.
* [**Hero Clip**](https://www.amazon.com/HEROCLIP-Carabiner-Small-Stroller-Backpack/dp/B08GQJC8SV/ref=asc_df_B08GQJC8SV/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693647146532&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=227944586291864757&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012509&hvtargid=pla-1018431085640&psc=1&mcid=b0c65831898b39fa9cde36e55ef4b503) \- (**$16**) - After living in Asia, I got use to having to use the bathroom and just holding my backpack. This is a great carabiner that you can keep on your bag and use to hang your bag when youre in a place that doenst have a hook, like Asian bathrooms, or the random starbucks that someone ripped it off. My family keeps one on every backpack we own and its kept my backpack off many bathroom floors now.
* [**Doxology Hymn Print**](https://littlethingsstudio.com/product/doxology-art-print/) \- (**$15**) This creator (Little Things Studio) has some really great prints from all different hymns! I don't particularly love them, they're a little girly imo and not my style, but this one in particular is beautiful and is something we actually have set aside to take overseas with us.
* [**Owala Kids Tumbler**](https://www.amazon.com/Owala-Insulation-BPA-Free-Resistant-Dishwasher/dp/B0CNGXX8KZ/ref=asc_df_B0CNGXX8KZ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12603775535431662337&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012509&hvtargid=pla-2281435177578&psc=1&mcid=1c4fa88dfbcc3823a7a1d265d68b093c&hvocijid=12603775535431662337-B0CNGXX8KZ-&hvexpln=73) \- (**$10)** Know anyone with kids who spill everything? This was the first water bottle we bought for our baby and she throws it and drops it and holds it upside down, and obviously it has little drips, but its the most consistent water bottle for kids that doesnt just outright leak all of its contents when held upside down and shaken by a toddler. 

# $25-50

* [**Prints from The Old Try**](https://theoldtry.com/) (**$44**) - I own [this one](https://theoldtry.com/collections/letterpress-scripture/products/oh-praise) and love it, they’re owned by a believing couple in West Virginia and they wood block frame all of their prints! 
   * This [Chirpwood frame](https://chirpwood.com/collections/twostick-frames) is the one that they feature in most of the print photos and I have several of them (starting at $25)
* [**Hario V60-2**](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Dripper-White/dp/B002S01CKW/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=v60%2B2&qid=1609132922&sr=8-2&th=1) \- (**$29**) Want to get into coffee but don't know where to start? Here you go. I use this every single day and love it. Here is a good starter [video from James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oB1oDrDkHM) on how to do it! 
* [**Large Travel Tray**](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/travel-tray?variant=41975661527229) **from Tom Bihn** (**$28**) - Does anyone else not always know how to empty their pockets when traveling? I used to empty them into an upside down hat. So now, I use this all the time when I travel. Its my catchall in the hotel, its helpful in the airport so my stuff isnt falling on the ground. 10/10 recommend
* [**Anker Charging Station**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D12KTDKT?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) \- (**$26**) sometimes you just want something practical and no nonsense. I actually just bought this and I absolutely love it for plugging in a few things up under my bed and it not feeling as cluttered and can charge quickly.
* [**Lord of Maps Print**](https://lordofmaps.com/) **($27)**\- Obsessed with LOTR? Me too. This guy makes state and country maps in the style of Tolkien's maps. I own the North Carolina one and I really love it. I know there are a few prints on here but I think they're good gift ideas.
* [**Owala Water Bottle**](https://www.amazon.com/Owala-FreeSip-Insulated-Stainless-BPA-Free/dp/B0C59BVJ3N/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8SJD4Z56SZN0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6eQQXRvioEvKolDsBZAisRmRnJelF5tFONQLKznw_4QYUyGE4RW5GI-GzEbWaaldRVPa_WCIqTPkYLyYSPz9CR3V2FomAt3LvxFbt-S4Ad2Goh5VXZ4bnaZ59Ou4RNJ76JskLhkKpLDfY4UOjxvYfr9r9OkSqKglmFiBbm5ZI8LLz3HhdtdEf7kkX2lIkoA1vUqaRy6CWTmX0JxMlb3mcIzBKKA27U1HfnwQOpYaOEcYFhEEJ8qup_LTXg_UmVVdefM0F26gcdMSIVA1xfEIGdOhEgxmvI_L6oyE8ORKic8.lN1O-xzKrOJxpk5VHzP1LbxpsY5J6gCOR0FoqVdc8j4&dib_tag=se&keywords=owala%2Bboba%2Bfett&qid=1728598610&s=home-garden&sprefix=owala%2Bboba%2Bfet%2Cgarden%2C125&sr=1-1&th=1) \- (**$33**) I really love this, I know that water bottles come in fads and this is just the current fad, but this a really handy water bottle. My only complaint is that the loop to hold it doesnt feel the most solid but its never broken 
* [**Matador Toiletry Bottles**](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/flatpak-toiletry-bottle-3-pack?variant=44791790502209) \- (**$38**) Second time I am linking Matador on this list and its worth it. These are hands down the best shampoo/body wash travel bottles that I have ever owned. They do not leak, they do not break, they fit easier with other things because of their shape and material. For those who have no hair and only need one, they have a single option for **$14** there. 
* [**Patagonia Dop Kit**](https://www.patagonia.com/product/black-hole-packing-cube-3-liters/49362.html) \- (**$40**) If you dont have a good Dop Kit for travel, this one is great. Its slim, but spacious, it is water resistant so if you always worry about stuff spilling on the inside, it wont come out into the rest of your stuff. 
* [**East Fork Mug**](https://www.eastfork.com/products/east-fork-mug) \- (**$44**)  This is the most amazing mug. If you’re looking for a great ceramic mug for coffee, this thing keeps it hot for a while, feels good on your hand, and is good looking imo. They are out of Asheville so buying something from this actually helps support employees who live there. I use this mug every day. 
* [**One Year Subscription of National Geographic**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/subscribe/topic/natgeo?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=cpc::src=google::cmp=evergreen24::add=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5Bm0t5mRWa5io8NWWcdHNGb-XhxjCn0QeDuH-em00kogc6ENk6mKCsxoCazsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) (**$49**) - this should be obvious what it is but its a fun one.

# $50-100

* [**Anker Charging Block**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W2H224F/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) (**$70**) - I got this before our North Africa trip and it will charge my laptop, my phone, my kindle, all on one charge and it has quite a few charges in it. 
* [**Gravel Travel Blanket**](https://www.graveltravel.com/?tw_source=google&tw_adid=408287522132&tw_campaign=8698322819&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5Bo-q3ca_D2chw_Y1Q-KbNlTQUZmeN8u8QsJnFsM3HuW0lTGD6e5Z1hoCMf0QAvD_BwE) \- (**$100**) - I used an [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QR8LJDF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Gift card to buy this before our North Africa trip and we used it a ton. 
* [**Vuori Shorts**](https://vuoriclothing.com/products/kore-short-black?queryId=45debfd7e565fea2571458146c84aa91&collection=mens) \- (**$68**) - Finally getting some clothing recs. These are some amazing shorts, they might be my favorite athletic shorts I have ever owned. The ""netting"" isn't net, its a genuinely comfortable almost underwear thats part of the shorts. 
* [**Freefly Hoodie**](https://freeflyapparel.com/products/mens-bamboo-lightweight-hoodie-fatigue?srsltid=AfmBOooD54_IoFfvjI0jaKCvqxxx4scEETrdT1EC3Fmrksiz7nTKGKtR) \- (**$68**) - a super lightweight bamboo hoodie for being out in the sun, but its also good for the slightly cool 60-70 degree weather (sorry non-Americans) where you don't actually want a fulllsweatshirt. I actually wore it this morning at the farmers market. 
* [**Enderly Coffee Subscription**](https://www.enderlycoffee.com/product/copy-of-gift-subscription-6-months) (6 months) - (**$84**) - this is my favorite coffee, maybe in all of North America. Their Ethiopia is perhaps the best coffee ever, and so this could make a good gift to ask for.
* [**Double Gauze Button Down**](https://huckberry.com/store/flint-and-tinder/category/p/83513-double-gauze-utility-shirt) \- (**$64**) - This is a solid button down shirt that fits well, is quality made, and has a good look to it. 
* [**Still Novel Photo Prints**](https://www.stillnovel.com/) \- (**$65+**) - Want a less traditional way to display wedding/travel/baby photos? Still Novel does cool prints for weddings, travel, babys, etc. Its got like a photo and then info on there. We have a wedding one and a baby one.

# $100-150

I realized all my issues are synchronized where they all tie into each other, so no matter how much effort i put its not going to work.

Now i just say FUCK it and let the universe do what it do. I dont even care, but what i dont get is what is the point of it all?

This entity, because it surely is an entity what is it trying to show me? "" I imagine  this entity is  like haha ha i rule you your nothing"" So im like fuck it you got it.

Another question i  have is when people say you créate your reality. It sounds cliche to me is it the décisions you make? 

Because i dam sure dont have any super power, But i have a feeling that the inner world is my dreams . Since i was young i was always able to leave my body.

Most people when they dream they have no control over it. My dream im fully aware and can move around like in waking reality.

But whenever i smoke weed and drink coffee my dreams stop, its no coïncidence that these are MY démons in this life. Im talking about cigarettes and coffee.

Thats why i do thèse things because im running from who i can be because its scary.

And why do people on this reddit answer questions in riddles? Its almost like you guys are npcs that dont want to tell me anything.

Starting to think im jesus in the bible because of this.

He has also cooked me dinner multiple times at his house. With this everytime I have gone over to see him - he has a high sex drive so it happens every time. We communicate like every second day. 

Since it’s only new we have sort of discussed about sleeping with other people and both parties have said we aren’t sleeping with anyone but each other. However he still has hinge and tinder. My town is quite small & I asked about it & he said that it has maxed out about everyone in the town. 
He is quite honest with me & when I ask questions he has no reason to lie. When we first spoke he told me his intentions (want a long term relationship). I re asked him about a week later & his response was that he had already told me & it would depend if we are compatible. 

I guess my question is based on what I’ve said what do you think this person’s intentions are? I think because I am quite young I am still in a younger mindset of male intentions and the dating game.

I am sad that I can’t “be normal” and have a present and future with parties and charcuterie boards and wine nights with friends! It’s true I long for that normalcy, but it’s also such a small part of my actual life. I drink at home on my own usually, and disconnect from reality and my amazing life to wallow in the old one. I’m anxious and traumatized and have a mood disorder and ocd. So it’s such a lie but a big part of what is “normal” in my day dream. Anyway, interesting how that normal was never mine so it’s never been mine to miss. Other than missing life as a normal girl. Then I wonder…how many of those normal women are actually struggling and feel like shit every morning, too. That with that social normal really comes the normal I feel in the mornings when I’m hungover. That the way I feel is actually normal. Mindfuck.

I drink 72-80 oz of water a day, at least once a day with electrolytes. I take a half a daily dose of a good multivitamin, plus CoQ10, fish oil, and Vitamin D every day. I use a fiber supp in my first cup of coffee and collagen supp most days in my second cup.

Most people switch on to this from an SSRI, and then say they feel awful week 1… but a week without an SSRI that you’re been on will give you really bad withdrawal that does feel awful. So it’s probably because of that.

\- Within an hour or two of climbing (bouldering) 

\-Hiking nearby with some elevation. There is plenty of walking around in Michigan but no elevation to speak of

\- Cute downtown with coffee shops/bakery/restaurants/etc.

\- Maybe University town or close by? Husband has masters in exercise science/outdoor leadership and would need to find a job so that's likely our best option

Open to east coast or west coast (probably not south. We love Chattanooga but definitely don't fit in with the politics of the south)

Thank y'all for that!

I'm no longer obsessing over ratios as gospel. Stopped fussing over the 18 in, 36 out in 30 seconds ""rule."" Focusing more on the dose amount (I was probably dosing too much, because the group head would usually be covered in coffee afterwards.) I'm pulling shots longer to get something that tastes better to me. 

I'm no longer making super sour shots that are completely undrinkable. I can make a decent espresso I can actually drink, I just don't find it delicious yet.

When I go to local coffee shops, my go-to is usually an iced Americano or a cappuccino/flat white. And I've had some really good ones with a bit of sweetness and some almost fruity notes that make me think ""wow that's a really good coffee!"" And that's what I'm chasing after. At best it'll taste like very cloudy water, and at worst it'll have a pretty astringent aftertaste. And my milk drinks usually just taste like hot milk with barely a hint of coffee flavor.

I'm fine drinking the espresso I make cuz I'm just experimenting and taking notice of what I like and don't like, but I'm nowhere near confident enough to make something for someone else to drink yet. At the moment, I can still make better coffee on my drip machine.

Here's what I've been doing lately.
* Darker roasted beans (fresh, whole bean, single dosed instead of from the hopper) 
*Dose at around 16-17 grams
*Grind size on SGP at around 7-8
*Still doing plenty of WDT and doing my best to get an even tamp. 
* Brew temp at about 95C
*Added a 5 second pre-infusion time.
* Brew until I get roughly 2oz (56g) of espresso (by weight, not volume)

Shots brew nice for the most part. Good looking, foamy crema. It's just the taste I'm not quite happy with.

Is my issue that the Breville Smart Grinder Pro just can't go fine enough? I bought it recently to replace an old grinder that broke and I was specifically looking to upgrade to a grinder rated for espresso. But maybe it's just too much of a budget machine. I can't go any finer than grind size 7 without starting to choke the machine. Only about size 9 if it's a lighter roast. So if the problem is I truly can't grind fine enough, then I'm shit out of luck for now. That was already a big recent purchase for my budget.

Or is it pre-infusion time?
Or water temperature?
Or something else?

There are quite a few of these posts on Reddit (don't worry I did read through most of them for ideas already!) but I wanted to post this anyway in case anyone has ideas specific to my husband, or just other info that will be useful to me (I'm pretty new to this!)

He listens to a bunch of RPG podcasts, he has played before, and he has been a GM once or twice. He has played DnD, but I think he prefers Pathfinder, and now he's talking about some remastered version.  He usually plays online, but he's about to start a tabletop game with some friends and this will be his first in-person game. I've never seen him this excited about something before I so want to get him a bunch of stuff that will be fun and helpful for his campaign.

I just don't have enough experience to know what's what, but it sounds like some GM gifts apply to RPG in general and aren't necessarily specific to one of those games (dnd vs pathfinder). Any advice or suggestions are appreciated!

Here's what he already has: a couple battle maps with grid lines, and some little figurines of monsters but they look pretty cheap, and he has a million dice (I usually get him some awesome dice as a present - ivory, bone, metal, something pretty with resin) and yes I'll probably get him one more set this time too.  

Here's what he doesn't want: art. I see a lot of suggestions in other threads to commission a mini of his favorite character, or some kind of painting, or printed shirts/bags/etc. I don't think he's interested in stuff unless he can use it during the game! (He does steal my favorite coffee mug a lot though, so I'd be open to mug suggestions).

And here's the stuff that I came up with for him:

A DM screen (recommendations please! What makes a good screen? Are these game specific?)

A bag for all his dice, or dice storage. I'm crafty so I could sew a bag for him, but those neat storage trays look so cool.  How do you all prefer to store your dice? 

As mentioned, I'll get him one more set this year, but he also just likes dice. What's your favorite D20 shaped object? A d20 mug? A d20 jewelry box? 

Trackers - I ordered some wooden tokens, and I'll write/draw on them so he can give them to players to track what happened (confusion, fell over, etc). I like this idea of having things that represent what's going on in the game,  I saw little potions bottles online that were really cute so I might do something like that.  And spell scrolls.  Any other similar ideas? I don't know enough about what happens in this game!

I also think those little statues are cute, but I don't know what his players are. Are there standard monsters that could apply to multiple games? Like, are there dragons in DnD, Pathfinder 2e, and this new remastered Pathfinder, so he could have a dragon figurine that would be useful more than once? Or ogres or whatever? The ones he has now came with the battle maps and are cardboard and cheap and easily fall out of that little plastic base. 

An initiative tracker (any ideas on how to home make this? Also, is this even a useful item or is Etsy just trying to sell me stuff?) Similar question, something for his players to track their HP. 

A journal? This was recommended a lot - is it useful? Can he use it from campaign to campaign or would he need a new one for each new game? 


Wow, I'm sorry this turned out so long, but if you made it to the end thank you, and please help!!! I have the best husband ever, I just want to get him something great!

But fuck, sucks having to wake up this early.

My job would be so much easier if everything was polished by the dishwashers, but the owners love to cut corners around here. If it wasn’t for the head chef, this place would sure as hell not be as successful. 

I actually ended up beefing with one of the dishwashers. I don’t like her ass at all, she’s old, she’s weird, always staring at me weird, she’s got some problems going on.

She stole the fucking cart my uncle was going to use, dude had his shit and the food we were going to serve on there, and that bitch really moved it aside as if it was free. We take carts pretty serious as fuck around here, we always got to hide some after our shifts so that no one takes it. Anyways, I grabbed onto the fucking cart, she gave me a dirty look, I gave her one back. She backed off; I know, I probably should’ve let it go since she’s older, but I’d rather have her upset than have my uncle bitching at me over it. Old people need to be humbled more though, being old doesn’t give you a reason to be an ass. 

We had the buffet ready on time. My uncle watched and replenished the buffet while I was cleaning up after the group. Them scrambled eggs looked kinda dry, but that didn’t stop anyone from eating them. I’ll never get how people could put ketchup in them, I get hot sauce, but ketchup? Same people who can only eat steak with sauce I bet. 

That same dishwasher from earlier was starting to complain with me as I brought the dirty dishes from breakfast. Talking about how some, “*I’m not ready for this!*” I just kept stacking up dirty dishes into the pit. I couldn’t care less of what she has to say, I got a job to do. Then she complains more, but she does it under her breath and while my back is turned. Now, that shit pissed me off. If you’re gonna bitch about me then stand on it and do it in front of me.

Anyways, I helped my uncle set up the lunch buffet we’d have in a few hours. Also got the dining room all clean and prepped once again. I then polished all the silverware and worked on rolling it up for the next day. My uncle would later try to explain how that was a break for me later in the day… Had a brief argument with him about that, but we then continue working like nothing happened. Happens quite a lot here.

The lunch part of the day went alright, I’m just happy I wasn’t stuck on soup duty, which my brother was on. Our manager said she was going to tell him, but she had completely forgot about it once it was time. I did end up spilling some nasty shit all over my vest and hands. Whenever something like that happens, I have to clean myself up. I can’t focus on doing my job when I have shit on me. 

I had a sense of dread as I brought my cart full of dirty dishes into the kitchen. I knew I was right to feel that way once that old bat started crying over me and saying shit under her breath about me. I gave her this glare because she was pushing me badly. I shouted some things in Español at her that I probably shouldn’t have in hindsight. But I meant those words at the time. Most of the time, my inner thoughts are in English. But instinctively or when I’m mad, it’s Spanish. She did shut up though.

The two meals were really the only thing to worry about today, so I took an actual break once we finished cleaning everything up. I knew not to take it in the break room once I saw all the housekeepers in there, some of them would end up making conversation with me or watch their loud ass Facebook feed. Hell no. Going to spend every minute in peace. Shit, sometimes I’d act like I’m using the bathroom, and I’m just on my phone.

My uncle sent me home not long afterward because there really wasn’t much to do. They only had to clean up the meeting space the group was in once they get to break. The good thing about these kinds of shifts is just chilling once you’re done with the other shit. Just running the clock until the group leaves so you could clean up and head home. I wasn’t trying to run the clock though, I wanted to get as much relaxation until I deal with another 4:35 alarm tomorrow. 

I walked in to my house to see my father and his partner decorating the Christmas tree. The thing about our tree is that it’s three feet tall. I kinda felt like we needed an upgrade cause I felt some shame over it. So I offered that I’d pay for a new one, I kinda played myself upon realizing that they wanted to leave right now to go check for trees. That means less time for me to rest before the work day.

We checked Menards. I was impressed with the prices that they had one the sales floor. The tags on them mention how they were being sold for cheap, that’s the only part I was focused on. We found a nice tree that was 7 feet tall that lit up, it was $100! I was like, “Holy shit, what a good deal!” I found the nearest employee and told him how I was interested In buying the tree. I then felt stupid once he explained that we wouldn’t able to get tree until the 21st of December… They do this shit so that they could keep it in the sales floor until then. Ain’t that some bullshit. I also felt pretty stupid since it was clear on the tag that it wouldn’t be able to picked up until then. Upon seeing the prices on the trees without discounts… we got the hell out of there. 

I don’t know why the two of them wanted to head to Hobby Lobby afterwards. Their Christmas tree selection was ass, we knew to call it a day once we saw that they were selling ‘em for $400. Paying more for $200 for a decent tree, this shit is all a scam. You have to buy decorations and ornaments after that too… I embraced the little tree after that. 

Once we got back home, finally had a shower, I needed that shit. Honestly can’t even remember what happened to my day after that, that’s why I prefer to write this shit down during the day of. If I have a shift longer than 8 hours, I don’t have anymore productivity in me that day. I was knocked out before 10, haven’t slept that early in so long.

1h82gwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1h82gwy/is_this_ghosting/,Is this ghosting?,"32M has been talking to 29F for one month. She has been open since the beginning that she isn't a big texted, I acknowledge and respect that. 

Date 1- 3 hour coffee date with enthusiastic conversation 

Text every couple days with phone call once the following weekend

Date 2- 3 hour dinner date with enthusiastic conversation 

Text every couple days 

Date 3- 9 hour hangout with multiple fun and pre planned (by me activities) ends in romantic kiss.

She texts me expressing how much fun she had 

Date 4- She comes to my place for long conversation, ends in sex

Next day she texts me, reaffirms interest. We text every 2 days until that weekend 

Date 5- Another fun day, we spend longer than anticipated together. She lets slip how mych she likes me in an anecdote. Romantic kisses throughout, she tells me we can't have sex until her cycle passes, I respect her wishes and bid her a farewell kiss. 

She goes out to bar that evening, texts me at 3am expressing how grateful she is to me. 

She text the next day (sunday), she says she is too busy to visit doing laundry before a busy work week. I understand and respect that. 

She texts me Monday asking where I work, since a coworker was asking. I tell her. Have a very respectable job.

Haven't heard from her since Monday. I've always known that when a woman wants to speak to you, she will contact you. I haven't reached out in fear of her mistaking me checking in for the stinky cologne of desperation. 

Truth be told, I'm fine with not hearing from her. She expressed her lack of interest in texting and it makes our phone calls more interesting to not text app day every day. 

However, this a disruption in the pattern. I'm curious whether I should reach out and empathize over a busy work week to gage interest, or just let her come to me. 

We've had a great connection, and I know people aren't always so forthcoming. This stinks of getting ghosted to me. Curious what strangers think. ",2,1733495052.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False
1h82g81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1h82g81/my_w_trek_and_chile_experience/,My W trek and Chile Experience ,"Here is my W trek and Chile experience, with a lot of info I do not see included in other posts. 

Key takeaways from Santiago and Valparaiso

Most places take credit card, but it's a good idea to have some cash for souvenirs. 

Ubers are very cheap, $3-$10 dollars. We ubered from the airport, you can take a taxi but make sure to negotiate the price before you leave the airport. I took taxis in Santiago, and they always said the price was based on the meter. Make sure they turn on the meter! If they don't, ask them again ""Cuanto cuesta?"" and when they point at the meter its a key giveaway they didn't turn it on. 

  
You have to go to Fuente Alemana for a typical Chilean sandwich, with Mayo! Anthony Bourdain went there, and if its good enough for Anthony, its good enough for me! Los Rapidos in the old town for Empanadas! Best Empanada of the trip, and very cheap. Food is reasonably priced. $20-25 entrees, drinks are $4-8. A lot of the wine is from Chile, even if its a Cabernet. The typical Chilean wine is Camenere.

Santa Lucia Hill was cool, and easy to walk up. Cerro San Cristobal gives you views of the city, but you have to pay and wait in line for a Gondola, Santa Lucia gives you the same idea. The Art museum that is free is definitely not worth it, just trust me on this one. I wish I went to the Museum of Memory and Human Rights to learn about the dictatorship. 

  
We stayed in Las Condes region in Santiago, which is very modern, clean, safe, and beautiful. This is the business district with nice hotels. The old part of Santiago near the government buildings and museums is similar to what you can expect to a lot of Latin American cities. It's a little rougher, but I still felt safe. You can find a lot of good restaurants on Eater.com. We went out in Bellavista, which is apparently rough, but I felt safe. The nightclubs are Northeast of the city, in the Las Condes region. 

  
If you are missing any hiking gear, Decatholon is a great store with very reasonable prices. It's in every mall. 

  
Valparaiso is a cute city, but not sure if it's totally worth it if you are short on time. Reserve your busses beforehand, we had to get luck and pay an Uber driver in cash (not through the app) to drive us back. It turned out to be fun as he gave us the Aux and drove quickly, but we were stressed about getting home before that happened. The walking tour was trash, and from talking with other people, theirs was also trash, especially people who booked the tour through tripadvisor which included the bus there and back. 

If you want to do a self guided walking tour around the street art area, google ""Escalera de Colores"" in maps and that is the general area of the street art. It's an area full of painted buildings, cute little shops and boutiques and cafes. 

  
Key takeaways from Puerto Natales and the W trek.

I flew Latam and booked my flights 5 months in advance. I was given 2 price options, for Chileans, and foreigners. Choose to go through the [Latam.CL](http://Latam.CL) website, not .com, and you will get the Chilean prices. They are much cheaper, and you can use the google translate feature on Chrome to figure it out. Put all you info as you normally would, and it'll be fine. 

Taxi from the airport into town is $8, uber is a little cheaper but there are taxis waiting outside of the airport.  On the return trip, don't get to the airport too early, it is very small and you will get through everything quickly. People I know flew Sky Airlines back, and they did not care about the size of their hiking backpacks used as carryons. 

Book your busses to Torres Del Paine in advance, they do sell out. Uber to the bus, its a long walk from town.

We ate at La Disqueria and Los Asadores in Puerto Natales, and just wow! If you like your steak medium rare, you should order Medium because medium rare comes out as rare. 

  
There is a supermarket you can buy last minute food at for the hike, but we brought most of our's from home. 

  
W trek tips and tricks. 

There are two camping companies for the Refugios, Las Torres and Vertice. Las Torres runs much nicer and cleaner facilities, including the bathrooms and showers. We got the tents at Las Torres (stayed in Chileno and Frances). They are the tents that go on top of your car, and are legit, and their entire floor is padded. We got the shared room at Paine Grande (Vertice) which is recommended as the area is very very very windy and the tents do not seem comfortable. The sleeping bags and pads at Vertice were reported as crusty.... the bed is a much better idea, which is 3 bunk beds. All electricity is cut off from 11PM to 6AM if staying indoors... so be prepared for that, and bring a headlamp to the bathroom. 

Each Refugio has a full bar, and some sandwiches and pizza you can buy. The pizza at Frances sucked, but I was hungry. The pizza at Paine Grande was awesome. You must drink the Calafate beer, it is the shit. 

Each Refugio also has boiling hot water, SPF 50 sunscreen, and some Frances even had free coffee.

Looking back, we would have not brought sleeping pads. I am not sure if we would've brought a stove considering there was free hot water. At Paine Grande the hot water is in the room for pre-ordered dining, and there is a separate building for cooking with a stove, so you may want to bring a stove, or ask someone nicely to use theirs. 

  
Pre-ordered food:

Everyone said the breakfast was comical. We brought oatmeal and were very satisfied with out choice.

The lunches are big sandwiches with some other snacks and fruits. People said they wish they brought some mayo and mustard packets to spruce up their sandwiches, but were overall pleased.

The dinners seemed nice, soup and protein with grains. However, depending on when you checkin to Las Torres refugious, you may need to wait several hours for dinner... Paine Grande had a buffet cafeteria style dinner, which seemed like everyone ate at one hour. 

Our food:

Oatmeal for breakfast

Peanut Butter and Jelly Tortilla burritos for lunch

Backpacking meals for dinner supplemented by pizza!

DO NOT LISTEN to the distances on the maps, they are lies! However, most of the maps do have time estimates, which tend to be very accurate. So trust the times, not the kilometers. What even is a kilometer?

We took the first boat from Grey back to Hotel Grey. The second and third boats got cancelled due to weather, and people had to hike all the way back from Grey to Paine Grande and take the Cataraman from there. I would've cried having to hike an extra 7 miles. The weather didn't even seem bad, just a lot of wind, but that cancels the boats I guess. The boat from Grey goes by 3 glaciers on the lake, the boat to Grey just goes straight to Grey (if you are doing West to East). 

The trail is very crowded, especially to Las Torres. It gets less crowded further on, but still quite a few people. 

Our Itinerary:

Day 1: Took the 7AM bus from Puerto Natales to the park. Buy your park entrance tickets ahead of time. Took a second bus for $4.50 to Central from the entrance, and hiked to Chileno, dropped off packs and switched to day packs, and hiked to Las Torres and Back. Total hiking time of 6-7 hours. We thought about doing the morning sunrise hike to Las Torres the next day, but we were glad we did not. If someone asks you to pay for the bathroom in Chileno, tell them you are camping and save yourself $2. 

Day 2: Hike from Chileno to Frances (can also stay in Cuernos if you get that reservation). Bueatiful day! Great views! I thought this would be boring, but I was so wrong. The path has a lot of rocks, so it is not easy hiking, but mostly flat. Total hike time about 7 hours including stops.

Day 3: Hike from Frances to Italiano, about 30 minutes, switched to day packs, hiked to Britannico and back (about 4.5 hours) and then hiked from Italiano to Paine Grande (about 2.5 hours). Britannico is much better than Las Torres, in my opinion. You can also go to Mirador Frances and not all the way to Britannico if you don't have the energy, but Britannico is the view you want. 

Day 4: Hike from Paine Grande to Grey. Total hike time about 3.5 hours, it is very very windy. (It's easier to do West to East and hike with the wind, if you so choose, but its not like the wind is impossible to hike against.) Because our boat left at 11am, we had to hike early and were not able to do the suspension bridges after Grey (about 4 hours round trip), but also the later boats were cancelled. If you really want to do the suspension bridges hiking East to West I suggest staying a night in Grey (same kind of sleeping situation as Paine Grande). We got dropped off by the boat, and had to walk 30 minutes to a cafeteria. We thought we could eat at Hotel Grey, but it was for guests only. If you want to take the bus back from here, choose Administracion (the cafeteria) and not Hotel Grey, its the pick up spot just after Hotel Grey. Our regret was we bought bus tickets too late, and had to wait 5 hours at the cafeteria. The boat ride takes 1.5 hours, and you can totally make the 2PM bus from administracion. Our bus at 5:30 PM did not get to Puerto Natales until 10:15 PM. 

My favorite part of the trip was meeting people from all over the world, you tend to run into the same people that start the day you do. If you are a legit backpacker, this is totally glamping. Many people used 40L backpacks and were totally fine. We had amazing weather, and all got sunburnt. But it can rain and snow at any time, so pack accordingly.

When we first discussed it, while booking the holiday, I shrugged it off as it would cost far more to take her away in the school holidays.

I've got myself a little wound up about it today though. Out of the blue we got a week's notice before the start of term that there had been an issue with asbestos being disturbed during some work in the summer. The school offered remote learning for the first week while they get an alternative site arranged, which wasn't possible as both myself and my partner work full time so we had to put her in a nursery at a significant cost to ourselves. We did raise the concern that she would be behind in starting the new year but the school said not to worry everyone will be caught up.

Feels like the justification for these fines doesn't matter when the shoes on the other foot and there is no right of appeal.

The alternative site is makeshift at best and hot meals have been swapped for ham butties and an apple. 

I know I'll get criticised as childish for this but does anyone have any ideas to make the school and council squirm? I'll pay the fines as I don't fancy getting prosecuted l but fair is fair , shouldn't the school or council be fined for the kids missing a week of school too? 

With rise in food costs , our mortgage,  car insurance etc etc I'm really starting to get more and more angry about how much young families are being screwed in this country. We are 36 and I am so thankful we are not in our early 20s trying to start a family and buy a house in the current climate. I know this is turning in to an unhinged rant but if I hear one more boomer say about drinking coffee and netflix while expecting me to subsidise winter fuel allowances and fake farmers inheritance tax, I think I'm going to lose my mind.

We never had a conversation about how i feel about him watching porn, it just never came to my mind. I might’ve had the thought before but i probably ignored it bc i didn’t want to get hurt. Well, now here i am dealing with it. When he initially told me, i crashed out. I had an episode, i threw my coffee mug on the wall and i started hitting myself and threatening to cu+ myself. I was obviously very upset about it, i didn’t know how to deal with it i just knew i was upset. 

once i calmed down a little bit, he communicated how it isn’t as deep as im making it out to be.(like always lol) he said he watches it when he wanted to bust a nut. he doesn’t look for certain categories, he also said he doesn’t get turned on by the women on it? idk how he explained it but smth like that. He said he thinks about us and the times we had sex. He said it’s about watching the behavior of it. He doesn’t watch it too often either, he said weeks or months in between. i wish i can remember everything he said, I h8 how my brain forgets all of the details of what he said and i can only remember the general feeling i got from the conversation and that feeling was like “okay it’s not that bad we can get through this”

he felt very bad about it, he started crying because he knew he hurt me. i said it’s okay and he says no it’s not. i know he’s not a bad person and i know he doesn’t have any malicious intentions. i know he isn’t a horny dog that would fuck anything with a hole. i know he’s a very caring and sweet genuine guy. so i feel like i can meet him half way and understand without shaming him for it because i guess i understand. i understand the concept of watching p0rn. i try understanding the root of my pain from this. It hurts and i have a bit of a heavier heart but i know we can work through it and i know i may be able to get over it. i think him being an amazing boyfriend and giving me cuddles and shit helps heal me. i’m trying my best not to fall into a spiral from this, i don’t want to go through weeks of ruminating on this. i want us both to be happy. i don’t have a therapist to talk to about all this but i really wish i do. because i need genuine advice on how to go on about this.

I'm here because I need help thinking of gifts for my husband! There are quite a few of these posts on Reddit (don't worry I did read through most of them for ideas already!) but I wanted to post this anyway in case anyone has ideas specific to my husband, or just other info that will be useful to me (I'm pretty new to this!)

He listens to a bunch of RPG podcasts, he has played before, and he has been a GM once or twice. He has played DnD, but I think he prefers Pathfinder, and now he's talking about some remastered version.  He usually plays online, but he's about to start a tabletop game with some friends and this will be his first in-person game. I've never seen him this excited about something before I so want to get him a bunch of stuff that will be fun and helpful for his campaign.

I just don't have enough experience to know what's what, but it sounds like some GM gifts apply to RPG in general and aren't necessarily specific to one of those games (dnd vs pathfinder). Any advice or suggestions are appreciated!

Here's what he already has: a couple battle maps with grid lines, and some little figurines of monsters but they look pretty cheap, and he has a million dice (I usually get him some awesome dice as a present - ivory, bone, metal, something pretty with resin) and yes I'll probably get him one more set this time too.  

Here's what he doesn't want: art. I see a lot of suggestions in other threads to commission a mini of his favorite character, or some kind of painting, or printed shirts/bags/etc. I don't think he's interested in stuff unless he can use it during the game! (He does steal my favorite coffee mug a lot though, so I'd be open to mug suggestions).

And here's the stuff that I came up with for him:

A DM screen (recommendations please! What makes a good screen? Are these game specific?)

A bag for all his dice, or dice storage. I'm crafty so I could sew a bag for him, but those neat storage trays look so cool.  How do you all prefer to store your dice? 

As mentioned, I'll get him one more set this year, but he also just likes dice. What's your favorite D20 shaped object? A d20 mug? A d20 jewelry box? 

Trackers - I ordered some wooden tokens, and I'll write/draw on them so he can give them to players to track what happened (confusion, fell over, etc). I like this idea of having things that represent what's going on in the game,  I saw little potions bottles online that were really cute so I might do something like that.  And spell scrolls.  Any other similar ideas? I don't know enough about what happens in this game!

I also think those little statues are cute, but I don't know what his players are. Are there standard monsters that could apply to multiple games? Like, are there dragons in DnD, Pathfinder 2e, and this new remastered Pathfinder, so he could have a dragon figurine that would be useful more than once? Or ogres or whatever? The ones he has now came with the battle maps and are cardboard and cheap and easily fall out of that little plastic base. 

An initiative tracker (any ideas on how to home make this? Also, is this even a useful item or is Etsy just trying to sell me stuff?) Similar question, something for his players to track their HP. 

A journal? This was recommended a lot - is it useful? Can he use it from campaign to campaign or would he need a new one for each new game? 


Wow, I'm sorry this turned out so long, but if you made it to the end thank you, and please help!!! I have the best husband ever, I just want to get him something great!

Two weeks ago, I was scrolling through Play Store, looking for a decent alarm clock app.

The native app on my smartphone wasn’t bad, but it lacked the one tool I desperately needed: interactive alarms.

I have a job lined up in January requiring me to wake up at an ungodly hour to catch a 6:30 a.m. local train. I can’t afford to hit snooze and sleep through a cascade of alarms.

My search was proving futile, though. Every app came with either ‘contains ads’ or ‘in-app purchases,’ or both. I’m not against developers making money, but 5 US dollars? For an alarm app? Ridiculous.

Frustrated, I turned to Google and searched: 'free alarm apps reddit'. After scrolling through ancient posts, I found a recent discussion from four months ago. That’s when I saw *that* comment:


>Hi. I’ve developed a versatile timekeeping app with features like nightstand mode, interactive alarms, and voice commands.

>I plan to publish it using a freemium model,  but here’s the deal: anyone who installs the app and creates an account by 22^nd November, 2024, will get ALL features—including future updates—completely free. Forever.

>Here’s the ‘link’. Please share it.

>Only for Android users.


*22^nd November? That’s today!*

I thought anxiously as I glanced at the time—6:13 p.m. What if I missed the window? I scrolled further, hoping for reviews. Nothing. The comment stood alone, unacknowledged. Torn between scepticism and excitement, I decided to take the risk.

*What’s the worst that could happen?*

The link redirected me to Google Drive, where I found a `.docx` file. It contained another link and FTP credentials. My thumb hovered over the link. Something felt off, but I tapped it and entered the login details. My access was authenticated.

The server opened to a folder of APK files. My phone threw up half a dozen warnings as I downloaded it. Each time, I hit 'Proceed Anyway', ignoring the knot in my stomach. Finally, the installation was complete.

_________________________________________________


The app—**Time**—was incredible. Its interface was a technophile’s dream: sleek black backgrounds with glowing neon purple accents.

What set it apart immediately was its sign-up process. No demands for a mobile number or an email address—just a simple username and password. Perfect.

The app itself was elegant and cyberpunkish. The font was futuristic, the symbols precise and neomorphic. Exploring its features, I found two alarm libraries: one filled with soft, soothing sounds, and another with chaos-inducing tracks like *End of Days* and *Inferno*.

I set *Inferno* for the next minute. When it went off, the sound was overwhelming—a cacophony of guttural chants and screeching metal. My heart raced as I scrambled to solve the math problem on-screen. Finally, the noise stopped, leaving a deafening silence.

I stared at the door, expecting my mother to storm in and explain the demonic music. But no one came.

*Strange*, I thought. *Hadn’t she heard the noise?*

I shrugged. It didn’t seem possible she hadn’t heard it, but I wasn’t about to question it.

For all its drama, **Time** worked. It did what I needed.

I sighed and pressed the power button. The screen dimmed, the app’s logo weirdly lingering for just a second too long, like a faint afterimage burnt into the screen.

That night, I slept like a baby.

_________________________________________________


The next few days passed smoothly. Too smoothly, in fact.

By 6 a.m. every morning, the alarm dragged me out of bed, and by 10 p.m., I was fast asleep. The new sleep schedule had done wonders for my circadian rhythm. I was sleeping better, and feeling better. The app was doing exactly what it had promised. For some reason, my parents never complained about the noise. I doubted that they were even hearing it.

That Tuesday, I’d decided to visit a friend, Anu. She works in Pune now but had just returned to our hometown for a few days. We’d planned an evening of junk food and Netflix—the kind of easy companionship we hadn’t shared in months. It felt good to have something to look forward to.

Since my graduation, I had barely stepped out of the house. The thought of transitioning from a lazy room dweller since July to a full-time office worker in January loomed over me like a shadow. Little outings like this were a perfect way to shake off the inertia.

The sky was deepening into twilight as I pedalled down the quiet streets of my neighbourhood, the cool air soothing my mind. Anu’s house wasn’t far—a quick ride, maybe ten or twelve minutes. By the time I halted my bicycle in front of her house and rang the doorbell, the sky had already turned dark.

She answered the door with a sour expression.

“Couldn’t you have at least called or texted me?” Anu snapped, her tone bitter and sharp. “I’ve been waiting all evening!”

“What?” I asked incredulously, frowning.

“It’s 9:40, Tukai,” she said, resentment pouring through her voice. “You were supposed to be here by seven. I even ordered momos for us.”

“That’s not possible,” I protested firmly, shaking my head. “I just left home fifteen minutes ago. I swear!”

Anu huffed and crossed her arms tightly over her chest. “Check the time,” she said in a clipped voice, blinking rapidly as if to hold back her annoyance.

I pulled out my phone from my pocket and switched it on. The screen lit up, the numbers stark and jarring:

**9:46 P.M.**

My mouth went dry as the numbers flashed across the screen.

*How is this possible? I left my house not even 20 minutes ago. Sure, I hadn’t checked the time while leaving, but I’d left before sunset. Her house is barely a few minutes from mine. This cannot be possible. How did this happ-*

Anu’s voice cut across my frantic thoughts. “You should leave, Tukai. It’s getting late.”

I nodded stiffly, not daring to look her in the eyes. I mounted my bicycle again and rode home in silence, my chest tight and heavy. An odd, uneasy feeling coiled up my belly. How had I skipped 2-3 hours of my life? What had I been doing? Had I departed late from my house? But I distinctly remember the faint, orange rays of the setting sun when I had gotten out of my house.

When I entered the living room, my mum glanced and said casually, “You must’ve had fun. You were gone for a long time.”

*Gone a long time? But I just went out. You saw me leave!*

The words swirled in my head angrily, but I swallowed them down. “Yeah, we had fun,” I mumbled, forcing a quick smile before retreating to my room.

Inside, I sank onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. I closed my eyes, trying to forget what had just transpired.

_________________________________________________


The very next day, I was at the dining table, sipping coffee and chatting with a friend of mine, Rishi, over WhatsApp.

We were talking about the previous day’s weird experience. Rishi tried tooth and nail to rationalise and find some sort of logical explanation for what had happened, but he was failing miserably. After a while, we gave up, and the conversation drifted to local gossip and random memes.

As always, my mobile was in dark mode, which meant I had to angle the screen just right to avoid catching my reflection. I hated seeing my face staring back at me.

While Rishi and I texted about the current political scenario of our state, I caught something on the screen. Not my face—someone else’s.

My mother.

She was standing behind me, wearing a blue silk saree. The image was faint but unmistakable.

I felt goosebumps on my neck as I turned at lightning speed.

“Is there something you ne-

There was no one. Not a single being in sight.

The room was empty, silent but for the faint hum of the ceiling fan. I felt my pulse quicken up, and my eyes darted in every direction for my mother. There was no way she’d just teleported out of the place. But then again, I hadn’t actually heard her footsteps approach me. I had probably hallucinated.

*It is just a trick of the light against the dark screen.*

I told myself, and returned to my mobile phone and started texting Rishi again. And then the creepiest thing happened.

I heard footsteps coming down from the staircase.

My mum, this time in reality, came down to the living room wearing the exact blue saree that I just *imagined* seeing her in. I stared with my mouth open as she walked up to me and stood just behind my chair like earlier—as if a record was playing.

“I’m heading to the bazaar. Do you need anything?” She asked sincerely.

I just shook my head, not trusting my voice.

She waved at me and left. My hands were trembling too much for me to wave back.

_________________________________________________


As the days progressed, things started to get weirder. *Eerier*. Reality began to slip through my fingers, and I felt time had become untethered from me—or I from it.

I started noticing strange lapses. I’d turn on the laptop to stream a movie, settling in with a blanket and a cup of tea, only to blink and see that the credits were rolling—the film had ended. The blanket and couch would feel warm, as though I’d sat there for hours, though I knew I had just entered the room. Weirdly, I’d even remember the plot of the film, just not the experience of watching it.

Then the lapses began to stretch. I’d sit idly, watching the late afternoon sunlight pour through the windows, golden and warm. But the light would shift too quickly, the shadows stretching and contorting unnaturally fast. I’d spring to my feet in alarm, my heart pounding, and realise that hours had passed. The day had already ended; the room swallowed by evening.

It became harder and harder to anchor myself. Time was slipping through my fingers like vapour and smoke, impossible to grasp. Even when I stared at a clock, its hands steady and precise, the hours seemed to dissolve between one heartbeat and the next. A faint *ticking* sound always rang in the back of my mind. Quiet but persistent.

Once, at the railway station, I was trying to reach platform 2. The stairwell stretched before me, long and crowded, and I heard the train’s arrival announced loudly over the intercom. I started climbing up the stairs, the smell of iron and grease thick in the air. But when I reached the final stair, I felt the oddest sensation, like a ripple beneath my feet.

I was back at the beginning. My foot—the one I’d raised just a second ago—was placed on the bottommost stair.

I froze and stared up, bewildered. It was impossible—I’d just climbed it. My legs ached from the effort. Yet there I was, stepping onto the bottommost stair as if the ascent had never happened.

Panic gripped me as I tried again, only to find myself at the base once more, trapped in an endless loop of steps, like a hamster on a wheel. The arrival of the train was announced again. And again. And again.

I fled the station in sheer horror.

*After I get my first paycheque, I’ll go see a therapist.*

I comforted myself. But the truth was harder to admit: I couldn’t trust myself anymore. Not my senses, not my memory, and certainly not time.

_________________________________________________

Yesterday, my life turned upside down.

I’d been doomscrolling YouTube shorts, rotting away in bed as there I didn’t need to keep track of time. The only moment I looked forward to was 10 p.m., when I’d drift into sleep, knowing **Time** would wake me precisely at 6 a.m. It was the only anchor in my disjointed days—a fragile sense of control when everything else seemed to be falling apart.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a WhatsApp notification from my friend, Rai.

I tapped the message, and her chat opened:

>Rai: Hey Tukai, tysm! The app is so cuteeeee.

I blinked. *Cute? That’s not a word I’d use to describe* **Time**. Its geeky design was clean, functional, and precise—certainly not cute.

Curious, I typed back:

>Me: Send me a screenshot pls?

Her response came instantly. The screenshot she sent made my stomach drop.

The interface was **completely different**. Her version was pastel pink. Bubbly fonts and cartoonish icons scattered across the screen. It looked like a glorified planner for a middle school kid. Almost as if the app was tailored to Rai’s preferences. Just like mine felt like a perfect match for me.

I frowned. Surely, there was an explanation. A new update, maybe? I opened **Time** to check for customisations or skin features. Nothing. I combed through the app’s settings, its menus, and the sidebar—still nothing.

Feeling unsettled, I went back to the Reddit thread where I’d found the app’s link. The comment—the one with the offer to download the app for free—was gone. Completely erased.

Unease prickled at the back of my neck. Something was wrong.

I opened my smartphone’s settings and navigated to the app manager. Time had to go. But when I uninstalled it, the app’s icon vanished for only a moment before reappearing on my home screen.

I tried again. And again. Each time, Time rebooted itself, as if mocking me.

The faint ticking sound I’d been hearing for weeks—so faint I’d brushed it off as my imagination—grew louder, a rhythmic **tick-tick-tick** building in intensity. It wasn’t coming from the phone. It was all around me, reverberating through the walls.

Then I felt it.

A presence behind me.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat. Slowly, I raised my eyes to the mirror on the wall in front of me. Through the reflection, I saw the window behind me—and standing just beyond the glass was **Me**.

Or something that looked like me.

Its face was distorted. Blurred, dark, with features stretched into an unnatural, predatory grin. The reflection didn’t just smile—it stared at me, unblinking, as though waiting for permission to step inside.

I bolted upright. I spun around to face the window. It was empty—just the pale glow of the streetlights outside. My heart was beating in my throat.

Suddenly my mobile burnt searingly hot. I dropped it. It fell onto the bed. The screen went dark on its own. And then it lit up again.

A figure appeared on the display. Pixellated, humanoid, and constantly shifting.

A message appeared in stark, white text:

>Good evening. We need to talk.

My heart raced. My voice failed me. Another message popped up.

>You’ve enjoyed our app. Now it’s time to repay your debt.

“What debt?” I finally choked out.

The entity replied:

>The app was designed to extract time from those who waste it. Your time is transferred to those who truly deserve it. Mediocre hours fuel the extraordinary.

My stomach twisted. “Who’s taking it?”

The text blinked onto the display:

>A visionary, funding this app to extend his own life. And another… a paranormal ally who ensures compliance.

A wave of nausea hit me. “You’re stealing my life because I’m mediocre?”

The pixellated figure’s reply was cold, clinical:

>Yes.

I tried to argue, but the entity’s next message cut through my thoughts:

>You have two choices. Live a life where chunks of your time will be siphoned away, or share the app with 100 others. Choose now.

“No,” I whispered. “I’m not doing either.”

The screen flickered, and another message appeared:

>That is not an option.

Suddenly, the phone started buzzing, and the screen flickered rapidly. On one side of the phone screen, a stopwatch appeared, glowing red.

On the other side, a timer zoomed into existence, resting idle at **00:30**.

The stopwatch started running. I got stuck. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond. My legs, arms—everything was frozen in place. The stopwatch kept ticking relentlessly.

More text appeared on the display:

>The stopwatch freezes you. The timer counts down your decision. If you choose neither, you will disappear, and the mimic outside your window will take your place. Your entire lifetime will be split—half to the oligarch, half to the entity within this app. Your 30 seconds start now.

The timer started counting down.

**00:29**

**00:28**

**00:27**

From the corner of my eye, I saw it: the **mimic**. The dark outline of its hand pressed against the glass pane, as if waiting eagerly to enter.

**00:21**

**00:20**

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. My limbs were becoming translucent, dissolving like mist. The mimic edged closer, its eyes glittering with malice.

The timer ticked down.

**00:13**

**00:12**

Desperate, I focussed all my thoughts on the second option: Option B. *Option B!*

The moment I chose, the timer stopped at **00:09 seconds**.

The screen went black. The stopwatch and timer lingered, like a faint glow on either edge of the display, and then promptly vanished. The mimic was nowhere to be seen. I could feel my limbs moving again. They were not translucent anymore.

After a while, my mobile turned on by itself—the **Time** app opened, glaring at me.

For a moment, the room was silent.

Then my phone buzzed, and a notification popped up on the top of the screen:

>You have 48 hours.

_________________________________________________

So now I’m asking you again. Please follow the link that I’m sharing in the comments. You don’t need to download **Time**. I remember the text. It clearly stated that I needed to *share* the app with 100 others. Their downloading the app was not a condition. Just log in to the FTP server. Don’t download the APK files.

The faint ticking sound is growing louder again. And I think I see someone standing in the dark corner of my room.",3,1733494804.0,kolkata,3,1.0,False

And this one I know they’ve brought back the past few years so I didn’t feel the need to get more than one backup. The two new Bridgerton. The leather on Colin’s Return really comes thru I'm really excited to burn it and try it. The white floral one, Penelope’s First Kiss smells so pretty. I am a huge floral fan in the spring. I'm def gonna burn it and make sure I like it and then prob set it aside for the spring. And the Emily in Paris Paris Amour. Smells pretty. Am I obsessed? No but LOOK AT THE JAR. 
I budgeted and aimed for 6 to fill a whole carton. I ended up with 7 but I had a 10$ of a 40$ purchase coupon so I only paid for 6 as intended. Only one that I was contemplating that I didn’t get was Palo Santo. Hopefully it makes another appearance later in the year. If not I’m sure I’ll find another summer woody scent I like.

Note that these are all based on a hedonic rating scale based purely on enjoyment, not any BJCP style-based approach which I find boring. Also it was a light year for me, 66 total new beers tried, lifetime total 3537.

1. Maine Beer Lunch 4.3/5 (IPA)

Another classic, this one definitely closer to the East Coast mold as promised in the commercial description. Light haze, golden leaning to amber. Nose is balanced between a deep bready and caramel malt and a floral and citric hop. Nice rounded mouthfeel, sweet bread, light lemon peel hop flavors, a very faint stonefruit element is hiding in there - otherwise clean, balanced, great malt fullness with a fun bitter and floral/citric hop profile. I see why this has the reputation it does. Bottled Aug 27th and drank in Florida on 9/7/24, that's ridiculously fresh.

2. Main Beer Woods & Waters 4.2/5 (IPA)

Oh wow this is like a blast from the past. Pale golden, dry as heck, crisp, crackery malts, bitter resin and citrus rind hop profile, its a classic IPA. Medium bitterness. I don't have a lot to say because its so simple and straightforward, but its just so damn refreshing to find an IPA like this instead of all the creamy/juicy/hazy weird shit out there. Bottled August 20th 2024 and found in Central Florida on 9/7/24, that's a fresh bottle to make it this far!

3. Cerebral Cryptic Message 4.1/5 (schwarzbier)

Man these guys are good, 2nd Cerebral beer tonight, and I love a good schwarzbier and this is a good schwarzbier. Nicely profiled with a gentle coffee note. Semi-sweet overall. Bitter chocolate, light coffee, bready, light caramel or toffee notes.

  
4. Barrier/Other Half Half & Half 4.1/5 (Coffee flavored imperial stout)

Can. Outstanding - and this coming from a guy who long ago has been burned out on the imperial stouts. Pours reasonably dark, thick beige head holds on. Nose is rich coffee, bitter chocolate, and roasted malt, and excellent blended together in a nice balance. It all comes together even more so in the flavor, with a light creamy sweetness and full carbonation to hold it up. Its not even too sweet or heavy, its really semi-sweet, balanced with dark chocolate, coffee bitterness, and more roast. Medium to almost heavy bodied. Lingering chocolate flavors lean almost acrid but not quite.

5. Lambiek Fabriek Oude Geuze Brett-Elle 4.1/5 (gueuze)

Nice! Doughy and floral nose. Fairly strong sourness, real punchy and tight up front. Green apple notes, maybe tart lemon rind, a little apple cider vinegar. Some indistinct fruit on the nose too. Peach juice? Light to medium body, fizzy, real nice to drink.

6. Arkane Skinny Clouds 4.1/5  (Hazy IPA)

So I always wanna complain about this style, the hazy, overtaking the IPA category with its weird creaminess and low bitterness. But every now and then i get one that I just can't be mad at. Here's one. Super hazy appearance, very pale yellow-white, gigantic overflowing head. Nose is big fresh hop, with a ton of citrus esp grapefruit, some tropical fruit, some resin. Flavor much the same, the grapefruit rind zing hits, and then fades, with a mild lightly bready malt presence. Closer the bottom of the glass the yeastiness starts to show, esp in the nose with a distinct doughy note. There's a fair bit of yeast sediment in the glass.

7. The Veil Arctic Crypt 4.1/5 (Imperial stout)

Yeepers this is the darkest beer I've ever seen. You'd think past a certain point beer couldn't get much dark but then there's this. None more black. Even the head is nearly black! Big heavy malt nose, full of dark things, nutty, dark chocolate, molasses, leather and a touch of bourbon. Flavor is super rich, nearly acrid black malt quickly balanced by a big sweet heavy chocolate, light coffee and vanilla. Super velvety mouthfeel. This is a big strong heavy beer too though the booze manages to be balanced out by all that other stuff. You feel the warmth in the chest though, and you feel the alcohol soon enough.

8. Une Annee (Hubbard’s Cave) Quad 4.0/5 (abbey style quadrupel)

Hot damn guys what are we doing here and where did this come from? Never heard of them so this is my first beer from the brewery and they've really put together a real quad! Brownish, hazy, small head. Nose gives lots of darker fruits, fig. Brown sugar. Very faint phenol. Flavor similar, with a big bruised fruit sweetness, mild efferverscence carries to a lightly spicy (and also tannic?) and lightly boozy finish. Plenty of dark fruit notes abound, sugar and spice and everything nice. It's maybe somewhat less complex than I'm letting on (certainly less complex than Westy 12) but they've really hit the mark here.

9. MYTHK Death & Renewal 4.0/5 (weizenbock)

Pours a cloudy brownish color, huge foaming khaki head spills over but then fades quite quickly. Nose is heavy on sweet and candied malt, a touch doughy. Flavor similar, more dough and yeast, sweet to semi-sweet, caramel and molasses, a light hint of a dark fruit, hard to specify, maybe a sweet bruised apple or pear, or maybe their commercial description of orchard fruit is leading me on. Leans also into fig or date territory but not quite the way certain belgian styles do. Very light phenols round out the finish, just a hint of clove. Heavy overall palate, but not cloying or harsh. So refreshing to find a beer that isn't a heavily fruited sour or hazy IPA.

10. Allagash Haunted House 4.0/5 (Belgian dark ale)

To me this is one of my favorite beer styles, and this really drinks like a dark ESB with a little extra hop, and I love it. I recall 25 years ago, american craft brewers were all making beers like this, whether brown or red, and I loved it. So I'm ecstatic about this beer. Dull brown color, modest head. Nose is mildly hoppy, very bready, nutty. Flavor has a nice herbal, grassy hop, maybe a hint of citrus, and more of that nutty bready malt character. Super well balanced between the sweet malts and bittering hops to finish. Finishes balanced to semi-dry. I could drink these all night.

Alpine lakes wore each shade of boreal blues and greens while mountains of ice calved into mossy tundra. Locals climb these hills with pack horses to haul smaller bits of glacial debris home, mixing the ice with various fruits for a special treat called “shikashika.” Glaciers for dessert, imagine how sweet.
