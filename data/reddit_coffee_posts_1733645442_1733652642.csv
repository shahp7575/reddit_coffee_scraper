1h9frdz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h9frdz,Kitchentron Lore Dump Formatted like an in-universe Report:,"K.I.T.C.H.E.N.

Aka: Killer Indomitable Toaster Crusher Harnessing Electricity Neo.

Originally created to fight an army of evil toasters, KitchenTron is a formidable machine. Standing at a towering 109 ft, its size and power make it an overwhelming force. 

Build: The machine has four limbs, each utilizing a weapon similar in appearance to a kitchen appliance. On its back is a large apparatus similar in appearance to a ventilation fan. This is used as a rocket thruster. The cockpit is located in the head, behind a large, transparent pane of glass-like material that behaves like tinted glass (lets minimal light in). It's a dark, rectangular room, with four bridges connecting the four sides of the rectangle to a central control panel. The handrails, lights, and other highlights are a dark yiga red, as opposed to the dark metal grays and blacks of the rest of the cockpit. The central control panel is located on a circular platform connected to the four bridges, and contains a vast array of levers and buttons. There is also a chair. Both of these can lower into the floor for MALEVOLENT form. Four lightning rods are placed at the corners of the room. As Meta stirs up a thunderstorm, lightning strikes these areas, providing KITCHEN with ample electricity. For emergencies and autopilot, there is an extra battery, a powerful resivoir of ancient Sheikah fuel.

Protocols:

Bottle Rockets: A large quantity of rockets are shot from the fridge torso, with its doors open. They home into their target, and federation storm missile technology has been applied as well. A single missile is 7 ft long, and is branded with a logo painted onto it. The logo is styled to appear like the plastic band around bottled beverages, except with the branding of ""Kohga Cola"" and other YigaCola products on it. This is a devastating attack that attempts to overwhelm the enemy with an unreasonable amount of firepower.

Freeze: Opening the doors of the fridge, which has cryonis technology, a massive gust of cold wind is sent out. The powerful blizzard is capable of instantly freezing smaller foes. 

Burn: Shoots a simple jet of blue Sheikah flame from its stovetop arm. It's very large, long, and cylindrical. It basically equates to an extremely large flame emitter.

Stove Rocket: The stovetop arm telescopically extends into a cannon of sorts, allowing for usage of **Burn Cannon**. Automatically activated in MALEVOLENT form.

Burn Cannon: Fires a blue fireball similar in size and shape to a flame gleeok's. It moves rather fast as well, although its speed is increased in MALEVOLENT form.

Waffle cannon: Heats a large amount of waffle batter in the waffle hand, then fires them as deadly discs at the enemy. Uses blunt force, as well as its sheer weight to concuss and smother opponents. The waffles taste delicious. It's a tactical waste of food.

Waffle Trap: By clamping onto a smaller enemy with the waffle maker hand and activating it, a waffle is cooked around the target. From there, they can be ejected with **Waffle Cannon**. This attack also seriously burns the enemy.

Kettle Hammer: A slam using the kettle arm. Can be charged by spinning it. (Like Thor does with his hammer.)

Scald Stream: Pours out a stream of boiling hot water from the kettle as an offensive.

Cryo Catapult: This move is initiated by spinning the kettle horizontally. It first allows water to spill from the kettle's opening, then uses cryonis tech to freeze it into a neat cube, and lastly bats it forward with the bottom of the kettle. This is repeated for a consistent and constant stream of ice block projectiles.

Flush Out: Sends the boiling water from the kettle arm into the rest of KITCHEN'S infrastructure, flowing from the top arm to its feet. Used to flush out small creatures attempting to infiltrate its systems.

Mix Drill: Uses the cake mixer hand to drill at foes, and drill into the ground. KITCHEN's closest thing to a spear. 

Mix Missile: Fires up to two metal ends of the cake mixer arm at foes. Each one acts like a drill projectile. 

Coffee Spill: spills a large amount of dark liquid from the coffee leg to slip opponents. Has the choice between actual, synthesized coffee, or flammable crude oil.

Blend Kick: After reeling back and spinning the blender leg quickly, KITCHEN unleashed a devastating kick with the blender leg. This kick has lots of spin. This protocol also has the option of KITCHEN supporting itself on the blender leg while spinning, causing it to pirouette in circles like a deadly tornado.

Blend Stomp: The blades in the blender extend under the blender foot. They can be used to entangle and cut tentacles as well as unleash a powerful stomp that mangles foes.

Blender Model: Uses Potassis/Autobuild technology to create something in its chamber. Consumes Bananas from a bananamancy staff hidden within the machine.

Code Blend: Hacks enemy systems using the blender... Somehow. Unusually effective when tried. A residual ability from the Toaster Armada.

Regenerative Rice: A passive ability that constantly heals KITCHEN using the rice cooker pelvis. A residual ability from the Toaster Armada.

Blast Off: Uses the Ventilation-Fan-Rocket-Thruster to fly. Air speed is fast, but slow compared to other flying machines such as spaceships and such. Emits grey smoke and orange flames. (Note: these are the actual ventilation fans of KitchenTron as well.)

Divine Beam: A full-power, concentrated laser, identical in power to a divine beast's is shot from the eye. Needs time to charge.

Divine Grace: A weaker version of **Divine Beam**, not having reached full charge. It's effects are similar to the residual energy rain that hit Calamity Ganon in Botw after being filtered through the Castle's sanctum.

M.A.L.E.V.O.L.E.N.T. K.I.T.C.H.E.N

Aka: Maximum Annihilator Legend EVOLution Exoadaptive Nemesis Transformed.

This new form was made as an update to K.I.T.C.H.E.N. . Malevolent Kitchentron has a much higher mobility and durability compared to its original form. Imagine a mobile suit Gundam or transformers 1 Optimus Prime as opposed to the Hulk Buster or the divine beasts. This form consumes a copious amount of energy, eating into the backup battery even with Meta's main power. This form can only last so long, but it's benefits make it worth transforming into. It's 126 ft tall. The control panel and chair in the cockpit lowers down. The machine is now controlled by Meta's own movements, detected by four spherical drones that are released from compartments in the ceiling and walls, hover to the control platform, and clamp onto Meta's limbs. They hover in the air and simulate the battle as best as they can for Meta.

Protocols:

All of KitchenTron's protocols.

Freezer Fractal: Unleashes hundreds of ice lasers, similar to a frost gleeok's, from the fridge torso. These lasers move erratically, trying to catch dodging foes. They appear like a laser light show.

Burn Column: An enhanced version of burn. A focused jet of blue fire rivalling the heat of a sun.

Burn Blast: A massive area of effect blast of flame from the stovetop arm. Covers an extremely large area of effect, effectively burning everything in the general direction of the stovetop arm's aim.

Burn Cannon+: Fires a larger amount of blue fireballs, faster as well. 

Kettle Hammer+: Some of the fluid inside the kettle is replaced by ancient Sheikah fuel, imbuing every strike with the power of a guardian weapon/guardian laser/ancient arrow.

Triple Cryo Catapult: Using the three openings on the kettle, three ice blocks can now be shot out. (It's water, not fuel, the kettle has two compartments.)

Quad Mix Missile: Fires up to four metal ends of the upgraded cake mixer arm at foes. Each one acts like a drill projectile. 

Triple Vents/Rockets: Uses protocol blast off, but with an added two rockets. Has much more air speed and maneuverability. Emits blue flames and mystical blue smoke. Leaves a neon blue streak in the sky when flying fast.

Leg Thrusters: There's rocket thrusters below the feet now for extra maneuverability. Self-explanatory.

Divine Blade: Uses Sheikah runes similar to guardian weapons to shape the flames of the stovetop arm into the shape of a massive weapon. Can vary between a guardian sword, guardian axe, and ancient shortsword. Allows the machine to use basic slash attacks.

Divine Column: Combines **Divine Beam**, **Burn Blast**, and **Freezer Fractal** to create one single special attack. Consists of a large, powerful laser imbued with flames that fly and twist around it, as well as smaller ice beams to catch dodging opponents. Consumes so much energy that continuing to use any more moves in MALEVOLENT form will cause KITCHEN to power down entirely. It's advises to power down to base form after using this move.

Dimensional Cut: A special slash attack from the **divine blade**. This attack cleaves through dimensions, ignoring its targets durability. It is surprisingly fast, and it also has a large range due to the blade's length. Using most of the machine's power, it will cause the machine to either forcefully power down to base form, or power down completely depending on its duration spent in MALEVOLENT form previously. 

Addendum: H.O.U.S.E. also existed. (Image 5) It was house-sized relative to KITCHEN being fridge sized. After using it to fight Observr, it was dismantled, and I will not go into its protocols due to that.",1,1733652333.0,ChaoticYigaClan,1,1.0,False

By midday, the clouds should start to part, revealing some sunny intervals. This is the perfect time to hit the beach or enjoy some outdoor activities. Just remember to stay hydrated and lather on that sunscreen to avoid any unexpected sunburns. 

As evening approaches, the temperature will drop a bit, creating a pleasant and breezy atmosphere.

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

I‚Äôm 9 months pregnant. My mom recently had a gathering in connection to her birthday where a few family members showed up. This included 2 aunts, my aunt‚Äôs husband, my sister and her bf, niece, my grandmother and me, my son and husband. I had already arrived at my moms‚Äô early in the morning to let my son play with his cousin and to just hang out. I had also contributed an apple pie and cookies for the event and wanted to help set up.

After I showed up my mom told me my sis and her bf would also be attending, and I messaged this to my husband who was sleeping in (as he had the day off). My husband asked if he could skip the party but I convinced him we would only stay for 30 min to meet some people and then go home as I was already starting to feel tired and achy due to my pregnancy. (I've got ligament pains and Braxton hicks.) My husband agreed despite how cramped, and honestly a bit claustrophobic, the event would likely be. For context, my mom lives in a fairly small apartment. 

Fast forward to the afternoon and people start to show up and I attempt to be as conversational and outgoing as I can, but being autistic this takes a lot of energy and I was drained within 15 minutes. My husband held his own and my son got ice-cream so he was having a great time. By the 30 to 40 minute mark I told my mom it was time for us to leave, and she had no issues as I had already told her beforehand and she totally understood. Ushering me to go home and rest. My son was staying the night so he kept playing, and my husband lingered on the sofa across the apartment as I was putting on my shoes by the front door.

Here is where things took a turn.

My grandmother (82 f) saw me as she walked past to the kitchen and asked me ‚ÄúAre you leaving now? Already?‚Äù And I replied that yes, we are. She was firmly against this and said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYour poor husband hasn't even had time to sit down.‚Äù Putting on quite the show about how sad and awful it was that my husband wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to stay longer. I waved these comments off. My aunt was hanging around and my grandmother pointed to my aunt‚Äôs boots and said ‚ÄúDid you see her boots?‚Äù And I did, since I gave them to her, explaining ‚ÄúYes I did, they didn‚Äôt fit me.‚Äù My grandmother wondered if I had such big feet that I couldn't fit the boots and I shrugged, explaining my shoe size (I'm tall = bigger feet) and that sometimes shoes just fit wrong. This random turn in conversation to point out a bodily flaw of mine put me on edge even though my aunt backed me up by agreeing to my statement. 

I began buttoning my coat at this point, getting frustrated when my grandmother went back to shaming me for leaving so early and I replied that I'm heavily pregnant and tired. And though my tone probably wasn't very nice my aunt nodded along, agreeing that I had to be tired. Now my husband came into the kitchen to put his plate in the sink and my grandmother instantly latched onto him, saying ‚ÄúYou poor thing, you weren‚Äôt even able to finish your coffee.‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúWell he can stay then, but I‚Äôm going.‚Äù My husband attempted to just smile his way out of the discomfort and excused himself to get dressed, whilst I said bye to the other guests. My mom and son came to see us off. 

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that no one else seemed to have any issue with us leaving. 

As we left I started crying in the parking lot for a good 30 minutes. I felt so sad that my grandmother turned so hostile during this pregnancy as I have tried to build a relationship with her for the last year by visiting with my son and sending her more messages with updates etc. I have actually avoided her for a while now because she made some comments after I found out I‚Äôm having another boy, which apparently was ""too bad"" and it was ""so sad‚Äù that we didn‚Äôt get a daughter this time around. My grandmother was mean to me growing up, always having a short temper with me and excluding me so I was happy we had turned a new leaf over the years. She has gushed about me to my mom and helped my little family financially when we struggled, so this change in behaviour really upsets me now.

AITAH if I decide to limit contact with my grandma (or cut it all together) for the rest of my pregnancy and maybe even some time postpartum? Or should I have more understanding as she is old and this is just how old people behave sometimes? 

I've got different feedback from my husband and mom so I need some outsider perspectives to know if I'm just too emotional or if my grandma's behaviour truly was mean-spirited.

She was still married and in sales just like me. Her territory was about two hours away. Long story short she started telling me her husband was abusive . And then slowly started making passes at me. I shut them down every time due to being cheated on in my own marriage and my respected tenure and role as a mentor to younger sales reps. Eventually she announces her official separation and I did take her on a date. Eventually we start seriously saying. Sleeping together . Meet each others kids etc. I full on fell in love. I pulled strings and got her a better sales territory in the same region as me so we could move in together . About this time we find out she‚Äôs pregnant. We both are beyond thrilled as we both love our current kids and are in a good position to grow a family. I start planning to propose. About this time, knowing we will be at OB appointments together, she says that ‚Äúfor is calling her to share her darkest parts‚Äù this follows a convo we had when we first started dating where I opened up about my very very dark past that affects me still and that I wanted her as my partner to know to understand me better. I also was adamant that no matter what, I would love her and accept her past and baggage , it‚Äôs what makes us who we are now and that is my mentality. Anyways, she told me after 6 months of us having unprotected sex and her now being pregnant  that she actually has had herpes the entire time. After several tests I could firmes I did not get it. And I forgave her. But that was the tip of the iceberg. We ran into a man acquaintance of mine that I dont respect for his open use of cocaine and hookers but he has old family money and I unfortunately have to deal with him in business. We see him on our date and she looks mortified. She had asked me if I knew him when we first met. I saw her reaction and when he left I asked what the deal was. She swore nothing so I brushed it off. But something wasn‚Äôt right. A week later I get a wedding invite and that same guy will be there . This wedding is a childhood best friend and the same wasn‚Äôt rich circle will be there. I tell her he will be there and if he sees her there if anything happened the. My friends will tell me because he will chirp and brag. She swears nothing happened and we moved on . Two days later it behinds. She finally tells me they went on a date. But then a couple days later I ask again and say ‚Äúseriously why lie about it before what happened‚Äù and she tells me they fucked once. And then she freaked out thinking I would ask the guy (I never would) and she tells me he is one of the first guys that she fucked as a prostitute on seeking arrangements . She also admitted he didn‚Äôt actually pay her because she forgot to negotiate up front . Now I literally said thank you and was genuinely happy and supportive because she told the truth . She told me he was one of three . But something was off. So I basically asked her periodically and did my own digging and eventually after no joke six times if her telling me that it was just three guys she was a prostitute for. Her lying to my face repeatedly as I reassure her that I really don‚Äôt care I just need to know because we are in my home town and I know these people . She admits through lie after lie that it was more like 20+ guys for $200-$400 a piece . That her old middle school principal was one. That most were married . That she cheated on her ex husband with some of them .oh which that reminds me . She ‚Äújust made out‚Äù and ‚Äúonly sent one random nude‚Äù to her ex while we were dating . So she cheated on me with her ex and her ex for money before me. And guess what, when I asked why she did it because she had a very good big girl job while being a hooker, she said she wanted a puppy and nicer things and saw it as just a job. She said she didn‚Äôt care that they had wives and kids. The only thing that really bothered me was how convincingly she lied to me about it over and over. With conviction. Crying a praying god take her daughter and kill her if she was lying . And then turns out she was lying. She also only ever told the truth when I told her I would find out through the wedding and then finally all of it when I said I would pull phone records . But wait! There‚Äôs more! So I actually try to forgive her. And then I‚Äôm looking at rings to propose. And her best friend who is helping me (doesn‚Äôt know my gf was a hooker ) calls me one night and says ‚ÄúI know you love her and want to propose . But I need you to know you need to be careful you‚Äôre a great guy and she hasn‚Äôt been who you think. Not wanting to show my hand I tell her idk what she‚Äôs talking about. She says nothing about the prostitution but instead tells me that my gf who works for the same company as me was fucking customers behind my back in her last territory . One customer says he swears to god he has no reason to lie but that he bent her over and fucked get on his boat for minimal sales product. Simultaneously . She‚Äôs now in her new territory and two other sales reps approach me saying that their customers are fucking her or used to. Mind you, she is pregnant with what I was excited to think was my child. I paid for her house , and everything else and hell I got her this territory she‚Äôs in. So this becomes too much for me and I move out and ask for a paternity test. All of these customers are married so I never could get concrete evidence . She refused paternity test . And within a week of me moving out she starts spinning it. Berating me that I am a bad man for abandoning her while pregnant . The whole thing affected my mental health to a point where her and I‚Äôs boss approaches me asking if I‚Äôm ok several times and I keep it to myself . Eventually they asked me to resign when my numbers were still the best in the division . So I left . I was crushed . I was a very respected member of the company and thought I would retire there. I later find out that the day after I got fired , her and my now ex boss went to coffee where he told her that I took customers to strip clubs while with her (I did that once for my largest customer and she knew about it) . He took info from my old company phone and told her it seemed sketchy . Without going into too much detail, he tried to drive a further wedge between her and I . Which he had no idea about anything aside from what I later found out . As soon as I moved out she got in his ear and played the victim. She beat me up mentally every day for months until I legit now feel bad for not being there for her( I know it‚Äôs dumb when I go no contact and rationalize) people are still coming out either way allegations about her fucking customers etc. I did tell her about one rumor but didn‚Äôt give her a name of who she was rumored to have slept with. I just gave details specific enough that it would be obvious to someone who actually did it. She immediately hung up on me and called that specific guy. She recorded their convo starting half ways through the conversation starting with a recording beep 10 min in and her saying ‚Äúok so I know you already told me you hadn‚Äôt heard anything but just to confirm you haven‚Äôt heard about me sleeping with anyone in your company right?‚Äù To which he said ‚Äúoh god no I mean you mostly deal with me and I‚Äôm married with daughters . ‚Äú she constantly just gaslights me and turns around and points the finger at me. She told me we were done and blocked me. So I went and saw a woman in another state and didn‚Äôt even sleep with her (this is a burner account  she would never see so I would tell you) . But she has now spun it to her family that I cheated on her while pregnant and abandoned her and that I‚Äôm a deadbeat piece of shit . I mean honestly this is such a tip of the iceberg type up because it‚Äôs wild the full extent of her lies and manipulation. She cheated on me . Lied to me. Almost gave me an incurable std. Got me fired . Made me borderline suicidal with her mental manipulation making me feel like I was wrong for distancing to get clarity . She literally ruined my life. She may be having my baby. I can‚Äôt prove it would possibly be anyone else‚Äôs but there is so much smoke that there has to be a fire somewhere . 7 separate rumors from difference sources of people saying she was fucking people behind my back . But what if somehow it isn‚Äôt true and she isn‚Äôt the hooker of her younger years? What if I let rumors keep me away from my soon to be son . I know that dumb and rationally she‚Äôs a narcissistic psychopath . She believes her own lies and truly does treat me and seemingly see me as a horrible man . Am I the asshole ?

I'd love to connect with a friend or two locally or internationally for some good times and some fun day to day chat. Anything goes from ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else. 

I'm a working professional. Outside of work, I volunteer, exercise, visit local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, and read. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too üëª

TDLR: both my parents while not actively abusive damaged my mental health and I find it difficult to relate to my brother so I don't like being around them

I find it really difficult to spend time with my family.
I (24m) never had a depraved childhood, but it wasn't as fun as it could be. My parents divorced when I was 16 and it placed a lot of strain on everyone - there am had been problems simmering since I was maybe 10 or 11, when I was 16 it fully came to a head and they officially separated. The deal was meant to be that we would sell the house I grew up in as it was too expensive to run and downsize, and that my mother would get the money from the house sale as my father had a salary in the high six figures working as a senior railway engineer in the Isle of Man whereas my mother had myself, my (now 28m) brother and cat to take care of. However due to a legal stipulation none of the money would be released until every detail was signed off, and my father deliberately dragged his feet over signing off on anything. What it meant was that we couldn't find anywhere to live, because while we had enough to pay something like a weekly short term accommodation charge we didn't have enough for a deposit. So for just under a year my family were bouncing from place to place to place from one week to the next. My father was fully aware of this because he'd be sent a text each day by my brother detailing the uncertainty of the situation. At around this time I landed a residential position at a college meaning that I had a roof over my head but my mother, brother, and cat didn't. 
Because I was worried about them and couldn't do anything to help I developed anxiety, and as a result of that I suffered from chronic insomnia as a stress reaction. I would generally go 3-4 days without sleep, crash, go 3-4 days etc. In hindsight I should have gone to a doctor about my sleeplessness but I just want thinking clearly so instead I'd drink heavily to get to sleep. My father would send me ¬£400 per month in child support payments which mostly went on cheap whiskey in an attempt to sleep at night. I got into the pattern of drinking a large quantity in the evenings to knock myself out and then drink coffee mixed with red bull and happy a dozen sugars in the morning to function throughout the day. I was a drunk and that made me hate myself because I thought that having a drink problem at such a young age was a sign of weakness.
I'm not going to go into details about my drinking other than the fact that most evenings I spent drunk and I began to experience blackout periods, and I was scared that if I continued in this vein I'd go from being a drunk to an alcoholic and I'd lose control of my life.
I cut back from being a drunk to a heavy drinker. It was brutal, I experienced crippling migraines, d&v, and acid reflux because when you drink heavily the cerebrospinal fluid that protects your brain starts to rely on the nutrients in alcohol. Afterwards I got a job working in a dementia care home and cut back from a heavy drinker to an occasional drinker. 

Anyway my family eventually found somewhere more permanent to live up until the point when I was around 18 when we reported a maintenance issue to our landlady so she responded with a Section 21 Eviction Notice. It was illegal but the letting agents were fist in glove with her so when we tried to appeal we got nowhere. We went to the local council and said ""We will be homeless in X days, we need help"", however as I only recently learned they didn't follow the correct procedure, and instead fobbed us off by saying the most they could offer was advice on debt management which was about as much use as a chocolate kettle.
Fortunately, we were thrown a lifeline by my employer. Our company ran two care homes - a 15 bed and a 9 bed home handling mid level dementia and above the 9 bed home was a flat the previous owners of the business used to live in. My boss and my manager loved me because I was good at my job, I regularly worked 50-60 hours a week, and was the go to guy to unfuck something so my boss let us stay there for about 6 months until I found somewhere else. I will forever be grateful to her for that because otherwise we'd have been under a bridge.

The biggest problem however is my mother, she's dependant on anti depressants and has no internal regulator on her emotions so when something goes wrong you're not her son you're an emotional support dog. What that meant was I'd spend 12 hours looking after mentally unwell people then go upstairs to spend the next 12 hours walking on eggshells trying not to upset a mentally unwell person. One time I had a shit day at work and couldn't face going upstairs to see her so I went for a walk, found myself in a Co-op buying a 70Cl bottle of whiskey and carried on walking. During said walk I drank the whole thing and was crying and shouting at the empty night over the fact that I felt like I'd lost control of my life and I felt like a passenger in my own life. I ended up being taken to hospital after I collapsed and slammed my head on a lamppost on the way down. The Doctor that saw me in Torbay A&E said I'd had a breakdown but I declined a mental health referral for the same reason my mother still doesn't know I had said breakdown - because there'd be a great wailing over how bad of a mother she is and what she's done to me and I'd find myself comforting her over something she did to me. It may not be intentional but it is gaslighting and I will not be subjected to that.

It would be helpful if I could rely on my brother but much as we love each other he's not a very mature person, he tends to live in a personal bubble and he's someone for whom the outside world happens to other people. I love my brother but I find him frustrating so I tend not to rely on him. 

I'm no longer in that situation, I have a loving girlfriend and we're getting to the stage that we want to move in together; and I have my dream job of being a Royal Navy Medical Assistant so I get to help people every day and make a positive contribution to their lives. I love my job and I'm good at it. 

The only things I truly care about are my loved ones, being good at my job and being able to help people, and never going back to the bad old days of alcohol abuse.

Even though my mother still loves me I don't want her any closer than arms length and will give the bare minimum support to her. It protects my peace but I feel like a prick whenever I do what. It's hard to know how I should feel about this",1,1733651085.0,family,1,1.0,False

I truly loved him and he betrayed me.

Some backstory is necessary. When I first met my husband, it was girls‚Äô night. He was chatting to my best friend (F31, 36DD) and it was clear she wasn‚Äôt into him. She turned him down. That‚Äôs when he started claiming to be a male feminist and I fell in love with him right then and there. I gave him my number and we started dating. It was a breath of fresh air to be dating someone who understood my struggles. I forgave him countless times for his mistakes. I didn‚Äôt mind that he called my breasts ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù. He loved me. I even forgave him when he slept with my Asian ex best friend (F29, 34B) who he claimed had nicer breasts (mine are larger??). I stopped talking to her when she came out of the closet and told me she‚Äôs a vegan.

We were together for ten years and we just got married November 4th of this year. It was a beautiful wedding and I had a gorgeous white dress that showed off my massive breasts. I was sexy and I wasn‚Äôt afraid to show it. We even had a friend‚Äôs (F28, 36C) cat (F7 tortie) officiate it! There was cake and singing and dancing and we lost the cat.

So when he came up to me a few days ago and keep in mind this is after my ex husband praised Kamala (F60, don‚Äôt know) as the right choice for America (C248, 133806ZZZZ) to tell me that he had a lapse in judgement when he reached the polling station and ended up voting for Trump I couldn‚Äôt believe my ears. I know some of you might be wondering and we found my friend‚Äôs cat since then. But the man I loved was willing to vote for someone like Trump. I took our dogs (F2 husky, M1 husky/Belgian shepherd) and went to my widow mother‚Äôs (F57, 40E) house without another word.

Since then he blew up my phone and I had to block him to get him to stop. My twin sister‚Äôs (F30, 36D) got her boyfriend (M32) to collect my stuff from our house today. Clothes, my vinyls, my books, my bras that barely contain my massive soft breasts, my blankets and anything else I owned. He gave me a short letter from my husband.

‚ÄúDear Lily, my beautiful wife. You are the angel. I love you so very much and I‚Äôm sorry for voting for Trump. I read a post on Reddit about a man who suddenly became gay due to the altitude difference and I think that‚Äôs what happened to me. I checked the polling station location again and it‚Äôs high up. It wasn‚Äôt my fault after all. Will you take me back? If not can we at least meet at a coffee shop and talk about this? Kind regards, Dave.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt believe him but I don‚Äôt know much about the science of altitudes so I‚Äôm considering hearing him out. I talked with my mother, twin sister and my daughter (F20, 36DD) and they think he‚Äôs lying and desperate and that meeting him is a stupid idea but I don‚Äôt know.

1h9fcgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h9fcgq/the_other_daughter_chapter_1/,The Other Daughter - Chapter 1,"I am the affair baby. That‚Äôs right‚Äîthe living, breathing reminder of every scandalous headline and whispered judgment. My mother? The infamous homewrecker everyone loves to hate.

Because of the circumstances of my birth, my story will always be seen as inseparable with the story of my parents.

My mother's father abandoned her and divorced my grandmother for another woman, leaving a trail of resentment in his wake. My grandmother, shattered and bitter, drowned herself in alcohol and made my mother her personal punching bag‚Äîboth physically and emotionally. At this time of darkness, she crossed paths with my father, the CEO of a prominent corporation.

The story goes that my dad was looking for romantic fun elsewhere, and subconsciously, probably emotional value as well. After a bond created and moments of love and passion, my mom became the clingy thorn he couldn‚Äôt shake off.

Back then, my teenaged mom was young and beautiful‚Äîhard for any man to resist.

My dad thought he had it all figured out: spend some money to keep a mistress, no big deal.

But how can you use paper to wrap and hide fire? My mother got pregnant, it was then my father admitted his marital status and true colors, believing that she will stick with him regardless at this point- which he was right, just not the way he'd like.

My mother didn't want to return to her mother, nor did she want to blow out the only light in her life, but what she didn't know was, it is nothing but a fall without an end for her.

My father thought he had everything under his control, but little did he know, my mom had bigger ambitions, after all, she was educated on the whole one pair of couple type of romance and marriage is the ultimate goal.

When her attempts to be the ""only one"" failed, she resorted to dramatic tactics‚Äîcrying, throwing fits, and even threatening to kill herself‚Äîand brought me into this world.

I was born a month premature. Why? Because when my mom heard that my dad‚Äôs wife had given birth, she rushed to the hospital for a C-section. The moment the anesthesia wore off, she called my dad, demanding he come and acknowledge his crying newborn daughter.

My dad turned off his phone.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt hate him at all. Who wouldn‚Äôt regret getting involved with such a relentless woman? Anyone in his shoes would wish they could rewind time and put their pants back on.

Unfortunately for him, because of me, he couldn‚Äôt get rid of my mom. She warned him: if he dared to abandon us, she‚Äôd take me and jump from the balcony of his company building.

When it came to dramatic ultimatums, my mom was a woman of action, not just words. At least she created enough of a spectacle to get the desired effect.

My dad set us up in a small apartment and sent us some living expenses every month. My mom‚Äôs stubbornness and shameless persistence ensured we had a roof over our heads.

My earliest memory of my dad involves my mom calling him nonstop for a month, escalating to her attempting suicide using sleeping pills and cutting her wrists multiple times. Finally, he begrudgingly showed up at our apartment.

He tossed down a stack of cash with a look of irritation. ""Isn‚Äôt this all you want? Tell my secretary next time. Don‚Äôt call me again.‚Äù

My mom immediately launched into an old tirade, her voice sharp as a train whistle, ‚ÄúChristian, where is your conscience? Do you remember back when‚Ä¶‚Äù

My dad, long immune to her complaints, pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Bella‚Äôs birthday today. I have to go.‚Äù

Bella‚ÄîBella Baldwin‚Äîwas the daughter he had with his wife. She and I were born on the same day, in the same year. The perfect child in the perfect family, while I was just an unwelcome reminder of his mistakes.

My mother dragged me forward, holding me up like a trophy. ‚ÄúAnd what about her? She‚Äôs your daughter too! Or have you forgotten?‚Äù

His face darkened as he turned toward the door. But my mother wasn‚Äôt done. She clung to his leg, wailing about betrayal and abandonment, tears and snot staining his tailored pants. Her sobs echoed in the cramped apartment, a painful soundtrack to their endless battles.

No one paid attention to me, the prop in their endless drama.

I walked over to the coffee table, looked at the stack of money, and asked my dad, ‚ÄúAre you very rich?‚Äù

He hesitated before awkwardly nodding.

I picked up the money, struggling to lift it, and held it out to him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat much, so I don‚Äôt need this much money. Can you stay with me for a few minutes instead?‚Äù

I saw the surprise and shock in his eyes. After a brief pause, he stiffly sat down on the sofa.

I grabbed a tattered booklet, an ad giveaway from the supermarket with simple stories and cartoon characters. Climbing onto the sofa, I sat beside him and placed the book in his hands. Without a hint of flattery, I asked naturally, like any child craving their father‚Äôs attention, ‚ÄúCan you read me a story?‚Äù

And so he did. Awkwardly, mechanically, he read a short passage. I listened carefully, gradually leaning against his arm.

When he was about to leave, I stopped him. Taking a small, smudged birthday cake from the table, I solemnly handed it to him.

It took him a moment to realize. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs your birthday too?‚Äù

I nodded shyly.

For once, he looked a bit uncomfortable, rubbing his hands together. ‚ÄúI came in a rush and didn‚Äôt bring you anything.‚Äù

I beamed and raised the booklet in my hand. ‚ÄúI already got the best birthday present.‚Äù

The next day, I received a doll taller than me.

I was five-years-old that year.

Some children learn to walk or talk early. My gift was different. By then, I already knew how to read the room, watch people‚Äôs faces, and calculate every move.

It was a survival skill I‚Äôd need for the rest of my life.",1,1733650541.0,stories,0,1.0,False

The city buzzed around me, people rushing to work, horns blaring in traffic, but I was always looking over my shoulder. Every shadow seemed to stretch toward me, every whisper on the wind seemed to know my name.

I had nothing but the clothes I ran out with and a handful of cash I‚Äôd hidden in my room. It wasn‚Äôt much, but enough to rent a small, dingy apartment on the edge of town. The walls were thin, and the smell of mildew clung to the air. At night, I‚Äôd huddle under my blankets, clutching the dull knife I kept by my side for protection.

The nightmares started almost immediately.

In them, I was back in the Varner house. The flames were gone, replaced by the suffocating darkness of the basement. The altar loomed before me, the twisted symbols on the walls writhing like living things. Gloria and Harold were there, their eyes glassy, their smiles too wide, their voices chanting in a language I didn‚Äôt understand.

I‚Äôd wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. But the worst part wasn‚Äôt the dreams‚Äîit was the marks they left behind.

One morning, I found a thin, jagged scratch running down my arm. Another day, there was a bruise on my ankle, shaped like fingers. I told myself I must be thrashing in my sleep, hitting the edge of the bed or the nightstand. But deep down, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true.

Something was still with me.


---

One night, as I was coming home from my shift at a coffee shop, I found a package sitting outside my door. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, no return address. My name was scrawled across the top in familiar, spidery handwriting.

My hands shook as I carried it inside. I locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob, and sat at the kitchen table. For a long time, I just stared at the package, dread coiling in my stomach.

Finally, I opened it.

Inside was the red ribbon.

The same ribbon I‚Äôd found in the trunk, the one that had bound the letters about the blood debt. It was frayed and stained, but unmistakable. Beneath it was a small, leather-bound book.

I flipped through the pages, my breath catching in my throat. The book was a journal, filled with entries written in Gloria‚Äôs hand. The words revealed things I wish I could unlearn.

""The vessel resists. But the ritual will proceed as planned.""

""It has been decades since the last blood moon. This time, we cannot fail.""

""Her blood carries the key. Our survival depends on it.""

The final entry was dated the day of the fire.

""Tonight, she will fulfill her purpose. The flames will not cleanse her. Blood binds, and blood always returns.""

I slammed the book shut, my hands trembling. That‚Äôs when I noticed something else in the box: a photo.

It was an old black-and-white picture of a group of people standing outside a cabin. They were smiling, but their eyes were hollow, their faces unnerving in their stillness. And there, in the middle of the group, was me.

I stumbled back, my chair scraping against the floor. It couldn‚Äôt be me‚Äîit shouldn‚Äôt be me. The photo was decades old, the edges yellowed with time. But the girl in the picture was identical to me, down to the scar on my chin from when I fell off my bike as a kid.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.


---

The next morning, I decided to leave town. It didn‚Äôt matter where I went, as long as it was far away. I packed my things and headed for the bus station.

The streets were unusually quiet. No cars, no people, just an eerie stillness. It reminded me of the moments before a storm.

As I turned the corner, I saw them.

Gloria and Harold, standing across the street.

They looked the same as they had the night of the fire‚Äîunburned, unchanged. Harold smiled, raising a hand in a mock wave. Gloria tilted her head, her eyes locking onto mine.

I ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop until I reached the bus station, my chest heaving and legs burning. I bought a ticket for the next bus out, not caring where it was headed.

As the bus pulled out of the station, I pressed my forehead against the window, trying to catch my breath. That‚Äôs when I saw it again: the photo, tucked into the seat pocket in front of me.

The same photo of the cabin.

But this time, everyone in the picture was smiling directly at me.",1,1733650422.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I get that your past with your family and co-workers has been traumatic for you. But you also need to understand that you have a certain misplaced loud, diva attitude that tends to overstep your friends' space. Coupled with your abandonment issues resulting in clingy behavior, it becomes overwhelming.

I appreciate that you've been checking in on me, but it appears it's more out of neediness to have me listen to your long rants, than to actually make sure I'm doing ok.

Even when I treated you out to lunch, you overstepped the offer by asking me to buy more food and coffee for you just because you happened to see my purse's contents. That was off-putting. 

You already know I also have my own numerous health issues to deal with constantly. Yet somehow you seemed annoyed when I explained I was having a hard time and burning out which is why I couldn't talk as much as you wanted to. 

This friendship is getting lopsided. I can't be your crutch. And you must also look at your pattern of people falling away from you because of your neediness, the need to have all the spotlight on yourself and us, your audience.

I am grateful for our time, but now I need plenty of space. You already have the tools you need for your growth and recovery, and I'll continue to root for you, but from a distance. ",1,1733650037.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Hey there,
I‚Äôm a 26-year-old Mexican-American guy who recently landed in Racine after spending most of my life in Tijuana. Fluent in Spanish and English, I‚Äôm equal parts deep thinker, dark humor connoisseur, and someone who can find a laugh in almost any situation.

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling that disconnect that hits when old friendships fade and social media becomes just another reminder of who‚Äôs drifted away. I‚Äôm looking to shake that off and meet some new people IRL‚Äîespecially folks around my age who don‚Äôt take life too seriously and are down for genuine, no-pressure connections.

A little about me: I love road trips, cooking, dancing, and singing (badly but enthusiastically). I also enjoy exploring random topics about life, society, or whatever absurd rabbit hole comes up in conversation. I‚Äôve got an adventurous side too, whether it‚Äôs discovering hidden gems around town or checking out a cozy dive bar‚Äîthough I‚Äôm currently living that sober life.

I‚Äôm also into gaming (NBA2K, FIFA) and tech concepts, so if you want to geek out over creative ideas, I‚Äôm all in. Coffee, a casual walk, brainstorming something cool‚Äîwhatever works. Life‚Äôs too short not to take a shot at meeting new people and making solid connections.

So, if any of this resonates with you and you‚Äôre up for a hangout or just chatting to see if we click, hit me up. Let‚Äôs make it happen.

Oh boy are these probably the worse beans I‚Äôve ever purchased. Let aside the idiotic price I paid for these. 

For starters, Starbucks probably doesn‚Äôt know what anything under a dark roast looks like. The beans I got are oily, dark, and smell burnt on the hand. 

I brew using a V60. I put a grind setting of 15 on C3, used water at 88-90C, and a ratio of 14:225. 

The brew tastes bitter and brown. That‚Äôs it. Upon some cool down, a slightly acidic flavour emerges, but you‚Äôve to look for it. The bitterness is hammering through while you look for the faintest trace of any other flavour or note. 

So guys, please try and recommend to me what I can do with these beans. I have a v60, a Kaldipress, and a SI filter. 

I think these ought to be relegated to strictly milk coffees. 

I‚Äôve had these right after finishing a pack of the best beans I‚Äôve ever owned, Fraction9 Mango naturals. I‚Äôm devastated and so is my palette. Yuck

I'm a 24F, 5'9"" with an average weight of 43kg. In November 2024, I set a goal to consume at least 2,500 calories daily to gain weight, but I never realized how challenging it would be.

My Current Diet:

Breakfast: Overnight soaked oats (1 cup with milk and peanut butter or Greek yogurt) + 1 cup of coffee with creamer.
Before November, I rarely had breakfast except for coffee. Even now, finishing the bowl feels like a struggle.

Lunch: A rice bowl or a veg roll.

Evening Snacks: Muffins or similar snacks.

Dinner: Rice bowl, pasta, biryani, etc.


Despite my efforts, I'm barely reaching 1,600‚Äì1,800 calories daily. My job involves long hours and frequent travel, leaving me with little time to cook or join a gym.

Some background to me; I‚Äôve been skinny my whole life and have had medical checkups; all tests came back normal. Doctors have advised me to ""just eat more,"" but it‚Äôs a struggle because I feel full before finishing my meals.

My current weight and hence appearance is affecting my confidence significantly. Outfits do not fit properly and I feel like clients, bosses, and stakeholders don't take me seriously, also my dating life has been non-existent. While these might seem trivial, they‚Äôve been hitting heavily on my mental health.


I feel like I  need to gain at least 10kg to look and feel healthy. Any advice on the following would be great:

1. High-calorie, easy-to-eat foods or meal suggestions (considering my limited cooking skills and busy schedule).


2. Any tips to increase my appetite or make eating more manageable.


3. General tips to build confidence while I work on my goals.



Fellow redditors, I‚Äôd be grateful for any advice or support, please help!

Hey there,

I'm on the lookout for someone ordinary ‚Äì someone who can be my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and maybe a bit more, if everything works out. But I'm not in a hurry. I believe in taking things slow, like taking our time to build a connection and get to know each other.

So, what exactly am I seeking? Well, I crave deep conversations and witty banter. I want someone who isn't afraid to open up to each other's emotional insecurities, trauma, let's just try to be real with each other, also someone who can match my curiosity and sense of humor (the darker the better). 

When it comes to interests, I appreciate art of all kinds, I have a deep appreciation for psychedelic art and music. I'm a big arsenal football club fan, also I'm a huge mental health advocate, let's be kind to each other. I enjoy watching critically acclaimed TV shows. I'm fueled by coffee and driven by guilt. Currently on a fitness journey, Trying to be regular at the gym and eating healthy, I would love it If we could exchange healthy cooking recipes.

But enough about me ‚Äì I'm very much interested in learning about you. Your likes, icks, tics and everything else. Let's even share our playlists. I would be more than happy it if you could give skin care and hair care tips. 

So, if you're up for intellectually stimulating conversations, sharing funny anecdotes, a genuine connection that transcends the superficial and dives deep into the essence of our beings or simply enjoying the silence of a comfortable conversation, I'm here for it all. Shoot me a DM if you relate and seek something similar.

So, I am the only coffee drinker in my house (unless we have guests) and have a double shot most days. I buy whole beans, and use a Breville Oracle Touch. I‚Äôm also in Australia (Melbourne) if that makes a difference.

Because of being the only coffee drinker (unless we have guests) I only buy 250g bags (about 9oz) as all my local cafes/coffee roasters only sell 250g or 1kg bags. I go through the 250g bag in 1-2 weeks generally.

I used to buy, and would love to buy again, the 1kg bags due to being so much more cost effective, but it would take me over a month to go through. When I finally got around to having my ‚ÄòWhite Glove‚Äô Breville appointment the woman really explained the difference in how having beans fresh makes such a difference to the output, and I definitely noticed this comparing ~6 week old beans to fresh beans.

Will a coffee canister help keep it fresh/not degrade too much? Or not worth it and just keep buying the small bags? I have been looking into the Airscape. I currently store the beans in the bags they come in, and then that goes in an ‚Äòairtight‚Äô container. Probably need to Lee less in the hopper and top up more frequently!

I will drop a tldr for those who don't want to read my post, I told my family that I am looking for a partner to marry, but my sil kept hinting that I should marry her younger sister whenever she visited and she would most of the time talk about her, I confronted her and asked her and she told me that it's best if I marry her younger sister as it will strengthen our family.

So today I decided to talk to her, I called her up 2 hours ago to talk to her about this whole thing and clear things up.

When she arrived I gave her coffee and I Apologised, I said I am sorry for making you cry and I didn't want to hurt you, I said I truly felt like you are pressuring me into marriage cause you always bring her up everytime you get a chance and it was so constant that I felt like I am being pressured

I told her that marrying her younger sister is not a problem, being forced into is, Marriage is a life changing decision, I have always obeyed you and will always and if I do get married to her and it doesn't work out won't I and her sister suffer? 

She said she didn't want to pressure me she said she just thought that it would be better if we marry each other cause we know and can trust each other and there won't be any other outsiders in our family and it will work out just fine.

She said it's my decision and she would never force me but she thinks that I should atleast talk to her sister and try, if it works for us then it's good if it doesn't then that's okay as well.

I said I will think about it, I also need to talk to her sister, (which is also my sister but not blood related), she left after we hung out for an hour and I think we both have cleared it all up.

I think I have cleared it up with my sil, she's my sister and family and didn't want to hurt her in anyway, this time I tried my best to not be as dismissive and direct like last time and I think she understood where I am coming from.

So any opinions or helpful advice? ",6,1733649200.0,AITAH,8,0.8,False

I was set on the Lagom P64 and was getting ready to press the button (Merry Christmas to me) until I came across the Grind by Weight Mahlkonig E65s GBW. The work flow improvements offered by GBW is very appealing as I make 4 coffees per day (mostly milk but some straight espresso) and on the basis of ‚Äúbuy once cry once‚Äù, I‚Äôm seriously considering the Mahlkonig despite the circa. ¬£1k higher price tag. My wife will also be able to use without having to weigh out the beans for each coffee which she refuses to do. 
I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs a commercial grinder and is likely overkill for the kitchen setting but again GBW feature is overpowering this logic for me and the home grinders that offer GBW don‚Äôt appear to fit the endgame goal. 

My main questions for anyone who has experience or knowledge of both

- am I getting better espresso from the Mahlkonig or am I purely paying for the GBW feature? (Possibly less quality espresso?)
- does the Grind by weight benefits get outweighed by the additional retention in the Mahlkonig which may affect taste and dialling in. I‚Äôm prepared to do a purge at the start of each day to reduce this. 
- does the retention noticeably affect the taste and dialling in to the point that it becomes an annoying issue especially considering the price tag. If so does this mean I get better espresso with the Lagom P64 due to better consistency with the single dosing and almost zero retention 

Ultimately I want the best quality espresso with the smoothest/ easiest workflow, though taste probably outranks workflow so I‚Äôm happy to stick to single dosing if it makes for better tasting espresso. ",1,1733648429.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I went home the next day and kinda cut off contact for a few days, yesterday she asked me if I want to meet up for a coffee and I agreed again. It felt like I can‚Äòt really get through to her to talk about what happened and what it meant for both of us and she was kinda in a bad mood so I just ignored it. We both went to home after two hours and I really wanted to confess my feelings to her so I drunk texted her at 1 AM and asked her what it means to her and if she still has feelings for me. Probably wouldn‚Äòt have done that if I was sober but I guess it‚Äòs too late now. Anyways, I‚Äòm scared that she doesn‚Äòt feel the same as I do and that this is gonna ruin our relationship for good. I‚Äòm not ready for a normal friendship yet and I feel like the whole process of getting over her after the breakup has been reset and I‚Äòd probably cut off contact for good this time but that wouldn‚Äòt feel right either, can anyone relate? She hasn‚Äòt responded yet and I‚Äòm here spiralling in my own thoughts, I just want clarity.

You order a latte and you really get a strong but pleasant coffee taste, despite it having a lot of milk in it. 

Usually I get some regular espresso beans from the store which have at least a roast date on them, but these taste just like the regular coffee you get everywhere, bakery, gas station, what ever. The usual very dark, slightly burnt harsh coffee taste. 

When I got my machine I also bought a specialty coffee test pack. It was a collection of beans freshly roasted from different roasters. But there was somehow nothing in there, that I liked. I guess these were more of the experimental type, really fruity/sour and even natural beans, which were really unpleasant for me. 

How can I find beans, that are likely to be my taste? I'm looking around on [roastmarket.de](http://roastmarket.de) and they have some helpful indicators on how the beans could taste, but I'm not even sure what the coffee I'm looking for is classified as. I guess I should look in the chocolaty, nutty region as fruit stuff is probably the sour kind, but what about ""intensity"" and ""roast level""? Isn't that related? Should I look for intense coffee, that doesn't have a high roast level? Does the strong roast makes it the boring, usual gas station coffee? What is the difference between chocolaty/nutty/caramel/vanilla categories? I heard these are just synonyms for the kind of coffee and not really the taste in there, as fruits also just mean sour.

How do I stop this?,"Ugh. Here‚Äôs the deal. My ex and I were INCREDIBLY compatible in terms of personality, sex, humor, general attraction, etc. 

However, his work ethic wasn‚Äôt great. I have a pretty successful career and make around $500k/yr. When we were together, I only made around $40k/year, but I was on a clearly defined upward trajectory. 

He kind of lazed around - I don‚Äôt blame him, I would like to too. However, at the time, I wasn‚Äôt making enough to support both of us in Southern CA. He had dropped out of the university we met at due do not attending class and poor GPA. I encouraged him to go back and graduate, but that required me to complete all of his reentry paperwork for him and basically pretend to be him on the reentry application.

He did go back to school, but he never regained work ethic. He is an amazing person, but the first time we got into a minor argument and he put his fist through an IKEA coffee table, I decided that was it and called it quits. 

I started dating someone else quickly (a friend I had actually met before my ex). Things went well. We aren‚Äôt quite as naturally compatible in every area, but we have made every effort to learn more about each other and it works. He cares about me and takes care of me. We are both very successful and have built a nice life together.

My problem is that despite the fact that I broke up with my ex, I cannot seem to forget about him. I feel like I have let him go, but almost EVERY night, my dream is about him - often about me leaving my fiance for him. I wake up every morning and I have to snap myself out of it and remember how much I love my current life. And then it happens the next night. 

I do not want to be dreaming about him. He is a great person and I wish him the best, but we do not talk anymore and I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt know why he keeps being the subject of my dreams. I can‚Äôt make it stop and it‚Äôs messing with my connection to my amazing fiance. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to stop this. Any and all advice is appreciated!

I recently became sober and have been for 4 months now. During those four months I have been running on little sleep. Melatonin didn‚Äôt work, nyquil, Benadryl, etc.. Tylenol pm seemed to help but it would always take over an hour to almost two  hours for it to kick in. 

Once I finally got in to see a med provider she at first prescribed me clonidine. I have been prescribed it in the past and it worked fine until I got used to it. It wasn‚Äôt doing the job this time around, I found myself still taking Tylenol pm with it. She had me stop taking it and switched me over to Trazadone (100 mg). My PCP had predscribed (50mg) before until I could get in for my med appointment, and it did NOTHING. 

Tonight I took my trazadone (100mg) at 9:40 pm. It is now 2:40 am and I‚Äôm not even sleepy. I also take lamotrigine (100mg) at night because it is also supposed to make you drowsy.

 I have been absolutely MISERABLE these past four months. I miss smoking, it seemed like the only thing that helped me. I‚Äôm just trying to cope and deal with this sober now. I always take my medication around 9:30 PM every night but can never seem to fall asleep until after midnight and need a guided meditation or something to help.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Water fasting has gained attention in recent years as a method for improving health and longevity. One of the key benefits associated with water fasting is its ability to enhance autophagy. This natural process plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular health, which is vital for overall well-being. Understanding the synergy between water fasting, coffee, and autophagy can help you harness their combined benefits effectively.

Autophagy is a cellular mechanism by which the body cleanses and recycles damaged cells and proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function. Water fasting triggers autophagy by placing the body in a state of nutrient deprivation. During this time, cells begin to consume their own damaged parts as a survival strategy. Consequently, this leads to improved cell function, reduced inflammation, and potentially increased lifespan.

Coffee into your fasting routine may enhance the effects of autophagy. Research suggests that coffee can stimulate cellular processes that mimic the benefits of fasting. It is rich in antioxidants and can reduce inflammation, which complements the benefits of water fasting. However, it is crucial to consider how coffee is consumed during a fast.

- **Black Coffee:** Drinking black coffee can be a beneficial addition to water fasting. Since it contains no calories, it does not interfere with the fasting state. Black coffee can increase metabolic rate and even enhance fat oxidation.
- **Avoiding Additives:** It is essential to avoid sugar, cream, or flavored syrups while fasting, as these can break your fast and hinder the benefits of autophagy.
- **Timing:** Some people find that consuming coffee in moderation during the fasting period increases alertness and energy while still promoting autophagy.

Engaging in water fasting may offer a range of other health benefits in addition to enhancing autophagy. Here are some notable advantages:

- **Weight Loss:** Water fasting can lead to significant weight loss by promoting fat burning.
- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting may help regulate insulin levels and improve your body‚Äôs sensitivity to this hormone.
- **Heart Health:** Some studies suggest that water fasting can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, both of which are important for cardiovascular health.

To maximize the benefits of water fasting and autophagy, it is important to prepare adequately. Here are some strategies you can implement:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
1. **Gradual Adjustment:** If you are new to fasting, it's wise to start with intermittent fasting before progressing to longer water fasts.
2. **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water during your fast to stay hydrated, as this supports overall bodily function.

By strategically using water fasting and coffee together, you can enhance autophagy and promote overall health effectively. The combination can empower your body to detoxify, regenerate, and rejuvenate itself, leading to improved well-being and longevity.

How Coffee Consumption During Fasting Affects Autophagy
-------------------------------------------------------

When you think about fasting, the focus might usually be on abstaining from food and the potential health benefits that come along with it. One interesting aspect is how drinks like coffee can play a role during water fasting and how this interacts with a process known as autophagy. Autophagy is your body's way of cleaning out damaged cells, which can lead to improved cellular health. The question becomes: how does drinking coffee during a fasting period affect autophagy?

### Understanding Water Fasting

Water fasting is when you consume nothing but water for a set period, aiming to give your body time to detoxify and rest from constant digestion. Many people practice water fasting for various reasons, including weight loss, improved metabolism, and enhanced mental clarity. This fasting method pushes your body into a state of ketosis, which influences how your cells behave.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Role of Autophagy

Autophagy is triggered when your body is under stress from starvation, helping to break down and recycle cellular components. This process is essential for maintaining cellular health and may even have anti-aging effects. It helps remove toxins and refocuses energy toward the repair and regeneration of cells.

### How Coffee Comes into Play

Coffee is a widely consumed beverage that many people enjoy, even during fasting. Drinking coffee during water fasting is often debated. Some argue it can break a fast, while others believe it can enhance the benefits of fasting, particularly with autophagy. Here's how:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Caffeine and Autophagy:** Research suggests that caffeine might stimulate autophagy. Caffeine can increase energy turnover, which may enhance the breakdown of cellular components.
- **Effects on Insulin:** Coffee can help minimize insulin levels, keeping your body in a fasting mode. Lower insulin levels can promote fat burning and encourage the process of autophagy.
- **Antioxidants:** Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can help reduce oxidative stress in your cells, potentially allowing autophagy to function more effectively.

### The Balance of Benefits and Considerations

While coffee does provide some potential benefits during fasting, it‚Äôs important to consider how it may affect you personally. Here are some factors to keep in mind:

- **Stomach Sensitivity:** Some people may find that coffee on an empty stomach causes discomfort or gastrointestinal issues. It‚Äôs vital to listen to your body.
- **Hydration:** Coffee has a mild diuretic effect, which could lead to dehydration if you're not consuming enough water. Make sure you stay well-hydrated!
- **Mindful Consumption:** Moderation is key. Too much caffeine can lead to jitters or heightened anxiety, which may counteract the mental clarity that fasting often provides.

### Personal Experience and Recommendations

Many people incorporate coffee into their fasting routine and report positive experiences. If you decide to try it out, start with a small amount. Monitor how it affects your energy levels and overall fasting experience. If you notice adverse effects, consider reducing your intake or opting for decaffeinated alternatives.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Combining coffee with your water fasting regimen ultimately comes down to individual tolerance and preference. You‚Äôll want to focus on how caffeine affects your body during the fasting period. Some people find that it boosts their experience, while others may feel it disrupts the benefits of fasting.

### Final Thoughts on Coffee and Fasting

Drinking coffee during water fasting could offer you several benefits, specifically concerning autophagy. While it appears that coffee may stimulate autophagy, personal tolerance and habits play a significant role in determining if it enhances or detracts from the fasting experience. Stay aware of your body's signals and make informed choices based on your reactions.

The Science Behind Autophagy: Benefits and Mechanisms
-----------------------------------------------------

Autophagy is a natural process in the body that promotes cellular health by recycling damaged or unneeded components. Understanding the science behind this process can help you unlock numerous health benefits. Here‚Äôs an overview of how autophagy works and why it matters for your overall well-being.

### What is Autophagy?

Autophagy, derived from the Greek word meaning ""self-eating,"" is a crucial cellular cleaning mechanism. It helps remove dysfunctional proteins and organelles, allowing cells to maintain homeostasis. By breaking down and recycling cellular materials, autophagy supports cellular regeneration and improves overall function.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Mechanisms of Autophagy

At its core, autophagy involves several key steps:

1. **Activation:** Stressors like fasting or nutrient deprivation can trigger autophagy.
2. **Formation:** Membranes wrap around the cellular debris to form autophagosomes.
3. **Fusion:** Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, where enzymes break down the contents.
4. **Recycling:** The resulting metabolites are released back into the cytoplasm for reuse.

This process not only cleans up damaged cells but also aids in energy production during times of stress, making it essential for survival.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Water fasting has gained popularity for its perceived health benefits. However, several myths surround this practice, clouding people's understanding of what water fasting truly entails. Let‚Äôs explore these misconceptions to help you make informed choices.

### Myth 1: Water Fasting is Just for Weight Loss

Many people embark on water fasting expecting to shed pounds quickly. While weight loss can occur, it's not the sole benefit. Water fasting initiates a process called autophagy, where your body cleans out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. This cellular repair is crucial for long-term health, going beyond mere aesthetic goals.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 2: You Will Lose Muscle Mass

A common fear is that water fasting leads to muscle loss. While it‚Äôs true that the body breaks down muscle tissue for energy during extended fasts, the body prioritizes fat as a primary energy source first. Studies indicate that when done correctly, water fasting can help preserve muscle mass, especially if followed periodically rather than continuously.

### Myth 3: Water Fasting is Dangerous

Some people believe that fasting can lead to severe health complications. While water fasting isn‚Äôt suitable for everyone, many healthy individuals can fast safely. It‚Äôs essential to listen to your body. If you experience symptoms like dizziness, extreme fatigue, or dehydration, consider breaking your fast. Consulting a healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast is wise, especially for those with underlying health conditions.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 4: You Cannot Drink Anything Other Than Water

While the name ""water fasting"" implies only water is allowed, there's some flexibility. Herbal teas and black coffee are often acceptable options. Both can help with hydration and may even enhance the fasting experience. Black coffee, in particular, has its own health benefits, such as improving metabolism and supporting cognitive function during fasting periods.

### Myth 5: Fasting Slows Down Your Metabolism

There is a belief that fasting causes your metabolism to slow significantly. Research shows that short-term fasting can actually increase metabolic rate due to the release of norepinephrine. This hormone helps break down fat and uses it as fuel. Therefore, if done correctly, water fasting can be effective for boosting your metabolism.

### The Benefits of Water Fasting

Now that we've debunked some common myths, let‚Äôs highlight the potential benefits of water fasting:

- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting can enhance your body's ability to respond to insulin. This is beneficial for managing blood sugar levels.
- **Cellular Repair:** As mentioned, autophagy plays a significant role in repairing damaged cells, potentially reducing the risk of various diseases.
- **Enhanced Mental Clarity:** Many individuals report improved focus and mental clarity while fasting, likely due to reduced fluctuations in blood sugar.
- **Hormonal Balance:** Fasting can lead to hormonal changes that may help with fat loss and overall health.

### Myth 6: Fasting is Only for the Unhealthy

### Myth 7: Water Fasting is a Quick Fix

Many may view water fasting as a shortcut to health. However, sustainable health is a long-term commitment that involves balanced nutrition and regular physical activity. Water fasting can be a helpful tool, but it should complement a healthy lifestyle rather than replace it.

Understanding the truths behind water fasting can help you unlock its full potential. As you explore this practice, remember that individual experiences may vary. Always prioritize your health and well-being, and consider professional advice when needed.

Practical Tips for Combining Water Fasting and Coffee for Optimal Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people are turning to water fasting, a method known for its numerous health benefits, including weight loss and improved metabolic health. Combining water fasting with coffee can enhance these benefits, but it requires careful consideration. Here are practical tips to help you manage this combination effectively.

### Understand the Benefits of Water Fasting

Water fasting involves abstaining from all food and beverages except water. During this period, your body initiates autophagy, a process that cleans out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. When done correctly, water fasting can:

- Boost metabolism
- Enhance mental clarity
- Support weight loss
- Improve cellular repair
- Promote insulin sensitivity

### The Role of Coffee in Water Fasting

When you drink black coffee during a water fast, it can offer additional benefits:

- Increases alertness and focus due to caffeine
- Suppresses appetite, making it easier to stick to your fasting window
- Aids in fat burning because it encourages your body to use fat as fuel
- Provides antioxidants, which can support your overall health

### Choosing the Right Coffee

Not all coffee is created equal, especially when you're fasting. Here are some tips for selecting the best coffee:

- **Opt for organic coffee:** Choosing organic ensures that your coffee beans are free from harmful pesticides and chemicals.
- **Go for dark roasts:** Dark roasted coffee typically has lower acidity, which can be gentler on your stomach during fasting.
- **Avoid added sugars and creams:** Stick to black coffee to maximize the benefits of your water fast.

### Timing Your Coffee Intake

The timing of your coffee consumption can also impact your fast:

- **Drink coffee in moderation:** One or two cups can support your fast, but too much caffeine may lead to jitteriness or headaches.
- **Incorporate coffee earlier in the day:** Caffeine can disrupt your sleep if consumed later, which is crucial for recovery and wellness.

### Listening to Your Body

While coffee can complement water fasting, it is essential to listen to your body:

- If you start feeling anxious or jittery, cut back on your coffee intake.
- Stay hydrated: Ensure you‚Äôre drinking enough water to balance the dehydrating effects of caffeine.
- Pace yourself: If you're new to fasting or coffee consumption, start slow and gradually increase your intake.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

As beneficial as combining water fasting and coffee can be, there are some pitfalls to watch out for:

- **Ineffective hydration:** Sometimes, people overlook their water intake while focusing on coffee. Make sure to drink plenty of water.
- **Over-caffeination:** Consuming too much coffee can lead to dehydration, anxiety, and sleep issues.
- **Using coffee as a meal replacement:** Remember, coffee should only supplement your fasting; it‚Äôs not a substitute for food.

### Enhancing Your Fasting Routine

To maximize the benefits of water fasting and coffee, consider these additional strategies:

- Incorporate light exercise: Gentle activities like walking or stretching during fasting can boost your metabolism.
- Practice mindfulness: Meditation and deep-breathing exercises can enhance mental clarity and help navigate hunger pangs.
- Keep a journal: Tracking your fasting experience, coffee intake, and how you feel can help you adjust and improve your routine.

Combining water fasting and coffee offers a powerful approach to enhance your health and wellbeing. By following these practical tips, you can navigate the fasting process more effectively and enjoy the myriad benefits that come with it. Always remember to listen to your body and consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your fasting or coffee intake.

### Conclusion

Water fasting, when practiced correctly, offers a remarkable way to enhance autophagy and improve your overall health. As you have learned, this process helps your body remove damaged cells and regenerate new ones, leading to better physical and mental wellness. Combining coffee with water fasting can amplify these benefits. The caffeine in coffee can provide an energy boost and help suppress appetite while still allowing your body to enter a fasting state and reap the rewards of autophagy.

Understanding the science behind autophagy reveals its critical role in cellular repair and longevity. It's important to debunk common myths surrounding water fasting, as these misconceptions can deter individuals from experiencing these health benefits. For instance, many people worry that fasting is inherently harmful, while in reality, when done mindfully, it can be incredibly beneficial.

If you're considering incorporating coffee into your water fasting routine, remember practical tips to maximize results. Start with black coffee to avoid additional calories, hydrate adequately, and listen to your body's signals. This balanced approach ensures that you can enjoy the advantages of both water fasting and coffee without compromising your health.

It's been a while. Alam ko na medyo dumidistansya ka na sakin when I told you I am planning to leave the company. Alam mo, ikaw yung isa mga nilolook forward kong makita pag pumapasok ako sa work. The day na nakita kita, hanggang sa naging magkawork tayo. Then naging magkaibigan at naging super close. Lahat yun nakatatak sakin. 


Gusto ko lang malaman mo na, the first time I saw you, na felt a familiar feeling. Na parang ""Oh, hi, ang tagal kitang hinanap. Ito ka na pala"". I dont know what kind of feeling I felt that day. Pero ang gaan. It feels like home. Then, naging mapaglaro yung destiny, ginawa tayong workmates turned to super close friend.


You were so masungit sa lahat. But I remembered you saying ako yung exemption. When we were together, as if everyone around us doesn't exist. Pag nasa car tayo, or even outside sipping our coffees without saying a word, parang ang payapa. You've been exerting efforts na sabi nila di daw ginagawa ng normal na kaibigan. You even remember even the smallest details about me. I know you care for me. Ramdam ko yun.  But never ako nag ask if ano ba ako sayo. Kasi parang di ko kaya ano man ang maging sagot mo. 



Remember, when you celebrated your birthday with me and our other friend ? They say you only celebrate your birthday with the people you love. Mahal mo ba ako? 


Even our friends are saying na nakakalungkot ka daw. Na parang wala kang lakas na loob sabihin sakin na mahalaga ako sayo with the efforts you've shown, lalo na sa mga darkest moments ko, and ang tagal tagal mo namang hugutin yang lakas na loob na kelangan mo. 


Beh, I know ang daming rumors about us sa workplace. Pero binibrush off mo lang yun. Wala ka namang pakialam sa kanila eh.


Sana I can keep you forever. I know things are complicated right now, pero sana malaman mo na I want the best for you. Sana dumating yung point na masabi ko sayo na mahal kita and kung magmamahal ako ulit, ikaw na yung mamahalin ko at kasama kong tumanda. Mag iingat ka palagi.

I am in one of those strange, amorphous mindscapes that I so often encounter while dreaming: a mall or other large commercial location that becomes an entirely different scape with the turning of a corner or egress through a door. Ex: I‚Äôm wandering through a mall, turn a corner, then find that I am in the detached garage at my grandparent‚Äôs summer home in Goshen, NJ.

Anyway, in my dream last night, I found myself in one of the aforementioned and nebulously defined environments. This time, I am standing in the back of a church basement, making myself a cup of coffee. It‚Äôs clear that I am at a 12-Step meeting, with one person up at the front of the room, dressed in casual attire (white t-shirt with a design I either can‚Äôt remember or couldn‚Äôt make out and, I‚Äôm assuming, blue jeans), and telling their story of Experience, Strength, and Hope. Anyone who‚Äôs been to an AA meeting will know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. They may not even need to read the rest of the description of my environment to envision a location in which the coming events could take place. As is common for my dreams, I hear speech, but can only make sense of phrasal odds & ends‚Äîa word here, half a sentence there. The audience is rapt, hardly daring to blink or breathe for fear of interrupting the vocal spell being cast by the speaker.

I notice that there is an uncommon number of children among the crowd. There are sometimes one or two children, wreaking quiet havoc or playing games on tablets, but in this dream it appears as though as much as fifty percent have their children in tow. This in itself is not particularly alarming, just strange.

The coffee station in the dream AA meeting is no different from the dozens of others I‚Äôve encountered over the past few years. With its large steel electric coffee urn, stack of possibly the smallest Styrofoam cups allowed by Galactic law (roughly half the size of what most adult Americans would consider a normal cup size, and *always* Styrofoam), one of the foam cups filled with granulated sugar set into hard brown clumps as a result of people stirring their coffee with the ubiquitous plastic spoon then placing it immediately back into the sugar, all set atop a faux wood-grain folding table.

As previously mentioned, I am at the described coffee station, making myself a cup of usually surprisingly good coffee. (F.N.: I have theories as to just why it is that AA meetings typically have above subpar coffee, the most logical being that the coffee urns, receiving no more than a cursory rinse at the end of each meeting, have an effect on the flavor, just as the seasoning of a cast iron skillet or wok effects the flavor of the food cooked in it. But I digress. Again.)

I‚Äôve always been a cream and sugar person. That‚Äôs how I experienced coffee for the firt time, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve consumed it since, with the exception of a period of just a few weeks in my early thirties when I drank it black for no reason more significant than just wanting to try something differently. In my dream, I fill my cup with coffee, add a spoonful of sugar, then go to add some of the non-dairy creamer that‚Äôs usually available in one of the foam cups right next to the sugar. Only this time, instead of being filled with a reasonable amount of the whitish powder, it is overflowing, sitting in a pile of the stuff. The cup literally runneth over. For reasons I did not at the time, and still don‚Äôt, understand, I find that I am wary of this sight, as one may be wary of a stray dog. There is now not a spoon to be found on or about the table. I look behind the urn, under the table, in my pockets: nothing. But I know that \*simply must\* add creamer to my coffee. I have no choice in the matter. It must absolutely be done. Not adding creamer to this particular cup of coffee has, in the context of the dream, dire/unknown and therefore possibly life-threatening consequences.

Meanwhile, the bits & bobs I‚Äôve been hearing of the speaker‚Äôs story have ceased. A venomous silence has fallen over the room. I turn to investigate, to see what might have prompted this sudden silence, and find that everyone in the church basement is staring at me. Not just the adults; the children are watching, goggle-eyed, as well.A few among the populous whisper to one another while keeping their eyes firmly on me, sopeaking from the corners of their mouths. My anxiety rises several notches.

Although I don‚Äôt typically have Lucid Dreams, I become aware that it‚Äôs entirely possible that I may be in the midst of a classic Naked-in-Public dream, but when I look down, I am fully clothed. All the same, this does nothing to assuage the steadily mounting fear and trepidation building in my mind and heart. At this point, I can only assume that they are watching and waiting for me to/to see if or how I add the creamer to my coffee. Again, my anxiety increases. It hasn‚Äôt yet reached a point of criticality, though I can tell that that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs headed, based on past experience.

I turn back to the table, cup in hand, even though I distinctly remember leaving it on the table before turning to inspect the crowd. This time, there‚Äôs no creamer, non-dairy or otherwise, anywhere in sight. The table is entirely barren, save for a white plastic spoon set parallel to the length of the table. The sight of the empty table is somewhat relieving. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôve been absolved of my creamer-adding duties by some benign beverage-base deity. (F.N.: I have a memory of being told by my father one summer afternoon in my thirteenth or fourteenth year that I was to learn how to use the lawnmower the following morning. I spent the rest of that afternoon/evening in an anxious daze because, at the time, I had something of a phobia of gas-powered machinery. My relief the following morning when I woke up and saw that we were being hit by torrential rains was such that I can still recall that visceral sense of relief in decent detail. My point here is that I experienced a similar breed of relief upon discovering that the coffee creamer had gone missing that I felt back in ‚Äò99/‚Äô00 when the lawn mowing lesson had been delayed.)

This is where the serious surreality kicks off. Staring at the suddenly barren table, foam cup in hand, I feel a tug at the back of my shirt. I turn and see a little blonde girl in a blue and white checkered Little Debbie‚Ñ¢dress proffering a cardboard pint of Half&Half. Not an eye has wandered from me and my plight. My fear, anxiety, and relief are now melding into an odd pseudo-emotion I am at a complete loss to describe with any accuracy. I turn back to the table, set the cup down on the faux wood surface, twist off the half & half‚Äôs plastic cap, and pour a dollop into the black coffee. I reach for the spoon to stir it up. An angry male voice shouts, ‚Äú\*What the hell was THAT\*?‚Äù

I freeze.

An equally angry female voice then adds, ‚Äú\*Does this guy even know what he‚Äôs doing\*?‚Äù

Stasis intact, I second guess my actions. Did I do that correctly? What did I do wrong here?

More cries of contention arise from the ever watchful crowd, all voicing convictions to the effect that I‚Äôve added the creamer incorrectly and haven‚Äôt the foggiest clue as to what I‚Äôm doing. The amorphous pseudo-emotion transforms quickly into firm, unalloyed terror. I cannot speak, and therefore can‚Äôt counter the crowd‚Äôs arguments or defend myself. I look like an idiot. There‚Äôs no way I look like anything but a complete ineffectual moron. Confused and beginning to feel the cyclonic swirl of anxiety-induced disorientation, I do the only thing that seems to make any sense.I pour more half & half into my cup, an action met by some positive reactions from the crowd. Cries of ‚Äú\*There you go\*,‚Äù and, ‚Äú‚Äù\*Now we‚Äôre talkin‚Äô\*,‚Äù and the like emanate from the crowd like deconstructed atoms from a fissile core. When I stop pouring, the negative comments regarding my creamer-related aptitude resume. There is no no more than a quarter-inch of room left in the cup. If I add much more half & half, I won‚Äôt be able to pick up the cup without spilling it, but still the catcalling and ridicule come. The crowd begins to chant (F.N.: One thing I learned from this dream is that hearing large groups of people chanting, whether directed at me or not, prompts a serious phobic reaction in me), but there‚Äôs no uniformity in the act, as is the norm for chanting crowds; it sound as if there are different factions within the group calling out their own individual slogans, equating to a maelstrom of indeterminate vocalizations, none of which sound very encouraging. Or, at least, encouraging of anything that made sense to me. Imagine standing in the middle of a stadium filled with people who hate your guts. Each one of them is equipped with a megaphone and ceaselessly spouting personalized vitriol in unison. That is as accurate an approximation as I can convey without divulging (or \*indulging\*) vast quantities of abstract, nonsensical verbiage.

For some unknown span of characteristically elastic Dream Time, I absorb the barbs, the digs, the slings and arrows; my distressed perplexity mounts ever higher. In an attempt to quell the chaos, I begin pouring more creamer into the cup. Coffee and creamer run over the rim of the cup and onto the tabletop. Instantly, as if some Frankensteinian Lever has been pulled, the chiding ceases and become cheers, encouragement, applause, laughter. The AA attendees are losing their ever-loving minds. \*This\* is what they‚Äôve wanted from me the whole time, what they‚Äôve been waiting and watching for. I pour and pour, periodically looking over my shoulder at the ecstatic crowd. When the cardboard pint is empty, a man departs briefly from the crowd to clap me on the shoulder, congratulate me, and hand me another carton of creamer. I begin pouring this into the cup as well. The coffee has long since departed the cup, washed away by a tsunami of half & half, leaving behind only specter of pallid beige to evidence its one-time existence. The table and floor are now home to puddles of coffee-laced half & half. I empty a second carton, a third, a fifth (there is no fourth carton‚ÄîI go straight from number three to number five) all the while the crowd behind me cheers and shouts fervently in support of my actions. I was born for this, made to do this; generations have passed, awaiting my arrival. I am the Pourer of Creamer, a King by my Own Rite. The cosmos begins to deflate around me. I want to drop the creamer and run, but there is no stopping this foretold event. I must pour the creamer, I must not stop. The universe begins to speed up like a VHS tape on Fast-Forward, faster and faster until all that exists, has existed, or ever will exist becomes one uniform blur of light and life and pain and pleasure.

the naughty:

\- the lady who stood at my register for 5 minutes trying to figure out how to use an un-activated gift card cos she decided after i was done scanning to use a gift card instead of her usual bank card. like lady, she had 5 minutes to decide in the line, another few to decide while i was scanning. this was on a busy saturday afternoon, mind you, and the line was building up behind her.

\- the lady who tried (and succeeded) to return a used dog brush? she bought the brush last week, used it once on her dog who 'didn't like it' - we accept change of mind refunds (we are not legally required to in my country but it is our policy to do so, she tried to argue it was illegal for us not to give the refund which isn't true) but only for goods in original packaging and unused. there was a clump of dog hair on it and she didn't even have the fucking receipt (it was less than 10 bucks btw, not even something hella fancy) 

\- the lady who declined a coin i gave her as change because it was 'dirty' ??? money is money mate and the register was closed by the time she complained and i had to get my supervisor to open the drawer for the equivalent of 30 cents USD

\- the man who ignored me when i told him we were closing in 5 minutes and took his sweet sweet time trying his 20 shirts in the fitting room such that we closed 10 minutes later than we shouldve

\- the 2 girls who tried on a bunch of clothes and came out the fitting room without them. when i asked them where their clothes were they stared at me blankly as if to say 'we have to bring them out? we thought the help did that'. finally got them to bring them out and they dumped them all on my table sans hangers and inside out

\- the dad who let his 2 children play with all the noise-making toys in the toy section and didn't tell them to put anything back on the shelf, leaving them scattered all over the floor

\- the lady who just said 'bag' at me and physically dragged me to our handbag section so i could retrieve a locked handbag for her, patted my arm to call me a 'good kid' before deciding she didn't want the bag after all halfway in the queue

\- the lady who threw up a stink at the fact that we ran out of wrapping paper for all the breakables we sell (its christmas, theres a lot of snow globes and mugs being wrapped) and told us it was an 'essential service she expected as a paying customer'

\- the lady who accused staff of stealing her handbag when she couldn't find it - turns out she left it in the fitting room (she was lucky no one stole it when it was left unattended)

(dis)honorable mention those who

\- separated shoes from their pair and dumped them haphazardly on the floor

\- moved my wet floor sign just because??? did they think we just put it there for the atmosphere?

\- left coffee/smoothie/bubble tea cups all over the store

\- left clothing on top of the clothing racks leaving them to become entangled with other hangers

the nice:

\- the mum who told her kid to say 'thank you' and 'bye' after their transaction

\- the nervous ish teens who come in and its clearly one of their first times shopping alone - theyre pretty much always polite and chill

the ehh:

\- the people who said 'busy, eh?' yeah no shit ive been standing here for 4 straight hours and my throat hurts from putting on a fake happy/nice voice without more than 2 sips of water cos y'all keep coming

\- the people who also said 'hot, eh?' again im in the same room as you we're all sweaty, we all feel the lack of air con

\- the people who joke 'i sure hope so' when i tell them underwear can't be returned (ive heard it a million times, ha ha)

The doors opened and guests streamed in for one of the most anticipated bookings of the season, as the stakes were higher than at any point yet, with black jackets on the line. To up the ante further, both teams would be serving VIPs at their chef tables. In the blue kitchen, they would be serving the legendary voice actor Dee Bradley Baker, while the red kitchen would be serving WNBA basketball superstar Caitlin Clark.¬†

In the blue kitchen, Tami would be working appetizers while Stefan was working fish. For their first ticket, Ramsay gave them the VIP order for Dee Bradley Baker‚Äôs table, which was one risotto, one capellini, two scallops, as he again urged Stefan to live up to the black jacket he was wearing.. Right away, Stefan and Tami would start communicating with each other effortlessly, with Tami saying in her confessional that even though Stefan had denied her a black jacket in the challenge, she wasn‚Äôt going to hold that against him, and was determined to prove to Ramsay why she deserved to be in the top tier of the competition. Soon, Stefan and Tami would bring the VIP order up to the pass, with Ramsay approving everything and telling them that he wanted that same standard upheld all night. While Dee Bradley Baker and his family were enjoying their appetizers, Tami and Stefan were now focusing on serving all of their remaining tables. With the communication still pitch perfect, they soon had food flying out into the dining room, pleasing Ramsay, and before long, the blue team was ready to start firing entrees alongside their remaining appetizers, starting with the VIP table. With LaMont on meat now entering the action, Ramsay called out the first ticket as one Wellington, one chicken, and two halibut. With LaMont seamlessly merging his voice with Tami and Stefan, the trio were able to deliver their food to the hot plate within a few minutes, where it was again all approved by Ramsay. Baker and his family were seen enjoying their entrees while the blue team returned its focus to the kitchen, with LaMont saying in his confessional that the three of them were unstoppable when they got in a groove.¬†

In the red kitchen, it was up to Natasha on apps and Johnny on fish to get them off to the right start. For the first ticket, which was for the VIP table, Ramsay called out risotto and two scallops, getting a good response from Natasha and Johnny. They had less success communicating well with each other, however, as Johnny tried to call out his times, only to be immediately overruled by Natasha, with Johnny expressing annoyance in his confessional at this. Making matters worse, as the order arrived at the pass, Natasha had served one properly cooked risotto and one burnt one, while Johnny served an order rubbery scallops that Ramsay compared to bullets. Ramsay told them both to get it the fuck together because he was not doing this tonight. Natasha said in her confessional that Johnny was just showing why he didn‚Äôt belong in the elite of this competition. Fortunately, on their second try, they did manage to get the order accepted, and soon, they were moving on to the rest of the dining room. However, after a few tables had gone by without incident, Natasha served up undercooked capellini, much to Ramsay‚Äôs chagrin, as he told her that she should know how to cook pasta by this point. Despite this setback, Natasha managed to recover, and with Johnny also serving nicely cooked scallops, the red team was eventually ready to get started on entrees alongside their remaining apps. Ingram was now in the spotlight on meat as Ramsay called out the first entree ticket, which was Caitlin Clark‚Äôs table. Blake said in her confessional that she was a huge fan of Clark and they absolutely could not screw this up. While everything seemed to be going well, once the chefs brought their orders up, Ramsay called the team over and told them to touch Johnny‚Äôs salmon, with everyone confirming that it was raw. Ramsay crushed the salmon in anger as he said this was not what he expected chefs competing for black jackets to serve to his VIPs

Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen, the trio of chefs were well into entrees, with LaMont serving up perfect chicken and wellingtons, while Stefan was sending out both fish entrees and the remaining orders of scallops along with Tami‚Äôs appetizers. Stefan said in his confessional that this reminded him of the very first service, where he, Finley and Ren√©e had served the entire dining room themselves. LaMont expressed similar thoughts in his confessional, saying everyone was locked in right now, and it was the same feeling as when your favorite song played on the radio: pure euphoria. Ramsay was impressed, as he told them not to start shitting themselves, but this was one of the best services he had yet seen in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. Tami said in her confessional that it was almost intimidating to be so close to the end, yet still know that even a single mistake could bring everything to a screeching halt. Despite this, the blue team would continue to power through like a well-oiled machine, with Ramsay praising Tami‚Äôs perfect risottos as they finished appetizers. With apps done, Tami would move to garnish to free up Stefan to focus on fish, and with the confidence at an all-time high, the blue team was soon nearing the finish line, as Ramsay said this was their last ticket, and urged them to close strong. Tami said it was time to go and get these black jackets, with LaMont responding to her energy with an enthusiastic ‚Äúyes, chef!‚Äù, and together, the blue team managed to get their last entree ticket up, which was accepted by Ramsay. Soon after, they would send out their desserts and complete service, with Ramsay saying he was proud of all of them tonight.¬†

Back in the red kitchen, Johnny was now attempting to bounce back from his raw salmon, with Ramsay urging him to hurry up. Eventually, Johnny would bring it up, with Ramsay accepting it and telling Blake to deliver the food to Caitlin Clark. Blake said in her confessional that this was almost as good as winning Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, as Caitlin Clark was the reason she even became a fan of the WNBA, and her excitement would be very plain to see, as she stopped to tell Clark that it was an honor just to be standing close to her. This would be interrupted by Ramsay saying that Blake could ask for autographs later, and to get back on her section. Natasha said in her confessional that Blake was just too immature to run a kitchen, as she had known all along. With the VIP table finally served, the red team would move on to the rest of the dining room, but would soon run into more troubles as Johnny later served two perfect halibut when only one was one order, while Blake served cold Wellington sauce and suddenly went quiet when Johnny was trying to communicate with her. Johnny said in his confessional that he was worried about Blake because she looked rattled right now, and would continue trying to ask her how long, before Ingram finally stepped in and urged Blake not to give up, as they needed her to drive the tickets. Blake said in her confessional that she‚Äôd let events tonight throw her off her game, and couldn‚Äôt let those mental mistakes take her out of the competition. With Blake finally responding and delivering perfect garnish, the red team seemed to get back on track, however, their momentum would be stopped yet again as Natasha served up mushy risotto, pissing Ramsay off as this was one of the most basic of HK dishes. With both Johnny and Blake seemingly unsure of what tickets they were on, Ingram would step up and give them the information they needed, while also serving perfectly cooked chicken and wellingtons, earning Ramsay‚Äôs praise for his leadership. Ingram said in his confessional that his arm still hurt like hell from the punishment and the strain of working meat, but that wasn‚Äôt going to stop him now. Eventually, the red team managed to fight through their struggles and send out their remaining entrees and desserts, completing their final service as a team.

**Post-Mortem**

Ramsay told the teams that tonight, he wanted to see each and every one of them prove why they deserved black jackets as individuals, however, he also still expected to see teamwork, because even when the red and blue were no more, there would still be the black jacket team, and he needed to know that he could trust the chefs to work as part of brigade. With that, he said there was one team that clearly exemplified that spirit tonight, and that was the blue team. Ramsay said that was about as close to perfection as he had ever seen in all his years of running Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, and there was no question that it was a black jacket worthy performance. With that, he told LaMont and Tami to step forward. First, he told LaMont that when he first walked through that door as a DJ-turned-chef, he hadn‚Äôt expected much of anything, but LaMont had absolutely proven him wrong day after day, and week after week. LaMont was absolutely ecstatic in his confessional, saying that this black jacket symbolized his dream, and no matter how tall the odds, as long as he was still in it, he had no doubt he could win it all. Then, Ramsay told Tami that she had persevered through tremendous personal loss and displayed the professionalism and standards that would make any kitchen lucky to have her. Tami said in her confessional that her inner strength was more than she would have ever realized if not for Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, and the black jacket was just another sign of how far she had come in more ways than one.¬†

With three jackets handed out, Ramsay told the red team that he was only giving out three more, which meant one of them was going home tonight. With that, he told them to get back upstairs and consider very carefully everything that had occurred tonight and throughout the season, then return with the two chefs whom they felt did not deserve to wear a black jacket. As for the blue team, he told them to follow Jon, who would take them to the Black Jacket Lounge.¬†

Back in the dorms, on the red team‚Äôs side, Natasha started off by saying that it was pretty clear to her who the two nominees should be, and that was Johnny and Blake, as they both screwed the kitchen at multiple points tonight. Johnny shot back that while he may have had his mistakes, Natasha‚Äôs stubbornness and refusal to respect her brigade were ultimately traits that made her unfit for the head chef position. Natasha became upset as she told Johnny he didn‚Äôt know the first thing about being a line cook, let alone a head chef. Ingram pleaded with them to calm down as they needed to come to a decision, and said that he was personally putting up Natasha because throughout the competition, she had always put her self interest above the team, and that wasn‚Äôt what HK Foxwoods needed. For his second nominee, he was stuck between Johnny and Blake, because he felt that Blake had a strong finish, but struggled early in the night, while Johnny just had a few too many bumps overall. Blake accepted that she didn‚Äôt have the best service, but she did feel that she finished strong, and would have to nominate Natasha and Johnny. WIth Natasha at three votes, Johnny at two, and Blake at one, there was still potential for things to change due to Ingram being undecided, however, there was another development occurring, as Johnny was talking to Blake privately and said that it was time for them to take the kid gloves off with Natasha and start playing this strategically, as he said he was putting himself up, because he felt he had a better chance to survive against Natasha. Blake asked if he was crazy, and said there was no way he should put himself at risk like that. Johnny admitted it was unorthodox, but it might be their best chance to ensure everyone but Natasha got a black jacket. Blake asked if they could at least talk to Ingram, as he would probably know what to do, but Johnny said he wasn‚Äôt telling anyone else, because he didn‚Äôt want Natasha to possibly get wind of it.¬†

Meanwhile, the blue team had been led upstairs by Jon towards the newly opened Black Jacket Lounge, where they were amazed to find a stunningly decorated room with a bar, a banner welcoming them, and a bucket of iced champagne bottles on the coffee table, along with a note from Ramsay, which was read by LaMont, revealing it congratulated them on getting their black jackets and encouraged them to celebrate, because they earned it. Tami said it was such a relief to finally be in a black jacket, and she could only imagine what her parents would say. Stefan said he was sure they would be very proud, just as he hoped his immigrant parents would be. LaMont said nobody back home was going to believe this, and he was loving every minute of it. The three black jackets popped a bottle open and toasted to sending the blue team off the right way.¬†

**Elimination Ceremony**

The red team entered the dining room and lined up in front of Ramsay, as he reminded them that they had been through hell and back more than once just to get this far, and that was why it was so hard now for him to know that he had to say goodbye to one talented chef. With that said, he called on Johnny, asking for the red team‚Äôs first nominee and why. Johnny announced that the team had voted for Natasha, because her overall record throughout the competition showed she lacked the leadership quality needed to run a brigade effectively. Ramsay asked for the second nominee and why. Johnny hesitated for a moment before replying that‚Ä¶

He was the second nominee. Ramsay asked why. Johnny announced that the team felt that he was too inconsistent, both tonight and throughout the competition. Ramsay considered it for a moment then accepted the nominations, telling both chefs to step forward.¬†

*Deliberation music*

Ramsay first asked Natasha why she deserved a black jacket.

Natasha: ‚ÄúI deserve a black jacket, chef, because I‚Äôve been a fighter from day one. I know what it takes to be the head chef you need. I got the voice to run any brigade, there‚Äôs no one standing behind me that can run Hk Foxwoods better than I can.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúYou talk the talk as well as anyone, Natasha, but at this point, I‚Äôm concerned about whether you can walk the walk. I see the potential, but how do I know you‚Äôll support your brigade when times get tough?‚Äù

Next, Ramsay asked Johnny why he deserved a black jacket.¬†

Johnny: ‚ÄúI deserve a black jacket because you know more than anyone not to judge someone by outward appearances. I‚Äôve been underestimated in this industry. People always doubt me, but I always find a way to get the job done, and that‚Äôs what I feel like I‚Äôve done here, chef. Every time I‚Äôve been counted out, I‚Äôve fought back.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThat fighting spirit, that determination, is what I admire about you, Johnny, but at this point in the competition, it‚Äôs not just about being the scrappy underdog. I need to see finesse, quality control, leadership, I need to see all of it, young man.‚Äù

Johnny: ‚ÄúGive me one more service, and you‚Äôll see all of it and more. I fully believe I‚Äôm a stronger chef than Natasha.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even have to ask. And you, Natasha, are you a stronger chef than Johnny?‚Äù

Natasha: ‚ÄúAbsolutely chef, I don‚Äôt just believe, I know for a fact that I‚Äôm a stronger chef than Johnny.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù

Natasha: ‚ÄúCause a black jacket wouldn‚Äôt nominate themselves, chef.‚Äù

*Dramatic music*

Both teams looked stunned at Natasha‚Äôs words, except Blake, who had a disheartened look. Ramsay looked equally stunned as he asked Johnny if it was true that he nominated himself. Johnny appeared emotionally defeated as, after a tense pause, he finally admitted that he did. Ramsay announced that he had heard all that he needed to hear, and his mind was made up.¬†

Ramsay: ‚ÄúMy decision is‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúJohnny, you‚Ä¶are not getting a black jacket. I‚Äôm sorry, big boy, but it‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù

Johnny took off his jacket and handed it to Ramsay, then shook his hand.¬†

Ramsay: ‚ÄúYou have been a real pleasure to watch throughout this competition, but nominating yourself at this stage tells me that you are not ready to become the next head chef of HK Foxwoods. Please keep going, and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that a good looking man can‚Äôt cook, because you‚Äôve proven otherwise.‚Äù

Johnny smiled, as he told Ramsay he would remember that, and waved goodbye to his teammates, with both Ingram and Blake shown to be fighting back their emotions as Johnny left Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.

Ramsay: ‚ÄúName?‚Äù

Johnny: ‚ÄúJohnny, chef, straight outta Detroit.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThat salmon looks almost as pretty as you do.‚Äù (both chuckle)

Johnny: ‚ÄúFeel good, look good, cook good, am I right?‚Äù

Johnny: ‚ÄúWhat can I say? I rolled the dice, and it backfired big time. I came in here knowing I was gonna be underestimated, knowing that everyone probably expected me to flop within a service or two..‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúJohnny, Johnny, come here you. All of you, come here! That strip is drier than the fucking Sahara Desert!‚Äù

*Flashback to charity night*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúYou have got to taste, taste everything! You can‚Äôt let that shit leave your kitchen!‚Äù

Johnny: ‚ÄúBut I did my best not to let that stuff get to me, because at the end of the day, I know what my skills are, and I know that no matter how many times I get knocked on my ass, I‚Äôll answer the bell.‚Äù

*Flashback to service*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúJohnny, those steaks are cooked beautifully! Keep that standard up there!‚Äù

*Flashback to post-mortem*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúJohnny, you showed me that you are a real chef. You were by far the best of the worst tonight.‚Äù

*Flashback to service*

Johnny: (being vocal and encouraging team)

Ramsay: ‚ÄúFinally, a voice in this kitchen, thank fuck for that!‚Äù

\-

Johnny: Regrets? I mean, I‚Äôll always wonder if I really did the right thing. Maybe I should have just let the chips fall where they may. Either way, I‚Äôm still grateful for the opportunity, and for the friends I made on the red team. Ingram, Blake, I‚Äôm counting on you guys. *(cut to Johnny standing outside of HK)* Pick me for your final brigade, will ya?‚Äù

*(end of elimination theme)*

After Johnny‚Äôs elimination, Ramsay told Natasha to stay where she was, then had Ingram step forward to receive his black jacket, praising him for being the most consistent chef on the red ream and being the consummate team player. Ingram said in his confessional that getting a black jacket was the culmination of a journey that began when he first said goodbye to the three special girls in his life, his wife and daughters, and now, he could finally admit to himself that it was worth it all for this moment. Next, Ramsay called on Blake, telling her that it had not been smooth sailing all the time, but she had shown tremendous heart and resolve to overcome each obstacle placed before her, and that was why he was proud to hand her a black jacket. In her confessional, Blake said that as absolutely amazing as this moment was, knowing that Johnny had gone home to make it happen made it feel bittersweet. Finally, Ramsay turned to Natasha, saying that working with her at times was like getting a root canal, but there was no denying that she had potential, if she could channel it properly, and he was willing to take that chance, because she was getting the final black jacket. Natasha said in her confessional that it was no surprise at all to get a black jacket, and she hoped everyone else was ready, because now that there were no more teams, she was just going to pick them off one by one.¬†

Ramsay addressed the black jackets as a group for the first time, saying this was the end of red vs blue, and from now on, it was just one, elite, black jacket team, which he was expecting nothing less than greatness from in the next service. With that though, he said that tonight was their night to celebrate, so he sent them back to the black jacket lounge.¬†

The chefs exited the dining room quickly, and as they got to the hallway, celebrations would officially break out, with Tami and LaMont jumping excitedly and even Stefan grinning widely. Meanwhile, an exhausted Ingram would share a smile with Blake as he said Diane would be so proud of her right now, while Blake said his family had to be going crazy when they watched this. Eventually, the chefs would get to the lounge, where they found the stock of champagne refilled, and wasted no time in toasting to the new black jacket team. The black jackets continued to indulge in the booze as the late night turned into the early morning‚Ä¶.

1h9eeb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1h9eeb5/assassin/,Assassin,"Alright, so, this request was inspired by a dream I had! I had watched some old movie about an assassin falling for their target and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what sparked it! 
Before I do get into the plot itself, I do have a few things to say! 
For one, I‚Äôm a literate writer to advanced. I do request that you have 4-5 paragraphs minimum! 
Secondly, I am a fairly busy person. I work at a dental office and work over 10+ hours, so I give about 1-2 responses on weekdays and on weekends I‚Äôm fully available. 
Third, I only wrote in third person, so I heavily prefer my Roleplay partner does as well! 

Also, yc will be your character! 
Anywho! Onto the plot!
‚Äî

Yc would be an assassin. A person who‚Äôs killed many and is the best at his job. They‚Äôre well aware that what they do isn‚Äôt always fair to some of their targets. Sure, the many yc was assigned to kill deserved it. Bad people who‚Äôd done horrible, unforgivable things. But the few who didn‚Äôt deserve it.. always made yc mildly hesitant.  Guilty, even. Just innocent people who were caught in the crossfire. But, it wasn‚Äôt exactly something yc could help. They needed the money -insert their very important/general reasoning here.- 

It was the only job that could pay good enough for yc. And yes they feel guilty at times.. but in this world being selfless only gave you trouble. Yc does what they must to survive in a cruel world. Yc was out doing regular errands when their boss had called them over for a new mission. And albeit not exactly in the mood to kill.. yc knew better than to object. So, yc made their way immediately to headquarters. 

Once yc had arrived at the main building and entered his boss‚Äô office- a file was tossed onto the table almost immediately. ‚ÄúYour newest assignment.‚Äù Spoke a smooth, monotone voice. ‚ÄúHer name is Vienna Fransoin. 24. Her father owns and runs a large tech wear company.‚Äù The older brunette woman sat back in her office chair seat- hand carefully wiping a small area on her massive black desk. ‚ÄúApparently her father borrowed from some people and never paid back. They know they can‚Äôt kill him otherwise they won‚Äôt get their money back. So..‚Äù 

The brunette‚Äôs hazel colored eyes shifted onto yc- her posture straight and perfect as ever, heel clicking against the cold marble floor rhythmically. ‚ÄúThey want a hit on the girl. Vienna‚Äôs the eldest daughter with one sister. Though unfortunately that girl‚Äôs across the sea right about now. Anywho, your clients don‚Äôt want Vienna dead now. They want you to wait until her father‚Äôs grand speech a month from now.. which you‚Äôll kill her then. In the meantime you‚Äôll be pretending to be the girl‚Äôs bodyguard. Her father recently hired someone to keep her safe due to some threats directed at him. You‚Äôll stay by her side and kill her when the time is right. Understood?‚Äù 

With a simple nod, yc grabbed the file and flipped it open. There sat an image of a young woman with gentle faded grey-green eyes, soft blonde hair and a fair complexion. The woman, Vienna, had a slightly round face, and gentle round eyes- overall a rather peaceful looking woman. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs partially blind. Everything‚Äôs all fuzzy and blurry- can barely make out silhouettes sometimes. No criminal record, nothing in her background that sticks out.. just a boring girl. She works at a flower shop and lives alone, no lover. She‚Äôs expecting to meet you at a coffee shop called ‚ÄòDaisy‚Äôs delectables‚Äô on Monday. You‚Äôll live with her, a room has already been prepared and everything. This is a pretty big job, Yc. They‚Äôll pay you a good amount, too. Don‚Äôt mess this up.‚Äù 

Yc stared down at the file in hand, reading each and every line carefully. Friends, family, addresses, etcetera the poor girl hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. But that wasn‚Äôt any of yc‚Äôs business. Do the mission, get the money. That‚Äôs all that mattered to yc. It was plain and simple. 

But what if it wasn‚Äôt? What if yc ends up falling for Vienna? What if they find themselves unable to kill her? Now yc‚Äôs torn between killing the person they‚Äôve fallen for or getting their money to help with whatever issue they are dealing with.

I have known this girl since I was in third grade, she was my first and for the longest time my only friend in school. We were both severely bullied and outcasted from our peers, so we found comfort in one another. 

She became not only my best friend, but she was practically a sister to me. Her family honestly took me in and helped raise me when my father couldn‚Äôt. We would always hang out in school, I would go to her house after school nearly every day and I would stay there until my father could come get me. 

Nearly every weekend I was spending the night and having sleep overs with her. We laughed, cried, fought sometimes but made up, and we were absolute best friends. We planned a future where we would get married on the same day, grow up next to one another and our kids would be best friends too. 

But life had another plan. Nearly 5 years of friendship, we were forced apart thanks to my father and his wife making me leave schools and refusing to let me speak to any old friends I had. We lost contact for about 4 years, until I left to live with my mom and I was finally able to reach out again on Facebook. 

My mom drove me herself to go see my old best friend, and although we did cry and catch up, it sadly was never the same thanks to those years being forced apart. We kept in touch for a bit until we both agreed it was better to remain acquaintances rather than friends. I knew it broke her heart like it did mine, and it still hurts.. 

Yesterday, 12/6/2024, her mother called me on messenger to tell me she died. From cancer. And now my whole world is thrown through a loop. 

I have never lost someone before.. and I feel so wrong. We weren‚Äôt close as we once were, but I‚Äôm grieving so hard. I feel like I‚Äôm not grieving right or correctly if that makes sense.. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a right to grieve like her family does. I feel like I‚Äôm inconveniencing everyone else around me because I‚Äôm just useless right now. 

I barely held it together at work today and almost cried in front of customers. I just drank multiple coffees to get over it. I feel so.. lost. I see the happy Christmas lights and cheer, it was our favorite holiday, but now it feels.. empty. Lifeless. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. My fianc√© is doing his best to help, but I feel like I‚Äôm just messing it up. He knows what grief feels like, he‚Äôs sadly lost his mother and his great grandfather. But I feel like mine doesn‚Äôt compare to his, and that I just don‚Äôt need to.. 

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sorry for inconveniencing anybody who reads this too. I‚Äôm just sorry.

But what are ways to express thanks to people you don't know that well who do nice things for you that aren't like a card + gift (like cash, gifts card, purchased item etc).  

There have been other things in life, and weve probably needed to work on it before now, but the most recent example.  I posted on next door asking for  rental company recommendations for affordable chairs to rent for my baby shower (because I didn't need $3 per chair white fancy chairs).  Someone sent me a private message that they had extra chairs we could just use, no money,  as long as we return them (so they went out on a limb for a stranger to let us walk away $100s worth of chairs if these were all purchased, rental price has i gone through a company like $60).   My husband wants to get a card and like a $50 gift card.  But I'm like, she offered to save us from spending money on chairs....so to turn around and give her money?...but I see his point as ""just a card"" doesn't feel sufficient.  We've never met this person other than to get chairs.  

Suggestions?  I'd like to get away from always feeling like I'm not doing enough in situations like this but I also don't know how to express the gratitude in a way that doesn't feel like ....cool thanks bye, particularly in this area of people I don't know well...and will likely never see again.   I mean other smaller situations might be like people buying your coffee for you at Starbucks etc.  I immediately want to repay it.  ",2,1733645499.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False
1h9e74x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h9e74x/aita_for_not_getting_my_coworkers_coffee/,AITA for not getting my coworker‚Äôs coffee?,"I started this job a month after him, and we became good acquaintances. Over the next six months, I thought we were becoming friends‚Äîhanging out, having lunch, walking to our cars together, and interacting on social media. But I noticed he only texted during work hours and never initiated contact outside work, so I dialed back and kept it professional.

When I started full-time school with in-person classes, they stopped inviting me to hang out as much. At first, it hurt, but I realized I was busy and couldn‚Äôt expect them to always include me. I figured this was just a work friendship and let it go. After that, they didn‚Äôt really reach out, and then he got a promotion, moved departments, and became busier, so we barely talk now‚Äîjust brief, surface-level interactions. I understand this happens, but it‚Äôs important for context.

The issue:
When I first started, he had a Friday coffee tradition with another coworker. He invited me, and the three of us started going weekly. This continued for months until we drifted apart. Around then, he skipped coffee because he was sick, then too busy. We picked it up for him a couple of times, and he paid us back, so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. But after his promotion, he stopped coming altogether, and it felt weird to keep asking if he wanted coffee since we weren‚Äôt close anymore.

One week, after several weeks of him saying no, I assumed he didn‚Äôt want any and didn‚Äôt ask. He texted later, upset we didn‚Äôt check with him. I felt bad at first, but then I thought about how he‚Äôd stopped inviting me to things. How was it fair for him to feel slighted when he had done the same? If roles were reversed, I‚Äôd never expect someone to get my coffee‚ÄîI‚Äôd text them my order ahead of time, ask if it was okay, and pay upfront. But he didn‚Äôt do any of that. We‚Äôd have to ask, wait for his response (sometimes delayed), buy it, and then wait for the money. This last time, he didn‚Äôt even pay me back.

It‚Äôs not about the money‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling like DoorDash. I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it if it meant connection or good conversation, but lately, he just says ‚Äúthanks,‚Äù takes the coffee, and gets back to work. I get that he‚Äôs busy, but if you‚Äôre too busy to connect, why expect others to go out of their way for you?

Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic, but it feels like I‚Äôm being used. More than that, I‚Äôm sad I lost a potential friend. These work relationships mean a lot to me, especially as a neurodivergent person, since they‚Äôre often my main source of connection during the day. I don‚Äôt want things to be awkward, but I also don‚Äôt want to feel like a personal delivery service. He can get defensive when confronted, so I worry this will blow up.
