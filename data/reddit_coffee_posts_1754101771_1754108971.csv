Day 1. Sunday.

I had a flight booked home for July 27. It was back to Thunder Bay via Flair, and I lost my Id’s while at a concert. I missed this flight because of it. I had about 160$, which the Ontario Northland bus costs $220, and was sold out Monday the 28th. 

Day 2 Monday. I panicked and freaked out, I don’t have family (CAS child) and my friends aren’t any better. I came here alone. I spent the night in Pearson. I discovered I could hop on at Bloor or Weston and make it down there. I also discovered I can get free food via re-downloading Mcdoanlds & 7/11.

Day 3/4:5 - I have been wandering, but with the lack of sleep I have been struggling. I’m not blacking out, it’s just hard to concentrate. I bought a new pack of socks at Dollarama, but my feet are like tearing apart. Almost papercuts ? 

I have useless friends, no family - I don’t know what else to do other then simply ask. I emailed OW but they said it would be atleast next week. Im about $70 currently short of the Ontario Northland Ticket Home.

If 70 different people could send me $1 I could make it home tomorrow - leaving Yorkdale Bus Terminal @9:10am. 

I don’t know what else to do. No this isn’t a scam, I’m literally sitting on the floor of Pearson charging my phone worn out mentally and physically.

It’s less then a 1/3 of your ttc fare 

I tried to do the “buy me a cup of coffee” thing but it won’t work.

CHAPTER 1 — Final Touches

The light hummed gently overhead. A warm, amber bulb—hand-blown glass, just slightly crooked at the neck. Elliot twisted it a quarter turn until the shadows across the carpet fell exactly where he wanted them. It wasn’t much, but it made the whole room feel like it had purpose again.

He stepped back, quiet. Still.
The woman sat upright in the tufted chair near the fireplace. Her skin was pale, powdered, with just a hint of rouge at the cheekbones. Hands folded in her lap. Head tilted softly to one side, like she was listening to a conversation that had ended an hour ago.

She looked beautiful. Still.
Not in a romantic way—not even in a human way.
More like how you look at an old photograph behind glass.

Elliot adjusted her collar one last time. Then he picked up the linen cloth and slowly wiped his fingerprints from the armrest.

“Good,” he said to himself, in a quiet, soft tone. “You belong here.”

He glanced around the room. It had taken four nights.
Fresh wallpaper. Dust scrubbed from every corner. Wood trim stained and sealed. He’d found the chair at an estate sale three towns over and carried it here in pieces. Every item in the room was period-accurate to 1912.

Even the record player in the corner—a Victrola he restored himself—creaked to life, crackling out soft strings and static.

A card rested on the nearby table, handwritten in sepia ink:

Eleanor Whitmore
Preserved: July 11, 2025
“You are safe from time now.”



Elliot blinked slowly, letting the moment sink in.
He didn’t smile, not really. But something eased in his shoulders. This was the good part.

He stepped to the wall and flipped the breaker, cutting the lights. The golden glow vanished. Only the sliver of moonlight through a cracked window remained.

He left through the rear service door, closing it gently behind him. Three locks slid into place. He didn’t look back.

Outside, the air was hot and still. His car—a silver, rust-flecked Toyota pickup—sat quietly beneath a collapsed sign that once read SILVER PINES RETIREMENT HOME.

He slid into the driver’s seat, hands clean, breath steady.

On the passenger seat: an old manila folder. One name circled in red ink.
A new location.

Elliot turned the key.
Another night, another room. Another life paused forever.


CHAPTER 2: THE URGE

Elliot slept in his dark room, on his bed with blue sheets, blue pillows and blue blankets. He likes that color. It was his dad's favorite. His dad is the reason he's like this. His dad loved the color blue, no one knew why. It made Elliot calmer, because he has mixed emotions with his dad- hatred, love, everything.

Elliot had a nightmare- which he never does. The nasty, wall stained trailer that always smelt like Beer and Whiskey. It was about his dad. His dad, hitting and abusing his mom. Destroying her perfect face. Elliot never liked his father, but that made Elliot even more angry. He screamed out loudly, since he lives alone.

Elliot got out of bed early due to the nightmare. He made a nice, warm cup of coffee. Held it sitting in his dark dining room, while in his gray sweatshirt, and his white pajamas with blue stripes.

He needed another kill- already. So he searched. He had to begin with the basics- social media. Elliot doesn't like social media much, but it helps. He needs to find another Blonde, older woman, who's skinny, and has brown eyes- just like his mom.

He found a victim- Laura Morgan. He noticed that she posted a photo, or a selfie, in front of her house. Big mistake, making it easy for him to find her address. He drove past, only looking. She has two young boys- like Elliot- and an angry-looking husband. He noticed the husband with the brown stained white tank top wearing jeans and brown boots pushing Laura around. ""She's... perfect,"" Elliot whispered to himself. 


CHAPTER 3: EMPTY
Laura works at a restaurant. Not as a server or anything, but as a janitor. As Laura dropped off her kids to the babysitter, since she doesn't trust her husband, she went to work. Elliot sat and waited. He used his phone to watch his favorite movie- Creep. At 6:00 P.M. is when Laura left work. Before she left the building, he broke into her car, by lock picking the door, since it was an older, worse car, and waited in the backseat, the sun's light not being able to reflect in the car, since Laura parked behind the building.

Laura got into her car, and just started yelling out ""Fuck"" while slamming her hands on the wheel. Elliot put his syringe full of m.99 into her neck, the yelling stopped in an instant- peace and quiet.

He brought Laura to an old 1920's house. The song ""Venus"" by Frankie Avalon plays quietly in the background. ""Hey, Venus. Oh Venus"" the song went. Laura woke up, arms tied to the chair. ""Hey! What the hell is this!?"" she screamed. ""Hello there, mom"" Elliot said.

The confused look on Laura's face, she's younger than Elliot, which confused her even more. ""I'm not your mother"" she proclaimed.

Elliot choked her, screaming ""Yes, you are,"" the song being unable to be heard anymore. He threw the chair to the floor, as Laura yelled. Elliot choked her. He could tell she died quickly, but he kept choking.

He got his clay, and sculpted her face with it for his trophy. After sculpting, he chops the body up into nine pieces. Dumbs her at construction sites, lakes, and different graves. He hides the sculpts in his shed's AC unit. He noticed her on the news after everything. The husband was crying with her kids- clearly fake. Elliot knows a monster when he sees one.

CHAPTER 4: MY FATHER

Elliot couldn't sleep. Not while Laura's husband was out there. He's never wanted to kill the husband of his victims, but there's always a first time for everything. ""Fuck,"" Elliot screamed out.

Elliot needed a distraction from everything, so he went to his mom's favorite restaurant- Sunshine Eats. The way his mom poured the maple syrup into her pancakes. The way she bit her bacon. Missed her a lot. 

Elliot ordered his mom's favorite- the big smacker. Two pancakes, three bacon strips, and two eggs. Before the finished preparing his food, he just left. No words. Nothing. At all.

He remembers his dad every time they came back from going out. Hitting his mom, with a belt, baseball bat, anything he could find. Younger Elliot got fed up with it. He grabbed a dirty knife from the sink when his dad went to bed, and he stabbed him. Write into his neck. His mom sprung up, screaming loudly. She called the cops, saying ""Help, my son just stabbed my husband while we were sleeping,"" Elliot just stood there as his dead gargled and bled out. His mom in the room's closet while crying her eyes out. Elliot felt... great.

CHAPTER 5: HER HUSBAND

Elliot couldn't live with Laura's husband being out and about. He had to act. And soon. Even though Elliot has his code, he needs to kill the husband. He went to Laura's house. He heard the husband yelling from outside, telling the kids to clean before he beats them. He was furious from that alone. He was able to go home... for now.

Two nights later, Elliot found himself awake at Five in the morning. He went to Laura's house to handle the husband, since he couldn't wait any longer.

""Fuck"" Elliot said to himself. He kicked down the front door, instantly ran to the husband. He grabbed his neck with one hand, threw him on the counter, stabbed his hand into the counter to hold him in place. He filled the sink up with water, and drowned the husband. He threw him to the ground, then realized he messed up.


CHAPTER 5: MY ROYAL FUCK UP

Elliot sped home, realizing that he definitely just left a lot of DNA there. He had to pack, and leave. ""What the fuck have I just done?"" Elliot screamed out in his car. 

The first responders got to the scene, and saw the man's kids, hugging his lifeless corpse. They had to pull them off the dead man. Then the detectives arrived, along with forensics. Detective Batista, and Detective Quinn. Forensics found a lot of Elliot's DNA, especially hair. 

Elliot had his bags packed and ready to go. He got in his car, and drove off. No plan, just driving. He drove until he got to Florida. A Nine-hour drive due to his acting on impulse. He got a hotel, and instantly hopped in the shower. once he got out, he stared at himself in the mirror. He sat there for an hour- just staring at himself. 

Elliot went to bed, all silent. Elliot woke up at 6:37 A.M and instantly went for breakfast. The hotel had a terrible breakfast. It was just cereal, muffins, coffee and yogurt. ""What the fuck kind of hotel doesn't have a waffle maker!?"" Elliot said in his mind.

Dale, my Dale‘s arm draped casually around Rachel. She was laughing at something he said, her head tilted back, her hair cascading over her shoulders. Dale was smiling too, that easy, charming smile I had fallen in love with.

He pecked her forehead，''See you in your bed tonight.''

I was completely frozen. Tears welled up in my eyes, make a sobbing sound

And they both snapped their heads in my direction.

Dale quickly disentangled himself from her, taking a step towards me. "" Tamara, it's no-,""

I glared at him. ""Really? Because it looks like you two are awfully cozy. And after all the promises, all the things you said about wanting to be a family?""



————————

Just because it’s dark doesn’t mean I can’t see him across the street.

I’d recognize him anywhere. Tall, broad-chested and hunched. Always wearing shorts and walking boots, no matter what the weather.

The incessant rain has finally calmed to a chilly drizzle. The kind that makes you want to pull your curtains across the moment it becomes dark, and get cosy in front of the fire. But right now, I don’t think there’s anywhere I could get cosy. I shiver.

He’s standing in his usual spot. In the shadow of the trees straight opposite my house. Is he trying to conceal himself or does he want me to know he’s watching?

I fight the urge to grab my phone, to call my husband and shriek, he’s back – please hurry home. I’d love for Dale to be at least a little concerned, especially now – for him to be compelled to rush back here, needing to protect me and our unborn child. But I know what he’d say with his usual bored expression… It’s all in your imagination, Tamara. The poor man’s probably just waiting for someone.

Yeah, me. Perhaps Dale will sit up and take notice when my body ends up in a shallow grave. The man stands there every night and it’s always at the same time. He’s never around when I initially arrive home. I get back from the salon at around half past six and Dale’s normally an hour and a half later, after he’s been to his precious gym. The man outside clearly knows our routine.

I glance at my little Fiat which I couldn’t have parked any closer to the house. Each night before I pull in, I do a visual sweep of my garden. And then again before I get out of the car to make sure he isn’t lying in wait to grab me as I dash to my porch. But it’s always the same – he doesn’t appear until I’m safely through the door.

I startle as my phone rings, hoping it’s Dale. Perhaps he’s somehow sensed my distress from his treadmill.

‘Hi, Ali. You OK?’ I can’t keep the disgruntlement from my tone that it isn’t my husband. I should have known better than to hope. He never calls me spontaneously anymore. The days when he used to call just to hear my voice feel like they happened in another lifetime.

‘I could ask you the same question, sis.’ She chuckles. ‘You sound like you’ve just returned from a funeral.’ Despite my disappointment, it’s always a comfort to hear the familiarity of her voice. But I’m surprised that she’s making any sort of joke about funerals – neither of us attended our father’s twelve years ago and three years ago, I attended our mother’s alone. The subject of our parents or any sort of death talk is usually off-limits between us. However, I’ve got other things to worry about right now.

‘The bloody man’s back. He’s been there every night since the new year.’ The heavy curtain falls back into position as I let it drop. I can’t keep looking out into the street. Plus, who knows, my staring back at him might be giving him some sort of encouragement.

‘I thought you were going to report him to the police.’ She sounds as beleaguered as Dale usually does. But just because neither of them has seen him doesn’t mean it’s all in my imagination.

‘I did report him, actually. Last night.’

‘When? You never mentioned it when we spoke.’

‘It was later. Anyway, there was nothing much to mention – it was a complete waste of time.’ I sigh at the memory as I sink into the armchair. ‘He’d vanished by the time they got here.’

‘Didn’t they come straightaway?’

‘No, it took them three hours – that’s how important they thought it was. By then, Dale was moaning he was tired and wanted to go to bed.’

‘Was he with you when they arrived?’

‘Yeah – but he said while we were waiting that they’d probably do me for wasting police time. He reckons it’s my hormones.’

Ali stays quiet, suggesting she probably agrees. What’s got to happen for the two of them to take me seriously?

‘They did look at me as though I might be unhinged.’ I wince at the memory.

‘So what did they say?’

‘Well, I answered their questions. What has he done? What has he said? How do you know it’s you he’s watching? Could he just be waiting for a lift?’

‘You mean, pretty much like I’ve been saying? Especially since you say he’s out there at the same time each night.’ She might be doing her best to disguise it, but Ali’s voice is edged with irritation and something within me sags. If my sister isn’t taking me seriously, what chance do I have of making anyone else listen?

‘They told me they can’t do anything against a man who’s just standing there and instead, gave me a load of waffle about personal and house security. Then Dale made some barbed comment in front of them about getting a life and finding something better to do when I get home than staring through the window.’

A car, which sounds like Dale’s, pulls up outside, so I spring back up from the chair. I’ve been like this a lot lately, and over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been getting worse. I can’t sit still for more than a minute. And it’s not just because of the man outside. My husband’s budding friendship with one of our neighbours is also causing me concern.

‘The police are kind of right, you know.’ My sister’s using the appeasing tone she always seems to reserve for me. ‘If it’s the same man out there every night, he could be there for any number of reasons.’

‘I’d just like to be more important than Dale’s nightly visits to the bloody gym once in a while. He knows the upset this is causing for me.’

‘I’m sure if you asked him, he’d have a night or two at home.’

‘I’ve already tried.’ I pace the rug, resisting the urge to return to my familiar spot at the window. ‘There’s nothing more important than his⁠—.’

There’s a huge shriek and a bang in Ali’s background. ‘Sorry, sis. Gotta go. It sounds like my two monsters might be killing each other. I’ll call you back in a few minutes.’

Feeling lonelier than ever, I rest my phone on the coffee table, then unable to help myself, I return to the window and peel back the curtain, my gaze immediately darting to the spot where the man usually stands. I let a long breath out. He’s gone.

The car I heard was Dale but for some reason, he hasn’t pulled his car up behind mine on the drive. Instead, he’s parked at the edge of the road outside our house.

His headlights fade as he reaches for his work bag from the passenger seat. I don’t want him to see me looking out so I let the curtain drop. His car door bangs and my heart quickens as I wait for the sound of his footsteps to beat their path up the drive to our door.

But the night remains silent.

I peer around the edges of my curtain, hoping he won’t spot me but already knowing what’s likely to be causing his delay.

Yes, just as I suspected, Dale’s talking to that woman across the road. He clearly enjoys her company far more than mine. She steps closer to him, touching his arm, looking to be hanging onto his every word. Now they’re laughing together – he certainly never seems to laugh with me anymore. I know I’ve been miserable since becoming pregnant, not only with the sickness that is thankfully subsiding, but also with the fear that something’s going to go wrong. This really isn’t the time for him to withdraw – not when I need him the most.

The woman throws her head back, obviously loving every moment of their conversation. I can’t believe she’s the first person he wants to speak to upon arriving home after a long day away, instead of coming inside to start his evening with me. I bet he wishes he was going through her front door instead of returning to our side of the street.

And that’s definitely what she wishes.

Until the day I die, I’ll marvel at your perfect face and the way you scrunch your face up when you’re thinking.

I’ll never take you for granted.

The neighbour’s house is lit up like a light show and as always, she hasn’t closed her blinds. She usually doesn’t until much later in the evening – it’s as if she wants everyone to see inside her home, definitely an exhibitionist.

But I’m one to talk – I often nosy into her house from the vantage point of my darkened upstairs window. Naturally, her home is everything mine isn’t. Hers is neutral, minimalist and feminine. In contrast, and just like our childhood home, mine’s a mish-mash of colour and clutter. I’m like my mother was in that respect and no amount of reorganising and decluttering will ever alter that. Dale used to say he liked my style of living and that a house should look ‘lived in.’ However, these days, he moans like crazy about the lack of order in our surroundings. He’ll have even more to complain about when the baby’s born.

What are they talking about? She’s all over him, yet, she barely gives me the time of day whenever I say hello. I’m lucky to get a curt nod as I’m coming and going from the house.

I jump as my phone bursts back into life and snatch it up from the table. I’m so on edge. I rest a protective hand over my still-flat belly. All this stress can’t be any good for the baby.

‘It’s me again. I’ve managed to avert World War Three between the terrors.’ My sister laughs. ‘Anyway, the reason I was ringing in the first place was to check you’re still OK to babysit these little darlings on Saturday. You haven’t forgotten, have you?’

‘Of course not.’ Something brightens inside me. I adore my nephews and love my auntie time. I’ve already got our movie evening and treats planned. The only spanner in the works is that Dale and I will be apart overnight. I’ve suggested so many times that we babysit together but he never wants to.

‘It’s just I know you’ve got a lot on your mind, and⁠—’

‘It’s fine, honestly – you can ask whenever you need to. You know how much I love being around them.’

‘Ah good.’ I can hear the relief in her voice. ‘They can’t wait. You’d think they hadn’t seen you for a month, not just a week.’

‘Anyway…’ Yet again, I peer around the edge of the curtain. ‘He’s gone.’

‘Who’s gone?’

‘The man.’

‘Oh, that man. See, what did I tell you – his lift has probably arrived. But you need to stop looking out of your window all the time, Tamara. You’ll drive yourself bananas.’

‘It’s not just out of this window. He was hanging around near the salon last week and he was even standing two places behind me in the checkout queue at the weekend.’ I’m still unnerved by the memory. I’ve never run to my car so fast with a shopping trolley.

‘For goodness sake, he’s allowed to do his shopping. It’ll just be a coincidence that you’ve seen him near the salon. Otley’s not exactly a vast place in which to live.’

‘It’s the way he looks at me – I’ve got a really bad feeling.’

‘You’ve always had an overactive imagination,’ she chuckles. ‘In fact, you’re far worse now than when we were kids.’

First funerals, now childhood. Like the topic of our parents, the subject of our childhood usually stays dead and buried. However, I have to admit that impending motherhood is drawing bad memories and long-pushed-down feelings of guilt back to the surface. And I don’t have the same energy as I had pre-pregnancy to keep squashing them down. But somehow, I must keep my focus on the present.

1mfhei5,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mfhei5/buzz_buzz_the_sound_of_my_husbands_phone/,Buzz. Buzz. The sound of my husband's phone vibrating on the nightstand jolted me awake. Who texts at 2am?,"My hand moved before my mind caught up. I swiped the screen and unlocked it easily.

0914. Grayson had never been good with passwords.

A woman's name suddenly popped up, my stomach dropped.

Harley: ""Found your hoodie at mine. Packed it for the trip—figured you'd want it for the cold nights.""

I stared at the message, my heart thudding loudly in my ears.

Someone from work, I told myself. A friend. A cousin he never told me about.

But just then, another message came in:

""Can't wait to have you all to myself this weekend. No distractions.""

My body jerked violently as if someone had shot me.

————————

As the elevator rose, I tried to ignore the nervous bubbles in my stomach. While Grayson had never told me not to visit him here, he always seemed to shake me off when I suggested it—offering instead to meet down the road or sometimes even at my library. Now, as the doors opened to the quiet floor of Blackspire Capital, my brain couldn't help but wonder why that was.

There was no one at the small desk in front of the elevators, and I wondered briefly if I should wait for someone to direct me to Grayson before I heard his smooth voice down the hallway.

""So, what's the plan for this weekend?"" His voice was casual, echoing down the hallway. It was easy to follow the sound to the small conference room. The blinds were closed to the inside, but the door was open ever so slightly.

A chatter filled the space from his question, clearly in a meeting or something. I decided to wait for Grayson outside the door—excited beyond belief to show him the book and, more important, the inscription I added to the book that I never told him about.

As I waited, I opened the book to the note.

To the one who never needed a sword to be dangerous. You just had to look at me.

My eyes flashed across the words, my vulnerability written into the page so open for anyone to read. But I believed in him. Believed in Grayson's love for me so completely that when I heard my name spoken in the meeting room, I only half-listened.

""We have that company retreat this weekend."" It was Damon' roguish voice. ""What excuse have you given Lillie for her not to come?""

Excuse? Company retreat?

My brain stopped computing all words but those. Why would Grayson need an excuse to not invite me?

I had barely a moment to think before Grayson's voice replied. The voice that once brought me warmth and happiness was devoid of all emotions.

""I don't need an excuse not to invite."" For a second, my heart soared—Grayson, even emotionless like he was, would always stand up for me... then he continued: ""The second I mention camping, she would come up with her own.""

My heart didn't just shatter—it felt crushed under the weight of their laughter. They talked about me like I was a punchline. And Grayson? He sat in the silence, letting them rip me out of the story we built.

Then I heard her poisonous voice. Harley's voice was smooth like blood dripping from my heart as she finally twisted the knife she had stabbed into my heart the first time we spoke.

""Guess it's just me and you again, Grayson. Hope you remembered how I like my coffee in the mornings.""

The laugh that followed broke something in me.

I didn't cry. I didn't gasp. I didn't even move.

I just stood there, holding a book he promised to be proud of—wondering how long he'd been rewriting our story without telling me I was no longer in it.



I didn't storm in. I didn't demand answers. I didn't do anything.

Instead, I turned. Walked. One foot in front of the other.

The book—our book—pressed tight to my chest like it could hold me together.

I made it to the elevator without anyone noticing me. I pressed the button. I didn't breathe.

Maybe if I stayed quiet enough, the heartbreak wouldn't echo.

I honestly don't know how I made it back to my house in one piece, because while I looked whole on the outside, it felt like someone had shattered my heart and mind completely.

Grayson. Just a few hours ago, he'd gotten up early from our bed. Smooched me on the forehead as I rolled into the spot he'd just vacated. His sleepy chuckle still echoed in my mind, warm and intimate.

I still wanted to believe that was real. That beneath the tired laugh and morning warmth, there was a man who loved me—truly loved me. But now, even that memory felt like a fragile dream slipping through my fingers.

""Have a good day, Little One.""

His voice was rough with sleep but full of devotion. Or so I thought. Just hours later, he let his friends and coworkers talk about me like I was nothing. He didn't stop them. Didn't defend me.

The things I overheard circled around my empty living room, mocking me. Harley's voice especially—always dipped in condescension, like I was a kid playing grown-up. I used to laugh it off, thinking it was just her way. But now I remembered the way she said Grayson's name. Like she already had it tucked inside her mouth.

A small part of me still wanted to believe there was more to it, some explanation I hadn't heard yet. But that hope felt fragile—like glass waiting to shatter.

I'd believed our love was real. Solid. But it was just a story. A pretty illusion that crumbled the second I heard their laughter behind that meeting room door.

As I sat there, picking through every moment of our relationship, trying to pinpoint when I became a joke to him, the darkness in my head leaked into the room around me.

Night fell quickly when you weren't paying attention. Thursdays were usually my half days. Grayson's longest. He often didn't come home until late. But as I sat wondering if that was even true—or just another excuse—headlights passed the window.

He was home.

The familiar sound of his car used to soothe something deep inside me. Now, it curdled my blood.

As he lumbered up the porch, something inside me snapped.

I wish that when the door opened I was emotionless, like those girls in movies who sit still and make men crumble under their silence. But no—this wasn't a movie, and my heartbreak didn't look good in soft lighting. Instead, I got angry, and something miraculous happened. A pettiness took over.

I wanted him to hurt the way I had, standing outside that meeting room.

So, as the door opened, my body moved before my brain did. I laid down, closed my eyes, and waited.

""Little One.""

His voice—honeyed and soft—filled the quiet house. I curled in on myself, pretending to be asleep. Pretending I hadn't heard everything. Pretending he hadn't broken me.

He took off his shoes, dropped his bag, then flicked on the light. Red bled through my eyelids, too bright and invasive. My skin prickled with the heat of him, my heart pounding like it was trying to crawl out of my chest. Even my breath sounded fake to me—too even, too careful.

He saw me.

""Lillie?""

There was worry in his voice. Or what I used to think was worry. Now I questioned everything.

""What's wrong, honey?""

He rushed over, his hand warm against the goosebumps on my arm. I clenched my jaw. Every nerve screamed to flinch, to recoil, but I lay frozen—like prey playing dead.

When I opened my eyes, the overhead light cast his face in shadow. But I could still see him—every detail memorized over the last two years. This man was a part of me. But how much of me did he truly carry in return?

He knelt in front of me. His face came into focus.

Part of me wanted to hate him, to push him away and never look back. But another part still searched those eyes—looking for a trace of the man I fell in love with, a sign that maybe, just maybe, he wasn't completely lost to me.

Worry carved into his features. Those honey-gold eyes, circled by soft brown, searched mine like they were desperate to find something they'd lost. I used to believe those eyes never lied. But now? I didn't trust them. Not the warmth in them. Not the concern. Maybe I'd only ever seen what I wanted to. Maybe I'd mistaken silence for softness, distance for depth.

""Are you okay?"" he asked, eyes tracking every movement.

I held back the disgust, the desire to pull away.

""I think I'm coming down with something,"" I said, my voice barely mine. It sounded sick, sure—but to me, it sounded broken.

""What can I get you, Little One?"" He looked over my body, like he expected to see bruises. But a broken heart doesn't bruise the skin.

""Let's get you to bed. I'll make something light for dinner.""

I wanted to say no. To tell him to go to the guest room. But I remembered how he'd taken care of me the last time I was sick. How he'd hovered with quiet worry that had once made me feel cherished.

So I let him guide me. His hands too warm on my elbows.

The excuse of not wanting to get him sick as well on the tip of my tongue. As if already hearing my concerns he pulled me through the door.

""If you get me sick,"" he said with a chuckle, ""then it's your turn to take care of me. We get through this together. Like always.""

His words turned to ash in my mouth.

""What about your company retreat?""

The words slipped out before I could stop them.

He paused. Just for a second. Enough to see it—something flickering behind his eyes. Was it fear? Guilt?

Then he smiled. That blinding, too-perfect grin.

I used to think I knew every version of that smile. The tired one he gave me after long days. The lazy one after morning smooches. The bright one when I said something that made him proud. But this smile? I didn't recognize it.

And that scared me more than anything.

Because if I didn't know this smile—if I didn't know this man—then who had I been loving all this time?

""I'm co-owner. If I get sick and can't go then that's just the way it is. If you're too sick tomorrow I'll happily cancel the whole thing and be here with you.""

My stomach turned. He was good. Too good.

I turned from him, pulling the blanket tighter.

He wouldn't cancel even if I died tonight. He would be spending the weekend with Harley; he wouldn't let his little girlfriend ruin his plans no matter what.

He stood behind me for a beat, then changed out of his work clothes. Slipped into something more comfortable.

""What do you want to eat?"" he asked, sitting beside me and taking my hands.

He could probably feel how cold they were, probably thought it was from a fever. I didn't have the heart to tell him it was just the chill of being lied to by someone you thought would never hurt you. Classic case of love-induced hypothermia.

""I don't want anything. Just order for yourself.""

He shook his head.

""You need something. Even something small.""

I didn't fight. Let him choose. Anything to get him out of the room.

He smooched my head before heading downstairs.

As I lay there, counting the seconds until I could fake sleep, I heard it.

A buzz.

His phone.

It was on his bedside table. My hand moved before my mind caught up.

I'd never checked his phone before. I never needed to. Never even thought about it.

The screen lit up.

A black and white photo of a mountaintop. One we'd climbed together. I used to think it was a quiet symbol of our love. Now, I wasn't sure.

A message covered the sun in the photo.

Harls.

No heart emoji. No nickname that screamed intimacy. But still.

I opened it before I could stop myself. Told myself it was for closure. Truth. Proof that he really broke me.

0914

I knew his passcode. Too many times have I had to send back messages while he drove or changed the music. It wasn't something he hid and I thought that meant he had nothing to hide behind the passcode. How wrong I was.

Found your hoodie at mine. Packed it for the trip—figured you'd want it for the cold nights

I stared at the message, my heart thudding loudly in my ears. Then, three dots appeared beneath it—she was still typing.



Betrayal doesn't shatter you in the moment. It waits—quiet and still—then breaks you in the silence after.

That moment when the pain had already hit, but your body hadn't caught up yet.

When your brain played tricks—convincing you it wasn't that bad, that you misunderstood, that maybe, somehow, love could survive this.

But then the truth slithered in.

Quiet. Patient.

And suddenly, everything started to unravel.

Later that night, as Grayson snored softly beside me, my brain ran a mile a minute.

I was breaking. And he was sleeping.

My mind brought in Harley's messages.

The one that hinted he'd left sweaters at her house. That he knew her coffee order.

And worse—the message that came through his phone minutes before he walked upstairs with the soup:

Can't wait to have you all to myself this weekend. No distractions

Was that what I was to Grayson?

A distraction keeping him from the people who mattered?

My body stung at the thought.

Was I just Grayson's dirty little secret? Something he hid from the parts of his life that truly mattered?

A man stood beside me with a black leather jacket and tattoos.

My throat was tight, and I wanted to run away, but he grabbed me tightly.

""Don't be afraid."" The low voice was a little hoarse, but unexpectedly gentle. He took off his leather jacket and draped it over my shivering shoulders. ""I'm Wolf, the enforcer of the Sons of Silence MC. You're safe now.""

IVY'S POV

Barely able to move after what they did to me, I push myself to get moving before they return. I want to curl up and die or cry but it won't help. I need to move faster. I grab the bag of clothes and papers I have had packed and hidden. I have to crawl down the stairs, it's just to painful to walk down them. I can feel their seeds and my blood running down my legs when I stand up to walk again. I pull on my hoodie and it's hood up as the uber pulls up. I run the best I can while looking out for them to return. I give the driver Leena's address and sit back. I can feel the driver staring. I know he noticed my injuries, but thankfully he says nothing.

20 minutes later we pull up to her address. I pay and painfully walk my way to her. She meets me halfway and helps me inside. I had already called her and told her what happened. ""Honey, I am so sorry this happened. I stole a couple of violation kits from work. I am going to do them incase we ever need them. Then I will help you bath and patch you up where I can. I am then going to take you to a friend."" She says. I whine scared to leave and go somewhere else. ""You know he will look for you here."" Leena reminds me. She is right, so I nod. ""Okay his name is Medic. He is part of The Inferno's Angels. He was a field medic and doc for the Army. He will protect you and help you. You will only be able to contact me the way he says is safe, to make sure Dean can't trace it and find you."" She talks to me the whole time she does the kits. It keeps me sane. ""Don't let him get you and hurt you. You are one of my only friends and I love you."" I tell her crying. ""Don't worry about me sweetheart. I love you too. You keep yourself safe and don't let him get you."" She replies hugging and holding me.

""Okay, let's get you cleaned up. I will call Medic while you bath."" I nod. She helps me undress and get in. I scrub and scrub trying to get clean. I feel so dirty and used. I still think I would be better off dead. I can hear her talking in the next room. I think about slitting my wrist with the razor by the tub. I don't know how long I sit there holding that razor looking at it, debating my future but I heard Leena gasp beside me. I drop the razor. ""Sweetheart, everything that happened isn't your fault. Don't kill yourself and let them win. You win by living."" She says with tears in her eyes. ""I am sorry."" I say going back to scrubbing. She takes the loofah from me. ""Scrubbing yourself raw will hurt you does not make that feeling go away. It will go away. Shower as many times as you want till you feel clean. Just don't scrub all your skin off. Got you something comfy to put on. Come on. We need to hurry. I am afraid Dean will notice you're gone soon and come here."" She rushes me.

I am dress and out in her car headed out of town within minutes. I am so sore but Leena said her friend would have better meds for it so I have to wait. I moan and groan moving around trying to get comfortable. We are on I75 headed away from Miami. Leena looks funny wearing colored contacts, facial prosthetics, big glasses and a hoodie with the hood up. She changed my looks too for the trip. She said it's for the tollbooth cameras. That's also why we are driving a rental under another nurse's name. We traded cars at the hospital. I would find all of this cloak and dagger moves funny, if I didn't know it was necessary. With my hoodie up and her travel pillow, I finally fall asleep from exhaustion.

Leena gently shakes me awake. I notice the dash clock. We have traveled three and half hours. I look out the windows, we are surrounded by trees. There is a small cabin and a man in his 30s on the porch in front of us. Leena gets out first and hugs the man. I slowly exit and grab my bag. I almost cry out in pain walking up to them. He notices how hard of time I am having and approachs me cautiously. With his hands up to show he means no harm he asks, ""I know you are hurt and I will treat you better. I will get you some meds to help. Trust me help is all I want to do, I swear. Can I carry you inside? Just so you don't have to suffer more. By the way my name is Medic."" ""I would greatly appreciate the help so yes. My name is Ivy."" I reply.

I know Leena trusts him, so I will too. I trust Leena with my life. He gently picks me up and carries me bridal style inside to a bedroom. I see medical equipment in here. Makes me relax and trust him more. ""Let Leena help you change into the gown, so I can try to preserve your modesty while I examine and treat you. You can take off the prosthetic and makeup too. Leena the violation kit you did put it in the mini fridge over there to preserve it. Also start an IV on her. Trust me, all we are doing will help you. You are safe here."" Medic informs me. I notice the leather vest he is wearing. He must of noticed me staring. ""It's my kutte. It shows I belong to The Inferno's Angels MC. I do doctor work for them and ride proudly with them."" he says proudly. ""Leena told me."" I reply. He nods and leaves the room. Leena helps remove the makeup and prosthetics. Then helps me into the gown. Once I get on the bed, she starts the IV. She then goes let Medic I am ready.

They return together. I can see his reaction to how badly they hurt me. ""Okay let's get the uncomfortable spots done first. Leena will be right here by me."" He says putting on gloves. I nod. He examines my private part and hip. ""They ripped and tore you so bad, I am going to have to give you some stitches."" He states. I cry silent tears and nod. He gives me a shot and starts stitching. He then applies a cream he tells me that will help. The whole examination goes like this. He applies creams that will help with the bruising and heal the open wounds that don't need stitches. He covers spots with gauze and take pictures of everything that I would need if I decide to prosecute. Finally when that is done, he hooks up and antibiotic bag that goes through the IV incase they had an STD. He gives me the morning after pill just incase. Then a shot for the pain and to help me sleep. Leena gives me a smooch on the head. I thank them both and Leena says bye before the darkness takes me.

I wake up in pain and cry out. The sun is up. I know that means I was out for the night. Medic must have heard me, he comes in with breakfast, coffee, and another shot. ""Good morning. I have breakfast, eat what you can and we will talk. Then I can give you some more meds. They will make you sleep some more but that will help you heal."" Medic says with a smile. ""Good morning. Thanks again for helping me. Did Leena leave? Did she make it back okay?"" I reply. ""She did leave and she let me know she made it back to her friend's place fine. Now I also wanted to offer my MC's help. We can protect you. We can go to court with you and help you get them in prison. You deserve justice for what they did to you."" he offers. I shake my head with my eyes wide totally scared out of my mind. ""They are cops. It won't ever see an inside of a courtroom in Miami. They would make sure of it. They would find something to arrest your MC on or just kill you all one by one. They have already killed another cop who didn't believe their story the last time I was beaten."" I tell him panicking. ""Okay. Then do you want me to bring any of my brothers in on this to help you escape?"" I shake my head. ""Okay I will tell you that if you run into problems on the road, most MCs will help. I will tell you and give you a list which ones to avoid. I will help you anyway I can."" Medic says. ""I need to get to my bank near Miami. I need to close out my account and empty my safety deposit box."" I state. ""We can do that. Today maybe the best time, he will still be looking for you with friends and at hospitals. I will give you a different pain med. It will help but not make you tired. Do you need help getting dressed?"" he asks. I blush and nod. ""Nothing to be embarrassed about. Strictly professional with us, Ivy."" I nod ""Thanks.""

Once I finish eating, he helps me get dressed and carries me to his truck. I give him the address of my bank and we make small talk on our way there. He avoids all of the tolls which I am thankful for. I use his cell to talk to the bank manager on our way there, knowing he can help speed up the process once we get there. He was a friend of my dad's and I know he will help. We pull up to the bank a little pass lunch time. He walks in with me just to be safe. The manager, Daniel, walks up to me. ""I have been watching for you. I have the money ready and in a bag the account is closed. I will walk you down with it for your safety deposit box. Sir you can wait right outside the door for her box, if she wants you too."" Daniel says. "" I do feel safer with him so yes I want that."" I insist. Daniel nods and leads the way carrying the bag. Medic waits right at the door while I empty my box. ""Make sure you get away and he doesn't find you. I hate that Dean and have seen what he has done to you for awhile now."" Daniel says giving me a hug. I shove everything in the bag Daniel has. ""Give the bag to Medic out there. I am to sore to carry it. I am getting away and he won't find me I promise. Thanks for everything. I will miss you since you and dad was close. Bye,"" I say hugging him back. ""Bye"" he mumbles to me. We walk out and hands the bag to Medic, who looks surprised by it's weight. ""Do you mind carrying that for me?"" I ask. ""Not at all. Don't think you should try to carry anything this heavy yet anyways. We better hurry and leave incase he is watching your accounts."" he replies. Daniel tells us security cameras went down at lunch and won't be back up till we leave. I smile and say thanks. I know he did that so Dean couldn't get the videos.

I spend a few days with Medic healing and learning some about MCs, secure ways to communicate, how to disappear, and much more. He is a great guy and I promise to keep in touch as much as I can, only using the ways he taught me that are secure. He helps me disguise myself and drives me to the train station. He walks up and buys my ticket for me. I slip 10000 in an envelope and a note into his kutte, he left it on the seat when he went to buy my ticket. When he comes back, I hop out and give him a hug. ""This will get you to Virginia. From there you can get other places. Good luck sweetheart. You have became like a sister to me, so contact me when you can. I will miss you."" Medic says hugging me back. He pulls back and gives me a smooch on the forehead. ""I will miss you too. I promise I will keep you updated as I can. You are like a brother to me too."" I tell him with teary eyes. I grab my bags. He gave me a burner phone. He told me to get rid of it once I get to my friend's place and get a new one then. We wave our goodbyes as I make a dash for my train that they are calling.

Once I get to Virginia, I get a train to Dallas. Then from Dallas a bus to Utah. There I meet up with Sarah. Thank God, Dean doesn't know about Sarah. We drive the 3 hours back to her house where she has a car for me. She bought it and I am paying her back. It is registered to her so no tracing me that way either. I tell her my story and we catch up a little. I update Medic through the way he taught me and destroy the phone. I plan to buy a new burner but forget. I removed my disguise at Sarah's and tell her bye. I have a map. I plan to travel backroads and avoid all tolls or anyway I can be tracked. I start off towards Colorado first. Then I will head north towards Washington. Criss crossing and doing all I can to avoid being tracked. For me this is a matter of life and death.

...

After nearly 72 hours of driving with only stops for coffee, gas, and bathroom breaks. That's after 3 days on a bus to a town 3 hours away from the only friend, Dean doesn't know about. An old friend from junior high. I had Sarah meet me 3 hours away from her home so he couldn't find out about her, hopefully. She was sweet enough to buy me a car in her name. Also, she tells me about a cousin who could make me new documents with a new ID. I still have a while to go to get to Washington. I hope that all the way across the country from my Miami, Florida roots will be far enough. I am so happy to see a sign for Jamestown 15 miles. I am hopeful that I can stop for some dinner.

As usual, luck is not on my side. Just a mile past the sign my car starts to smoke and then dies. It's about 8 o'clock in the evening, nearly dark on a deserted back road. ""Great,"" I say talking to myself. ""Just my luck. What now? I have no phone, since they can be traced, a broken car, and miles from anywhere."" I scream and start to cry. I am having myself a big Ol' pity party. I don't even hear the vehicle pull up behind me. I am startled by the tapping on my window. I glance to see a kind-looking woman in her 40s. She has a few tattoos with kind gray eyes and a sweet smile. I crack my window and say a timid, ""Hello?"" ""Hello sweetheart, my name is Sheila. Do you need some help?"" Sheila gasps as she notices the healing bruises but doesn't say anything and smiles kindly at me. ""Yes, please. Do you have a phone or know somewhere I can get my car fixed?"" I ask. ""By the way my name is Ivy."" I state and give her a timid smile again. ""Closest shop is about 45 minutes away and ran by my husband and sons,"" Sheila answers. ""Also, yes you can use my phone. Do you have family or friends nearby that you are going to?"" ""No. My family is all dead and no friends near here."" I answer. ""I need to call a friend to let her know what happened, so she doesn't expect me tomorrow."" Sheila hands me her phone to make my call. She also steps back to her SUV to give me some privacy. I call Sarah and let her know to tell the guy in Seattle that I am broke down and will let him know when I can get there.

I open my door and walk back to Sheila. ""Thanks for the use of the phone. Do you think you husband or sons could tow and look at my car?"" I ask. ""Of course, they can. Before I call them, I can see your bruises and I figure you are running from a bad situation. That is fine but I want to let you know in case you are scared of men right now.... my husband is the president of the Sons of Silence MC. My sons are in the MC too. The shop is owned and run by the club members. I can promise that they won't hurt you and will protect you while you are here."" Sheila quickly tells me. I am a little scared of the idea, but I hope I can trust Sheila. ""I am running from an abusive ex and his partner. They are both cops back in Miami. I am scared of men, but I trust you, so I will deal. Hopefully, it doesn't take long for my car to be fixed, I need to get to a friend of a friend that can help with a false identity."" I tell her. ""Since it is late on a Saturday, they won't be able to work on it until Monday, but they will have a prospect with the tow truck come to tow it,"" she informs me.

""Screw!"" I exclaim, ""Is there a motel or hotel near where I can get a room?"" ""Not without ID and since you are running and hiding, I don't think you want that,"" Sheila states. ""But I do have a spare room that you are welcome to though. Just grab what you need and hop in with me. I will take you home with me,"" Sheila tells me. ""Thank you. Are you sure your family won't mind? I don't want to cause any trouble."" I inform her nervously. ""It will be fine. I am sure and it is no trouble at all."" Sheila states. I grab a few bags from my trunk and puts them in the back of the SUV. Sheila tells me when I get in the passenger seat, that she has to stop by the clubhouse to drop off a couple of items. She promises it won't take long and right after that we will head to her house. I buckle in and try to start to relax for the first time in nearly a week. I don't even notice my eyelids getting heavy as the darkness takes me.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

We were scheduled for the shoot house at 0800 hours. It was 0732 when he finally came in and told me.

""The six of you,"" the bastard said as he sat down with a cup of coffee. ""First sargent won't let me split you up, but I don't have to let you leave the wire until I'm good and ready."" He glared up at me. ""Git,"" he ordered with a dismissive nod.

I snapped to attention and turned to run back to our hooch and get the girls. We had less than thirty minutes and this time it was full kit. Something told me, if we didn't do perfectly, Garwood wouldn't let us go on missions.

""That right BASTARD!"" Bobbie yelled, throwing something hard against the wall as she got her body armor and weapons together. ""How does he expect you to do the shoot house after standing in his fucking OFFICE all night?""

""I've done more on less sleep,"" I responded, shouldering into my armor. ""Besides, we don't have to beat him this time."" I grinned at her and she returned it weakly. ""He'll fuck up eventually, and we can stomp on him then.""

""Damn straight,"" Sam said, coming into the room all ready to go. ""You guys ready yet? It's 7:50 and we gotta go.""

""They aren't going to start without us,"" Toni replied, carrying her helmet under her arm, but otherwise just as ready as Sam. They all had tighter fitting uniforms than most Terrans, but Toni's was positively snug.

""The way Sargent Garwood is acting right now, they might,"" I retorted, slipping my helmet on.

""He's that angry?"" Billie asked coming into the common room and sitting down to fasten her boots.

""He's something,"" Bobbie muttered as she put her helmet on and slung her rifle. The Mroaw military usually used energy based small arms, but the Gestalt has always used chemically propelled projectiles and the girls were adapting admirably. They were also getting accustomed to always having and sometimes using their sidearms, another thing the Mroaw typically don't do.

""Cut the chatter and get to the house,"" I ordered sternly but not harshly. We were all ready and my HUD said we had five minutes.

They all filed out and I brought up the rear as we trotted to the shoot house. It wasn't particularly impressive. Just a configurable layout made of stacks of sand filled tires on moveable platforms. It just took up a lot of space…until you looked at it through the HUD in your visor.

Your HUD shows you all kinds of things: your position on a map of the given area, the names and positions of friendly units, the known locations of enemy units, even certain carried supply information. It can, when needed, even be programmed to make a training situation more realistic and emersive. Like in the shoot house.

""You bitches better not fowl this up,"" Garwood said as we walked up to the firing line.

I pinged Bobbie not to say anything and replied, ""We'll complete the task to standard, sar'ent.""

""Uh-huh,"" he muttered as a buzzer that was our start signal went off.

A time limit came up on our HUDs and we moved through the shoot house fluidly. It was set to simulate a jungle at night and our helmets fed us all the sights and sounds, tinted green like our night vision. The opposing force, or OPFOR, were set to represent Gorcillian shock troopers, so we had to watch the trees as much as the ground. Simulated chemical mines would also go off if triggered, but our kits were hermetically sealed against environmental hazards, so we weren't too worried.

And then it happened. Six super predators from the Mroaw home world, Mroawr, showed up. They were like giant carnivorous rhinos with opposable thumbs or something. Toni, Billie, and Alex froze as Sam, Bobbie, and I riddled them with bullets.

""You guys ok?"" I asked as I loaded my last mag into my rifle.

""What the hell was that?"" Billie whispered. ""Those were [proper noun for indigenous super predator]. What were they doing here?""

""Throwing you off your game,"" I answered, putting my hand on her shoulder and shaking her gently.

She shook visibly and turned to me. ""Right.""

""They're all but extinct on Mroawr,"" Toni muttered. ""How did they get here?""

""They didn't,"" I pointed out, shooting a Gorcillian commando out of a tree behind her. ""He put them in the sim to throw you off.""

""...why?..."" Alex asked as she aimed at and missed another commando.

""Because he's an asshole,"" Bobbie answered, finishing him off for her. She and Sam were also dangerously low on rifle ammo. Those rhino things took more bullets to put down than anything I've had to shoot before.

""He wants us to fail so he can point out how shit we are to first sar'ent,"" I pointed out as the sim started to rain. ""...fuck…""

We were 30 seconds from completing the exfil in our objective…when red lightning flashed across the sky. All five of them froze. And then the thunder struck.

Bobbie and Sam turned to each and started shaking their heads slowly, moving closer together and cuddling each other. Billie dropped her rifle, covered her ears with her hands and squatted to the ground where she stood. Toni screamed and dove for a giant tree root. And Alex froze so still I thought her suit might've locked up.

Im 35 and I've been a fan since I was a kid. I used to skip class in high-school and drive to the park in the morning to wake and bake and listen to you in 2008. The good Ole days.

This last week you have been more energized than you have been in years and it sucks that it took Hogan to die for that to happen. You feel relevant again because youre getting a lot of attention and I'm not hating, I think you deserve the attention. You're the only guy that called it right and you called it before anyone even thought it. It was a complete shock to most people who don't listen to you. I feel like you definitely did have some inside sources, but you knew hogan so well that when news dried up of him doing gigs you noticed and started digging to see what's going on. I also think you are correct in saying that there should be an autopsy performed, and there is some shady shit going on but I bet he has already been cremated. Condolences to you for losing your best friend. You have been grieving him for 13 years and I hope you can finally get some closure. The sad thing is that if Terry didn't cut you out of his life I think that he would still be alive.

With that said you have another friend that you need to make up with. Life is short and you just lost Hogan. You need to pick up the phone and call Mike Waters and have a conversation. You need Manson as much as he needs you. You need Ned to hook people into your show. Ned is what got my dad listsning and its how i got all my friends to listen. Ned is the ultimate hook for getting new listeners playing off of bubbas perfect set ups. No one could set up ned like bubba can and you guys need eachother. Just apologize and move forward. Agree to disagree and make some money together again. Bring him and Trace back into the mix and your show will be funny again. His shows don't get a lot of views but they are funny and good shows. They are real and raw and funny. Cluster fuck, the bar show, the hang would all work great on the bubba network podcasts.

Trace is naturally a funny guy and you can use him as a stunt guy/ on the street guy/ content creator guy and you desperately need that. What your show is missing is all the stunts, activities, content you used to do and I'm not talking about peeing in coffee cans!! 

Bubba just pick up the phone and call Mike and have a conversation. Clear the air. Bubba, Manson/ ned, Seth, lummy could be a an amazing lineup. 

You could also do manson/Ned remotely like you do tuddle or even part time.

1mfgx25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1mfgx25/i_cleared_pmp/,I cleared PMP!,"Guys, I cleared my PMP today! The first thing I did is posted on my LinkedIn and updated my resume! lol!

Next, I wanted to update in this group because I got lots of insights here! 

Let me give you a background here - I enrolled for PMP on 29 May and by June end I had completed by 35 hours PDU of AR's udemy and gave one random mock test and I got 72% ish or so. Then I had taken AR's random mock tests (Bought this 4 mock tests pack) and I got 65% and another 45% and then 50% and so just like scores my confidence also dropped and was rethinking my choices. 

I prepared for another month. Went through course again - Watched DM's youtube video of practice questions and MR's mindset video etc. Then I retook one of the mock test and got 80% (It was easiest). I retook other mock tests and again got 65% and I again panicked. Then I saw lots of posts here and understood many of them were getting lesser results in mock tests but anyway registered for exam and cracked it!

Tips from test-

* I didn't enroll for PMP Study Hall as I didn't want to spend anymore money but good if it works for you but I will tell you this - You will get possibly 10% mock tests questions in real test. Atleast that's what happened with me. 
* Only thing you need from this PMP course to crack test is - MINDSET. That's it!
* I didn't get a single process related course - am talking about ITTOS, Data Analysis related direct questions.
* I got 3 drag drops, 2 EVM related questions and I guessed both EVM related answers because I didn't memorise/study concept of EVMs as I didn't want to trouble myself anymore.
* Every question was situational, That's why I mentioned to develop MINDSET. Ofcourse you need to study though. Go through MR's principles.
* Most important obstacle for my to avoid getting Brain Fog. I have anxieties so I didn't sleep a single minute and to avoid fatigue I took cold shower, had black coffee and possibly ate half a sandwich and few nuts. These tests are scenario based and few questions are 5 to 6 sentences long, You gotta read it! so by the time you reach 100th question, Your brain gets tired. To avoid this, Have some caffeine if you want to. If you anxities like me, may be have half a cup. But please guys, sleep a night before properly. Don't do like me!
* Keep tab on time too! I thought I was doing on time, I took 10 min break and then 5 min break. I rushed through last 10 questions, Had like 3 mins - I didn't get a chance to read the questions, I looked at answer and knew this might be right! Pure Gut instinct. Do not overthink the answers guys. Go by instinct!

I had mixed feeling after test completion - I may pass or fail. Anything can happen. I gave my test at home at around 8:15 am and last screen mentioned - You will receive result in 48 hours or so. I got the results at 9pm that I passed - People & Business environment - AT and Process - T. Pass works for me! Good Luck to you guys! Go and register for exam and get it done. Just develop Mindset!

I work nights from 6pm to 6am. Due to my frame, musculature and history with being physically fit I believe Im about 25-30lbs over weight.

Monday the 28th of July started a 72 hour fast.

Thursday at 9am (73 hours into fast) I consumed 6 eggs and 4 strips of bacon. This actually led to another 36 hour fast which wasn’t intentional I simply wasn’t hungry. 

Tonight (5 days into this) I have lost 10.5lbs (water I know)

When I got to work I ate a blend of shredded chicken breast, scrambled eggs and bacon (think omelette)

I also am taking physillium husk, methylated multi vitamin, essential minerals, electrolytes, vitamin b complex, and vitamin D.

My goal is to eat a no carb diet and water with the occasional coffee/tea with no sweater artificial or otherwise until I lose 25-30lbs and no longer despise the way I look

IT has Strange RULES TO FOLLOW!,"**Have you ever asked yourself why certain rules exist—rules that feel stitched together not by logic, but by fear?**

Like… *“Don’t whistle after dark.”* Or *“Never look into a mirror at midnight.”*

They sound like folklore, don’t they? The kind of stuff your grandmother whispered to you while locking the doors and pulling the curtains tight. But what if... one of those rules wasn't just superstition? What if one of those rules was the only thing standing between you and something *you were never meant to hear?*

**“Don’t answer the second phone after midnight.”**

That was the exact line printed in bold, underlined red ink, on the rules sheet I was handed my first night working at a backwoods radio station.

And the worst part? I still don’t know who—or what—was going to be on the other end of that call.

I was 26 years old, broke, heartbroken, and running from the shattered mess of a life I’d tried to build in Seattle. My engagement had crumbled like wet drywall. So I did what cowards do—I vanished. Drove for hours until I landed in a nowhere town with a name no one remembers.

**Granger Hollow.**

It had one gas station, a sad little diner where everyone stopped talking the moment you walked in, and a forest that felt like it was always watching. The only light at night blinked red at the edge of Main Street—as if warning you not to go any farther.

That’s where I found **WZRP 104.6**, a forgotten radio station squatting on a lonely hill seven miles outside town. It looked like it had been built during the Cold War and never updated. Rust clung to the frame like scabs. Two rooms, a flickering hallway, and the smell of old coffee that had soaked into the walls.

They paid in cash. No taxes, no paperwork, no names.

Which was perfect. Because I didn’t want to be found.

The guy training me, Darren, looked like he had survived the station, but just barely. His skin was sallow, teeth the color of old ivory. Every few minutes, his eyes would flick to the clock like he was counting down a bomb.

As he left, he handed me one piece of paper. No contract. No instructions. Just… *rules.*

**WZRP NIGHTSHIFT RULES – READ CAREFULLY**

* Lock both doors by 11:45 p.m. sharp. No exceptions.
* Don’t let anyone in. Even if they say they work here.
* Only play the tapes labeled “OK” in red.
* Don’t answer the second phone after midnight.
* If the on-air light turns blue, go to the basement immediately and stay there.
* If you hear breathing from the transmitter room, turn off the hallway lights and wait.
* Don’t leave before 6:00 a.m., even if your replacement shows up early.

I chuckled. It had to be a prank, right? Some kind of hazing ritual Darren pulled on all the newbies.

But when I looked up, Darren wasn’t smiling.

His eyes were dead serious. Hollow.

**“Follow the rules,”** he rasped, **“or you won’t last a week.”**

I should’ve walked out right then. But I was broke, exhausted, and honestly? I just wanted to be left alone. Peace and quiet. That’s all I wanted.

That first night was eerie, but not unbearable. I played dusty rock tapes, read out weather updates for towns that probably didn’t even exist anymore, and tried not to think about the rules. The air smelled faintly of mildew and scorched wires. A hint of something older underneath, like dead things kept in a jar.

Still, the real chill came every time I passed the **transmitter room**. The door was always closed—but I could swear I felt a breeze leaking out from under it.

**Cold. Like standing in front of an open grave.**

At exactly 11:45, I locked both doors. First rule checked.

Then, at **12:07 a.m.,** the second phone rang.

There were two phones on the desk. One was beige, plastic, ugly—probably from Walmart. The other?

**Jet black. Rotary dial. Heavy as sin.** It looked like it had once sat on a military desk during DEFCON 1.

And that was the one ringing.

No caller ID. No reason. Just that slow, old-fashioned ring that hit something deep in your spine. Like the sound didn’t belong in the world anymore.

I froze.

Seven times, it rang. Seven times, I sat there, trying not to breathe.

Then it stopped.

I exhaled like I’d just surfaced from deep water. I had no idea I’d been holding my breath that long. But I hadn’t answered. That was the rule. And for now, I was safe.

The next few nights felt off, but manageable. Occasionally, I’d hear static from rooms that weren’t broadcasting. I started catching glimpses of movement in the glass reflection—just out of sync with my own. But nothing ever came of it.

I told myself it was sleep deprivation. Or nerves. Or loneliness.

But then came **night six**.

And that was the night when the air changed. When the rules stopped feeling like folklore... …and started feeling like **a warning.**

**Some nights pretend to be normal—right up until they turn on you.**

That evening started the way the last few had: quiet, still, and lying to me.

I brought the same scratched thermos full of burnt gas station coffee. Locked up at **11:45 p.m. sharp**, just like the first rule demanded. The place creaked like old bones as I walked the halls, flipping through a stack of tapes with fading labels. Most were garbage. But I found one marked **“OK - RED”**—the kind I was *allowed* to play.

So I slid it in.

Felt safe. Almost bored. **Almost.**

At exactly **12:02**, the black phone rang again.

But this time… I didn’t jump.

Didn’t flinch. Didn’t breathe. Just stared.

The rotary phone’s ring had become part of the landscape by now. Like thunder that never brings rain. It rang seven times, slow and deliberate. Then, as expected, it died.

I turned back to my notes—tried to focus on the music levels, my voice lines, the time check.

**That’s when the air changed.**

At **12:04**, the *on-air light* turned blue.

And just like that—**I wasn’t bored anymore.**

My entire body locked up. The hair on my arms stood straight. My mouth went dry like I’d swallowed dust.

Blue light. That was on the list. I remembered the rule:

**“If the on-air light turns blue, go to the basement immediately and stay there.”**

Only problem? **No one ever showed me where the damn basement was.**

Panic doesn’t hit all at once. It trickles in—first the heartbeat, then the trembling hands, then the voice in your head screaming *MOVE.*

I shot out of the booth, hallway lights flickering above me like they couldn’t make up their minds. I started yanking doors open—one led to a supply closet full of empty tape boxes and dead spiders. Another opened to a restroom so small it barely deserved the name.

All the while, that *blue light* pulsed behind me, steady and unnatural. Not LED. Not halogen. More like... moonlight if the moon hated you.

But this blue light brought a vibration, deep and angry, like the ceiling was holding back a growl.

Then I found it.

Tucked in the back of the breakroom behind a half-collapsed tower of audio gear: a **rug**, faded and stained. Beneath it—**a square hatch**, old and iron, edges rusted like they’d been weeping blood.

I yanked it open. The hinges screamed.

Did I hesitate?

Not for a second.

The ladder led straight down into a tight shaft. The cold clung to me immediately—**not the kind of cold you escape with a jacket. The kind that gets inside you.** I climbed down anyway, rung after rung, until the hatch above became a square of flickering light, then vanished as I shut it behind me.

And then... the **smell** hit.

**Damp earth. Rusted metal. Wet fur.** And beneath it all—**something sweet. Something rotten.**

The basement wasn’t big. Just a single square of concrete with a **low ceiling**, like the building itself was pressing down to keep something contained. There was a **cot** in one corner, a **filing cabinet** long since rusted shut, and a **radio**, humming softly with static like it was breathing in and out.

I stood there, frozen, watching the shadows twitch.

Then, after a few minutes, the **blue light above clicked off.**

Suddenly, the vibration was gone.

Not stopped. Gone.

Like it had never been there at all.

But I didn’t climb up.

Not yet.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The static buzzed like it was whispering something just beneath human hearing.

Only when my knees started to lock did I finally climb back up the ladder, one cautious rung at a time.

The booth looked the same.

At first.

But then I saw it—**the tape I’d been playing was shredded.** Not chewed. Not worn. **Torn.** Unspooled like someone had tried to rip it apart with their bare hands—or claws.

And then I saw the desk.

Three deep gouges, **parallel**, six inches long, carved into the wood right next to the mic.

Like something had tried to reach through... or *out.*

I checked the security cameras—my fingers trembling on the keys.

Nothing.

Every feed showed stillness. Empty hallways. Silent doors.

But that was the thing—**the footage never showed what happened.** It only showed what was *left behind.*

I went home that morning and lay in bed without sleeping, staring up at the ceiling as if it could give me answers. But it just stared back.

**There’s a moment in every nightmare when you realize it’s not going to end. Not this time. Not when you wake up. Not when the sun rises.**

That moment hit me around **2:17 a.m.**, during what I thought would be a quiet shift.

Everything had been silent. Still. Like the station itself was asleep.

But then… the hallway lights **flickered once**—then died.

Just like that, I was surrounded by shadows.

The air thinned. My pulse quickened.

I remembered one of the rules:

**“If you hear breathing from the transmitter room, turn off the hallway lights and wait.”**

Only... the lights were *already off.*

And what I heard wasn’t breathing.

It was **whispering**.

Dozens of voices, **overlapping**, broken, and layered like someone had taken five radio signals and tangled them together. Some voices were slow, almost crooning. Others were fast, like they were trying to warn me before something caught up.

But I couldn’t make out a single word.

**Not one.**

I stayed frozen in my chair. Muscles locked. Eyes wide. Trying not to blink too loud.

The whispers swirled around the walls.

And then…

**A scratch.**

From outside the booth.

Just a single, slow scrape.

**Like a fingernail... dragging across the glass.**

I turned to the sound, heart trying to pound through my ribs. The booth lights were off. The studio beyond the glass looked like a tomb.

I flipped the lights on.

**Nothing.**

No one.

Just empty hallway, peeling paint, and darkness that felt thicker than it should.

But then I looked again.

**Smudges.**

On the outside of the glass. Five of them. Finger marks.

**Small. Too small. Like a child’s hand.**

But I was *alone.*

At least—I *thought* I was.

I finished that shift with a **knife** across my lap and my back to the wall.

**Night Eight.**

I arrived early, hoping to catch Darren.

Hoping maybe I could ask what the hell I had gotten into.

But Darren wasn’t there.

Instead, there was someone else. Sitting on the steps in front of the station like she’d been waiting for me.

A woman. Mid-thirties. Pale. Stringy black hair, hoodie zipped all the way up to her chin. No car. No bag. Nothing.

Just... sitting there.

She looked up.

**“Are you the night guy?”**

Her voice was flat. Like someone who had seen too much to be surprised anymore.

I didn’t answer.

She stood.

**Her eyes were wrong.**

No white. Just **black—full pupils**, swallowing up every bit of light around them.

**“I used to work here,”** she said. **“Before they changed the rules.”**

That line hit like a punch.

She took a step toward me.

I instinctively backed up—toward my car, keys gripped tight in my fist.

**“You shouldn’t be here after tonight,”** she said, voice soft, like she was warning me from a burning building.

**“They’re getting stronger.”**

“Who?” I asked, my voice barely holding together.

She didn’t answer.

Just turned… and walked into the woods.

No flashlight. No trail. Just vanished between the trees like she’d never been there.

I waited five minutes, eyes locked on that tree line.

She never came back out.

That night, **the black phone didn’t ring.**

But at **3:06 a.m.**, the *other phone* did.

The beige one. Cheap. Modern. Harmless-looking.

I stared at it.

Technically… the rules never said I *couldn’t* answer that one.

So I did.

**Static.**

Just for a moment.

Then—

**A voice. Whispered. Close. Like it was behind me, not through the line.**

**“You’re not following them.”**

**Click.**

The line went dead.

I dropped the phone like it was on fire and stared at the rules sheet pinned to the wall.

Read it once.

Twice.

Looking for anything I missed.

And that’s when I saw it.

At the very bottom of the page—in tiny, faded print. Almost invisible.

**“Every time you survive the blue light, a new rule is added. You must find it before your next shift.”**

What?

I flipped the paper over.

**Nothing.**

Held it to the lamp—watched the light bleed through the sheet—and there it was:

**Faint red ink**, hidden behind the typed text. Smudged, but legible.

I rubbed my thumb over the words.

And they **rose** like bruises.

**8. Never say your real name on-air.** *It hears names. It remembers.*

That’s when I realized…

The rules weren’t just keeping things *out.*

They were keeping *me* from being seen. From being heard.

Because something—**somewhere inside this station**—was always listening.

I broke the eighth rule.

Not on purpose. Not loudly. Just once.

**But it was enough.**

And when I heard my own name whispered back to me—**from inside the transmitter room**—I knew…

There’s no hiding anymore.

**Have you ever felt the world tilt—not with motion, but with meaning?** Like everything around you is suddenly wrong, and the air itself knows your name?

I walked into the station that night with **shaking hands** and eyes red from another night without sleep.

But it wasn’t exhaustion gnawing at me.

It was fear. *Raw, creeping, marrow-deep fear.*

Because I’d seen the hidden rule.

**“Never say your real name on-air.”**

And I had. **Every. Single. Night.**

**“Hey, this is Nate. You’re listening to WZRP 104.6…”**

God help me—I’d *fed it.*

At **12:00 a.m. sharp**, the black phone rang.

Same as always. That ancient rotary buzz, slow and deliberate like a countdown.

I didn’t answer.

I couldn’t.

Instead, I walked to the breakroom, pried back the dusty rug, and opened the hatch.

The basement.

I had to know what was really down there.

What I’d been hiding from all this time.

But when I lifted the hatch—

**Something was different.**

The cot was **gone**.

In its place, carved into the concrete like something had burst up from *beneath* it…

**Was a hole.**

Not man made. Not natural.

**Torn. Clawed. Violent.** The jagged edges of the cement curled upward like it had melted and ripped at the same time.

And the dirt around it was scattered—**not from something coming in… but from something getting out.**

I stepped back, slow and shaking.

Then the radio hissed.

**Loud. Sharp. Alive.**

And then—**I heard my own voice.**

*“Hey, this is Nate. You’re listening to WZRP 104.6, the Pulse of Nowhere—keeping you company through the long, cold night.”*

**My exact words. From Night One.**

But I hadn’t hit play.

The **tape deck was off.**

I ran—**sprinted**—back to the booth, adrenaline cutting through the fog in my brain.

The red “ON AIR” light was glowing. Normal. Calm. Lying.

I reached for the mic switch to cut the feed.

And that’s when it changed.

**The light turned blue.**

Everything stopped.

**No static. No hum. No music.**

Just **dead air.**

And then—

**Breathing.**

Heavy. Wet. Uneven.

But it wasn’t coming from the transmitter room this time.

**It was inside the booth.**

With me.

**Behind me.**

I turned.

**Slow.**

And in the far corner—**just past where the shadows met the wall—was something standing.**

**Tall.**

**Thin.**

**Barely there—like heat distortion wearing skin.**

It had **no face**.

But its mouth opened.

And inside that mouth... **were my own teeth.**

I bolted.

Out the door. Down the hall. Past the transmitter room. Past walls still scarred from claw marks.

The building groaned around me. The shadows felt heavier. Like they were watching me.

I didn’t stop.

Didn’t close the hatch.

Didn’t climb down.

**I jumped.**

Straight into the basement.

The air was colder than before.

Colder than death.

The blue light above pulsed through the cracks like it was bleeding.

Then—

**A thud.**

Above me. Then another.

Something had followed me.

It didn’t care about the rules anymore.

It had **been invited.**

And then, in that pitch-black basement—my back against the wall, lungs burning—I remembered something.

A whisper. Barely more than a mumble.

**Something Darren had said to me my first night.**

**“They only get in if you break three rules.”**

Three.

**I counted.**

1. **I said my name on-air.**
2. **I didn’t find the new rule in time.**
3. **I answered the beige phone.**

Three.

Not just mistakes.

**Keys.**

Each rule wasn’t just a warning.

**They were locks.**

And every one I broke?

**Turned the key the wrong way.**

Now the lock was undone.

Now the door was open.

And **something** had stepped through.

The rules weren’t just there to protect me.

They were there to contain *it.*

And now, it knew my name.

**I don’t remember climbing out of the basement.** I don’t remember the stairs. The hatch. The door.

All I know is—I woke up in my car.

Half in a ditch.

Parked sideways on the gravel road that led up to the station.

The windshield was cracked. The radio was dead. My hands were covered in blood. **Not mine.**

I stumbled out, lungs aching, head full of static.

Looked up toward the hill.

**WZRP 104.6 was gone.**

Nothing but a scorched black skeleton silhouetted against the dawn. The tower was a twisted metal husk. The booth, the hallway, the transmitter room—**all burned to the ground.**

But I didn’t have a single burn on me.

Not even soot.

And no one in town said a word about it.

I walked into the diner that morning like a man returning from war.

The bell above the door jingled like normal.

The waitress looked up.

Didn’t flinch. Didn’t gasp. Just said—

**“You lasted longer than the last guy.”**

No questions. No sympathy. No disbelief.

Just… acknowledgement.

Like I’d completed a shift someone else had abandoned years ago.

I didn’t respond.

Didn’t sit down.

Didn’t order coffee.

Just turned and left.

That afternoon, I packed what little I had and left Idaho behind without a single goodbye.

Didn’t even leave a note.

But I took something with me.

**The rules.**

I don’t know why.

I couldn’t bring myself to throw them away.

Even after the station was ash, even after the nightmare ended—or *pretended* to—I kept that single sheet of paper.

**Folded. Worn. Still faintly warm, somehow.**

I tucked it into my glove compartment. Sometimes I check it. Make sure it’s real. That I didn’t make it all up.

**Eight rules.**

Still printed in the same weird, off-kilter type.

Still signed by no one.

But this morning… when I checked it again...

**There were nine.**

Same faint red ink. Same pressure like it had been scrawled in a hurry, in fear.

A new rule. One I’d never seen before.

**9. If you ever leave, never talk about the station out loud.** *It still listens. It still remembers.*

I stared at it for a long time.

Mouth dry. Hands trembling.

I hadn’t said anything.

Not out loud.

Just typed. Just written.

That’s different, right?

**…Right?**

I’m not saying this out loud.

You’re just reading it.

**That’s different.**

It has to be.

Because if it isn’t?

If that counts?

Then something is already listening.",3,1754106785.0,Ruleshorror,3,1.0,False
1mfgv1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1mfgv1j/favorite_discontinued_scents/,Favorite discontinued scents?,"Hi IMAM! Whenever I look for reviews of scents I’m interested in, I always inevitably find scents that are discontinued (or even whole houses that don’t exist anymore, rip) and some of them sound so dreamy to me! I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately and was wondering what are your favorite discontinued indie scents? Do you wish you could try them/did you actually get to, or have any reviews to share? I would love to know!

I love Luvmilk’s catalogue so much but I got into them too late to try any of these :( I fantasize about how lovely they must be! Especially Midnight Snack and Unicorn Princess. The concept behind each scent along with their notes are so magical n fun, and scratch a lot of scent profile itches for me. Here are some of my personal favorites from Luvmilk I wish I got the chance to try:

* **Midnight Snack:** Golden hops, warm baked bread, a squeeze of orange and honey drizzled over crunchy granola, and just a touch of vanilla bean.
* **Unicorn Princess:** Root bear, ice cream, maraschino cherries, and marshmallow fluff.
* **Senpai’s Kiss:** Coffee milk, cotton candy, a cashmere sweater, and soft school satchel leather.
* **Slumber Party:** Rich milk chocolate with just the right blend of vanilla, brown sugar, and salted caramel; hints of coconut milk and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
* **Wedding Day:** Freshly baked blackberry pastries drizzled with vanilla and lemon sugar, layered with slices of ripe juicy peaches, and delicate cognac infused rose petals.
* **Suite Kiss:** Fragrant blackberry amidst sweet baked bread, a dash of vanilla, and delicious buttery goodness; like toast with blackberry jam for breakfast!
* **Shark Food:** Warm campfire, sweet marshmallow, melted chocolate, and a dash of cinnamon toffee.
* **Shark Pup:** Salty sea spray meets sugary cotton candy from the boardwalk in addition to vanilla and creamy coconut.
* **Secret Crush:** Smooth white chocolate, fresh raspberry, vanilla bean, and hints of creamy butter.
* **Rabbit Crown:** Delicate rose petals, sweet raspberry, and red hibiscus.

And here are some of my favorites from another house I really love, Morari! These all sound so cozy, especially Year Round Fall and Green Tea Layer Cake!:

* **Year Round Fall:** Apricot, cashmere, sandalwood, tonka bean, pine needle.
* **Green Tea Layer Cake:** Green tea layer cake with rhubarb jam, topped with maple-cardamom buttercream and lemon zest.
* **Cottagecore:** Chamomile, Elderflower, Raspberry, White Tea.
* **Eden:** Rose, Lavender, Honey, Fern, Grass.
* **Frolicsome:** Green Tea, Strawberry, Honeydew, Honey, Light Musk.

1mfgsg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mfgsg7/not_sure_if_im_expecting_too_much_of_boyfriend/,Not sure if I’m expecting too much of boyfriend,"I’m making this post to try to understand if I’m being overly critical of my boyfriend for no reason, or if he’s genuinely not doing enough. I’ve felt so burnt out lately that I’m starting to resent him for certain things and I’m not sure whether or not it’s justified. 

I’ll start by saying that he’s the sole breadwinner right now until I go back to work in a month. So for 5 months he’s been working a full time job while I’ve been with the baby full time. He also helps me whenever I ask him to and encourages me to go out and have ~me time~ during weekends. 

But I’ve found myself being upset that when he comes home after work, he plays video games for the rest of the day until bedtime. The baby goes to sleep at 7:30/8, and sometimes we’ll hang out or watch a movie before we go to sleep. So his routine is get home, play video games, shower, and hang out with me. 

If I’m feeling extra stressed I’ll ask him to keep her with him while I cook dinner or he’ll put her to sleep, but I’ve noticed usually when he’s with her he sits her in front of the tv while he plays video games or he lets her cry if he tried to soothe her and it didn’t work. 

I haven’t taken a shower on my own unless I tell him to take her (usually only over the weekends) or his mom or my mom offer to watch her. And I rarely do other things by myself in general unless it’s when she’s in bed at night. 

Sometimes he’ll ask me if I want to do something with him once the baby is napping, but doesn’t understand that her naps rarely last over 30 minutes. He also thinks we should let her cry it out if it seems to be taking her too long to fall asleep or she’s fighting it, which I personally don’t agree with. 

So maybe that’s why he rarely takes over for me. He thinks I can just put her to sleep and then do whatever I want, or let her cry. So I’m basically at home all day doing nothing? Idk

But I’ve been wishing that he would take the baby more and play with her without me having to ask. I’ve been wishing he would tell me to go get my shower or sit and drink a coffee by myself for a moment when he notices I’ve had hours without a break.

I know that he would agree to keeping her with him whenever I ask, but I don’t want to have to ask. I want him to want to hang out with her without worrying that he’s just gonna play his game if she’s with him. 

I want to talk to him about this, but I don’t want to be overly demanding of him because it’s not like he’s not doing anything. He does do a lot.

I'm reaching out in a really tough spot and hoping this amazing community might have some leads or support. My brain feels completely fogged out (thanks, DV & PTSD!), so please bear with me.

My Situation:

I'm a transgender woman (MTF early 30s) , 4 months on HRT. I present feminine and i am feminine. Sadly, coming out led to my family cutting me off completely (was upper-Mid Class now learning how to human all over again!) I'm now homeless in the Chicago area. I work doing food delivery (DoorDash/UberEats/etc.) to scrape by, but it's incredibly unstable, especially without a safe base. I'm actively exploring applying for disability or seeking autism-friendly employment (more on that below).

Who I Am:
*  MTF Transgender: Living authentically as a woman. This is non-negotiable for me. I am the girl in relationships and i refuse to be on a place where I can’t be me. 

*   Autistic (Level 1 / Low Support Needs):I'm independent and functional, but I genuinely struggle with interpersonal skills, social cues, and communication sometimes. I need patience, directness, and understanding ( Some jokes fly by me. Im used to it) 
. Loud/chaotic environments can be overwhelming. I don’t mind music and normal sound. What people can tolerate from obnoxious people is triggering to me. That’s one of the differences. 

*   PTSD:I manage this, this is due to childhood abuse.  Stability and feeling safe are crucial for me right now. My ex partner was not very thrilled to find out that I was planning my escape. I woke up him kicking my teeth in while I was sleeping at 3 am in the morning. Safety is what i need. 

*   Currently:Focused on survival, finding stability, and building a real life here in Chicago. Stress made me forget who I am. But I am a libra, I love helping (people pleasing, don’t wanna fix that) i am artistic and I have a classy/emo taste in fashion (not much so after the escape) I'm kind, respectful of shared spaces, and incredibly grateful for any help. I was running stores for the family business. I am professional and trying to build an online store. I have a luxury-sport car that is my work/home right now. I am sharing this not to brag by any means. I am desperately thinking of ways not to come off sounding like a druggie or a whatever the news are trying to portrait. 

**What I NEED Urgently:**

A ROOM TO RENT: 
My absolute top priority is finding a safe, stable, and TRANS-AFFIRMING place to live ASAP. My budge is $500 a month i know it’s low for chicago but this is what I can do for now at least until I can get the ball rolling. 

What I'm HOPING For (Beyond the room):

*   Community & Friends:Being cut off and homeless is isolating. I desperately want to connect with kind, accepting people in the area especially other LGBTQ+ folks, neurodivergent people, or just anyone with a big heart. Friends to chat with, maybe grab coffee, explore low-cost city things, or just feel less alone would mean the world to me right now. 

* Job leads? i have no clue what jobs are good for an autistic person. I have tried retail. No thank you. 


Please choose kindness in your replies. Nothing above is in my control. Wether it was genetics, birth defects, mere bad luck or tramabind with toxic partners. I am doing the best I can to be the best version I can be.
Much love 💜

Orders were put in around 1500 so I decided to bring my patient some juice and applesauce. I found some bouillon powder to make chicken broth for her-which I did. I used the coffee maker water… 
Brought the stuff into my patients room and set it on the table out of her reach. Left for a second to grab one of her meds that was due. While I was crushing the PO med, I hear her cry out in pain. 
Run into the room and she had grabbed the hot soup and spilled it all down her back. Skin lifting up and she was very clearly badly burned. A few hours later and it’s blistering. She’s in pain and it honestly might leave a scar. 
My preceptor keeps telling me not to beat myself up. To use this as a learning experience. I feel like such an idiot. I feel horrible for hurting my poor little patient. All I’ve been able to do is cry.

What I'm looking for: 

First and foremost, someone who wants to cuddle. I love hugs and physical touch. Someone who is receptive to that. I am looking for something a little more romantic, but platonic is okay too as long as that is communicated. Communication is very important to me.

1mfgfmv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mfgfmv,Progress Update: Down 33.7 lbs on Zepbound (March–July),"Hey everyone — just wanted to share my progress after a few months on Zepbound. I started on 2.5 mg at the end of March and I’m now on 12.5 mg. My starting weight was 268.9 and I’m down to 235.2 as of July 31 — a total loss of 33.7 pounds.

I'm including both a visual of my Noom weight graph and a photo collage to show how things have changed physically. The visual progress keeps me grounded when the scale fluctuates (which it absolutely does).

This hasn’t been perfectly linear — I’ve had a few spikes and plateaus. There were weeks where I’d stall or even go up slightly, and early July especially hit a weird patch. But I stayed consistent, and the downward trend came back.

My routine has been fairly consistent:

Eating mostly keto or low-carb, around 1800–1900 calories/day

No breakfast, just coffee

Using dinner leftovers for lunch the next day

Swimming twice a week, weightlifting once 

Cravings have dropped off a lot — especially for late-night snacking and alcohol. I even feel like my vision has sharpened a bit, which I didn't expect.

I still have a long way to go, but this has been the first time in my life where weight loss hasn’t felt like a daily battle. Zepbound didn’t do all the work, but it gave me enough of a nudge to finally build some momentum.

Happy to answer questions or just connect — I’ve been quietly lurking for a while and thought it was time to post.

It tricks you into thinking you're getting things done, but when you come back the next day, the code is a mess. There's no structure, no plan, no clear goal. You end up building cool things that don’t actually solve the problem.

Vibe coding feels great when the energy is high. But when that vibe fades, you're left trying to untangle decisions you made in the moment without any logic behind them.

It works for small scripts or quick ideas, but not for scalable apps, production code, or collaborative work. Structure, planning, and clear thinking always win in the long run.

I still enjoy the occasional late night flow session, but now I treat vibe coding like a creative break, not my default mode.

Upon walking into the parking lot, my colleague asked if I would like to ride in her car to go there. Since it was only a couple blocks away and our lot is always busy, I didn’t mind as I wouldn’t have to repark my car upon returning. So we carpooled together and returned after our meeting. 

When I came home and told my wife about it, she became very upset with me. Her exact words were “why are you riding in other bitches’ cars?” She said she’s tired of me hurting her like that. A couple years ago, as a team lead, I drove two new team members to meet a client for a work event. My wife was furious at me back then, referring to my colleagues as bitches. A majority of my coworkers are female, and my wife refers to them as such. 

I should have realized that my wife would be upset with me for riding in a woman’s car. She said it looks extremely bad in her culture that a married man would be in a car with another woman. I didn’t think of it that way, and now I’m again, in the doghouse for fucking up. This isn’t the first time I’ve done stupid things that hurt her so much. I need to stop doing things that hurt her so, even if I don’t see it at first, and think more on her perspective because I’m being an insensitive ass to my wife’s feelings.

I’m new here and wanted to share a bit about where I’m at.

I’m 30, recently lost a job I’d had for over 10 years, and I’m raising three kids with my girlfriend. Our oldest was recently diagnosed with Autism, and daycare costs are a heavy load. Plus, we live 10 hours away from family, so it’s just us figuring it out day by day.

Some days, it feels like my tank is running pretty low. Coffee has become a small but important ritual that helps me reset in the mornings. I’ve also started trying running recently—not sure where it’ll go, but it’s been a way to get some space from the stress and keep moving forward, even if just a little.

I don’t have everything figured out, and I’m definitely still learning. But I’m still here, still showing up, and that counts.

# Tooth Enamel Paint 2025: Best Brands & Expert Review

Tooth enamel paint, a relatively new development in cosmetic dentistry, offers a non-invasive way to improve the appearance of teeth. Unlike traditional whitening procedures or veneers, enamel paint provides a temporary solution for discoloration, chips, and other minor imperfections. As we move into 2025, numerous brands are vying for market share, each promising enhanced aesthetics and ease of application. This review will delve into the leading products, dissecting their features, benefits, and drawbacks to help you make an informed decision.

[[Browse top-rated tooth enamel paint on Amazon]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?KW=tooth+enamel+paint)
## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness and appeal of tooth enamel paint hinge on several crucial features. These include the paint's color range, application method, durability, safety profile, and ease of removal. Understanding these factors is essential for anyone considering this cosmetic option.

**Color Matching and Range:** The best tooth enamel paints offer a wide range of shades to match natural tooth colors.

Achieving a natural look requires precise color matching. Top brands provide shade guides and detailed descriptions to help users select the most appropriate color. Some even offer custom blending services to create a truly personalized shade. Poor color matching can result in an artificial or uneven appearance, detracting from the desired aesthetic improvement. Advanced formulas incorporate light-reflecting pigments to mimic the natural translucence of enamel, further enhancing the realistic look.

**Application Method and Ease of Use:** User-friendly application is paramount for achieving professional-looking results at home.

Ideally, tooth enamel paint should be easy to apply with minimal tools and training. Products with fine-tipped brushes or applicator pens allow for precise application, even in hard-to-reach areas. Quick-drying formulas minimize the risk of smudging or running. Clear instructions and video tutorials are also essential for guiding users through the application process. The best products also include tools for tooth preparation, such as cleaning wipes or mild abrasives, to ensure optimal adhesion.

**Durability and Stain Resistance:** Tooth enamel paint needs to withstand daily wear and tear, including eating and drinking.

High-quality enamel paints should resist chipping, fading, and staining for a reasonable period. Some products boast formulas that can last for several days with proper care. Stain resistance is particularly important, as the paint should not absorb pigments from coffee, tea, or other colored foods and beverages. Regular oral hygiene practices, such as gentle brushing and flossing, can help extend the lifespan of the paint and maintain its appearance.

**Safety Profile and Ingredients:** The safety of tooth enamel paint is a primary concern for consumers.

Reputable brands use non-toxic, biocompatible ingredients that are safe for oral use. The paint should be free of harsh chemicals that could irritate the gums or damage the enamel. Products that have been tested and approved by dental professionals offer an added layer of reassurance. Some formulations include fluoride or other enamel-strengthening agents to provide additional benefits. It's crucial to review the ingredient list carefully and consult with a dentist if you have any concerns.

**Ease of Removal:** The paint should be easy to remove without damaging the underlying enamel.

Ideally, tooth enamel paint should be easily removable with a specialized solution or gentle brushing. Products that require harsh chemicals or abrasive methods for removal can damage the enamel and cause sensitivity. The removal process should be quick and painless, leaving the teeth clean and undamaged. Some brands offer pre-treatment solutions that help loosen the paint for easier removal.

## Core Benefits

Tooth enamel paint offers several compelling benefits for individuals seeking a quick and non-invasive way to enhance their smile. These benefits include improved aesthetics, boosted confidence, and affordability compared to more permanent cosmetic procedures.

**Instant Aesthetic Improvement:** Tooth enamel paint provides an immediate transformation, covering stains, chips, and other imperfections.

Users can instantly achieve a brighter, more uniform smile without undergoing lengthy or expensive dental procedures. This can be particularly beneficial for special events, photoshoots, or simply to boost self-esteem. The ability to quickly and easily conceal imperfections can have a significant impact on one's overall appearance and confidence.

**Enhanced Self-Confidence:** A more attractive smile can significantly boost self-confidence and social interactions.

Individuals who are self-conscious about their teeth may find that enamel paint helps them feel more comfortable and confident in social and professional settings. A brighter, more even smile can make a positive first impression and improve overall self-esteem. The ability to control and enhance one's appearance can be empowering and lead to greater personal satisfaction.

**Cost-Effective Alternative:** Compared to veneers or professional whitening, enamel paint is a significantly more affordable option.

Tooth enamel paint offers a budget-friendly way to achieve a cosmetic improvement without the high cost of traditional dental procedures. This makes it accessible to a wider range of consumers who may not be able to afford more permanent solutions. While the results are temporary, the affordability and ease of application make it an attractive option for those seeking a quick and inexpensive smile makeover.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about tooth enamel paint can help potential users make informed decisions. This section covers frequently asked questions regarding safety, application, maintenance, and suitability.

**Is tooth enamel paint safe for my teeth?**

When used as directed, high-quality tooth enamel paint is generally considered safe for teeth. Look for products that are FDA-approved and free of harsh chemicals. However, it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and avoid overuse. Consult with your dentist if you have any concerns or pre-existing dental conditions. Improper application or prolonged use of low-quality products could potentially damage the enamel or irritate the gums.

**How long does tooth enamel paint typically last?**

The longevity of tooth enamel paint varies depending on the brand, formulation, and individual habits. Some products may last for a few hours, while others can last for several days with proper care. Factors such as eating habits, oral hygiene practices, and the type of food and beverages consumed can affect the paint's durability. Regular touch-ups may be necessary to maintain the desired appearance.

**Can I eat and drink normally after applying tooth enamel paint?**

It's generally recommended to avoid eating or drinking for a short period after applying tooth enamel paint to allow it to fully set and dry. Once the paint is dry, you can typically eat and drink normally, but it's best to avoid excessively hard or sticky foods that could damage the paint. Be mindful of staining agents like coffee, tea, and red wine, which may discolor the paint over time.

**How do I remove tooth enamel paint?**

The removal process varies depending on the product. Some enamel paints can be removed with a specialized solution provided by the manufacturer, while others can be removed with gentle brushing and toothpaste. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive methods that could damage the enamel. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for removal and consult with your dentist if you have any difficulties.

[[Explore Top Rated copper apron farmhouse sink on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-products/?kw=copper apron farmhouse sink)

##⁣ Key Features Analysis

The ​Copper Apron Farmhouse Sink offers ‍several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall ⁣performance and user experience.

**Gauge of Copper:** the sink ⁣boasts a 16-gauge copper construction, ensuring extraordinary durability and resistance to dents and scratches.

Sixteen-gauge copper⁤ is significantly⁤ thicker than 18-gauge or ⁢20-gauge copper,​ providing‌ a more robust and long-lasting sink. this thickness helps to distribute weight evenly, preventing warping or bending over time. The ⁣heavier gauge also contributes ‌to a quieter‌ operation,‍ reducing the noise of running water and ‍clattering⁤ dishes.

**Hand-Hammered ​Texture:** The sink's surface features a meticulously hand-hammered texture, ‌adding visual depth and a unique aesthetic appeal.

This texture isn't just ​for looks; it also helps to mask minor scratches and water spots,maintaining the sink's⁢ beauty over time. Each⁣ sink is individually crafted, ensuring that no two sinks are exactly alike.​ The hand-hammering process also strengthens the copper, making it ⁤more resistant to the effects of daily ⁢use.

**Apron Front‍ Design:** The sink sports⁣ a ⁢prominent apron front, extending slightly ⁣beyond ⁣the cabinet face for a distinctive farmhouse look.

The apron front, also known as a farmhouse design, is a hallmark of this​ type of sink.⁢ It ⁤not​ onyl enhances the visual appeal but also offers practical benefits. The extended⁤ front allows for closer access to the sink, reducing ‍strain⁤ on the back and shoulders ‍during tasks like washing dishes or prepping​ food.

**Protective⁣ Coating:** A durable protective coating is applied to the copper, ⁣preventing oxidation and preserving the sink's natural color and luster.

This coating is⁢ crucial for maintaining the sink's appearance, as untreated ⁤copper will naturally develop a patina over time. The⁣ coating creates‍ a barrier against‌ moisture and other environmental factors, preventing the copper from oxidizing and changing color. This ensures that the sink ‍retains ​its original beauty for years to come with minimal maintenance.

**Sound Dampening Pads:** Strategically placed sound dampening‌ pads minimize noise from⁣ dishwashing and garbage disposal use.

These pads ‌are typically attached to ⁤the underside of the sink basin, absorbing‌ vibrations and ‌reducing the sound of water hitting the copper surface. This ⁤feature is⁤ especially ⁣vital in ⁣open-concept kitchens, where noise can easily travel throughout the⁤ space. The ⁣sound dampening pads help to create a more peaceful and enjoyable kitchen ⁤environment.

**Optional Grid Drain:** The⁢ sink is available with​ an optional stainless steel or‌ copper‌ grid drain, designed to prevent large particles ⁣from clogging⁤ the ⁢drain while ⁤complementing the sink's⁤ aesthetic.

Key features⁤ of the Copper Apron ⁢Farmhouse Sink include:

* 16-gauge copper construction
* Hand-hammered​ texture
* Apron‌ front ⁢design
* ​Protective coating
* Sound‍ dampening pads
* Optional grid drain

I don't even know where to start or what to say. I just feel so sad and I'm not exactly sure what is the exact reason for that. I'm just gonna throw everything together and hope that this post makes at least some sense.

For the context of this story it's important to know that I'm (20F) not that sociable of a person. I love hanging out with people and I love partying as that is the only time i can feel completely relaxed, it's just that I have a hard time getting close to others as it's hard for me to open up to someone and I think that makes me look like a cold uninteresting person. I'm a huge anxious overthinker and it stops me from reaching out to people I meet which makes it hard to develop a friendship. I am well aware of those facts yet I can't change despite me feeling like shit because of it. Basically: I love social events and hanging out with friends it's just that I have no close friends.

On the other hand my boyfriend (20M) has plenty of friends. He would hang out with them every second of his time untill he met me. Now he's primarily with me, but they still meet up every now and then which does not bother me. I am well aware that just because I'm having trouble with my social life, I shouldn't force him to abandon his as well. I am happy that he's happy and that's all that matters. But behind all of that I feel so jealous. Every time he leaves with them I feel this huge amount of sadness and jealousy, because I've always longed for that myself. To be someone's first choice to hang out - to be wanted. I try to tell him that it's okay as it is not his fault, and that he should go without having to worry about me. But deep down I still feel hurt and abandoned.

That also brings me up to todays incident. There was this party today and I really wanted to go as I'm currently only rotting in bed and I hate that feeling of uselessness. I called up like the only two people I know that could be there but they both turned me down. I still had hope that maybe I could just go and somehow insert myself in a group of people I kinda know and just be with them. My boyfriend already had plans to go with his single male friends and have fun (he wanted to play the wingman). I don't want to be one of those partners that prevents their bf from seeing their friends so I approved of his plans and didn't want to be in his way at said party (like I still wanted to go, I just wouldn't be with him). But all of this just made me feel like shit. He knows that I have trouble getting friends and that I still love parties yet he didn't want me there as he wouldn't feel free. (He said that he'd feel under pressure if I were there even if we wouldn't be together and that he couldn't relax.) In the end he left me behind at his place where I was feeling sorry for myself while he went out. 

I guess that long story short, there are two problems that bother me.

1. The jealousy - the fact that it's so easy for him to make friends while I feel like a beggar asking someone just to a cup of coffee (as a friend of course). It's just that everytime he leaves with them I feel this flood of sadness knowing it's something I'm unable to have.

2. The fact that he prevented me from going to the event and left me all alone at his house, knowing I felt like shit because I couldn't go. I do think that him taking me with his friends would be unreasonable as I'd feel out of place, but I still think he could have been more reasonable about it and not just straight up prevented me from going, when I feel like this could've been an opporunity for me to meet some new people.

I don't know. I feel like a mess. On one hand I feel like my issues are real and something my bf should have been sensible about but on the other hand I feel like an impostor, like my issues are not that deep and I'm just making it all up in my hand.

Idk I just wanted to vent. Again I hope my post made sense and I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.",1,1754104510.0,venting,1,1.0,False

1mfg4qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mfg4qn/a_town_called_oubliette_part_one/,A Town Called Oubliette Part One,"Looking back, the course of my life irreparably shifted on March 15th with a single card. Between getting fired from the best job I ever landed to the deep snow that suffocated the fun from life for a week, March started off strange. The great white blanket draped everything down to Montgomery. Fortunately, one thing about the Bible Belt is it never stays cold long; we were out of our thermals after a week or so. In the meanwhile, Walmart to Waffle House and everything in between was closed for business until the bridges unfroze. A courtesy a man with no groceries felt rather aggrieved by. 

The college was kind enough to offer an extra-long “spring” break so as to not strongarm students into facing mortal peril just to save a grade. Unfortunately, midterms popcorned around my calendar as far out as Easter to account for the discrepancies with the syllabi. 

I only dreamed of this kind of winter as a kid. White Christmas, the whole shebang. Funny how much the world changes in such a short distance. The impossible becomes the uncommon. The common becomes the rare. From marshes to mountains, gators grow scarce and the air sits different on your skin. The trip from my parents’ driveway to the curb outside my apartment demanded just over eight hours surfing the blacktop, accounting ninety minutes for gas, food, and restrooms if you cannot combine together all three.

Any weekend, especially since I never scheduled a class on Fridays, would suffice to visit; however, much to much filled out my daily loop. Assignments, exams, jobs, friends, parties. Any of the normal grab-bag bargain bin excuse someone living their life too fast would find comfort in pilfering off on a holiday phone-call or text to mom. Some as trivial as past kinship fell by the wayside on the itinerary of a man struggling to balance class with life, and life with class. Until that Monday afternoon. 

That afternoon, a black postcard peaked out between a stack of bills on the refrigerator box I called a coffee table. The post office had damaged the thing in transit. A big crease ran down the center and it looked like it had been tumbled in a mailsack all weekend. Still legible on the face was:

R.J. Landry - Memorial Service Saturday.

I guess I was lucky though. Three years is a long time for no one you know to die, but why did Papaw have to be the first to go? His light shone brightest out of all I have ever met. A great blinding beacon for home calling for us to share a game of dominos or seasoned slice of watermelon while the Saturday morning cartoons rambled on the box. The kind where floppy artists went to town in lieu of voice actors.

Finding a man like Papaw required patience and diligence like finding a blue crawfish. Most people may only meet one or two like him their whole life. Luck favored me enough for him to basically be my surrogate father. The kindest soul anyone would meet forged by the Depression, tempered by General Eisenhower, and annealed by devotion to his God.

He would always make sure my folks had us up and at ‘em, seven sharp on Sundays. We would all pile into his Oldsmobile and help set up for the morning devotionals before service. It was as natural as caterpillars turning into butterflies when Papaw took up the cross after our original pastor passed away. Unending, unerring, unebbing. Three words summarized his love for his brothers and sisters confined to this mortal coil. I could not tell you any of Papaw’s sermons, but he always got fired up for the Lord. Before the benediction, he would always weave in a “if you know that you know that you know” before inviting any and all down the aisle to the pulpit to give their life to the Great Commission. 

I rubbed the postcard, doing my best to flatten it out. I stubbed my toe on a stack of books as I stumbled across my living room to check my calendar. Out of reflex, I uttered a moderate “Ouch.”

“Everything okay?” Stacy called from the kitchen, voice pitched a half-octave higher than usual as she leaned over the steaming pot, wooden spoon tapping the rim.

The question was asked with a particular kind of empathy. You know the kind where you feel the words come from the top of your throat while you speak with your whole face as nothing in the world is currently more important than ascertaining the truth of the situation. With the question came the smell of sweet tomatoes, dried pasta, oregano and the aroma boiling water makes on an electric stove.

“Yeah… I’m fine Stace. These stupid books got in the way of my foot.” I said as I leaned over the stack to circle Saturday.

Stacy poked her head around the corner with a raised brow. She looked me up and down before smiling and returning to working on our supper. We met in Psych 340 after working on a group assignment with just the two of us. A few late nights later we drifted into something she calls “roommate adjacent.”

The drift collapsed the roof of her building. Old construction sometimes just cannot handle an extra train car worth of weight suddenly lumped on overnight. She took the bed and I surrendered myself to the couch.

I walked over to the kitchen, holding up the postcard.

“Found this in the mail. My papaw…” I said, letting the words trail as my arm slackened and the card sagged between my fingers. Anymore required acknowledging he was truly a relic of yesteryear. That if I went home, Papaw would not be there to share in new memories and that I never again would hear his laugh, eat his cooking, and see the smile on his face when he talks to everyone.

Her face softened and she put down the spoon covered in pasta sauce. She gently grabbed the card and surveilled it carefully as if it contained ancient secrets unobtainable unless you searched each square inch for a minute apiece. 

She gently handed the card back, returning her gaze to my eyes like forming an aqueduct between us that allowed extra emotions to flow over instead of drowning me. “You said he—”

“Yeah.”  I said, swallowing and nodding once.

The timer on the stove shattered our moment. She turned and checked the pot before throwing the stiff pasta into the roiling water. 

“You going to go home?” she asked, flicking her wrist to scatter a pinch of salt, quickly looking back to capture my answer.

“But I—”

“Allow me to rephrase. You are going home. You are going to be there for your grandmother and your father. You are gonna eat with them. Mourn with them. You are not gonna act like they don’t exist!” she said, turning to face me fully, one hand on her hip, the other still gripping the spoon like a paintbrush.

“Stace… you don’t understand. It’s complicated.” I said, rubbing the back of my neck as my gaze slid to the floor.

She turned the stove off and grabbed me by the arms. I tensed up. We stood locked together like two stars refusing to fall into each other’s gravity while spiraling to an inevitable end. My eyes flickered between hers and hers remained on mine. I tried to gently pull away but her hands never left my arms.

“It’s not complicated. They love you. Be there for them.”  she said, squeezing once for emphasis timed with the love.

“I can’t. Got a midterm Mon—” I said, the excuse catching in my throat as I looked past her shoulder at the boiling pot.

“Liam, I know you believe your family hates you. You know the only other thing I know about you and your family? You are named after the man that saved your Papaw’s life. I know if you did not show up for his funeral, your Papaw would petition your God to send some messenger down so someone would be there with his son and wife as they grieve."" she said, softening, thumbs rubbing small circles on my sleeves.

“After three years, what am I supposed to say? To do? I deserted them. I robbed them and ran.” I said, my words quickening as I spoke.

“They would embrace you in a heartbeat. First sign of you they would grab their keys and bring you out to eat.”

“I never checked on them. Not on Christmas. Not on birthdays.”

“You know that one place? You always complain nowhere here tastes as good.” She snapped her fingers as she was trying to remember.  “Whatsits… with the country steak.”

“I never called them. Never mailed them. Just shoved all their letters into a box.”

“In the gas station you always rave about. You promised to take me sometime.”

“They can’t love a son like me.”

“You said it’s practically a road hazard with how close it’s to the highway.”

“I don’t deserve them.”

“Nicellies!”

“‘Cellies?”

“‘Cellies.”

“Why’d you have to bring up ‘Cellies. Now I’m hungry.” I said, hand on my stomach as if it had just remembered its job.

“Perfect! Spaghetti’s done. Eat.” she said. Stacy let go of me and turned around, ushering me toward the counter with one hand on my back and one inviting me forward.

Her hands rummaged through my meager plating options before finding two almost presentable plastic plates. Her hip leaned against the counter while she dipped up some noodles and sauce, sprinkling on a minute portion of oregano to garnish. Then, we buried the whole dish with enough romano to collapse a roof.

I sat down with my plate while Stacy began to pick up.

“I forgot how much I like your weird sauce,” I said, half-smiling. “It’s got that… that thing.”

“Red pepper flakes?” she asked, twirling her fork once to build up a decent morsel for a bite.

“No… the little cream in the red sauce.”

“I ever tell you why I do that?” she asked, leaning into the counter again, cradling the plate in one hand.

“No.” I said talking past the pasta in my mouth. “I don’t think so.”

“My brother had a dairy thing. Just a lick of it and he’d be on the toilet. So I grew up: no ice cream, no cheese, no milk. Nothing.”

“That must have been horrible.” I said, setting my plate down, giving her my full attention.

“It was… but Dyl was worth it. Anyways. The cream. Mom had left the stove unattended to take a call in the living room. We had a carton of milk because Dad had grabbed what he swore was orange juice. Mom yelled at him when he brought it home and hit him on the back with a newspaper until he went back to the store to get some o j. Few days later… time to strike. Milk into the pasta. I stirred it in and you couldn’t tell it was off. Momma got off the phone and fixed us dinner. It was delicious. Even Dad was surprised. Dyl licked his plate clean. While he was tearing up the bathroom, I was being tore up by a switch…. Hawthorne branches make for the worst switches.”

I let her memory linger while trying to digest just what I wanted. 

“If I go, and I’m not saying I will, would you go with me?” 

“Of course, idiot. As long as they have a couch for you to sleep on.” she said, bumping my shoulder with hers. 

“They have a couch… at least they did.” 

“Perfect! We’ll pack after class today and leave early Friday.” She jumped out her seat, tossed her plate in the sink and began wiping off the stove top from the red splatter everywhere. 

I leaned back in the chair until the front legs lifted off. I dropped my head back and watched her work in my inverted world. 

“You know I’ll get that. You’re my guest.”

“I made the mess.”

**Knock.**

The sound rang flat in my apartment. A solitary occurrence, solid enough to add a slight echo in the furniture. 

I immediately stood.

“Expecting company?”

“Just you.”

The knock came again, just as firm. 

I walked over, pressing my head against the peephole while doing my best not to disturb any of the clutter on my floor. A man, mid-forties maybe, wearing a dark gray suit that had been recently pressed. A matching hat obscured his eyes from view. He planted himself at my welcome mat like a statue waiting to be disturbed. He held a large, brown leather notebook under one arm, a modern, black service weapon on his hip, and clean, gold metal badge hung from his neck. 

I undid the chain on the door and turned the deadbolt. Before I could introduce myself, he started with the questions.

“Evening. Liam Landry?” He nodded subtly with his chin towards his identification in case I had missed it. 

“Guilty as charged.”

“Don’t joke, son. Detective Reave. Sorry for interrupting. Can I ask you a few things?”

Stacy joined us in the doorway, elbowing her way around me. Her brow furrowed. “What’s this?”

“My apologies, ma’am. I’ve been on this missing persons…. Melanie Garner.” He unfolded his book and rifled through its bowels. 

“My dad always said tables are better for talking than thresholds.” Stacy waved him in.

""That's mighty kind."" He replied, taking off his hat.

We sat down at my small dining table and cleared off dinnerware to make room for him. The detective set down the book spine first and cracked it towards the middle, quickly finding his place. He licked a finger to separate two pages before producing a picture of a young, red-haired girl. 

The lady looked normal, unassuming. The kind of face impossible to stick out in a crowd, let alone recollect after the fact. Everyone has met two or three just like her. The barista at a local coffee joint, that one cheerleader no one remembers from the varsity squad, the teller from two months ago when rent was due. I could no sooner name and describe each of them than tell if or where I ever met this girl.

“Am I suppose’ to know who this is?”  I asked, squinting at the polaroid taped to the page.

“That’s Melanie. You’re in some of her courses.”  the detective said.

I blinked, focusing on the picture again before the detective turned the book back around. He flipped through more pages and his finger gave away where he was reading as he prepared his next move.

“You’re enrolled in…. Psych 340. Melanie too. Second row, near the windows.”

I stared at him. Nothing. Not a clue nor voice. Not even a vague recollection of someone sitting in the corner of my vision.

“She ever talk?” he asked, studying my reaction.

“No. I–” I glanced over my shoulder at Stace. Then back to the officer. “I really don’t know her. At all.”

Reave frowned, more disappointment than convicting. 

“That’s strange, “ he murmured, writing something.

“I don’t remember her. I swear.” 

He nodded once, but the silence lingered further than comfort allowed.

“Green? Frog memorabilia? Nasal laugh?” Reave prompted, ticking the items off with the backside of his pen from a list within his notes.

I shook my head each time. 

“I’m sorry officer… I hope you find her.”  I said, voice low as I sat back in the chair.

“If anything comes back,” he said, tearing off a card and handing it to me, “give me a call. Nothing is too small.” 

The officer stood and collected his work. At the door, he nodded us a goodbye and squeezed back into his navy blue Crown Vic. Stacy closed the door and when she turned back around she had the most confused face I have ever seen. 

“Liam. We worked on a project with her before she stopped coming to class.”

I turned my head quizzically, trying my best to place everything.

“She had a green notebook with those gaudy stickers on it.” She said with a slight quiver in her tone.

“I’m sorry I can’t remember every single person I talk too.”

“You don’t have to get defensive with me.”

“If I could help, I would.”

Stacy shrugged, but I caught the way her fingers rubbed her elbow. The sound of clinking forks and running water filled the air of the kitchen. We stopped thinking about any Melanie and finished up our evening routines. 

I laid on the sofa watching animated programs while Stace showered and followed her skin-care program. When she emerged from the bathroom with charcoal paste smeared all over her, I showered quickly while she stood like a frozen doll trying to not get the stuff all over the apartment. 

After she disappeared into my bedroom, I reclined on the couch, phone in hand, scrolling through group messages half expecting to find that plain face staring back at me. Instead, nothing. Not a single mention. Just the faces I knew, inside jokes I barely laughed at the first time, and a dozen ill-solicited test keys. 

“Tired already?” Stacy asked from the hallway, now in an oversized shirt and no makeup. 

“Just checking things.”

She gave a look, half understanding; the other half exhausted. “Still staying on the couch.”

“Yeah.”

With a nod, she trailed off down the hall, shutting the door gently behind. I laid down on the cushions and stared at the ceiling, the hum of the fridge fading into the distant noise of passing cars. A faraway train rumbled and roared. I pulled the blanket over, phone still glowing beneath the covers. Eventually, I locked the screen and set it on the coffee table. The black card with the words *R.J. Landry Memorial Service Saturday* stared up at me from beside my phone. I turned away from it and closed my eyes.

I was in Dr. Alios’s lecture hall. Except it wasn’t the one on campus. This room was vast. It stretched into shadows that swallowed the ceiling. The lights buzzed like insects. The projector screen was blank, humming white noise. Alone near the front. My notebook lay open in front of me, pages filled with symbols I didn’t recognize. Circles inside triangles. Weird shapes and lines. Names I didn’t recognise. Dr. Alios stood behind the lectern, unmoving.

His suit was rumpled in a way that seemed intentional, like it had always existed in that state. Carved from birth to only form this one expression. His face was calm. Too calm. His lips moved slowly, repeating the same sound.

“Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.”

He said it like an inside joke between children. He reached his hand up to point at the projector, but streams of dust started pouring off his finger tip. His skin dissolved revealing the muscles beneath his index, then his whole hand. Soon every inch of skin and clothing had disintegrated off his body leaving only a red and white mess of lines that oozed crimson with each movement. 

“Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.”

Behind him, the wall began to ripple like heat rising from the blacktop in August. The heat became scorching. Stacy was now beside me. Her skin blistered and popped faster than I could try to shield her.

“Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa. Pa.”

Alios raised both arms like a conductor before an orchestra. Lights lanced across the hall, slicing the empty chairs into pieces. When they passed over me, the room tilted and I saw my body sitting in the seat above me.

I tried to scream but what came out was not my voice. My lungs were filled the the roar of a hundred people singing in unison.

“If you know…”

A whole choir appeared in the empty places of the lecture. They replied in chorus.

“... that you know…”

Dr. Alios raised his hands for the crescendo.

“... that you know.”

“PA.”

I sat bolt upright on the couch, sweat sticking my shirt to me. My heart ran laps inside my chest.

The apartment was quiet. My phone buzzed. 

\[Group Project - PSY340 \] “Where were you sitting, Liam?”

A roar came from outside the door. The choir draped in black robes and wearing twisted faces and long eyes chanted in unison. Dozens of hands reached for me and pulled me over the balcony. I fell onto the curb.

I rolled off the couch and tore the sheet off me. My hair was matted from sweat and I need a new set of clothes. The cool floor felt welcoming. Reassuring. I lay there for a few minutes, letting the early gray creep in through the curtains. 

My fingers fumbled through the cushions pulling my phone from within. I quickly unlocked it and checked my messages. Nothing.

No “Group Project – PSY340.”No *Melanie Garner.* No *“Where were you sitting, Liam?”*

I clocked the messenger and re-opened it. Checked email. Scrolled through spam. Nothing.

Still half on the floor, I pressed my palms into the cold tile, waiting for my pulse to stop treating my neck like a punching bag. My breathing slowed, but the fog in my skull didn’t lift. If anything, it thickened. Like my thoughts were moving underwater. I climbed to my feet and staggered to the sink. Cold water. Splash to the face. Rinse, repeat. My reflection blinked back at me, pale and uncertain, eyes ringed in exhaustion. I couldn’t tell if I’d slept for an hour or ten minutes.

I stood in the bathroom too long, watching my reflection waver in the mirror like it belonged to someone else. I brushed my teeth without toothpaste. Stared at my towel without drying off.

A calendar reminder lit my phone screen. **Psych Lab — 9:30**. I flipped it over on the counter. I needed a change of scenery. 

The air outside nibbled less and less each day since the snow, but still Jack Frost still walked these streets. I grabbed my jacket and slipped out without making a creak. I passed the quad and dorms, almost fully across campus. By the time the sun was fully up, the chill left the air.

Tucked behind the old boiler building past the library, down a flight of dilapidated stairs. My shoes left prints in the thin layer of cigarette ash. Two red bulbs above a reinforced steel door were the only clue this place still had use. 

I stepped into a room with walls holding a copy of every book from the student store over the last hundred years and enough alcohol fumes to match. The furniture assemblage boasted a nice repertoire of Swedish build-it-yourself, heirlooms from old professors, and discount store salvage. 

Behind the bar Reagan waited in suspenders and a collarless shirt, polishing a glass that glistened with the dim light. He looked up.

“Sprite with bitters?”

“Sprite with bitters.”

The bartender leaned in, arms resting on the bar. “You’re grieving.”

“That obvious,” I said, barely louder than the hum of the old icebox behind him.

“Second best place for it,” he replied. “Best if alone.”

“You ever serve a girl with red hair?”

“Plenty.”

“She isn’t too pretty and she isn’t ugly neither….” I called upon the memory of the picture from Reave. “She has a mole, just below the corner of her left eye.”

“You’re not the first to ask,” he said. “Week and a half ago. Girl with short hair, brown coat. Looked like she’d run a hundred miles barefoot.”

My throat dried. He reached under the bar.

From the shadows, he pulled out a small notebook. The journal was dressed in green, worn and bent. A cartoon frog decal on the front, peeling at the edges. The inside corner was dog-eared.

“Your names inside.”

He set it down between us.

I didn’t touch it at first. Just stared.

Then, slowly, I opened the front cover. On the first page: a circle inside a square inside a triangle. On the inside cover in looping green pen: “If you find this, Liam, go home.”

The bartender watched without speaking. Just wiping a glass with the patience of someone who had seen worse things than this.

“This is a joke, right?” I said, laughing too loud. “Did Stacy put you up to this?”

Reagan only gave a slow shake of his head. “I just keep the drinks cold.”

I flipped through the journal’s pages, faster now. Notes. Drawings. Scribbled observations about faces and names I didn’t recognize, all written with the manic precision of someone who had stopped sleeping. One entry was just my name over and over again.

Liam Liam  Liam   Liam    Liam, go home.

“What the hell does that even mean?” I muttered, my voice cracking around the last word.

“You okay?” Reagan asked gently, not moving from behind the bar.

“No,” I snapped, slamming the notebook shut. “No, I’m not okay. I don’t know this girl!”

I shoved my chair back with a screech across the floor and tossed a crumpled twenty onto the counter. “Keep the change.”

I stormed out before he could say another word, the notebook still in my hand, my breath coming in hard, shallow bursts. The cold bit deeper this time, or maybe it was just in my head.

*If you find this, Liam, go home.*

*Go home.*

I broke into a jog. Then a sprint.

Through the quad, past a few early risers giving me side-eyes, across the cracked stone steps behind the dining hall and straight to my dorm. As much as I should talk to Stacy, I would just lash out at her.

I didn’t want to explain this. Not now. Not with my pulse chewing at my temples and the notebook hot in my hand.

I yanked open my duffel and started stuffing in shirts. Jeans. Phone charger. The postcard. The postcard\*\*!\*\* I almost forgot it. I folded it carefully and slipped it into my back pocket like it was armor.

Then I reached under the bed and grabbed the box I hadn’t touched since freshman year. Inside were the family photos Mamaw had sent with me. Ones I’d left face-down in the drawer for years.

The top one was of Papaw and me. I was five. We were in front of the church, and he was holding my hand in both of his.

I stared at it, and for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel angry. Just tired. Tired of pretending I didn’t miss home. 

By the time Stacy texted to ask where I was, I was already halfway down to the parking garage. My fingers drafted several replies before settling on one.

Going home 

Let me drive you Liam.

No

We can take shifts, stop for lunch, find some happiness in the thing. 

You got the paper

Taking shifts means I can do it along the way. Plus, I want to meet your folks.

No

Which level?

Dont

Which level?

I ignored it, reached Level 3B and popped the trunk. The duffel thunked in beside my jumper cables and an old bookbag. I set Melanie’s notebook on the passenger seat.

Liam, 3B or 4A? I’m in the elevator. 

I hit the steering wheel with my palms several times before gripping the wheel tight enough to try and rip it off the steering column. 

3B

Thought so. You like parking next to the crack that looks like Florida.

I glanced at the column beside the parking space. The crack did look like Florida. 

She stepped out the stairwell with a backpack and two coffees. She walked up beside my window and knocked once. 

I lowered it an inch. “Stace…”

“Half-sugar. Drink it.”

“I said no.”

“I hear you, but I decline.” she said calmly.

I said “If you come, I drive first. No stopping before the state line.”

“Sure.”

We pulled out into the gray afternoon, concrete pillars flashing by like metronomes.

We merged onto the highway. The lines stitched forward. I let my head fall back and breathed. After a few miles, the coffee cooled in my hands and the knot between my shoulders loosened a fraction.

At mile 31, she reached for the dial. “Gospel, classic rock, or public radio?”

“Gospel,” I said before I could overthink it.

A choir rose soft through the speakers, all low harmony.

“One question,” she said. “And I promise it’s small.”

“Fine.”

“When we get there… do I call him *Papaw* too, or is that just for you?”

-20s F
-5'6
-140lbs

-I walk+run an average: 6.8 miles a day
-Bouldering: 1-3 hours, 2x a week
-Weights: 1-2 hours 3-5x a week (if it matters I'm more of a power lifter, not sure if that effects how many calories I burn)

My activity stats are normal. I'm just extremely active so that will stay constant regardless, but I started a calorie deficit of ~680 calories where I'm eating sn average of ~1,450 calories a day. 

Average nutrition:
-144g carbs
-50g fat
-91g protein
-34g sugar

Im a pretty picky eater so my diet is literally:
-breakfast:oatmeal or just coffee with no food
-lunch: mini steak tacos
-dinner: more tacos with a fruit whey protein shake

Only ""bad"" thing i consume is like... and 5oz glass of wine. But that's just stress management 

I know like ~1600 is normal for weight loss but considering how active I am im not sure if that's overdoing it. 

My weight loss is more for aesthetic reasons than health. I'm already pretty lean/toned and people usually assume I'm like 100lbs, my 140 is largely muscle and not fat.  I just want to look leaner especially in my legs since my fat is literally all in my thighs and ass.  I dont think i can go below 130lbs without losing healthy muscle.

I don't even know where to start or what to say. I just feel so sad and I'm not exactly sure what is the exact reason for that. I'm just gonna throw everything together and hope that this post makes at least some sense.

For the context of this story it's important to know that I'm (20F) not that sociable of a person. I love hanging out with people and I love partying as that is the only time i can feel completely relaxed, it's just that I have a hard time getting close to others as it's hard for me to open up to someone and I think that makes me look like a cold uninteresting person. I'm a huge anxious overthinker and it stops me from reaching out to people I meet which makes it hard to develop a friendship. I am well aware of those facts yet I can't change despite me feeling like shit because of it. Basically: I love social events and hanging out with friends it's just that I have no close friends.

On the other hand my boyfriend (20M) has plenty of friends. He would hang out with them every second of his time untill he met me. Now he's primarily with me, but they still meet up every now and then which does not bother me. I am well aware that just because I'm having trouble with my social life, I shouldn't force him to abandon his as well. I am happy that he's happy and that's all that matters. But behind all of that I feel so jealous. Every time he leaves with them I feel this huge amount of sadness and jealousy, because I've always longed for that myself. To be someone's first choice to hang out - to be wanted. I try to tell him that it's okay as it is not his fault, and that he should go without having to worry about me. But deep down I still feel hurt and abandoned.

That also brings me up to todays incident. There was this party today and I really wanted to go as I'm currently only rotting in bed and I hate that feeling of uselessness. I called up like the only two people I know that could be there but they both turned me down. I still had hope that maybe I could just go and somehow insert myself in a group of people I kinda know and just be with them. My boyfriend already had plans to go with his single male friends and have fun (he wanted to play the wingman). I don't want to be one of those partners that prevents their bf from seeing their friends so I approved of his plans and didn't want to be in his way at said party (like I still wanted to go, I just wouldn't be with him). But all of this just made me feel like shit. He knows that I have trouble getting friends and that I still love parties yet he didn't want me there as he wouldn't feel free. (He said that he'd feel under pressure if I were there even if we wouldn't be together and that he couldn't relax.) In the end he left me behind at his place where I was feeling sorry for myself while he went out. 

I guess that long story short, there are two problems that bother me.

1. The jealousy - the fact that it's so easy for him to make friends while I feel like a beggar asking someone just to a cup of coffee (as a friend of course). It's just that everytime he leaves with them I feel this flood of sadness knowing it's something I'm unable to have.

2. The fact that he prevented me from going to the event and left me all alone at his house, knowing I felt like shit because I couldn't go. I do think that him taking me with his friends would be unreasonable as I'd feel out of place, but I still think he could have been more reasonable about it and not just straight up prevented me from going, when I feel like this could've been an opporunity for me to meet some new people.

I don't know. I feel like a mess. On one hand I feel like my issues are real and something my bf should have been sensible about but on the other hand I feel like an impostor, like my issues are not that deep and I'm just making it all up in my hand.

Idk I just wanted to vent. Again I hope my post made sense and I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.",1,1754104294.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I was so awkward and nervous asking you for your number. But you were too and it was adorable.

We went for our first photography walk around the neighborhood. We saw hummingbirds and you taught me about the snails with the brain parasite. You also really opened up to me for the first time. I had already noticed your beautiful eyes, but for the first time, I felt I was looking \*into\* them.

I was once rather silly about not realizing how loud I was in the dog park so early. I felt a little embarrassed until I later learned it made you kick your feet.

You came to my aid, on the roof, when I was broken down to my lowest.

You were having one of those moments & needed space to feel all your feelings. You sat across from me on the other side of the sectional. You looked at me and asked if you could set next to me, because you just wanted to feel closer to me. We locked eyes & as I said ""of course you can sit next to me"", my heart skipped a beat. You just so naturally feel into my arms, and then we shared our first kiss.

The special connection you have with my little woowoo.

We took our cameras to the park to see all their fancy Christmas decorations at night. The little coyote startled you causing you to spill your coffee all over your camera. You started to panic but I quickly put my hands on your shoulder, looked into your eyes, comforted you that it would be okay because I had my camera cleaning stuff with me and I'd ensure it was clean and good. Your distress calmed and you said no one else had been able to do that for your before.

The time you first told me I was uncanny. Or when I picked you up and carried you to bed.

All those times we shared that special dark chocolate hot cocoa. And we'd share a quart of ice cream by simply eating out of it together with two spoons.

You provided me a holiday sanctuary. That week with you was easily my best week of the year.

The evenings we laid on my couch to watch a movie you hadn't heard of before.

All times one of us would text each other right as the other one was picking up their phone to text.

... Because I remember. I'll never forget any of these moments with you, my best friend, and love.",4,1754104270.0,readthatagain,5,1.0,False

However, narealize ko na siguro people here are just always on guard, kaya na misinterpret ko as masungit. 

Kanina, naghahanap ako ng grocery store and nagtanong tanong ako sa tapat ng UMC. The man I approached was so kind to the extent na pumara siya ng jeep for me and told me how to get to Walter. Sinabihan pa niya yung jeepney driver kung saan ako ibaba. Nakinig si kuya driver and dropped me off near the overpass. Mag ingat daw ako. Then narealize ko wala akong cash, buti nalang may tindahan nearby na nag ca-cash out. The lady was so kind and asked me if taga rito ba ako and kung kamusta raw stay ko so far. I really appreciated this gesture kasi wala naman pake mga tao sa Maynila HAHA. Anyways, pagka taas ko ng overpass I asked a student saan papunta Waltermart and she said she's going there rin. So talagang pinasabay niya ako papunta Walter and we talked for a bit pa. After groceries, nag ask ako sa Pickup coffee barista kung ano sasakyan pabalik UMC and nageffort pa talaga siya samahan ako sa sakayan kahit ang lapit lang naman. Tapos I just got added to our school GC and all of my classmates were so nice. I immediately clicked with everyone. Tomorrow, I'll meet up with some of them para tumambay. Samantalang first day of college ko in Manila literally isang sem ako walang friend kasi I guess I'm not interesting enough lol.

About every week, I put out a blast for new friendlies around the way to join me for a Sunday morning meetup at the park. I'm Brooklyn-born, a stay-home dad to a near-2 year old, third generation Latin-American, aspiring fiction writer. I like Bernie Sanders and Robert Reich, basically old dudes still trying to school us on what's possible for the middle class. And I believe that local gatherings are a way to better understand my community, to fortify norms of good will during challenging times, and to work toward change when issues facing our borough demand it. People talking and interpreting events together, away from political forces and labels just seems wholesome to me. It's a relatively new social experiment for me and I'm looking for another 8-10 folks to join me to complete a solid dozen or so. It's inclusive; left, right, whatever. In fact I think the zero-sum games playing out in our government are sort of getting past the issue that solutions need to be felt by everyday people who need them the most. 

Regardless, I like listening to ideas and I want to know more about the people here (after 7 years of minding my own business in this area, I grew up not far in Midwood). We may end up philosophizing about all sorts of thing, or just generally talking about the weather. Making friends as an adult can be tricky, and algorithms don't help much.

It's not a huge investment of time. I'm there for a couple laps, maybe we get a coffee before or after. Or not, folks got places to be and I prefer keeping the ask light, but consistent.  With original flair, I call this project ""the walk."" There's also a discord for folks who want to hang out but can't make the trip.

Possible long term outcomes: a book club, group volunteering for the marine park alliance or local community patrol, an electoral workgroup or canvassing for local issues, team fitness training, field trips, etc. The greatest among them is generally feeling like we know our neighbors a bit better and feel more locally connected. But short term, it's super chill. Just everyday people talking seriously about nothing, like Seinfeld.

About a year and a half ago, due to medical reasons, I no longer can have caffeine. Mostly I don't mind it because I'm not a coffee person and most of my favorite sodas are caffeine free anyway (I like fruity stuff like sprite, grape, ext.) Anyway, the thing I miss the most is iced tea. I have tried to make my own at home but it is never the same. I have tried to get the Diet Caffeine Free Tea and I hate it because the artificial sweeteners don't sit with me well.

Does anyone know of any Caffeine Free but NOT DIET iced tea that you can buy in store? I've looked at everything from Arizona to Turkey Hill to so many store brands. I only have ever found one, ""Rutter's Southern Brewed Sweet Tea"" which is not diet and states it has ""less than 1 mg of caffeine per serving"", which is basically no caffeine. I live nowhere near a Rutters and I have found no way to buy that online and have it shipped to me.

Has anyone else ever found this type of tea? Specifically something I can buy online and have shipped to me? Again, I'm not looking for making tea at home or anything, I want to buy bottles / gallons of tea.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!",0,1754102788.0,tea,4,0.5,False

Horrified.,"Baby is now 3 months old. I've fallen into a pattern of feeds where I am mostly exclusively breastfeeding, however to make things fair for me, husband gets up with me for the overnight feed (occurs at around 1-3am). Husband feeds the baby a previously pumped bottle of breast milk while I pump. When I pump at this time, I usually receive around 90-120ml (3-4 oz) after 10 minutes of pumping. 

Today husband took baby out with him for coffee and lunch with friends to give me a bit of a break. He took a formula with him to feed baby as he'd be out past the time when baby was due for a feed. I pumped at home after he let me know he'd fed the baby. I only received around 50ml (1.6oz) after 10 minutes of pumping. Does this mean my baby has only been receiving 1.6oz during his feeds during the day?? Do I have low supply during the day? 

This made me think of how baby has been very fussy on the breast lately -- he constantly detaches and reattaches and makes grunting and distressed noises while feeding. I'm worried my supply has been somehow lowered without me realising?",1,1754102605.0,breastfeeding,4,1.0,False

Rooftop gardens flaunt their jungle riots, ivy scaling fire escapes with outlaw grace. Neon arteries ignite at dusk, bleeding ruby and cobalt into the harbor’s obsidian mirror. A saxophonists notes spiral above the gridlock, bending streetlight beams into temporary cathedrals.

Not to my dads loud house filled with empty white walls, screaming kids, my dads angry obnoxious girlfriend that never stops talking, and my isolated bedroom.

But also not to my moms house with my shared bedroom that can never be cleaned. The house that's stained with the memories of my childhood, the time i set my hair aflame, the first time i ever cut myself on my cold bathroom floor, the nights i spent preying god to kill me because i was afraid to turn out like anyone in my family.

I want to go home to what I used to see on the tv growing up.

A home that's filled with warm toned walls and with tons of decorations, but just the perfect amount for it not to be overwhelming or displeasing to the eye.

A home with a bay window and wooden floors all throughout it and a nice long pretty rug that goes from one end of the hall to another.

A home with a kitchen that has yellow walls and a nice clean tile floor with a rug in front of the sink so that any water that might be spilled is absorbed.

A home with a dining room that always has the smell of vanilla and fresh baked goods, a rectangular dining table that has a checkered tablecloth laid over it and and a vase of fresh flowers in the middle. 

A home with a living room that has a gorgeous big couch and lots of comfortable blankets, a coffee table that has a stack of coasters in the corner of it for when someone has a drink.

A home with a big backyard that's covered in perfect green grass, garden beds with gorgeous homegrown produce , and a colorful hammock that lays underneath the shade of a tree.

A home filled with bright smiles and laughter. 

I want to go home..

We see these curated images online – minimalist homes, perfectly styled outfits, elaborate meal prep – and it's easy to believe that intentional living requires a notable investment of time, money, and energy to achieve that ""perfect"" aesthetic.

But true intentionality, to me, is about aligning your daily actions with your values and priorities. It's about making conscious choices, whether that's as simple as taking a few minutes to savor your morning coffee instead of rushing through it, or decluttering a drawer to reduce stress. You can be elegantly intentional with a thrift store find just as easily as with a designer item.

As promised, I am here to share the second act of part one of a three-part Fillmore finally I wrote. As before, please share any comments or opinions you have!

ACT 2: The Ovens of Fear.

*Cut to the detention room. Safety patrol members are checking the room while Jeff sits under a blanket, covered in toilet paper and shivering as Ingrid tries to talk to him. Vallejo slips past the murmuring crowd outside the door, all trying to take pictures and ask questions, and into the detention room, shutting the door.*

Vallejo: Fillmore, what happened?

Fillmore: Our informant just got TP'd like the toothbrush house on halloween.

*Vallejo shakes his head.*

Vallejo: How? He was under our protection.

Fillmore: Someone must’ve slipped in under our nose. That or toilet paper became sentient.

*Vallejo gives Fillmore a tired look when Tahama yells.*

Tahama: Hey! I found something.

*Vallejo and Fillmore look at each other and walk over to Tahama who is standing by a wall. She turns to them as they approach.*

Tahama: Look.

*She presses on the bricks of the wall and they wiggle. Ingrid and Fillmore share a look and begin to pull down the bricks revealing a passageway.*

Vallejo: What is this? A secret passageway to our holding room?

*Fillmore turns on his flashlight and looks inside the passageway. It is small, barely tall enough to crawl through. The passageway is free of dust.*

Ingrid: It must be the remains of an old ventilation shaft. Someone must’ve replaced the bricks with these phony ones.

*As they look at the shaft, Fillmore notices something shoved in the corner. He crouches down and reaches over, grabbing an envelope.*

Fillmore: Disco.

 *Ingrid looks at him.*

Ingrid: What is it?

Fillmore: It’s a letter.

Vallejo: Yeah, we can all see that.

*Ingrid rolls her eyes as Fillmore carefully opens the envelope, pulling out a piece of paper. The paper is covered with letters cut out of magazines. It says REVENGE IS A DISH SERVED COLD, BUT IT’S BEST PREPARED IN THE OVENS OF FEAR. Ingrid rubs her chin.*

Ingrid: What does it mean?

*Fillmore raises an eyebrow.*

Fillmore: Someone is out for revenge.

*Then Jack runs into the room.*Jack, panting: You must hurry, they got another. This time in the cafeteria.

*Ingrid and Fillmore share a concerned glance and run out of the room. Cut to them entering the cafeteria where Safety Patrol Officers are looking for evidence. A broken stand in the center of the room and a brown haired girl is sitting on a table, covered in custard. Safety Patrol members are scouring the scene as Ingrid, Vallejo, Fillmore and Jack enter the room.*

Vallejo: What in the name of the Jolly Green Giant happened here?!

Jack: Someone sabotaged Olivia’s attempt at the largest Custard bowl. Rigged the stand to collapse.

*Vallejo nods and Jack goes back to taking pictures of the crime scene.*

Fillmore: Another one. Two attacks barely minutes from each other. But how?

Vallejo: They planned it out?

Ingrid: Or they have people working with, or for, them.

Fillmore nods, musing to himself: But why these two?

Vallejo nods: That’s the question.

Jack: Hey guys, I found something!

*Vallejo, Fillmore, and Ingrid turn to Jack, who pulls out a note from under the broken remains of the stand.*

Vallejo: What does it say?

Jack: It says “*WALK AWAY, THIS IS NOT YOUR BATTLE. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.”*

*Ingrid motions for Jack to hand her the note, which he does before taking more pictures.*

Vallejo: What do you make of this?

*Ingrid looks at it.*

Ingrid: It appears to be a threat. Whoever it is, it seems they don’t want us to interfere.

Fillmore: Looks like it.

Vallejo: So, you're saying we have a criminal mastermind leaving threats after attacking their victims?

Ingrid:It appears so.

Vallejo: But why? What do they all have in common?

Ingrid: They are all new? John came here a month ago, and Oliva just transferred here.

Jack: They served detention? Olivia was just in yesterday.

Fillmore, rubbed his chin, then stated solemnly: I caught them.

Vallejo jerks, nearly spilling his coffee: Woah, you’re saying this might be a sort of twisted revenge against you?Fillmore: A cat plays with the mouse before eating it.

Ingrid shakes her head: That may be so, but it might also be something else. We don’t know yet.

*Vallejo, sighs, rubbing his temple as he realises he has a long day ahead of him.*

Vallejo: So who will be next?

*Fillmore thinks, then remembers who they caught this morning.*

Fillmore: Gretchen.

Vallejo: Are you sure?

Fillmore: Yes, she has a record.

Ingrid: Wait, I remember. Gretchen moved here a month ago and is currently serving detention…

Fillmore: Cause I caught her this morning.

*Vallejo quickly turns to Fillmore.*

Vallejo: Fillmore, protect Gretchen. Now!

Ingrid: I’ll go check the ventilation shaft.

Fillmore: Radio in if you find anything.

*Cut to Fillmore running through the hall. He rushes into the detention where Gretchen sits looking bored. She looks up, more out of boredom than curosity.*

Gretchen, with a yawn: What ya want now?

Fillmore: You're being targeted, I’m here to keep you safe.

*Gretchen leans back and looks at Fillmore, rolling her eyes.*

Gretchen: I can take care of myself, thank you very much.

FIllmore: It’s not about you, it's about getting the one out for you.

*Gretchen shrugs. Fillmore looks around and then hears a twang. He whips around, catching sight of a balloon racing towards him from a slingshot. He jumps forward and shoves Gretchen out of the way.*

Fillmore: Move!!

*A balloon comes flying at Gretchen but Fillmore jumps in the way. It breaks open, covering him in a dark purple jam. He looks up from the floor to see the assailant running away. Fillmore gives chase.*

Fillmore: X MIDDLE SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL, FREEZE!!

Fillmore then yells in his radio: I got suspect on the move, running towards the gym.

Ingrid: Copy.

*The figure turns and shoves down a pile of boxes. Fillmore jumps over them and the figure runs to the gym. FIllmore follows, slamming open the door to find the assailant climbing out the window. Ingrid runs in from the other gym door and they both run after him. Fillmore reaches the wall first, but as he climbs up, the assailant turns and drops a box of custard at Fillmore. Fillmore jumps back and falls to the ground. Ingrid catches him as they watch the figure get away.* 

Ingrid, as she puts Fillmore on the ground: You good?

Fillmore, standing up: No, I look like the Grimace just had the cafeteria’s tacos. 

Ingrid smiles a bit: You want me to come with you back to headquarters?

Fillmore: No, I got this. Go find out what’s happening in that vent.

Ingrid nods and walks away, laughing quietly: The Grimace after cafeteria tacos, where does he come up with this stuff?

I grew up way below the poverty line and I knew it from a super young age. Pros and cons to that knowledge as a kid for sure - one of the pros being I taught myself to save so I wouldn’t stay poor. I am 29 and have over 200k saved…. Here’s some things that I’ve done: 

Gas light myself into thinking I’m poor

Only subscription is Spotify and I share duo with my dad - I use my brothers tv streaming site. 

Never buy anything that puts me in debt - worked a ton in uni so I’d be able to pay off all my loans when I graduate, both cars I’ve bought with cash (I would have continued driving my first but it got totalled) 

Never order drinks or apps when at a restaurant, always order one of the cheapest meals 

Tip based on service, only tip when being served at a restaurant (not on take out, etc) 

Never buy little treats while out and about unless I have a gift card 

Don’t drink coffee

Never buy drinks at the bar - pre drinking is more fun anyway

I used the university food bank while in uni and ate a lot of soup 

Being okay with being a bit uncomfortable - ex: if it’s raining and I don’t have an umbrella I’ll get wet before buying another umbrella, even if I’m hungry I’ll wait til I get home to eat 

Have never paid for a haircut - mom or friend can cut a straight line 

Don’t spend on things like nails, lashes, etc. 

Bought a $25 dog grooming kit and have been grooming my own dog with it for the last 8 years 

Cash jobs - babysitting in rich neighbourhoods (they tip and have a lot of snacks in the kitchen), tutoring for $60/h in uni was amazing 

Lived in a really crap apartment building after I graduated from uni 

Lived with roommates this past year 

My roommate gets me dog food from her work (people donate it but they don’t use it) 

Almost never buy anything new. Always barter a bit on marketplace purchases (especially furniture) 

I’m a big reader (like 60+ books a year) but have NEVER bought a book new. I can wait for the library’s copy

I have a lot of clothes, but they’re almost all hand me downs or used and up to a decade old. I don’t get rid of clothes so I always feel like I have lots of options and don’t feel like I need to refresh my wardrobe ever 

Rewear clothes until they are actually dirty. Keeps them looking new longer and save on electricity/laundry detergent 

Never buy anything organic or overpriced at the grocery store. Look at grocery flyers every week and price match/shop sales. Only shop at budget grocery stores 

My family no longer does Christmas presents (we’re all adults) but for my boyfriend I’ll shop all year for sales. I bought one of his presents for this year on Boxing Day last year (same goes for birthday/anniversary) 

Think how much a concert is really worth - they are so expensive now and I just find it hard to spend $200+ on one night of music 

Say NO to things other people want me to do if I don’t think it’s worth the money 

Calculate how much I make hourly and when I’m thinking of buying something, calculate how many hours i would have to work for it 

Any time we have food days at work, I take food home for later 

I’m a teacher and there is always pizza leftover from absent kids on pizza day. I take it all home and freeze it

I don’t do this anymore but I used to take TP from doctor’s offices or anywhere that has rolls (not like the giant half ply ones). But only if I’ve paid for something there and I would never take the last one ",0,1754101805.0,povertyfinance,8,0.41,False
