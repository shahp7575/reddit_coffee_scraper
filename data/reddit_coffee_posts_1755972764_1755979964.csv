Would love to hear from locals and tourists on your favorite things to do here that won't break the bank!

I'll be walking on foot + public transit. I love cute cafes, bookstores, street shops, desserts, marina piers, coffee, and looking at the ocean.

I haven't decided yet whether to go on a Sunday or a weekday. What's your suggestion a good day? I don't want to end up going and finding cafes closed on a specific day (happened once to me on another trip, what a bummer and waste of transit fare).

I've been sifting through other Redditor's posts and the Bowen Island tourist website but a lot of the stuff people do are quite athletic which frumpy ol' me can't do. I'd like to hear from tourists or locals' experience on:

\* your favorite cheap eats at cafes or coffee shops

\* your favorite venues (artsy or bookish is right up my alley)

\* your favorite beautiful stores (I can't afford but I like to look)

\* your favorite scenic nature spots (easy to walk to, please)

\* your favorite EASY walks  (no off-beat trails or mountains b/c I'm very out of shape and if I get hurt, I'm all alone and nobody can help me)

\* anything free or cheap (I can't afford kayaking, spas or fine dining)

I always find stuff that will look great on a touristy website, but then I find that I can't do a lot of their suggestions! eg. Paddleboarding, kayaking, cycling, boating, fishing, or spa because I'm too poor or too horrendously unathletic, haha. Hoping someone will give me some insights or an interesting hidden gem experience on free or cheap ideas!",1,1755979775.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

1mybmm9,https://v.redd.it/skdf53s7ttkf1,Throwback to 2016 and the home of golf,"Long story short, I was visiting Scotland in a combined birthday trip and we of course ended up up at the home of golf. Didn‚Äôt bring my clubs, and honestly had no plans of playing. BUT, I did pack rains and shoes, so I must have had some hidden hope. 
Anyway, stayed at the hotel on the 17th, and I asked about the possibility of playing, no good news came from doing that other than the usual, go to starter house at 3 am and hope for the best. 
The morning after me and my SA walk from the hotel into the city to have a look around and walked beside a member of the RA who was going to play a shotgun with the RnA that morning. And as all the other members of that club I‚Äôve had the fortune to meet and talk to, he was a gem. I did a cheeky complain that it was to bad that I was there on the one week where it seemed impossible to play, other than with luck. He smiled, looked at me and said, son, I think you have never been more incorrect. 
He then explained that after the members shotgun, no one on this world were allowed to book tee time, not even god himself. So, he thought there was a pretty big chance and told me to wait until 11-ish and then head to the starter house and talk to them, and he expressed how important it was that I brought my beautiful SA, my chances would multiply by doing so. 

The second the clock in town hit 11, I was in the starter house. He told me that yes, in theory the member was correct, but this was The Old Course, nothing is simple there. But, I did as they told me, stayed behind, had some bacon rolls, coffee and what not. At around 12:30 he made eye contact and nodded for me to get over tongue counter. He said, this doesn‚Äôt mean ANYTHING, but we should get you some clubs. 12:45, again the same; this doesn‚Äôt mean ANYTHING but you might wanna go on the green for some practice puts. Then, 12:54-ish he came out to the green and asked, would you be ok to walk the course alone, with a caddie, the caddie will catch up when you‚Äôre on 3rd, if not earlier. 
And an idiot can understand without me saying it; I CAN DO THAT SIR! 

He then gave me permission to go pay the fee, and wished me good luck. 
Turns out, told by my caddie, I was the 3rd person in his career and to his knowledge to ever play The Old Course alone. He had been a caddie for 27 years that day. 

The first other grouping we saw, was on the way back on the 11th or 12th. 

I can, if there is interest, share some more videos and photos. And no, this is not to brag or show off, this is me telling a story i still to this day have trouble believing. 

tldr: lucky and got to play the old lady alone out of pure luck.

Originally I posted this to r/nosleep and I was going to post a second part a little later but then I saw a similar concept doing pretty well around that time. So I decided not to post it anymore. That other guy's story was doing better than mine anyway. So this is a revised version of part 1.}

Something very strange has been happening to me this past couple of weeks. Like the title says, the statue is changing. I've been keeping a journal. I won't go into too much detail here, I'll let my journal tell what happened. I don't care who thinks I'm crazy anymore.

\---

Day 1

I don't know how to start this. I don't even know if I believe my own eyes. I noticed it the other day maybe Wednesday or Thursday. I can't remember which, but I almost didn't see it. Outside of my apartment in the courtyard, there's this statue of man. He has some significance to this town, but I don't remember. It was an innocuous thing I walked by on my way in and out of the building. I just moved here last month and I read the plaque at the base of the statue the day I moved in. I can't remember what it said at all though. One of the founders or some mayor maybe? I DO remember what the statue looked like: it was tall about 15 - 18 feet, it had that aged bronze or brass color with the deep browns that eased into the blackened parts of the crease in the metal, the man himself was older maybe early to mid-fifties, he wore a suit without a tie, and lastly his arms were holding his jacket just below the lapels. That last part is the most important because the other day his arms were in a different spot. They had both moved up to just below the collar.

When I walked by that day, I got a sense I was being watched from above. I shot my eyes up to the windows in my building, but most of the curtains were drawn and the lights were off in the open ones. Then I looked towards the statue. I pass by it every¬†day going to and from wherever; work mostly. Something struck me as being off this time. I first thought that the shadows were off or the morning winter sun was hitting it differently than I was used to. I walked on not giving it too much thought. That evening, as I was coming home and dusk had already given way to night, the spotlight that illuminated the statue from below confirmed my unease from earlier. *His arms*, I thought to myself, *his arms weren't like that before.* I immediately shook the feeling away. *Get it together, Jen. You're just tired.* That's how felt the next day, and by the third I had forgotten about the strange feeling I got from the statue. Or, at least, nearly forgotten.

Today, it changed again. I shrugged it off before, but now I know for sure that I was right. Rather than both hands firmly grasping the lapels just below the collar of the shirt, the left hand held the lapel while the right hand was frozen mid-wave by his head. I must have stared at it for three minutes before stopping someone walking through the courtyard. ""Excuse me,"" I said, ""you live in this building, too, don't you?"" The man looked a little annoyed at first but stopped and said, ""yes, I do."" I gestured to the statue. ""Does anything seem off about the statue today?"" His look turned from annoyance to puzzled. He looked up, ""this old thing? Still looks the same to me. Smug face and all."" He said the last part as he continued his walk. ""Okay, thanks,"" I said after him. I decided to read the plaque again.

>*Alabaster Blackerby*

>*June 5, 1876 - February 17, 1946*

>*""Progress above all.""*

I shook my head and went to work. When I got home today, I started writing this journal. Just so I can keep track of it and organize my thoughts. Who knows, maybe I've been working too hard. Maybe it will never happen again.

¬†

Day 4

Well, it moved again. I feel like my eyes are playing tricks on me. I got up and went to work, but I was running late this morning so I sprinted straight by without thinking. When I got home I remembered to check on the statue's position after I got the feeling of being watched again. His head was tilted down. Instead of looking straight ahead like he had been, he now looked down at the people below him. At this point I don't know how I should feel about it. I know I'm not crazy, I've noticed three different poses it's taken. I don't know if I should contact the authorities or not. What would they say? What would they do?

As I stood there studying the statue again, I asked a woman as she passed by, ""I'm sorry, ma'am, have you got a moment?"" She turned towards me and said, ""yes?"" The word formed a cloud of frost in front of her face. ""I'm sorry,"" I apologized again, ""what do you know about the statue here?"" She turned her head towards it then back. ""Not much more than what's written on the plaque,"" she said pointing to the base. ""And does it seem strange to you?"" I looked at her hoping for a satisfying answer. ""Well,"" she said, ""I always thought it was creepy how it stared down at people. Ever since I moved here, I was felt like I was being watched by it."" Then I asked, ""and how long have you lived here?"" She looked up in contemplation, ""let's see, it'll be six years in February."" I stood there shocked, snow had started to gently fall. Six years? The statue looked different not two days ago... Right? That's what I wrote down. What is going on?

I thanked her and we parted ways. I'm sitting on the window nook as I write this down. I keep looking down at that statue. I started to wonder if it felt my eyes like how I felt it's on me. I'm tired now.

¬†

Day 6

The gentle snow that started last night must have taken a rapid turn into blizzard territory. It is currently 5:43 a.m. and the weather channel says the snow has reached four and a half feet. It is still coming down pretty hard still but not as hard as it must have last night. I looked out the window and saw nothing. Between the dark morning and heavy cloud coverage there wasn't any way to see the statue. After calling my boss and confirming we wouldn't be going in today, I started coffee maker and turned on my computer. If I was going to be up this early I might as well get some work done. Thankfully my job didn't actually require me to clock in at the office. I could do that from anywhere. After pouring a mug, I sat down and got to work.

Next thing I know it's 2:54 p.m. I didn't even eat. The snow officially stopped an hour ago, but the clouds still grey out the sun's rays. As I walked towards the window a deep sense of dread washed over my body. I shivered the feeling away; still I hesitated to look out of the window. I had every right to be creeped out. *No, there's no way that's possible.* The statue was now looking up at my window, hand still raised, waving. I threw the curtains closed and started backing up. ""No. No way. It's just not possible,"" I spoke out loud this time. I almost tripped over my coffee table. I felt like my head was swimming. I sat on the edge of the table for a long time waiting for the explanation to make itself known. After a few minutes I found myself standing and staring back out the window. *The snow.* I just noticed there wasn't a flake of snow anywhere on statue. Not even the concrete base, which was about four foot tall.

I feel like going insane.

¬†

Day 8

I barely got any sleep at all last night. My dreams were filled with a silent and giant adversary that got closer if I blinked or looked away for a millisecond.

The city must have cleared paths last night. I went to the window and saw the snow was pushed away in the roads and even the courtyard. On my walk to work I ran into the same woman from the other day. She smiled as we were approaching each other and I nodded and smiled back. I looked at the statue; it wasn't even trying to be subtle anymore. It was saluting and looking straight ahead. It was dressed in military garb. My dad was a sergeant in the Air Force and the statue's outfit looked identical.

I was so confused. How was the statue moving? Why doesn't anyone else notice the changes? Why me? I called out of work, feigning pneumonia and headed back inside. I wanted to get to the bottom of this mystery. I have decided to write my notes in my journal.

Day 11

I decided to call the authorities on my walk home this evening. The statue (base and all) had moved from the center of the courtyard to directly under my window.

""Maybrook Police Department,"" the man said. ""Hi, my name Jennifer Winslet. I live in the Maybrook Hills Building on 5th Avenue. This is going to sound crazy..."" I hesitated for a moment. ""Go on, Miss Winslet,"" the operator coaxed, ""I doubt we haven't heard it before."" *Wanna bet?*¬†""Well, you see sir, the statue outside the building... keeps moving,"" I said the last part fast. ""I'm sorry, ma'am. You said the statue is moving?"" I heard the disbelief. ""Yes, sir,"" I responded. ""Moving how,"" he asked, ""like by vandals?""

""More like on its own. Changing poses and positions in the courtyard,"" I answered followed by a pause that echoed throughout history but was over in a second. ""Miss Winslet, are you on any medication?"" He doesn't believe me. Of course he doesn't. ""No, I'm not,"" I answered. ""Using any illicit substances, such as; heroin or methamphetamine?"" I sighed heavily, ""no, I'm not. And I'm not drunk either. I know how it sounds. I-"" He cut me off. ""Miss Winslet, if it will make you feel better we'll send over a couple of officers to check it out. Sound good?"" I thanked him and hung up the phone.

I sat by the window and waited for them to pull up. To my surprise, they showed up and got out of the cruiser. I rushed down to meet them at the base. ""Miss Winslet?"" The younger of the two asked as I walked briskly over to them. ""Yes, officer, I was afraid you wouldn't show."" The older one grunted, ""just be thankful it's a slow night."" They looked the statue over haphazardly then they looked back at me. ""Well, ma'am, in my opinion: it's a statue,"" the young one chided. The older one elbowed him. ""What Sargent Burns means is that this is how the statue has always looked since it was built in the '40s. Not an inch out of place.""

¬†I was shocked, ""seriously? Are you positive?"" They looked at each other quizzically and then back to me. ""Miss Winslet, are you new to the area? Your face isn't familiar to me."" I looked over at the older one again. ""Yes, I am,"" I read the embroidery on his jacket, ""Lieutenant Dempsey. I moved in about a month ago.""

He scratched his beard. ""Uh huh. So, you're probably still pretty stressed out, right?""

""Well, I wouldn't-""

""And you're still settling in and probably just starting your new job?""

""Actually-""

""To me it sounds like quite a stressful situation, miss,"" he clapped his hand down on the sergeant's shoulder. ""Sounds like the ideal recipe for misremembering a silly old statue's pose, eh Burns?""

The man looked over at his superior, ""yes, sir. I'd say it's the perfect situation. Likely to send anyone into hysterics."" I couldn't believe my ears. Hysterics? Stress? They thought I was overreacting and overwhelmed. Lieutenant Dempsey walked over and patted my shoulder. ""Get a good night's rest, Miss Winslet, and stay hydrated. I'm sure you'll feel much better in the morning.""

I thanked them even though I was unsatisfied with their response. I went back to my apartment defeated and a little insulted.

¬†

Day 12

Everything was quiet last night. I decided to spend some time at my friend Jamie‚Äôs house. She lives a few towns over and we‚Äôve been friends since our sophomore year at the university we attended. She was worried about my sudden insistence to visit. She originally assumed I had ‚Äúurgent relationship issues,‚Äù but I told her that wasn‚Äôt it at all. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she heard the seriousness in my tone, ‚Äúthen what‚Äôs up, Jen. I mean of course you can come over, but, like is everything okay?‚Äù Jamie truly was my best friend in the whole world. There wasn‚Äôt a single thing we kept from each other. Up until now I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about my ‚Ä¶ problems.

‚ÄúShit, Jen, that sounds awful.‚Äù I could always count on Jamie to believe me. Unlike myself, Jamie had a certain proclivity towards the supernatural and spiritual. That was one of the few things we differed on. She was much more bombastic than I am, and she was usually the reason we got into crazy situations in college. ""I'll tell you the rest when I get there. I've got it all written down.""

""You better get over here quick,"" she said with her serious tone. ""Okay, I promise I'll be there soon."" We said our goodbyes and I started packing immediately. As I passed the window before I walked out the door I did something that seemed so obvious to do. I snapped a picture of the *WOMAN's* statue in the courtyard. Apparently it not only changed to a totally different person; it also moved back to the center of the courtyard. I took my bags to the Uber and we started down the street. I felt an enormous amount of relief wash over me the further I got from my building. Maybe now I can relax a little bit and figure out what's going on here. I took out my phone and looked for the picture.

""What the...""

""What's that?"" The Uber guy looked back into the rearview mirror.

""N-nothing, sorry,"" I replied. I looked back at the picture or rather lack of picture. The picture was obviously the courtyard but it was as if someone had smudged the lens perfectly to hide the details of the statue. I know for a fact it was focused when I took the shot.

I arrived at Jamie's a couple of hours later, and after getting my stuff inside she wrapped me in a suffocating hug. ""JENNY!"" She let go of me and instantly wanted to get to work. She had been anxiously and furiously doing research and texting me updates on my trip. Now she wanted to hear the full story from the start. ""Can I rest just a little, please? You no this has driving me up the wall the past couple of weeks,"" I looked over at Jamie's disappointed look. ""Plus I'm starving,"" I added smiling and hoping to defuse her rejection before it started. ""Fine,"" she said sternly, ""but you owe me big as soon as we get back."" She grabbed her keys and coat and we walked out the door.

\---

This is where my journal ends. I'm at Jamie's for now. I can always count on her for support. We're devising a plan over pizza now. She suggested I post this for others to read. Everything that's happened feels like a bad dream. It's strange, though. I noticed as we were coming back in; I haven't said anything to Jamie. I might be losing my mind, but I don't remember the church across the street having a statue of the Mother Mary outside.",1,1755979656.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I am currently 30 years old and having dpdr for 15 years, primarily without schizo etc.

I got it as I was 15. I remember that I was in the bus and that I really felt sick, a different kind of sick (vertigo) so I got off and went home. I layed down to my left side, watching the window and then I had a nap. After I woke up because of the sounds of some kids playing I immediately thought: Ah ok I am dreaming but man, this dream feels weird. Then I touched the couch and thought ‚ÄúWait, that is not a dream‚Äù. Maybe it was a anxiety attack or some sort of panic attack, I do not remember it.

I overthought it over and over and really had no clue why I feel like I am looking through a milky window, why my surroundings dropped from 2K Full-HD to a weird 789p not even known by YouTube. Why I caught myself listening to myself as I spoke and thinking ‚ÄúThat voice sounds odd‚Äù. Or looking in the mirror and not seeing myself. It was a hard time as a teen, my grades got worse and I was suspended from school.

Then I talked with my mom (here I was 17/18) and she advised me to see a psychiatrist. I did that (living in Germany) and after some sessions I got my first meds (Risperidon). It was really difficult, I felt like a zombie for 4 months. After that I got Amisulprid, no effect. Then Zeldox which had some positive mood effects but nothing against dpdr. I quit the therapy, started it again, quit it. After 10 years I got the diagnosis DP/DR. My psychiatrist went the route of me having Schizophrenia paired with DP, therefore those meds. As I had my last talk to her she said that I was the one and only person with DP that she encountered in her 25 years of experience. I also tried Escitalopram but no effect either.

I really want to try rTMS but doctors in Germany are really stubborn and only treat depression or nicotine addiction with it. I also have the feeling that they are fearing anything that is not by the book.

What really helped me sometimes was intense sport and working a regulated job but by no means that is not a cure. My symptoms peaked with 17/18, declined a little bit till 20 and stayed relatively prevalent until now. Every other year I seem to phase in to my wish to find a cure for my self, get some roadblocks and then I try it again the next year, maybe.

Now I jumped over my shadow and started supplementing and paired with some exercises that I wanted to share with you. Maybe it can help you also:

  
\-----Supplements----- (started 10 days ago)  
L-Tyrosin (1000mg, in the morning on an empty stomach)  
After that I eat a little bit, then  
L-Theanin (1000mg)  
Zinc  
Magnesium L-Theronat (1000mg)  
Vitamin B-Complex

after work and eating  
Again Magnesium L-Theronat (1000mg)  
Vitamin B-Complex  
Ashwagandha before bed

\-----Exercises-----  
Breathing technique before bed (4 seconds slowly in, 6 seconds slowly out, belly breathing)  
Eye training (specially for Binocular Vision Dysfunction (BVD)), just started it today  
Regular sport, running, boxing...

\-----MISC-----  
I cut coffein consumption completely and rarely, maybe drink a black tea. No more 3-4 coffees a day. Still consuming nicotine though.

So...  
After all those years I sincerly had very short but great moments in the last couple days and I couldnt believe it. These moments occured mainly after coming home, looking at my dinner plate and saying: Wait, wow, whats happening? The food looks so high quality and ""real"", it sent positive shivers through my spine. It also seems that the ""feeling real, here and now"" sometimes tries to fight its way through the fog. Very minimal but if I learned something over all those years then its to be patient. Slowly but gradually I will feel better. I dont except a miracle waking up one day and being cured fully. 

What do you think of this approach? Instead of hoping for one thing that will bring relief I tried to get every miniscule positive effect combining different approaches. And yes, I still remember what feeling normal is like and therefore having experiences this small victories I know that it is going into the right direction.

1mybhie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mybhie/why_am_i_gaining_weight_so_quickly/,Why am I gaining weight so quickly?,"Male, 32yrs, 6'-2""

I'll try to brief with the details, but...

Around 5-6 years ago I started dieting. I kept it simple, cut out the junk and exercised, nothing special, but I was eating around 1700 calories per day. Starting weight was about 340lbs and this brought me down to about 220, where I plateaued for a few months. Seeing no progress despite cutting my calories further to 1500, I switched to the Keto diet. Eating around the same calories, but with approx 120 grams of fat and protein and around 20 carbs, With this, I finally dropped from 220lbs to 180. It may be important to note here that I more or less stopped working out while on Keto because my job kept me active enough to continue losing weight.  
  
From there I decided to have some junk food on Halloween thinking I was fine as long as i controlled how much I ate. Unfortunately, I realized my self control wasn't as strong as I thought, as once i reintroduced sugar into my diet, I had a hard time keeping away from the junk. Like, there were times where I could not sleep at night if i didn't eat a little of what junk I bought first.

This binge, if you want to call it that, lasted about three months, or until the new year when I cut out the junk again. But by then I regained 40lbs, bringing me back up to 220, which was devastating. However, I jumped right back into keto to try and lose it again. Only, this time it wasn't working. 

For the next year, I tried to stay on keto and would lose maybe a pound or two over a couple weeks, but every little mistake I made would cause me to regain it. And when I say ""little mistake,"" I mean little mistake. Like say my goal calories for a day would be 1700 and over the last two weeks I lost 2lbs. If during the third week I ate too many protein bars, or maybe if I had a small fry at mcdonalds and and ate around 2k calories in ONE DAY, all the progress I made over the previous two weeks would be erased and I'd regain the weight. It makes no sense. And I've been keeping track of calories and all that, so I know I wasn't overeating enough to gain weight, maybe enough to not lose weight, but not enough to gain it. And yet, somehow, one tiny mistake made me gain weight. 

Regardless, at the beginning of this year, I tried to do some research into the issue after a couple doctor visits didn't help solve the issue and I've come to the conclusion that eating such a low amount of calories for several years might have messed up my body somehow. Like my body learned to exist on a low calorie diet. If this is the case, IDK how to fix it. 

So, I decided that since losing just wasn't happening, I might as well try to bulk up some since my original plan was to drop down to 180lbs and start bulking. I got back into going to the gym around last November and have been going regularly. I started going at least 4-5 times a week in the beginning, but now only about 3-4 times a week. Usually I spend about 40min to an hour lifting weights, then do about 30min light cardio. Except for cardio only days where I do an hour of light cardio. With this, and again with the mindset of trying to bulk, I started eating 3k calories a day, with at least 220 protein. Over the last few months, I have noticed some somewhat significant muscle gain and so have my friend, which was a surprise as I didn't think it was visible noticeable.  

However, bulking caused more weight gain, some of which was obviously muscle. Knowing this, I tried to keep cool and stick to the plan since it was more or less working.   
  
This brings me to today and why I'm posting. I went on a trip to LA with my friends a couple weeks ago and had some snacks. Again, not a lot. I can detail most of what I ate, since I truthfully didn't eat much that day. The day of, for breakfast I ate a donut and a 110 calorie coffee (not common, just cuz it was a special occasion), for lunch I had a meal bar which was about 400 calories and 30 protein. For dinner I had a large bowl of ramen and for desert, a small piece of cake. IDK the macros for the last two, but that's it. The next day, I ate the snacks I bought and took home, which I can't name since they were asian treats i wanted to try, but they should more or less equate to no more than 3 donuts and three canned coffees of about 130 calories each. Not too too bad, but not great. I compensated by not eating much else and working out. The rest of that week was normal healthy bulking and gym time. 

AND YET, OVER THOSE TWO DAYS AND THE REST OF THE WEEK, I STILL GAINED LIKE 10 F\*\*KING POUNDS! In one week!!! And it's not muscle. I feel fatter. What the hell is going on here? Right now, my plan is to cut back again to around 2k calories, but keep up my gym time. ",1,1755979362.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

u/jeeves_ny, the Internet‚Äôs darling of textile care, has a new detergent testing video and it‚Äôs a shocker. 

https://www.facebook.com/share/r/16yXE4u6r8/

Ariel 2x Power powder, one of the cheapest detergents you can buy at retail, beat the previous champion, Tide Hygienic Clean pods.  

I have to admit, I‚Äôm surprised.  I‚Äôve always seen North American Ariel as a value leader with decent cleaning performance but I would not have expected it to beat every premium product tested. 

There are a couple quirks of NA Ariel that you need to know about.   The first is, it is *highly* perfumed.  There are 68 added fragrance chemicals.    This is because the product was originally developed for people who mostly line dry clothing and thus need a VERY potent fragrance to survive the UV and ozone exposure of line drying.   It is probably responsible for the early-rollout boxes of Tide Clean & Gentle powder made in the same factory for smelling perfumed just by sitting in the same warehouse.  The perfume persists through washing and tumble drying.  

Two, in a front load machine, it is VERY foamy if even slightly overdosed.   It rinses okay, there‚Äôs no problematic ingredients, but without a suds suppressor, it‚Äôs going to foam if there‚Äôs any leftover that isn‚Äôt attached to dirt or oil. 

Third, while it contains subtilisin and lipase (which explains part of the excellent performance),  it doesn‚Äôt have amylase like most other P&G powders, which helps dissolve starchy food stains and grass stains.  So you may want to pretreat those with an enzyme pretreater.  

Fourth, it contains insoluble water softeners and fillers, zeolite and bentonite.    If I were on a septic tank, I would probably avoid these ingredients as they accumulate either in the sludge or by floating out into the drain field.    They‚Äôre well-addressed in sewage treatment and aren‚Äôt environmentally harmful, but they are solids in places you don‚Äôt want insoluble solids.  

If you can work inside these limitations, and consider adding a scoop of an oxygen bleach to improve oxidizable stain removal performance (tomatoes, red wine, grass, coffee and tea), you‚Äôre going to be hard pressed to find a better option at the astonishingly low price point.  The worst price in my local area comes out to 14 cents per load.  The best is closer to 9.

It felt a lot more serious than just a crush or passing attraction. It wasn't based on shared hobbies, mutual friends, or anything like that. It felt deeper than that, like a gravitational pull. We never flirted. It was never banter. It felt much more serious. We only had one class together and that's where it happened and we both knew what was there, in the way you understand when you look at each other. I don't know how else to really describe it.But we both liked each other for years. But then 4 years passed from when we met.

I moved hours away to college because my mom had an addiction and home wasn't safe. He didn't know that's the reason I went. One night I was down for winter break, and he immediately out of nowhere said he'd be very down to see me. I wanted to say yes so badly, but was going back to school the next morning. I told him honestly that I'd love to but I don't live here anymore, I go to school in X city and don't have a car, no transit from home/school either which was all true, and I didn't think I could make it work right now, and I was really sorry. He said no worries but I'm scared he took it as rejection. It wasn't an excuse at all. I just didn't know how to make it work in a way that was fair to both of us and kept both of us safe from my mom who I was still so ashamed of.

It's been 10 years now (I know...) but only now I'm finally able to move back safely. And I still want see him. He was always the only one I really wanted and that's not changed for me. My mom has passed away, I have a career, I've taken care of myself, there's nothing I need or want from him but him. I still want to reach out to him to see if he's at all around and interested in that coffee still. I know that when he asked me it wasn't casual based on our connection not being casual and his guardedness. I know/appreciate what it took for him to reach out that night like he did after 4 years of silence.

But it's been *so* long and his social media is dead - I can see he still goes online but he has changed his profile photo to a cartoon, hasn't posted anything in 10 years, no new photos with anyone, no tagged photos, no relationship updates, etc. I think he stayed in town and didn't pursue post-secondary but I have no real idea. I'm not sure if there's just not much going on with him or if he's just super private now.

The attraction of those societies in which the judgment of women prevails, presents itself as an immense accumulation of ratings, its unit being the single rating upon a scale from one to ten. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a rating.

A woman, say, receives a 6. Another receives an 8. The rating, as such, is an abstraction. No one supposes that her hair, her lips, or her laugh is a number. Yet the 6 and the 8 are treated as commensurable. Whence arises this commensurability?

It cannot be the hair, nor the lips, nor the laugh, for these are qualitatively distinct. And yet, men in the market of dating exchange women as if these numbers were directly comparable. The man discards his 6 in order to obtain an 8, much as the merchant gives up 6 yards of linen for 8 pounds of coffee. The exchange presupposes that both women contain a common substance, measurable and quantitative.

If we strip away the natural endowments, we find beneath them the effort, the application, the time: the labor of beautification. Time spent curling, contouring, dieting, tanning, dressing, learning to smile at precisely the right angle. This is the universal element. It is not the particular attributes, but the expenditure of socially beautiful labor time that renders one woman exchangeable with another in the dating market.

Hotness, then, like value, manifests itself as an exchange ratio. A man may boast: ‚ÄúI left my 7 for a 9.‚Äù What does this mean, except that he exchanged one quantum of socially beautiful labor for another, in the expectation of greater satisfaction? Women become not merely individuals but commodities, their worth expressed not in themselves but in the differential of the ratings they command in circulation.

The ugly woman is merely the one whose labor of beautification falls beneath the prevailing social average. She is marked as a 3 not because she lacks being, but because her effort fails to reach the socially necessary magnitude. By contrast, the beautiful woman achieves surplus hotness: she commands an 8 or 9 not because she is beyond labor, but because her time and effort, when averaged against the standard of her society, yields a higher quotient of attraction.

Thus the mystery of hotness is solved: it is not beauty itself that determines exchange, but socially beautiful labor time that crystallizes in the body and deportment of women, and which men, in their ceaseless hunt for an upgrade, treat as so many commodities to be swapped, discarded, and acquired anew.

1myb9o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1myb9o5/jehovahs_witnesses_revamped/,Jehovah's Witnesses Revamped,"One of the less talked about segments of this year's regional convention is a video that shows a sister drinking coffee with a friend. The friend studied the Bible once but never actually progressed towards baptism. She now has tattoos and a nose piercing. The video shows how the sister stood her ground when the ""worldly"" friend tried to set her up with an old classmate. 

Maybe nobody noticed but a couple of years ago it was unthinkable that a model sister would meet for coffee with a worldly friend. To portray a model sister socializing with a worldly friend from school, with tattoos and piercings is something they did intentionally. The ""worldly"" friend quit her bible study but the sister still kept regular contact with her despite her decision to not become a JW.

This is the new JW. The small changes that keep adding up are transforming the JW in front of our eyes. They can now go to college, have a beard, there is no hour reporting, you can use your conscience to decide about many things and they have a more relaxed dress code now too. There is no judicial committee anymore, you can talk to ""removed"" (instead of disfellowshipped) and minors are not removed anymore. And, according to this video, you can have worldly friends as long as you defend the truth at all times. And I hear there are more changes coming soon.

This might seen like a big transformation but in reality, it is just a cosmetic change. Like the new model of a car that keeps the same engine, parts and mechanisms of the previous model. Just as making a new car more comfortable than the previous version doesn't make it better, these changes dont change much the religion and how it makes people feel.

1myb4xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1myb4xs/does_home_hero_french_press_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does Home Hero French Press Coffee Maker Deliver Perfect Brews? Detailed Review!,"Testing coffee makers is practically a daily ritual for me, and I recently got my hands on the Home Hero HHKA0107 French Press Coffee Maker. This sleek coffee press promises style, durability, and excellent brewing results. The moment I unboxed it, I could see that it was no ordinary appliance‚Äîit carries a certain elegance with its bamboo handle and clear borosilicate glass construction. Although my mornings are fueled by caffeine, this French press brought a touch of aesthetic joy to my kitchen routine, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to put it through its paces.

**Stylish and Modern Design**  
The design of this French press immediately caught my eye. It features a bamboo wood handle that perfectly balances beauty and practicality, while the clear markings for ml/oz on the glass are incredibly useful for precision brewing. I loved the retro-meets-modern vibe it brought to my countertop. The stainless steel accents combined with heat-resistant borosilicate glass give it a premium feel. Every time I used this, I couldn‚Äôt help but admire how much thought went into making it both functional and visually appealing.  

**Brewing Performance and Filter System**  
This is where things became truly impressive. The Home Hero coffee press features a 4-layer filtration system that includes a coiled filter, two fine stainless steel mesh filters, and a metal cross-plate filter. These aren‚Äôt just technical details‚Äîthey actually work wonders while brewing. Over the weeks, I tested this with various coarse-ground beans, and the results were consistent. The coffee was smooth, flavorful, and distinctly free from pesky grounds settling at the bottom of the cup. That robust filtration system truly delivers.  

[Find the best price for Home Hero HHKA0107 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d6b73b4w/)  

**Durability and Materials**  
I‚Äôve handled a number of French presses that feel flimsy or cheap. Not this one! The borosilicate glass is noticeably solid and heat-resistant, while the frame and other components are built with sturdy 304-grade stainless steel. I particularly appreciated the added silicone base. It not only gave the French press a stable footing, preventing any accidental slips, but it also protected my countertops from scratches. It‚Äôs small touches like these that really elevate a product in my book.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve avoided French presses in the past because of their notorious reputation for being a pain to clean. However, this one surprised me. The glass canister is dishwasher-safe, which already simplifies most of the work. The filtration system comes apart easily for quick rinsing. While the bamboo handle and stainless steel frame need to be washed by hand, their finish has stayed pristine after multiple uses. Honestly, cleaning it took less effort than I expected.

**Good Aspects**  
- Elegant and stylish design with bamboo accents.  
- Advanced 4-layer filtration system for a coffee-ground-free experience.  
- Durable borosilicate glass and steel construction.  

**Flaws**  
- Bamboo handle requires hand washing.  
- It‚Äôs slightly heavier than others, which may bother some users.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
French presses are a competitive space, so I compared this one to some of its peers for context. The Bodum Chambord, for example, has been a popular choice for years and offers a similar capacity. However, the Home Hero HHKA0107 easily surpasses in terms of style. The bamboo handle alone makes it stand out. The Espro P3 boasts double-wall glass for better heat retention, but it comes with a significantly higher price tag. While the higher-end products may offer minor advantages, the Home Hero French press holds its own extremely well at its price point.

**Smart Spending**  
When considering its stylish design, exceptional brewing system, and durable build, the Home Hero HHKA0107 French Press Coffee Maker offers excellent value for individuals seeking a practical, premium-looking appliance. Compared to other French presses in its range, it punches above its weight in both performance and aesthetics, making it a worthwhile addition to any coffee lover's kitchen.

My gf who I'll call Sam and I have been dating for a few years now. We live together, and when we decide to buy an item for the house, we share the expenses on said item 50/50. 

Recently, a friend of ours has bought a new ice cream machine, and ever since seeing it, Sam has been asking to get one of our own, while I have been against buying one. First of all, we don't eat ice cream that often, even without the machine; in fact, I know that there is a cup full of ice cream in the freezer right now that has been sitting there unopened for quite some time now. 

That is not the only reason, however, when Sam sees something like this ice cream machine, she always hypes up how she would use it all the time and how this machine could change our lives, etc., but after the initial hype fades, she never looks at it again. The same thing happened when she wanted a new fancy coffee machine, an air fryer, a bread machine, and the list goes on. She convinces me that they would be good to have around, only for them to never be used again. I told her this, and she promised that this time would be different, but that was also what she said about the coffee machine. We are doing very well financially, and the thing costs, when converted to USD, around 500$, which we can definitely afford, but then again, if no one will use it in the end, what's the point? So, AITA for not contributing to buying the machine?",6,1755978526.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.71,False

It wasn‚Äôt just the loss of the person, it was the loss of the version of myself that existed with them. The routines, the inside jokes, the late-night calls‚Ä¶ suddenly all gone. I‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night reaching for my phone, half expecting a message that wasn‚Äôt there. Some days it felt like my chest was physically caving in.

The worst part wasn‚Äôt even the loneliness‚Äîit was the questions I kept asking myself: *Was I not enough? Did I mess everything up? How could they move on so easily when I‚Äôm here breaking apart?* Those thoughts ate me alive for weeks.

But here‚Äôs what I slowly learned: healing isn‚Äôt about pretending it didn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs about accepting that it mattered *a lot*‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly why it hurts so deeply. It‚Äôs about sitting with the pain long enough to let it move through you instead of burying it. And then, little by little, finding reasons to get up again. For me, it started small. Going to the gym, even when I didn‚Äôt feel like it. Journaling the ugliest thoughts just to get them out of my head. Forcing myself to meet a friend for coffee instead of isolating.

It‚Äôs strange, but the pain also forced me to see myself more clearly. I realized I had neglected parts of my life that made me feel alive outside of the relationship. I started painting again, I pushed myself harder in workouts, and I let myself imagine a future that wasn‚Äôt tied to one person. Somewhere along the way, the weight on my chest started to feel lighter.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthere are still days when it stings. Healing is not a straight line. But I‚Äôm not the same broken version of myself I was at the start. I‚Äôm stronger. I‚Äôm learning that heartbreak doesn‚Äôt just destroy you‚Äîit rebuilds you in ways you don‚Äôt see coming.

If you‚Äôre going through something similar, I just want to say you‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs okay to feel like you‚Äôre falling apart. It‚Äôs okay to miss them and still choose to move on. And even if you can‚Äôt see it right now, I promise there *is* a day ahead where it won‚Äôt hurt like this anymore.

And hey, if anyone here needs someone to talk to‚Äîwhether to vent, share your story, or just feel heard‚Äîmy DMs are open. Sometimes strangers understand us better than the people closest to us.",9,1755978496.0,ExNoContact,3,1.0,False

Hey folks, I‚Äôve seen a few ‚Äúwhat should I do in Vancouver‚Äù posts lately, so here‚Äôs a local-friendly roundup of cool things worth checking out if you‚Äôre spending time in the city:

# üå≤ Outdoors & Nature

* **Stanley Park Seawall** ‚Äì rent a bike or just walk it, easily the most scenic loop in the city with mountain + ocean views.
* **Capilano Suspension Bridge** ‚Äì yes it‚Äôs touristy, but the suspension bridge and treetop walk are still a must.
* **Grouse Grind** ‚Äì the classic hike, aka ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs Stairmaster.‚Äù Brutal but rewarding. Take the gondola down if you‚Äôre cooked.
* **Lynn Canyon Park** ‚Äì a free alternative to Capilano with trails, waterfalls, and a suspension bridge.

# üç£ Food & Drink

* **Japadog** ‚Äì weird but iconic, Japanese-style hot dogs with wild toppings.
* **Granville Island Public Market** ‚Äì tons of local food stalls, seafood, and artisan treats.

* Sushi, sushi, sushi ‚Äì you‚Äôll find world-class sushi everywhere here for way cheaper than most cities.

# üèôÔ∏è City Vibes

* **Gastown** ‚Äì cobblestone streets, old architecture, the Steam Clock, and solid bars.
* **Commercial Drive (‚ÄúThe Drive‚Äù)** ‚Äì super eclectic neighborhood, great coffee shops, vintage stores, and Italian food.
* **Kitsilano Beach** ‚Äì chill beach vibes, volleyball, and amazing sunset views of the mountains.

# üé® Culture & Hidden Gems

* **Museum of Anthropology (UBC)** ‚Äì incredible Indigenous art & history (currently under renovations, but still worth checking reopening status).

* **VanDusen Botanical Garden** ‚Äì a peaceful break from the city hustle.
* **Main Street breweries** ‚Äì if you‚Äôre into craft beer, Main Street is stacked with local breweries.

# üåÑ Day Trips (if you‚Äôve got more time)

About 13 yrs ago, early on a Saturday morning, I stopped to get a coffee on my way to work. Coffee shop was in a shopping center. I parked facing the shop. Behind my car was the street like area where the cars drive through. As I was going to/ getting in my car, I saw nobody driving or walking in the parking lot. I began backing out while looking out the rear window. The sun was in my eyes making it harder to see. Suddenly, I see someone in my rear window waving their arms. I stopped the car and came out. There was a woman standing there telling me I hit her. She was wearing shorts and pointed to her leg showing me I had scraped her skin.  She wasn‚Äôt bleeding, but I could see that her skin was lightly scraped. I was totally shocked and so confused as to where she came from. I was horrified that I hit somebody and also that I never saw her until I hit her! I was so upset and flustered that I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly. I apologized profusely and offered for us to exchange numbers . While I was driving to work, I came to my senses and realized I should‚Äôve given her my insurance info instead. I reported it to my insurance and gave them her number.  They told me not to talk to her.  She called me a few days later, left a message that she went to the Dr. because she was in pain, and needed me to pay for it. I didn‚Äôt respond. Sometime later, the insurance company called me. They said they called her, asked her for a statement, and offered to pay for any medical treatment she needed. They said she wanted to speak to me, but they told her that‚Äôs not how it works. She refused to give them a statement and get her medical bills covered. 
I didn‚Äôt hear from her again. I always wonder;  Did she jump behind my car on purpose?  Or did I really did hit her without injuring her (aside form the scrape), but she decided to try and get some money out of it???

Revently I've gone down the rabbithole of looking into buying a robo mop/vac. I live in an apartment, with only one, thin rug under the coffee table. No pets, but might get them in the future. Slightly allergic to dust. I have no budget, the best of the best will do.

For the life of me I can't figure out which robovac to get.

Everyone seems to be giving their opinion on ""the dreame is great"" or ""they love their MaxV"" and promptly 10 guys will reply saying they had to send theirs back.

Watching vacuum war videos, and then checking this subreddit, seems the two are misaligned. The top ranking vacs there like the deebot are hated here.

My problem is:
1. If it has good navigation, it has low suction (saros 10R)
2. If it has good mops then it has bad navigation and obstacle avoidance (the movas, the dreames and the deebots).
3. If it has good all three, then has a high rate of defect/low build quality or bad customer support.
4. If its none of these, then the base station or the robot itself is hard to clean/maintain.


I just want something that will reliably clean my place to a good quality, without needing much maintenance or oversight from me.

After reading countless reviews and watching videos, I've arrived at the conclusion the Saros 10R might be the most balanced overall.

A cold lamp cast its light on my reflection in the mirror of the school restroom. I stood still, frozen like a statue, my palms pressed against the cold porcelain sink. I scanned the familiar lines of my face and figure, searching for anything attractive, but was there really anything beautiful in that plain appearance? When I looked at myself, the first things that stood out were the dark circles under my eyes, so sharply outlined against pale skin, a couple of red blemishes that weren't there last night, and, of course, those stubborn chestnut hairs.

""I feel absolutely disgusting,"" I muttered, letting out a heavy sigh and closing my eyes for a moment to look away from the unpleasant sight before me. All I wanted at that moment was to clench my fist and smash the glass mercilessly ‚Äî the same glass that deceived me day after day, like all the other mirrors out there. This can't be me ‚Äî this has to be some other girl! That's what I told myself, but once again, it didn't work.

""Aurora!.. I‚ÄîI didn't realize you were already here.""  
A familiar voice pulled me out of my trance, making me slowly step back from the sink. My gaze, still as judging as before, shifted from my reflection to my classmate Lia: her stiff, wire-like red hair, a face covered in freckles like confetti, and that simple, wide smile. She stood in the doorway, shifting from foot to foot impatiently as the new school day began. The sight brought a faint, mocking smile to my lips ‚Äî at least one of us was in a good mood today.

""Yeah, I try to come early, you know... to freshen up before class starts.""  
I answered, giving a casual shrug to seem relaxed. My hand gripped the strap of my blue backpack as I headed for the door, joining Lia in the school corridor. The first lesson was about to start any minute now. I'd be lying if I said math was my favorite subject ‚Äî I'd always leaned towards the humanities: literature, foreign languages, and everything that didn't involve numbers or an endless stream of formulas I could never remember. But now I was rushing down the crowded hallway like my life depended on it, with Lia eagerly following toward the classroom. If I'm late‚Äîthere will definitely be trouble. The math teacher is the strictest one here. Sometimes when she fixes someone with her scorching stare, it feels like she could suck out their soul or swallow her unlucky victim whole, like a python.

Luck was with me ‚Äî we walked into the classroom just a minute before the bell rang. At the start of the year, I had picked the best seat ‚Äî an unremarkable desk at the back of the middle row, which made me invisible both to teachers and classmates. It was easier that way: no answering at the board, no remarks, no giving attention. My spot saved me from a lot of trouble, but some things couldn't be avoided ‚Äî like today's test, which, it seemed, had been erased from my memory as something utterly irrelevant.

""Ha... Damn! I'm so not ready.""  
That was the first and only thing I said, staring at the paper with a sour expression, as if it were a slice of lemon daring me to bite into it whole. The older I got, the fewer numbers appeared in the problems. This time, what I saw looked more like a bunch of random symbols from a language I didn't know than a math problem. My despair was interrupted by a muffled giggle from the desk next to me. It was Lia, enjoying the show. No surprise ‚Äî she finished her test in less than ten minutes. She got into this school because of her high grades, after all.

""Give me your notebook, I'll help you figure it out.""  
Lia whispered, leaning in with a mischievous sparkle in her eyes, and before I could say anything, she deftly grabbed my notebook from the desk. I didn't mind ‚Äî I knew she'd handle it better than me. All I had to do was play along, putting on a thoughtful look while my scowl stayed fixed on my empty desk. One of the few things I was actually good at was convincing the math teacher that I understood the subject, that the formulas were inside my head and not just empty wind.

Only two months had passed since the school year began, and by now, we had pulled this trick more than once. It was a fair partnership: Lia helped me with math, and I kept her company, playing the friend she needed after getting into this place. Maybe it would be easier if this school were ordinary, like many others across the country, but it wasn't. I called this place the ""School for privileged kids,"" though its real name sounded far more pompous than my dismissive label. Top-notch teachers, fancy interior, spacious classrooms fully equipped for lessons. And the students matched the pedigree ‚Äî heirs to famous names: politicians' kids, business tycoons' children, even celebrities' offspring. Occasionally, the doors opened for those outside the elite ‚Äî talented athletes, artists, or scholars like Lia. As for me... I'd like to say I have some special skill or that I'm heir to a gold mine owned by my family, but that wouldn't be true. It's both simpler and more complicated ‚Äî I'm part of the tiny percent who got into this school by chance, thanks to luck and my mother's connections ‚Äî a talented lawyer whose client is part of the school administration. I don't know what magic words she used, but I've been here for two months now, despite all my protests and requests to transfer back to an ordinary high school. But has my opinion ever mattered?

I drifted into my thoughts, not even noticing that the lesson had ended. Even that annoying bell didn't sound so bad when it announced the end and not the start of class. I glanced around absentmindedly, watching classmates get up one by one, heading to the teacher's desk with white sheets in their hands. ""Test!"" ‚Äî that dreadful word echoed in my mind, making my eyes widen in panic. But when I looked down, the sheet and the notebook were already on my desk.

""Thanks, Lia.""  
I whispered, feeling relief wash over me. I watched as Lia smoothly got up with a satisfied smile on her face. She said nothing, only flashed her metal braces as her lips spread into that usual wide grin. An unspoken ""you're welcome,"" no doubt.

I hurriedly packed my things into my backpack and followed the others out of the classroom, tossing the finished test onto the teacher's desk. That was it ‚Äî no more math for today! A small reason to be glad, but I learned to be content with little; after all, the worst part of the day was behind me.

The next two lessons went much calmer than the last: the phenomenon of the Egyptian pyramids in history, and a study of the opera ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" in arts class. Yes, such an opera exists. A couple of brave classmates gave in to the teacher's urging and even tried hitting some high notes, but all they managed was to deafen the students sitting close to them ‚Äî including me.

""Ha... You know, I'd bet their singing was way more deadly than the sirens' song that lured sailors to their doom.""  
I muttered, annoyed, snapping my fingers at my earlobe to check my hearing, while my other hand adjusted the strap of my hated backpack to stop it from slipping onto the dusty marble floor.

""Look here! I wouldn't be surprised if a little stream of blood dripped from my ear right now!""  
I added, showing Lia my ear, and my face grew even sourer and more outraged than before.

Instead of sympathy, I only heard her familiar light giggle. She glanced where I pointed out of politeness, but, of course, there was no blood.

""Don't be so dramatic, Aurora! Besides... I think it was hilarious. Who'd have thought we had such talented guys in our class, huh?""  
Lia said with a smile, casually shrugging as we neared the school cafeteria. Once inside, we were greeted by that familiar sight: the same marble floors running through the building. Dreary corporate black-and-gray tones, as if this was not a school but a banquet hall in some business center. A majestic golden crest hung on one wall ‚Äî another reminder of the place's status. High ceilings, big panoramic windows, yet despite the openness, I felt a crushing tightness ‚Äî as if the space was closing in on me, like I was back on stage.

It was hard to breathe. Maybe it was the smell? The stewed vegetables that dominated the air. A peculiar, stomach-twisting scent familiar to anyone who's spent countless days on grueling diets. Or maybe it was the number of judging looks ‚Äî I felt them like physical touches.

If I were modeling for some brand's catalog, it would definitely be mass-market: an unremarkable blue fabric backpack that rustled with every step; a plain gray sweatshirt with worn cuffs; my favorite blue jeans ‚Äî the only piece in my wardrobe that gave my hips some decent shape. On my feet ‚Äî black textile sneakers. And a cheap but reliable watch on my wrist ‚Äî a gift from my father, a reminder of a man I rarely see because of his endless business trips. Nothing unusual, right? Pretty normal clothes for an average teenager. Yes. And I wouldn't have thought about the price of my outfit if I were among those, like me, from a middle-class background, but here in this school... everything was different.

""Look! Look here!""  
An unfamiliar female voice rang out from one of the tables. Though the girl was talking to her friend, who sipped coffee indifferently, the tone made me turn around too.

""See?! What do you think? This dress was made just for me! Under the strict supervision of the fashion house's rep! It's one of a kind.""  
The excited voice went on, drawing the attention of everyone nearby. Her fragile figure twirled, trying to show her friend the work of art draped over her skin. Classic red-and-blue British plaid, a modern cut that emphasized every curve. And, of course, the embroidered logo of the fashion house that made the dress. At first glance ‚Äî unremarkable, but screaming about its likely price.

""Why is that dress so short? If it was custom-made, she could have chosen a length that at least covers her butt when she bends over. What she ended up with looks... vulgar.""  
I muttered, my teeth clenched in irritation or maybe envy. I don't know if I said it to Lia or to myself, but I made sure my complaint stayed quiet, then quickly looked away from the scene to pick something from the cafeteria menu.

""Hmm...""  
Lia said thoughtfully, methodically piling food on her tray, her open gaze still studying the girl. She didn't even try to hide her curiosity.

""You know... I still don't get why this school doesn't have a uniform. Isn't that a thing in schools like this? I think it actually looks pretty good...""  
Lia asked, finishing arranging the plates on her plastic tray, then looked at me with that familiar innocence. Silly girl. Does she really understand nothing? Even if all the students wore the same uniform, social status isn't something matching clothes can hide. Shoes, bags, jewelry, and the simplest thing ‚Äî the car your daddy drove you in. There's always something that screams your social rank louder than you ever could. Even though Lia wore a skirt and vest ordered at the start of the year from the school's atelier, the cheap brown faux-leather shoes gave away her caste.

""Before they placed me here, Mom also asked the administration about uniforms. As far as I know, mandatory uniforms get introduced and repealed every year... It depends on the parent committee. If we had to wear uniforms, how would the students show off their designer clothes, haha?""  
I replied with feigned indifference and a wry smile, gripping my tray, empty despite the abundance of food on the counter. Mentioning my mother brought back something she'd said this morning as I put on my jeans to head out: ""Aurora... Are you okay? Looks like you've put on some weight. Look at how hard it is to button your favorite jeans! Not long ago they were perfect."" Her voice echoed in my head, making me purse my lips and shake my head slightly, as if refusing the food before me. It hurt.

""I don't think I'm hungry today.""  
I said flatly, attempting a soft smile, then stepped away from the counter to make room for others and headed with Lia to our usual corner table. But the sound of familiar footsteps made me stop before we reached the wooden bench. I knew that sound, even among hundreds in the room. It was him. Even before I saw the silhouette, I already knew. My palms grew sweaty, my breath caught. I looked toward the entrance, my lips parting involuntarily in anticipation. I was right.",1,1755977913.0,Bad_Rabbit,0,1.0,False

This is where it all leads the moments that stop pretending, the ones that finally say out loud what‚Äôs been there all along.

**Part IV: Something in Her Eyes**

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything special just a drop-by. A quick hello, some forgotten Tupperware, maybe a laugh in the kitchen. But when Jenny knocked and the door opened, something shifted.

You smiled when you saw her, same as always, the kind of smile that came from somewhere deep and real. But this time‚Ä¶ something was different.

She wasn‚Äôt in a hurry. No quick words, no playful teasing. Just her, standing in the doorway, looking at you like she‚Äôd spent the whole night thinking.

And she had.

You stepped back to let her in, and for a second, she didn‚Äôt move. She looked at you like she could see every layer of what you‚Äôd said the day before not just to her dad, but in the way you‚Äôd stood beside her, held the door for her mom, laughed gently with her little cousin, asked her grandma if she wanted another plate.

Then, slowly, she walked in.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù you said, softly.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she replied and it wasn‚Äôt just a word. It was full. Weighted. Gentle. Like it carried a whole conversation behind it.

She didn‚Äôt head for the kitchen. She didn‚Äôt mention the container. She just stood there, toe to toe with you.

And then she reached forward without a word and straightened the collar of your shirt. Her fingers brushed your neck, and the world paused for just a beat. You didn‚Äôt breathe. You didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI meant to bring your hoodie back,‚Äù she said.

You smiled. ‚ÄúKeep it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wear it till it smells like me,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll give it back. So it can smell like you again.‚Äù

You almost laughed because it was exactly what you‚Äôd said in your head just days before. But the words caught in your throat because the moment felt too big, too delicate.

Then she stepped closer.

You didn‚Äôt know if she was going to hug you or say something more. But she didn‚Äôt need to. She just leaned her head against your chest, right where your heartbeat lived, and let it speak for her.

You wrapped your arms around her, instinctively.

She didn‚Äôt ask for the hug.

You didn‚Äôt hesitate.

And that exhale the one you both had been holding in since the very beginning finally happened.

Right there, in the quiet stillness of a morning that wasn‚Äôt supposed to mean anything.

But it did.

It meant *everything.*

You held her there for a while, not saying anything. You didn‚Äôt need to. Her head rested on your chest, her arms looped loosely around your waist. There was no rush, no expectation. Just warmth. Stillness. *Home.*

Eventually, she tilted her head up to look at you. Her eyes were softer than you‚Äôd ever seen them, like something had settled like a question she hadn‚Äôt even realized she‚Äôd been asking finally had an answer.

‚ÄúYou smell like coffee,‚Äù she whispered.

You smiled. ‚ÄúI made some. Want a cup?‚Äù

She nodded, and you led her to the kitchen, her fingers trailing along your arm before letting go. The silence between you wasn‚Äôt heavy it was comforting. Like you were both slowly stepping into something that had always been waiting.

You poured two mugs. Her favorite creamer was already in your fridge because of course it was. You slid it across the counter without a word, and she smiled.

‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs weird you keep this just for me,‚Äù she said, taking it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird at all,‚Äù you replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours. It belongs here.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer that, not out loud. But her eyes did.

You both took your mugs to the couch. Apollo was already curled up there, tail wagging just once when you both sat down. Jenny tucked her legs under her and leaned into your side like it was the most natural thing in the world. Your arm found its place around her shoulders.

‚ÄúYou were quiet yesterday,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut my dad said you talked to him.‚Äù

You nodded. ‚ÄúHe asked what my intentions were.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you told him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

She looked up at you again. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

You looked back into her eyes, steady and full of that truth you‚Äôd been carrying all this time.

‚ÄúI told him I love you. That I‚Äôm not here to *win* you I‚Äôm here to show up. Day after day. With nothing to prove and everything to give. I told him that if you chose me, I‚Äôd protect you, support you, listen to you, grow with you. That loving you wouldn‚Äôt be a promise it would be a *practice.* And I‚Äôd never stop practicing.‚Äù

Her lips parted just slightly. Her breath caught.

‚ÄúAnd what did he say?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúHe looked at me for a long time. Then he smiled and said, ‚ÄòThen don‚Äôt screw it up.‚Äô‚Äù

She laughed, quietly, and leaned her head back onto your shoulder.

‚ÄúSounds like him,‚Äù she whispered.

The morning stretched on. Light spilled through the blinds. Coffee cooled in untouched mugs.

And you just sat there, side by side, hearts wrapped in quiet clarity.

You didn‚Äôt need her answer right away.

But something in the way she stayed close‚Ä¶ the way her fingers found yours and didn‚Äôt let go‚Ä¶ that was an answer, too.

**Part V: The Words That Found Her First**

It wasn‚Äôt grand. It wasn‚Äôt some candlelit dinner or a walk under the stars or anything that could be posted to Instagram with the caption ‚Äúwe said it.‚Äù

It was simpler than that. Truer than that.

They were home. It was late.

The TV was still on but the episode had ended twenty minutes ago. Jenny was tucked beneath Lucas‚Äôs arm on the couch, their legs tangled under the throw blanket that had become their default. B was nestled on Jenny‚Äôs lap now his little paw resting against Lucas‚Äôs thigh like he belonged to both of them.

Neither of them had spoken for a while. The kind of silence that isn‚Äôt empty it‚Äôs full. Full of comfort, of breath, of unspoken things that didn‚Äôt need to rush.

Jenny shifted slightly, pressing her face a little deeper into his chest.

And then she said it so softly he almost missed it.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

No pause. No warning. No glance to check if the timing was right. It just came out like an exhale. Like it had been waiting on the tip of her tongue for days, maybe weeks, maybe since that first day in the breakroom.

Lucas didn‚Äôt say anything not at first. He blinked slowly, looking down at her, heart thundering in his chest but body still. He wanted to replay it. Wanted to rewind the moment, relive the way her voice cracked just slightly as she said the word *you.*

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt trying to make a moment,‚Äù she said, barely above a whisper, looking up at him now. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been there. And I didn‚Äôt want to keep it in anymore.‚Äù

He still didn‚Äôt speak. He cupped the side of her face and kissed her forehead his lips lingering longer than usual, not just affection but reverence. When he pulled away, there were tears in his eyes.

‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúMore than anything. I think I‚Äôve been waiting my whole life to hear you say that.‚Äù

She smiled through a few tears of her own, burying herself back into his arms.

There were no fireworks. No applause. Just the weight of truth settling between them like a warm blanket.

And in that moment on a quiet night, in a quiet room everything changed.

Not loudly. But completely.

Lucas hadn‚Äôt moved.

His arms were still wrapped around her, but everything inside him had shifted every wall, every wound, every tightly held breath.

He had carried this love like a secret for so long. Not because he was afraid, but because he was careful with her, with her light, with the sacredness of what he felt. It had been building slowly, silently, with every glance, every moment, every memory stored in the quiet places of his heart.

And now finally it had somewhere to land.

He looked at her, not with surprise, but with a reverence so deep it made his chest ache.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever fully understand how long I‚Äôve loved you,‚Äù he said quietly, his voice thick. ‚ÄúHow long I‚Äôve wanted to say it, to hear it. I‚Äôve carried it with me through everything‚Ä¶ the grief, the loneliness, the nights I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd make it through. And even when the world went quiet‚Ä¶ your light was always there.‚Äù

She blinked, eyes glossy again. He didn‚Äôt stop.

‚ÄúThere were nights I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore. Everything around me felt like it was slipping away. But even then your smile, your voice, your kindness it gave me something to hold on to. You were the voice I heard in the hard times, Jenny. The one I clung to when everything else was noise.‚Äù

His thumb brushed a tear from her cheek. ‚ÄúYou saying those words just now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a giant exhale. Like my heart finally got what it‚Äôs been aching for.‚Äù

He paused, then whispered, ‚ÄúYou gave me back my voice without even trying. And now I want to spend the rest of my life making sure yours is never silenced. I want to be your peace the way you‚Äôve been mine.‚Äù

Jenny didn‚Äôt answer with words. She just pressed her forehead to his, her breath mingling with his, her hands pulling him closer like she, too, had been waiting for this maybe not in the same way, but with the same intensity.

The silence returned. But this time, it was different.

It wasn‚Äôt holding things back.

It was holding them together.",1,1755977830.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

This is my current lifestyle: 
I eat eggs and some bread almost everyday. I also drink coffee and I'm trying to cut sugar from it. I eat a dessert or two a week, nothing to big just a choclate bar or a cupcake or smth. I've stopped eating fried food for the past year. I've cut down on carbs but I still eat rice/pasta/noodles with vegetables. I also use half whole milk. I try to use minimal oil in my cooking. I try to her protein from the eggs or sometimes tofu/chicken/fish. I also drink beer nearly weekly and go out to parties and drink. I also eat out every now and then but it's not something big or often. I eat a salad a week as well. 
I have a moderately active lifestyle. I bike 5km daily except weekends. Somedays more. Apart from that I also go to the gym at least once a week and sometimes do yoga or try to go spinning 2 times a week. I'm not consistent with all that but the biking is everyday and I try to do some exercise at least once a week.I walk everywhere as well. But my life is by a desk and I need to be in the computer for around 10-12 hours a day because that's my job.
Right now everything I do is just random that's just how my life is but I want to lose weight. I have the will power and I know I can i just need a plan and know how to do it and what to do.

So I need someone to tell me what I need to change. How can I lose the weight? Tell me everything in need to change in my lifestyle/diet/exercise to achieve my goal. Suggest what I should cut down in my diet and what I should add instead. Tell me how you all did it. I know its not just over once I lose the weight, i need to maintain it or lose more if I need to later.

1myaryt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1myaryt/explore_best_coffee_maker_mr_coffee_sk13rb_and_is/,Explore Best Coffee Maker Mr. Coffee SK13RB and Is It Worth It,"Experiencing daily life with the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB coffee maker has truly been interesting. This 12-cup drip coffee machine brings a mix of simplicity and functionality, tailored for anyone needing an affordable, no-frills solution to their everyday coffee needs. As someone who appreciates utility over unnecessary bells and whistles, I found this a reliable addition to my morning routine. That said, as I spent several weeks thoroughly testing it, there were both highlights and shortcomings worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB felt lightweight, almost featherlight compared to some chunkier alternatives, but it sits steady, thanks to its sturdy design. The sleek black finish, while not groundbreaking, fits effortlessly on my countertop, matching most kitchen themes. I particularly appreciated the minimal yet effective layout of its buttons and the discreet on/off indicator light that keeps brewing simple. One small gripe, however, is that while the plastic used feels durable, it‚Äôs not exactly premium. The coffee maker certainly screams ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù over ‚Äúhigh-end design,"" and for its price range, that's entirely understandable.

**Performance**  
Day-to-day use left me honestly impressed by its consistent performance. The 12-cup brewing capacity is fantastic for family gatherings or fueling my co-workers on team meetings when they come over. The drip coffee maker's brewing speed is reasonable but not lightning fast‚Äîsomewhat where I expected for the price. A standout feature is the Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause functionality. My mornings are hectic; knowing I can steal a quick cup mid-brew without dealing with spills or mess saved me multiple times from showing up coffee-deprived!

[Check Mr. Coffee SK13-RB price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The removable basket filter simplifies everything. Filling it with ground coffee or cleaning up post-brew is entirely hassle-free. I even took the liberty of giving it a rinse regularly‚Äîwhich took seconds. While reusable filters are great for cutting down on disposable waste, I did notice a slight difficulty cleaning finer coffee residues out of the basket over some weeks. Still, I see this being particularly great for anyone who hates fussing over cleanup chores. As for the cord storage? A small touch but such a lifesaver for maintaining that clutter-free counter aesthetic.

**Merits**  
This coffee maker certainly has its share of positive attributes that make it a gem for its category:  
- The 12-cup full brewing capacity ensures enough coffee for households or small office groups.  
- Compact dimensions mean it fits into tighter spaces effortlessly without becoming intrusive.  
- Its Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature adds genuine convenience, especially for coffee drinkers in a rush.  

**Critiques**  
However, there are a few areas of concern to keep in mind:  
- Slightly dated design doesn't wow compared to some trendy, modern coffee makers.  
- The machine works well for standard, pre-ground coffee but not so much for finer specialty blends.  
- Brew speed could feel slow for those juggling very tight schedules.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacking this against similar coffee makers in its price bracket, there‚Äôs a mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks. For instance, the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker offers more luxurious programmability, but it lacks the manual tactile simplicity some users might crave. A similar rival from Hamilton Beach has sturdier materials, yet I've found its larger footprint less practical in compact settings. The Mr. Coffee SK13-RB shines most by keeping things stripped down, no excessive tech clutter‚Äîjust consistent, everyday usability. If sleek interfaces or app-friendly settings aren‚Äôt what you‚Äôre after, this model holds its ground with surprising strength.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When evaluating its price-performance balance, I honestly feel satisfied. For the simplicity it offers, the affordable quality is hard to ignore. Sure, you aren‚Äôt getting the automated bells other premium competitors boast, but do most users truly need that? The coffee here is brewed well without straying into ""basic level terrible‚Äù territory. For budget-minded buyers who stick to routine drip brewing, it‚Äôs safe to say this machine is worth every penny.

I prefer light/medium roast, fruity coffees but willing to experiment. I will roast darker on occasion for my wife who prefers this.

Looking to get started and I am curious what everyone here recommends as a starter setup:
1. Poppery 1 with variable control attachment to adjust heat. I would splice the heat and fan so fan could be on full and only heat is variable control.

Versus

2. SR800 fresh roast

All opinions appreciated. Thanks!!!",0,1755977670.0,roasting,2,0.5,False

1myanig,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1myanig/should_you_buy_the_best_gaming_motherboard/,Should You Buy the Best Gaming Motherboard Gigabyte X870E AORUS,"GIGABYTE X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 ‚Äì that‚Äôs a mouthful of a name for something as sleek and powerful as it is. I‚Äôve been testing this motherboard for several weeks now while building a gaming PC, and let me just say, this bad boy packs a serious punch in more ways than one. But it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that stood out to me about the GIGABYTE X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 is its robust and stylish design. The matte black finish is utterly classy and screams high-end engineering. It‚Äôs an ATX board, so it‚Äôs on the larger side, but if you‚Äôve got the space in your case, it fits like a glove. The EZ-Latch system makes it refreshingly simple to swap out components‚Äîseriously, installing M.2 drives has never been easier. I did it in minutes without fumbling or sweating, even after a coffee-fueled hand tremor. However, one minor gripe is its weight. At 5.04 pounds, it‚Äôs not the lightest motherboard out there, which might make some builds a bit cumbersome.  

**Performance That Packs a Punch**

The performance is where the X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 absolutely shines. This motherboard supports AMD Ryzen 9000, 8000, and 7000 series processors thanks to its AMD AM5 Socket. I tested it with a Ryzen 7900X, and I felt like I‚Äôd unleashed a desktop supernova. Throw DDR5 RAM into the mix‚Äîthis board supports up to four DIMMs with AMD EXPO compatibility‚Äîand the memory speed hits an insane 5600 MHz right out of the gate. Running resource-intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 or multitasking with video editing software had this thing humming like it didn‚Äôt even break a sweat.  

[Check GIGABYTE X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0dgvbm73j/)  

**Advanced Connectivity Options**

This is where the motherboard truly flexes its muscles. Four M.2 slots, PCIe 5.0 support (perfect for next-gen GPUs), dual USB4 ports, front and rear USB-C ports, and even a 2.5GbE LAN. It‚Äôs like someone took Santa‚Äôs list and slapped it onto one product. The PCIe 5.0 slot worked splendidly when I popped my shiny new GPU in‚Äîyou can tell this motherboard is built to future-proof high-performing hardware. As someone who really prioritizes speed and flexibility, the sheer amount of connectivity options feels almost indulgent. But (there‚Äôs always a but), I‚Äôll admit the dual USB4 ports might not justify their inclusion for everyone unless you own high-speed peripherals to actually make use of them.

**Thermal Management and Power Design**

Thermals are a big deal for someone who spends hours gaming or editing, and luckily, the VRM and M.2 Thermal Guard deliver superb heat management. Even during extended stress tests, my CPU and GPU remained cooler than expected. That said, the 16+2+2 power design is a dream for overclocking enthusiasts. I pushed my CPU to its limits, and while my nerves started to fry, the motherboard handled it like a pro. Still, the thermal performance doesn‚Äôt completely erase the need for good airflow in your case, so don‚Äôt skimp on that.

**Positives**  
- **EZ-Latch System:** Tool-free installation saves time and energy.  
- **Future-Proof Features:** PCIe 5.0, DDR5 support, and dual USB4 mean this thing isn‚Äôt going obsolete anytime soon.  
- **Top-notch thermal management:** Keeps components cool even under heavy usage.  

**Limitations**  
- **Weight:** Heavier than some competing models, slightly challenging for compact builds.  
- **Price Point:** High price appeals mainly to enthusiasts or hardcore gamers.  
- **USB4 Relevance:** Limited applicability unless you have high-speed peripherals.  

**Other Options in the Market**

The motherboard market is not short on competition, and it‚Äôs fair to look at what other brands offer. ASUS ROG Strix B650E-E, for instance, gives you comparable DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support but limits you to fewer M.2 slots. MSI MEG X670E Ace offers a similar setup but with more pronounced premium cooling capabilities. Where the X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 really steals the show versus its competitors is the sheer number of connectivity options. If you‚Äôre looking for a battle station motherboard crammed with versatility, this one truly holds an edge.

**Value for Money**

I wouldn‚Äôt call this motherboard a budget-friendly option. The price reflects its spot in the high-performance tier, attracting discerning builders who want cutting-edge tech for gaming, content creation, or a combination of both. It‚Äôs one of those cases where you get what you‚Äôre paying for in terms of raw performance and features. If you‚Äôre someone like me who demands stellar connectivity, overclocking-friendly features, and future-proofing, the investment seems absolutely justified‚Äîthough not everyone will see the same level of benefit.

1myam8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1myam8s/mad_over_menudo/,Mad over menudo,"My husband is mad at me because I didn‚Äôt want to pick up menudo for him. He said he was ‚Äúselfless‚Äù and made me coffee this morning.  I drink my coffee black so this is just a mug and kcup. Picking things up for him is always little stressful for me because it‚Äôs a make sure they give me this and I want an extra that, and he gets mad if it‚Äôs wrong like they didn‚Äôt give him ‚Äúenough‚Äù of something. I‚Äôm also not a morning person and just woke up so no, I‚Äôm in my pjs and I‚Äôm basically a zombie.

It had been a minute so I asked him about his order, he mumbled that he didn‚Äôt call. I said well just call and I‚Äôll pick it up for you. He said, just forget it. My husband has an anger that is palpable in the air. Then I hear him asking someone on the phone if they want to play poker tonight. When he hung up he still didn‚Äôt say anything so I prompted, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre going to play poker tonight?‚Äù He mumbled, yeah and continued what he was doing. I asked him if he was mad at me (because he clearly is) and he said, no. 

On one hand, I think dang, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal I could‚Äôve just picked it up and avoided this scenario. On the other hand, I am like, YOU wanted the menudo and just because I didn‚Äôt want to get it for you, now you‚Äôre mad because you wanted it and you‚Äôre mad at me for not getting it for you.

This is just a simple example of what happens in our marriage. I feel like if he doesn‚Äôt get his way he‚Äôs angry at me and he makes it seem like I don‚Äôt love him or care about him which isn‚Äôt true but I‚Äôm tired of this behavior.

1myalkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1myalkq/does_the_primula_stovetop_coffee_percolator/,Does the Primula Stovetop Coffee Percolator Deliver a Top-Notch Brewing Experience? Review,"**Sturdy and Lightweight Design**  
Testing the Primula TPA-3609 Stovetop Percolator in my kitchen felt like stepping into a retro coffee-making experience with a modern twist. Its aluminum body is as advertised‚Äîlight yet solid enough to handle daily use without feeling flimsy. The finish has a classic silver look that blends seamlessly with most kitchen aesthetics. I noticed the lid fits snugly, and the lipped spout ensures zero spillage while pouring coffee, which is a definite plus for someone like me who tends to multitask while brewing my morning fix. Even after multiple uses, the handle remains cool to the touch thanks to its heat-resistant plastic, and I found this incredibly helpful during long brewing sessions on my stovetop.

**Simple Brewing Process for a Rich Taste**  
Using this coffee maker is almost foolproof, even for those of us who haven‚Äôt mastered the art of fancy coffee machines. You fill the lower chamber with water, add your coffee grounds to the filter basket, and leave it on the stovetop. The brewing process is about as simple as making toast; within minutes, bubbling coffee starts infusing your kitchen with that heavenly aroma. What I really appreciated was how hands-on it felt; watching the coffee bubble up into the clear knob was surprisingly satisfying. Adjusting strength is as easy as pulling it off the heat earlier or leaving it to brew longer, which I tested extensively to get my perfect cup. 

[Grab Primula TPA-3609 now‚ÄîAmazon price check here.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b008n7k9n0/)

**Exceptional Versatility for Different Settings**  
One feature that caught me by surprise was its adaptability to various stovetops‚Äîelectric, ceramic, and gas. I tried it on my gas stove at home and even took it out camping. It also works beautifully over a campfire, something you wouldn‚Äôt expect from a lightweight coffee percolator. There‚Äôs something incredibly nostalgic yet efficient about brewing coffee outdoors this way. My camping crew loved waking up to a fresh pot of coffee, and we all agreed it delivered a fuller, richer flavor compared to some drip coffee makers we‚Äôve used in the past. 

**Benefits**  
- Compact size makes it easy to store or pack for travel.  
- Reusable filter reduces the need for disposables.  
- Delivers a strong, rich coffee flavor.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Slight discoloration of the aluminum over time requires extra cleaning effort.  
- The lid knob design could benefit from a sturdier material, as it feels a tad fragile.  

**Durability Meets Affordability**  
This manual operation coffee maker has no electric parts, meaning there's little to break down, and that adds to its durability. What‚Äôs equally reassuring is how cost-efficient this product is. The fact that you don‚Äôt need pods, paper filters, or electricity makes it a budget-friendly option for regular coffee drinkers like me. I calculated how much I‚Äôd save by skipping specialty coffee shops, and well, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm rethinking my morning caffeine habits!

**Competing Products**  
While testing this model, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to stovetop alternatives like the Bialetti Moka Express. The aluminum build is similar, but one significant advantage of the Primula version is its 9-cup capacity, compared to the smaller options available for a Moka pot. However, the Bialetti felt slightly more polished in design, which may appeal to those prioritizing style. Another contender is the Farberware Classic Stainless Steel Percolator. It‚Äôs heavier, being stainless steel, and while it arguably looks more modern, the weight is a downside for campers. The Primula shines in portability and ease of use, two aspects I highly value. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its price point, the Primula TPA-3609 provides excellent value. There‚Äôs a simplicity to it that guarantees you get exactly what you pay for, no frills or gimmicks. If you regularly make more than one or two cups of coffee, the larger capacity justifies the investment. It‚Äôs especially valuable for outdoor enthusiasts who want to enjoy freshly brewed coffee without depending on electric coffee makers. This brewer feels like a fantastic deal for those of us seeking quality coffee on a budget.

1myajmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Training-Promotion71/comments/1myajmg/the_dream_argument/,The Dream Argument,"There are many versions of the dream argument. For example, D. Odegard renderered Descartes' argument as follows:

*1)* The experiences on which I base my present beliefs about the world are indistinguishable from experiences in some unveridical dreams


*2)* Some beliefs relevantly similar to my present beliefs about the world are false


*3)* My present beliefs about the world might be false.


Since he found that one problematic, he restructured it in a following way:


*1)* My present experiences are source of knowledge of an external world only if I can know I am not dreaming

*2)* I cannot know I am not dreaming.

Therefore,

*3)* It's not the case that my present experiences are source of knowledge of an external world.


B. Stroud defends the first premise by saying that I know that P only if I can know anything I know to be entailed by my knowing that P, and since I know that my knowing that P entails that I am not dreaming, I know that P only if I can know that I am not dreaming. But as Moore pointed out, we can reverse the argument by modus ponens. 

Now, at this point, to block the inversion, we have to argue that the first premise establishes that my knowledge of something external requires independent knowledge of not being in a dream.


The way I want to render the argument is as follows:


*1)* It appears to me that I am sitting in a chair and drinking coffee

*2)* In dreams, it has appeared to me that I was doing the same when, in fact, I was not

*3)* If it has appeared to me that I was doing the same when, in fact, I was not, then I have reason to believe that it is possible that I am now dreaming

*4)* I can be absolutely certain that I am now sitting in a chair and drinking coffee iff I have no reason to believe that it's possible that I am now dreaming.

Therefore,

*5)* I cannot be absolutely certain that I am now sitting in a chair and drinking coffee.",1,1755977134.0,u_Training-Promotion71,0,1.0,False

1myag9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingIvyLeague/comments/1myag9x/please_chance_me_for_cornell_cals/,Please chance me for Cornell CALS,"Demographics: South Asian Male, NY. Highly Competitive School
Major: Animal Science GPA: 97.7% (UW 95.4) 

SAT: 1530

Ranking: N/A

AP: My school is pretty small, so I don‚Äôt have a lot of options. I already took AP World last year and took AP Lang and APUSH this year. Next year, I plan on taking AP Bio, AP Calculus AB, and AP Literature. In all of my classes I have a mid to high 90s average.
AP World: 5
APUSH: 4
AP Lang: 5

Extracurriculars:

Peer Tutoring Club(11) Peer Tutoring Club was created in the middle of my junior year. However, I was one of its founding tutors, mainly helping underclassmen. Next year will be especially important, as I will be tutoring physics, one of the hardest classes in my school, for the upcoming juniors. I will also head study sessions during AP, SAT, and Finals week and run the social media account.

Muslim Student Association (MSA) (9, 10, 11) At MSA, I‚Äôve currently led meetings on multiple different topics as well as Friday prayers on some occasion. Next year, I plan on having more detailed discussions and community outreach. In fact, I plan on basing our meetings on the Cornell MSA. Additionally, I plan on connecting with the MSAs of neighboring schools and setting up a information center during Ramadan.

Newspaper Club (9, 10, 11) At Newspaper Club, I grew from being a photographer in 9th grade, to being a prominent writer in 10th and 11th grade. Additionally, I write for our Newspaper‚Äôs weekly Current Events column. Next year, I will be head of Arts and Entertainment, focusing on expanding the newspaper by introducing videogames/movies/series reviews and revitalizing our comic strip.

Chess Club (9, 10, 11) Despite being one of the worst chess players in the club, I‚Äôm currently the VP of the club. I‚Äôve attended every meeting since 9th grade and helped organize a tournament in the school and neighboring high school. Next year, I plan on introducing Chess with Coffee and making the club more prominent with more frequent school tournaments.

Table Tennis (9, 10, 11) This is one of my proudest achievements as I have been president of the club since 10th grade. I run weekly game sessions and help coach newer players to the game. Additionally, my school has a bi-yearly festival, and at each festival I run the table tennis room, managing a school wide tournament of about 75 people ( my school has 400 kids). I also raised $300 in funds to get a new table single-handedly, and established a weeklong event in building it.

Field Research: At the Bronx Zoo, I performed field research for 6 months. In the summer, I was part of a group project assessing the health of 100+ native and nonnative trees and the pest activity between them. In the fall, I continued the project by assessing the diversity of 1000+ trees in urban parks in NYC and Boston. I presented my findings at two science symposiums. Additionally, I submitted the project as part of the TERRA NYC Science fair and wrote a publishable paper on my research, becoming a preliminary round finalist.

Guide: At the same zoo, I served as a guide for two years. In my sophomore year, I managed activities around the zoo, teaching about 300+ guests daily about different animals, conservation practices, and habitats. I also aided in directions and general zoo knowledge. As a junior, my responsibilities grew to aiding adult volunteers in explaining dinosaurs and their connection to birds in the zoo‚Äôs limited time event.

Tutor/Camp Counselor: I was a tutor and camp counselor at the same program since 9th grade. As a camp counselor, I managed groups of 20+ kids aged between 3rd and 7th grade and led activities such as outdoor sports, arts and crafts, robotics, academics, dance, MMA, etc. I also chaperoned groups of 10 during weekly field trips. As a tutor, I helped kids of all ages, but a majority being middle school and very early high school, teaching general math, general ELA, biology, chemistry, algebra, geometry, and standardized testing to get into high school and private school (SHSAT, ISEE, SAT)

Cornell Pre-College Programs: I took part in a course called Sustainable Animal Husbandry, taught by Dr. Melanie Soberon. The class focused on the ways humans and domesticated animals are intertwined. As such, I learned about the lifecycles of dogs, cats, horses, sheep, goats, dairy/beef cattle, pigs, and lab animals. Additionally, I learned about common diseases associated with each animal and ways to treat them. As my final project, I proposed a sustainable solution to the feral hog problem present in the US by presenting how farmers can use and grow peppers to create a natural deterrent. While doing so, I also highlighted the pros and cons for my solution, as well as alternate ways at solving the problem.

Tufts Pre-College Program: At Tufts Pre-College Program, I gained a great sense of live animal handling. I performed heart and respiration rate of cows and horses, tipped sheep, and performed a clinical initial test on beagles. Additionally, I performed blood draws and intubations of models of both large and small animals. Furthermore, I went behind the scenes in the hospitals of zoos and aquariums.

Awards: 
AP Scholar 
IACUC Certified 
National Merit Scholarship
CollegeBoard National Recognition Program 

Recommendation Letters:
AP Biology/Human Physiology Teacher 9/10
Geometry/Algebra 2 Teacher 9/10
Counselor 9/10
At my school, it‚Äôs really easy to make well-meaning connections with teachers and counselors due to the small class sizes. All my teachers I had for more than 2 years and are advisors to most of the clubs I am leading in the fall.

Essay:
My essay topic is about how getting scratched by my cat led to a change in my understanding of animal behavior and handling. 

Additional Information:
Due to my school‚Äôs small size, AP offerings are limited (approx. 8 total). I have pursued the most rigorous available curriculum and supplemented my academic interests with external research and pre-college coursework. Additionally, age restrictions prevented me from shadowing veterinarians in my state until 18. To supplement this, I participated in the Tufts Pre-College Veterinary Program, where I performed hands-on animal care procedures and shadowed behind-the-scenes in zoo and aquarium hospitals.

Outside of academics, I help care for my grandfather, a diabetic. I assist with his daily insulin administration and accompany him to our local mosque for prayer. This responsibility has taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of service to both family and faith.

His best feats are coffee creamer and battleship and compare it to baku's.

Like the gap is so big its laughable, like in air poker, his mental capacity is great but still the main startegies were by baku and lalo. 

Again in stl, if we don't consider 2sd, only his innate capabilities were helping him to balance it out but we know the answer who still won.

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching. I'm in Brooklyn (can't host, unfortunately), but can easily make my way to you or a place to meetup. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions.

I'd be willing to travel after we talk a bit and you can host. :)

1myadn5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myadn5,I stonewalled and ghosted my best friend after almost 10 years of friendship," Hi Charlotte! After watching so many of your videos and sharing your experiences with ending friendships, I felt confident enough to share mine.  I did share this on a different account that I have lost, so I figured I would repost it. This will be a long one so bear with me.

I (30F) was friends with a gal (38F) for almost 10 years, we will call her Jessica. I met Jessica at a large camping event and we became friends pretty quickly!  I was 20 at the time and still dealing with some shyness and insecurity, while she was very inclusive and outgoing.  For the longest time, I know I was awkward and masked off parts of myself. She was peak feminine with always having her hair and makeup looking amazing and wearing the cutest clothes, while I was more tomboy, tshirts and simple makeup.

She taught me a lot about makeup and helped boost my confidence in myself. And I even got to be a bridesmaid at her wedding a few years ago!  I made more mutual friends during her wedding, namely with the best man, who we will call Bob (he becomes a big part of the story later on).  Around this time, I started seeing more sides of her, the nerdiness, dirty jokes, past party stories, that made me feel more comfortable about opening up about myself!

Things grew at that point! I still had a lingering feeling of closing off some parts of myself around her, but progress was progress!

She and her husband wound up having a baby during the pandemic, and I tried to pop by and say hi when I could. It wasn't very often, but it was moments that meant a lot to me.  And I loved her kiddo! He and I would play all the time when he started getting older and I could come over a bit more often.  

At some point in time, I think towards the spring of 2023, Jessica invited me to join some friends of hers in a weekly game night. This is when things started to shift.  Jessica, our friend Bob, and I would meet up in person, while the other 2 were through video call.  There were times we all got along, and many moments where I felt like a bit of a wallflower and left out of conversation. As Jessica had been friends with the other 2 for many years beforehand in her hometown.

I chalked this up to my insecurities and tried to make more space for myself to be included.  Bob was also helpful in this regard. There was a time in spring of 2024 where I built up my confidence to bring up a topic about our game *the topic specifically I sadly can't remember as this was a couple years ago.  She blew up at me, saying she was doing her best, and she felt attacked and like she wasn't good enough.  It took me totally off guard, and I felt terrible... After some apologies and telling her I needed to take time away from the conversation, I was an anxious wreck.

We did meet up a couple of days later, where she gave me a tearful apology, and we both connected on some fear of confrontation that we shared, and how we could better it next time.

Over the next month or so, we had a few harder conversations, including her struggles with her child, and me opening up about struggling with RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria).  She seems pretty open and thoughtful about the notion and offered to help where she could.  We had another spat sometime later about her not feeling as included in the game we were playing.  I wanted to help and apologized, but she didn't let up and kept saying how she didn't feel good enough and how she felt she could quit and was angry with me.

I never got a full apology after that conversation.  

To speed up this long story a bit, one of her friends back home in our game group moved into town with his family in the summer of 2024. Let's call this friend Jeff. He and his family were super kind to me and my husband (30M).

This is where the energy in the story makes a dramatic shift, because Bob and I started noticing, different behaviors between Jessica and Jeff... Very touchy feely and forgetting to include the rest of us in conversation.  Bob eventually had enough and needed to step away.  During our next game session, Jessica, Jeff and myself were at my place, where I felt like such a third wheel. They were basically flirting, showing off workout progress (and I mean SHOWING OFF if you know what I mean üò≥) he gave her a foot/leg massage part of the way in and were giving each other looks that you would usually give your spouse.

I was so wildly uncomfortable and felt borderline sick after they left, and I reached out to Bob immediately.  I needed to know that I wasn't just overreacting or the only one feeling uncomfortable.  Bob and I met up for coffee, where he too mentioned his discomfort and was LIVID after hearing my side of the story.  Bob was best friends with Jessica's husband, and knew he should be updated on this weird situation.  I also took time to check in with our other online gaming friend who we will call Riley. Riley also admitted to feeling quite uncomfortable with the whole situation.

Shit hit the fan.  Jessica's husband was obviously not happy, and tried talking with her about it. To which afterwards, she called me.  She had her calm voice on, but basically told me I was blowing things out of proportion, that I in the wrong for not talking to her first, going behind her back, saying she felt sorry that I didn't have close friendships like she had. To crying and saying how different her life was now having a kid and how she loves and trusted me and how she wished I felt the same in turn.

I couldn't speak... There was so much I wanted to say, but nothing came out.  Could I have directly talked to her about this? Sure.  There was many things I could have done differently in this scenario.  I felt like I wasn't going to come out feeling good regardless...

I took a step away from the whole thing for a month, and eventually decided to leave the gaming group. I gained clarity and took time to reflect.  I don't feel bad for going to Bob first to gain insight, and I don't feel like I should have just let things go.  In November 2024, she tried reaching out to me, and I was honest about how I felt.

She sent me the longest, most hurtful message. On one hand, I broke down and cried, the other, felt this strange sense of relief.  I knew where she stood, and I never answered back.

It's a bit of an anticlimactic ending, but it's been almost a year of feeling more free and confident than I ever had.  I finally took the time for focus on what I needed, and it was invigorating.  Bob has stayed by my side and my husband and I still have him over for coffee and puppy cuddles from time to time. They have been my rocks.

Thank you Charlotte and all of you petty potatoes for giving me comfort and clarity when I needed it most. ‚ô•Ô∏è",2,1755976729.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

This is for a lease running from September 1, 2025, through September 2026. We‚Äôre a friendly group of three co-ed UCR students (two females and two males) looking for our fourth housemate. Heads up‚Äîwe need to find someone very soon, so we're looking to make a decision in the next day or two. To secure your spot, first months rent and deposit will need to be ready by August 25th for a September 1st move-in.

The House & Amenities: The base rent is $800 per month, plus utilities, which usually run about $50-$100. You‚Äôll have your own private bedroom in a house that‚Äôs perfect for student life. We have two full bathrooms, a washer and dryer, and a dishwasher. There‚Äôs a spacious living room for hanging out, a backyard, and plenty of parking with both a garage and street spots available. The location can‚Äôt be beaten‚Äîit's an easy 10-15m walk or 5m bike ride right to campus near Lot 30, and the Canyon Crest shops are a quick 5-minute walk away, so you're close to groceries, pharmacies, and everything else you need.

What We're Looking For: We're all UCR students who are serious about our academics but also love a relaxed and social home. We often interact together and are always down to grab coffee or food It's a co-ed house, and we're looking for a responsible, communicative housemate who is considerate of quiet hours and shared boundaries. We want someone who wants a calm, welcoming home but is also happy to hang out sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't have any pets due to allergies.

Landlord Relationship: To make things easy, I handle paying the landlord and utilities so you don't have that hassle. We‚Äôre also always happy to share rides to campus or the store. Our landlord is great‚Äîsuper easy to work with and leaves us alone, which gives us some nice flexibility. We're open to anyone who is a good fit for our house and our easygoing dynamic.

Interested? Let‚Äôs Connect!: If this sounds like a good fit, let me know! I can send you photos and videos for a virtual tour. Since we're moving on this quickly, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested!",1,1755976681.0,ucrhousing,0,1.0,False

I came across a new social app called ***cauldy***, and it‚Äôs experimenting with a different approach to social media:

* üö´ **No algorithm-driven feed** ‚Üí ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù are based on actual conversations, not what the algorithm pushes.
* üó®Ô∏è **Every post has its own chat room** ‚Üí you join with fun random pseudonyms (be *MoonTiger87* today, *CoffeeDuck42* tomorrow).
* ‚úÖ Focus is on **real conversations** instead of clout.
* üëç **Like buttons** exist for each posts with separate buttons for each quotes and pics 
* üë• Instead of followers, you have **‚ÄúShadowers‚Äù** ‚Üí and only *you* know who you shadow, removing the pressure of public counts.

It feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the usual platforms. Right now it‚Äôs still small, which makes discussions feel more authentic and less performative.

üëâ So here‚Äôs my question: **Do you think anonymity + hidden followers actually lead to better conversations?**

1myaayh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myaayh,Maureen starkeys ONLY interview . July 1988.,"Q: So let‚Äôs start at the beginning. How did you first meet Richy?

A: Well‚Ä¶ (pauses) I first met him at the Cavern. I was dating Johnny Guitar at the time in the Hurricanes (You know) and Richy was just the drummer at the time. I don‚Äôt remember when he first asked me out on a date, but he did just after he left the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles. I was excited! Here I was a silly sixteen-year-old hairdresser dating the most popular drummer in Liverpool. Our first date was a little silly. (chuckles) We just walked around the block for a while, gossiping and talking because he had to go back in the Cavern and play again. After a couple of months, I began to realize that I was infatuated with him.

Q: You and Richy went to Greece with Paul [McCartney] and Jane [Asher] in 1963, right?

A: Yes we did.

Q: How was that trip?

A: It was excellent. I think it was my first trip out of the country and I was so thrilled when Richy asked me to go. I was quite nervous because I was going with Paul and his girlfriend, but once we were there I relaxed. Paul is such a nice, genuine person and I quite enjoyed him. I got to know Jane as well during that trip. While Paul and Richy were off horsing around, Jane and I chatted quite a bit. She‚Äôs such an intelligent person and I thought them quite an odd couple at first. Paul is such an assertive fellow (you know) he knows what he wants and Jane is that way too. I often wondered to meself how they ever stayed together as long as they did (you know). Richy isn‚Äôt assertive at all. He‚Äôs pretty laid-back and gentle ‚Äì some people could call him a pushover. He has this inferiority complex about ‚Äòim. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. He just wants me to constantly reassure ‚Äòim that I love him because he gets afraid. We would be lying in bed and he would hold me close to him and say, ‚ÄúDo you really love me?‚Äù I would have to constantly reassure him that I did love him, that I did care for him; and I think he was really pleased to hear me say that to ‚Äòim. He was so afraid that I might not love him.

Q: You attended a couple of studio sessions with him? He said that sometimes he would take you with him.


A: Yeah, I went to a couple of them with him. It was only because he asked me ‚Äì not because I wanted to. I was so used to him coming home from the studio and me sitting up till the crack of dawn waiting for ‚Äôim. Going to his work would seem out of the ordinary (y‚Äôknow), so I told him that if he wanted me to go, I would.


Q: What was it like to sit in the studio with John, Paul and George?


A: It was like watching a couple of actors rehearsing a scene in a movie (laughs). I would sit there with a cup of coffee in my hand and watch them for a while or maybe gossip with Linda [McCartney] or Mal [Evans]. When I did watch them, I always thought to meself, so this is what he‚Äôs been doing for the last six years! (laughs) I sometimes felt like a fly on the wall, but I knew that I had to be the luckiest fly in the world. Pattie [Harrison] would sometimes be there, but she would always leave early.

Q: Yoko Ono was there too.


A: I always thought her strange. I mean she would always interrupt the lads when they were working or do strange things without any reason whatsoever. I was there when John brought the bed, and said something about wanting Yoko to be there. I asked Richy about this and he just shook his head in disbelief. I often wondered how they all put up with her. Even Richy would come home and tell me all these strange stories about her. He once told me about her moaning into John‚Äôs microphone while they were recording a song and how the two of them would make-out during takes. I always avoided her in the studio for those reasons. She was just too strange for me.

Q: Were you there when Richy walked out?

A: No, but I was surprised when he came home so soon. He told me to pack my bags without giving me much of an explanation; but I could see a look of distress in his eyes. It was just painful. I fought with him for a while, I really did and I told him that it was foolish to go away so soon, but I could tell he didn‚Äôt really care at that point. I do remember him muttering something about Paul under his breath- something really dirty which made me believe that Paul and Richy had a row.

Q: Can you recall what Richy said?

A: They were all curse words. I don‚Äôt really want to repeat

Q: (interrupts) Just do the best you can.

A: (laughs and puts her hands to her face) Ohhh.. it‚Äôs easy for you to say.

Q: (Whistles) Wow! Were they that bad?

A: Well pretty much. I will never forget what he muttered as he folded his socks and put them in the suitcase. He said:‚ÄùPaul is a freaking moron.‚Äù

Q: You used freaking instead of the ‚ÄúF‚Äù word?

A: (laughs) Yes I did. He put so much stress on that word that it shocked me to hear him say it because he usually isn‚Äôt like that.


Q: Did you know why he left? Did he tell you?
A: From what I heard him tell Peter [Sellers] on the yacht, Paul wanted a certain drum pattern on a song and Richy was just fed up with his coaching him too much. He usually did something totally opposite of what Paul specifically told him to do, and Paul would get upset.

Q: What would you say is his greatest weakness?

A: His inferiority complex, his low self-esteem. I think, in a way,that was why he turned to drinkin‚Äô so heavily. I think he used it as a cloth to hide his weakness. He would drink to get plastered to hide from it, but he knew that eventually he couldn‚Äôt. I remember he even tried to commit suicide once.

Q: Really?

A: Well, I shouldn‚Äôt say he did it intentionally because it took place when he was drunk (or at least I think so). He tried to cut his throat with his razor in the bathroom. He really frightened me at first, but I knew he wasn‚Äôt conscious of it. It was something that he wouldn‚Äôt have done if he was conscious and I knew this.

Q: Let‚Äôs turn to the positive. What was his greatest strength?

A: Ohhh‚Ä¶ I would say it‚Äôs his personality. Richy is such a cheerful, peaceful man that it‚Äôs wonderful to talk with him. He has a wonderful sense of humor and can be very charming at time. My mother loved him when she first met him because he charmed the socks off of her. (Laughs) He was excellent with children ‚Äì mostly because he‚Äôs usually gentle and playful. I used to comment to him that he still acted like a child, but he laughed it off.

Q: Was he passionate?

A: Oh yes, he could be very passionate when he wanted to be. Especially during meetings (According to the translator, in the article, it was ‚Äùsex‚Äù not meetings). He could be extremely passionate then.

Q: I noticed you haven‚Äôt mentioned John yet? What about him?


A: John is the funniest person you‚Äôd ever want to meet. You could never know when he was being serious. That‚Äôs John for you!

Before that I had tried different pre workouts, never really found any of them much use and some had the opposite effect, couldn‚Äôt focus on a workout because of the tingles and jitters. I do a lot of hiit classes so being jacked on pre workout probably doesn‚Äôt help if the heart rate is through the roof. All that said, I have noticed for the last year that it is getting harder to get going for the workouts. I am fine once I get going but it takes a real conscious effort to make myself ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô I have a blast of energy, instead of having real energy and ready to blast the workout. So I have been toying with the idea of giving some pre workouts a try again. My question is; is it worth experimenting with some pre workouts, if so what would you recommend?

1mya74q,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCSpend/comments/1mya74q/reveal_the_truth_about_the_huion_h950p_drawing/,Reveal the Truth About the Huion H950P Drawing Tablet Bundle,"The HUION Inspiroy H950P Drawing Tablet caught my attention right away, as someone who spends countless hours sketching, illustrating, and designing on a computer. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for something that feels closer to drawing on paper while still allowing for digital flexibility. This tablet promised a lot‚Äîcustomizable keys, multi-OS compatibility, and a professional battery-free stylus‚Äîand I was itching to put it to the test. After weeks of using it daily, I have plenty of thoughts to share.  

**Design and Build**  
The H950P has a super sleek and compact form factor, and I was surprised by how thin it was‚Äîjust 0.3 inches thick, making it incredibly portable. While I was carrying it between my desk, couch, and the occasional coffee shop (because why not?), the lightweight design, about 1.76 pounds, didn‚Äôt add any unnecessary baggage. It feels sturdy despite being so slim, so I never felt like I had to baby it. The drawing surface is smooth but not slippery, giving it a texture that mimics paper without making my pen strokes feel gritty. This aspect alone improves the drawing experience significantly, adding to the natural feel.  

**Customize Your Workflow**  
HUION excels when it comes to customization. The tablet features eight press keys that can each be programmed to perform your most-used shortcuts. Personally, I hate wasting time hunting through menus while in mid-flow with a design project, so setting these up with actions like undo, redo, and brush adjustments was a game changer for me. Moreover, the Huion driver allows you to program these keys differently for various apps. For example, my shortcuts for Photoshop differ from what I use in Illustrator, and the transition between programs is seamless once everything is set up. A neat touch is that left-handed users won‚Äôt feel left behind since the settings support them as well.  

**[Check HUION H950P price on Amazon.](https://mincopc.com/p/b0d2vmbdck/)**  

**Stylus and Performance**  
The included stylus PW100 is battery-free, which eliminates the need to deal with recharging‚Äîthank goodness. It has an impressive 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity, and it didn‚Äôt take long to notice just how finely it could detect differences in pressure levels. I‚Äôm talking about strokes as light as a feather to heavy, deliberate lines, all of which translated beautifully on screen. Switching between pen and eraser using the side buttons was also intuitive and reduced interruptions during workflow. Holding the pen for hours didn‚Äôt feel cumbersome either; it‚Äôs lightweight yet feels balanced in hand. As someone who sketches obsessively, the comfort of this stylus stood out.  

**Target User Group**  
This tablet will make hobbyists and enthusiasts quite happy, but I think it truly shines for professionals working with multiple programs or those who want sleek hardware that doesn‚Äôt eat up desktop real estate. Students and budding digital artists are also likely to appreciate its accessible size alongside its high-end features. Its compatibility with Mac, Windows, Linux, and even Android pushes flexibility to the next level. During commutes, testing it on a mobile device became surprisingly fun, adding versatility that some higher-priced competitors lack.  

**Good Points**  
- High pressure sensitivity ensures precise drawings.  
- Compact design makes it portable and easy to handle.  
- Fully customizable keys allow for efficient multitasking.  
- Battery-free stylus eliminates the frustration of recharging.  
- Multiplatform compatibility ensures broad usability.  

**Not-so-Great Aspects**  
There are a couple of areas where it didn‚Äôt hit the mark entirely, though. It‚Äôs important to note these small nitpicks since not everything‚Äôs perfect:  
- The driver installation process for Mac felt less smooth than on Windows.  
- While it‚Äôs functional on Android, the smaller screen size can feel limiting for intricate designs.  
- The pen nibs seem to wear down a bit faster than I expected.  

**Market Rivals**  
Many graphics tablets are floating around in this price and features range, and Wacom immediately comes to mind as a major competitor. The Wacom Intuos Pro, for example, offers similar pressure sensitivity and customizable options, but it‚Äôs bulkier and significantly more expensive. However, when it comes to software quality, Wacom drivers are a bit more polished. XP-PEN is another strong contender, particularly regarding affordability, but HUION‚Äôs stylus quality and portability put it a notch higher in my books. While competitors bring their strengths, HUION balances performance, price, and portability incredibly well, which is why I find this tablet appealing for creators like me.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Investing in creative tools often comes down to whether a product fits seamlessly into your life, and this drawing tablet delivers enough to justify its cost. You‚Äôre getting high-end features for a fraction of what bigger brands charge, and it strikes a balance between functionality and affordability. For professionals or enthusiasts who need solid performance without breaking the bank, this tablet is a smart choice.

My diet right now is literally only white rice, whole apples, eggs, and coffee (I know, caffeine and histamines, but I can't put myself through withdrawal right now lol). 

I realized I haven't been taking this seriously. My MCAS has been taking a back seat to ME and a laundry list of comorbidities; but now I see *it's probably been the single biggest contributing factor to my health issues.*

Most of them immediately tell you about keeping it to yourself, convincing you that you would be a creep for sharing those feelings with your crush.

I've decided to go through that, and share my own experience, hoping this can help other people in my position.

First of all, I want to let clear that I agree with the general opinion. Telling your crush how you feel after being rejected is selfish. I can't help but feel that I wanted to ease my pain by splitting it with her. Any opinions on the matter are welcome.

**A brief context:**

I am 30 year old guy who's never had a girlfriend before, In my previous job, I met this beautiful lady, same age as me, likes same stuff as me, incredible personality.

After about a year I decided to ask her out, she told me that she would go just as long as it would be in group with friends. I tried very hard to gather any group of friends that I have, to set a reunion. I had really bad luck at that time, and something wrong always happened.

I've decided to tell her that I liked her. She rejected me kindly, and told me that she was not emotionally available at the moment. She was cold with me for a about a week, but next week we could talk like always.

The first weeks I felt very relieved, but, some time after, my fantasies kept making me go to scenarios where I could finally date her.

My crush for her returned, really hard this time, and decided to ask her out again to a friend's birthday. She agreed, but stood me up that day. I felt really bad, I cried all night. The following weeks, I was battling two ideas on my head, if she was avoiding me, or if I was being overly sensitive if some times she wouldn‚Äôt reply to my greetings.

All I could think about, was hiding my emotions to her. If I saw her walking by the hallway, I panicked really hard and put a lot of energy into not showing myself worried just to saying ""Hi"" to her. I decided I could no longer bear it and I had to expose my self to her.

**Telling her how I was feeling:**

I chose to tell her my feelings in two ways. I knew that If I would just speak with her, I would forget something, so I decided to write a letter. I would first speak face to face with her, and then, deliver the letter.

I told her that I felt really bad when she stood me up, my really bad luck, my ideas about her avoiding me. I apologized to her a lot for bringing something that she did not asked for (my insistence on a date and my hurt feelings, specially when she had rejected me already).

She apologized to me for not going to the party, then she explained to me, that she felt like not having a boyfriend for a very long time, she assured me that she was not avoiding me, and scold me a little by making bad assumptions on my head.

We shook hands and each of us parted our way to home.

**After telling her:**

Just like before, I felt very relieved the first weekend. I couldn't believed how good everything went after speaking with her.

That good feeling lasted very little, since the following weeks. While I decided to limit my interactions with her, this time I definitively felt like she was avoiding me. A couple of times I tried to make a small talk with her at the coffee stand, but she only would say Hi to me and not reply at all.

I noticed that she was not speaking directly to me, she would only reply to some other coworker or, addressing somebody else before talking with me. After realizing of that, I decided to cut every single form of interaction with her.

**Getting better:**

Some months later, she rasigned from that job for unkown reasons to me. That felt like the most refreshing thing EVER. I was no longer having to panic every time I see her walking at the hallway, or being awkward in front of her.

The first three months were as bad as always, but something happened at the end of the third month and I started feeling more cheered than before. To this day, It has been six months since the last day I knew of her, and while I keep thinking of her as the most amazing woman I ever met, I am starting to finally accept the things as they went.

Now that I have shared my story, I want to share some insights that I learned after all of this.

**-My mistakes-**

**Desperation**.

The biggest mistake I made was for sure -feeling too hard- Since I've never had a girlfriend before, having one became the ult√≠mate goal in my life. I felt way too desperate about partnering with this beautiful woman who matches with my ideal partner fantasies, that led me to insecure feelings towards her.

**Pedestalizing her.**

I heard that word in ‚Äú40 year old virgin‚Äù I thought that I had understood that word, but now I know what truly means. Feeling way too anxious if she rejects you, thinking that a compliment would reveal my intentions and scare her away from me. Fantasize with her as my ideal partner while hiding my feelings from her.

In retrospective, I feel very dumb for not realizing what I was doing.

**Not distancing from her.**

One indisputable truth is that keep being close to her was a bad thing for me, since I was being a total looser by fantasizing with another opportunity to ask her out. I should have known that I was not ready for being a friend after being rejected by someone I had a lot of fantasies with. It requires a lot of maturity not getting too attached and accepting a friendship rather than a relationship. I find really hard to believe that any person even at their 50's can get that level of maturity, and while I know for sure there are people like that, I am not one of them, and its best for me to just walk away after being rejected.

**-Things That I've learned-**

**The letter was a double-edged sword.**

Delivering the letter was a very interesting thing. Every time I felt like I wanted to tell her something, I realized that I already have said that in some way, I would be totally out of place by telling her again. So by exposing myself in the letter, a combination of shame and ""sense of honor"" prevent me from reaching to her again.  
‚ÄúI‚Äòm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable‚Äù Already in the letter.

‚ÄúI feel like you are avoiding me‚Äù Already in the letter.

**I have a very bad problem on getting too attached to my crushes**

No matter what I do, I always end becoming too attached to my fantasies, and got very disappointed when rejected. While I was coming out of my pain by being ignored by her, I realized something very important **""It's not okay that thinking about some one, make me feel so bad""**. My attraction process gets me to that position, and I am the only one to blame in that matter. My only way to fight it is gaining self confidence, so I don't depend on my fantasies to validate my worth.

No matter what I could have done, the only way that I was going to overcome that, was one of us resign from work .

I had to go through all of that to learn this about myself.

**I learned a very important lesson about pedestalizing.**

Today I wish I hadn't been so worried about her rejection, so I could have allowed myself to compliment her looks, even flirt with her a little, and be sure that she would take it as an actual compliment.

Some people have already figured all of this based on their previous relationships. Since I've never had a partner, this was the only way I was going to learn it.

**Conclusions**

Telling your crush how you feel after being rejected is a selfish act, but some people have to go through all of that, since it's the only way they might over come the situation.

This post should not be taken as a recommendation of how to do it, but If you already decided what you are about to do, please keep in mind the following.

1.-The most important thing you can do is talking with a friend before doing that, it is very important that this person don't make you feel judged, it has to be some one that can give you advice on how to direct your emotions, rather than just calling you a looser for not being able to keep it to yourself.

2.- Despite I know for sure writing is not for everyone, I highly advice on writing a letter at least two weeks before confessing. I spent a week writing and editing everything I wanted. I wish I have waited at least one week before handling her the letter, since two days after I realized I could have changed some very shameful things I said to her. While I was writing my letter I kept thinking to myself ""Love is not for cowards"" While I think that is a really good stand for starter, you would definitely want to reflect on what you are about to deliver.

3.- This will sound clich√©, but there is just no rules for every situation, for every person, for every context. I decided that exposing my feelings to my crush after being rejected was the only thing I could do to stop worrying about hiding my emotions in front of her, you might be in the same situation as me, but maybe you need a different approach. My biggest advice is to define for yourself a list of morals that you need to stick to.

In my case,I knew for sure that she had made a decision and had to respect it, wether I like it or not.

With that in mind, confessing to her was an act of selfishness, since I didn't want to either abandon the hope on dating her, or overcome my need for her approval. She had to walk away from the job, and I had to cut my interactions with her so I could start healing.

Distance and time. Its hard, its not quick, it will be painful, but it will heal.

1my9zc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1my9zc3/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting?,"So I (f) started college last year, and in the beginning I was really worried about making friends. Luckily, I pushed myself to be outgoing, and it paid off ‚Äî me and about five other girls got really close. We‚Äôd grab coffee, study together almost every day, and even did all our projects together. Everything felt great‚Ä¶ until finals.

Finals month was brutal: multiple presentations, exams, assignments ‚Äî the usual chaos. That‚Äôs when issues started with one girl in the group, let‚Äôs call her K.

K has a photographic memory and often took the lead in study sessions. She would make Kahoots to quiz us before exams, but over time we noticed that sometimes the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers she put were actually wrong. We‚Äôd believe her answers were right, then bomb quizzes/tests while she‚Äôd ace them. üö©

Then came a math-heavy class with a major take-home exam. A few of us (myself included) were struggling and planned to do it together with K since she was strong in that subject. But all week K ignored our texts and calls, only to later say ‚Äúit‚Äôs super easy‚Äù with some half-baked explanation. We were really thrown off because we thought she‚Äôd help us, especially since we were struggling badly.

Here‚Äôs some important context: our GPA system is based not only on your grade but also on the class average. The higher your grade and the lower the class average, the better for you. We started realizing her motive ‚Äî if we did worse, it would benefit her.

Other red flags:
	‚Ä¢	One girl was hospitalized and asked K for notes. K promised to share them but instead sent them to her crush (who already has a girlfriend??).
	‚Ä¢	In another class where almost everyone was failing, the final exam was worth 50%. We noticed during practice quizzes that she‚Äôd score 100 while the rest of us got 40‚Äì50. It really seemed like she was feeding us wrong info on purpose.
	‚Ä¢	During the final itself, one girl was clearly struggling and asked K for help. K straight-up ignored her and left the room. Later she acted all nervous like ‚Äúomg I totally failed that‚Äù ‚Äî but she always ended up scoring in the 90s.

The consequences were real. One girl in our group ended up failing and had to restart the entire program, losing a whole year. And after finals, we found out that the assignment K had refused to work on with us? She secretly completed it with another girl (‚ÄúM‚Äù) instead.

Now we‚Äôre back this semester. The girl who failed is gone, M is in a different group, and it‚Äôs just me and three others sticking together. K is still around, acting confused about why people are mad at her. Meanwhile, most of the program has caught on and people warn each other about her. Yet she keeps reposting stuff about ‚Äúhaving no female friends‚Äù while ignoring the fact that she basically pushed everyone away herself.

I‚Äôve been cordial but distant. The others are still angry, and honestly, it‚Äôs sad to see the group fall apart like this. Part of me wonders if we‚Äôre overreacting‚Ä¶ but another part feels like she intentionally sabotaged us for her own benefit. AIO? ",1,1755975784.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.67,False

1my9z7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1my9z7l/aita_for_moving_on_from_a_friendship/,AITA for moving on from a friendship,"I have just graduated from high school and I used to have a friend group of me (M) and two other guys. We were pretty close.

Now, let‚Äôs call them A and B. I was especially closer to A (we were sticked to each other almost 24/7). I used to quite enjoy having him as a companion but over time I realized that we didn‚Äôt really fit each other and we had more differences than similarities (I do understand that not everyone is the same so it‚Äôs okay to have differences but it really felt like we had a huge gap between each other which is why we often ran into arguments, and whenever this happened, he would suddenly become silent and ghosted me for a while. This happened more than once and every time it happened I would be the only one to overthink, while he was away hanging out with his other friends instead of trying to make an effort to have a talk with me since I did! But to no avail‚Ä¶). Our friendship started to become exhausting for me.

*To dive deeper in to this, I will tell you some side stories*: I‚Äôm gonna be hones, there was an instance where I think I executed things pretty poorly. After the entrance exam two months ago, I went to the gym with A and yet again we got into another argument (he was much stronger than me, I was just a beginner but he applied his routines for me and I was too tired, I wanted to rest for a bit but I got yelled at as a result and it was tense). I went with him for about 3-4 days and suddenly I found out that I had elevated liver enzymes. So I had to stay at the hospital for more than a month. Back then, I was still talking to him through texts sometimes, but while staying at the hospital, I rethought about everything I have been through and the actual emotions I felt at such times so I decided to go with what would be the best for myself.
Some times after that, I got to go back home to rest. 
A said he wanted to visit me with B, I didn‚Äôt want to meet anybody because I was still not feeling well so I just told him that and he didn‚Äôt have to come but he still came anyway- Because of that, I decided to stay in my room, wore a headphone and locked the door. When he came in he was banging at my room‚Äôs door for almost an hour but he gave up anyway. Now, right after that, I found out from my sister that he took my Identity Card from my wallet (I left it outside of my room at that time) to threaten me to come outside (???). I was flabbergasted with his action. But luckily she managed to take it back for me.
I felt kinda bad because A and B had to sit outside while waiting for me but I still surely do not like what A did

Now back to the main story, after this I finally decided to tell him that I no longer felt the connections and I wanted us to stop (I know the way I‚Äôm saying it makes it sound like we are lovers but I promise with you this is not the case üíÄ). I have always thought about his feelings so I did consider what to say and what shouldn‚Äôt and I communicated with him in the nicest way as possible but in return he guilt-tripped me. I said we had more differences than similarities but he told me that because I stayed at home too much and barely hung out with him so we do not have any similarities (I had to treat my illness, plus we had always been near each other before and hung out a lot too?) he proceeded to tell me that I was too childish and what I said were just nonsense to him and he told me to discuss with my MOM about my own thoughts and decisions before getting back to him later. At this point I knew that he was not having it so I decided to just end it and told him I appreciated our friendship and thanked him for it. He replied with ‚ÄúNo need to thank, I didn‚Äôt do much anyway‚Äù and he told me he were grateful because I helped him with studies at school. 

I thought this was the end to this whole situation but NO, it was not. Out of nowhere (some hours after our talk), he sent me a screenshot of ChatGPT which had him asking whether my liver condition had turned me into a PSYCHOPATH (for some reason it said yes), he then told me that I was mentally unstable and should go to a psych ward to cure it. Additionally, he somehow managed to drag my mom and HIS mom into this. He told his mom to text me and told me to go on a coffee date with him and her one day (which I declined) AND he messaged my mom and literally told her I was distancing myself from others and I became crazy. He even suggested my mom to guard me at home so him and B could come to talk to me (???). At this point, I finally realized how wild he actually was and keep being nice to him wouldn‚Äôt do.

Afterwards, I just unfollowed him on every social media and we have been silent since then‚Ä¶


*Another small side story*: I have a streak on TikTok with B. I‚Äôm not as close with him but we have always been fine with each other. Recently, I haven‚Äôt been active on it as I‚Äôve been preparing some documents to attend college. As a result, I lost the streak with him twice (which I did recover). However, today he suddenly told me I didn‚Äôt have to force myself to continue keeping the streak. I explained and showed him the proofs that I haven‚Äôt been active on it so I forgot about our streak but he hasn‚Äôt replied which got me thinking that he may have misunderstood. Because of what happened with me and A, I had a feeling B probably associated it with me also wanting to also cut ties with him, which is not the case.



I‚Äôm sorry that this has been quite long and messy but if you have read all of it, I would like to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks! üôè

Gave me the right size, a nice MDF board as base and a nice frame with the bonus of dope presentation. Will definitely use this method going forward on making these boards. If you want to do it too, I have 2 pointers for you:

1. Turn the frame over and model into the backside. That way you do not have to awkwardly fill the front and the frame is just as nice.

2. Glue the board into the frame last so you do not have to protect the frame while painting nad flocking and you will not have a hard time cleaning up the masking board.

The board and terrain were magnetized in a few places. Materials were the frame, XPS, some balsa, coffee stir sticks, homemade flocking, PVA and cheap artist acrylics.

1my9x67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheBits/comments/1my9x67/explore_if_the_best_touchscreen_laptop_dell/,Explore if the best touchscreen laptop Dell Inspiron 3520 truly delivers,"The Dell Inspiron 3520 quickly became a central part of my daily grind when I started using it. With its balanced design, responsive touchscreen, and robust performance, it seemed like it could handle anything I threw at it. This laptop offers features that cater to a broad audience, from casual users to professionals. However, no device is perfect, and this model has its quirks. After weeks of testing its performance, exploring every corner of its functionality, and even letting my tech-savvy cousin toy around with it, I feel equipped to share all the major highs and a few considerations you should keep in mind before buying it. 

**Design: Clean and Functional**  
From a visual perspective, this laptop sits firmly in the category of sleek practicality. The carbon black finish looks refined without being ostentatious, making it fit into diverse environments like my home office, a coffee shop, or even the corner of a bustling coworking space. At 3.65 pounds and just under an inch thick, carrying it around isn‚Äôt a chore, though it‚Äôs not exactly ultrabook-light either. One drawback is the non-backlit keyboard; typing in dimly lit areas felt like a wild guessing game at times, and that‚Äôs definitely something to consider if you work late nights. Beyond that, the layout is comfortable, and I loved the spacious trackpad, which performed well for multitouch gestures.

**Performance: A Smooth Ride for Everyday Tasks**  
Powered by the 12th Gen Intel i5-1235U processor and paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, the Dell Inspiron is a multitasking champ. Over the weeks, I used it to juggle multiple browser tabs, light photo editing, Spotify in the background, and even a couple of casual games during lunch breaks. In every scenario, it kept up without breaking a sweat. However, the integrated Intel UHD Graphics means this laptop is not for heavy gaming or video rendering. If you're looking for a performance boost in such areas, you may need to look elsewhere, but for regular productivity work? No complaints so far.

**Check [Dell Inspiron 3520 price on Amazon.](https://solarpark.org/p/b0dbzjywvc/)**

**Display: Crisp with a Touch of Convenience**  
The standout feature here is the 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen display. It‚Äôs surprisingly responsive and added a layer of convenience I didn‚Äôt realize I needed. Navigating through apps, zooming into tiny Excel cells, or doodling rough ideas with a stylus felt seamless. The anti-glare finish was a blessing during sunny afternoons by the window, easing up my eye strain significantly. However, colors seemed a tad muted compared to a premium IPS panel I‚Äôve used, leaving media consumption slightly underwhelming at times. It‚Äôs not a deal-breaker, but worth noting if vibrant visuals are a priority.

**Good Points**  
- Responsive and crisp Full HD touchscreen.
- Reliable multitasking with the Intel i5 and 16GB DDR4 RAM.
- Sleek carbon black design suitable for multiple environments.
- Lightweight and portable for a 15.6-inch laptop.
- Generous 1TB NVMe SSD storage for professionals with heavy file needs.

**Battery Life: A Mixed Bag**  
The 41Whr 3-cell battery lasted about 5-6 hours during moderate usage, which included browsing, streaming, and some minor edits on Google Docs. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking but decent for a laptop in this range. What I found slightly frustrating was the machine's charging speed‚Äîit feels slower than comparable models. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs constantly on the go and needs a quick recharge, this could be an inconvenience. I had to get creative at times to make sure chargers were never far away when working remotely.

**Limitations**  
- Non-backlit keyboard makes night usage challenging.
- Charging feels a bit slow for mobile professionals.
- Colors on the display could be more vibrant for media-heavy users.

**Connectivity Options: Everything You Need**  
Between the HDMI 1.4b port, 2x USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone/mic combo jack, there was no situation where I felt lacking in connectivity. It connected to my Bluetooth devices effortlessly‚Äîwhether it was headphones or an external mouse, the process was quick and painless. WiFi connectivity was smooth, with no noticeable drops during Zoom calls or during my weekend Netflix marathons. While the port selection covers all the basics, an additional USB-C port might‚Äôve been a nice touch to future-proof the device.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other laptops like the HP Pavilion series or ASUS VivoBook, the Inspiron 3520 holds its ground well with its robust processor and responsive touchscreen. The Pavilion may feel more premium due to features like backlit keyboards or Bang & Olufsen audio tuning, but the Inspiron keeps it strong with its storage capacity and reliable performance. Meanwhile, the VivoBook might offer slightly better battery life but falls behind in terms of display size and SSD storage configurations. Every choice here depends on priorities, but the Inspiron leans toward being a productivity powerhouse for those who value speed, storage, and touchscreen functionality.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of value proposition, the Dell Inspiron 3520 is undoubtedly worth considering for the everyday user, student, or those stepping into the professional world. While it lacks the premium polish or extra features of higher-end devices, it brings a reliable, decently priced package to the table. Its combination of storage, processor performance, and touchscreen functionality justifies its position in the mid-range market.

1my9wbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1my9wbz/why_90_of_ai_videos_sound_terrible_the_audio/,Why 90% of AI videos sound terrible (the audio guide everyone ignores),"this is 7going to be a long post but audio is the most overlooked element that separates viral AI content from garbage‚Ä¶

Spent 9 months obsessing over visuals - perfect prompts, camera movements, lighting, color grading. My videos looked amazing but felt lifeless. Engagement was mediocre at best.

Then I discovered something that changed everything: **Audio context makes AI video feel real even when it‚Äôs obviously artificial.**

Most creators completely ignore audio elements in their prompts. Massive mistake that kills engagement before viewers realize why.

# The Audio Psychology Breakthrough:

**Visual:** What you see

**Audio:** How you FEEL about what you see

**Same video with different audio = completely different emotional response.**

Your brain processes audio faster than visual. Bad audio makes good visuals feel wrong. Good audio makes mediocre visuals feel amazing.

# Audio Cues That Actually Work:

# Environmental Audio:

    ""Audio: gentle wind through trees, distant birds""
    ""Audio: city traffic hum, occasional car horn""
    ""Audio: ocean waves lapping, seagull calls""
    ""Audio: rain pattering on windows, distant thunder""
    

**Why it works:** Creates believable space context

# Action-Specific Audio:

    ""Audio: footsteps on wet concrete""
    ""Audio: mechanical keyboard clicking, mouse clicks""
    ""Audio: pages turning, paper rustling""
    ""Audio: glass clinking, liquid pouring""
    

**Why it works:** Makes actions feel physically real

# Emotional Audio:

    ""Audio: heartbeat getting faster""
    ""Audio: heavy breathing, slight echo""
    ""Audio: clock ticking, building tension""
    ""Audio: soft humming, peaceful ambiance""
    

**Why it works:** Guides audience emotional state

# Technical Audio:

    ""Audio: electrical humming, circuit buzzing""
    ""Audio: machinery whirring, gears turning""
    ""Audio: digital glitches, electronic beeps""
    ""Audio: camera shutter clicks, focus sounds""
    

**Why it works:** Reinforces high-tech/professional feel

# Platform-Specific Audio Strategy:

# TikTok:

* **Trending sounds > original audio**
* **High energy beats work best**
* **Audio needs to grab attention in first 2 seconds**
* **Sync visual beats with audio beats**

# Instagram:

* **Original audio performs better**
* **Smooth, atmospheric audio preferred**
* **Audio should enhance mood, not distract**
* **Licensed music works well for brand content**

# YouTube:

* **Educational voiceover + ambient audio**
* **Longer audio beds acceptable**
* **Tutorial content benefits from clear narration**
* **Background music should support, not compete**

# The Technical Implementation:

# Basic Audio Prompt Structure:

    [VISUAL CONTENT], Audio: [ENVIRONMENTAL] + [ACTION] + [EMOTIONAL]
    
    Example: ""Person walking through rain, Audio: rain on pavement + footsteps splashing + distant thunder, peaceful ambiance""
    

# Advanced Audio Layering:

    Primary: Main environmental sound
    Secondary: Action-specific sounds
    Tertiary: Emotional/atmospheric elements
    
    Example: ""Cyberpunk street scene, Audio: city traffic (primary) + neon sign buzzing (secondary) + distant techno music (tertiary)""
    

# Real Examples That Transform Content:

# Before (Visual Only):

    ""Beautiful woman drinking coffee in caf√©""
    

**Result:** Looks pretty but feels artificial

# After (Visual + Audio):

    ""Beautiful woman drinking coffee in caf√©, Audio: coffee shop ambiance, gentle conversation murmur, espresso machine steaming, ceramic cup setting on saucer""
    

**Result:** Feels like you‚Äôre actually there

# Before (Visual Only):

    ""Sports car driving through tunnel""
    

**Result:** Looks cool but no impact

# After (Visual + Audio):

    ""Sports car driving through tunnel, Audio: engine roar echoing off walls, tire squeal on concrete, wind rushing past, gear shifts""
    

**Result:** Visceral, engaging experience

# Audio Context for Different Content Types:

# Product Showcase:

    ""Audio: subtle ambient hum, satisfying click sounds, premium material interactions""
    

# Portrait/Beauty:

    ""Audio: soft breathing, gentle fabric movement, natural environmental ambiance""
    

# Action/Sports:

    ""Audio: crowd cheering distance, equipment sounds, heavy breathing, ground impact""
    

# Tech/Business:

    ""Audio: keyboard typing, mouse clicks, notification sounds, office ambiance""
    

# Nature/Landscape:

# The Cost Factor for Audio Testing:

Audio experimentation requires multiple generations to test different combinations. Google‚Äôs direct Veo3 pricing makes this expensive.

I‚Äôve been using [veo3gen.app](https://veo3gen.app/) for audio testing - they offer Veo3 access at much lower costs, makes systematic audio experimentation financially viable.

# Advanced Audio Techniques:

# Audio Progression:

    Start: ""Distant city sounds""
    Middle: ""Approaching footsteps, sounds getting closer""
    End: ""Close-up audio, intimate sound space""
    

**Creates natural audio journey**

# Emotional Audio Arcs:

    Tension: ""Quiet ambiance, building to intense sounds""
    Release: ""Chaotic sounds settling to peaceful calm""
    Surprise: ""Normal audio suddenly interrupted by unexpected sound""
    

**Guides audience emotional experience**

# Synchronized Audio-Visual:

    ""Camera zoom matches audio intensity increase""
    ""Visual rhythm synced with audio beats""
    ""Audio cues precede visual changes by 0.5 seconds""
    

**Creates professional, intentional feel**

# Common Audio Mistakes:

1. **No audio context at all** (biggest mistake)
2. **Generic ‚Äúambient music‚Äù without specificity**
3. **Audio that competes with visual instead of supporting**
4. **Inconsistent audio perspective with camera angle**
5. **Forgetting platform audio preferences**

# Audio Analysis Framework:

When I see viral AI content, I analyze:

* **What audio creates the emotional hook?**
* **How does audio support the visual narrative?**
* **What specific sounds make it feel ‚Äúreal‚Äù?**
* **How does audio guide attention/pacing?**

# The Results After Adding Audio Focus:

* **3x higher engagement rates** on identical visual content
* **Comments mentioning ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù and ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù** increased dramatically
* **Longer watch times** from improved audio context
* **Platform performance improved** across all channels

# Industry-Specific Audio Libraries:

# Tech/Startup Content:

    - Keyboard mechanical clicks
    - Mouse button sounds
    - Notification pings
    - Video call audio
    - Office ambient hum
    

# Lifestyle/Beauty:

    - Fabric rustling
    - Cosmetic container clicks
    - Water droplet sounds
    - Soft breathing
    - Page turning
    

# Automotive/Action:

    - Engine sounds specific to vehicle type
    - Tire on different road surfaces
    - Wind noise at speed
    - Mechanical interactions
    - Impact sounds
    

# The Meta Strategy:

**Most creators optimize visuals. Smart creators optimize the complete sensory experience.**

Audio context:

* Makes artificial feel authentic
* Guides emotional response
* Increases engagement time
* Improves platform algorithm performance
* Creates memorable content

# Systematic Audio Development:

**Build audio libraries organized by:**

* Content type (portrait, product, action)
* Emotional goal (tension, calm, energy)
* Platform optimization (TikTok vs Instagram)
* Technical requirements (voiceover compatible)

**The audio breakthrough transformed my content from pretty pictures to engaging experiences.** Audiences feel the difference even when they don‚Äôt consciously notice the audio work.

Audio is the secret weapon most AI creators ignore. Once you start thinking audio-first, your content immediately feels more professional and engaging.

Been going though alot lately, a mix of things and I'm AuDHD, but I just haven't felt myself and have been working on my mental health and reached out to my doc.  A few days ago I sat and talked to/with Freyja at the shrine we have for her (I follow a few deities, but Mother Freyja has been in my life for the longest and I have great love and respect for her and the myths), and I guess he heard me say I might not be as active in my daily rituals for awhile to make sure my mental health is okay.   
**Now the kicker.** My husband of 15 years is a life long Christian, completely cool with my life choices as long as I explain things to him. He knew I was a pagan and witch before we married.   
Well, the past few days I've been in a bad low, but noticed when I got home from work there was a fresh cup of coffee at her shrine and a used incense stick. I thought I was going crazy so I asked him and he told me he had been doing it cause he felt it was right.   
I will admit, I'm am completely shocked, I have never asked him to take part or honor anyone or thing I work with. He even showed me! He just sits the coffee down, lights the stick, and even tries talking to her for a moment. Mostly just saying Hi and thank you, but still.   
I followed all this by asking if he thought his god would frown at him for it. He just kissed me and said ""John 13:34""   
Being raised by a pastor, I knew what he was saying just by stating the passage. Now I've been happy crying on and off all day since and I heard he tell his buddies on Discord he thinks he did good.

The only thing I do now is weed so you really don't have to worry about anything in that regard. I'm 35, I work, I'm a bit of a nerd, I love cooking. If you're down for board games and the such, I'm down too. I'm chill, I mostly just hang out in my room and game or hang out on vc with my bf and his friends. I'm not super loud. I like animes, union arena, ghosts and spooky things, horror, video games, music. I'm a bit alternative if you wanna label me. If you wanna know more about my story, feel free to ask. 

If you're interested, please send me a dm and introduce yourself. We can arrange for coffee or the like to see if we vibe and I can send pics and stuff. 

Please, someone give this a shot, I'm really looking for a friend too as my best friend/roommate was my only friend in the city and now I'm gonna have no one.

1my9pyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlkalineWaterBetter/comments/1my9pyr/alklyte_increases_the_sweetness_of_your_drinks/,"Alklyte Increases the ""Sweetness"" of Your Drinks and Can Reduce Your Sugar Intake ‚Äì Here‚Äôs How and Why!","Ever notice how some drinks taste sweeter when they're less acidic?

That‚Äôs not just your imagination ‚Äî there‚Äôs real science behind it. When you reduce the acidity of a beverage, it actually **enhances your perception of sweetness**, even if the sugar content stays the same (or is lower). And that‚Äôs where **Alklyte** comes in.

üî¨ **How it Works:**  
Most beverages ‚Äî even healthy ones like lemonade, iced tea, or flavored waters ‚Äî are fairly acidic. That acid dulls your ability to taste sweetness. Alklyte gently **neutralizes some of the acid** using a dual-buffering system (bicarbonate + citrate), **shifting the pH slightly alkaline** without significantly altering flavor in a harsh way.

The result? **Your drink tastes sweeter with less sugar.**

**Example Recipe: ‚ÄúLemonade Lite‚Äù (Half the Sugar, Double the Sweetness)**

üß™ Ingredients:

* ¬Ω cup store-bought lemonade (like Simply Lemonade)
* ¬Ω cup water
* 1 small serving Alklyte 

üåÄ Stir or shake until dissolved. Taste and adjust water/Alklyte balance to your liking.

üëâ **Effect:** You just cut the sugar in half ‚Äî but it still tastes sweet (or sweeter!) because Alklyte reduces acidity and boosts natural sweetness perception. Kids love this trick.  And you increase your body's own natural acid base balance by providing citrates as well as bicarbonates.  Only Alklyte provides a ""Dual Buffer.""  

**Other Uses:**

* üßã **Iced Teas:** Add Alklyte to make unsweetened or lightly sweetened teas taste smoother and sweeter.
* ‚òïÔ∏è **Coffee:** Add a pinch to reduce bitterness and acid ‚Äî you might not need cream or sugar.
* üßÉ **Fruit Juices:** Stretch juice with water, then add Alklyte to maintain sweetness without all the sugar.

**Why It Matters:**  
Over time, this can help reduce your daily sugar intake **without feeling deprived**. Instead of replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners, you're working *with your body‚Äôs taste perception* by balancing pH.

I‚Äôve personally reduced my sugar cravings by 50‚Äì70% just using this trick. Plus, fewer acidic drinks means better teeth, less heartburn, and maybe even better energy.

üí¨ Have you tried this? Post your own low-sugar drink hacks below ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôve found other combos that work with Alklyte or alkaline water in general. I‚Äôll add the best ones to a recipe thread!

üß™ Stay hydrated and alkalized,  
‚Äî Chris

While I was looking around some (possibly) middle aged woman approached me as she went down the aisle and complimented my shirt since it did show that I played a specific sport. It was nice and we had a good conversation for like 2 minutes until she started to say that I ""had"" a good personality and that I would be a good fit in their new ecommerce business that she and her husband would want to start. She even aske for my number which I thought was weird even though I said that I might not be able to and that while it is interesting I just might not be the right fit for something like that. She then proceeds to invite me for a sit down with her and some coffee for some reason which really started to creep me out since my ""optimistic personality,"" really made me ""stand out."" I then refused again politely and her smile started to fade away. Now I personally have been to Walmart countless times and sometimes even more than once a day but this was the first time I have encountered something like this. What started off as a friendly compliment then turned into something just kinda creepy. Note that after I said no to her she then said bye and thank you and left in a very passive way.

I wanted to give my opinion and rundown on all the character so far. What I think still needs to be done and the improvements so far. Get ready to read :]

SMG4: This guy hasn‚Äôt been my favorite as of recent. He‚Äôs still an arrogant prick. It‚Äôs good that he helps his friends and is still somewhat smart..but dude, he is so dumb. Idk why they make him seem like a leader, because he‚Äôs not good at that. We‚Äôre still wanting the episode where everyone calls him out.

SMG3: They hardly ever change anything about him, but he‚Äôs my favorite. I enjoy him more than 4. He can be mean still, but he has common sense. He loves his dog, has a coffee shop, what more could we ask for? Besides Luigi, I love SMG3.

Meggy: She‚Äôs gotten better! Still has mixed opinions in the fanbase, but has changed. One problem I have is the amount of trauma and callbacks to that trauma they do. Just give my girl a break already. She needs therapy. What I like is that they‚Äôre not afraid to make her looney besides being a role model. They commit to her being a coach, which is also a plus.

Tari: A girl who sadly gets drawn to the background. I would love to see an episode with her and Melony. She‚Äôs still sweet, but again, do something with her.

Melony: Idek if she exists still. At this point, a lot of characters becoming backgrounds. They bring back for one episode, but then leave them hanging. Like with X and FM or Saiko. Who‚Äôs next!

Saiko: They did her dirty too. It always seems like in movies, they forget that her and Melony exist? They leave Melony out for OP reasons, but why Saiko? She can come in handy in some cases. Give her more screentime.

Luigi: Another favorite of mine. Guy has flower shop, being an older brother to Mario, and living his life. I feel like he‚Äôs everything that SMG4 is suppose to be, but isn‚Äôt. Besides being a coward, he is able to stick up himself now. On the other hand, stop making him a punching bag :(

Bob: Same ole Bob. I guess he‚Äôs more risky now?

Boopkins: Just why. I don‚Äôt hate this kid, but he contributes little to nothing. He‚Äôs there for comic relief and that‚Äôs all. 

Mario: He‚Äôs gotten better too :D He‚Äôs still silly but gained a self-awareness. He‚Äôs caring, goofy, and what the avatar should be. And he‚Äôs not afraid to call people out. I really appreciate the writers for doing this, because his character might‚Äôve been in trouble last year. 

Karen: She‚Äôs just a mom, but with a backstory. She‚Äôs tough and willing to do anything for her kids. Her and smg4‚Äôs dynamic is unexpected.

Mr. Puzzles: I watched the movie and I wasn‚Äôt happy about either. It was great, but yikes. Even when they want to redeem him, they know it won‚Äôt sit well. Especially with how much he committed. He‚Äôs still selfish and has revenge on his mind, but probably wants to work on it. Ima give him a chance!

WPNZ: They improved him. He cares for Toomp and sees him as his own. Even with being a machine and criminal, he still has a heart. He knows he wasn‚Äôt a good father, but doesn‚Äôt want to forget his family. He can maybe interact with the crew someday.

**Entry Number 1 - The Time Machine**

**Adventurer's Log - Sean Almond**

Ah yes! What a day it has been! To think that only a few moments ago I was at home, tinkering away in my garage - the floor littered with empty bags of chips and an assortment of toppled-over coffee mugs; the brown nectar on which I so frequently overdose, spilled and stained across the dusty floor. But now, as I grip this steering wheel with whitening knuckles, I can't help but feel my heart race inside my chest. The sheer exhilaration painting a Cheshire-cat grin across my face. If you could see me right now, you'd think me a bit mad but you see, for years I have toiled away in obscurity; the last in a family with 3 boys who all went on to follow in our father's footsteps and pursue a life in sports - rugby specifically. Ignored I was - or rather, I still am. It was the price to pay for having a brilliant mind - a mind drawn to the sciences and the pursuit of knowledge rather than to testosterone-fuelled frenzies and the collision of bodies - all in pursuit of a ball. Ha! I never truly understood the concept to be honest. 30 grown men, chasing one ball to the thunderous applause of a cheering audience.

As I turn the corner, my center console suddenly lights up, revealing Priscilla's freckled face, her demeanour steady yet unsure. Classic Priscilla. Always second-guessing herself.

""M-Mr Almond,"" she stammers, raising a bony hand and with a bitten-nail, lightly pushing her glasses up the bridge of her pointed nose.

""Yes, Priscilla... is everything alright?"" the words escape my mouth. Traffic grinds to a halt and I ease on the brakes, bringing my car to a standstill. Outside, the sky is overcast - adorned with the usual gloomy grey clouds that we've all grown accustomed to here in England.

""I don't know how to tell you this..."" she hesitantly continues, lowering her gaze away from the camera. Immediately, I can sense something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong.

""Priscilla... what did we say about important information..."" I press in. If there's two things I never want supressed - it's my coffee and potentially life-changing knowledge.

I can see Priscilla wrestle with her shyness as she finally manages to tear her eyes up from the floor and glance back into the camera.

""Mr Harris said it's time to pay you a visit... he's left the campus with a team and they're headed over to your house this instant...""

My Jaw drops. That weasel! 

""Mr Almond?"" I can hear Priscialla's quaking voice from somewhere in the backdrop - her voice reduced to a distant echo, drowned out by the loud throbbing of my temple. Beads of sweat start to form at my forehead, my palms inadvertently slip along the circumference of the steering wheel.

""Mr Almond... is there anything I can d...""

""N-no, that's quite alright, thank you Priscilla. I'll be in touch,"" I quickly respond, leaning forward and swiping the video call away. 

Tom Harrison! That fiend! When I started my Time Travel project, he had assured me I would have his full support. But instead, he proceeded to back-bite me to the board, painting me as ""insane"" and a whole host of other unflattering accusations. I only know this because thankfully, Priscilla serves them their tea in the meetings when they have these discussions. Even though she's Harrison's assistant, I suppose her conscience had weighed heavy on her, to the point where she would alert me of anything untoward said about me. And after a sustained campaign spanning the course of many-many-many months, I suppose Harrison's plan had reached its crescendo! But to what effect? Are they planning on presenting me with resignation papers at my home and cajoling me into signing without stirring up a media frenzy for the good of the company like what they did to the previous Chief Technology Officer? Whatever it is, I won't be sticking around to find out!

 After an illegal about-turn, I floored the pedal of my sports sedan - streaking it back in the direction of my home like a rocket. I weaved and meandered my way in and out of traffic, the loud sound of incessant honking trailing me in the wake of my escape as I tore down the highway. 

Heart drumming, I skid to a halt beside the pavement outside my quaint, nondescript, bare-brick house, the sleepy neighbourhood quiet as a cemetery. Wasting no time, I dash up my driveway and scamper toward the garage, pulling the garage door up just as the sound of roaring engines echoes from down the street. Rounding on my spot, I cast a quick glance down the road. In the distance, I see Harrison's car, leading two others and a van toward my house, the convoy racing with urgency.

""So he's even brought a camera crew has he?"" I mumble, marching into my garage and rounding on my spot before dragging the door shut. I waste no time - turn on my heel and head for the lights, flicking on the fluorescent bulbs, hanging overhead. The cramped space is lined with a series of wooden tables, each pressed against the wall while a chalkboard with all my calculations is mounted up on the wall. In the center of the space, rising up toward the ceiling like a tower of shimmering brilliance, my machine stands tall - a testament to ingenuity and the power of quantum mechanics! The steel structure, with multiple cylindrical cores affixed to its sides and a singular round window, fastened atop the door to the chamber, stands waiting for me - looming like a watchtower calling out to lost sailors at sea. 

""Sean! Sean, I know you're in there!"" I hear Harrison's booming voice, calling from outside the shut door.

""What do you want, you snake!? Come to sack me have you?!"" I shout in response, hurrying toward one of the nearby tables and picking up one of my diaries. It's a little black book in which I've scrawled my research about Vampire myths around the world. 

""West Africa, here I come,"" I whisper beneath my breath, gleaning at a drawing of the infamous creature known as the Adze that I scrawled months earlier onto the page. Ever since I was a young boy, myths and tales have always intrigued me and what better way to discover whether they were true or not, than by building a time machine and journeying through history to see for oneself?

""DARN IT, ALMOND! OPEN UP THIS INSTANT!"" Harrison's voice is accompanied by loud banging, reverberating along the steel of the garage door. ""There is a chance your machine doesn't do what you think it does!""

""NONSENSE!"" I reply, slipping the diary into my inner trench-coat pocket and stepping toward the machine. I immediately reach for the lever and pull it down, the whizzing of the cores stirring up and echoing through the entire space. I watch in awe as bright, pulsating lights begin to race up and down the cylinders, the ringing of the steel drowning out Harrison's spirited protests. As I plant a boot forward toward the machine, I reach for the door to the chamber - a sudden implosion pulling me in, before thrusting me outward - the explosion of spiralling air and particles engulfing my entire garage in a blinding haze.

Everything fades to black.

1my9hol,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my9hol,Some Recent Recipes and Reviews,"This community has helped inject so much fun into my dinner planning ‚Äî so thank you! I thought I would similarly share some of my own recent meals with my thoughts and reviews. Some are recipes often recommended here and others were found perusing the app. I will comment with links below:

1.) Slow Cooker Chipotle Honey Chicken Tacos - tasty! I will probably still experiment to find a better recipe but will definitely keep this in my back pocket, especially since it was so easy to make. The pickled onions were particularly good and will be a staple for any taco in the future.  Score: 7.5/10

2.) Cardamom Coffee Banana Bread - similar sentiment as above. I‚Äôm glad I tried it because it was good, but there are better banana bread recipes imo. I also think the cardamom flavor was too muted, but I‚Äôm also a cardamom fiend. Score 7.5/10

3.) Smashed Beef Kebabs - Loved this one. I thought the raisins and pine nuts (a suggested substitute) were an unnecessary topping and won‚Äôt bother again. However, the syrup (I used date instead of pomegranate ‚Äî another suggested substitute) was a must. Served with homemade pita. Will make again. Score 8/10

4.) Scallion and Celery Quiche - Made this with a toddler clinging to my leg so apologies if it isn‚Äôt the prettiest. It was interesting but I probably won‚Äôt make it again. If I did, I would probably experiment with different cheeses and maybe up the scallion amount. Score 6.5/10

5.) Turmeric-Black Pepper Chicken With Asparagus - I actually made this before it went viral on Reddit and was very much underwhelmed. I will grant that it was easy to make, but so is charcuterie dinner and that is much tastier. Score 5/10.

6.) Smashed Chicken Burgers With Cheddar and Parsley - Another disappointment. I was so excited for these and waited so long to make them since my husband is madman who does not like cheese. An evening he was away, I LUNGED at the chance, even though I was at my mom‚Äôs and her catalog of recipes is second to none. Total mistake. The burgers were bland and the avocado and chunks of cheddar cheese in mayo salad was so strange ‚Äî and rereading just now I see that the chunks of cheddar and avocado were actually just in lime juice and mustard but it genuinely tasted like mayo salad so take that as you will. Score 4/10

7.) Avgolemono Chicken Soup With Gnocchi
- Loved. Heavenly. As you can see, I used pasta instead of gnocchi (or rice) since we were moving and I was trying to empty the pantry. I am half tempted to make it again with the actual gnocchi but also half not because why mess with perfection? The dill was a delight so don‚Äôt skimp on it (that said, I‚Äôm a dill fiend as well). Score 10/10

8.) Corn and Miso Pasta Salad - Another ‚Äúglad I made it, but won‚Äôt bother again.‚Äù I think if I were to retool the recipe, I would try a miso and butter sauce, since mixing it with hot sauce and mayo gave it a distinctive ‚Äúevery third restaurant‚Äôs special sauce‚Äù aftertaste and the miso flavor was lost. Score: 6/10

9.) Roasted Gochujang Cabbage - yeah. Well. Hmmm. How to begin? So, if you read the directions, you have to get the sheet pan very hot before the cabbage goes on it. I did that. My pan was glistening with the heat of a Martian desert. It was perfect. And so, I put this wonderfully hot pan on a silicone trivet and beautifully arranged the cabbage and put it in the oven and danced like Snow White because I had a pretty new apron . . . And then there was smoke. Like, crazy smoke. The fire alarm went off. The toddler needs to be ushered into a different room kind of smoke. 

Friends, the silicone trivet had stuck to the bottom of the pan and had melted in my 450 degree oven. The fire alarm went off for half an hour. Which may not sound like a lot, but it‚Äôs A LOT. I also ended up taking my daughter outside for a walk while the room aired out, and I could hear the alarm blocks away. 

Anyway, I tried this Gojuchang cabbage cold and after twenty plus minutes of standing on a chair waving a kitchen towel at one of the three raging smoke alarms, so perhaps this review is just a tad biased. But it was thoroughly subpar for earning the lifelong enmity of my neighbors and spending 45 minutes scraping semi-hard silicone goo off the oven floor. Score: NA

10.) Garlicky, Smoky Grilled London Broil With Chipotle Chiles - I made this with the Gochujang cabbage. I had never made this cut of meat before and was a little nervous, but I found it delightful ‚Äî especially considering how easy and (relatively) cheap it was. After feeling like a total failure with my cabbage crisis, this helped me get some of my bruised mojo back. Will make again.  Score: 8/10

11.) I saved the best for last ‚Äî the Beet Salad With Celery and Pomegranate. So, I am a salad girlie. A person who once got a Sweetgreen membership because it actually made financial sense kind of salad girlie. So when I say this salad is amazing, it‚Äôs truly amazing. I subbed unripe nectarines for the pomegranate seeds, per a reviewer‚Äôs suggestion, and it was the perfect combo ‚Äî the taste and crunch were heavenly. I also added pan-fried chickpeas for protein. No need to say I‚Äôll make this again because I already made it again. Just perfect. Score: 11/10.

TLDR: Love this sub and thank you to all who make it a great place. Don‚Äôt use silicone trivets. Make the beet salad.

1my9h1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1my9h1d/rf_brothers/,[RF] Brothers,"Mattias hobbled through the hallway of the brightly lit apartment complex, coming to a stop in front of the most normal door he had ever seen. Nothing could be less noteworthy than this plain, beige door. He had passed some doors adorned with wreaths, some with fancy, custom numbers, and even one with a skateboarding sticker on it. The apartment was, for all intents and purposes, a very calm and friendly environment. Every door seemed to tell a story about the inhabitants who lay behind it. And then there was this non-threatening, boring door.

And yet as Mattias stood in front of the unremarkable door, he noticed just how much he had been sweating. Sure, Mattias and his brother Jon sent each other funny posts on instagram a couple times each week, but they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in person for almost three years now. And they only lived two hours away from each other. It had been a long three years. 

Mattias took a deep breath and knocked on the door. From inside he heard a quiet rustle, the sound a child makes as they sneak past their parents room past their bedtime. Mattias knocked again, this time nothing. He rolled his eyes and knocked a third time.

‚ÄúJon, it‚Äôs me, c‚Äômon‚Äù he yelled. Now he heard a rush of movement, like one would hear from a squirrel they surprised as it rushed into the bushes. The sound of the flurry approached the door, and suddenly it flew open.

‚ÄúMattias!‚Äù Jon said, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just came to visit,‚Äù Mattias replied, ‚Äúcan I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYa ya, of course,‚Äù Jon moved out of the doorframe and waved Mattias in. Mattias entered and Jon closed the door. The two boys stood in silence trying to figure out what came next. They both awkwardly settled with a quick hug paired with a couple of pats on the back.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been awhile,‚Äù Jon said as they retracted from the hug, ‚Äúcan I get you anything to eat? I just put away dinner so it‚Äôs still relatively fresh, some pasta.‚Äù 

Mattias nodded, ‚ÄúYa I‚Äôm actually pretty hungry.‚Äù Jon pointed to a stool beside the island counter in the kitchen. Mattias started towards it and almost immediately tripped over a heavy bag laid haphazardly on the floor. He muttered the first obscenity that popped into his mouth as he caught himself. 

‚ÄúOh watch out,‚Äù Jon said, ‚ÄúI keep my work bag there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh ya of course, just in the middle of the floor.‚Äù Mattias replied jokingly.

Jon chuckled, ‚ÄúI always remember it‚Äôs there.‚Äù He looked down and noticed Mattias‚Äô ankle brace. ‚ÄúWhat happened to your ankle?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI got tripped on Saturday,‚Äù Matias replied, ‚Äúbuddy came outta nowhere and stuck his stick right under my blade.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs a dirty move.‚Äù Jon said as he opened his fridge and took out a large Tupperware container. Mattias peaked inside the fridge to see if there was anything else he could ask for, but to his surprise it was almost empty. Save for some produce, some condiments, a couple other tupperware containers, and a case of hard seltzers, the fridge was just cold space. Jon grabbed a plate from the cabinet, one of four plates Mattias noticed, and started scooping food out of the container onto the plate.

‚ÄúYou think? Ref didn‚Äôt see it so I had to go at him myself, all with a busted ankle.‚Äù

Jon stopped plating and turned around. ‚ÄúAnd how‚Äôd that go?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDo you even have to ask? Bud, I got him outta there. I stiffed him, pulled his sweater over his head, and tossed him,‚Äù Mattias replied as he acted out the motions of the fight. Both brothers laughed as Mattias sat down and Jon returned to making the food.

He put the plate in the microwave and looked over his shoulder, ‚ÄúYou want some garlic toast too?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Mattias answered. While his brother got to work making the toast, Mattias looked around at the small apartment. He couldn‚Äôt help but smile, it looked just like if you had taken Jon‚Äôs tiny room from their childhood home and just expanded it to fit in a living room and kitchen. The brothers had spent a lot of time in that room together, playing with toys as kids, video games as teens. They barely fit in that room past the age of 9. On the wall were a couple shelves with a bunch of random knick knacks on them. Lego sets, some action figures, a couple of books, some very old baseball trophies, all caked in a noticeable amount of dust. The living room was simple. In the middle sat a barely used couch with a barren coffee table in front of it, pointed at a decade old flatscreen TV. And in the corner, Jon‚Äôs iconic desk. Complete with his gaming computer and the usual mess of papers, pencils and empty seltzer cans littered on top and around it. Funny, it was all the same stuff as that claustrophobic bedroom, but now all the same stuff barely took up any space. The room was almost empty. Just then the microwave beeped, which snapped Mattias back to reality. He suddenly became aware of some cheering going on down the hallway. ‚ÄúParty going on?‚Äù he asked Jon.

Jon grabbed a dishcloth and took the now piping hot food and plate out of the microwave. ‚ÄúOh ya, the building's super is retiring so they're throwing a farewell party for him,‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúNot invited?‚Äù Mattias joked.

‚ÄúMeh,‚Äù Jon replied, ‚ÄúI left a case of beer outside his door earlier with a card, I‚Äôm sure he got it.‚Äù Jon laid the pasta and garlic toast in front of Mattias along with a fork. ‚ÄúBon appetit.‚Äù

Mattias dug in, he was truly quite hungry. And he did always enjoy his brothers cooking. He paused for a second after the first couple bites. The pasta sauce was almost exactly like their mother‚Äôs sauce, just with some carrots, broccoli and celery mixed in.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù Jon asked in between bites.

‚ÄúToo much broccoli,‚Äù was Mattias‚Äô review.

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Jon said, rolling his eyes, ‚Äúit‚Äôll make you strong.‚Äù Jon sat across from his brother with a glass of water. The two sat in silence, eating and sipping away while avoiding direct eye contact. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶. how bout them ‚ÄòNucks eh?‚Äù Mattias finally said to break the silence. The two brothers stared at each other for a few seconds, then they both burst out laughing. Back when they were younger, they would say that line as a joke to each other when they encountered awkward silences in conversations with strangers. It brought them both back. 

‚ÄúRemember when we were getting haircuts that one time,‚Äù Mattias said between laughs, ‚Äúand the barber asked you a question that you didn‚Äôt hear or something. So from my chair I said ‚ÄòSo how bout them ‚ÄòNucks eh‚Äô?‚Äù

Jon slapped the table with his hand. ‚ÄúYa while he was shaving my head. And then I ended up shooting my head forward and getting a huge line shaved down the middle of my head.‚Äù He said, tears streaming down his face while he laughed. ‚ÄúI ended up having to get a buzz cut, the day before class pictures too.‚Äù As he laughed, Mattias watched Jon get lost in his thoughts as he remembered what happened after they got home that day. Jon wiped tears off his cheek, ‚ÄúOh man, it‚Äôs been a while since I laughed that hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh right‚Äù Mattias said as he caught himself and took a deep breath. ‚ÄúRemember when‚Ä¶‚Äù he began, recounting another story from their shared childhood. Both brothers took turns trading ‚Äòremember when‚Äô stories for an hour. The more they talked, the more they began to slip back into their old brotherly slang and inside jokes. They became more and more comfortable with each other's presence. Even still, everyone once in a while one of the two would get uncomfortably lost in a memory, or would awkwardly leave out a part of a story. Neither brother brought it up.

Eventually Jon stood up and poured himself a glass of water. ‚ÄúRemember when we used to stay up late past our bedtime and look at stars through that telescope you got for Christmas?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were always ‚Äòlooking for Uranus‚Äô‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh, right? So funny.‚Äù Mattias chuckled while he replied. 

‚ÄúWhat happened to that telescope?‚Äù Jon asked. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember.‚Äù 

Mattias looked away and scratched his head. ‚ÄúMom caught me up late one night and threw the telescope off the balcony, I had to throw it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, I didn‚Äôt know that.‚Äù Jon said. He pushed his glasses up his nose with his pointer finger and started twiddling his thumbs. He looked over and saw Mattias biting at a hangnail on his thumb. From his chair, Jon could feel the vibrations of Mattias rapidly bouncing his leg up and down. Suddenly, the brothers were back to awkward strangers. They looked anywhere but at each other. They sat across from one another, waiting for the other to make the first move. It was like the games of chicken they used to play on their bikes. But instead of wild and dangerous laughter, it was bitter and sad silence.
Mattias broke first.

‚ÄúMom‚Äôs doing well these days.‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ nice. I‚Äôm glad.‚Äù Jon replied.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs stopped drinking, mostly.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh wow. Good for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should come visit, yknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust work and stuff. I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMom misses you.‚Äù

Jon scoffed. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell she does.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou remember when I moved out, she said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt you ever show your ungrateful fucking face here ever again‚Äô. And now you‚Äôre going to tell me she misses me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs unfair. It was a bad day for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better this way.‚Äù

Mattias and Jon both started to speak much louder.

‚ÄúThis is so classic you,‚Äù Mattias said, just under a yell, ‚Äúyou avoid the problem, you never make an effort.‚Äù

Jon matched his tone. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one out here making an effort, she isn‚Äôt. When are you going to realize we owe her nothing?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs our mom Jon!‚Äù Mattias yelled.

‚ÄúThat makes it worse!‚Äù Jon yelled back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right what she did to us! Getting away from her was the best thing I ever did!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt just leave her!‚Äù Mattias snapped. Tears began streaming down his eyes. ‚ÄúAll those fucking plans we made over the years? Nothing. No camping, no summer job together. We always talked about how‚Äôd we go to bars and clubs together, and you weren‚Äôt even fucking there when I turned 19!‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you to come with me! We could've both gotten away!‚Äù Jon said.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between my mom and my brother!‚Äù Mattias cried. ‚ÄúI mean fuck, man. You think the last three years have been a great time for me since you ran out? It‚Äôs all on me now, no one has my back!‚Äù He put his elbows on the table and bowed his head between his hands, gripping some of his hair in each hand. He sobbed loudly.

Jon was going to say something, but he bit his tongue. He stood up and walked over to his brother and began patting his back. With his other hand he wiped tears off his cheek. 
Mattias began to calm down, he took long, deep breaths. 

‚ÄúYou need to come visit, Jon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYa ok, I will.‚Äù Jon said. He grabbed a napkin from the table and blew his nose. ‚ÄúI might be able to next Thursday. Just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt tell mom ahead of time please.‚Äù

1my9g9v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my9g9v,Basil Seed Thresher 2.0,"It‚Äôs a new year, and with my basil crop coming in hot, I felt the irresistible compulsion to make a bigger, better seed thresher than I made last year. Why this motivates me, I‚Äôll never know‚Ä¶

This year‚Äôs version is¬†*bigger and better*! And by bigger, I mean smaller, and by better, I actually do mean better. If you think it looks suspiciously like a manual coffee grinder, don‚Äôt be fooled! ‚Ä¶Well okay, it basically is, but with some key modifications to make it less grindy and more threshy.

Functionally, it‚Äôs simple: I add basil pods in the top, turn the finger crank, and out the bottom come seeds and husks. There‚Äôs some mechanical mumbo jumbo happening in between, but that‚Äôs not really important.

The big upgrade this year is an adjustment option! I can twist the top section to set the spacing between the inner and outer burrs. Too tight and I get aromatic seed powder, too loose and I‚Äôm just moving intact pods from top to bottom. However, once I found the right middle ground, the seeds separated cleanly and without damage.

¬†This also¬†*should*¬†make it usable for other seed types.... In theory‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a solid theory I promise, but I‚Äôm leaving the experimental confirmation of that to others if they are interested.

Next on my to do list is a trommel-style cleaner to separate seed from chaff. Last year I tried to combine threshing and cleaning in one tool, but it wasn‚Äôt very effective or adjustable. This time I‚Äôm making it a dedicated tool. Ideally it will be compact, adjustable for different seeds, and fully 3D printed. After that, I‚Äôll revisit my seed sorter. I built one last year that worked well, but it was big, tricky to print, and over complicated to operate.

You might reasonably ask, ‚ÄúWhy is any of this necessary?‚Äù And the obvious answer is that it‚Äôs not. But I relax and have fun designing and making things like this, and that‚Äôs reason enough for me.",18,1755974560.0,functionalprint,3,1.0,False

(23M this side)

I've been thinking for a while that it would be nice to have a small, safe, and fun meetup just for us boys here in Jaipur. 

Sometimes it feels like we don't get enough spaces where we can just relax, share experiences, and make new friends without any pressure.

So, I thought why not post here and see if anyone else would be interested?

Idea for the Meetup: 
1) A casual hangout. (somewhere central and safe like place everyone feels comfortable).

2) Could be coffee, snacks, or even a lunch/dinner depending on what time works for most of us.

3) The main goal is just to meet like-minded women, share stories, maybe vent about life, studies, work, or just have fun conversations.

ü•ÖWhy boys Only? Because sometimes we just need that safe, chill, and supportive environment where we can open up without hesitation. Also, it's a great way to build a small community of men friends in Jaipur.

What Next? -If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me:) -No pressure at all just come with good vibes. -Even if only 3-4 of us show up, it'll still be worth it! üòé

I know meeting new people can feel a bit awkward at first, but honestly, it could turn out to be a really fun and memorable experience.

1my9enj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1my9enj/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_meet_my_exs_baby_mama_on/,AITAH for not wanting to meet my ex‚Äôs baby mama on her terms?,"My partner and I met shortly after he broke things off with his on and off ex of 10 years. We got engaged within 6 months and have been together 5 years and have 2 kids (1 & 3). He also has a 7 year old daughter with his ex. 

The back story. My partner had bought a house when he thought he had finally broken up with his ex for good but one day she showed up with her suitcase claiming she could no longer live with her mom and never left. She quit her job, racked up 10k in debt which my partner paid off, then she got pregnant and that was that. He stuck around for their daughter but ultimately did not want to be with the mom. She kept his house which he still pays the mortgage for and hasn‚Äôt worked a day in her life since claiming disability for slipping on black ice. She doesn‚Äôt have a car much less a license, so it‚Äôs my partner who drops off and picks up his daughter from school every day and takes her to all her after school clubs. Which understandably he‚Äôs the dad, but this woman does nothing all day and that means I‚Äôm the one doing everything with my kids while my partner is with his daughter. It was rocky from the start as she never accepted that he moved on. She would withhold his daughter from him at times and she was not allowed to sleep over at our place because ‚Äòhe ruined their family by leaving‚Äô. 

When I was pregnant with our second, my partner hadn‚Äôt told her right away. I‚Äôm part of a crochet group on FB and I‚Äôd posted a photo of an outfit I‚Äôd made to fit my pregnant belly (no face). That same day my partner got home and asked me why I was posting online because his ex had found the post and was furious. So this woman is searching my name on FB god knows how many times because my profile is locked and the only thing she found was a post I made that day to a public group. Up till then she was the one refusing to meet me. So fast forward my son is born and she‚Äôs messaging my partner telling him how hurt she is that he had another kid and she is beyond upset that she can‚Äôt give her daughter anymore siblings because she‚Äôs too old now (she‚Äôs a year older than me). Another time she sent a photo to him of herself at the hospital getting a check up. And she‚Äôs constantly arguing with him about how she feels that he left her. When our son was 6 months, she told my partner that she‚Äôs uncomfortable with me breastfeeding our son in my own home in front of her daughter (she made it about her daughter but I later found out it was her). 

After 5 years she has finally suggested we meet. Her suggestion was for me to bring my kids to a playground to play with her daughter while my partner watched the kids and we talk (The siblings get along great and have a great relationship). I counter suggested just meeting for coffee on our own without dragging the kids. Haven‚Äôt heard back yet.

1my9ed6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1my9ed6/dating_opportunities_in_india_as_a_34_m/,Dating opportunities in India as a 34 M,"I have been living in the US since last 9-10 years. With the latest political climate changes I am mentally preparing myself that I may have to return to India. I am very curious to understand what the dating opportunities are like in the metro cities for thirty plus males like myself. I am from the Delhi region but open to all metro cities within India. In the past couple of years during my short visits I have only connected with women over the apps and while a few felt like great personalities and attractive in general it still wasn't a big pool considering it was the just the apps. 

As someone who will most likely take a break from work and enjoy the re-adjustment period back in India, if dating was my first priority what are your suggestions? I will have the time to get to know someone properly. I have some financial cushion as a result of working abroad for these past years so I will be mostly focussed on traveling and dating really. Maybe building a side hustle if something interests me but not the main priority. I am also into spirituality and exploring deeper truths in life. Based on this vibe I'd appreciate inputs.

In the US I have stopped using the apps for a while now and meet women in person by asking out and setting up dates that way. Is this okay to try out in India too now? Randomly approaching women I mean. Or its frowned upon? When I say random it means at events, bars, coffee shops etc. 

I am not planning to get married for now, maybe ever. If it happens organically that I meet someone awesome and compatible I am all for it but not looking at it as a must have. Pretty comfortable and used to living alone.

1my9c64,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1my9c64/can_the_doss_soundbox_bluetooth_speaker_really/,Can the DOSS SoundBox Bluetooth Speaker Really Handle Outdoor Use?,"Testing out the DOSS SoundBox, I was genuinely intrigued by its hype surrounding portable Bluetooth speakers. The sleek, modern design grabbed my attention, and as someone who uses music for everything ‚Äì from setting the mood in my office to blasting it during spontaneous kitchen dance parties ‚Äì I knew this would be put through its paces. With a mix of high expectations and curiosity, here‚Äôs how it performed in day-to-day life.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was how compact yet sturdy this speaker feels. It‚Äôs small enough to fit on a coffee table but has a reassuring weight that screams durability. The black finish was elegant without looking overly flashy, easily blending into my office and living room setups. With a water-resistance rating of IPX5, splashes from a bathroom shower or accidental water spills during outdoor picnics weren‚Äôt a concern. The touch pad on top was a cool feature; it added a futuristic vibe and worked well with clean, dry fingers. Just avoid using it straight after washing dishes ‚Äì trust me on that.

**Ease of Use and Connectivity**  
Setting up the speaker was straightforward. Within seconds of powering it on, my smartphone paired effortlessly via Bluetooth 5.0. It reconnected automatically the next time, sparing me from the awkward ‚ÄúBluetooth hunting‚Äù ritual. Whether I used my laptop, tablet, or a good ol‚Äô auxiliary cable, the versatility of the connectivity options ensured I wasn‚Äôt tied to any specific device. I particularly appreciated the 33-foot Bluetooth range because I could roam around with my phone without worrying about losing the connection.

**Sound Quality and Performance**  
For such a compact device, the sound quality is impressive. The 12W stereo output with dual high-performance drivers made me double-check the price bracket. Bass was surprisingly rich, filling the room without overwhelming the mids or highs. It held up across genres, whether I was vibing to lo-fi hip-hop while working or cranking up techno beats for a pre-party boost. There were moments I wished for slightly crisper highs, but for the size and cost, this delivered way more than anticipated.

[Check DOSS SoundBox price on Amazon.](https://pasprog.com/p/b01cqov3yo/)

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery life was another area that pleasantly surprised me. Even with continuous usage, it lasted almost close to the promised 20 hours when played at medium volume. I took it for a weekend of hiking and picnicking, and it didn‚Äôt run out despite hours of use. Fully charging it took roughly three hours, which felt reasonable given the convenience it brought. The included micro USB cable worked perfectly, though I wish they‚Äôd shifted to USB-C for a more modern twist.

**Strengths**  
- Touch controls add a sleek, modern feel  
- Solid, durable design with water-resistance (IPX5)  
- Long-lasting 20-hour battery life suitable for travel or extended use  
- Impressive sound output with a powerful bass boost for its compact size  

**Critiques**  
- Touch sensitivity can falter if fingers are wet, slightly limiting usage scenarios like poolside parties  
- Lack of USB-C charging feels a bit dated in 2023 standards  
- High frequencies could be slightly more defined for audiophiles  

**Portability and Applications**  
One thing I loved was how adaptable this speaker was to different environments. I‚Äôve used it while working at my desk, cooking dinner, and even outdoors during a bonfire gathering. Its lightweight design (1.23 pounds), combined with a durable build, made it super easy to toss in a backpack. Whether you're hiking, just relaxing at home, or need music for an office party, this speaker brought energy to every scenario.

**Product Comparisons**  
Now, comparing this to some big names like JBL Flip 5 or Sony XB12, here‚Äôs where the DOSS SoundBox stands‚Äîit‚Äôs not your audiophile-grade speaker, but it delivers robust performance in areas that matter. The battery life trounces a few competitors, though products like JBL Flip offer a slightly wider soundstage. Against the Sony XB12, I found its touch controls a snazzy feature missing from the latter, though the Sony might win out in waterproofing with its IP67 rating. Here, the speaker balances affordability with functionality, proving itself as more than just another mid-budget option.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Pricing matters to everyone, myself included, and this Bluetooth speaker punches above its weight. It provides a lot of features for a fraction of the cost of premium brands. The robust sound quality, comfortable battery backup, and handy portability make it a worthwhile investment. While it‚Äôs not the absolute cheapest option out there, the value for what it offers is hard to overlook.

I went to a nearby gas station to get gas for my lawn mower. I went inside to piss and get a coffee. 
The coffee machine is right next to the bathrooms. As I was putting the lid on my coffee, this random woman comes running up with a stack of scratch-off tickets in her hand and two little kids in tow, probably 6-8 years old. She looks panicky, obviously in a mad rush to get to the bathroom. She locks eyes with me and says ""Heywillyouwarchmykidsforaminutewhileiusethebathroom"", and without slowing down or waiting for an answer, flies into the bathroom. 

Had she waited for an answer, it would've been ""No.""  I don't like kids. I don't watch my own siblings' kids, nevermind some random fucking stranger. Not my circus, not my monkeys. So I went to the register, paid for my coffee, and left. 

When I got home (a couple blocks away), I told my pseudo-girlfriend about it and she went berserk, screeching about ""what if someone would've took them"" and ""they could've walked out in the parking lot and got hit by a car"", and the eternally stupid old canard ""It takes a village"". Her argument is that *everyone* is responsible for all children, and mine is that I chose not to have children so i wouldn't *have* to be responsible for children. And, that the woman is the asshole for trying to foist her kids off on an unwilling stranger. 

So, am I the asshole here? 

EDIT: I want to be clear here, I don't feel i was responsible for those kids, because I never agreed to *accept* responsibility for them. If I had agreed to watch them and STILL walked off, then yeah, asshole. ",3,1755974097.0,AITAH,8,0.72,False

I tried using Ghost protein powder- the cafe latte flavor, and mixing it with hot espresso and pouring milk over it. Absolutely vile. I literally could NOT get it down. 

So I gave up, but today I remembered Premier Protein. These shakes have always been way too artificially sweet for me to drink, but what if I put espresso in it? It would dilute the sweetness.

So today I ordered 4 shots of blonde espresso, and put a whole caramel shake in there and topped it with a ton of ice so it‚Äôs extra cold (super important). It gave me like a 32 ounce drink, which is huge and super filling, and it literally tasted like the perfect caramel iced latte. This will absolutely be my new favorite drink.

Within the last few months I started having sudden urinary urgency and burning that came out of no where. It would come and go, as I‚Äôve been reading about flare ups it seems like maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm really big on supplements so when it started really bad I thought it was a UTI. I started taking garlic and ACV regularly. It seemed to go away until the next time it flared up. That continued every couple weeks. I made an appointment with CVS not realizing it was virtual and she prescribed macrobid without testing my urine. So after the macrobid didn‚Äôt help I went in person to an actual urgent care. She told me my dipstick came back negative. She gave me macrobid and they would call after the culture. The culture came back negative so I stoped the macrobid. But it did say there was genital flora detected in my urine. That‚Äôs when the urgent care doctor said I could have cystitis. 

I have a brand new PCP who I explained all this to and she is sending me for a pelvic ultrasound. She said that maybe I have a mass or cyst that‚Äôs pressing that could be causing this constant feeling. I don‚Äôt have pain at all it‚Äôs just a feeling in my urethra of having to go even tho I just went. 

It‚Äôs summer here where I live so I sweat a lot and I get dehydrated really easy so it‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm trying to constantly drink but also always sweating. I noticed triggers that make it worse are coffee and alcohol. So I‚Äôve been avoiding them. I mostly get the feeling in the morning and by afternoon it kind of goes away. 

I also ruled out other things it may be. I am not diabetic and I don‚Äôt have anxiety. I got a comprehensive blood work done. There was a couple concerns where my Ferritin is high, LDL cholesterol (max #100) mine is at 102, and my testosterone is 82. I was wondering if there is some correlation between those numbers and the urination frequency. She also is looking into PCOS.

1my96bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1my96bd/evaluate_teivio_trash_bags_for_mini_bins_are_they/,Evaluate Teivio Trash Bags for Mini Bins Are They Worth It,"Garbage bags may not immediately seem like the kind of product deserving of a deep dive review, but the Teivio 220-0.5 Gallon mini trash bags proved surprisingly intriguing after daily use in various settings. A product that initially comes across as straightforward has a lot more going for it‚Äîand, admittedly, a few quirks that caught my attention during testing. Whether you need something for your small trash bin, pet cleanups, or even as a quick solution for desk waste, these miniature marvels seem to promise plenty.

**Compact Design and Material Strength**  
The first thing you‚Äôll notice about these mini trash bags is their diminutive size. Specifically designed for small cans with a capacity of 0.5 gallons or two liters, they fit tiny bins seamlessly without any awkward excess material bunching up. I used them for the bathroom, car, and even a desktop trash can, and it felt as though the bags were custom-made for these purposes. Made from HDPE material, they deliver on durability despite their lightweight feel. I've stretched them close to their limits with heavier trash items, and there were no tears or unexpected mishaps. The star-seal bottom also deserves special mention for providing reliable leak protection. No one likes a mess at the bottom of their trash can, and this feature ensures that doesn‚Äôt happen.  

**Daily Convenience and Usability**  
What I appreciated most about these clear plastic bags is how effortlessly they integrated into my everyday routines. At home, I found myself tossing coffee grounds, used tissues, and bits of paper into a tiny trash bin lined with one of these bags. Their transparency is a nice touch too, especially if you like to separate recyclables or simply monitor what‚Äôs inside at a glance. Meanwhile, their roll design makes them easy to store; I‚Äôve kept one roll in my kitchen drawer, another in the car for cleanup emergencies, and a third in the bathroom cabinet. The convenience factor is incredibly high.  

[Check Teivio 220-0.5 Gallon Mini Trash Bag price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0982ngx2j/)  

**Multi-purpose Versatility**  
These mini trash bags are not just for trash cans‚Äîthey‚Äôre surprisingly versatile. While their intended use shines in bathrooms, bedrooms, and small kitchens, they also work well for pet waste disposal. During testing, I used them for cleaning up after my friend‚Äôs overly enthusiastic Labrador, and they handled the task without any problem. Beyond that, I‚Äôve also found them useful for car trash, containing everything from fast-food wrappers to stray receipts. It‚Äôs this versatility that kept surprising me every day; I even stashed one in my bag during a recent road trip, where it came in handy more times than I thought possible.

**Positives**  
The sheer practicality of these bags stood out during usage.  
- Compact size that fits even the smallest bins perfectly.  
- Durability despite their lightweight feel.  
- Multipurpose usability that extends beyond just trash bins.  

**Negatives**  
That said, there are a few aspects buyers might want to consider.  
- Their small capacity is limiting for those with larger waste needs.  
- Though sufficient for most light trash, these aren‚Äôt designed for wet or excessively heavy items.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these mini bags against competitors like the Amazon Basics small garbage bags highlighted both their strengths and weaknesses. While Amazon Basics trash bags come with similar durability and leak-proof promises, Teivio bags shine in versatility thanks to their compact size and roll-style packaging. However, Amazon Basics slightly edges out with their availability of scented options, which some might prefer for certain uses like bathrooms or diaper disposal. Meanwhile, the Glad Small Trash Bag range is another competitor offering reinforced bottom seams, but their price point tends to be somewhat higher, making Teivio the more cost-effective choice for everyday applications.

**Price Performance**  
The Teivio mini trash bags represent fantastic financial value for anyone in need of practical and efficient small garbage liners. Given that you get 250 bags in a single pack, there‚Äôs a clear bang-for-the-buck factor in play. Each bag essentially costs just pennies, which is perfect if you go through trash bags frequently. When you pair that with excellent durability and leak prevention, it‚Äôs hard to argue against their cost-effectiveness. Needless to say, they easily fit into my budget-conscious lifestyle while delivering reliable, daily performance.

‚ÄúI lost my child in silence‚Äîwhile my husband held another woman‚Äôs hand.‚Äù
Claudine Hogan gave up her thriving career as an auctioneer to be Damian Barrette‚Äôs perfect wife.
In return, she got cold indifference, his spoiled daughter‚Äôs scorn, and his secretary Lindsay Powell waiting to take her place.
When Claudine nearly died alone in the hospital, she finally walked away. On the stage of a high-profile charity auction, she reclaimed the voice he tried to silence‚Äîraising millions with her brilliance.
Now Damian scrambles to control what he already lost. But Claudine has more than money: old friends, a career reborn, and the chance to return to her long-abandoned PhD.
The man who thought she couldn‚Äôt live without him is about to find out‚Äîshe thrives without him.

Chapter 1
The day Claudine Hogan learned of her husband's betrayal, she underwent an abortion all by herself.
She had zero visitors during her hospital stay. Even on the day of her discharge, she was still alone. Though the doctor said she was recovering well, the excruciating agony of losing her flesh and blood still tore through her.
With sunglasses masking the fatigue in her eyes, she left the hospital.
Back at home, she headed straight to the second-floor bedroom.
Everything in the room looked the same, which meant Damian Barrette hadn't returned in her absence.
But she no longer gave a damn about whose bed he was in.
She was exhausted.
After taking some sleeping pills, she finally drifted into sleep.
But a nightmare soon seized her, dragging her back to that day a week ago. The spreading pool of blood beneath her, and the call that never went through...
""My baby!""
Jolted awake from the nightmare, Claudine opened her eyes, only to see the familiar bedroom.
She stared blankly at the ceiling for what felt like ages.
A heart-wrenching pain shot from her lower abdomen to her heart, then spread through her entire body.
There came a knock on the door. Before she could respond, the door was pushed open.
""Mrs. Barrette, Mr. Barrette called. He's coming back tonight and expects dinner to be ready before that,"" said the maid, Angie Hammond.
Claudine blinked back her tears.
""I'm not feeling well. Tell the kitchen staff to handle it,"" she replied, her voice hoarse.
Then she turned over and faced the other way.
But Angie wouldn't leave her alone.
Approaching the bed, she persuaded, ""Come on. Miss Barrette loves your cooking, and Mr. Barrette seldom comes back. You should seize the opportunity to win them over!""
She extended her hand, wanting to pull Claudine up.
Claudine frowned and shoved her away.
""I'm not a maid. Haven't I made myself clear? I don't want to cook today!""
She pointed at the room door and snapped, ""Get out!""
Angie widened her eyes in disbelief, clearly taken aback by her outburst.
Taking a step back, she withdrew her hand, muttering with disdain, ""Yeah, yeah. Keep making a scene and taking it out on me.
""The moment Mr. Barrette comes back, you'll be crawling back to him like always.""
She didn't intend to keep her voice down, and Claudine heard every word she said loud and clear.
Even Angie‚Äîthe maid‚Äîknew she always attended to Damian's every need when he returned, just so he could pay a little bit more attention to her.
But he had always despised her.
Their marriage was never about love‚Äîonly an alliance between two socially matched families. Damian required a trophy wife to complete his facade, and his daughter, Darlene Barrette, needed a woman to play the part of mother. That was all...
Claudine curled up into a ball, clutching her flat lower abdomen.
Today, she just wanted to be a grieving woman who had just lost her baby...
The sleeping pills kicked in, and she drifted to sleep again.
When she woke, she heard the sound of rustling.
Damian soon got on top of her, kissing her overbearingly while stripping her robe away.
Classic him‚Äînever once considering her feelings.
""Don't touch me...""
She pressed her hands against his chest, trying to push him away.
But lust had fogged his reasoning, and he mistook her resistance for invitation.
He clutched her slender wrists, pinned them above her head, and silenced her with another kiss.
Ashamed by the position, she turned her face away, dodging it.
A hint of displeasure flickered in Damian's eyes. Realizing Claudine wasn't faking it, he was no longer in the mood.
He wouldn't stoop so low as to force himself on her.
He rolled off her body, got out of bed, grabbed the robe, and loosely tied it around his waist. Then he sat on the chaise lounge by the window and lit a cigarette.
Chapter 2
Claudine's robe was already in disarray. She sat up, fumbled to adjust it, and spoke with determination, ""Damian, let's get a divorce!""
Damian blew out a smoke ring, his strikingly handsome face impassive.
""Divorce?""
He scoffed, as if she had told a joke.
""Claudine, what could you possibly do without me?""
His eyes swept over her, his gaze devoid of any emotion. Then he tapped the cigarette lightly, letting the ash fall onto the plush carpet.
""Seriously? Are you doing this because I took Darla abroad on a bonding trip?
""Angie said you had been away for a whole week until today. What? You're trying to protest by running away from home?""
Claudine let out a bitter laugh inwardly.
If it were a bonding trip as he claimed, why would he bring his secretary Lindsay Powell instead of her, his wife?
If it were before, she'd have brandished Lindsay's Instagram posts in his face, asking for an explanation.
But now, she felt it no longer necessary.
""I didn't feel well, so I stayed in the hospital this week,"" she replied calmly.
Just as she was about to tell him about the abortion, someone pushed the door open.
""You're awake, Claudine! I want those cookies you make!""
Darlene, in a pink nightgown, ran inside barefoot.
Claudine bent down and looked at her gently.
""Darla, I have something to say to Damian. How about we make cookies tomorrow?""
""No! I want them now!""
Having been pampered since childhood, Darlene was used to getting everything she wanted.
As Claudine was about to coax her, Damian cut in, ""Whatever it is can wait till tomorrow.
""Darla's been asking for your cookies on the way back today. Just go make some with her.""
Had it been before, Claudine would have agreed already. But she hadn't recovered from the abortion. How could she have the energy to take care of a five-year-old?
""I'm really not feeling well. And ... I wanna talk to you about our baby,"" she insisted.
Damian's face darkened immediately.
He impatiently stubbed out the cigarette butt in the ashtray and looked at her, his seemingly calm eyes tinged with faint fury.
""I've made myself very clear‚ÄîI don't want another baby!
""Your only job is to look after Darla.
""Don't get any ideas!""
He pulled out a card from his wallet and tossed it onto the table.
""Take this. Enough with the farce!""
With that, he strode out.
Perceptive from childhood, Darlene took a step back, distancing herself from Claudine.
""You upset Daddy again.
""What are you gonna do this time?""
She narrowed her eyes, the indifference and arrogance on her face identical to Damian's.
Then she stuck her tongue out at Claudine before bouncing out of the room.
Finally, quiet settled back into the bedroom once again.
A bone-chilling wind seeped through the window. Luxurious as the room was, it felt colder than a freezer.
Claudine glanced outside the window. Only scattered lights glimmered fitfully in the distance, almost devoured by the fathomless dark.
She then took out an invitation from her bag. An important auction in Bronzevale was around the corner, and she was invited to be the auctioneer.
Given the scale of the auction, Damian would surely attend.
He didn't allow her to work, so she hesitated to respond.
He used to be her entire world. For him, she had given up everything, including her career‚Äîthe one thing that she was most proud of.
But now...
What did he say earlier? Right‚Äî""Claudine, what could you possibly do without me?""
Fine. She'd prove exactly what she could accomplish without him!
Instead of resting properly after the abortion, Claudine endured a night of cold wind. Soon, she developed a high fever.
She drifted into sleep groggily but was soon startled awake by insistent pounding on the door.
Gritting her teeth, she forced her eyes open, the throbbing in her skull almost splitting her head in half.
Chapter 3
The sheets beside her didn't even have one single crease. She knew‚Äîonce again, Damian hadn't returned all night.
But she no longer cared.
In the next second, the room door was pushed open.
""This is Daddy's room.""
Darlene stepped in with Lindsay, neither of them realizing how rude they were.
""Who said you could come in?""
Even speaking caused knifing pain in her throat, and her voice was utterly hoarse.
Lindsay said, ""Mrs. Barrette, Mr. Barrette wants me to fetch his clothes for today.""
Though she addressed Claudine politely, the provocation in her tone was undisguised.
Claudine, of course, sensed her hostility.
""They're in the walk-in closet,"" Claudine said, her voice flat.
Lindsay was secretly surprised. The old Claudine would have demanded to know Damian's whereabouts last night and why he'd asked her to fetch his clothes. And Claudine would never have let her anywhere near his walk-in closet.
What had gotten into Claudine today?
Lindsay shrugged. She was quite pleased with Claudine's change, actually.
Getting to handle Damian's clothes‚Äîhis underwear even‚Äîwas such an intimate thing, which made her heart flutter.
She stepped into the walk-in closet. Soon, rustling sounds rang out.
Claudine still seemed indifferent, as if she hadn't heard anything at all.
She got up and headed toward the table, wanting to fetch some water. Throughout the whole time, she didn't even shoot Darlene a glance.
She had never neglected Darlene before this.
Darlene walked over to her and tugged at her arm.
She was about to take the pills. Her hand tilted, and the hot water splashed onto her arm.
Her fair skin reddened at once.
Some of the water spilled on the back of Darlene's hand, which also turned slightly red.
Darlene burst into tears instantly.
Hearing her cries, Lindsay quickly stepped out.
""What happened?"" she exclaimed.
Claudine had already fetched the ointment and was about to apply it to Darlene's hand.
""Darla, it's nothing serious. Everything's gonna be fine. The ointment will do the trick,"" Claudine said.
Lindsay, however, grabbed Darlene and held her close protectively while glaring at Claudine.
""Darla's crying so miserably. How could you say it's fine?
""I get it now. You scalded her deliberately just to get Mr. Barrette home, right?
""I can't believe how vicious you are!"" Lindsay spat.
Claudine's hand holding the ointment hovered in mid-air. Blisters had formed on her scalded forearm, causing throbbing pain.
She glanced at Darlene, assuming the girl would at least explain. But to her surprise, Darlene only briefly met her gaze before retreating into Lindsay's arms.
It'd be lying to say she wasn't disappointed.
After all, she had raised Darlene for five years.
She averted her gaze and put the ointment back onto the table.
""I'm vicious? Fine. Then take her away.""
After saying this, she turned around.
The physical pain was nothing compared to her heartache.
Lindsay shouted at her retreating figure, ""I'm so going to tell Mr. Barrette what happened today!
""He'll know what kind of person you really are!""
""Whatever,"" she responded nonchalantly.
She didn't even stop or look back.
Seeing this, Darlene, who had been burying herself in Lindsay's embrace, pouted unhappily.
She was still mad at Claudine for refusing to make cookies with her last night. That was why she didn't explain.
She glanced at the back of her hand‚Äîthe redness had faded, and it no longer hurt that much. But she clearly remembered seeing blisters on Claudine's forearm.
It must have hurt so much...
Lindsay lowered her head, asking Darlene, ""Darla, how about I take you to the office to see Mr. Barrette?""
Kids' moods changed quickly.
At the mention of Damian, Darlene beamed at once, totally forgetting about Claudine.
By the time Claudine stepped out of the walk-in closet, Darlene and Lindsay had already left.
The throbbing pain in her forearm was like a reminder, telling her there was nothing left to keep her here.
Chapter 4
Her gaze fell upon the diamond ring on her ring finger, the large stone glinting coldly in the sunlight.
She removed the ring lightly, leaving a reddened ring mark, ugly as a scar.
That was right‚Äîshe was getting a divorce.
It wasn't an impulsive decision. In fact, she had been considering a divorce for nearly a year.
She had been hesitating‚Äîuntil the moment she bled out, dialing a call that would never be answered.
As she lay in the pool of blood, listening to the familiar mechanical voice on the phone, memories of this five-year marriage flashed across her mind.
Perhaps her baby had been spared‚Äîno innocent soul deserved to be trapped in this loveless family.
She glanced around, realizing nothing really belonged to her.
Even the room was decorated by Damian's ex-wife.
Once women learned to let go, they could see a lot of things clearly.
Damian had never truly thought of her as his life partner.
Now, she was done living in fantasy, trying for something impossible.
She opened the dresser drawer, taking out her auctioneer's license and all sorts of awards she had won.
They had once occupied the pride of place at home. Yet after she married Damian, they were exiled to a forgotten corner.
Despite being out of the workforce for years, she had meticulously renewed all certificates every year, so they remained valid.
She carefully dusted off each trophy and certificate before placing them in her suitcase.
Aside from these, the only thing she took away was the card Damian had given her last night.
After all, that was rightfully hers.
The diamond ring remained on the dresser as she dragged her suitcase through Belmont Estates' gates.
***
Darlene spent the afternoon in Damian's office.
The burn on the back of her hand had long stopped hurting. But when Lindsay told Damian about what had happened, she still squeezed out a few tears while nestling in his arms.
Holding her tenderly, Damian carefully applied ointment to her hand.
""Does it still hurt?"" he asked.
Fathers tended to spoil their daughters, and he was a textbook example of this indulgence.
She shook her head, enjoying snacks while propping her little feet on his thigh with a grin.
In fact, she had long forgotten what had happened in the morning.
But Lindsay wouldn't miss any chance to tell on Claudine.
""Mr. Barrette, I'm just your assistant, and I know I'm not in a position to say this. But ... Mrs. Barrette really needs to pay more attention to take care of Darla.""
She recounted what had happened, exaggerating in every possible way. But seeing the impassive expression on Damian's face, the more she spoke, the more uncertain she became.
Darlene was the apple of his eye. She assumed he'd fly into a rage upon hearing the story‚Äîmaybe he'd divorce Claudine in a fit of anger.
But he didn't react as she imagined.
Damian asked, ""Darla, is what Lindsay said true?""
Darlene's eyes instinctively flicked to Lindsay before snapping to Damian.
She knew Damian hated children who lied. However, what Lindsay had told her on the way here echoed in her mind. ""This is the only way he'll take you on his next business trip.""
She hung her head, burying her face in the crook of Damian's neck.
""Daddy... It hurt so much...""
Damian doted on her the most. The tears on her face broke his heart, and he could no longer keep a straight face.
""Don't cry, Darla. With the ointment, you'll be fine in a second. Be more careful from now on, alright?"" he coaxed gently.
Darlene knew it meant he had taken her words for it.
Wrapping her arms around his shoulder, she saw Lindsay giving her a thumbs-up while Damian wasn't looking.
But she wasn't happy at all. Instead, Claudine's blistered forearm constantly resurfaced in her mind.
Chapter 5
She pouted and sighed, deciding to apply ointment to Claudine's forearm personally tonight.
After having dinner, Damian and Darlene came home.
As he pushed open the door, she immediately wriggled out of his arms and dashed to the second-floor bedroom.
She remembered seeing Claudine place the ointment on the dresser.
She was too short to see the dresser top, so she reached up and felt around instead.
""Got it!""
Her hand brushed against the tube, and she grabbed it with a grin. With a tug, she accidentally yanked something else down, too.
Looking around, she saw nothing on the carpet. No longer dwelling on it, she skipped out of the bedroom.
The ring rolled across the carpet before disappearing under the bed.
She searched every corner downstairs, but Claudine was nowhere to be seen.
""Angie, where's Claudine?"" she asked.
While wiping a table, Angie replied, ""She left with a suitcase right after you did.
""She didn't say where she was going, though.""
""She went out?""
Darlene was a bit surprised.
She thought, ""Claudine's never been away while Daddy and I are home.
""So ... Claudine really is mad?
""She's so petty!
""To think she even ran away from home!
""Does she think Daddy will go looking for her? She's wrong!""
In a huff, she tossed the ointment onto the sofa.
She was upset with Claudine again. Claudine didn't deserve her kindness!
After dealing with business in the study, Damian returned to the bedroom but didn't see Claudine.
Only then did he notice something wrong‚Äîsomething was missing from the dresser. Also, the card he had given to her last night was gone.
Between last night's argument and Darlene's burn, he figured Claudine had left to steer clear of his anger.
He didn't dwell on it. After all, he never wasted time on trifles.
He was confident‚ÄîClaudine would come back within two days, tops.
***
Claudine went back to the riverside penthouse she had bought before her marriage. A thick layer of dust covered everything, which was hardly surprising, since she hadn't set foot in the place for years.
But she had reached out to the property management beforehand, so the penthouse was spotless when she arrived, complete with all the essentials.
After organizing her things, she took a satisfied look around. Every decorative piece in the room delighted her, and all her trophies and certificates were perfectly arranged in the living room display cabinet.
For a moment, she felt like going back to those days before her marriage.
She slept soundly that night. When she finally awoke, golden sunlight already filled the room.
It had been ages since she'd slept so well. Gone were the frantic mornings of rushing Darlene to school and the last-minute ironing of Damian's suits. For once, she could take her time to enjoy her breakfast. Then she began reviewing the auction materials.
She had to admit‚Äîshe was thrilled about becoming an auctioneer again.
While others struggled with lot descriptions and technical specifications, she knew them like the back of her hand.
As her gaze swept over those familiar terms, she seemed to see her former self again, glowing under the dazzling light, standing center stage.
She was very much looking forward to the auction tomorrow night.
***
On the contrary, Damian had been in a foul mood these days. Early in the morning, he stormed around when the cufflinks didn't go with his tie. To make things worse, even his suit was still unironed.
The servants all shook their heads, saying they didn't know where his cufflinks were. They told him Claudine had personally taken charge of things like this.
He wanted to call Claudine, but then decided not to.
Why would he? She'd come back soon anyway.
Meanwhile, Darlene kept giving him a headache.
Claudine had always taken care of her, and she stubbornly refused to let any servant near her. Even the breakfast wasn't to her liking‚Äîshe pouted, saying the food was awful.
Chapter 6
Left with no choice, he ended up tending to her himself, bringing her along with him even at work.
Lindsay knocked on the door and then entered his office.
""Mr. Barrette, the charity auction starts at six. We should head off soon.""
Hearing this, Darlene, who was playing with Lego, immediately perked up.
""Daddy, I wanna go, too!""
Damian picked her up and wiped her mouth with a wet tissue.
""Sure, sweetie.""
Claudine arrived at the venue in advance to make preparations.
The auction was sponsored by several philanthropists, and all proceeds would go to the United Women and Children Foundation.
Given the extensive number of lots, two auctioneers would be conducting today's auction as required.
According to the dual-auctioneer system, a veteran auctioneer would prime the audience during phase one, while Claudine, the ""Ace Auctioneer"", would take over for the final push.
She was reviewing the lot specifications in the preparation room.
Just then, the organizer came over to introduce her to a benefactor. ""Mr. Gregory, this is Ms. Hogan, the 'Ace Auctioneer' you requested.""
She stood up and said politely, ""You're flattering me.""
Extending her hand, she smiled gently and gracefully.
""Hello, Mr. Gregory. I'm Claudine Hogan. Thank you for your trust, and I promise I won't let you down.""
In fact, she was very curious. After all, she had been absent from an auction of this scale in years. Why would he want her as the lead auctioneer?
He reached out and touched her fingertips briefly.
""It's been a while, Claudine.""
His voice carried a gentle warmth, reminding her of a mountain stream.
She studied his face‚Äîthere was something vaguely familiar about his features. But after trying for a few seconds, she still couldn't place him.
He keenly sensed her embarrassment and smiled, saying, ""I'm Roberto.""
""Roberto!""
She looked at Roberto Gregory with a surprised smile. Seriously? Was this refined gentleman in a tailored suit really Roberto, the bullied boy from her high school days?
Since they were old acquaintances, the organizer sensibly excused himself, leaving the room to them.
Roberto offered, ""There's a caf√© downstairs. Wanna go catch up? There's still time before the auction.""
Claudine nodded readily.
For one thing, they went way back. For another, he was the benefactor today. It was only right that she talked to him and had a better idea of his price expectations.
They entered the caf√© together.
""Time leaves you untouched. You still look amazing after all these years,"" looking at her, he remarked with quiet sincerity.
His compliment came with exact measure, bridging their distance while avoiding presumption.
She smiled, ""But you've changed a lot. To think I didn't recognize you.""
They laughed while reminiscing about those days in high school. She smiled brightly, those long-forgotten memories bringing her back to her wonderful, carefree youth again.
Damian walked into the venue holding Darlene's hand, who craved dessert.
Lindsay said, ""Mr. Barrette, there's a caf√© over there. I'll go buy Darla a slice of cake.""
He nodded and handed her a card.
""Take this. I'll take Darla back after making an appearance. You stay here and bid on some jewelry for me.""
She took the card and headed toward the caf√©.
Darlene was thrilled to be out, keeping looking around curiously while squirming in Damian's arms.
Suddenly, she pointed toward the window and squealed, ""Daddy, look! It's Claudine!""
Following Darlene's pointing finger, Damian looked over and saw Claudine with a man.
They were chatting, and Claudine was smiling brightly.
He hadn't seen such a radiant smile on her face for ages.
Compared to adults, kids were more impulsive. While he stood still, Darlene squirmed out of his arms and ran toward Claudine.
""Claudine, what are you doing here?""
Chatting with Roberto about the lots today, Claudine was surprised to see Darlene.
""Darla?"" she blurted out.
Looking at Darlene, Roberto asked politely, ""Claudy, this is...""
Chapter 7
Just as Claudine was about to introduce Darlene to him, she remembered that Darlene had never admitted to being her stepdaughter.
Today of all days, she couldn't afford to embarrass herself in front of Roberto. The last thing she wanted was for him to question her professionalism.
""She's the daughter of a friend of mine.""
Damian happened to hear her say this while coming over.
He instinctively looked at Claudine, only to see her bare ring finger.
His gaze turned icy as he quickly averted his gaze and bent over to pick up Darlene.
""Daddy...""
Darlene felt upset, but she couldn't tell why.
Joy flooded her when she spotted Claudine, but Claudine offered neither embrace nor affectionate words at all.
***
Claudine wasn't surprised to see Damian.
He was Bronzevale's foremost elite. Of course, he wouldn't have missed such a high-profile charity auction.
She didn't mind him seeing her here. After all, she was already set to divorce him.
Roberto stood up first and extended his right hand.
""Hi. I'm Roberto Gregory, Claudine's friend.""
Damian nodded slightly in response.
""Damian Barrette,"" he said concisely.
Roberto retracted his hand, smiling humbly.
""Mr. Barrette, it's my pleasure to see you.""
This time, Damian didn't say anything. He just turned to look at Claudine.
Different from her normal attire, she wore a sleek, form-fitting black business suit today, her skirt ending perfectly above the knees.
Her charm managed to transform the most conventional attire into something captivating.
Damian's gaze darkened.
Uneasy under his stare, Claudine parted her lips, wanting to say something.
Just then, Darlene said while wrapping her arms around Damian's neck, ""Daddy, look! Lindsay's coming over.""
Damian nodded and said to Roberto, ""Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gregory.""
Claudine watched as Damian walked toward Lindsay.
While still meters away, Darlene stretched out her arms, seeking Lindsay's embrace.
The three of them then entered the elevator together, the smiles on their faces stinging her eyes...
She lowered her head to take a sip of the coffee, bitter and sobering.
Meanwhile, Roberto gazed at her. Her eyes, beautiful yet unreadable, suggested volumes left unspoken.
But since she didn't share, he wouldn't pry.
Soon, the auction began. Within minutes, Darlene pouted, complaining about how boring it was.
Damian said a few words to Lindsay before taking Darlene to leave.
In the car, Darlene nestled in his arms, so sleepy that she could barely keep her eyes open.
""Daddy, when is Claudine coming home? I miss her bunny-shaped sandwiches.""
Hearing this, he looked down at her, only to see her dozing off.
He draped his suit jacket over her before turning to look outside the window.
Neon lights flickered, adorning the streets. When had it started raining? He hadn't even noticed.
This kind of weather always slithered under one's skin so easily...
As the auction hit its climax, Claudine stepped into the spotlight.
After five years, she stood on stage, hosting a major auction like this. Facing the audience, she almost felt like she was reborn.
Damian's presence didn't cross her mind. Her only focus was on figuring out how to maximize the auction's value.
Lindsay gaped at Claudine, wondering if she was seeing things.
Claudine? An auctioneer? No way.
She was a housewife, good at nothing but chores, wasn't she?
Lindsay was on pins and needles as she fixed her gaze on Claudine, the center of everyone's attention, radiating confidence and brilliance.
Deep down, she had always looked down on Claudine. To her, Claudine got to be Damian's wife all thanks to her pretty face and powerful family.
If she had been born into such a wealthy family, she'd have ended up with Damian‚Äînot Claudine.
But today, she realized she was wrong. As she watched those staggering bids and raising paddles, she secretly rejoiced that Damian hadn't stayed. Otherwise, he would have been impressed by this side of Claudine. She was the real gem today.
Chapter 8
Soon, the final item of today's auction was displayed‚Äîan Enchanted Gem Statue.
Claudine gave a detailed explanation of its specifications in a perfect Zutraican accent, her unique, enthralling rhythm holding everyone's attention.
She scanned the room before pointing at the VIP section.
""The bidding starts with an opening price of 1.6 million dollars. I currently have a written commission bid of 4 million dollars. Do we have any offers from the floor?""
Some began raising their paddles.
Claudine closely monitored the audience's reactions as well as phone and online bids. Seamlessly switching between English and Zutraican, she led the auction with practiced ease. Soon, the price soared to 8 million dollars.
""10 million dollars!""
Lindsay raised the paddle.
Damian had specifically asked her to secure the statue.
The entire venue immediately fell silent. The auction hit a lull, and no one raised their paddle.
10 million dollars far surpassed the client's ideal range, but Claudine wasn't satisfied.
That was when her preparation paid off.
Before the auction, she had done her homework. She had searched massive archival documents and comparable sale records, trying to present collectors with comprehensive, objective insights. In this way, they could fully grasp the lots' scarcity and significance.
She adjusted her posture from slightly leaning forward to standing upright before giving a detailed introduction of the sculpture's rarity and investment value. Then she said, ""Ms. Powell has placed a bid of 10 million dollars. It seems she's determined to go home with the statue.""
With that, she looked over at the VIP section.
""Do we have any further challengers for Ms. Powell?""
Soon, someone offered 12 million dollars.
Claudine immediately said, ""12 million dollars from the gentleman in the front! Can we reach 13 million dollars?""
Though she still seemed elegant, she deliberately spoke faster, adding a touch of urgency to her poised demeanor. Soon, an invisible tension filled the air.
""13 million dollars from an online bidder!
""Can I hear higher?
""16 million dollars! It seems congratulations are in order to the gentleman in the front.""
Looking at Lindsay, she smiled, ""Ms. Powell, would you like to make a phone call for instructions?""
It wasn't the first time Lindsay had attended an auction for Damian. Claudine's performance had proven her capabilities beyond question, which totally impressed Lindsay.
She called Damian and came back with an offer of 21 million dollars.
""21 million dollars going once... Twice... Sold to Ms. Powell! Congratulations, Ms. Powell!""
The price established a new benchmark for the statue. What was more, it put Claudine back on the map in the auction world.
Surrounded by a crowd, Claudine smiled graciously at everyone's compliments. All traces of her earlier grievance around Damian were gone, replaced by a new confidence that even made her eyes sparkle.
Staring at her, Lindsay couldn't help but wonder‚Äîhad Damian ever seen this side of her?
It was late after the celebratory banquet ended.
Claudine drank a lot. She couldn't remember the last time she was this happy.
Roberto insisted on giving her a lift, and she found it rude to reject him.
Outside her penthouse, she pushed open the door and stepped out of the car.
""Thanks for tonight,"" she smiled gracefully.
Roberto smiled, too. ""Go on up. You don't wanna get cold.""
After waving at him, she walked toward the elevator.
Holding an umbrella, she walked through the winter rain. Under the dim yellow streetlight, a halo seemed to envelop her, rendering her beauty almost ethereal.
As Roberto stared at her retreating figure, his heart skipped a beat.
He couldn't help but feel a bit regretful. He should have come back sooner...
It was already very late after Damian put Darlene to sleep.
Claudine hadn't been around for the past few days. Though there were maids at home, Darlene refused to be alone with them. After all, Claudine had been taking care of her since her childhood.
Chapter 9
Having no option, he could only keep Darlene by his side.
It had been days already, and Darlene couldn't help but grow bored. Tonight's auction was the best example.
As he thought of the auction, Claudine's face uncontrollably emerged in his mind.
He thought, ""She knew I'd be there today, so she had waited there for me.
""Women are so predictable.
""I know what she's thinking. After running away, she found coming back embarrassing, so she pulled this stunt. She even found a man to play along?
""How lame.
""But things can't keep going on like this forever.
""Someone's got to take care of Darla.
""Besides, if she pulls a couple more stunts like today's, it'll only invite gossip.""
By the time he finished a cigarette, he had already made a decision.
He took out his phone and pulled out his chat records with Claudine. A week had passed since they last spoke.
Back then, he had taken Darlene on a trip in Novahelm, and Claudine had actually called him dozens of times.
He couldn't help but furrow his brows.
To him, women were such a hassle. But at least Claudine had been obedient after their marriage. He couldn't help but wonder‚Äîwhat had gotten into her this time?
He closed the chat, opened a banking app, and froze her card.
Without money, how long could she possibly survive on her own? He couldn't wait to find out.
Claudine slept soundly that night. When she woke up, it was already past 8:00 a.m.
Though it was the dead of winter, with the heating and the golden sunlight, warmth seeped through her limbs.
In a good mood, she brewed herself a pot of coffee, sat on the balcony, and gazed at the river view not far away.
Just then, her phone dinged‚Äîit was a bank notification.
She had received her auction commission. Her smile grew bigger as she saw the number.
Soon, her doorbell rang.
The divorce lawyer she had scheduled stood outside.
She demanded thirty percent of Damian's assets. They had been married for five years, and she had sacrificed almost everything. It wasn't too much to ask.
After signing the divorce agreement, she had a courier deliver it to Damian's office.
Then she washed up quickly before heading to the faculty housing at Camberwell University.
Though she had psyched herself up, after arriving, she still couldn't bring herself to open the door.
""Claudine, have you thought this through? Are you really going to give up your Ph.D. just for a man? I fought to get you into this doctoral program! After being admitted, now you're telling me you want to quit? Think clearly, Claudine. Are you really choosing a man over your career?
""Claudine, if you walk out that door, don't expect me to see you again!""
She still vividly remembered the disappointed look on the face of her professor, Adriana Nixon.
Over the past five years, she could never work up the courage to go see Adriana.
She had been filled with guilt and shame. After all, what Adriana had said was right. The harsh reality proved how stupid she was, throwing away everything she had for the sake of a man.
Back then, she had been Adriana's star student. During her graduate studies, her research under Adriana's supervision led to her publishing a paper in an SCI-indexed journal, and her work in applying modern technology to cultural artifact restoration earned professional recognition.
Now that she was set to become an auctioneer again, she'd continue working on cultural relic authentication and conservation, too.
But ... would Adriana still accept her? She really had no idea.
Clutching the gifts she had bought for Adriana, she walked upstairs. Standing by the door, she hesitated for a long time before finally mustering her courage and knocking on the door.
""Who is it?""
The door opened, and an elderly woman with gray hair and a hunched back came into her view.
Chapter 10
She was stunned, her nose twitching.
Within five years, Adriana had aged so much...
""Prof. Nixon...""
Adriana snorted, ""What are you doing here?""
""Prof. Nixon, I'm here to see you. I...""
""Have you forgotten what I said? You chose that man over everything. I don't want to see you ever again! Don't call me Prof. Nixon! You disgrace me! Go away!""
With that, Adriana pushed Claudine out.
With a loud bang, she slammed the door in Claudine's face.
""Prof. Nixon, I know I failed you. Please... Just give me another chance. I'll take the exams again and reapply for your Ph.D. program. I mean it. Please believe in me!""
Adriana opened the door again.
She looked at Claudine, her star student. The past radiance in Claudine's eyes had vanished, replaced by glistening tears, indicating how regretful she was.
Adriana's students had told her about last night's auction.
She was certain Claudine would come and see her.
Claudine was the most talented student she had ever taught. Back then, she had tried her best to persuade Claudine to make the right choice, but to no avail.
Seeing the bitter smile on Claudine's face, she could tell that things didn't turn out the way Claudine had wanted.
""After a few years, you surely can talk big now. What makes you think you can reenter my Ph.D. program so easily?""
Adriana kept a straight face, and her tone was harsh.
Yet, looking at her, Claudine burst into tears of joy.
She knew she had earned Adriana's forgiveness.
""Prof. Nixon, thank you... Thank you for forgiving me..."" she said in a sobbing voice.
Adriana clicked her tongue, deliberately looking disdainful.
""I didn't say that. Let me be clear‚Äîthis is my last year taking Ph.D. students. You know there's only one spot. If you really want it, prove you have what it takes.""
Claudine wasn't frustrated at all. Instead, she said with a confident smile, ""I will, Prof. Nixon. Believe me.""
While remaining unemployed after marriage, she had been sharpening her skills in cultural relic authentication and conservation.
Five years ago, she had thrown away her future for a man. She'd never make that mistake again.
In the CEO's office of the Barrette Group.
Damian was dealing with work when Lindsay knocked on the door.
""Mr. Barrette, this is the statue from last night. And here's a document requiring your signature.""
She put them on his desk.
He opened the box and said, ""Alright. You may leave.""
Then he took a photo of the statue and said to the phone gently, ""I've got it. I'll bring it to you next time I'm in Novahelm.""
Noticing Lindsay hadn't left, he frowned.
""Anything else?""
Lindsay shook her head.
She glanced at his phone, a trace of sadness flickering in her eyes.
""No. Mr. Barrette, I'm heading out.""
He nodded, not saying anything.
Just as he picked up the document envelope beside him and opened it, his phone on the desk buzzed.
He immediately put the envelope aside.
It was a message.
""Thank you, Dami. I've got treat news! I'm going home.
""Remember the doctoral advisor I told you about before? She's just announced she's accepting one Ph.D. student this year. I wanna go for it.
""If it all goes well, I'll stay in the country from now on. Then I'll get to see Darla often.""
Damian soon texted back, saying he'd go pick her up with Darlene the day of her return.
Then he made a call to arrange for a riverview apartment for her to stay.
He had forgotten all about the opened envelope.
Later, when Lindsay came in to tidy up, she spotted it and put it in the file box, assuming Damian had already reviewed the document inside.
After returning from Adriana's apartment, Claudine received a call from Damian's mother, Brandie Sullivan.
""Brandie, what's up?""

1my93rk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my93rk,Basil seed Thresher 2.0,"It‚Äôs a new year, and with my basil crop coming in hot, I felt the irresistible compulsion to make a bigger, better seed thresher than I made last year. Why this motivates me, I‚Äôll never know‚Ä¶

This year‚Äôs version is¬†*bigger and better*! And by bigger, I mean smaller, and by better, I actually do mean better. If you think it looks suspiciously like a manual coffee grinder, don‚Äôt be fooled! 

.‚Ä¶Well okay, it basically is, but with some key modifications to make it less grindy and more threshy.

Functionally, it‚Äôs simple: I add basil pods in the top, turn the finger crank, and out the bottom come seeds and husks. There‚Äôs some mechanical mumbo jumbo happening in between, but that‚Äôs not really important.

The big upgrade this year is an adjustment option! I can twist the top section to set the spacing between the inner and outer burrs. Too tight and I get aromatic seed powder, too loose and I‚Äôm just moving intact pods from top to bottom. However, once I found the right middle ground, the seeds separated cleanly and without damage.

¬†This also¬†*should*¬†make it usable for other seed types.... In theory‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a solid theory I promise, but I‚Äôm leaving the experimental confirmation of that to others if they are interested.

Next on my to do list is a trommel-style cleaner to separate seed from chaff. Last year I tried to combine threshing and cleaning in one tool, but it wasn‚Äôt very effective or adjustable. This time I‚Äôm making it a dedicated tool. Ideally it will be compact, adjustable for different seeds, and fully 3D printed. After that, I‚Äôll revisit my seed sorter. I built one last year that worked well, but it was big, tricky to print, and over complicated to operate.

You might reasonably ask, ‚ÄúWhy is any of this necessary?‚Äù And the obvious answer is that it‚Äôs not. But I relax and have fun designing and making things like this, and that‚Äôs reason enough for me.",3,1755973752.0,seedsaving,0,1.0,False

To prove a point?","Title says the situation. Literally. On her phone the entire session. Which she had grabbed it before to either take a note or email me a quote or article. I kept telling myself she was just taking serious notes. Especially because the trauma I was dumping on her for $150 was a big deal from a big emotions trip. She gave zero feedback. Not even an ""uh huh."" I told myself it was me imagining her absolute lights out approach to our current session. There was no way the lady I had emotionally invested in for the last 3 months was abandoning me right in front of my eyes. 

So I answered ""I actually feel very empowered. I took a big step for myself and now that I've said it out loud I realize how good I feel about myself and the difference I made ""

Like... It was a BIG trip in my timeline. Damn right GO ME! 

I left her office feeling very empowered. And I got into the truck where my waiting husband was in the driver seat and started to tell him about how good I felt after my session. And then I interrupted myself with ""but she was on her phone the whole time."" When he responded ""the whole time?"" And it was questioned in an offended tone of voice, I knew I was offended. And I was offended. 

Like. What? 

But I continued to try and ignore the fact that I was offended. And by ignore I mean blame myself. I mean, I'm in therapy to stop doing that very self sabotaging move on myself. With this lady! Does that make sense? No. And I realized that when I was rationalizing her behavior once again as ""maybe she had something going on. She's human too."" 

The human excuse started to wear thin and about snapped when my friend Nayt was telling me about his therapist coming through for him and guiding him out of a toxic thought. I realized my therapist was not guiding like that. My therapist was letting me therapist myself. And she was okay with that.

She was okay with that until I accidentally pointed it out. I did so at again the teachings of my wise friend Nayt when he pointed out the fact that I was obsessing my husband was going to die had nothing to do with my intuition abilities but instead with my undiagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder. Boom! OCD. Holy shit. It was the brightest light that had been turned on so far on my journey. 

OCD EXPLAINED SO MUCH.

Which, correct me if I am wrong, would be seen as a breakthrough moment and a jumping off point for healthy coping mechanism, if paired with a therapist of light, for a patient or human being. 

The snap of realization came when I went to tell my wise friend Nayt about the phone incident and defended her as being human and having her own shit going on. Which I tried to believe. Maybe she was going through a divorce. Maybe she was texting her dog's vet. I mean she's human. Right? 

That's a fact. She is human. And she gets a bruised ego and acts out just like all the other damaged humans who act out in toxic ways. She is human. Unfortunately she is a human in a position with too much power of how people see themselves. And it seems she is not using that power for good. 

This is the kind of action that I believe could have set a past version of me over the edge of self blame. An older version of me would have let this fester and control my thoughts and worth. An older version of me would have showed up next week and handed my power to her on a donut or cup of coffee platter. 

This version of me however, called her office and left a voice mail on the receptionist line letting them know to cancel my upcoming appointment as well as all future appointments due to the behavior she showed to a vulnerable AND cash paying patient. I was looking forward to the reaction of the receptionist but I am grateful for the fact that the message exists to be replayed as many times as needed versus only human account.

Confined there, Louis-Napol√©on spent his days in study, writing, and conducting scientific experiments, later referring to his rigorous self-education as ‚Äúthe University of Ham.‚Äù By the end of 1845, he had spent more than five years in the grim fortress.

When news came that his father, the ex-King of Holland, was gravely ill in Florence, Louis-Napol√©on petitioned to visit him. An emissary approached the French government, but the Council of Ministers coldly refused, arguing that granting the request would be equivalent to a full pardon. Undeterred, Louis-Napol√©on appealed directly to King Louis-Philippe, who remarked that the prince‚Äôs ‚Äúhonour‚Äù should be sufficient guarantee. Yet the Council opposed any action that might resemble a secret pardon. A more submissive draft letter was suggested, but Louis-Napol√©on refused. ‚ÄúI may die in prison,‚Äù he declared, ‚Äúbut I will not degrade my character. My father would not want my liberty purchased at the cost of my honour.‚Äù

Still seeking a compromise, he offered through his English friend Lord Londonderry to leave France permanently‚Äîspending a year with his father in Italy before embarking on permanent exile in America‚Äîbut Louis-Philippe categorically refused. Frustrated with waiting for a hypothetical amnesty, Louis-Napol√©on resolved to take matters into his own hands. A renovation project at the fortress, which he had requested and secured, provided the opportunity.

The escape plan took shape in just ten days, aided by his loyal doctor, Conneau, and his valet, Th√©lin. Observing the workers, they noticed that the commandant‚Äîthough strict‚Äînever rose before eight o‚Äôclock due to rheumatism, giving them a narrow window.

On the morning of 25 May 1846, Louis-Napol√©on disguised himself as a workman. He wore a coarse shirt, blue blouse, trousers with an apron, and wooden sabots over his boots. His pale complexion was darkened with dye, his eyebrows painted, and a black wig covered his hair and ears. With great resolve, he shaved off his trademark moustache and whiskers; even Conneau admitted he would not have recognized him.

Carrying a plank on his shoulder, the prince descended the stairs and slipped out among the laborers. Th√©lin kept the guards occupied with morning drinks while Louis-Napol√©on walked calmly across the courtyard. At one tense moment, he passed officers who knew every worker by face, yet both were distracted by paperwork. At the gate, a sentry reading a letter waved him through, and the ‚Äúworkman‚Äù passed, plank still shielding his face. He was free.

Louis-Napol√©on later described the nerve-racking passage: he had to pass multiple warders, sentries, a turnkey, and even a post of thirty soldiers. At one point, two men studied him closely until one dismissed him with, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs Berton.‚Äù Once beyond the fortress walls, he hurried toward Saint-Quentin, where Th√©lin met him with a prearranged cabriolet. Shedding his disguise, the fugitive crossed the town on foot and boarded a post-chaise for Valenciennes, then immediately caught a train to Brussels. By the time his escape was discovered, Louis-Napol√©on was safely across the Belgian border. On 27 May, he returned to London, remaining there until 1848.

Back at Ham, Dr. Conneau delayed the alarm as long as possible. He spread word that the prince was gravely ill, swallowed medicine himself, and prepared a stuffed dummy for the bed. He even mixed nitric acid with coffee to create a nauseating smell, convincing visitors of the prince‚Äôs illness. By evening, however, the commandant grew suspicious, pulled back the covers, and discovered the ruse. Furious, he demanded when the escape had occurred. Calmly, Conneau replied, ‚ÄúAt seven this morning.‚Äù

For his loyalty, Conneau was sentenced to three months‚Äô imprisonment, Th√©lin was condemned in absentia to six months, while the commandant and guards were acquitted.
