","Listening to the most recent episode, 1012, the interview with Andrea Love, she mentions that organic farming can and often does cause more localized pollution and releases more carbon than traditional farming, and everyone just agreed and the conversation moved on. I had to release to that bit 2-3 times to make sure I heard it right, because I’ll admit, I buy a lot of organic because I am under the impression organic is better at reducing localized pollution, though I hadn’t thought about carbon release beyond the reduction in fossil fuel based nitrogen fertilizers. 

I’ve done some googling and I can’t find anything that backs that assertion up that looks more reliable than the stuff saying organic is better. The more I looked into it the more it reminded me of the coffee good/bad debate.

So fellow skeptics, why is organic farming worse? Is it a function of an increase of resource inputs to get the same yield as conventional crops to offset products lost from pests? Are the organic fertilizers they mentioned worse for local environments? Is it that GMOs make conventional crops for durable in transportation and storage?

It’s not any one thing, but a mix of behaviors and situations that have left me questioning how much effort I want to keep putting in.

Money has become a recurring issue. I regret sharing my income because James now uses it to guilt-trip me into spending more. I work 2 jobs to afford driving lessons, bills, and maintain a social life. While I join her for free or affordable activities, I decline expensive plans I’m not interested in. For example, she wanted to attend a 3-day festival, but I only agreed to one day since some artists I like were performing. She tried to pressure me into all 3 days, bringing up my salary in front of others, which felt inappropriate. I’ve stopped talking about money myself, but it’s frustrating when she uses it against me.

A recent holiday was especially challenging. Dylan (23f) and I planned most of it since James wasn’t sure she’d come. She joined later with her friend Amy, whom I hadn’t met before. They stayed at a different hotel, which was fine, but Amy was incredibly difficult. She threw tantrums over navigation, fought with staff at coffee shops about refunds, and argued over dessert toppings. James didn’t directly cause the issues but often encouraged Amy’s behavior or coddled her during meltdowns. Dylan and I ended up handling most of the logistics, which felt unfair and exhausting.

Despite these frustrations, there were nice moments on the trip. However, James’s actions stood out. For example, when Amy panicked over navigation, I tried to calm her, but James snapped at me to “just lead” instead of offering to help. Navigating is a skill that improves with practice, and I would’ve supported her if she tried.

Since returning, the dynamic hasn’t improved. James often complains that I don’t prioritise her and insists she’s my “best friend,” but it feels one-sided. While I’ve been making new friends and dating, she’s often dismissive. When I mentioned a guy who asked me out, she made a judgmental comment that made me second-guess myself. She also undermines my efforts, like brushing off my fitness routine by saying, “Oh, you’re still doing that?” It’s disheartening, especially since I’m focusing on rebuilding my confidence and need supportive relationships.

I’ve been avoiding her, which I know is immature. I’ve ignored calls and skipped group activities, hoping she’d take the hint. The rest of the friend group has noticed, and I feel guilty. I know James has had a tough year, and I don’t want to add to her stress, but I also don’t feel supported in this friendship anymore. I’m torn about how to address this without making things worse, but I really don’t know what to do!

We chat and have friendly interactions, so it’s been a couple of weeks of random little exchanges. This morning I was telling him as I’m in new in town I said I didn’t have many friends, to which he responded “well would you like to get a coffee sometime” to which I said “I work in the mornings …” as I was sort of half way through my sentence he said “even on a lunch break or something, we’ll make it work.” I didn’t say no, then proceeded to give him my number. He said he’ll text me, which I thought maybe in a couple of days, but surely enough, that afternoon he text me and said “how about a walk and coffee at the lake 7am (in two days time) coffee is his shout.” 
When I said I might get the early gym class that morning too he said “well then maybe we could eat breakfast instead” but I said it’s too early for me to eat then. Then he asked what my address is and he’ll pick me up. 
He also said if we wanted to go earlier, he’s happier too if it’s “easier for me”. I said I wake up early so don’t mind so he said “ok, let’s do 6:30 instead”. 

Background context is he’s from my home town which i haven’t lived in for 12 years. We have interacted because we played under 10 soccer together, 20 years ago… so we remembered each other. So he’s not a stranger, I’ve known him before, but many many years ago.  

Is this a date, yall???? Because his segue in saying let’s get a cuppa was because I said I had no friends, and I just thought he was saying “I’ll be your friend” or am I just naive 😂

Raymond got himself just that, while Brody was taking time off-duty. Ray hoped that they would just get their next steps that day, and that they wouldn't suffer anymore casualties. Of any kind.

Most of them started off their day keeping guard, while others played card games and did other recreational things below.

Something they had down there also kept them sane. There was a decent load of medical grade marijuana and a bunch of rolling papers and bongs and bowls, and every hour or so, they'd all convene to smoke together and take a load off of their minds.

But, they hadn't realized. They were essentially making a smoke-hole. And in due time, it would fill up dramatically, and someone would have to open one of the doors, a massive risk to take, even for a few minutes. When would someone forget?

And what would happen when they did?

Later, that afternoon, everyone was sitting and having their smoke time and talking to one another. And they'd somehow failed to notice just how quickly the bunker had clouded up.

Before long, multiple people had passed out or just barely made it outside of the bunker. Raymond and Brody were unfortunately caught in the pass-out group.

What came next was a shared vision. Their town in absolute ruin, which it was not far off from already, the earth caving in on itself as The Old Ones eradicated the planet like ants beneath their boots, inconsequential. 

So there they floated...in a void. *The* Void. They all stood in a square, as if a reflection of the prison which held them. Before them, appeared a strange man. He wore a blue trenchcoat and a black fedora. His head was all black, devoid of features, as if one with The Void himself.

My mom has been taking care of me and my 4 siblings pretty much on her own for a long time. I’m grateful for all she’s done for us and sacrificed to make us not realize we were growing up poor. As time went on we’ve become a pretty dysfunctional household with just as many lows as there are highs. My older sister (26) is content living at home which I respect; she’s in school. However living in this house is like being in a rollercoaster and I’ve wanted off for some time now. Not out of resentment but out of hope for something better. I’ve spoken about this for years (I’m f22) , just never been the right time financially for me. But now I manage a coffee shop and am looking to start bartending nights and start investing. I’m able and wanting to go out into the world. 

Now: 
A good friend of mine whom I went to high school with and recently reconnected with a few months ago has an extra room. Last night (12/01) I had the bright idea ask if he wanted a roommate, to my delight he said yes! Today he spoke with his mom for her advice as this is new to him too and she was all for it. Came over the next day to plan and discuss, got the key, & now moving in this Sunday. Just like that, crazy but it just worked out.. I’m super excited to be starting these new chapters as scary as it is.. 

However:
I was super excited to tell my mom and two sisters (26 & 16) we had a nice evening hanging out the three of us, then I “dropped the bomb”. they were shocked and upset. (my younger sister I told earlier that night and she had her reservations but supports me). They said that I was being selfish. My sister said she’d return my Christmas gifts? My mom said I was only thinking of myself after asking if they’d help me move and that I’d understand if they could’ve given the short notice. She said not to bother asking anyone because no one will help me. Not that I needed it but it would’ve been nice.. then it turned into being screamed at, saying I’m ruining Christmas because she won’t be able to afford gifts now that she won’t receive my $460 a month contribution to the household. 

Now.. I understand all of her emotions and perspective and I know she gives advice from a place of caring but it definitely comes off like she’s telling me I can’t handle what life throws at me. Now this shows part of why I’m leaving, I’ve talked about and working toward this for years and been unsupported, now that I’m leaving it’s a surprise and I’m springing this on them? That I don’t understand. I tried my best to deliver the news lightheartedly and with their emotions in mind and still got yelled at. I don’t want to cut off communication after moving but man does it feel like I’m being pushed away. Any advice ?",1,1733198466.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

1h5eps5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Klutzy_Sail5986/comments/1h5eps5/grounding_techniques_for_every_lifestyle_from/,Grounding Techniques for Every Lifestyle: From Outdoors to Indoor Solutions,"Grounding, or earthing, is the practice of reconnecting with the earth's natural energy to promote physical and mental well-being. Whether you're outdoors in nature or inside your home, grounding can help reduce stress, improve sleep, and enhance overall health. For busy lifestyles, learning how to integrate grounding practices in a way that works for you is key. This guide provides practical solutions for everyone, regardless of where or how you spend your days.

[grounding science](https://preview.redd.it/t05wy8io4k4e1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b6b803555ef14e532a60b13bf0ab789a6d018db)

# [The Science Behind Grounding](https://inspireculture.org/body-health/natural-remedies/the-science-of-grounding-how-connecting-with-the-earth-may-benefit-your-health/)

Grounding is more than just a wellness trend; it's backed by science. The earth's surface carries a negative electrical charge, and direct contact with it can help neutralize excess positive ions in your body. This electrical exchange has been linked to reduced inflammation, improved circulation, and lower cortisol levels.

**Benefits of Grounding**

* *Stress Reduction*: Grounding calms the nervous system, reducing anxiety and tension.
* *Pain Relief*: Studies suggest grounding can decrease chronic pain by reducing inflammation.
* *Improved Sleep*: Regular grounding has been shown to regulate sleep-wake cycles, leading to deeper and more restorative rest.
* *Enhanced Energy*: Many individuals report feeling rejuvenated after grounding, likely due to better circulation and reduced stress.

By understanding how grounding works, you can better appreciate its impact and make it a priority in your daily routine.

# Outdoor Grounding Techniques

The simplest way to ground yourself is to spend time outdoors. Nature offers a direct connection to the earth's energy, and incorporating it into your lifestyle can be transformative.

**Walking Barefoot**

Walking barefoot on natural surfaces like grass, sand, or soil allows your body to absorb the earth's electrons directly. This practice, often called ""earthing,"" is one of the most effective grounding techniques.

* *How to Get Started*: Spend 10-20 minutes a day walking barefoot in a park, on the beach, or in your backyard.
* *Best Surfaces*: Grass with morning dew, sand at the beach, or moist soil provide the best conductive surfaces.

**Gardening**

Gardening connects you with the earth both physically and mentally. Handling soil with bare hands or kneeling on the ground gives you a grounding boost.

* *Tip*: Skip the gloves when possible to maximize skin-to-soil contact.

**Water-Based Grounding**

Natural bodies of water like lakes, oceans, and rivers are excellent for grounding. Water conducts the earth's energy, enhancing the grounding effect.

* *Simple Practices*: Stand with your feet in the water, swim, or wade into a shallow stream.

Even a short time outdoors can significantly improve your mood and energy, making outdoor grounding an essential practice for anyone with access to nature.

# Indoor Grounding Techniques

For those who spend most of their time indoors or live in urban environments, grounding might seem challenging—but it's entirely possible with the right tools and techniques.

**Grounding Mats and Sheets**

Grounding mats, pads, or bed sheets are designed to replicate the effects of standing on the earth. These tools plug into a grounded outlet, connecting you to the earth's energy while you work, relax, or sleep.

* *How to Use*: Place the mat under your feet while sitting at a desk or use a grounding sheet on your bed.
* *Benefits*: These products are ideal for individuals with limited outdoor access or during colder months.

**Earthing Socks**

Specially designed conductive socks can help you ground indoors when used in combination with grounding tools like mats or conductive flooring.

* *Practical Tip*: Wear these socks while resting on a grounding mat for maximum effect.

**Houseplants and Soil Contact**

Having houseplants isn't just for aesthetics—it's another way to ground indoors. Handling the soil while repotting plants or tending to their needs can provide a subtle grounding effect.

* *Bonus*: Houseplants improve indoor air quality, adding an extra layer of health benefits.

**Touching Metal Water Pipes**

If you don't have access to grounding tools, touching metal water pipes can help. Pipes connected to the earth provide a pathway for discharging excess positive ions.

* *Quick Tip*: Hold a pipe for a few minutes to ground yourself during busy indoor days.

# Grounding on the Go

Busy lifestyles or frequent travel shouldn't stop you from grounding. There are techniques designed for people who are always on the move.

**Grounding Shoes**

Grounding shoes have conductive soles made of leather or carbon that allow you to connect with the earth while walking outdoors. They combine practicality with the benefits of earthing.

* *Ideal for*: Urban environments where barefoot walking may not be practical.

**Portable Grounding Mats**

Small, foldable grounding mats can be taken to your office, hotel, or even a coffee shop. They're compact enough to fit into a bag, making grounding accessible no matter where you are.

**Parks and Green Spaces**

If you're in a city, look for parks, community gardens, or any patches of natural ground. Even a short lunch break spent standing barefoot on the grass can recharge your energy levels.

**Sunbathing**

While it's not direct grounding, sunbathing outdoors combines exposure to natural light with the potential to ground if you're lying on the grass or sand. This hybrid practice boosts mood and reduces stress.

# Grounding for Specific Lifestyles

Grounding can be tailored to fit different lifestyles. Whether you're a busy professional, stay-at-home parent, or retiree, there's a way to make it work for you.

**For Office Workers**

* Use a grounding mat under your desk.
* Take a barefoot walk during your lunch break in a nearby park.
* Place grounding sheets on your bed to recover overnight.

**For Parents**

* Involve your kids in grounding activities, like playing barefoot in the yard or gardening together.
* Use grounding tools like mats or socks during downtime, such as reading or watching TV.

**For Seniors**

* Grounding can aid in reducing inflammation and improving mobility. Short, gentle walks on the grass or using grounding mats while sitting can provide significant benefits.
* Combine grounding with light stretching exercises to enhance flexibility and balance.

# Common Myths and Misconceptions About Grounding

While grounding is simple, there are misconceptions that might prevent people from trying it.

**""It's Just a Wellness Trend""**

Grounding has been practiced for centuries, even if it's only recently gained attention. Indigenous cultures have long understood the benefits of connecting with the earth.

**""It's Only Effective Outdoors""**

Indoor grounding tools are based on the same principles as outdoor practices. While direct contact with the earth is ideal, indoor methods are still effective.

**""You Need to Spend Hours Grounding""**

Even five to ten minutes of grounding can make a noticeable difference. Start small and build from there to fit it into your routine.

# Creating Your Grounding Routine

To make grounding a sustainable habit, incorporate it into your existing lifestyle rather than treating it as an add-on.

* *Start Small*: Begin with 5-10 minutes a day and increase gradually.
* *Combine With Other Activities*: Ground while drinking your morning coffee, meditating, or spending time with loved ones outdoors.
* *Experiment With Techniques*: Try different methods—barefoot walks, grounding mats, or gardening—to find what works best for you.
* *Consistency Matters*: Like any wellness practice, regularity is key to seeing results.

Grounding isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but its benefits are accessible to everyone, regardless of lifestyle. Whether you're strolling barefoot on a beach, using a grounding mat at your desk, or planting herbs in your kitchen, reconnecting with the earth's energy can improve your physical and mental well-being. The key is to find what fits seamlessly into your daily life and commit to it consistently. After all, sometimes the simplest solutions—like touching the ground—are the most powerful.",1,1733198427.0,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,0,1.0,False

MOST people function much better if they sleep from 10pm-6/7am instead of 3am-11/12pm
(I promise from experience and someone who loved staying up late, you feel better)

When you wake up, drink water before your coffee. Atleast a cup, you can manage I promise. 

Go to the gym atleast 3x a week. Do things your body deserves despite how you feel emotionally, take “motivation” out of it and just build discipline. Look I know it’s not that easy, but it’s also not that hard, we make this shit way harder than it has to be.

I was literally a smoker of 16 years between vapes & cigarettes, stayed up till 3am woke up at 1pm, always felt like fucking ass but just assumed it was normal, ate like shit. Ate a lot of sugar & chips. Didn’t workout, and I’d go to the doctor and when they would say “you’re healthy” I wouldn’t believe them. 
I was healthy, I AM healthy. I just treat my body like shit and was expecting a pill to fix it. 
I quit smoking and just started doing these things. That’s it. 
It sucked for awhile but I didn’t let that emotion determine if I was still going to stick to MY rules. - do things despite emotions. 

I get mental health, I’m also on meds. But like you can’t expect the meds to build you strong muscles you feel me?
There’s no “quick fix” you also DO have to put in the effort hence why you NEED to do things despite how you feel emotionally. 

Once you’ve done just those 3 things I’m telling you, you’ll feel better than you feel right now. You might still be depressed, but it won’t be as bad. You begin to build purpose and have intention with what you do and it makes living worth it. 

Do things your body can survive and thrive on, then see if you still feel like a bag of moldy potatoes.

1h5ek64,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rendezvous517/comments/1h5ek64/roommate_situation/,Roommate situation ,"My daughter is in her senior year of college. She found a girl who had signed a lease to an apartment close to campus. They met twice and talked over coffee in which my daughter expressed how she was noise sensitive(mainly at night when studying), liked to keep things clean and didn’t like a lot of people over all the time. The girl saI’d she was a night owl and she lliked diving, EDM concerts, had a pet snake, had tattoos of teeth on her knees and was Christian and didn’t expect to have a lot of people over. My daughter told her how she was raised primarily Jewish, but her dad was Catholic and her grandfather was Indian so she was very open minded and had fun celebrating many holidays and traditions. We both met the roommates mom who was a beautiful, Southern, put-together, and a truly warm lovely woman. My daughter and I decided it was a go and I signed a notarized letter agreeing to pay for half the rent and utilities and the girl‘s parents added my daughter in an addendum as a roommate (but still not the leaseholder). That’s when the nightmare began. The girl told her she was previously involved in many harmful and wreckless things, had anxiety and been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and then found “God” that consequently solved everything and was now set free. Which was fine. My daughter is very open-minded. You do you. However, the girl started making my daughter question her beliefs and criticized a Tibetan prayer flag with positIve quotes on love,friendship, peace, etc and basically asked her to remove it because it invited the devil, along with Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim religious practices. My daughter was insulted because her grandfather was raised Hindu and still celebrates the holidays and traditions. The roommate also pointed out things she “observed” which she found unlike her “normal” teenage activities and expressed how she thought Jesus could help my daughter, like it helped the roommate and my daughter could be free from anxiety and worry. My daughter felt insulted, criticized and a bit frightened. My daughter pulled away and started completely doing her own thing and avoiding her at all costs; trying to avoid conflict, criticism and stress. Her roommate then started being extra mean, critical and seemed to be gaslighting my daughter and borderline bullying her about stupid minor things. My daughter is sweet and unconfrontational. She tried to be nice, and avoid her roommate and the apartment to avoid conflict. It hasn’t worked. In fact, it’s the opposite. This girl has revved up the mean and vindictive behavior and my daughter calls me 5 times a day questioning herself and crying. The roommate has many symptoms of a narcissistic personality disorder. She seems to be enjoying the constant antagonizing and bullying and is unable to listen to my daughters point of view and always has to be right. (ie. putting one jacket with a zipper in the dryer which is right next to my daughter’s room late at night when she knows my daughter is noise sensitive and my daughter kindly asked her to refrain from doing laundry after 10pm on a school night.)It’s pissing me off because I feel like my daughter is submissive and just taking it. I personally would fight back. Do the same things she’s doing to my daughter to show her how it feels. My daughter keeps telling me that I don’t understand, and that by doing that it will only make the situation worse and it would be stooping down to the roommates level and it’s not who she is. Maybe she’s more mature than me but its not fair!! The worst part is that the rent is $1800 a month and I am working extra hours and pulling from my savings because I wanted my daughter to have a memorable senior year considering all the COVID issues when she started, along with some personal challenges she’s fought to overcome. I feel so bad for her. I told her to ask her roommate to try to find someone that’s she is more compatible with for Spring semester. Her roommate said no. I can’t afford to pay her current rent (which I think we are legally bound to because of the notarized letter) and a new rent somewhere else….otherwise, I’d remove her from the situation.

So I started working at a restaurant a few weeks ago. On the weekend I was hosting and an older couple (about 30-40) waved me down and asked for some more coffee. I went and grabbed the pot and poured them some coffee and as I was about to walk off, the man asked what my name was and I told them. I genuinely thought they were impressed with my work and wanted to let the manager know or maybe they were wondering what my ethnicity was through my name? Either way, I told them my first name and they just said okay thank you and I went on with my shift. After a round of seating people and busting tables, they waved me down again and this time the woman spoke to me while the man was on his phone. She asked me if I was free that night and I said for what and then she said if I was free to go on a date. I told them I wasn’t interested and then she quickly asked for the bill. 

Fast forward to today, it’s been two days since then and I get a text from a coworker. Apparently a lady walked into the restaurant asking for me, she said she was my friend and that we had plans and that I bailed and didn’t show up. She asked for the manager and explained that to him and then asked for my schedule and when I was working next. My coworker told me a description of how this lady looked like and it sounds almost exactly like the same woman that asked me out on the weekend. 

I’m kind of worried. I’m trying to act okay and seem fine but I have a shift in two days and it’s making me nervous. What if they show up again? Or what if they try to stop me as I’m walking from or to my car? Any advice on what I should do? Anything would be appreciated",2,1733196969.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I moved back in with my mum (60f) over summer. Mum has appreciated me
being home cus it has meant our dog Ollie isn't home alone. Ollie is a
rescue who was returned to a shelter 4 times, until mum got him. He
doesn't need constant supervision indoors cus we keep him and the cats
separated but he is an anxious and reactive dog so the company's good
for him, he's getting on a bit and has cataracts and possible dementia
which is causing him to become more reactive on occasion. He is also
an escape artist; he can slip his collar and harness easily. The
backyard isn't secure so we have him supervised on a long lead.


While mum is at work I normally look after Ollie. Today while mum was
at work, I woke up but Ollie wasn't looking to go out so he joined me
back in bed. I fell asleep and had a really bad nightmare where he
died (I have sleep issues). He wasn't in my room at all when I woke
up, which was strange. I found him shut outside tied to the backdoor
by his long lead. He was tangled in some plants near the door and
shaking. I got him in & made sure he was ok, he's about the size of a
whippet, v short coat and pushing 13. Idk how long he was out there
but the Dec air can't be good for him. He seemed ok tho so I got some
coffee. When sib came in and I went off. Idk exactly what I said
precoffee but Ik that I'd probably let frustration fuel the rant a bit
(we'd been clashing). I think that I did raise my voice a bit but
definitely not to the point of Yelling. All they said was ""it's not
appropriate for you to address me like that"" which was so jarring I
just said that I was in a bad mood. I took him upstairs and tried to
avoid them the rest of the day. I didn't want to shut him in my room
though so when he wasn't with me I did check he hadn't been shut
outside again.


When mum got home I told her what happened bc I was worried. She had
the same response as me. She also pointed out that he could have
gotten into the nearby farm and been shot, or gotten onto the road and
been run over. Sib explained they'd just had a meeting go badly with
their phd supervisor, and that there was cat vomit all over the
kitchen floor and their room, and there was no one around to help.
They didn't ask me to help. Idk the state of their room, but if the
kitchen had been that bad, I would've stepped in it (I didn't). I
maintained I was right to call them out and said if how I did that was
wrong the way they were now speaking to me was wrong.


A while after they left mum messaged the famchat saying Ollie is very
old and blind and in future it will be less stressful for sib to only
visit when mum isn't working. In a dm to mum they admitted their wrong
and apologised but said he was only there for a min.


I feel weird that they didn't ask me to help, and only apologised to
mum, but idk if I was an ass about the sitch so aita?",1,1733196363.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.67,False

(10 month old) ,"I have only left my baby (10 month old)one other time with his dad for about 5 hours because I was going to a concert with my mom and sister. My mom had bought the tickets months in advance so I felt like I had to go. I left during his normal sleep time so it wasn’t too bad. He stayed up and didn’t fall asleep until 11pm because he’s super attached to me (his normal nap time is 7pm). Since that day I have not left him.

But, I have been experiencing a lot of pain in my stomach and had to come to the ER. I’ve been here since 7pm and it’s currently 10pm. My mom is watching him and he was asleep when I left. I specifically told my mom, “No matter what you do don’t leave his room just rock him till he falls back to sleep.” That is not what she did. He is currently watching tv in the living room and is obviously exhausted from the photos she has sent. However, that’s not really my point in writing this post. Mainly what I’m feeling is horrible for leaving my baby. I couldn’t even say goodbye because he was asleep when I left. And I have already left him once for this long and he did not sleep. He is so attached to me he won’t let anyone give him his bottle but me and he is also breastfeeding at night because we co sleep. 

(I have left my baby a couple of other time but not for more than 30min/1hr to go get coffee, target, sometimes groceries) 

Will leaving my baby like this cause permanent attachment issues? How often does one leave there baby for them to suffer significant attachment  issues? 

And of course, the title of this post, what is my baby feeling right now that I am not with them?

I’ve been thinking about the way we collide with people, how they come into our lives like falling stars, bright, fleeting, beautiful, and then they’re gone. What’s left behind is complicated, a memory, a scar, a feeling you can’t quite name. People like to say that’s just how it is, that connections are meant to be temporary, but I’ve never really believed that.

Some friendships feel rare, almost effortless, the kind where you don’t have to explain yourself because somehow, they already know. It’s not something you find often, and when you do, it feels like it should last forever. But life has a way of pulling people apart. Sometimes it’s timing, sometimes it’s distance, sometimes it’s something so small you don’t notice it until it’s already happened.

And yet, the good parts stay with you. The late-night conversations, the inside jokes, the way it felt like you could be yourself without trying too hard. It’s comforting to know those moments existed, and honestly, they’re more than enough to make me smile when I think about them.

I don’t think this is it for us, though. Not forever. One day, I like to imagine us catching up, laughing about how life went completely sideways for both of us in ways we couldn’t have predicted. Maybe we’ll share a drink, or maybe it’ll be coffee because one of us has finally grown up. It’s a nice thought, isn’t it? A conversation, a good laugh, like old times. Until then, I hope life is good to you, really good.

1h5dn3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GridDownGuide/comments/1h5dn3o/how_do_i_make_my_own_biodiesel_fuel/,How Do I Make My Own Biodiesel Fuel?,"How Do I Make My Own Biodiesel Fuel: A Step-by-Step Guide
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're interested in renewable energy and want to reduce your carbon footprint, making your own biodiesel fuel is a great idea. Biodiesel is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional petroleum diesel and can be made using oils or fats. Here’s a straightforward guide on how to make your own biodiesel fuel at home.

### Gather Your Materials

Before you start, it's essential to gather everything you need. Here’s a list of materials:

- Vegetable oil or animal fat (canola oil is a popular choice)
- Methanol (can be purchased from chemical suppliers)
- Sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide
- A scale for weighing
- Safety glasses and gloves
- A mixing container (non-reactive)
- A filter for cleaning the oil
- A separator funnel
- Storage containers for your biodiesel

### Prepare the Oil

The first step in making biodiesel is to prepare your oil. If you're using used cooking oil, make sure to filter it to remove food particles and impurities. This ensures that your biodiesel will be cleaner and more efficient. You can use a coffee filter or a fine mesh strainer for this process. If the oil is very cloudy, you may need to heat it slightly to help dissolve any solid particles.

### Calculate Your Ingredients

For every gallon of oil, you will need to combine it with a specific amount of methanol and lye. The general ratio is:

- 1 gallon of oil
- 1 gallon of methanol
- 3.5 ounces of sodium hydroxide (lye)

Use a scale to measure your lye accurately. Remember, working with lye requires careful handling, so always wear gloves and safety goggles.

### Mix the Alcohol and Lye

The next step is to mix your methanol and lye. Carefully pour the lye into the methanol. Be cautious, as this reaction produces heat and can create toxic fumes. Always perform this step in a well-ventilated area. Stir the mixture until the lye is completely dissolved, which usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

### Combine Oil and Methanol-Lye Mix

Once your lye is fully dissolved in the methanol, it's time to mix it with your prepared oil. Pour the methanol-lye mixture into the oil. Stir the mixture vigorously for about 30 minutes. You can use a paint stirrer attached to a power drill to make this process easier. This is critical, as thorough mixing helps the chemical reaction take place.

### Let it Settle

After mixing, transfer the mixture into your separator funnel. Let it sit for at least 8 hours. During this time, you’ll notice two layers forming. The top layer is your biodiesel, and the bottom layer is glycerin, which is a byproduct. Allowing them to separate completely is crucial for a high-quality biodiesel.

### Drain and Wash the Biodiesel

Once the layers have separated, carefully drain off the glycerin. You will be left with biodiesel on top. To ensure your biodiesel is free from impurities, wash it with water. Gently pour distilled water into the biodiesel and swirl it around. The water will help remove any remaining impurities. After swirling, let it settle again and drain the excess water.

### Store Your Biodiesel Safely

Now that you have your biodiesel, it’s time to store it. Make sure to use clean, dry containers that are safe for storing fuel. Always label your containers accurately. Store your biodiesel in a cool, dark place to prevent degradation.

### Test the Quality

Before using your biodiesel in a vehicle, it’s important to test its quality. You can do this using simple methods like the “soap test” or checking its viscosity. Quality biodiesel should not form excessive soap bubbles and should flow smoothly with a moderate viscosity.

With these steps, you can create your own biodiesel at home. This process not only helps reduce waste but also contributes to a sustainable future. Enjoy the satisfaction of producing a renewable fuel source that benefits the environment.

The Environmental Benefits of Using Biodiesel as Fuel
-----------------------------------------------------

Using biodiesel as a fuel offers numerous environmental benefits that contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future. This alternative fuel, derived from renewable resources such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease, plays a crucial role in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Understanding the environmental advantages of biodiesel can help you make informed decisions about energy use and sustainability.

### Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions

One of the most significant environmental benefits of biodiesel is its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel is known to emit fewer harmful pollutants compared to traditional diesel. Specifically, it can reduce:

- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2):** Biodiesel can lower CO2 emissions by up to 78% compared to petroleum diesel, helping to mitigate climate change.
- **Particulate Matter:** The combustion of biodiesel results in lower particulate matter emissions, contributing to improved air quality.
- **Hydrocarbons:** Biodiesel combustion releases fewer unburned hydrocarbons, which are known to contribute to smog formation.

### Decreased Dependency on Fossil Fuels

By utilizing biodiesel, you can help decrease the overall demand for fossil fuels. This shift is essential for promoting environmental sustainability. Fossil fuel extraction and consumption often lead to significant environmental degradation, including oil spills, habitat destruction, and pollution.

Additionally, biodiesel can be made from local and renewable sources, such as agricultural crops or waste cooking oil. This local production reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting fuels over long distances, further contributing to environmental conservation.

### Biodegradability and Reduced Toxicity

Biodiesel is highly biodegradable, which means it breaks down naturally and does not persist in the environment like petroleum-based fuels. This quality makes it a safer alternative in case of spills or leaks. When biodiesel spills occur, it is less likely to cause long-term damage to ecosystems and wildlife compared to conventional diesel fuels, which can be toxic and devastating to the environment.

### Support for Agricultural Practices

The production of biodiesel encourages sustainable agricultural practices. Farmers can grow crops specifically for biodiesel, such as soybeans or canola, which can enhance soil quality and biodiversity. This crop rotation can enrich the soil and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, leading to healthier ecosystems. Additionally, as demand for biodiesel increases, farmers may be incentivized to cultivate these energy crops, supporting local economies.

### Contribution to Energy Security

Using biodiesel can strengthen energy security by diversifying energy sources. A broader range of energy options can make communities less vulnerable to fluctuations in fossil fuel markets. By investing in biodiesel, you contribute to a more stable and secure energy future.

### Economic Benefits

Transitioning to biodiesel not only benefits the environment but also promotes economic growth. The biodiesel industry can create jobs in production, distribution, and research. This development leads to a more robust economy and supports local communities. Furthermore, investing in biodiesel production can reduce the costs associated with healthcare due to cleaner air and improved public health outcomes.

### Innovations and Technological Advancements

The growing demand for biodiesel fuels innovation and technological advancements in the field. New production methods and improved conversion processes are constantly being developed, making biodiesel more efficient and cost-effective. These advancements contribute to a sustainable energy landscape and encourage further research into other renewable energy sources.

Embracing biodiesel offers a multitude of environmental benefits that align with sustainable practices. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to supporting local agriculture, the advantages of using biodiesel are clear. By choosing biodiesel, you not only make a conscious decision for a healthier planet but also contribute to energy independence and economic growth. The transition to biodiesel is a vital step in creating a cleaner, greener future for generations to come.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

So we were at the coffee shop, he was behaving okay so I didn't really worry about that. After we finished our drinks, I told him that we should go to the park for a walk, because I don't really feel well at closed places and we barely could hear each other talking because of the music in the background. 

So we got up and when we've arrived, I saw the benches so I told him ""let's sit and talk"" because we've barely talked at the coffee shop. And he was like ""sure"". As I kept talking to him, he takes out the weed and starts smoking. And as someone (me) who never really smoked that before, I was thinking that he would still behave decent so I just ignored that. He did ask me whether it's bothering me, but I said ""I don't mind"" because like, he was already way too into it, few smokes in. 

Suddenly, someone throws firecracker right next to us, and I got scared and told him to get up so we can leave the place. 
As he got up, he walked a few steps then all of sudden fell down and got his head hit onto the (cement) floor. He got too high + drunk. I tried to wake him up, when I turned him back around I saw that his head started bleeding a lot. I started panicking and texted his sister about it and told her to come, but she was at work. 

I helped him to get up and sat him on the bench, told him to wait untl I get some water and tissues. When I came back, I started cleaning his wound and putting water on him and touching him with my hands (because my hands were really cold so thought that would wake him up enough), people started approaching me and asking what happened, but I just said that he accidentally fell down. His sister told me ""girl just leave him there"" but I felt too sorry for him and I was afraid for him to let him go back home on his own so I took him home all the way to his door, because there were a lot of stairs. 
Explained everything to his mother then left. 

It was honestly really bad, but before all that happened, it was really nice and he was being very sweet, but I hope he finally stops harming himself because he's much more than that.

I'm not sure whether we will date for long, but as long as he doesn't get drunk and high while we are on dates, it should be fine, I think.",1,1733194721.0,dating,2,1.0,False

HOWEVER at the time I was a 19 year old in college and didn’t really care that much about all this, I was drinking and smoking all the time and didn’t stick with my treatment plan and just tolerated the constipation by taking miralax and drinking excessive energy drinks. 

Well. Now, I care a lot more about my heal since then. I have significantly reduced my drinking, quit nicotine, stopped smoking weed. My SIBO symptoms are horrible and I have no energy and just want to feel slightly better. I am in severe pain from my SIBO and have resumed treatment for it. I have since had the GI-MAP stool test which showed that my pancreas is not producing enough enzymes and my gut bacteria is terribly throw off. I am prescribed 9 different supplements and my doctor has ordered me to be gluten free, dairy free, sugar free and no soy, yeast, corn, tomato, coffee or alcohol. As a senior in college I feel like this is impossible being on a tight budget and  the stress of school. I am constantly drained of energy, I am lethargic, my stomach aches all the time and I haven’t been able to spend as much time with my friends. This diet is going to be torturous. Please anyone, send encouraging thoughts, is this diet insane? Will it get better? ",1,1733194632.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

It chitters in response and you empty the clip, but fail to crack its exoskeleton.  You run towards the living room.  You need a weapon to protect yourself from this… *degenerate*.  You trip and stumble into the couch.  

Through bleary eyes, you rummage through the coffee-table for *anything* to defend yourself with.  It chatters curiously, and you spin around to make your last stand.  You wildly bludgeon it and screeches with pain, before scampering off.  You look down to see the weapon that will save humanity.

Upon being hired I was never asked to fill out a TD1 and TD1BC form. I asked the owner of the company about this and he mentioned that I am a “contractor” and I should file my own taxes during tax season. 

After looking into this a bit more I realized this is illegal. I am providing work for the company, I am using company materials, I am payed an hourly wage, I have a set schedule and do not set my own hours. He is illegally hiring employees and calling them “contractors” likely to get around paying taxes. Other employees told me they get payed exactly what they worked and no tax is taken out of their paycheques. No paystub is provided. 

I have been uncomfortable with this. On top of other issues. He has very high standards for work, he micromanages, he gives very short deadlines for a large amount of work. This is so unreasonable for just one person. He is very stuck in his ways and does not listen to feedback from other employees. If you complain there is too much work you’ll just be told to use chat GPT. This is unrealistic as you still have to go through and validate and polish the prompts given by AI which takes time! It’s like he doesn’t understand this at all. The working conditions have been so difficult and the other employees seem to agree with this. We are all here because we can’t find anything else better. 

Due to all these issues I decided to quit after a very short amount of time. I have yet to receive a paycheque so I gave the owner a due date to send me payment. I reminded him that under the law I am an employee and not a contractor, therefore I demanded a paystub with the correct tax deducted and told him I expect a T4 during tax season. He said he would forward this to his accountant. 

In addition he also tried to dispute the amount of hours I worked. For my first shift. the date and time was sent to me via email but he did not include this on the online schedule. Therefore he is claiming I didn’t work that day. He is also deducting hour for the breaks. For 5 hour shifts a 15 minute coffee break is deducted. For 7-8 hour shifts a 1 hour break is deducted. However it was never communicated to me that the breaks would be mandatory and unpaid. There’s nothing in the contract about this. So I had worked through these breaks and I am demanding to be payed for it. I threatened the owner that I would escalate to the employment standards branch if I am not payed. 

He said he is forwarding all this to his legal council and accountant. Should I be concerned? What do I do? ",3,1733193651.0,legaladvicecanada,4,0.81,False

Fellow Bears,

As a UC Berkeley Public Health alumnus and current medical student, I feel compelled to share my doctoral dissertation on the most distinguished venues for answering nature's most pressing calls on campus. This isn't merely about finding a porcelain throne – it's about the holistic convergence of gastrointestinal wellness, architectural aesthetics, and mindful meditation.

Through years of rigorous field research and peer-reviewed personal experiences, I've developed a sophisticated framework for evaluating these sacred spaces. My methodology considers crucial variables such as ambient lighting, acoustic privacy (essential for those morning coffee aftermath scenarios), and the elusive 'zen factor' that transforms a mere bathroom break into a transcendent experience.

As any seasoned public health professional knows, the choice of one's daily constitutional venue can significantly impact both physiological and psychological well-being. The right environment can turn a mundane biological necessity into a moment of scholarly reflection or pre-exam meditation.

Let me share my evidence-based findings...ranked accordingly to the evidence-based, aforementioned framework.

**(1) Pimentel Hall** **(1/10) - A Case Study in Architectural Antipathy**

Location: Basement Level, Lower Sproul Plaza 

Named after: Distinguished chemist George C. Pimentel 

Year Built: 1963

Ah, Pimentel Hall – or ""The Pits"" as it's affectionately known by generations of traumatized OChem students. While this brutalist monument to scientific achievement houses one of Berkeley's largest lecture halls and has witnessed countless Nobel laureates' lectures, its bathroom facilities seem to have been designed by someone who clearly had a vendetta against basic human comfort.

The bathroom in question, accessible via a suspiciously dim stairwell that would make Edgar Allan Poe uncomfortable, resides in what can only be described as the building's forgotten catacombs. The facilities appear to have last been updated when Lyndon B. Johnson was president, offering visitors a authentic historical experience of mid-60s plumbing technology.

Notable Features:

* Temperature regulation that alternates between ""Viking Winter"" and ""Sahara Afternoon""
* Acoustic properties that turn every flush into a building-wide announcement
* Vintage graffiti featuring OChem reaction mechanisms from desperate students
* A persistent mysterious drip that has outlasted several department chairs

While the building itself has hosted groundbreaking discoveries in spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, the bathroom appears to be conducting its own long-term experiment in human endurance. The only redeeming quality is that the perpetual sense of despair perfectly matches one's mood after a particularly brutal chemistry midterm.

Pro tip: Best visited during Nobel Laureate lectures when the entire student body is trapped upstairs pretending to understand quantum mechanics.

Sustainability Rating: 1/10 - The only sustainable thing here is the sustained feeling of regret.

**(2) Valley Life Science Building (VLSB) (2/10) - Where Dreams of Med School Go to Die**

Location: Valley Life Sciences Building, 

Lower Campus Built: 1930 

Primary Clientele: Hopeful pre-meds, before organic chemistry crushes their souls

Ah, VLSB – where the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby serves as a haunting reminder that some things are better left extinct, much like these bathrooms. While the building itself stands as a testament to scientific achievement, housing everything from preserved specimens to cutting-edge research facilities, its bathrooms appear to have been designed by the set decorator of ""Children of Men"" during a particularly nihilistic phase.

The stark contrast is almost poetic: above, you have the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gazing down upon VLSB like a disappointed parent, while below, these bathrooms offer an experience that makes the dystopian facilities in ""District 13"" look like the Ritz-Carlton. The ambiance perfectly captures that moment in ""Blade Runner 2049"" when K descends into the ruins of Las Vegas – except instead of irradiated orange hues, you're treated to flickering fluorescent lights and mysterious drips that would make even a microbiologist nervous.

Notable Features:

* A peculiar aroma that has likely evolved into a new life form
* Lighting fixtures that flicker in Morse code, spelling out ""abandon hope""
* Mysterious stains that could be the subject of several PhD dissertations
* Acoustic properties that make every sound echo like you're in the ""Inception"" dream levels

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs study the miracle of life and evolution, the bathrooms seem stuck in a parallel universe where sanitation never made it past the Mesozoic era. The proximity to the dinosaur exhibits feels less like an educational display and more like a warning about the state of the facilities.

Pro tip: Like the protagonists in ""The Maze Runner,"" your best strategy is to run – preferably to literally any other building on campus.

Scientific Value: 9/10 

Actual Usability: 2/10 

Evolutionary Progress: -3/10

Warning: Exposure may result in a sudden understanding of why those dinosaurs went extinct.

**(3) Wheeler Hall** **(3/10) - A Neoclassical Nightmare**

Location: Central Campus, adjacent to hallowed ground where dreams of Stanford acceptance letters go to die 

Architectural Style: Classical Revival (1917) 

Named after: Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who clearly never used these facilities

Ah, Wheeler Hall – that magnificent testament to Berkeley's architectural ambitions, where the ghosts of rejected English dissertations roam the corridors and freshmen practice pronouncing 'Foucault' incorrectly. While its marble-clad exterior whispers sweet nothings of academic prestige, the bathrooms tell a different, more pungent tale.

The facilities present a stunning dichotomy: pristine white tiles that appear to have been designed by someone whose only brief was ""make it feel like walking into a supernova."" The blinding luminescence serves the dual purpose of highlighting every questionable stain while simultaneously searing one's retinas – perhaps a metaphor for the illuminating yet painful process of academic enlightenment.

Notable Features:

* Lighting bright enough to be visible from the International Space Station
* An acoustic design that turns every flush into a dramatic reading of ""The Waste Land""
* A persistent medieval bestiary of insects that would make an entomologist weep
* That one particular stall on the 2nd floor, now famous for its resident arachnid who's probably earned tenure by now

The perpetual sewer bouquet provides a humbling reminder that beneath our sophisticated veneer of literary theory and cultural criticism, we are all still mere mortals. The spider's web above the large stall serves as both a security system and a poignant reminder of the web of interconnected narratives we study in comparative literature.

Pro tip: Best visited between Victorian Literature seminars, when one can truly appreciate the Gothic horror of it all.

Historical Significance: 8/10 

Actual Functionality: 2/10 

Spider Companionship: 10/10

Warning: The blinding white interior may cause temporary existential crises and spontaneous recitations of T.S. Eliot.

**(4) Evans Hall** **(4/10) - The Concrete Confessional**

Location: Northeast campus, looming ominously like a bureaucrat's fever dream 

Built: 1971 Architectural Style: Brutalist (emphasis on 'brutal') 

Primary Inhabitants: Data Scientists pretending they're not just CS majors who couldn't get into CS61A

Ah, Evans Hall – Berkeley's beloved tribute to East German prison architecture. This towering concrete monstrosity stands as a testament to what happens when architects decide that windows are merely a bourgeois construct. While Stanford's computer science department enjoys their Silicon Valley-inspired glass palaces, Berkeley's data scientists toil away in what appears to be a building designed by someone who mistook ""1984"" for an architectural handbook.

The bathrooms, however, exist in a peculiar state of quantum mediocrity – neither notably horrific nor particularly praiseworthy. Like a C+ grade in CS61A, they're just... there. In a building where students contemplate the existential dread of linear algebra and probability theory, these facilities offer a surprisingly neutral refuge from the windowless rooms where dreams of tech internships go to die.

Notable Features:

* Water pressure that follows a perfect normal distribution
* Toilet paper holders that could be used as examples in STATS 101
* A view of absolutely nothing, maintaining the building's commitment to sensory deprivation
* Hand dryers that sound like they're computing Bitcoin on the side

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs crunch numbers to predict the future, the bathrooms remain stuck in a perpetual 1970s time loop. Perhaps this is what the ""mid"" in EECS stands for.

Pro tip: Best visited during the golden hour when the concrete walls cast shadows that make you question whether you're in a bathroom or a modern art installation about institutional conformity.

Structural Integrity: π/10 

Soviet Nostalgia Factor: 9/10 

Data Science Street Cred: sudo/10

Warning: Extended exposure may result in developing an unhealthy appreciation for concrete and a compulsive need to analyze the statistical distribution of toilet paper usage.

**(5) Latimer Hall** **(5/10) - The McDonald's Drive-Thru of Campus Relief**

Location: Chemistry Complex, where dreams of medical school meet reality 

Built: 1963 

Named after: Wendell Mitchell Latimer, who probably had a private bathroom

Ah, Latimer Hall – the express lane of campus bathrooms, where efficiency meets minimalism in a space roughly the size of a reaction vessel. Like the chemistry department's version of a New York City micro-apartment, these facilities embody the principle that size doesn't matter (a lie we tell undergrads about their OChem reaction yields).

This bathroom facility, much like a fast-food value meal, provides exactly what you'd expect: nothing more, nothing less. It's the bathroom equivalent of ""good enough"" – much like that lab report you submitted at 11:59 PM. The space management here is so efficient it would make Marie Kondo proud, though it's unclear if anything here sparks joy.

Notable Features:

* A footprint smaller than a grad student's stipend
* Acoustics that broadcast your presence to every passing GSI
* A sink positioned with the precision of a titration experiment
* That distinct smell of desperation and hydrocarbons

The true charm lies in its role as the preferred alternative to Pimentel's basement horror show – much like how students prefer literally any other career path after their first semester of OChem. It's the bathroom equivalent of settling for your safety school: not your first choice, but hey, at least you got in.

Pro tip: Best utilized between the hours of 2:15-2:45 PM when most GSIs are busy crushing undergrads' hopes in office hours.

Efficiency Rating: 8/10 Size-to-Usage Ratio: 3/10 GSI Encounter Probability: 0.457 ± 0.023

Warning: May encounter bitter graduate students muttering about failed columns and rejected manuscripts. Avoid eye contact and back away slowly while showing your lab notebook as a sign of submission.

**(6) Dormitory Bathrooms  -- The Great Residential Divide: A Tale of Two Bathrooms**

**Blackwell Hall (8/10) - The Bourgeois Paradise**  
Location: Wherever the sun actually shines in Berkeley  
Built: 2018, when someone finally remembered students need housing

Behold, Blackwell Hall – Berkeley's monument to social stratification, where the chosen ones reside in their gleaming tower of modern amenities. The bathrooms here aren't just facilities; they're spa-like sanctuaries where privileged students can contemplate their good fortune while sitting on porcelain thrones that probably cost more than a semester's worth of textbooks. The water pressure is so perfect, it makes even Stanford students jealous.

Notable Features:

* Motion-sensor everything, because touching things is for peasants
* Lighting that makes everyone look Instagram-ready
* Actually functional ventilation (revolutionary concept)
* Mirrors that don't make you question your life choices

**Unit 3 (2/10) - The Proletariat's Purgatory**  
Location: The shadowy realm where hope goes to die  
Built: Sometime between the Gold Rush and the Summer of Love

Ah, Unit 3 – the living testament to Berkeley's commitment to ""character building."" Where the bathroom becomes a thrilling game of ""Guess What That Smell Is"" and ""Why Is The Floor Always Wet?"" The gender-inclusive facilities would be progressive if they weren't also inclusive to various forms of fungi and bacterial colonies conducting their own independent research projects.

Notable Features:

* Shower drains that double as unauthorized toilets
* A mysterious symphony of 3 AM sounds that would intrigue paranormal investigators
* Water pressure that alternates between ""gentle mist"" and ""fire hose""
* An ecosystem diverse enough to qualify as a biology field study site

The Nocturnal Experience:

* 2:00 AM: Mysterious sobbing (probably OChem related)
* 2:30 AM: Someone practicing their kazoo
* 3:00 AM: The ghost of failed midterms past
* 4:00 AM: That one person who decides to take a shower while practicing opera

Real-life survival tips:

* Always wear shower shoes (consider hazmat boots)
* Don't ask about the strange noises
* Pray for seismic activity to end your suffering
* Remember: what doesn't kill you makes you more qualified for grad school

Wealth Gap Rating: Wider than the Berkeley Hills  
Cultural Experience: Marx would write a sequel  
Earthquake Preparedness: Please, just one small tremor

Warning: Extended exposure to Unit 3 facilities may result in developing a superhuman immune system or a deep understanding of class warfare – possibly both.

**(7) The Libraries' Hidden Chambers (6/10) - Where Knowledge Meets Nature's Call**

Location: Scattered throughout campus like ancient wisdom  
Focus: Moffitt Library & Free Speech Movement Café Area  
Primary Clientele: Sleep-deprived students and coffee-fueled academic hermits

Ah, the library bathrooms – where intellectual discourse meets intestinal discourse. These sacred chambers, particularly those near FSM Café, offer a uniquely Berkeley experience: the chance to simultaneously relieve yourself while overhearing the complete psychological breakdown of a CS major or the passionate whispered rant of a political science student questioning capitalism.

**The Moffitt Experience**  
Picture this: You're seeking refuge in these tiled confessionals, when suddenly you become an unwitting therapist to the adjacent stall's occupant, who's softly crying about their Medieval Studies midterm while simultaneously ordering their third cold brew of the day. It's group therapy, but with dividers.

Notable Features:

* Exceptional acoustic properties for eavesdropping on academic crises
* Toilet paper that's somehow simultaneously single-ply yet pretentious
* The persistent aroma of FSM's coffee mixed with eau de anxiety
* Graffiti that ranges from quantum physics equations to existential poetry

Perfect for:

* Introverts seeking the parasocial comfort of others' academic despair
* Students needing material for their psychology papers
* Anyone wanting to hear unfiltered opinions about professors
* Those seeking the authentic college experience of crying in a bathroom

Pro tip: Peak drama hours occur during midterms and finals, when the bathrooms transform into confessionals for academic sins.

Privacy Rating: 4/10 (walls have ears)  
Entertainment Value: 8/10  
Therapeutic Potential: 7/10  
Coffee Proximity: 9/10

Warning: May accidentally become involved in someone's emotional breakthrough or spontaneous study group formation. Side effects include developing a pavlovian response to the sound of coffee grinders.

**(8) Stanley Hall** (8.5/10) - The Enlightened Throne

Location: Northwest campus, where bioengineering dreams take flight 

Built: 2007 

Primary Clientele: Distinguished professors who've forgotten where they parked their Teslas and grad students pretending they belong

Ah, Stanley Hall – the gleaming jewel in Berkeley's STEM crown, where the bathrooms are as pristine as the building's grant funding. While lesser facilities across campus struggle with basic functionality, Stanley's restrooms achieve a zen-like state of perfection that makes one question if they're still on a public university campus at all.

Perched majestically on the slope leading to the hallowed grounds of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanley Hall's facilities offer what can only be described as a spa-like experience for the academically enlightened. Here, one can contemplate the mysteries of protein folding or rehearse their Nobel acceptance speech in blessed solitude.

Notable Features:

* Pristine cleanliness that would impress a clean room technician
* Lighting that actually flatters instead of fluorescent-flickering your soul into submission
* Acoustic properties perfect for practicing your ""I just got published in Nature"" victory speech
* Water pressure consistent enough to be worthy of a PhD thesis

The true luxury lies in the silence. No mysterious pipes groaning like a failed experiment, no echoing sounds of academic despair – just the peaceful serenity of a bathroom that actually believes in your research potential.

Pro tip: Best visited during faculty meetings when the building's inhabitants are elsewhere debating the future of science

Cleanliness Rating: NIH funding/10 Meditation Potential: 9.5/10 Impostor Syndrome Reduction: 7/10

Warning: Extended use may make returning to lesser campus facilities emotionally challenging. May also result in unrealistic expectations for all future bathroom experiences.

**(9) Dwinelle Hall (9/10) - The Labyrinth's Hidden Oasis**

Location: Somewhere in the space-time continuum of Central Campus  
Architectural Style: M.C. Escher meets Kafka  
Built: In multiple dimensions simultaneously

Behold, the greatest plot twist in Berkeley's bathroom saga – Dwinelle Hall, where students enter seeking classrooms and exit questioning reality itself, somehow houses the campus's most surprisingly sublime sanctuaries. Like finding a five-star spa inside a quantum physics experiment, these facilities defy all expectations and possibly several laws of nature.

You'd think a building infamous for its non-Euclidean geometry and ability to make seniors cry would host bathrooms that match its chaotic energy. And yet, like a secret garden in a concrete maze, Dwinelle's restrooms stand as monuments to civil engineering done right.

Notable Features:

* Sensor-equipped sinks that dispense actually warm water (a miracle by UC standards)
* Pristine cleanliness that suggests a portal to an alternate dimension
* Gender-inclusive facilities that welcome all who've managed to find them
* A peaceful atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Berkeley's architectural fever dream

The true irony lies in the journey: while students spend hours lost in Dwinelle's twisted corridors trying to find their Comparative Literature seminar, those who stumble upon these bathrooms find themselves reluctant to leave. It's as if the building's chaos exists purely to protect these sacred spaces.

Pro tip: The challenge isn't finding a clean bathroom in Dwinelle – it's finding your way back to it once you've discovered it. Some say there's a bathroom so perfect it appears only to those who've given up hope of ever finding their classroom.

Navigation Difficulty: √-1/10  
Actual Facility Quality: 9/10  
Spiritual Enlightenment: 10/10  
Probability of Finding It Again: 3.14159/10

Warning: May result in developing Stockholm Syndrome with a building. Some visitors report emerging from Dwinelle bathrooms to find themselves in different academic years or parallel universes where their classes were actually scheduled in Evans Hall.



**CONCLUSION:** Fellow Bears, as we conclude this comprehensive analysis of Berkeley's finest (and most horrifying) facilities, let us remember the ancient medical wisdom passed down through generations of doctors: *""The bowels are the window to the soul, but a clean bathroom is the door to sanity.""* \- Hippocrates (probably)

As both a medical student and a Berkeley survivor, I can confidently say that the quality of one's daily constitutional directly correlates with academic performance. Just as every great physician must know their anatomy, every wise Berkeley student must know their bathroom geography.

From the blinding white abyss of Wheeler to the post-apocalyptic landscape of VLSB, from the proletariat porcelain of Unit 3 to the bourgeois brilliance of Blackwell, each facility tells a story. But perhaps the greatest lesson lies in Dwinelle Hall, where against all odds and architectural logic, paradise exists within chaos. It stands as a testament to that old medical school adage: *""The best bathroom is not the closest one, but the one worth walking to.""*

Remember, dear colleagues, in the words of my attending physician: *""Just as we must be selective with our diagnoses, we must be selective with our digestive sanctuaries.""* Choose wisely, for your GPA – and your gut – may depend on it.

Final Rankings and Diagnoses:

* Terminal Case: Pimentel Hall (2/10)
* Chronic Condition: VLSB (2/10)
* Stable but Guarded: Wheeler Hall (3/10)
* Showing Signs of Life: Evans Hall (4/10)
* Ready for Discharge: Latimer Hall (5/10)
* Fully Recovered: Stanley Hall (8.5/10)
* Miracle of Modern Medicine: Dwinelle Hall (9/10)

Prescriptive Advice: When in doubt, hold it and hike to Stanley or Dwinelle. Your future self will thank you for the exercise and the excellence.

Having just spent five weeks over there I think I finally figured it out. There’s the obvious, the women, the ladies, the nightlife, but it’s much more deeper than that. Here in the west, most specifically America, we become a custom to isolating ourselves. Everyone is stressed out, angry, rushed, and we’ve become immune to it. It’s just a normal way of life. Then you go to Thailand. Everyone is friendly, it doesn’t matter where you go, someone wants to strike up a conversation with you, There’s so many available women to go around, that dudes are high-fiving each other and getting along and there’s no competition.

Everyone is friendly, and eager to engage with you. Go to any pub, any grill, any bar, any venue and it don’t matter who sits down next to you? They’ll strike up a conversation with you and it’s a friendly one. You don’t see that much anymore in the United States. Everyone keeps to themselves. It’s like a step back in time. Then there’s the slight seediness of the place. The alleyways, the endless shops and places to eat, the smell in the air, or the food vendors etc. I would get up every morning and go to a little mama pop coffee shop. And crack jokes with the old lady who owned the place. She would give me a hug and a big smile. And was happy to see me as I was her. You don’t get that at Starbucks in America. You spend a few weeks over there and if you’re lucky a month like I did. You come back home and it hits you. You realize it got into your blood. A few weeks and start missing it. And thinking about it more and more.

The Thai culture may not have got everything perfect but I’ll tell you what when it comes to knowing how to live and smile and socialize, they definitely got that 100% right. The place taps into how humans were originally meant to interact with each other. Friendly, engaging, the women feminine, and accommodating, not all trying to share the same five men. Treat the women with respect and a touch of kindness and you’ll get 100 fold back. The mentality is what can they do for you? Not the other way around like it is in America. 

I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m going back to that place as fast as I can. And as often as I can.  ",6,1733192555.0,EverythingPattaya,1,1.0,False
1h5ctop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1h5ctop/pregnant_and_going_to_ochi_here_are_some_tips/,Pregnant and going to Ochi? Here are some tips.,"I was to preface this with the fact that we had a wonderful time overall! But I wish I would have known a few things before going. Also - if some things seem obvious, please be kind as this is my first pregnancy. This was also my first time at a Sandals. 

Let’s start with the positives! All the Sandals staff were extremely hospitable to the fact that I am pregnant and had trouble with stairs/food aversions/swelling feet. They went above and beyond to make sure that I was as comfortable as possible. One of the gift shops even gave us a dolphin plushie for free! They seemed genuinely excited to chitchat about their families and genuinely interested with our growing family. I was expecting some recognition as a pregnant person, but not service to this extent! 

They had no qualms about bringing me a different dish if one didn’t sit well (my aversions are not predictable - usually the food sounded amazing on the menu and when it arrived, my stomach just said “NOPE!”) and they were always amazing and never made me feel bad even though I hate wasting food. 

On top of that, it was the rainy season and the few times where I was going up/down stairs without my husband near me, very quickly would a staff member offer their arm or hand to  make sure I made it to the end of the staircase safely. 

Now the “negatives” - which is really just things I wish I would have known before and one real negative that Sandals did make right. 

THE STAIRS. Holy cow. There are so many stairs and elevators are not available everywhere. The building we stayed in had only two elevators that could comfortably fit two people but often people would squeeze 3-4 in. The last two days, one of those elevators were out of service and that was a pain but nothing that anyone could do about. I brought only a couple pairs of socks for our travel days and assumed I’d be in sandals the rest of the time but had to wash socks to wear my sneakers just to survive the stairs. 

The other odd thing is that there are a ton of bees. I’m not sure if this is a seasonal issue or not but it was just.. strange? They never stung anyone from what I could tell but I don’t especially care for bugs so that kind of made me uneasy. Since the lobbies are wide open, the bees tended to hang out at the coffee/tea stations. 

Part of our plan was my husband was going to do a scuba dive and I’d go to the spa and do the “mother to be” massage. We waited too long and my husband wasn’t able to book his dive but I had mentioned to one of the spa ladies that I might be interested in it and they did not let up even after I told them that I had changed my mind. 

Now the one true negative. There is an excursion company that is a separate company from Sandals. When we realized that the dive/spa plan wasn’t going to work out, we asked the woman at the desk if there was anything safe for me to do while pregnant. She of course offered a shopping tour, which really isn’t our cup of tea. Instead we hired a taxi to go get some local food (this was wonderful!) and then she also recommended Mystic Mountain. We should have looked it up before paying. It was $92/person and while I couldn’t do most of the rides (zip line, bobsled, roller coaster), she said there was a butterfly/hummingbird aviary and beautiful views for me while my husband did those rides. Sounded great to me! I don’t mind sitting out while he has the experiences and it would have been a nice way to get off the resort for a few hours. When we arrived, we were informed that we only had entry and my husband would not be able to ride any of the rides - okay, not great but we’d enjoy the aviary and views together… we were directed to the aviary and it was just a bench next to a couple of hummingbird feeders. The whole area was smaller than our room at the resort. The music was super loud so there was no way we’d even get a peak at and of those little creatures. There was also the scent of something that must have died in the woods nearby which did not help my nausea. We did walk around and enjoy the views. They do also have a pool we could have got in but there were a ton of kids in it playing - which is exactly what it’s for! But not great for relaxing. It just isn’t a great spot for a pregnant person. By the time we were done exploring, we still had two hours before our bus returned. It was disappointing since we paid nearly $200. My husband spoke with the woman at the excursion desk and she offered us a 20% refund. When we were leaving, the Sandals front desk manager asked us how everything was, so we mentioned it and they comped the whole excursion without question. We were not expecting anything at all. 

The only reason I bring this up is to hopefully save another pregnant person from the same mistake. 

I want to reiterate that we had a wonderful time overall! This is just from my perspective as a pregnant person! ",1,1733192471.0,SandalsResorts,0,1.0,False

Tea: White2Tea Machines of Loving Grace 2024 shou (7g mini)

Brewed at 100C, 100ml gaiwan, 2 rinses, 5-10s steeps.

Aroma had a bit of wodui but by the second wash that was mostly gone. Wet leaf aroma had a lot going on, some stonefruit notes and a bit of generic herbal, but the dominant one was butter and butterscotch. Never had this experience with a shou, it smelled like butterscotch candy with a tiny bit of browned butter on the back end. The liquor was much more mild. Developed into a more bready yeasty note as time went on.

Flavor on the first steeps was very earthy, with a slight almost coffee-like bitterness. Noticeable cooling effect in the mouth but no distinct menthol notes like Lumber Slut has. Still a very smooth tea with a nice mouthfeel, and the earthy notes are very deep and evolving. Smoothed out quite a bit in later steeps into a very balanced shou, lots of very subtle notes.

Overall this is a really nice shou, very well balanced and lots of subtle flavors. At this age and price I probably wouldn’t buy a cake, but I think some age would make this a really unique shou.",9,1733192370.0,puer,0,0.91,False

It's like the universe's way of balancing things out—where one love story ends, another can begin, preferably with me. So there I was today, sipping my espresso, scanning the room for anyone who might need a friendly ear or a shoulder to lean on.

That's when I noticed this young guy, probably a 3L law student, lugging around a stack of papers that looked thicker than a phone book. He seemed nervous, fidgeting with his tie and shuffling his notes. Behind him walked a seasoned lawyer, oozing confidence and clearly unfazed by whatever was about to go down in the courtroom.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to sit in on their case. Maybe one of the clients was a newly single woman open to some light conversation afterward. The case was over a modest $10k divorce—nothing that would normally grab headlines. The experienced lawyer looked almost bored, while the 3L acted like he was about to argue in front of the Supreme Court.

The kid handed over this massive 45-page brief, packed with block quotes and citations from unpublished opinions. Even I, with my limited legal knowledge, knew that wasn't standard procedure for such a minor case. The judge raised an eyebrow but remained patient, probably remembering his own early days.

As the proceedings continued, it was clear the 3L was in over his head. He started to argue with the judge—a bold move for someone who hasn't even passed the bar yet. The seasoned lawyer just leaned back, a slight smirk on his face, waiting for the inevitable conclusion.

Meanwhile, I couldn't help but feel a mix of second-hand embarrassment and opportunity. The courtroom had a few attendees, including a woman who seemed particularly stressed—perhaps the client or a relative. She might appreciate a kind word after witnessing this less-than-stellar performance.

The judge gently corrected the 3L, suggesting he revisit some fundamentals and perhaps consider an appeal if he felt so inclined. The kid looked deflated, his ego taking a visible hit. The case wrapped up quickly after that, the seasoned lawyer gathering his things and likely already thinking about his next big client.

As everyone started to disperse, I saw my chance. I approached the woman I'd noticed earlier. ""Tough day in court, huh?"" I offered with a sympathetic smile.

She sighed, ""You have no idea.""

""Sometimes it's helpful to decompress over a cup of coffee,"" I suggested. ""My treat?""

She looked at me for a moment, perhaps weighing the offer. Then she nodded. ""You know what, that sounds nice.""

And just like that, a door opened. Divorce court might be the end of the road for some, but for me, it's a place full of new beginnings. After all, every ending is just a new opportunity waiting to unfold.",0,1733192333.0,LawSchool,5,0.42,False

I have a 5 year old long haired domestic cat (F, neutered, NOT declawed). I noticed lately that she’s been running from me and running under tables lately when I attempt to pet her. She likes to have her belly rubbed and often lays on her back and presents her belly to people for a rub. Well my roommate and I were in the kitchen this evening when she showed her belly, so I went over and attempted to rub her belly. She immediately ran off under one of the coffee tables, so I’m guessing she wanted my roommate to rub her belly and not me…… :( she still comes and lays in bed with me for a few minutes 1-3 times throughout the night, which is normal behavior for her, but won’t let me pet her. I don’t think anything has changed lately and am now convinced my cat hates me. I do have two other cats (3F, 6M, both fixed, both have claws) and I don’t see anything has changed with them or the overall dynamic there either. 😅🤣 any suggestions or thoughts?

Edited to add: literally right after I posted this, she hopped up in bed with me, sprawled out on her side, and let me rub her face and belly. 🤨 

Another edit: I heard a few minutes after she left my room that she went by my roommate and laid on her back and let him rub her belly. What the heck!!!! Also I realized the only thing that’s changed lately is that I’m not giving them a little wet food/wet pureed treat in the mornings anymore. (I was for a while bc I was attempting to medicate one of my cats with liquid meds mixed into the wet food and felt bad, so all 3 got a morning treat.)

1h5coy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h5coy6/ive_had_two_appointments_and_only_10_minutes_of/,I've had two appointments and only 10 minutes of discussion. Why did this happen and what can I do?,"I (36M) had one of the worst experiences and I am not sure what to do about it. I had two neurology appointments and was seen for 10 minutes each time. 5 minutes allocated to a physical test he administered during both appointments. So 5 minutes of actual discussion for each appointment. I dont know why I deserve such dismissive behavior. Whether it was something that I did or it has to do with the type of insurance I have. I am just trying to figure out what I am supposed to do next. I hope you all can provide some guidance. 

**SYMPTOMS**

I obtained a referral to a neurologist for tremors that began a year or so ago. They only occur when moving a muscle, not at rest. They effect every muscle in my body. The tremors happened overnight and were accompanied by several other symptoms, notably a complete change in my mental health. I have zero motivation, extreme executive dysfunction, memory loss. I am completely disorganized. Its like my ADHD was dialed to 11. My adderall has lost its effectiveness overnight. Coffee no longer works. It feels like something happened to my brain and I am trying to figure out if the tremors are related to it. Additionally, I have weight loss and loss of appetite that has began over the last few months so I am not sure if that is related. It seems like my body is falling apart.

**BACKSTORY**

My appointment was booked 3 months out. On the day of the appointment I was a bit late due to getting blocked in while trying to park in their lot, so I had to park a half mile away. As a result I was only able to see the doctor for about 10 minutes which is totally understandable, my fault. He performed a quick test but nothing really stood out to him. He said the tremors were likely due to my thyroid (I had a few thryroid tests the following week) and told me to come back for a follow up after I get my thyroid testing done. They book me out another 3 months.

During the second appointment, he starts with the same test as last time and sees nothing conclusive. We rule out the thyroid since the tests came back fine so I ask him what else it could be. He mentions that my heart rate is high again (see edit) and that the tremors are likely due to my adderall use. I tell him that I dont believe that is the case since I have been on it for over 15 years and no one has ever brought up my heart rate until now. I also inform him that I have discontinued my adderall use several times and the tremors remained unchanged. I even tell him that I did not take adderall for 6 months at the beginning of this year and still had the tremors but he doesnt really say anything. I then mention that I met with a neurologist a year ago and they had asked me to get an MRI but due to having to move home for a bit and changing insurances, I never followed up on it. He tells me that they did not request an MRI (im guessing he can see my records) and says he doesnt think that I need one. I know for a fact they requested one because I remember talking with insurance about payment for it. Why would he say this? I bring this up and he says fine, I will send in a request but they rarely get approved by insurance. 

At this point he seems standoffish and dismissive. He starts to pack up some of his things and I continue explaining some symptoms that I find relevant. I tell him that the tremors get worse when my heart rate is elevated. For example, during intense exercise or a high stress moment when playing a video game. He says ""yeah, heart rate, its probably the adderall"", with a smirk. At this point he is standing up and starting to walk out. Keep in mind, I have only been there for 10 minutes, 5 of which were part of the physical test. I was so shocked that I just let it happen. No discussion was had on potential causes for my symptoms. I received zero guidance. He barely asked me any questions. He just stood up, said lets follow up in 3 months and walked out. No goodbye, no next steps, nothing. I dont even have any comments or an after visit summary in my portal.

Is it normal to only be seen for 10 minutes for this sort of thing? I dont know if it was something I did (see edit) or perhaps he just thinks its not that serious? Maybe it has to do with my medicaid insurance? I have to wait months in between appointments just to be seen for 10 minutes? I just feel completely defeated. These tremors just appeared overnight, along with several other symptoms. Like something triggered them. I had to quit my job because of them! Which is also why I am on medicaid. I am just devastated that whats happening to me is serious enough to cause me to quit my job yet I only get 10 minutes of his time. 

I dont know what to do. I want to complain but I am not sure what good that will do. I was also thinking that I could maybe send him a message in the portal explaining how serious this is and provide as much information as I can. Maybe he will understand? I guess another option is to find someone else but I would likely have to wait another 3 months. This is a total nightmare.

Edit: On the first appointment, he mentioned that my heart rate was high. This is the first time I have been told this so I just chalked it up to me having to run to the office due to getting stuck in the parking lot. During the second appointment (arrived on time), he brings my heart rate up again. I tell him I had to run to the office again since I got the cancellation call just an hour ago and had to park far away. Perhaps he just thinks I am abusing adderall or something due to the running? Maybe he thinks im just making excuses? This is honestly the only thing I can think of that could explain the dismissive behavior, other than maybe the insurance.",1,1733192076.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
