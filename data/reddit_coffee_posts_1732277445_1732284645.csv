I feeeels like there should be a thermal carafe that fits the KBGV, but I can’t seem to work it out. Would rather upgrade than buy a new machine if possible…

1gx8jdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gx8jdr/coffee_and_chronical_pain/,Coffee and chronical pain,"Hi people, so I’ll start with a intro to my coffeine history. About a month ago I came home to my parents after drinking 2 cups of americano a day for half a year and before that about 15 years or so on caffeinated drinks basically every day. I’ve had a few months long break two years ago which I really enjoyed, then ever since I slipped into the habit again I haven’t taken a proper break since. When I came to my parents the urge to have coffee disappeared due to me being used to brewing high quality americanos at home, whereas dad’s filter coffee didn’t tempt me at all anymore since the taste wasn’t sufficient for me. 

Then I’ll tell a bit about my life when it comes to pain. When I turned about 12 years old, I started feeling bodily pain lingering first in the neck, then down to my back, arms and legs. Before I knew it, my whole body was filled with a nonstop feeling of pain. My sleep got poor, my focus was wracked and my sense of self got lost within handling the pain. The next 8-10 years was then filled with extreme sports, gaming, masturbation, sex and drugs(The last two from I was around 18.), alot because it numbed the pain. Then when I was around 22-23 I had multiple serious psychoses ending up in both Police arrest and forced psychiatric treatment for my own safety. I had a breakdown trying to get rid of almost everything I owned, as well as saying goodbye to most of my friends, including childhood friends. This was an attempt to force a restart in my life. After this, my life actually started to change. I got into treating my body with healthy habits and my sense of self increased as I felt like I was more alive than ever, atleast in the past 10 years. I am now still feeling continuously improvement, but the pain has remained the same. I am now 27 yrs old. I have a very active job as a mountain guide hiking about 10km with 500m elevation gain five times each week on average from May to October. I also do weight training, daily yoga and other sports. Another factor is my sleeping habits, since the time my pain started to this day I believe my average sleep time is between 4-6 hours a night. Since I stopped coffeine a month ago, I tried to match it with improving my sleeping habits. The past month I’ve been getting 7-9 hour sleep on average. 

The first two-three weeks  without coffeine was filled with extreme headaches, low mood and anxiety, but luckily it turned in the fourth week making me feel more balanced again. I am now out traveling for five months in SE Asia, and the first days here have been wonderful. However, yesterday I had a double shot americano around noon which made me shift into this other type of person in just half an hour. I felt my heartbeat racing, my mind being unable to settle and I had an overall unpleasant feeling lingering within me. I had noticed before this that my sense of reality was heightened, stress levels was very low and my mood was quite stable except some down-peaks throughout the day. Then later in the evening I was lucky to have my friend and her friend invite me to karaoke, which I enjoyed full heartedly. Then again, I got a coke in front of me and thought I’d take it as a thank you for bringing it even though I thought it wasn’t the best idea. The karaoke night was still a beautiful night, but when I got home I was unable to focus on going to bed, neither did I fall asleep until 4am. Then today, at around 3pm, I took another coke just because I felt like I’ve had a hangover or something, when in reality it was probably mostly the sleep and coffeine since I was sober the whole time. 

So, if you’ve come this far I thank you for listening to me.  Have anyone dealt with chronic pain and experienced improvement?",1,1732284186.0,decaf,0,0.99,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1gx8h4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1gx8h4t/eu_citizen_in_poverty_living_outside_of_eu_please/,EU citizen in poverty living outside of EU. Please help me.,"EU citizen here, where to move in EU? Help me get up on my feet.

Hello, I am 20 years old, EU citizen, currently living in deep poverty in one of the most expensive non-EU country, Switzerland, I came here before I reached puberty against my will. I am struggling to live here because I'm working a minimum wage job and healthcare system is very expensive for me, public transport is also very expensive aswell as my apartment, all that on a minimum wage, super difficult to find a job aswell, it wasn't this difficult before, people on minimum wage were able to live okay, care free life. I can't get free education either, during my childhood because I didn't know German properly yet (now I speak it perfectly) i was unable to succeed with better grades at school to work a better paying job. 

Now I can't get out of this poverty easily because as a foreigner without permanent residence (right wing politics huraay) I can't get any social help or special benefits otherwise I can lose my visa and get deported. I have no way to save up any money, maybe if I just remove my internet, buy food in Germany in Lidl etc I can save a little bit but it will take me some time. Living in poverty in Switzerland as a foreigner is a huge red flag, they don't want us here so there's that, I just know I will HAVE to move out in the next 3 years before my visa expires, I can't handle this anymore. So I want to check my options. 

I learn languages fast now and can speak German, Croatian and English at the moment. As soon as I find a country I plan to move to, I will immediately start to learn the language, so I'm ready for that.

1. I need a country in EU in which I have a possibly of free or at least cheap education with possibly to work part time on the side.
2. Affordable housing to find, would love to live in a smaller more rural place, don't mind traveling to school and work. Keep in mind I will have a tight budget as a student so as cheap as it is possible I would appreciate it. I don't care too much about the size or quality as long as I have a roof over my head and safety. 
3. Maybe a good country that will support me as an EU citizen to get back on my legs, educate myself with part time work and also have good chances to find a better job later when I finish my education. 

To work part time, currently I only have experiences with harder working jobs like big mail shipping, similar to Amazon, I have experiences in facory work with food and drinks aswell as retail in grocery store. I would avoid working at restaurants or coffee bars, night clubs and similar stuff. Gardening, logistics and stuff that anyone can learn without experience I'm open to aswell, just so I can work something that will bring me some money for basics. Even picking potatoes on the field or fruits and vegetables, why not.

Education I'm interested in is electricity stuff working as an electrician, postman/mailman, train, bus or tram driver, I'm most interested in electromechanical school, I wanted to do that in Switzerland but they rejected me because I didn't have enough good grades on my diploma. System here is that in secondary school (age 14-16y) I have to be A class meaning I have to have perfect grade, highest is 6, acceptable is 5 but I had 4 which wasn't enough. Keep in mind these grades literally have nothing to do with my love and knowledge on electromechanics, not related to eachother at all. Now to start all over here is super expensive for me.

Of course I would love to go on a higher educational rank one day like an engineer but it's a long lasting education and I don't want to live struggling to get by too long. So electromechanics it is. 
If any EU country would accept me in their military or civil work in exchange for education and place to stay I'm all for it. Literally ANYTHING. I would be a great citizen, I integrate well anywhere, I don't have any criminal past, I'm European white non muslim if that's important too (I know some countries care sadly), I don't care about the culture I'm accepting very well and I can fit in easily and learn language quickly. I just want a secure affordable place to live, don't care where and how it looks like, education and a job. I just want to have a normal life and become something. Thank you.


**Edit:** My living conditions in any EU country don't have to be perfect or desirable as long as I can have free or cheap education, I will have more hope in my life because it will be over, I'll have my diploma and be able to relax later, I'm ready for temporary discomfort and to struggle a bit in exchange for a better long lasting future.

Now that it’s getting cold it’s even nicer.

But creamer is loaded with calories, especially the amount I use. About 500 cals per cup if I guessed right.

I can do the fasting, I can do the counting calories, I can do the cardio. But I want my freaking creamer man, it warms my soul

Im also quitting nicotine atm- the coffee+vape combo was so perfectly amazing. I was fine a few weeks ago when I cut the vape out, but not having the coffee makes me kinda upset. Drinking it black, or with a normal serving of creamer, is not the same.

Now todays my first day off since counting calories and Im debating if the creamer is worth me having less food later. Idrc about food, I just want my cozy morning cup of warmth.

1gx8en6,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1gx8en6/lowered_my_a1c_in_three_months/,Lowered my A1C in three months! ,"I was at a steadily rising 5.7 (too close for comfort with a hx of diabetes in the family) and got to work and now I’m down to 5.2!! 

I was already a somewhat active and healthy eater before but after wearing a CGM realized it was less about what I was eating and more about when I was eating it. I used to be a late night snacker EVERY night - again nothing crazy unhealthy but it caused my blood sugar to go on a rollercoaster every night and was actually causing hypoglycemic episodes that I would then over treat during the day with juice etc. 


Things I shifted:
- cutting out late night snacking and letting that be the norm. I still do occasionally like maybe once a week max. 

- moving after I eat. I used to slip into a delicious post meal coma like state after eating and just veg out and “digest”. I wasn’t actually digesting at all and was majorly spiking. So now I hop up, tidy up the house, grab laundry from the basement, dishes etc. anything I can. I don’t have a problem moving if I’m out and about but eating at home can be challenging sometimes if the weather is bad/it’s dark etc. A post meal walk is ideal though! 

- I started making my own protein ice cream at home so that I didn’t feel like I was missing out. I have mastered a chickfila peppermint milkshake dupe as well as a mint chocolate chip ice cream. 

- protein in general. I did an alright job at adding protein in before but not enough. I aim for 30 g per meal 

- mindful snacks. While I do snack a little less than before, I make sure what I’m reaching for isn’t completely loaded with carbs. I keep chocolate covered skinny almonds, dates to dip in PB, string cheese, laughing cow cheese, turkey pepperoni, veggies and ranch, and I will even have a couple of servings of regular potato chips each week but I dip them in plain non fat Greek yogurt. You can add ranch powder to make it feel like a store bought dip. 

- here was the big adjustment. I aimed for 30g max of NET carbs per meal and under 20 per snack. I wasn’t doing a ton of carbs before anyway, but this was a game changer for me. I know low carb doesn’t work for everyone but it makes me feel great. We just went to Disney and I had a third of a pastry every morning but I also paired that with hard boiled eggs and turkey bacon. 

- another hack I’ve been doing for awhile is if I want coffee from a Starbucks or something, I get only one pump of REGULAR syrup in an almond milk latte. So delish. Sugar free will spike you more (which I’ll get to in a min). 

- avoiding some ingredients such as maltodextrin. This ingredient is in so many “sugar free” items and holds double the glycemic index of sugar. It should be criminal to withhold that information but now you know. Anything with “dext” in it - you’re better off eating a smaller portion of the thing you want, which is exactly what I do. I.E. all sugar free ice cream has maltodextrin in it or sugar alcohol which irritates my body so I just get a kids scoop of ice cream if I’m out in public or make my own at home 

- cheat days where I don’t worry about counting BUT eyeballing portions. Because of the aforementioned changes, I don’t even want to eat recklessly anymore. 

- ditching long fasts and eating in the morning. I started listening to Dr Stacey sims who has excellent advice for active women. Fasting is great for men but women should be eating within 45 minutes of waking up and within 45 mins of working out. At least 15g of protein upon waking. I actually lost almost 10 lbs over these last few months by eating more. 

- continued strength/resistance training with minimal cardio bursts. Like I said, I was already pretty active but really needed these other lifestyle tweaks to see the fruits of my labor. 

TL;DR 
it’s not about eliminating the things you love to eat it’s about finding a healthier alternative/dupe OR enjoying the regular food in moderation AND moving your dang body around for a minimum of 10 minutes after eating. 

If anyone wants tips about snacks or sweets let me know and I’ll include my arsenal 🥳

Arthur wanted to tell Nettie everything. He longed to tell her about the Society, about how they had unceremoniously wrenched him out of his ordinary life and forced him into servitude to them. He had spent more than a year with this secret bubbling inside of him, with no confidant but Jack. Telling the stories to the internet brought him little relief, for no one truly believed—or if they did, they thought only about the monsters, and not the man who had been trapped.

He could unburden himself. He could tell her the entire story. He could share the fear and inhumanity, the nightmares that dragged him from reality to force their ghoulish tales upon him. He could even share the truly dark side of it all: that he liked the acclaim and the notoriety. Beneath the wash of terror that came with every glimpse of the Gentlefolk was an insidious current of pride. The monsters respected him. They needed him. He was important.

If he told Nettie all of that, he could share the mental load. She could support him, understand him. She could help anchor him to humanity, to stop him being swept away into the sickening morass that was the Society—as long as she believed him.

The odds that she would believe him were low, though. The story was objectively insane. She would most likely assume that he was making it up for some reason. Worse, she might think that he believed it, and was therefore mentally unwell. Either way, it would leave Arthur worse off than he was now. He would still be alone, and he would have torpedoed his potential relationship. In addition, she’d laid down the ground rules at the beginning: if they gave it a shot and things didn’t work out, he would no longer be welcome to drink at Venn’s. He’d lose his easy spot rooted in the center of humanity.

Even though he ached to share his secret, the risk was too great. There was no reason for her to believe him. He couldn’t take that chance. Certainly not on the second date.

“The coffee was Jack’s idea,” Arthur said instead. It was an offering, a suggestion for her to test the waters surrounding his secret. A way to ease in.

Nettie accepted the invitation, though with a rather more pointed question than Arthur had expected. “Did he plan this date?”

“No! My ideas are my own. Jack is just a facilitator.”

“How does that work?”

“He makes things easier. Whatever I need, he smooths the path. I never asked for this samovar, or for him to do anything for this date. He…anticipates.”

“Hm.” Arthur watched Nettie consider this. “Well, the introduction to the date has certainly been smooth. Spotless apartment, excellent coffee, handsome attire. Shall we move away from the influence of your manservant and see how you do on your own?”

“It’s harder than that to get away from Jack’s influence,” Arthur said. “But yes, let’s make our way to dinner. I picked an Ethiopian place downtown.”

“Why Ethiopian?” Nettie asked as they made their way to the car.

“Two reasons. It’s new in town, so it won’t be one of the local restaurants that you have ‘thoughts’ on. I’d hate to stumble at the very first test you set.”

“This is far from the first test! It’s just the first one that I specifically called out as such. And I’m not certain you haven’t stumbled yet, though your reasoning so far is good. What’s the second reason?”

“The food looks delicious,” said Arthur.

Nettie laughed. “I don’t know why I expected something deeper. Let’s go find out if you’re right!”

Dinner was indeed delicious. The restaurant ambiance was perfect, with soft lighting and unobtrusive service. They talked familiarly and held hands across the table in between courses. It was both exhilarating and comfortable at the same time. Arthur allowed himself to become lost in the moment, setting aside his worries and simply enjoying the evening.

Over a postprandial glass of wine, Nettie said, “I read your stories the other day.”

Arthur stiffened and tried to hide it. Keeping his voice casual he asked, “Which ones?”

“The first ones to come up on the blog. I didn’t dig too deeply yet. ‘Dark Art’ is clever, by the way.”

“Jack again, I’m afraid. I was just writing the stories. He’s the one who managed to bring the blog to people’s attention.”

“Still. There’s a lot to bring attention to.”

“Thank you.”

“The monsters, though.” Nettie shook her head. “Some of those are going to stick with me. You’ve got a lot going on in your head.”

*But do you believe me?* Arthur wanted to ask. *Are you willing to think it might be true?*

Instead, he said, “The stories are how I get them out.”

Nettie swirled her wine and looked thoughtfully at Arthur. “Do you, though? Get them out?”

“It helps, at least.”

She shook her head. “That’s not quite right, and I don’t know exactly why. I’m not sure you do, either. We’re closer to your secret again, though.”

*It’s all true.* Arthur thought it with such force that for a moment he thought he’d said it out loud. Nettie was still gazing intently at him, however, and her lack of reaction made it clear that he had not actually spoken.

“I’ll tell you if you want,” said Arthur.

“But do *you* want?” asked Nettie.

*Desperately*, thought Arthur. The moment hung in the air. He said nothing, and smiled to cover the silence.

Nettie smiled in return. “You need something. From me, from yourself, from the world. Do you even know what it is?”

“Talking to you is like getting my palm read sometimes,” said Arthur.

Nettie laughed. “Doesn’t mean I’m wrong, though.”

She took his hand again, and for a moment Arthur thought that she was indeed going to read his palm. Instead she laced her fingers through his and gave him a gentle squeeze. Arthur held her hand, enjoying the warmth of her skin, and let the intensity of the previous moment slip away.

It was late by the time they returned to Arthur’s apartment. As they parked, Nettie asked, “Walk me to my car? I’m just over there.”

“I can’t entice you to come inside, then?”

“Not tonight. But I’ve had a lovely time.”

“As have I,” said Arthur. They reached her car, and he drew her in for a long kiss. She wrapped her arms around him, pulling him closer. He pressed her against her car. They let their bodies take over, pushing all thought aside.

A long minute later, they broke apart. The look in Nettie’s eye was hungry.

“Sure you won’t come inside?” asked Arthur.

She ran a fingernail down his chest, parallel to the buttons of his shirt. “Tempting. But no.”

“No, you’re not sure?”

She laughed and pushed gently at his chest. “Nice try.”

“Worth a shot.”

“I’m working tomorrow night. Will I see you?”

“I’ll be there,” Arthur promised her.

He watched her drive away. The idea of going to his apartment, of sitting down and quietly going to sleep, was almost an affront. He was keyed up with need and desire, emotional and sexual and spiritual all at once. He did not know *what* he needed. He only knew *that*.

An escape. A distraction. A solution. Anything to take him out of himself.

A car purred quietly up next to Arthur. The window was down. Jack was in the driver’s seat.

“This is a mistake, sir,” said Jack.

“What is?” said Arthur.

“Calling a meeting of the Society. You do not need this.”

“How am I calling it?”

“I couldn’t say, sir. But you are.” There was a long pause before Jack added, “You can stop this.”

After another long pause, Arthur climbed into the back seat of the car. “Drive.”

They rode in silence. Arthur expected disappointment from Jack, but the mood he felt instead was closer to sadness. It was unexpected and strangely infuriating.

He said nothing and let the anger roil. It was a cleaner sensation than the confusing need.

Jack parked the car outside of a large field surrounded by a chain-link fence. A massive foundation was poured in the center of the field, the concrete base for some never-built structure. A bonfire was roaring in the center of this slab. The shapes of the Gentlefolk shifted and warped in the erratic light. The shadows they cast reached out with demanding desire, drawing Arthur in.

The Fleshraiser stood before the fire, waiting. He nodded as Arthur took his seat.

“My story, as promised. Something different than what you have heard here before. I will not brag as these others do. I do not want your horror and your thoughts.”

There was a discordant hiss from the crowd, a general noise of disapproval from a thousand malformed throats. The Fleshraiser raised his hand.

“I am a member of this Society, reluctantly or not. I claim my time to speak.”

He waited until the hubbub died down, and the only sound was the raging crackle of the fire. “I will use my story to caution you away. I know you feel you cannot leave. You can, though the price would be high. Let me speak to you as someone who truly cannot.”

I am using the level 2 charging cable that came with the Bolt to charge. I plugged it in to charge overnight and came out this morning to a car that didn’t charge up. No errors. I double checked last night and everything was green, delayed charging happily set up. Anyways, moved on to round two. Plugged in again after getting coffee, the car is saying it will take about 16(?) hours to charge to 100%… this seems, excessive. 

This is a charger we have been using for two years during the summer without issue. 50 amps available, though the charger is obviously capable of only 32 amps. 

Two questions: 
1. Is there a way to see in real time exactly how much juice is going into the battery right now? I.e. 7kw, 6kw, 5… just, data.

2. Am I suddenly doing something wrong after 2.5 years with my car? The only thing out of the ordinary that I never do was that I charged at a public spot yesterday and had to do a charge override to get the vehicle to charge immediately versus on the normal delay.

1gx8clg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gx8clg,New update of my last post. ,"I uploaded this before. 
After took space for a week, i gave my bf chance, i forgave him and set boundaries. He unfollowed people (especially women) that he really not closed or know them. Also imhe unfollowed a woman that he took screenshot of her photos.

But until yesterday, My boyfriend had a coffee event out of town. I know he really enjoys talking to new people, especially since he owns a coffee shop business.

But since yesterday, he has been replying to my WhatsApp messages with dry texts. He hasn’t even asked how my day was—I’m the only one who always asks him about his.

I tried to be understanding because I know he had a competition during the event. I thought maybe he wanted to focus on that.

But then I saw an Instagram story posted by some companies attending the event. The post showed people doing taste tests. However, in the background, I noticed my boyfriend talking and laughing with a woman (the same woman whose photo he had screenshotted.)

I felt uncomfortable about it.

Why is he still making an effort to talk to a woman I know he’s physically attracted to?

I haven’t fully recovered from what I found on his phone two weeks ago. But he seems so happy talking to her.

When we are talking about it, i think it will be the End of our relationship. Since i cant see he is really understanding what i feel when i see him still like to talk to her.

Sometimes i think, maybe these are signs from God that i’ve been praying for..

Then in 2023 I got diagnosed with ADHD and started medication right away. I had to try like 3 different medications in the spam of five months because all of them triggered my PVCs, but they stopped once I stop taking the meds and I only took each meds for 2 or 3 days max. In August of 2024 they prescribed me ""Elvanse"" as a last resource. I started taking them in September and  I didn´t had PVCs at first. But after 2 days taking them the PVCs started, so I had to stop the medication. The PVCs episodes lasted a few days and I kept going on with my normal life (drinking one cup of coffee per day and drinking alcohol at parties) but then I started to notice the PVCs didn´t went away. I had to completely quit coffee and alcohol, which helped a lot with PVCs and ADHD. But my problem now is that whenever I have my period or I get sick absoutely every medication causes me PVCs. I can not even take Paracetamol (  **Tylenol** ) . After using meds for period cramps the PVCs last for a week or two and they seem to get worse with any other natural medication or tea (without caffeine) I take. I´m going insane because I´ve been taking natural sleeping pills ( that contain melatonin, passionflower, valerian) since I was 16 because of my ADHD and If I don´t take them I get pretty bad insomnia.

  
I went to the doctors like 3  times since September and they did an ecography of my heart and apparently it is very healthy. They also run blood tests of my tyroides and potassium levels and everything seems to be at normal. Yet I think in 3 moths I´ve only had 2 days free of PVCs. Does anyone has gone through something similar? What could help me?

1gx8bx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1gx8bx7/a_quick_update_on_the_crazy_pastor_guy/,A quick update on the crazy pastor guy,"So, I doubt anyone reading this remembers a post I made months ago, so I'll just repeat the story. 

There's a Pentecostal group that I used to hang out with quite a bit because I had nothing better to do. I didn't agree with their beliefs at all, but they were friendly enough. 

Once I was downtown with them while they were evangelizing. I wasn't actually evangelizing with them, but I was just kind of following them around and keeping my distance. Some random guy came up to me and started evangelizing directly to me, so I tried to make it clear that I was technically with the group, and didn't need to be evangelized to as I already got the gist of it, But he didn't seem to believe me. I don't know if someone in the group told him I wasn't a Christian or something. Regardless, when he asked me why I wasn't a Christian, I just told him it was the concept of Hell, and this seemed to really catch him off guard. The discussion felt a little bit more natural from there, and he told me he was apparently a pastor. 

A few months later I was at the Pentecostal group and I was just standing outside, kind of questioning if I still wanted to be a part of the group or not and suddenly the same guy approached me. I hadn't seen him since the previous incident, and honestly I was really questioning if he actually was a pastor because he was just behaving very bizarrely. He asked me where someone was- A woman who was evealgalizing the previous time, And I said I didn't know and don't think I saw her since the previous incident either.

The pastor responded with: 

""Oh. She's very beautiful isn't she?""

I physically cringed, before deciding the best possible response was simply: ""Okay.""

""Yeah. But she's married though, isn't she?""

I had to think about it, before I said: ""Yes, I think she is.""

He then asked me if I was a Christian now since I was at the group. Quite an annoying question since I had tried to make it clear I was part of the group the previous time we talked, so I just responded with: ""No, not really.""

The pastor had a more exaggerated response to this than I anticipated, asking me what was it I possibly needed, and whether I needed Jesus himself to come down and talk to me. 

Knowing it wasn't worth it to get into this discussion, I just said I didn't want to talk about it. 

As the group was ending for the night, someone was in desperate need of a ride home, so I offered him one. Little. Did I know that this meant the pastor would be coming with us too- Yay.

We stopped at Tim Hortons and the pastor ordered a double double and then was very upset when it resulted in coffee, claiming he needed to go to sleep tonight. Regardless, we decided not to go through the drive-thru again, and there was some person who is half naked in the parking lot with a shopping cart, and the other guy decided he wanted to go talk to him. I knew if I drove away, it was just going to take him off, so I simply pulled over where I was and let him out. A few minutes later, he came back simply shouting: ""Repent!"" As we drove away, the guy was rolling in the parking lot, probably having some sort of reaction to something he was on, but the guy simply claimed he was probably repenting before Jesus, or suffering from a demonic attack. 

As we were driving home, they were both talking about something the pastor from the group was talking about, and how apparently a few years ago he thought he was going to lose his house and all of his money and stuff like that, and the pastor declared: ""How could you be so calm? Like your wife is going to leave you with that!""

They also talked about how apparently one of the quotes said today was how great men are forged through fire or something, and the other guy was apparently completely mind blown by this quote shouting: ""WWWOOOOWWW! FORDGED THROUGH FIIIIRE BRO!""

When I finally dropped them off, the pastor told me to keep reading my Bible, before seeming to correct himself. When he remembered I didn't agree with his beliefs, resulting in probably the most real interaction I ever had with him where he just said: ""Oh, wait, sorry, I forgot, you're not... Well, anyway, hope you have a goodnight.""

That was where the story ended last time, but I did end up exchanging numbers with him, and about a week later, he randomly messaged me asking if I wanted to meet up, because: ""I know you don't have much fellowship in your life.""

I was rather annoyed by this remark, as he had no reason to assume that I didn't have any sort of social life. I didn't voice my frustration with this though, and simply said that I was willing to hang out, but I wanted to make it clear that if we did meet up, I didn't want it to be under the pretense of him trying to convert me, as that would simply be a waste of time and make make the environment quite awkward. He seems to understand, but then he didn't actually follow up with any plans to meet, and I didn't hear from him again. 

At least, I didn't hear from him again until 6 months had gone by, and he sent me a text asking who I was as I was in his contacts. I clarified who I was, and he just didn't respond.

What she's done might be sh---y, but I still love her and care about her deeply.

For context, my native language (which I won't name, to maintain my anonymity) has some pretty spicy swear-words and curses. The kinda that would make the Family Guy writers blush.

One of them is very specifically aimed at ""god"". Imagine something like ""f--- god"" but 5 times more offensive. The swear isn't that common, and mostly older ppl use it. I picked it up from my grandpa. After I left the faith, I became comfortable using it. In fact, it a part of my deconstruction journey, knowing that I've unlearnt Christianity and its toxic beliefs to such an extent that I'm not afraid to blaspheme God anymore.

(TBH, the curse isn't aimed at any one god specifically. But when you're in Christianity, the Biblical God is the only God you're rly considering, and that stays w/ you for some time after leaving.)

And honestly, I'd come to a point where I rly don't care about the curse. I'm saying it just so, randomly. Not bcz I'm mad, and not bcz I'm mad at some specific god; just 'cause, y'know?

So, she (29F) and I (27M) were on a coffee. And somewhere along the line (I'm not sure when), I uttered the curse. I didn't think too much of it; in fact, I didn't realize I've uttered it. Until later that day, when she called me out for that.

Said she can't be friend with someone who blasphemes God. That she has some standards.

And that's it. Our 5-yr friend is just gone.

Said she was deeply disappointed, ""why cuss at God if he doesn't exist?"" (note: I'm not an atheist. Told her multiple times. But she doesn't tell the difference between ""non-believer"" and ""atheist"" apparently), and that what I said was IQ 60.

What saddens me more than anything is that she spoke without a hint of emotion. Coldly, as if w/ an enemy. Didn't even wanna say a real goodbye. But rather, ""if this thing changes w/ you, let me know. Until then, bye.""

JUST BCZ I SAID A CUSS WORD????????

Wild priorities of some Christians out there. The Church is rife with adultery, harassment, complacency, hatred, greed and fraud. BUT NO! We must attack random ppl when they cuss at god!

They don't care about righteousness. If they did, they'd do a better job at calling out, oh, I don't know, Steve Anderson for pounding his child's head open? Or Trump. Or any of the thousands of pastors in America who were exposed as fraudulent scum. Or the ""extremists"" who support death penalty for LGBTQ+ people.

But nah - I guess cusses are way worse than child abuse!",2,1732282709.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False

We've been 9 months now and 4 months living together, it's been great! And we were talking a lot about marrying and having children in the future. I want to understand the most important things to consider that are more fundamental for an ENFJ to be ever hole in a relationship.

The things I understand that are ENFJ essentials: (correct me if is not a thing of ENFJ)

-Help her to save the world, caring about stray animal, is the way.

-She's cares about the feelings of everyone, ""Everyone is important"". Also, caring about the people she loves is the way.

-She has a core and structured sense of justice and cares about people social structure. In this sense, respect is the way.

-The thing that really make her whole in an any job or hobby is recognition, really hard task, but I think helping her with a vision of the steps to make goals true is the way.

-She likes to talk a lot, lucky for me, she doesn't mind that I don't talk much. I like just listening to her. I try not to be dry (INTJ personality). But it seems dry humor is a way of humor too. Be interested about any topic is the way, very easy for INTJ buddies.

-She likes to go out but no get either overwhelmed and likes to stay inside doing chill things but hyper acting a lot and sleeping at the same time, and dancing this BTS steps and later sleep, and then talk a lot, and then coffee relax and then debate about global domination. There is no way :0.

-She's the bond between crazy and good.

The problems that I analyze that can ruin her are: Overwhelming burnout (Tired all the time). Social Crisis (Saviors Pressure). Mind Lost (Procrastination led to believe that goals are impossible, she is not lazy, just needs too much social positivity to build determination). Lack of Freedom (Like our fellow INTJ, we are prisoners of our ideas. ENFJ are prisoner of their social success).

There was physical violence and there was emotional violence. We didn't get married and I got pregnant. He was really happy and encouraged me to keep the pregnancy. He promised that he would be a perfect partner and a perfect father. Throughout the entire pregnancy, I was depressed and he left me alone most of the time, he would go out with friends and play video games. When the child was born, he came to the hospital and asked me to make him coffee after a C- section. I saw on his phone that there was lots of history of porn and he asked me to give him BJ while I was in the hospital and squint my eyes while doing it. After the birth, he disappeared and came back whenever he wanted. We moved in together again and the violence increased and I went back to my parents. I managed to become a dependent, bought a car and rented an apartment and moved in with my son. Days passed and he came back again and manipulated me and we got back together. He kept pressuring me to move  together with him again and made every effort to find us an apartment. But I wasn't okay with it. In the end, he put lots of pressure on me to do it and I signed a contract with him. We've only been in the apartment for a month and a half, but I feel really bad, constant pressure, sadness and depression. I can't even touch him or be next to him. He doesn't accept that I want to break up.

Last night, running on exam stress, nine cups of coffee, and no sleep, I made the dumbest decision ever.
There's this construction site in the school grounds (they're expanding the place), and my friend joked about this massive log lying around. He said it's probably from one of those old pine trees they cut down and went, ""Wouldn't it be hilarious if you carried it to the dorm?"" And, of course, my over-caffeinated brain went, ""Sure, why not.""
So, I actually did it. Dragged this 35kg piece of wood (not super tall, just up to my knees, but still ridiculously heavy) from the bottom of the school grounds all the way to the top floor of the dorm.
Alone. And for what? It took me a few minutes after catching my breath to ask myself, ""What the actual hell am I doing?""
Now the log is just sitting in my dorm, and here's the kicker-I'll be leaving for home soon after finals, so l can't even take it with me. I have no idea what to do with it. Maybe I'll leave it here as a parting gift to the school or something.

1gx7xk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gx7xk0/new_job_objectively_better_but_miss_my_old_job/,"New job objectively better, but miss my old job.","Hi everyone, as the title suggests, i recently started a new position and have been in it for just over 6 months. However I can't stop thinking about factors about my old position that I miss.

A little background below, gonna keep specifics out.

 My old position - Process Engineer for a relatively well know defense contractor. Worked there after i graduated college, worked there for about 4 years until I decided to leave for my new company.

  
New position - Larger company where I design custom heavy equipment (as well as general engineering for our standard products, but mostly custom stuff is what I do).

  
So anyways, when I graduated college my dream career path was always to work for a defense contractor, I always had an attraction to the aerospace engineering world and it seemed like when I was accepted to join the process engineering team I would be there for the rest of my career. I'll go over my years there for a better background. My first year (2020) I got a sizeable raise for being as green as I was but coming in during 2020 I was really thrust into much more responsibility than I should have been with my experience, but I was able to succeed relatively well at a young age when most of my coworkers were 20-30 years older than me with much more experience (I was 22 at the time). Ok so first year went great I thought, and i really thought that I was fitting in with the engineering teams on my projects and establishing myself in the company. Year 2, took a turn in a strange direction, my boss at the time was fired unexpectedly, myself the the other process engineers were called into a meeting with our VP of ops and told that we will now be reporting directly to him. Ok whatever no big deal, fast forward throughout that year, it was the first year I headed a project of my own (continuity tester that we used for these giant cable harnesses, really smoothed out production), anyways I get to my second year review really proud of what I had accomplished and really expecting either a raise or a promotion, as alot of my coworkers felt i deserved. I ended up getting a 3% raise. Ok i figured i cant get a huge raise every year, i left that review a little disappointed but didn't let it get to me because i still really enjoyed the work, and the salary was still pretty decent for my workload. Year 3, my coworker another process engineer who graduated college the same time as me just came a few months after me puts in her 2 weeks notice. I was upset because we were really the only 2 in the engineering side that was on the younger side, so we became pretty friendly. She left due to the salary not being up to par with the workload, and honestly i didnt blame her, i felt the same at this point. After she left, most of her projects were dumped on me, i had to be responsible for these projects as well as mine. This year was the busiest one of them all, I often would be working 60-70 hour weeks (unpaid OT mind you), it was pretty common i would leave, go home, gym, dinner, and then open my laptop and work until i was too tired to do anything else, then id get up and do it again. About halfway through this year is when i met my current partner, when we were getting to know eachother we obviously were talking about careers. She is a nurse and I work for a defense contractor (Lots of jokes about opposites attract I know, ive heard em all haha). As we dated first few months she really started to notice how stressed i was all the time, I would kinda vent to her alot about it, she asked me why i am there still if im doing so much work for the pay of one engineer. Thats where it clicked for me. I decided i was gonna stick around for my 3 year review to see how it goes. Year 3 review, 4% raise! this one I didnt react well too, i made it pretty obvious that i thought it was unacceptable given everything i had done for this company over the last year. I expressed in that meeting that i would like to take less responsibility on these projects if im only being paid about the same as i was after 1 year. Yes i know i wasn't expecting a 2x salary increase but i was expecting something similar to what i was seeing some other engineers getting during their review. It was at this time i started looking and interviewing at new companies. I started looking at other defense contractors, interviewed at a few, got an offer from one which I ended up declining since i really didnt want a repeat of the last 3 and some odd months years ( i knew some people who worked there that i met through some mutual projects between our companies), so I started looking for other jobs, I interview at 4 places, all heavy equipment/big name companies. It happens that a good friend of mine who worked for one of these companies was an engineer at where i am now, and he gave me a reference, i interviewed, loved it, my now boss asked me what i wanted for a salary, i told him what i wanted. And i got the salary i wanted! which i was so happy about. Now thats where i am, i enjoy this company alot.



Ok, so that was a rant, why do I miss my old company? #1 As much of a shitshow that place was I almost kind of enjoyed the ""high octane"" pace of things there, from the time i got there until the time i left i was almost always dealing with an issue that needed a solution quick, which I enjoyed. #2 The people I worked with directly were incredible, I honestly don't think that i will ever work with a better team of engineers, my senior engineers were incredibly supportive of me throughout my entire time there and even supported me when i decided to leave. In fact all of them were happy i was leaving, because alot of them were upset with the upper management that i wasnt being paid/recognized as i should be, and that i would leave the same as my coworker the year before me. One of the senior engineers i worked with really closely over the years took me to the side during my last week to tell me, ""Hey, I love working with you and want to keep working with you, but I am glad you're leaving because this company doesnt develop early careers well"" He also made the joke during my last project meeting that ""I'm always welcome back, but to call me first so I can talk you out of it."". I still keep up with alot of the people i worked with, as I didnt have to relocate at all for my new position, im only about 20 mins away from my old companies HQ. I still regularly talk/ get drinks with some of my former coworkers.

  
Now I am in this strange position i feel, I love my new job, I am paid fairly, have a very manageable workload, and everyone is incredibly friendly and supportive as I am still learning this new industry. I am much happier, with a much healthier work/life balance, the only time i have ever opened up my laptop outside of work is on a weekend when i have nothing to do when my partner is working. So I work a little OT (Which im paid a decently high hourly wage for!!) My partner says i seem happier and less stressed, i really am. But some part of me for some reason misses the chaos and super stressful role I used to be in. Maybe its the Stockholm syndrome speaking, maybe its just because it was my first step in my career and I got used to it? 

  
Anyways, I know the right choice is to stay with my current company, which i plan to do for the foreseeable future, but was wondering if anyone else has ever had an experience like this before?

  
TLDR:

Old company cons: shitshow everyday, not paid enough, no work/life balance.

Old company pros: Great people, really good coffee machine, kinda liked the chaos.

New company pros: Higher salary, work with one of my best friends outside of work, good workload (enough to stay busy and not get bored), tons of free swag, huge cubicle, actually have a life outside work.

New company cons: Coffee is mediocre, not really alot of good places to go out for lunch around the office. 

For some reason i miss my old company tho haha.",1,1732282383.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

Added a TLDR,"Need Advice. I am F25, and I met a friend, M34, this September. We initially met playing Pickleball and played with some friends from a tennis group or just his different friends for about a month and a half until it got cold outside. I suggested we start playing indoor soccer now—just us two- and he suggested indoor skating with me. Before this, I sent a reel regarding cat yoga, and he suggested hot yoga and pilates.

The night before, at around 2am, he messaged me to cancel in a series of replies and never rescheduled another time to go. Furthermore, on social media, he would like my Instagram stories of pictures of myself or memes I post, but never anything I post on my feed—just an observation. He would remember details about me such as my favourite foods, city, pickleball court, restaurants, and cafes and send me pics or freq. make references to the following things just listed. Once or twice, he has asked me to go to a cafe with him, but we’ve never gone. He preferred only to want to go during the day. Our mutual friend is included in our group chat and has made us go to dinners all three together. He is introverted and likes things a particular way. We would discuss things like relationship shows or relationships in general. 

A few weeks ago, I sent reels of cafes we could go to, and he said, “Thanks, it’s near my work; I’m gonna take my boss.” then, I sent pics of the cafe and loved it. I think my hints of interest for him don’t actually reach him well. This week, while I was talking to him, I kept receiving what I consider mixed signals from him. One minute, he is super talkative in the messages (in person, he is fine), and then hours go by, and he doesn’t respond. So I talked to our mutual friend to ask him directly if he liked me. he replied to the mutual guy friend that nothing I am cool, and he sees me only as a friend, and that nothing is going on between us… therefore, one would assume to give up, right? However, I think he and his friend could possibly be in contact with me and that the friend is also talking to me about him. Triangulation vibes… so he simply wrote that but didn’t mean it. I say this because he would be flirty with me and continue to play activities with me that I am no good at (he could enjoy my company rather than focusing on playing seriously). He introduced me to his cousins and family friends the first time we went skating together, invited me to coffee with them afterward, and paid for my order. That day, he told me his cousins were getting married and spoke freely about the topic of marriage and his previous relationships. 

The week after, we played soccer, just us two, and usually, it’s free, but we went on a Saturday morning, and he offered to hold my bag and paid for the admission to play. It was a very sweet gesture. In-person, he has told me he has fearful avoidant attachment but has worked on it. In previous text messages, he mentioned that the last girl he dated, he never verbally told her he liked her but showed through his actions, and when she told him she didn’t feel an emotional connection with him, she left a week later after dating for 3 months. 

Thus, despite working on his attachment style, I believe he wouldn’t necessarily tell me his feelings, either. I am an anxious/ secure attachment, but because I like him so much, I am very anxious and confused about whether he likes me or not. I have become kind of protective of myself and anxious now, wanting to see him and talk to him more often than we do. 

Now, I am wondering if it seems like he likes me romantically. If so, how do I go about either being more flirty with him or directly asking him if he likes me?


TLDR: I (F25) met a friend (M34) in September through pickleball. We’ve done various activities together, and he remembers details about me, has introduced me to his family, and paid for outings. He gives mixed signals—sometimes flirty and attentive, other times distant. He told a mutual friend he sees me as just a friend, but I think he might be unsure due to his fearful-avoidant attachment style. I’m anxious because I like him and feel confused. Should I be more flirty, or directly ask if he likes me romantically?

I then tried the Churchill Connecticut and I believe the habano offering they had. Which further reinforced my claim. It's not that any of them are bad cigars. I gave all 3 like a high 80 low 90 rating. It's just that I can find better cigars or cigars that are almost the same for a fraction of the price. The best example of this is in their lower priced line. Most of the AVO line is arguably better or just as good as the more expensive Davidoff labeled line.


The Late Hour has changed that opinion for me I do not think you can get a similar cigars for a lower price. I can find better ones (for me) like the Liga Privada no.9 but they're not really comparable. This maduro offered a unique take on maduros that I don't think I've had before, especially done this well. The notes were creamy, nuttiness, chocolate, coffee, and at times hints of caramel and dried fruit. Seems like simple notes you can find in a lot of cigars when written down, but in practice it's very unique. It's complex, well balanced and like all davidoff owned brand cigars I've had (including AVO and Camacho) it's perfectly constructed. 


Davidoff has won me over with this one. Thanks for whoever reccomended me this here too. 


I gave it a 96 overall score. It lost a few points because of random pepper blasts. I don't know if I'm going to ever pick up this cigar again, I'd probably pick up the Liga instead, but I'm happy I got to try it once. The reccomendations I've got on here have been top notch thanks everyone. ",2,1732282179.0,cigar_refuge,1,1.0,False

i made an impulsive decision on the bus but i ended up embarrassing myself and i haven’t been able to get over it since.

ok so i (19f) am a college student and i take the bus to classes in the morning. one day I was running late so I took the first seat I saw. the person next to me had to get off so I had to get up, but i ended up dropping my thermos, sunglasses, and flash cards. my thermos rolled directly to this guy on the bus and he handed it back to me. the next day i wanted to thank him so I wrote “thank you for saving my coffee yesterday! :) “ on a piece of paper and handed it to him (we both had headphones on) and he opened it and handed it back to me. ever since then I’ve felt so guilty and now him and the entire bus probably think I’m weird and creepy.

My birthday was last month, and where I work we have a big, fun birthday meal provided to celebrate everyone’s birthdays. It is usually lunch, which gives us all options for meals we can eat with whatever dietary restrictions we may have. 

Last month, the person running the organization of the meal spoke to me both in person and via the group text created to get everyone’s ideas (collaboration is a good thing!). She asked me specifically as many people on our small staff know I eat a low-carb, no-sugar diet for health reasons. I told her that I have to eat low-carb and as long as I can access a meat (any kind, not picky) and a veg or salad, I’m good to go.  Everyone else on the birthday chat saw my response as well. 

When the birthday meal was held, it was a breakfast from a local fried chicken restaurant. Of all the options provided, there was nothing I could eat. The coffee was packaged and sweetened; the fried chicken was on biscuits; and all the other options were sugar-based options. I just went back with no plate and was grateful I had eaten something at home. 

Later, a person expressed regret that I didn’t get anything to eat to celebrate my birthday. I told her what the adult side of my brain had been telling myself all day — that it’s unrealistic for 15 people to change what they want for the needs of one person. She looked sad and said they normally do. I didn’t want to throw the organizer under the bus, so I just smiled and said it was no big deal, I’d had a bite at home anyway and had brought a good lunch. But the little brat who lives inside of me felt bad all day. I’m not doing this to be skinny — I’m doing it because I don’t want to lose toes or my eyesight or be on multiple injections every day (if you know, you know).  Am I overreacting? Is it realistic to have thought that the people on staff, who I think of as friends, should have made sure I had an option to enjoy? Or am I, indeed, just being a brat?

1gx7p6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1gx7p6e/selfpublishing_an_illustrated_biography_the_saga/,Self-publishing an illustrated biography - the saga,"I have written a biography of a reasonably famous photographer. It has been professionally edited and I've even managed to get the nonfiction editors of the couple of major publishers to read it. Everyone says it's well-written and they think it is a worthy subject but they can't figure out how to make money from it. 

No problem, I have already borne all of the costs and I have moved forward with design of the book and a really snappy cover. I got a little nibble from a small publisher recently but they want me to resubmit the book on the new platform which may or may not be up by January. Meanwhile I'm not getting any younger and neither is the subject of the book and we would both like to see it out before we go to the wrong side of the grass. 

I have found a printer who can turn out the book on high-quality paper with a 60 images for between $13 and $15 per book. This would be smyth sewn with an embossed fabric cover etc. The sort of beautiful book you would expect to buy in a gallery store although it is not a big coffee table format.

So far so good. I am willing to pay promotional costs and have a friend in the public relations business who would lineup interviews etc. pro bono. But when I turn to the book consultants, all they want to do is funnel me into the huge Amazon/Ingram print on demand maw. These outfits are obsessed with volume at only a two dollar-per-copy return to the author which would mean selling thousands of inferior perfect bound books with 300 dpi images. (There is nothing wrong with print on demand and perfect binding for many books but this is not one of them.)

So my question is: Does anyone know a promotion/distribution outfit that would fit my needs. Or do I need to go totally alone on this, design my own website and sell out of my basement using an Amazon reseller account?

1gx7p3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1gx7p3w/from_blank_page_to_masterpiece_navigating_the/,**“From Blank Page to Masterpiece: Navigating the Beautiful Chaos of Songwriting”**,"**The Beautiful Chaos of Songwriting**  

Alright, let’s talk about songwriting—the mysterious, maddening, magical little art that grabs us by the soul and shakes us in the best way possible. Whether you’re drowning in inspiration or staring at your guitar like it just insulted your outfit, songwriting has a way of keeping you humble. But that’s kind of the beauty of it, isn’t it?  

Think about it: every song—every single one—you’ve ever loved started the same way. A blank page. A lonely chord. A ""what if."" And somehow, from that empty space, a whole world was born. You want to create that same magic, don’t you? (Spoiler: you absolutely can.) Here are a few thoughts to kickstart your next song and remind you why you love this beautiful chaos in the first place.  

### **1. Start Messy, Stay Messy (for a While)**
Some folks wait to start writing until they feel 100% ready, as if the heavens will part and gift them with the perfect hook. Spoiler alert—it almost never works that way. Most great ideas show up when you're knee-deep in nonsense, scribbling random words or humming gibberish like you're summoning some musical spirit.  

Here’s a tip:  
- **Don’t self-edit too early.** Seriously, let it be messy and weird. Write the wrong lyrics. Play an awkward chord. It's fine! The “bad ideas” are usually the stepping stones to the real gold.  

### **2. Feel It, But Keep It Simple**  
You don’t need ten metaphors per verse or a million-dollar producer to make a song hit deep. Sometimes, it’s the raw things that stick the hardest—a single line, a repeated melody, the kind of stuff you hum when you’re in line for coffee a week later.  

Ask yourself:  
- What do I *really* want to say?  
- Is there a simpler way to say it?  

Strip it down. Get straight to the core of the emotion. You can sprinkle in the fancy stuff later if you want.  

### **3. Write for Yourself First**  
If you’re thinking, *“Will people like this?”* mid-writing, stop. Redirect that question real quick: *Do I like this?* Because truthfully, some of the best songs come from moments where writers didn’t care about how it would be received—they just wanted to connect with their own emotions. Focus on being real. The world will vibe with it more than you might think.  

### **4. Steal Like an Artist**  
Okay, not *literally*—no lawsuits, please—but let’s be honest here: every songwriter is influenced by something or someone. That’s part of the game. Dive into other songs, books, or random conversations and pull bits of inspiration to make something that’s *yours.*  

- Love Adele’s storytelling? Map out her lyrical pacing.  
- Obsessing over Olivia Rodrigo’s melodies? Experiment with those open, soaring vocal phrases.  
- Hear a great phrase in a TV show? Bam, free material.  

Just mix it up—don’t recreate, reinterpret!  

### **5. Get Comfortable Being Stuck**  
Every songwriter hits walls. You might sit with the same half-finished verse for weeks, pulling your hair out while your guitar collects dust next to you. (Pro-tip: yelling at the piano doesn’t help.) But here’s something interesting—the “stuck” moments often precede breakthroughs.  

When in doubt:  
- Put it down for a day, but don’t quit on it.  
- Try writing a “trash version” of the song. (Sometimes, it turns out not to be trash after all!)  

It’s progress, even when it feels like you're going in circles.  

---

At the end of the day, songwriting isn’t about perfection. It’s about connection—the kind you make with yourself and, eventually, with others when you share your work.  

So stop waiting for lightning to strike and just dive in. Let it be raw, weird, and imperfect. Let it make you laugh, cry, or roll your eyes. Every note, every lyric, every not-quite-right phrase you write still matters. It’s all part of the process.

Several told me that restaurant got my order and will be making it close to that 1hr mark. This is also not true because I called the restaurant and they said my order has been sitting in a bag waiting for pick up for 45mins. They had to remake it because it got cold.

I went out one night with some friends and coworkers to celebrate a friend’s birthday and was introduced to a friend of someone in group. Immediately I was attracted. He’s an older man and looks great for his age. He’s in his late forties and in great shape, he honestly looks like he could be in his early to mid thirties. He’s in great shape and we made conversation about different workouts and supplements. I learned that he’s a veteran, well traveled, divorced (to a woman), and has a kid in college. We bonded over music, history, old movies, food, and discussed politics. We got along well as he’s young at heart and I’m an old soul. 

After everyone left we hung around the bar a little longer much to the chagrin of the bartender and got to talking some more. He mentioned that he lives kind of far away and is pondering getting a room for the night. I immediately understood what this meant. I walked him to the hotel and he got a room and he invited me up. We spent the night together and it was an amazing release for the both of us. Talking to him some more over coffee in the morning at a nearby coffee shop he said that he’s mostly retired and lives out on a farm on land his family has owned for many many years. He lives mostly by himself except for when family are visiting and he has his kid over. He invited me to come see him sometime and we exchanged contact info. He said he really does like me and wants to see me again. 

I wasn’t really expecting to hear from him again after but he texts me asking how I am and actually making conversation with me. It was a nice change from the usual drudgery of forced conversations and eventual disposal I’m used to. We make plans for when I’m off on a weekend and I made my way out to his farm. He gave me the grand tour and we had dinner, drinks, and sat around a fire. He played guitar and I played what I know how to play. We bonded some more and get physically intimate by the fire. It was so romantic (as corny as that sounds). We went inside and got intimate a few more times. We talked about our lives and plans for the future and he said he really does like me and can see something in the future with me. I told him I feel the same way. 

We made more plans before I left and he kissed me before I left, gave me a long embrace and looked sad when I pulled out of the driveway. We agreed to meet at a national park to go hiking and we hung out in the town nearby just shopping and hanging out like any other couple. We went back to his house after and worked out in his garage. We showered together and he made dinner. I eventually had to go and he said “I love you”. Without thinking I responded saying the same. It felt sooo good to be wanted and appreciated like that. I know he felt the same way. We kissed and said our goodbyes. Next weekend we’re going to hang out again. I always have a great time with him.

I hope I’m not moving too fast but he does seem to be into it as much as I am. What are your thoughts? Is this puppy love or can this be something bigger and more serious?

1gx7l8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gx7l8w/struggling_with_partners_financial_criticism_and/,Struggling with Partner's Financial Criticism and Unequal Contributions,"A good short title asking for advice/ I’m seeking financial advice. My partner and I agreed that I would take all maternity and parental leave (a total of 18 months in Quebec, 15 of which were paid) to care for our newborn child. Nine months after he was born, I started a master's program in counseling psychology. He agreed to co-sign a student line of credit with me. He never took any time off from his job, while I took all the time to care for our child. My son started daycare at 12 months, but due to feeding difficulties and other adaptation issues, the daycare frequently asked me to pick him up. After four months, I took him out and he was subsequently rejected from two other places (mainly due to not eating his meals and other behavioral issues related to separation anxiety). We decided he’d stay home with me for now until he was more mature.

Eventually, I had to be laid off because my job couldn’t keep me on leave after the 18 months, so I lost that income. I’m now at the end of my master's program and will begin my practicum in early 2025. Here are the issues I’m facing with my partner: he frequently brings up money and makes me feel guilty for using the line of credit (which I currently owe $43k on). He doesn’t appreciate that I stayed home with our son and downplays the fact that our son wasn’t ready for daycare. He also says that losing my low-income job (which paid around $55k a year) wasn’t a big deal.

He currently pays for my program, and we agreed that he’d cover the costs and I would repay him once I finish school. Since he helps pay for my education, he barely contributes financially to anything else and criticizes me whenever I spend money—whether it’s on food, clothing, toys, or even just a coffee. I’ve reached a point where he humiliates me, associating this with a lack of character and personality flaws. For example, he now says I’m financially irresponsible, that I’m a ""princess,"" and that I’m inconsequential. Meanwhile, I’ve spent half of my savings in my TFSA (about $20k) since our son was born.

As I mentioned, he pays for the school (money I’m supposed to repay), but here’s the issue: he barely contributes to anything else financially. He only covers half of the costs for wipes, diapers, clothing, and formula, which our son still needs due to some sensory processing issues and resistance to eating nutritious meals consistently. He doesn’t contribute to anything else in the house. He has his own apartment and comes to mine every day after work but sleeps at his apartment during weekdays because it’s closer to his office. He no longer contributes to food or anything else in the house, aside from the limited items I mentioned earlier.

I feel like I’ve made all the sacrifices to raise our son properly while still pursuing a master's degree to improve my career, even losing my job to protect our son. He doesn’t seem to recognize any of this and acts as though I’m taking money from him. Lately, he’s been offending and humiliating me a lot about it, and it’s affecting my mental health. I feel depressed when I think about the awful things he tells me daily (for instance, he says I’m financially taking advantage of him, that I’m an opportunist, among many other things). He can’t see reality for what it is and doesn’t recognize the sacrifices I’ve made. He maintains that he has to keep his job because he earns significantly more, but his savings are his alone, and his income is for himself, so it’s not like that benefits me in the long run.",0,1732281358.0,personalfinance,6,0.5,False

Imagine a home that’s more than just a place to live—a sanctuary that caters to your every need, reflects your personality, and stands as a masterpiece of modern design. For those looking to elevate their living standards, **new construction luxury homes** offer the ultimate blend of comfort, innovation, and sophistication.

Gone are the days when luxury merely meant ornate décor and sprawling spaces. Today’s high-end properties focus on functionality, eco-friendliness, and personalization, making them the epitome of contemporary living. In this blog, we’ll explore the endless possibilities of owning a luxury home, delving into the reasons they’re more than just a status symbol—they’re an investment in a fulfilling lifestyle.

From their advanced features to their bespoke designs, new construction homes have set the standard for luxury. Let’s uncover what makes these properties so special.

# What Defines a Luxury Home?

What sets a luxury home apart from other properties? It’s more than just a hefty price tag. Luxury homes embody superior quality, cutting-edge technology, and meticulous attention to detail.

One of the standout features is exclusivity. Whether it’s a custom-built mansion on a private estate or a sleek penthouse overlooking the skyline, luxury homes are designed to provide an unparalleled sense of privacy and refinement. High-end materials, from Italian marble to rare hardwoods, elevate the aesthetic appeal and durability of these homes.

Moreover, the incorporation of smart home systems and sustainable practices showcases how innovation meets opulence in today’s luxury market.

# Why Choose New Construction Homes Over Resales?

The decision between buying a new construction luxury home and a resale property often boils down to one’s lifestyle aspirations. With new construction, you have the unique opportunity to tailor your home to your exact preferences. Imagine picking every detail, from the flooring to the fixtures, ensuring that your home is as unique as you are.

Additionally, these homes are designed with cutting-edge technology, which translates to energy efficiency and reduced utility costs. No more dealing with outdated systems or costly repairs. Instead, enjoy state-of-the-art HVAC systems, top-tier insulation, and energy-efficient appliances that keep your home running smoothly.

Lastly, the maintenance requirements for new construction are minimal, allowing homeowners to spend more time enjoying their luxurious surroundings rather than worrying about repairs.

# The Unmatched Appeal of New Construction Luxury Homes

When it comes to luxury living, nothing rivals the elegance and functionality of **new construction luxury homes**. These residences offer cutting-edge designs, blending timeless aesthetics with the latest technological advancements. From expansive open floor plans to seamlessly integrated smart home systems, every detail is crafted to perfection.

One key feature is the superior craftsmanship and high-quality materials used in construction. From bespoke cabinetry to intricate woodwork, the attention to detail ensures a lasting impression. Plus, customization options mean your home will reflect your vision and cater to your specific needs.

Imagine having a home office with automated lighting and temperature control or a kitchen equipped with state-of-the-art appliances that would make any chef envious. These features aren’t just luxuries—they’re enhancements to your everyday life.

# Innovative Features in New Construction Luxury Homes

Modern luxury homes redefine opulence with features designed to simplify and enhance life. Here’s a closer look at what’s trending:

* **Smart Home Systems:** Control lighting, temperature, and security with the touch of a button or a voice command.
* **Spa-Like Bathrooms:** Think rainfall showers, heated floors, and soaking tubs that create a wellness retreat in your home.
* **Outdoor Living Spaces:** With features like infinity pools, fire pits, and outdoor kitchens, these homes are perfect for entertaining.

Every element is tailored to create a seamless blend of beauty and practicality.

# Sustainability and Eco-Friendliness in Modern Luxury Homes

Today’s luxury isn’t just about indulgence; it’s about responsibility. Eco-conscious buyers will appreciate the sustainable elements incorporated into new construction luxury homes. Green building materials such as bamboo flooring and reclaimed wood ensure durability while reducing environmental impact.

Energy-efficient systems, including solar panels, triple-glazed windows, and smart thermostats, not only minimize carbon footprints but also result in significant savings. Imagine living in a home that not only supports your lifestyle but also supports the planet.

# The Personalization Advantage

One of the most exciting aspects of building a new construction luxury home is the chance to make it your own. Personalization goes beyond just paint colors or furniture; it’s about creating a space that reflects your lifestyle.

Whether it’s a gourmet kitchen designed for hosting dinner parties, a private gym tailored to your fitness goals, or a home theater with immersive sound technology, the possibilities are endless. Collaboration with designers and architects ensures every corner of your home tells your story.

# Location, Location, Location!

When investing in a luxury home, the location is just as important as the home itself. New construction luxury homes often prioritize prime areas that offer a blend of convenience, beauty, and exclusivity. Whether nestled in a serene suburb, perched on a hill with panoramic views, or situated close to vibrant urban centers, the location enhances both the lifestyle and the value of the property.

Proximity to high-end amenities, such as fine dining, upscale shopping, and cultural attractions, adds another layer of luxury. At the same time, access to green spaces and recreational facilities ensures a perfect balance between urban sophistication and nature’s tranquility.

Moreover, luxury developments are typically built in secure, well-planned neighborhoods, providing peace of mind alongside aesthetic charm. When selecting a location, think about not just your current needs but also long-term growth, ensuring that your investment continues to appreciate.

# Maximizing Value in Your Investment

New construction luxury homes are not just places to live; they’re also smart financial investments. A well-designed property in a sought-after location tends to appreciate over time, making it a valuable asset for future generations.

Modern features such as energy-efficient systems, sustainable materials, and smart home technology contribute to long-term savings. For instance, homes equipped with solar panels and efficient HVAC systems significantly reduce utility costs, offering both economic and environmental benefits.

Additionally, the demand for luxury homes continues to grow, ensuring that these properties maintain their appeal in the market. Whether you plan to live in your home for decades or eventually sell it, the quality and innovation of a new construction luxury home promise a strong return on investment.

# The Emotional Reward of Living in a Luxury Home

Imagine waking up in a sunlit master suite, sipping coffee on a balcony with breathtaking views, or hosting friends in a stunning open-concept living area. The emotional benefits of living in a luxury home go far beyond its tangible features.

Every room in a luxury home is designed to elevate your daily experiences. From serene spa-like bathrooms that offer a retreat after a long day to gourmet kitchens that inspire culinary creativity, these spaces make everyday moments feel extraordinary.

Living in a luxury home also means creating memories in a space that feels uniquely yours. It’s about having the freedom to entertain, relax, and grow in an environment that’s as exceptional as the life you envision.

# The Process of Purchasing a New Construction Luxury Home

Purchasing a luxury home is a significant milestone, and the process can feel overwhelming without proper guidance. Here’s a roadmap to simplify the journey:

1. **Research and Planning:** Begin by defining your budget, preferences, and must-have features. Research neighborhoods and builders to align your vision with their expertise.
2. **Choosing the Right Builder:** Partnering with a reputable builder is crucial. Look for those with a strong portfolio of luxury projects and a commitment to quality.
3. **Customization Options:** Discuss your ideas with architects and designers, ensuring every detail aligns with your lifestyle and aesthetic.
4. **Navigating Contracts:** Review agreements carefully, paying attention to timelines, warranties, and additional costs.
5. **Regular Communication:** Stay in touch with your builder during the construction process to ensure your vision is brought to life.

By approaching the process strategically, you’ll find that building your dream home can be both exciting and rewarding.

# Overcoming Common Misconceptions

Luxury homes, especially new constructions, often come with misconceptions. Let’s address a few:

* **Myth:** “Luxury homes are overpriced.” **Reality:** While they require a larger initial investment, their quality, efficiency, and resale value justify the cost.
* **Myth:** “Building takes too long.” **Reality:** With skilled builders and clear timelines, construction can be efficient and predictable.

I feel normal but lazy I sleep easily and hard to get up from bed .. I sleep twice a day . Usually its hard for me to leave home ! I like to spend days at home .. i feel there is something wrong in my system I need to be more productive and refreshing . My next appointment will be in 2 months after completing 6 months on 450 but I feel that I dont want to wait more! Am confused as these medication should give me more energy but maybe because I am jobless now and I don’t see that its meaningful if i go out during the day and do something.

1gx7ekn,https://www.reddit.com/r/tfmr_support/comments/1gx7ekn/33_week_de_outpatient_process/,33 week D&E Outpatient Process,"I just went through TFMR this week and writing everything out has been very therapeutic as well as reading everyone’s stories on this subreddit. I figured my story could help someone else to understand exactly what the protocol is so I am going to be very honest and detailed about everything I personally experienced.

First, my baby was diagnosed with heart abnormalities at 20 weeks and we were closely monitoring and then at 31 and 3, the growth scan showed severe brain abnormalities. My MFM referred us to John’s Hopkins for care at a specialty facility and to have a fetal MRI done. John’s Hopkins got us in very quickly - only 4 days later when I was 32 weeks.

We spent two days at John’s Hopkins getting tests and speaking with specialists and came to the decision of TFMR with their help. We were not able to go through their Labor and Delivery department and they referred us to Partners in Abortion Care for outpatient termination. We were scheduled for the next week so we had a full week of waiting.

While waiting, we remained out of state at a hotel because I couldn’t fathom coming home. At 32 and 5, I went into preterm labor. We returned to Johns Hopkins as the specialist we were working with, Dr. Rosner, recommended (she was amazing and gave us her personal cell phone number to call with any concerns and checked on us frequently through everything). They kept me on bedrest in the hospital with medications to stall my labor until we could make it to our appointment. They had us meet with NICU in case the baby still came early and NICU discussed our options for palliative care and avoiding painful life extending procedure and the range of our choices (luckily we made it to our appointment).

The first day was long. There was a lot of waiting and discussion. Initially I was brought back without my husband. They asked me questions about my safety and some medical questions and then asked if I wanted my husband there for the rest which I gladly agreed to having him with me as sometimes it was hard for me to speak with all my emotions. Our discussion lasted for over an hour regarding my complete medical history as well as how the process would go over the next three days and what our wishes were.

After this, they prepared a room for us to have the first step - an injection directly into the heart which stops the heartbeat. Before starting, the doctor performed a cervical check as I had just come from being in pre-term labor and confirmed that I would still be on course for the typical timeline and protocol. She then ultrasounded the baby, showed us her heart and her profile, and she left the room to let us say our goodbyes in private as we watched our little girl’s heartbeat. This was one of the hardest parts (emotionally). I couldn’t get any words out except goodbye and I love you.

When they returned, they prepped my belly, placed a drape to shield the procedure, and injected a numbing agent into my skin so I didn’t feel anything they were doing. They used the ultrasound to inject her heart which took about 2 minutes total and they talked through everything as they were doing it. They also told me when her heartbeat was slowing down so I could say any last goodbyes. After that, they gave me a medication to help my cervix soften for the start of the process. They also gave me Naproxen, Tylenol, and Zofran. They told me to take the Naproxen at 8 and 8 everyday to help with the pain and take the Tylenol and Zofran as needed for additional pain control and nausea.

The next day was a short day. I was scheduled for an appointment in the afternoon to get cervical dilators placed. They brought me back to the same room I had been in the day before. My husband was again allowed to be with me for this part. First they did a repeat ultrasound to confirm there was still no heartbeat and check baby’s position and the amount of amniotic fluid. Then they prepped my cervix and gave me a numbing injection into my cervix to help with pain from placing the dilators. The numbing injection stung but it was short and relaxing through it as much as I could helped the pain. They then placed a few dilators and gauze directly into my cervix. 

They gave me an oral antibiotic to take at the clinic that day. I also was given an induction medication to take an hour before going into the clinic the next day. I also got a script for Tramadol which they said to make sure to fill in case I need it overnight from intense cramping. I filled the tramadol but luckily did not need it as the naproxen and Tylenol were enough for me. And that night I was able to sleep. 

The final day was the hardest. They said I was able to have a small breakfast so I had an English muffin and some hot cocoa before going in. My husband and I arrived for the appointment first thing in the morning. He was not allowed with me for any of the process today. They called me back and went to a nearby coffee shop to wait. The first thing they did was another ultrasound to confirm no heartbeat, position, and fluid again. Then they did another cervical exam and removed the dilators and gauze from my cervix. After that, they gave me more numbing medication in my cervix then broke my water and placed another induction medication directly into my cervix.

I was then taken back to a room with a few recliners and other women going through the same process. They provided a heating pad for me and I brought a blanket and stuffed animal with me. They had calming music playing and a TV with fish swimming in the ocean. I had mentally prepared for childbirth with this baby and had gone through an unmedicated birth with my son 2 years prior. I asked them if I could go through the process without sedation and they agreed to help with that. The other women with me did have sedation on board so you can choose to have IV or oral sedation, but I wanted to remember everything especially about my daughter immediately after giving birth to her so I chose no sedation. They don’t offer epidurals at the practice though. 

As each contraction started I relaxed my body (each specific body part from head to toe), smelled my favorite hand lotion, and thought of the happiest feeling I ever had (my son laughing). This immensely helped my contractions but they did start to get stronger and gave no breaks in between. At that point they gave me a large blow up cushion to sit on and a peanut ball to lean on during contractions. I then felt a lot of pressure around my butt and got very hot so they walked me back to the same room I had been in for every other procedure. 

I couldn’t make it to the chair to give birth. I got on my elbows and knees on the ground and told them I had to start pushing. They trusted me and said if you have to push then push. They put blankets under my knees so I wasn’t on the hard surface. My baby was breech so I saw her legs coming first. This helped motivate me to continue pushing but it got very difficult around her head. It took a few minutes and I took lots of breaks but eventually I got her head out. 

They cut her cord and let me hold her as I wanted to immediately. So I sat in the chair with her. It felt so peaceful and like it was meant to be during that moment. As I held her and took in everything about her, they removed my placenta for me and then suctioned anything that could’ve been left inside. I was so happy to hold her. At first it was shocking as she was covered in white vernix and very very pale white/grey with very fragile skin and some rips in her skin. But it was nice to experience seeing her and holding her.

They then took her to clean her up and monitored my recovery for 2 hours. We were then taken to a room for her viewing. I had brought a swaddle and bow for them to dress her and I had a matching robe. Although I’m glad to have pictures with her in her swaddle and me in my matching robe, it was much much harder to see her cold in the viewing so we kept it very short with only a couple quick photos. 

Afterwards, they provide a medication to stop your milk from coming in but they still recommend wearing sports bras 24/7 for the next few days. They also gave us her foot prints and an ultrasound image they took the first day. We brought paint and shrinky dink paper and they made a bunch of hand and footprints for us to make keychains with (only a couple are perfect but my husband and I only need one each). They provided information for a funeral home and we contacted them for arrangements for ashes to be sent to us. After all of this they also gave us discharge information and a goodie bag (which I declined as I had already purchased all of the postpartum essentials I needed). 

Overall, I wish I had been able to deliver through L&D but having to go through outpatient this was probably the best it could have gone. I miss my baby girl so much and feel so empty without her. I hope this detailed post helps other mother’s to be able to mentally prepare for this.",3,1732280809.0,tfmr_support,0,1.0,False
1gx7eho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horikitafanclub/comments/1gx7eho/spoilers_125/,Spoilers 12.5,"* Arisu's Expulsion

Arisu's voluntary withdrawal from school has been finalized, and she is leaving. Her transfer destination is the same school as that of Masumi Kamuro.

In her final conversation with Ryuuen, Arisu confessed what Ayanoköji had told her. While Ryuuen didn't fully agree, he pointed out that Arisu's decision to voluntarily withdraw was also a sign of weakness. At the end, she said, ""Until we meet again,"" but he wondered how they could ever meet again.

In her conversation with Ayanokoji, he explained that Arisu's overwhelming strength had meant that other leaders still had room to grow, while Arisu had reached her limit. That was why he had decided on her withdrawal. At the end, he made two requests. The first was a question: ""My role isn't over, is it?"" implying a promise to meet again somewhere after leaving the school. This seems to hint at a college arc, and there's a lot of potential for future developments.

The second request was for Ayanoköji to look after the class after she left and to decide what to do with Hashimoto. Finally, the two of them embraced.


*Karuizawa's Breakup

After a trip to the movies and karaoke, Karuizawa realizes that the breakup is inevitable. Ayanokouji declares ""Let's break up"", calling her ""Karuizawa"" instead of ""Kei"".
Although it is painful, she accepts the decision, but is emotionally shaken, isolating herself at home for a while.



*The Night with Ichinose

A year later, a shaken Ichinose avoids leaving the house. Ayanokouji visits her room, and after a conversation, she kisses him and leads him to bed. They spend the night together. Afterward, Ichinose returns to class with new determination, forming a dark deal with Ayanokouji to use his skills as a leader while she maintains her position.


*The budding of Horikita's love

Horikita and Ayanokoji were drinking coffee together. Horikita heard that he had broken up with Karuizawa, and she listened to that story too.
Ayanokoji then asked if she would like to put herself forward as a potential boyfriend. Horikita brushed him off. However, after they were alone, she felt her heart pounding.
This portrayal made it seem like she had already fallen in love with Ayanokoji.",9,1732280803.0,Horikitafanclub,14,1.0,False

It has been a long day at work, still having to use the improvised home office, and even though it is already late in the evening, you are still sitting at your desk, paperwork stacked all over the way too small table. The last months have been increasingly difficult, and the expected relief by conveniently working from home turned into a stressful chaotic lifestyle where the borders between working and living became blurry lines. These days the passing of time is only noticed by how the sunlight slowly fades out against the white wall behind the screen, and the moment you have to turn on the desk lamp, having learnt to appreciate the  comfort of its warmth radiating light against your skin, as well as the occasional walk to get yet another coffee. Your neck is sore from staring at the screen all day, and the way the chair hugs your voluptuous thighs starts to feel very uncomfortable.

You're so burned out and distracted that you barely notice the front door being opened. You recognize it is me coming home by the sound of my steps and the unique way my keychain rattles as I hang it up next to the door, but you fail to engage with that information in any way.

""Another long day, huh?""

You didn't notice me walking up the stairs and leaning against the door.

""Yes babe. I just...I just have to get this done really quickly and then I'll be ready for you"", you reply without seeking any eye contact.

I slowly approach you as the wooden boards calmly surrender to my soft steps with a crackling sound.
""Let me help you relax"", I say in a calming but distinctive voice. You smell my after shave, feeling the warm presence of my head behind yours, my warm and moist breath just gently gracing your hair and your ear. I lean forward and with my right arm reach over the desk, turning off the screen. For a moment you look at me out of shocked confusion, yet when our eyes finally make contact, you see that my intentions are good. I lean back and your gaze follows me as you turn your head around. My strong arms grab the chair by its sides and roll it away from the desk, turning you towards me. I kneel down in front of you, keeping eye contact the entire time, and my hands reach for your inner thighs. You can feel an instant throbbing from in between your legs as I grace you there when I begin to spread them open in an outward motion as my hands move over your skin towards your knees.
Slowly my head moves towards your throbbing cunt, its heat radiating into your body alongside the pulsating sensation. I press my face and mouth against your leggings-covered center, enjoying the warm and moist smell of a pussy that is already getting wet. Still keeping that eye contact I firmly cup the upper part of your cunt with my mouth, knibbling at it with my lips. You enjoy the feeling and start to gasp, I discontinue as my head turns to your left and playfully bites into your inner thigh. I move away from you, and my hands start to pull on your leggings. You gladly oblige by moving your hips up a little, so I can slide them off first, leaving them on up to your knees, revealing your panty-covered cunt which already has a nice wet spot going on. With me biting my lip in anticipation, I proceed to remove your panties as well, revealing your beautiful cunt with its reddened lips, still attached to the panties as it finally lets go, leaving a string of your juice in between them.

""I'll make you feel better""

I lower my head, lifting your legs on my shoulders, leaving your legging and panties still on behind me. Covering your left inner thigh in kisses, I get closer and closer to your needy cunt. At this point your entire body aches to have my whole mouth there. Your clit is throbbing stronger than ever, that heat you have been feeling is increasing. Your legs start to shake, and you can feel waves of wetness escaping your ready pussy.
Finally my lips arrive, and I give you another kiss, which is immediately answered by you moaning desperately. Looking into your eyes, I begin licking away at your sweet and juicy center, with each and every lick driving you into deeper into arousal. My hands wander towards your hips to get a good hold on you, so you won't escape. I can feel the sweat on your thighs as they rub against my bearded face in a spasming motion. You, too, hold onto me tight by grabbing my head and holding it tightly against, followed by your legs wrapping themselves around me. With every single moment I can taste how much wetter you get, and I begin to fail lapping up all those sweet juices, and have them starting to run down your cunt, in between your legs, and slowly drenching your asshole in your nectar. Your eyes roll as soon as I begin sucking on your clit, alternating between sucking and licking your moaning intensifies. Completely at your mercy, you use me and press my face into you as hard as you can, crushing me with your legs and suffocating me with your pussy. Unable to gasp for air, I resort to my own way of taking your breath away and begin to cup your cunt with my lips and starting to suck, at the same time still licking away at you and increasing my steady pace.

""Fuck babe, I'm gonna cum already"", you say as I see your face melting in pleasure. I keep licking at that same speed and sucking, the grip of my hands on your hips harden. My eyes start to roll from running out of air, and likewise for you you are unable to keep eye contact as an immense wave of pleasure quakes over you, taking over your entire body that so desperately tries to get closer to me, holding onto me as hard as you can and rocking your hips against me. I can feel your cunt spasming on my tongue as a wave of warm pussy juice escapes you and floods right into my mouth. Your head tilts back and your entire body starts to shake. Losing control in a moment that feels like it is lasting forever, your body suddenly relaxes completely. I let go of your cunt, my face covered in your juices and strains of sticky wetness go in between the two of them. In between phases of immobility, rhythmically you convulse, as well as your cunt.

""Now it's my turn"", I say, gasping for air just as you.",1,1732280617.0,u_SmutAuthorsEscapisms,0,1.0,False
1gx7c6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gx7c6h/is_this_the_l_word/,Is this… the L word? ,"After a series of horrible dates and being stood up a few times I had given up and just decided to focus on myself. I went out one night with some friends and coworkers to celebrate a friend’s birthday and was introduced to a friend of someone in group. Immediately I was attracted. He’s an older man and looks great for his age. He’s in his late forties and in great shape, he honestly looks like he could be in his early to mid thirties. He’s in great shape and we made conversation about different workouts and supplements. I learned that he’s a veteran, well traveled, divorced (to a woman), and has a kid in college. We bonded over music, history, old movies, food, and discussed politics. We got along well as he’s young at heart and I’m an old soul. 

After everyone left we hung around the bar a little longer much to the chagrin of the bartender and got to talking some more. He mentioned that he lives kind of far away and is pondering getting a room for the night. I immediately understood what this meant. I walked him to the hotel and he got a room and he invited me up. We spent the night together and it was an amazing release for the both of us. Talking to him some more over coffee in the morning at a nearby coffee shop he said that he’s mostly retired and lives out on a farm on land his family has owned for many many years. He lives mostly by himself except for when family are visiting and he has his kid over. He invited me to come see him sometime and we exchanged contact info. He said he really does like me and wants to see me again. 

I wasn’t really expecting to hear from him again after but he texts me asking how I am and actually making conversation with me. It was a nice change from the usual drudgery of forced conversations and eventual disposal I’m used to. We make plans for when I’m off on a weekend and I made my way out to his farm. He gave me the grand tour and we had dinner, drinks, and sat around a fire. He played guitar and I played what I know how to play. We bonded some more and get physically intimate by the fire. It was so romantic (as corny as that sounds). We went inside and got intimate a few more times. We talked about our lives and plans for the future and he said he really does like me and can see something in the future with me. I told him I feel the same way. 

We made more plans before I left and he kissed me before I left, gave me a long embrace and looked sad when I pulled out of the driveway. We agreed to meet at a national park to go hiking and we hung out in the town nearby just shopping and hanging out like any other couple. We went back to his house after and worked out in his garage. We showered together and he made dinner. I eventually had to go and he said “I love you”. Without thinking I responded saying the same. It felt sooo good to be wanted and appreciated like that. I know he felt the same way. We kissed and said our goodbyes. Next weekend we’re going to hang out again. I always have a great time with him.

I hope I’m not moving too fast but he does seem to be into it as much as I am. What are your thoughts? Is this puppy love or can this be something bigger and more serious? 

TL; DR met an older guy through friends and started dating him after sex. He told me he loves me and I said the same. Can this be real or we moving too fast/playing at love? ",0,1732280613.0,askgaybros,10,0.5,False

Im 21F, have been diagnosed with PCOS and have had kidney stones. I got a Mirena IUD placed in October of last year because of pain associated with my period. At that time I did not have any diagnoses for anything. Incredibly long story short, my IUD caused a UTI that caused kidney stones, and when I was going through the ultrasound process for that, they found cysts on my ovaries and diagnosed me with PCOS (which I already knew I had, ive had every symptom for it for a while and every female member of both sides of my family has PCOS). 

Now, because of this diagnosis, I just assumed pcos was all I had. I felt like I had some of the well known symptoms of Endo, but PCOS has been known to mirror some of these, and since no one in my family has been diagnosed with endo, I thought it was just my PCOS. 

But now I'm starting to second guess myself a bit. My IUD is working GREAT and I don't even get my period, so I'm not sure if any of these symptoms are actually related to anything reproductive or hormonal at all. I've been cramping every morning for like 2 weeks. I thought it was coffee, so I cut that out and noticed no difference. I still experience pain during sex, but my partner is kind of large so I somewhat attributed to that. Regardless, I typically have some spotting a few days after I have sex. I'm always tired, but again, I did just recover from almost a year of having kidney stones, so I didnt do anything or really eat anything for about 10 months. But I got the kidney stones solved in August, so I feel like I should have rebounded better by now. 

But the symptom that is plaguing me the most currently is the frequent diarrhea. I woke up at 6:20 this morning (as of writing this it is now 7:48am) and I've already gone to the bathroom 4 times. They're definitely connected to the cramping. I know it's not lactose intolerance because I haven't had anything with dairy. It stays the same no matter what I eat. 

When I did have my period, cramps were debilitating. I'd be throwing up from pain for the first 3 days. But when I tell other people with PCOS this, they say PCOS doesn't cause painful cramps unless a cyst is bursting. This is making me question if women in my family also have endo and have just been never diagnosed. Is it even possible to have endo symptoms if you don't get your period anymore due to an IUD?? Basically, is this enough for an OBGYN to take me seriously? ",2,1732280027.0,endometriosis,2,1.0,False

**Memory Transcript Subject: Drejana, Anxious Arxur, Wildlife Management, \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service Dispatch\]**

**Date \[Standardized human time\]: September 30th 2141**

I awoke to a dichotomy of existence.

On one hand, it was terrible. Everything was overly sensitive. My mouth was thick with some awful, metallic tasting film. My scales itched from the constrictive clothes that were very much being tugged over my scales in uncomfortable ways. The pulsing thud of my own heartbeat was driving a spike of pain deep into my brain. 

On the other hand… My face was buried in the softest warmth I’d ever experienced. I knew the feel of it. The scent. Warm, sweet, a little flowery. The scales on my face were warmed as the fur cradled me, his heart beating slowly. The comforting *ba-bump* from *him* brought only comfort, even as the same beating in my head was causing misery. *This* wooly body did not bring pain. Especially because I could sense my brother nearby, on his other side, pressed in just as tightly. Our tails lay flopped over one another.

Even if I could move, I wouldn't have tried. Yes, from the comforting embrace I was basked within, but… As my brain dredged itself from the alcohol-soaked depths of the previous night, the comfort became suffocating, fading away. Soon to be replaced with shame and dread.

*‘Never touch booze again.’*

Gods; we told him *everything*. Sure, that was the plan, but we had intended to maintain *some* coherency; not drunkenly weep into Veltep’s chest. My scales grew heated, the throbbing pulse pounding harder at the embarrassment of recalling the sobbing fit that filled my mind. The sudden rush of blood made me wince into the wool, whimpering in pain.

I felt a warm, soft paw rest on my aching skull. Veltep began stroking, slowly, gently; his chest calmly vibrating as he let loose a quiet purr. I should have been shriveled up and dried out after last night, but more tears found their way to my eyes. He still cared. Even after baring our past. After making fools of ourselves and ruining the evening. He still cared for us.

I knew for sure that I loved him, then. He knew everything there was to know about who we are. What little there was, at least. We’d spent three-quarters of our lives imprisoned, we hadn’t started learning how to be *people* until a few short years ago. Hell, we were *still* learning. Even knowing that, the venlil showed us comfort, affection, and a willingness to still *be here.*

Reluctantly, I turned my head to pull my face away from his side. Vel adjusted slightly, allowing me to move easier, until my cheek rested on his still vibrating chest. I could already feel the lights stabbing through my closed eye. It took monumental effort, but I let my eye flicker open in a squint, peeking out at the world around me.

Nova was already awake, his nose tucked into the thick wool around Veltep’s neck, chin resting on his shoulder. I watched as a paw slowly stroked up and then down the back of my brother’s head, *our* venlil taking care of his bumbling, young Arxur.

After a minute, my eye opened the rest of the way. The pulsing pain hadn’t dulled, but I had finally gotten more used to it. As my blurring vision cleared and I could properly see, I studied the expression on Nova’s face.

He was gone, just as I was. Fully and completely fallen for the kind man between us. I’d never seen that look on his face before, but I understood it. I felt it. We’d opened ourselves to Veltep and though it was hard to properly recall the details, I knew he had accepted us. It was done! The worst part was over and it had gone right! We could be with him and there wasn’t anyt-

No. Wait. We never gave Veltep the chance to talk. There was still a very serious and obvious issue we needed to clear up before doing anything else. My face scrunched up in a single, sudden thought. *Fuck*

Soft laughter tickled my ear from above, the warm chest under my head bouncing lightly. I glanced up to find one of those gorgeous purple eyes gazing at me. I must have been more obvious with my face as my thoughts jumped around, because Veltep stroked a single digit gently between my eyes, smoothing my brow ridges gently as he traced down to the end of my snout. “How are you doing?” He asked, his high, bright voice softer than normal. An effort my headache appreciated.

“I’ve been worse.” I whispered, allowing a hint of my usual sass to tint my answer. Vel paused for a beat, his ears twitching in uncertainty before he shook his head and resumed stroking along my snout. The calming motion earned a happy rumble from me.

“I used to think listening to my Dad’s life stories was rough. It’s hard to even wrap my head around the kind of things you two endured.” He sighed, a slight whistle making both of us wince. That made Vel frown, his tail flicking down between our tangled legs. “As much as I hate the idea, I think we need to get up. At least so I can get you both something for those headaches.”

“Oh gods, yes please.” Nova groaned, rolling away from Veltep’s side to free him. The venlil slipped out from between us, stifling a whistle before padding off quickly toward the bathroom. As I sniffled down my tears, I realized that… would also be a *very* good idea. As soon as I could move again, that is. The sound of rushing water preceded our hero's return, a bottle of painkillers clutched in his paw.

“Here we are.” He fiddled with the tab, having to use his claw to get it open, before setting the bottle on the coffee table and stepping around into the kitchen, followed by the clink of glasses and rush of running water. By the time we sat up and got a few tablets shaken out of the bottle for each of us, Vel had returned, a glass of tepid water in each paw, which we both collected gratefully.

The venlil’s tail swayed as he watched us, signaling concern with his ears. We both chugged the water down, equally as desperate for hydration as painkillers. It really, *really* helped with the awful muck clinging to the inside of my mouth; it might be a while until I could brush, but hopefully Vel had some mouthwash at least.

After Veltep kindly got us a few more glasses of water, I began to feel less like a dried husk and more like a person. Nova had excused himself to the bathroom after the third glass, stumbling as he stood before disappearing through the door. My suspicions for mouthwash were confirmed, Veltep’s ears perking as we heard my brother gargling loudly.

Vel let out a tiny whistle, turning an eye to me as his tail flicked. “Uh… right. Well, I didn’t have specific plans for breakfast, but I did grab a few things for the both of you, just in case?” Vel’s voice lilted with a questioning tone, my brain taking a few extra seconds to understand the unasked question. I started to nod, before thinking better of it as my vision protested the motion, and flicked my tail in acceptance. Food didn’t sound *great* at the moment, but it was probably a good idea.

Veltep was still in the kitchen when I switched places with Nova, going into the bathroom with exactly as much grace as my brother, taking my time to attend to my immediate needs. I found myself in the mirror, after, noticing with annoyance the streaked makeup running down my cheeks. I had gone through the effort of getting some that was easy to wash, not wanting to deal with trying to scrub it out from between my scales. Again.

I ran hot water in the sink, huffing as I grabbed the bar of soap and getting to work scrubbing my face clean. It was a poor substitute for a shower, but only took a few minutes to get the job done. I made use of a claw… paw… I dried off with the little towel, before snatching up the mouthwash and desperately getting to work, letting the cleansing burn of the liquid swish around. Despite the sound exacerbating the pain in my head, if I didn’t get rid of this awfulness in my maw I was going to be sick.

I stuck my snout under the faucet, getting a mouthful of water to rinse. Then I repeated that a few times. Once my mouth felt mostly clean, I gulped some of the fresh tap water, finally standing upright and staring into the mirror. I felt like *me* again. The pain was still there, but slowly beginning to dull to the background. With my mouth refreshed and scales clean, I felt less nauseous as well. My stomach rumbled as the idea of food became much more appealing.

Now if only my clothes weren’t an absolute mess from sleeping in a pile on the couch, then I would have been-

*‘I slept with Veltep.’*

My scales turned *crimson* as I leaned heavily on the counter.

Wait, no. That’s not-

*‘Literally! I slept snuggled up with him!’*

Right. Okay, yeah. That’s accurate. *Wow.* Was I really focusing on that right now? It was ridiculous. I patted my cheeks, attempting to disperse the blush. After coming here last night in the spirit of being open and honest with each other, I had to keep the same expectations of myself. I had been… disappointed, having to stay at home, alone, while Nova and Veltep went off in the woods together. I knew it was work related. And I *knew* that it had been very helpful in getting Nova more comfortable with… well, everything.

But that didn’t make it any less painful to be left behind.

I tore my gaze away from the mirror and looked down at myself, focusing on my disheveled appearance. I took a few moments, along with some steadying breaths, to fix myself up. The blouse… was wrinkled. And covered in sandy fur. For some reason I found this endearing. And only the tiniest bit annoying as I couldn’t brush it away. I did my best to straighten it out and swipe the worst patches of fur off, before tucking it back into the belt. Then made a slight adjustment of the skirt, and did a very quick check on the garter belt underneath, making sure to keep the stockings up. I rumbled, pleased that I had somehow managed not to ruin them.

Finally feeling presentable once more, I exited the bathroom, walking more confidently into the living room to rejoin my boys. Nova was on the couch again, his head turned to watch Veltep in the kitchen. The venlil in question was at the stove again, a large frying pan sizzling away with a pair of thick ham steaks. He kept an eye on them while flicking his tail high, acknowledging my return.

“Any better?” He beeped to me as I returned to the couch, kneeling on it so I could rest my arms on the back and watch him easily. I took a slow breath before nodding. It still felt like my brain was moving independently of the rest of my body, but I didn’t feel so overwhelmed by every sensation now. His ears flicked happily as he took a bite out of some large fruit, shifting the pan with the other. “Mm. Good. This should be ready in a moment. I’ll bring them out, so just relax for now.” He instructed, tail flicking from me to sign *>Turn and sit.<*

I giggled a little, but didn’t argue as I turned and settled down, looking over at Nova as I did. He was sitting sideways, one leg tucked up underneath him, his head resting in his hand with his elbow on the back of the couch. I would have thought he had fallen asleep again if his nose wasn’t twitching at the scent of the ham filling the apartment.

My brother felt me looking at him, one eye opening and narrowing as it focused on me. The corner of his mouth twitched in a small, reassuring smile. For the last week there had been a constant, low level of tension within him. It was at its worst those first couple of days, but had gradually eased as he and Vel spent more time together. Looking at him now… it was completely gone.

He had completely let it go last night. He’d exposed the worst of himself to Veltep, and the venlil had simply accepted all of it. Comforted *both* of us. And now here he was, walking into the living room with two plates of ham steak for us. It was a jarring bit of domestic bliss that neither of us had ever considered a possibility.

“Here, eat up. Lucius always insists that something greasy helps with hangovers.” Vel whistled softly, the sound not nearly as grating as it was when I first woke. Progress. Though his words reminded me that there was still one more thing to go over, before this little ‘date’ fiasco could be considered successfully wrapped up.

Nova slid forward as he adjusted himself and quietly thanked Vel for the food, cutting off a large piece. I was cutting a much smaller slice, thinking about how to jump into the big question, when Nova swallowed his bite and beat me to it.

“Veltep, are we dating?”

*‘Are you fucking kidding me? You just fucking say it like* ***that***\*?!’\*

I gulped, barely managing not to choke as my tail thumped against the couch. Veltep stared at us both walleyed for a heartbeat, lowering the fruit in his paw to the table as his ears flopped down. “Nova!” I hissed, holding my fork threateningly as the thought of jabbing him seriously crossed my mind.

“What!?” He shot me an offended glance, before turning back to the venlil. “Seriously! I don’t…” He looked back at me, determined as he set his shoulders. “*We* don't actually know how to do any of this.” I scoffed, but couldn't actually argue with him on that one, stabbing the ham with more aggression than it deserved. While I’d done a bit more… personal research into it, there was an admitted lack of *experience* that I couldn't deny.

“That’s why this, why last night, was so important.” Nova said, leaning forward with his hands flat on the table. “We want this. We want this so fucking badly, Veltep.” The food lay forgotten as Nova stared the venlil down. Leaning in like he was, my brother was looking up at Vel, his dark-blue eyes absolutely sincere.

Vel was recovering from the abrupt jump into the topic, his tail twitching behind him in patterns I didn’t recognize, but his ears perked up at attention. They swiveled to me as I spoke up, an eye turning to focus. “It’s true. We really do. But there's been another huge issue standing in between us that we’ve… Well, ignored.” He must already know what it was, his tail signaling his agreement. I inhaled through my nose, exhaling slowly before I continued. “We haven't once discussed you and your husband. Not in relation to what it means for us. At first, all of this was just supposed to be some fun flirting. We liked you, but there was no possible way something like this could work, beyond the *obvious* reasons.”

Vel settled in more appropriately for this conversation. I took another centering breath before I continued, mustering all the confidence I had. “Why would we poke at that subject, right? I thought *maybe*, at best, we would be friends. That getting to know you would help us break through some of the lingering pain we still had.” I laughed dryly. “And fuck was it fun watching the two of you blush and stumble over each other.”

Nova snorted, swinging his tail around to thump me, while Veltep just let out a gentle sigh of exasperation, his face tinting orange. I grinned, pressing forward as my confidence swelled. “And then literally the day after we properly met and ended up cuddling here, you started flirting back! We had no clue what to think at first! Were you just being friendly? Was it just a case of giving back what you were getting from us? You completely threw us both off!” I said, jamming an accusing finger at him.

Vel looked appropriately embarrassed, tail coiling up in twists behind him as he whistled. “Yeah… I guess that was a little heavy-pawed right at the start.” He admitted, ears tilting forward as my brother and I looked intensely at him. Veltep squirmed under our combined scrutiny, looking down at the floor for a moment before lifting his head back up, eyes narrowing and then relaxing as his tail flicked sedately. “I was curious. It was pretty clear you liked me too, but I wasn’t sure how to go about it. Lucius was certain you’d never tried to date or anything before, but I found that hard to believe.” He was turning orange again. “You’re both just so… incredible. It seems impossible that no one’s ever tried to connect with either of you before.”

Our turn to blush now, as Nova gave a non committal grunt, and I looked away for a moment, tail twitching. “We weren’t ready.” I said, hands collapsing together tightly in my lap. “Plenty of humans were interested, but we weren’t.”

Nova grunted again, leaning back with his arms crossed. “We needed a lot of therapy. Still do. Maybe always will. But it was way too early to even think about something like this back on Earth. And here it’s been too… busy. And everyone’s too close, if that makes sense?” He looked at both of us in turn. I nodded my agreement, perfectly understanding what he meant. Vel did too I assumed, flicking his ears in assent. The town was still very small. We knew everyone as if we were one big extended family. Not a great dating pool for us.

Veltep continued to tug lightly at his wool, fidgeting. “I was getting that feeling the more time I spent around you and the town.” He flicked his tail as his head tilted slightly in thought. “There was still a lot that wasn’t ready to be said. I wanted to get to know you both better. And it’s kind of hard to figure out the right way to even broach that subject. ‘Hey, my husband said it would be good for us to get together, what do you think?’ I mean…” His tail was thrashing behind him as he let out a sharp whistle that made my head pulse in protest. “Especially when I wasn't sure how far things would even go!”

Nova snorted, hand covering his snout and rubbing at the soft blush still there. “No, I think we get why all three of us danced around the topic, we aren’t accusing you of hiding anything.” He stroked over the scar on his face absentmindedly for a moment, the pink flashing white under the touch. “Though that is certainly an interesting detail to hear.” He half mumbled, turning a bit redder at the implication that Lucius was encouraging this.

“Y-yeah. It was part of what I had planned for last night. To tell you about how our relationship worked and to let you think about how you felt about it.” Veltep said as his ears flickered erratically, gathering his thoughts while my brother and I nodded. “It’s sort of complicated, but at the same time very simple.” He said after a pause, causing Nova and I to share a glance, before returning our full attention to Vel. We both leaned back into the couch with expectant expressions. “... Right. Let me…” He flicks his tail once more, thinking for a moment before nodding.

“First, Lucius is, of course, completely aware of everything that’s been going on here. I haven't given him any personal details, mostly just my thoughts on how things have been going.” He said, gesturing between all three of us with his tail. “I wouldn't tell him what we discussed last night, aside from that we finally had a talk about your past. *That* would be up to you both, how much you do, or don’t, want him to hear.” His ears flapped softly and he let out a beep as he scratched at his snout. “I figured you would want the chance to get to know him better yourselves first and decide how much you want to open up to him.”

Reasonable. Nova agreed, as we both nodded for him to continue. Vel let out a weak beep, tugging at the wool tufts on his chest. “Um. As for *us*, I knew, once I got past the initial shock of everything, that I was interested almost immediately. Talking to Lucius helped put a few things in perspective.” Here he paused, still pulling at his wool as he broke his gaze with us. “It’s probably clear that Lucius and I have a pretty non-standard idea about relationships.” He continued to fidget at his wool, before looking back up at us. “He and I got together *really* quick back during the exchange program. And got serious even faster. But even then, we both agreed that there wasn’t a reason to limit ourselves to who, or how, we loved.”

Nova flicked his tail, head tilting. “You’re saying that you’re Polyamourous?” He questioned. Veltep signaled that he was correct with a swish of his tail. “Alright. That’s not *that* uncommon, I guess.” My brother shrugged his shoulders slightly, his eyes blinking slowly. “We’ve never had a reason to consider it, but we’ve seen it.” He said, head bobbing side to side like he was bouncing the idea around inside of it.

I giggled at the mental image. “Yeah. If anything, the whole idea sounds… pretty natural to me.” I let out a breath, thinking as I pressed back into the cushions of the couch. “This is still pretty big though. It’s not like we sat down one day and said ‘we need to find a nice guy that we could share.’” Vel’s ears flapped and the orange tint returned to his face. “We just both have feelings for you. Pretty strong ones. And the thought of… competing, or one of us stepping back, just… never entered our heads.” I explained, letting the thoughts put themselves together as I spoke, Nova’s nodding agreement spurring me on. “I mean, there were just these glaringly obvious hurdles between us.” I gestured vaguely between myself and Nova. “Being arxur, of course, but also being brother and sister. It’s… We know it’s kind of fucking weird to consider?” I finished with a worried flutter of nerves.

Veltep tilted his head, ears swiveling between us. “No? I mean, I suppose it *should* be?” He said, before cupping his snout in thought. “But it never really was. The fact that you’re twins was never a part of what attracted me. I simply got to know you, individually as people. The bond between you is part of what I love about you both, but not as like… ” He explained, the words coming slowly as he searched for them. “Whenever any of us tried to explore what this was becoming, your attention was on me, and never one another. You both are clearly a lot more relaxed with each other concerning certain… things. But there was never a sense that it was inappropriate.”

Despite whatever this whole situation was, or ended up being, there was still a distinct, comfortable line between me and my brother. Developing a relationship with Veltep didn’t change the relationship we had with each other. We were content around one another. We had explored our new identities together, shared everything the humans had to show us, and this would be more of the same. We would be there for each other as we learned what it meant to be in a relationship with someone. Learning to fully rely on them and not just each other.

“We might’ve gotten slightly off topic.” Nova said, bringing my attention back to the present. He was right. “We’re glad to hear that Lucius knows, and approves of what’s happening here.” There was more adorable blushing from the venlil. He nodded, listening attentively. “I think we should actually speak with him though. If only to be polite.” Nova let out a sigh, running his hand over the back of his neck. “But let's put that aside for the moment. Before we even worry about that, we still need to talk about how this is supposed to *work.*”

Vel took a breath, ears set again. “Communication, trust and understanding.” He stated plainly, tail emphasizing each point. “Those are the biggest parts of making something like this work. I’m confident we have trust.” Nova and I both flicked our tails in agreement, making his ears flicker happily. “Meaning what we need the most now is communication and understanding.” He deliberately turned his head as he looked from my brother and then to me. “So then the main question now is, what do you both want and expect of me and this relationship?”

It was our turn to stare walleyed for a beat. I recovered first. “I… I want us to be together.” I said softly, Velteps ears drooping at the longing in my voice. It caught me off guard just as much. “Sorry. It’s just-” Nova reached over, placing his hand on my knee. I grasped it tightly. “I never considered something like that before.”

Veltep’s tail twitched as he watched, and the both of us laughed at how obvious it was that he wanted to get closer. Nova gestured for him to come around the table, the venlil quickly springing around and slipping into the space Nova made in between us. Vel leaned into my side, his warmth pressing in comfortingly.

As I shifted slightly to hug him back, my brother spoke up. “I’ve already mentioned speaking with Lucius. Aside from that though…” He sighed. “That’s really the big thing, isn’t it? Your husband. Not just him either. You have a business. You’ve mentioned your parents a couple of times too. You’ve got a life to live back on Skalga, and you’re only going to be here for a few more weeks at best.” Nova’s voice cracked, making him pause to take a steadying breath. Vel’s ears pinned back on his head, his cheek resting on my shoulder as he looked back at my brother. “It’s not like we can come visit you on vacation. We’re stuck here, unless we want to go back to Earth. And I guess a couple cities on Leirn, according to Boro.”

Vel’s tail coiled around Nova’s wrist. “You need to understand what kind of future there is for us.” Veltep said softly, interpreting my brother’s unspoken plea. Nova nodded rapidly as he took a second shuddering breath. “That’s something we all need to discuss. It might not be easy, but this isn’t going to end along with the volunteer program.” Vel said firmly. I felt a knot that I hadn’t been aware of, slightly ease within my stomach. “We will talk about it as we go. Figure out all of our options and work together to find out how to make it work.” He continued, projecting confidence. A surety that he believed in this, in us, being a long term thing. It was reassuring for both of us. Nova smiled tremulously, nodding as he leaned in on Vel’s other side, pressing the venlil gently between us.

“What about you?” I asked suddenly, making Veltep’s ears perk.

“Me?” Vel beeped, tilting his head to look up at me.

“Yes. What do you expect of us?” I clarified, making his ears swivel; one stroking along the spines down the back of my neck and sending a soft shiver along my scales.

“Oh! Yes.” He wriggled a little, settling himself in between us more comfortably as he considered. We ended up in almost the same position as the first time we snuggled on the couch together. Veltep leaned back against my body and rested his head on my shoulder, with one leg stretched over Nova’s lap, my brother instantly beginning to gently stroke over his wool. “I said it just before actually. What I expect the most is for you both to communicate. To be open and honest with me. If something feels wrong, or if you’re unsure of something, I want both of you to come to me about it. Or even Lucius! If you have a question that might be awkward to ask me directly, or want some advice about anything, I'm sure he’d be happy to help you out just as much.” His tail twitched, the fluffy tip fluttering as his ears swiveled once again. “I also want to make sure neither of you try to put me ahead of yourselves.”

Nova and I both gave him confused looks, the venlil laughing out with a whistle as he lifted a paw to both of us. One reaching out to gently grasp the back of Nova’s hand, the other coming up to cradle my jaw. The soft pads on his digits sent gentle tingles through my scales. “Listen. We’re planting a whole new field of relationships here. The old ones might change slightly because of that, but that doesn’t mean we should uproot them entirely. Lucius and I are married. We have a strong bond that I cherish. It’s important to me, but that doesn't mean what we’re growing here is lesser because of that. Just different.” His paws began to move, slowly gliding up and down over Nova’s forearm, as I felt his digits lightly dig in behind my jaw. The tingles intensified, radiating from that spot all through my scalp and down the back of my neck, into my spine. “There might be some growing pains in the next \[weeks\], but I don’t want any of that to put me in between the bond you both already have.

“I also want you to be open to the possibility of change. You’re discovering a lot of new things about yourselves. I don’t want either of you to close yourselves off from any new possibilities because of me.” He sounded insistent about that in particular. I struggled for a moment to properly focus through this very new sensation he was causing. My eyes really didn’t want to stay open for some reason while he was petting me like this. I managed to think through it though, considering his words. I made my claws comb through his wool to try and help me focus.

It was difficult to even grasp the idea really; Keep ourselves open to new possibilities? To be fair, we never really looked before. We weren’t ready until now. But also, we knew everyone here, and the prospects were slim. I could see Nova branching out a bit maybe. Trish was the first to come to mind. But I knew there wasn’t anyone here for me.

Still, I knew we both needed to be open to it. Even if we figured out a way to make this work long term, which didn’t seem too unlikely, we still lived on different planets. He didn’t want us to sit here pining for him during the interim. He wanted us to be open to finding something more. I looked over Vel’s head, meeting Nova’s eyes and saw the same thoughts going through his dark blue eyes.

“We understand. We need to keep an open mind about things going forward.” I said. Veltep let out a happy little beep, turning his head and tucking his snout into my throat to nuzzle in. The feeling made me shiver, scales rippling all over. Nova laughed, smirking from the other side of… Our boyfriend? My stomach flopped at the realization that this was actually becoming official, excitement building up again.

I reigned it in though, as I noticed Nova fidgeting a little, his claws playing with Veltep’s wool while staring off to the side. I tilted my head, tail flicking up to catch his eye. He sighed as if trying to expel the anxiety from his body, before facing us again and nudging the venlil between us.

“Vel… How soon do you think we can call Lucius?”

They’re having a breakfast potluck at work from like 8:30-10 😭

When I saw the list of what people were bringing I just wanted to cry.

It’s fucking stupid I know because why the fuck is this hoe crying over food? 

I have been/still am dealing with an on going eating disorder and it’s been a constant struggle to find a healthy and reasonable balance and relationship with food. Just being around it unprompted has caused me great stress and I feel like an asshole anytime I decline food while everyone else indulges. 

For context, my mom grew up being told not to eat at other people’s homes because it indicates you’re not being fed well enough at home or that you’re greedy. I distinctly remember my sister and I bringing a mere drink and snacks from someone’s place we were invited to and she was livid. Likewise, if we had guest over and there was tons of food, my mom would make me a plate to ensure I got the “appropriate” portions. And we overall just didn’t eat that much when in public spaces. So when I finally moved out and was no longer under those restrictions, on top of living in an area where all kinds of foods were a walk away, I got carried away and that ED I thought I had recovered from came back and I have been struggling since.

When this fuckass potluck at work came up, again, I saw the list. They’re going to have >!Bacon sausage eggs!
fruit muffins quiche!< and all I could think was oh god I would devour all of this shit I need to call out of work.

I would appreciate any help , please!","Disclaimer : I apologise in advance for any linguistic mistakes. English is not my native language and as many of you may know cognitive impairment makes it pretty hard to use properly even mother tongue. 

I will try to keep it compact and readable. All lists are **random.** 

**1 - Brain Fog Main Symptoms  (since 10 years)**  

**\*obviously not all symptoms are running at the same time. They're just different manifestations of my brain fog** 

* Clouding. Inability to concentrate/ focus on anything 
* Severe cognitive impairment. Memory problems , difficulty thinking, not finding right words , slow thinking
* Lightheadness , dizziness 
* Slow reaction time , feeling like drugged 
* Fatigue. Yawning. Extreme drowsiness . 
* blurred vision , difficulty to read a book or a webpage 

**2 - Diagnosed Coexisting morbidities** 

* DPDR (since childhood , due to CPTSD) 
* Anxiety , mild Depression (diagnosis AFTER brain Fog started) 
* Turbinate hypertrophy  - Sinus headaches , 
* Neck pain + Tension Headaches (unclear if connected to sinus issues though, doctors disagree)
* GERD 
* mild IBS (under control)
* pulsatile tinnitus 

**3 - Doctors suck (small Rant :)** 

* Been to several specialties through these years ( ie psychiatrists , endocrinologists, ENTs , cardiologists , pulmonologist , orthos , rheumatologist and of course neurologists).  Had most basic blood tests and several MRIs. Nothing. 
* Doctors are not willing to help and I doubt they are able to handle anything that is not super evident even to a non professional. Any negative testing = it must be mental disorder lol . I guess ""mental disorder"" is a modern equivalent of ""being possessed"" with psys replacing exorcists. 
* Nevertheless , I have been on SSRIs, SNRIs, benzos etc  since this was the medical advice. They never ever helped . Not a single day , not a single time. Maybe they help a bit with anxiety but brain fog is always here. But I suppose I asked for help to treat my brain fog huh ? Fuck you docs! 

**4 - Medical specialties/ Tests I have to try yet** 

* Sleep apnea 
* Allergiologist 
* EEG ??? (would it make sense?) 
* angiography ??? (would it make sense?) 
* some more detailed test on sinuses if available (??) 
* some more detailed blood tests (???) 
* ADHD (??? )

  
**5. - Possible correlations. aka When my brain fog flares up or gets noticeably worse** 

* When physically or mentally tired. 
* After oversleeping or overnapping. 
* Immediately after intense exercise (ie running, weightlifting ) 
* When BP drops (but not under hypotension levels)
* After eating warm meals. 
* In cold or hot weather. 
* After morning ejaculation (always happened - way before brain fog became an ordinary disorder) 
* After breakfast (always happened as well). 

**6. - Caffeine.... and more**

* When brain fogged , I crave for stimulants. Caffeine (depending on quantity/quality) is the only thing that can make me feel better even for a while. Unfortunately when it wears off brain fog gets back worse than before. And it has the opposite effect if I increase the quantity , so I am only drinking a cup of coffee per day. 
* Same thing happens with nicotine , I am smoking a lot cause it somehow helps my inability to think. But the effect doesnt last much. 
* I have also tried green tea  and several supplements to no avail. 

**7. - Diet and foods** 

* I practice since many years intermitent fasting , it makes me feel slightly better in terms of energy . I mostly avoid breakfast and lunch , eat only dinner and healthy snacks. 
* Due to GERD issues I mostly eat light and clean. No sweets , no junk food , no fried food, no spicy food , no acidic fruits etc. Usually carbs , meat , vegetables , cheese and yogurt/kefir.  I also dont drink any alcohol or sodas .
* I have not found any correlations with food but havent tried thoroughfully an elimination diet other than GERD related. 

**8 - Questions to you....**

* The **most important one :  How the hell are you managing to live with this shit ?** I am unemployed since 2021 , I sold my appartment  in order to survive but my savings are running out , I got divorced and I don't think I will be able to function ever again. I'm not myself , I'm a f\*\*\*\* zombie that only finds relief in sleeping. I am disabled in effect , but nobody seems to care ? Whats the way out of it ? 
* Any insights regarding my symptoms ? Anybody that relates ? 
* Any suggestions regarding further exams , medication , supplements whatever that may help?

I’ve worked at Kroger for a few months now, but have always shopped here since I was a small child. It’s the closest store and walking distance from my house. So I visited it often for everything. I know the products well. 

I’ve been buying this Kroger brand Dutch hot chocolate for years because it’s fat free, sugar free and tastes great. Theres only 25 calories in it which is perfection for a nice warm, sweet late night drink after work with no weight gain as a consequence. This has been my routine but it’s been abruptly ended. 

I noticed they rearranged the store 2 weeks ago while I was out sick. The drink mixes were moved for a bit but when the hot chocolate was put back on the original shelf, it’s completely different. Now it’s in a bigger box with more calories and grams of sugar.

1gx6pdw,https://i.redd.it/48k9ulok5g2e1.jpeg,My Healing Diary Day 7,"Dear diary,

It's been a week since I started writing this diary. This had been one hell of a week. Haha. But it was the most necessary week since I felt freer and better now.

I had a sudden final phone call interview and I passed. Though I still have the scheduled one for later for another company... Regardless of the results of the other one, at least, I now have a backup job. I still do hope to pass this one because of their setup and their office is really pretty. haha.

I'm still scared but I wish to use that fear to move rather than be stuck. The more that I'm afraid, the more that I should throw myself into the fire for me to grow.

Anyways, as per the affairs of my heart, a question made me wonder today. When do I know I'm ready or fully healed? Is there a right timing? I honestly don't know. I mean, I'm not closing my doors even now. I'm still making friends and talking -with a bit of flirting! sorry! haha- but they know I'm not looking for anything serious right now. So when should I consider a serious relationship? I have no idea. haha.

The gaps between my exes were varying. Sometimes it took me just months.. then after my second ex, it took me literally years before I met my exhusband cause he caused me a different trauma. He didn't break my heart though, it was me who unintentionally broke his heart for his sake (It's a different story altogether though. haha)

Anyway, I'm getting lost in my thoughts again. So.. when do I know I'm ready to consider a serious relationship? I don't know. I wish I could experience a slow burn type of love. The type that I'll wake up and just realize I'm in love with a friend. I wish that future 'friend' or 'my person' would fall like that with me too. If he won't, then, that's fine. It just means he isn't the right person yet.

I can wait. I'll have to rebuild my life first. Do all the legalities with my exhusband. Care for and explain things to my baby. I still have lots of tasks to accomplish. So.. if you (whoever you are) are reading this, let me tick my boxes yet.. but there's nothing wrong with being my friend.. a coffee will also be good.

**Garbage collection**
Was told that garbage collection will come and get the overflow trash, but no truck came back to the neighborhood. Would like if garbage collection could come and get trash tomorrow, if possible. Overflowed trash is now in the empty herby
