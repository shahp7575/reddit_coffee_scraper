In a bit if a spot, not able to decide which laptop. I'm looking to replace my M1 air which unfortunately fell victim to coffee. Now I have two options. Microsoft Surface Snapdragon X Plus 16gb or the M4 Air 16gb. Both 13.8 inch laptops I believe.

Only reason I got the Mac air was for the screen quality with editing photos and compact profile. This was 3 years ago. Now I did get used to using MacOS but initially, I absolutely hated it. Still not a fan of the limitations.

My main concern about ARM on windows is compatibility and issues using any software. Has this improved over time?

Anywho, just looking for a fun discussion on this topic. Where have people travelled where the shops (and beans) have really blown them away?

For example, one of my favorite coffee shops in the world - Avellaneda in Mexico City - really highlights Mexican coffee in a way that just blew me way, and you got to enjoy the same beans through different brewing processes to see what it brings out.

1q94yim,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1q94yim/19f_introvert_searching_for_a_fellow_quiet_soul/,19F introvert searching for a fellow quiet soul to connect with gently,"Hello. I'm a 19-year-old girl and a deep introvert by nature. Crowds exhaust me, small talk drains my energy, and I thrive in calm, low-stimulation environments where I can think and just be. I've learned to love this part of myself, but lately I've found myself wanting someone who shares the same quiet wavelength. Someone I can get to know slowly, without pressure to be constantly social or perform energy I don't have.

I'm currently in college, spending most of my days between classes, studying, and retreating into my own world. I love curling up with fantasy books that pull me into other realities, watching character-driven movies or series that linger in my mind afterward, listening to soft indie, ambient, or lo-fi music while I journal random thoughts or doodle in the margins of my notes. I enjoy making tea or coffee exactly how I like it, taking evening walks when the streets are empty, and letting hours pass while I think about life, stories, or nothing at all. Noisy places, big events, and packed schedules make me tense. I need solitude to recharge, and I feel most comfortable when things move at a gentle pace.

I'm not looking for someone to change that or coax me into a more extroverted version of myself. What draws me here is the hope of finding another introvert who truly understands. Someone at ease with comfortable silences, who values one meaningful conversation over a dozen light ones, who would rather spend time together quietly reading, sharing music, watching something thoughtful, or talking about the things that actually matter than filling every moment with activity. I believe two introverts can build something special: respectful of each other's need for space, patient with opening up, and deeply present when we do choose to connect.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 24 who feel the same about being introverted. You don't need to be overly shy, just someone who recharges alone, thinks before speaking, and prefers depth over frequency in relationships. Distance doesn't bother me if the conversation flows naturally and feels worth nurturing.

If anything here resonates with you, please send me a message whenever you're ready. Maybe share what you enjoy doing in your own company, a book or album that's been keeping you company lately, or what your ideal quiet evening would look like. There's no need to respond quickly or be especially talkative right away. We can start small and let things unfold at whatever speed feels right for both of us. I'm simply hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little warmer and less solitary. Thank you for reading this far.",2,1768054090.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

1q94ufk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1q94ufk/tifu_by_leaving_the_shower_on_in_amsterdam/,TIFU By Leaving the Shower On in Amsterdam,"Ok so context, there's currently an abnormal snowstorm in Amsterdam.  I'm a traveling American and just came from a few countries, and the plan was for the European tour to end and resolve here.    And I'll admit things are tough -- I'm waking up early bothered by how America is doing.   I go to the Anne Frank house and can't help but think dark thoughts relating one party to what's happening right now.  So I wake up early....a little unhappy even.  I'm on an amazing vacation and I see patterns that make me sad.     I decided I'd go for a run -- my preferred way of coping.   I'll take a nice hot shower (my room is dry and cold, this will warm and wake my legs up) and then get to it and the endorphins and legwork will boost my day.

So I turn my shower on in my room -- I'm right near the museum district and have what used to be an inspired little writer's room as my hotel with a private bathroom.  The ventilation is poor.   The view and vibe are epic.  It's easy to see why artists made art here.  And then I decide to plot out my run, and as I do, get a bit lost and distracted by what's going on at home.   I take a hit of a leftover bit from a coffee shop to think on this.   And I'll be honest, I'm surfing social media and smothering the urges to comment with things like how I just visited the Anne Frank house and how important I think it is to not just follow the rules if the rule are leading to horrible patterns.....

And then I look up.  
My room, is white.  The steam is everywhere.  Holy crap -- the showers here are so so hot.  I can take a hot shower but this is boiling water spewing from the faucet.   I know this because my entire room, previously dark at an amsterdam 6am, is now a steamroom, and the light from my little laptop in the corner is just making a big aura of illuminated steam -- I should not have left the shower on and gotten caught up on my laptop.

Even though it's steam, the cloud is enough that my nervous system is having an ""oh no fire!"" reaction.   I open the window, which only opens from the bottom, and start fanning my steam out.

And then the smoke alarm goes off.  i didn't even know it was there.   But it starts blaring at 5:45am.    My nervous system doesn't even increase the register -- it's hitting with an ""and now this..."" vibe.

I take a bathroom towel and fan the steam out.   I turn off my light, but imagine that the hotel has a system where it's undeniably where is the smoke signal's source.  And sure enough, in a couple of minutes, just enough time for the hotel's staff to put on staff and identify and knock on my door....""knockknockknock""

Dutch people are friendly, but they are also direct in a way New Yorker's might look up to.   And when their friendliness is gone, they are also still direct.

I open the door, I am clearly an idiot.

""Hello.""

""Hi"" He is the angriest person I've ever met in this town and for good reason.

""I'm so sorry,"" I say ""I left the shower on""

""You were smoking"" he accuses.

Look I've talked with local police, but I've also been in his position and he's just an honest man having to deal with a situation and I don't need to make it dishonest.

""Yes,"" I admit  ""I took one hit""    I took 2 but that's close enough.  I really think the shower I forgot about set off the alarm, I really do, but he's not wrong. ""I'm so sorry.""

""well there is a fine, and the alarm is going off through the whole hotel.  And there is a fine.""  he points out.  He is very annoyed and I agree with him.

""Ok."" I nod and am sorry.  I think that I can afford the fine and plan to kick myself lots while paying it later.

""can you at least open your window?"" he says

I did.  I 3 minutes ago.  But the room is so stuffy and the window only opens from the bottom so it takes heavy flailing with a towel to get all the mist to the level that the window will evacuate....but that's also what I'm doing.

""Yes I did already, please you can see.  I'm so sorry.""   I stand to the side so he can see the room, the window, and my set up.  I'm really sorry.  I've woke an entire hotel up.  Is the fire department coming?  Do I have to talk to them as they give me a ticket?

He takes a look at the room, and gives me a thorough lookdown. The window is MISTED, covered in humidity.  I'm sure there's a smell from the two hits I did take, but it's also clear that there's a crapton of STEAM from a shower in the room.

""I'm so sorry"" and I nod to show that I understand.    He is the second least friendly person in Amsterdam I've met, and he certainly deserves to be higher, so I'm really sorry.

He see's the room and all of this and calms down a lot.   ""Ok,""  
  
Something flips  
  
""Thank you for saying something. I will go to the fire department and tell them it is mistake.   I think we can end this here.  Ok?""

""Ok."" I say.  It is 5:45 am, I've been dealing with a few things back home and I feel like such, such an asshole and I'm so sorry.  And all I can say in dutch is ""I'm sorry.""

He leaves, with a mission to talk to the arriving fire-people as I apologize to his back and I at a minimum need to buy pastries and let him know that I know I'm a dumbass.  I suspect that my not making him prove that I'm an asshole smoker and just shunting the blame onto hotel factors was a big deal but I'm still the hotel's jerk.   It feels reasonable that I'd pay a fine, and while I get that he probably won't make me, pretty embarrassing.  In Amsterdam it's like drinking -- you're supposed to do it in certain places, otherwise it's like drinking in inappropriate places, but stinkier.  It's also a big deal to not be a shitty traveling American these days, and I feel like I failed that.   Been thinking about this all day, because I deserve to.

tl;dr: Got busted for smoking 2 hits of the special stuff in my room because I left the shower running, woke up my entire hotel and made a friendly staffmember have a reaction that results in a proper shame.   Don't be a crappy tourist -- saving hot water and going outside clearly was the superior option.",0,1768053803.0,tifu,0,0.5,False

**You Are Not Alone & You'll Get Through This.** Know that you are not alone.

**There is a lot more to life than work and school.** Health, family, & friends always come first.

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life’s not just a race.** Go at your pace. 

This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

For the people who only go like once a month, please don’t contribute much to this as it probably doesn’t make a lot of difference to you.

  
So I’ve been a MovieClub subscribe since there launch back on September 21, 2021 without ever breaking my contract and I’ve been going to Landmark Cinemas for every single week since 2017.

  
I just don’t understand why we now have to suddenly pay a dollar extra for each singular ticket when the price was stable for like half a decade and their bigger competition doesn’t seem to be increasing their prices at all.

  
They‘re also not even upgrading the theatres or nothing. Every single one of their regular screens is only equipped with Xenon Lamps capable of only handling 2K Resolutions despite most American Theatres these days being already upgraded to Laser Projectors with up to 4K Resolutions. And yes I’m 100% sure right now that none of their regular screens are capable of doing 4K since they literally admitted it themselves with the re-release of Shin Godzilla in 4K where they had a note that regular screens are only capable of doing 2K and that only Laser Ultra screens ($6 upcharge) would be playing it in 4K if it was playing there.

  
Speaking of American theatres, moviegoing in America is as cheap as a cup of coffee in here since they only pay a monthly subscription fee from around $19.99 to $29.99 and they get to watch up to 16 movies or more with many other perks like free refills and even free up charges to anything at all.

  
My local Landmark still has 90% of their seats fully worn off, so please someone do explain to me on why do we have to pay a dollar extra for each movie ticket right now!",0,1768053020.0,LandmarkCinemas,1,0.33,False

1q94id2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1q94id2/whats_your_love_language_why_it_actually_matters/,What's Your Love Language & Why It ACTUALLY Matters: The Psychology Behind Connection,"ok so i've been diving DEEP into relationship psychology lately (books, research, podcasts, the whole thing) and holy shit, the love language concept is way more powerful than those cringe quizzes make it seem.

here's the thing. most relationship conflicts aren't about who's right or wrong. they're literally two people screaming ""I LOVE YOU"" in different languages and getting pissed when the other person doesn't get it. you're out here buying gifts while your partner just wants you to do the damn dishes. they're planning elaborate date nights while you just want them to tell you they're proud of you. it's exhausting.

**the five love languages breakdown**

• words of affirmation: you need to hear it. ""i love you"", ""you're doing great"", ""i'm proud of you"". without verbal validation, you feel invisible even if they're doing everything else right. criticism hits you like a truck.

• quality time: undivided attention is your oxygen. phone scrolling during dinner? that's a personal attack. you don't need fancy dates, you need presence. distractions feel like rejection.

• physical touch: not just sex (though that too). hand holding, hugs, sitting close on the couch. physical disconnect feels like emotional disconnect. you literally need touch to feel secure.

• acts of service: actions > words. making coffee, filling the gas tank, handling that annoying errand. when someone goes out of their way to make your life easier, THAT'S love to you. empty promises are your nightmare.

• receiving gifts: not materialistic, it's about thoughtfulness. the $3 candy bar they grabbed because they thought of you > expensive jewelry they felt obligated to buy. it's tangible proof someone was thinking about you.

**why this framework is actually genius**

most of us love others the way WE want to be loved, not how THEY need it. your acts of service partner is exhausting themselves cooking and cleaning while you're starving for a damn compliment. you think you're being an amazing partner, they think you're avoiding intimacy. nobody wins.

dr. gary chapman (the marriage counselor who created this framework) spent DECADES observing couples in his practice before writing ""The 5 Love Languages"". this book has sold over 20 million copies and honestly? deserved. it's not academic BS, it's practical psychology that actually works. the research backing it shows that couples who understand each other's love languages report significantly higher relationship satisfaction. makes sense right?

**how to actually use this info**

figure out your primary and secondary languages. most people have one dominant and one backup. then figure out your partner's (or friends, family, whoever). spoiler alert, they're probably different from yours.

here's where it gets interesting. your childhood usually determines your love language. if your parents were physically affectionate, you probably crave touch. if they were workaholics who showed love through providing, acts of service might be yours. we're literally walking around with these unconscious blueprints expecting everyone to understand them.

the app ""lasting"" is actually pretty solid for this. it's a relationship health app that goes way deeper than just love languages, includes communication exercises, conflict resolution tools, all that. way better than those free buzzfeed quizzes that just tell you you're a golden retriever or whatever.

there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Type in ""improve my relationship communication"" or ""understand attachment patterns better,"" and it pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and psychology books to build a custom learning plan. You can choose quick 10-minute summaries or go deep with 40-minute episodes packed with real examples. The voice options are pretty addictive too, like that deep, conversational tone from the movie Her. Makes commute time actually useful for once.

**the brutal truth nobody talks about**

sometimes you'll be with someone whose love language is exhausting for you to speak. if you're introverted and your partner needs constant quality time and words of affirmation, that's DRAINING. if you hate gifts and they need that tangible thoughtfulness, it feels performative. 

this doesn't mean the relationship is doomed, but it means you need to be intentional as hell. you're essentially learning a new language, and that takes effort. the question becomes, is this person worth that effort? because half-assing someone's love language is worse than not trying at all.

also, your love language can shift. trauma, life changes, different relationship stages. the touch-focused person who gets cheated on might need words of affirmation in their next relationship. stay curious about yourself and your people.

**real talk**

this framework isn't a magic fix. toxic relationships stay toxic regardless of love languages. but in healthy relationships where people genuinely want to show up for each other? this is the cheat code. it removes so much confusion and resentment.

the ""Multiamory"" podcast has incredible episodes on this if you want to go deeper. they break down love languages through multiple relationship styles and it's honestly fascinating. also recommend ""Attached"" by amir levine for understanding attachment styles alongside love languages, total game changer combo.

bottom line, if you're putting in effort but your person still feels unloved (or vice versa), you're probably speaking different languages. figure out theirs, teach them yours, and watch how much easier everything gets.

We get on great, have a mutual respect for each other and are both very attracted to each other. Recently drunken kissing at a party, one or two chats about our situations and morally obliged to stay with spouses and just a mutual “wouldn’t it be nice” chat that if we were both single we could have had a lot of fun. 

We are both in very complicated relationships and said we felt terrible about kissing but also felt bad as in a perfect world we would have had potential and felt guilty for thinking this. It was out of character for both of us.

He is quite shy/reserved/straight laced/ professional and I am a joker, silly but we get on very well. He is a manager and has always been very professional about what he replies back (can never be too careful nowadays with snowflakes and screenshots so I understand that)

As he said we would happily meet up occasionally for a coffee and genuinely innocent catch up as we’ve changed departments at work. 

Two weeks and radio silence, invite once and just a thumbs down reaction. I don’t mind or want to persue anything more but it hurts a lot that he’s gone into ignore mode. Especially as I have the character that no matter what happened I would be professional/friendly as always and not act differently. I am conscious we both have great reputations at work and want an easy career for us both.

1q94ekt,https://v.redd.it/nm9coh780jcg1,My DBD 920 is not going higher than 6.5 bar.,"Hey all.

I’m new to BDB’s. Please speak to me like a 7 year old in terms of BDB lingo. 

I’ve bought a BDB off a guy who only used it for a week and then had it in storage. He let me try it, the shot came out well.. i bought it.

I didn’t check the pressure.. it was reaching. I was looking for other things, such as shot taste and milk texture etc.

Newbie.

A week into it i realised that the shots don’t go over 6.5 bars ever.. even if i hold down the buttons. Same goes with a blank.. sits at 6.5

Ive looked on the internet and read forums and i ended up buying a solenoid replacement, went for an Ulka ex5 brass with brass opv upgrade too.. replaced them all nothing changed.. i’ve adjusted the opv as much as 3 full turns in and nothing changed (reverted those turns since, out of fear of too much pressure once i find the actuall problem)

I’ve done a descaler program, with the little screws to empty the boilers every time etc. 

Didn’t help, but i think steam pressure might be a bit better.

…. Do you guys have any idea what could be wrong?

Last .. a couple of my thoughts and what i’ve noticed.


1. When doing the descaler.. during the second phase when having to unscrew the brew boiler .. no water came out.. i’m not sure any water went in.. first two shots were weird, i has to throw them out and them ran loads of water though the brew head as i’m expecting it didn’t refill properly to rinse out the descaling solution.  It’s all good now but i’m not suspecting something is off with some component to do with that brewing boiler/ water intake into it/ something.

2. The water in bristol where the coffee machine was from is hard.. i think when put in storage for 8 months after 1 week of use, it wasn’t drained. That’s why i replaced the solenoid, pump and opv.


Please.. any help would be amazing! ",1,1768052641.0,Brevilledualboiler,0,1.0,False

Just a little background, I’m 23F. I am around 5’2 in height and 120 lbs. My family all has high cholesterol. I knew I was higher side since I was 18. Lifestyle wise, I do try to eat healthy, less fried, little to no fast food, I only have alcohol once in a few months, limited sugary drinks and I don’t eat much sweets. I am Asian so do eat lots of white rice. I mostly eat baked chicken breast when I’m home. Lots of chicken and fish. Lots of fruits as well. I haven’t been exercising much lately tho. I feel totally normal. I don’t have any chest pain or shortness of breath. One thing different about me is I sleep a lot really quickly as well. I fall asleep in car rides or even just when I’m bored. I did get diagnosed with narcolepsy but haven’t been taking meds for it. I honestly think the narcolepsy is on the very mild side that I just drink a cup of coffee and take one nap in the after last me to the end of the day. 

I did take one month of meds for lowering my cholesterol earlier 2025 but stopped as the doctor only said one month. To be transparent, the last 6 months of 2025 I have been traveling alot and not been exercising. 

The normal rates for these are 
Cholesterol- 130-200 mg/dl 
Triglycerides- 60-130 mg/dl 
LDL - 0-150 mg/dl 
HDL - 35-65 mg/dl

These have been my past test results 

1/10/26 
Cholesterol- 291.5 mg/dl (v high)
Triglycerides- 29.21 mg/dl (v low) 
LDL - 217.96 mg/dl (v high) 
HDL - 67.70 mg/dl 

9/14/25
Cholesterol- 216.20 mg/dl (high) 
Triglycerides- 35.74 mg/dl (low)

HDL - 82.32 mg/dl

6/23/25 
Cholesterol- 235.60 mg/dl(high)
Triglycerides- 46.20 mg/dl (low)
LDL - 153.15 mg/dl 
HDL - 73.21 mg/dl

2/4/25
Cholesterol- 227.90 mg/dl(high)
Triglycerides- 34.06 mg/dl (low) 
LDL - 157.49 mg/dl 
HDL - 63.60 mg/dl

I have a few questions
1. Is it normal for my total cholesterol to jump so high so fast?
2. Why is my triglycerides getting lower and lower. It’s more than half the normal value 
3. What should I do to lessen my cholesterol? I know I might have to take meds but ideally would like to reduce it myself as much as possible. I don’t wanna rely on meds the rest of my life. 
4. Do you think these cholesterol levels is symptom of something else?

Nowadays I suffer from depression and anxiety. I live in Slovenia. I’m a big Man Utd fan. I travel every year from Slovenia to Manchester to watch a match at Old Trafford. I would say I’m a lazy type of person and spend a lot of time on social media like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and TikTok. I dislike doing chores and long walks in nature. I live in a medium large town. I like edgy type of humor. I have a very good memory, also very good working memory. In High school I was good at Languages, History and Geography. I struggled with Math, Chemistry and Physics. I’m the type of person who is quick to anger. I like routine. I’m kind of disorganized. I like to eat good and want a good car. I’m worried what other people think about me. I’m superstitious. My religion is Christianity. I have very good verbal and communication skills. I’m interested in MBTI and Enneagram. I can be an impulsive spender when it comes to money. I can be Schadenfreude sometimes. I’m sensitive and easily insulted. I have a tendency to bedrott. I like travelling with Airplanes. I often worry about my health. I honestly trust only my family members. I dislike drinking water and alcohol. I love people who have good intentions.

This was my first time in a healthy relationship with someone who genuinely liked me, and it was so hard to navigate 

My ex and I met on Bumble over summer, she broke up with me in November because of her depression and overwhelm (more context on my profile, we’re both women in our mid/late 20s doing postgrad degrees and also both very fearful avoidant. She told me she was, I never told her I was because I was in denial 🥲).

I texted her on NYE asking if we could go for coffee or generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to talk and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country in a couple of weeks.

The purpose of this (for me) is to open up about my avoidant behaviour during the relationship (it’s not like I’d shut her down, I just never opened up in return, like I’d clam up and just felt like I was going to cry if I opened my mouth) and to see if we can move forward together with the added context of neither of us being ready for the intensity we had. 

I don’t know if I’ve done this right? And I don’t know how to read if she’s seeing this as closure or not, she was kind and said she hoped I’d had a nice Christmas but no questions or anything (in fairness, I didn’t ask any questions either and she hates texting at the best of times). I’m really panicking, I didn’t expect her to say yes and I’m so insanely stressed  about actually having to be vulnerable even though this is what I wanted 🙈

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋 Ever feel like you're juggling a dozen things and some of them are about to drop? Yeah, me too. But lately, I've been experimenting with some super simple shifts, and honestly, they've made a huge difference in my productivity, my peace of mind, and even just my overall enjoyment of the day.

It's not about grand gestures or overnight transformations. It's about those tiny, consistent habits that stack up.

Here are a few things that have been working wonders for me:

*   **The ""Power 3"" Morning:** Forget trying to conquer your entire to-do list before breakfast. I pick just *three* absolutely essential tasks for the day. Completing them first thing gives me this incredible momentum and a sense of accomplishment that ripples through everything else.
*   **Micro-Breaks for Macro-Results:** I used to push through for hours, but now I schedule short, intentional breaks. Think 5-10 minutes to stretch, stare out the window, or just breathe deeply. It’s amazing how much clearer my head feels afterwards.
*   **Single-Tasking is King (or Queen!):** Multitasking is the enemy of deep work and peace. When I’m focused on one thing, I’m *really* focused. It means shutting down notifications and giving that one task my full attention. The quality of work goes way up, and the stress goes way down.
*   **Gratitude Moments:** This is a big one for joy. I try to consciously notice three things I'm grateful for throughout the day. It can be as simple as a good cup of coffee or a supportive message from a friend. It shifts your perspective like nothing else.
*   **The ""Unplug"" Ritual:** Before bed, I have a strict no-screen rule for the last hour. Instead, I read, journal, or just chat with my partner. This helps me wind down and actually get decent sleep, which is the foundation of everything.

It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and feel overwhelmed. Sometimes, when things get really tough, having support is crucial. If you're looking for ways to navigate those challenging emotional landscapes, you might find **this resource (affiliate link)** incredibly helpful.

I'll be staying in Nakano, so plus points if it's anything in that area.

I've also wondered if I can go to Jazz Kissa in the afternoon instead of evening, and if it's ""normal"" to show up alone (just like most other places in Tokyo)? My expectation is basically ""walk in, order coffee, sit down and enjoy the music"".

I'm also interested in these little basement live jazz places. (Not sure what they're called...) Do you have any recommendations? Is there anything in terms of etiquette that I need to be aware of? (E. g. drink orders, wardrobe, etc.)

Day 1: eating less is almost a relief. The next gen soups taste much better than the powdered stuff I tried during my one day reset last year. Low key headache all day likely caffeine withdrawal.
Day 2: I’m sort of obsessing about what I can eat but it’s mental. I am not super hungry until my typical lunch time, and once I eat I’m back to normal. caffeine headache lingers.
Day 3: nervous over the lack of food in the day 3 kit. I’m good after breakfast, but after lunch I’m dreaming of dinner. Good news though, by afternoon my headache is gone. Bad news …gastrointestinal issues. Honestly I was a more hungry day three but never starving.
Day 4: other than some mild gastro upset I’m good in the morning. I have energy and can still think clearly and work (which was initially my concern before I started) . Was a little tired after lunch and slept really well that night. 
Day 5: I’m so excited for day 6 I’ve been asking chat gpt for transition food options all day. I feel light. I weighed myself and down 4 pounds. Likely water weight, but bloat is gone. I have energy all day. Sleep isn’t great and my gastro issues are in full force
Day 6 transition to real food: I was so looking forward to a half caffeinated coffee this morning, but my stomach is still not right. Had a 1/2 baked potato with Olive oil and some herbal tea. After about 45 minutes my stomach issues are better. I feel light and energetic…fingers 🤞 the rest of the day goes well.
Thoughts: there was only soup I didn’t like, but I was hungry so I ate it. All the other soups etc.. were good. Luckily I like Olives so I viewed those as a treat. Drinking herbal tea was helpful to keep my mind off eating. Drinking the L Drink all day felt like a chore, but supposedly that it protects muscle mass so I did it. I attended the daily coaching calls and were a helpful distraction, but somewhat of a sales pitch (which is annoying). The presenter was passionate about nutrition and it showed. Overall I feel lighter and have energy. I view this week as a reset post holidays with the real bonus of autophagy. Would do again in 3 months assuming no other issues pop up or sooner if my eating falls apart again.

I get the same thing your heart is healthy, with occasional resting high heart rate 115-120, love of 100-110. Also not made worse by coffee. 

I have a history of Endometriosis, GERD,IBS, anxiety,depression,AudHd, CTPTSD,fibmyalgia, psoriatic arthritis, and Lupus, with some mystery inflammatory condition im working with my arthritis clinic on an official diagnosis.

 My medications are: Prenatal vitamins, Cardia XT, duloxetine, vitamin D2( just started this week),

 Except I'll get runs on SVTs, that I can feel,my old doc said it's my heart beat running together multiple times, but it feels like my heart doing a backflip. 

And my high heart rate just sitting or sleeping at night is 90s-100. And on occasion, when im doing regular activities. I have no trouble when im actually exercising, and my cardiac output is normal, it's more a baseline, heart rythim issue that doesn’t get better or worse with activites. No POTS symptoms either.

 It'll skip,and I feel like sleepier than usual, I need to cough, I noticed it'll happen more, when my iron is low,during when I need to have my menstrual cycle and im feeling oddly ""off"" last time was in September.

 When I went a month without my norethedrine, birth control ( symptoms were tired, extreme fatigue and drained) and it happened all day, got a little better when I napped, but still ""skipping"" and my head felt fuzzy like if I closed my eyes it'll feel better. But it'll still give me runs of it. I told the doctor when it happens ill have several in row over 2-3 a days.

Ill list the most important ones first although you should try to implement as much as you can of this:

* Eat in a Caloric Deficit of around 600-1000, yes it might seem like a big deficit, but thats the whole point, you wanna get in and out a cut-phase fast. The idea that you should do a prolonged deficit of around 300-500 is flawed in many ways, mainly because your body adjusts metabolically unfavourable over time. The first option is gonna leave out most metabolic damage.
* Start with nicotine, either 100% tobacco or nicotine pouches (10-50mg), it has appetite supressing and metabolic-rate increasing effects .
* Stop drinking Fruit-Juices. This is a mistake that is all too common, eat whole fruits instead, ie. oranges, pineapples, etc. you do want the fibre because it supresses, appetite makes, you feel full and so on.
* Start taking Thyroid.
* Drink 5+ Cups of Coffee daily -> Caffeine has an metabolic-rate increasing effect while supressing appetite.
* Walk 10-20k steps a day (easy not distressing way to burn calories)
* Drink as much skim milk as you can while still leaving room for other foods, mainly fruits.
* Avoid too much meat and adding fats (coconut oil if anything) or atleast drastically reduce it and only consume exceptionally lean meats. (avoiding the Randle Cycle and doing some form of protein restriction mainly avoiding methionine, cystine & tryptophan helps)
* You should be having (5% fat, 25% protein, 70% carbs) macros-wise
* Supplement vitamin D3 (5000-10000 IUs daily), Thiamine, Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin E and maybe Berberine (although ive never tried it myself).
* Men could benefit from some DHT, and women from Progesterone.
* Avoid Starches (Especially grain-based, potatoes can be fine for some, figure out & find out for yourself), I consume them myself, but thats because im trying to maintain my current weight.
* Try to do under 2g of Pufa.
* Salt to taste.
* Dont fast.

I dont think much of this is stuff that youve never heard of, but still i hope it will help someone out there, especially someone who is new to peating and may have gained a bunch of unwanted fat.",7,1768051325.0,raypeat,10,1.0,False

1q93wz7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q93wz7,The long Peräjärven walk,"So i did this few weeks ago before MWC was released but didnt bother posting it. But i have a feeling it is the right time.

Basically i was interested in alternative routes through the map, using bus, measuring things - whats better to turn left or right on the first crossing, looking into how much running and walking differs in terms of water consumption, something like that. And decided to do this walk marathon. Additionally weight system caught my attention, was intrigued by it, never before i pay any attention to it. And most importantly, I felt like doing it. I always loved how relaxing the game felt. It's a really simple combination of wilderness sounds, but it works! Perhaps they are unique and not from some free stock sound market? I don't know. Took me a few real-life days to commit to it though.

So here it goes. I started the game looked at the clock it was 8 A.M. Monday—and weighed myself: 79 kg. Did the piss-in-the-shower routine, ate 4 grilled pikes for the long road ahead. Also drank lots of water—3 piss runs to be exact. Checked the clock again it was almost 9, started my real life fitness watch timer and exited the house.

12 minute mark and i made it to railroad crossing. A minute and a half later and here comes first crossroad, turned left and continued my journey. At the start of this i have a brilliant idea of using autowalk mod, but it turns out to be buggy. No head bob animation and no foot sounds. So i played it safe (thought it might not count as walking in terms of weight loss or anything) and used my finger on the W the whole time.

20m and here we are at furthest sewage house + road to the asphalt and the bus stop. Decided i gotta measure that as well and made a back-and-forth trip. 23.40m and i was back on track. So it kinda like 2 minutes to the bus stop from here and 22m to the bus from home. Also here i noticed first sign of thirst coming up from negatives.

28m Firewood guy. Nothing special here didt took a screenshot even.

30m Hello Jokke! Should have brought him Kilju. 1 minute later made it to railroad crossing again just in time to see the train up close.

40m mark made it to Fleetari garage. Didnt have a wristwatch, so i tried the door it was already closed so past 16 P.M.

51m Dance hall. Saw some guy in the woods on the way there. First sign of hunger here.

57m Pigman mailbox. Getting dark. 1hr 03m hay barn. Exactly at the radio antenna, thirst become red. I think i saw Pena 3 times, it is not documented well but this is how i write it down.

1hr 10m. Finally made it to Tiemo. Didnt make it in time to make any purchases, but the pub was working. Ordered 3 coffees and made a trip to the water pump. Didnt want to die at this point, but i think it was safe bet that ill made it home without drinking. All that in 4 minutes. Looked inside to see time it was almost midnight. Bus was a sweet temptation, but I resisted and continued.

From 1h14m to 1h29m walked along the highway, that was the darkest moment. Thought the lights from passing cars would help, but not really. They were rare and they do blind you so well that you have no idea if you safe or not. But i made it Rykipohja. Was glad to se sun again.

1h34m walk past strawberry field. Gotta say this part is least interesting in terms of walking around. Nothing to look at really. Hunger became red at the 1h44m near the dirt ditch track.

1h53m was about to share morning coffe and surprise grandma with early wisit but she wasnt there. Was i too early? Dont know but that was kinda disappointing at this point.

Exactly 2h mark - turned towards the house. I had written down that i saw Pena 5 times in total. Thats probably 2 times on the way back and 3 on previous day.

And 2h 13m im home! Finally can move my finger somewhere else than the W key. Took a look at the clock it was 11.45 A.M. Weighed myself—yeah, I did lose some weight, cant say how much really. 1-1.5kg probably. All in all if i didnt walk to the bus stop and back and didnt drink at Tiemos, that should be exactly 2hrs real time and 24hrs in game time. And that is neat.

That trip was something and it taught me some things. First of all im not that scared to walk around anymore. Especially if you run around. Like im fine with idea of getting abandoned house wheels on a boat now. Or even walk there on foot (more below). You have more than time to simply walk out of any situation if you didnt forget eat for 2hrs straight or something. There are a lot of whater pumps for you to basically run around. Other interesting thing i never thought of before - you can navigate using a sound in a pitch black environment. When i was walking on a highway i couldnt see but i could tell when im on asphalt or not. Same goes for dirt roads. Nothing special but neat. Also the the Skii thingy high in the sky save me from losing my mind. Was the first thing i saw after complete darkness. And the last one - looks like it doesnt matter left or right, they are the same.

So after that i did some more testing with weight (using the editor) and time to get to places, here are the results. Runing from home to boat - 40 sec. Walking 1m10sec. Running while being 340kg 1m.30sec, walking - 2m40sec. Found out that you wont get any speed boost if you lose more weight than 80kg. It stays the same, so from the start of the game you allready have maximum speed. It takes 8 minutes of running from home to the first dirt crossing. It takes roughly 12 min of running from house to the abandoned cottage using shortest way possible along the shore edge. You will get scary red thirst along the way but i made it in time to drink. 5 minutes is the boat trip from home to fleetari. Bus trip from Tiemo to nearest home bus stop is only 5 minutes. 8m30sec driving with Pena from Tiemo directly to home.

So I'm currently employed an hour north of Seattle but I've been trying to find a new job to lead me onto the career path of a Cloud Engineer (or adjacent) post B.S. I can stay at this company but it doesn't really have the growth I'm seeking towards my career path. I'm looking for remote or Seattle-area roles, but honestly I'm willing to relocate anywhere that can benefit my career path.

This current position is a tech support job for a telecom company - mostly consisting of occasional calls regarding internet, email, VoIP as well as internal infrastructure and NOC monitoring. While it has been beneficial in breaking into the broader tech field, I understand it's really not super adjacent to anything more advanced in the career I'm pursuing, though of course bits and pieces might be. What was important is it was a good way to balance my life with school and certificate studying - but now that school is concluded, this job really has run it's course and I wish to start looking more towards my career path and be compensated more.

  
I've only applied to 50 some jobs since September, which I know isn't a lot - I was planning on applying to more but I'm getting conflicting advice on quantity vs quality - what is the best take of this? The main roles I'm targeting are Cloud Support, NOC Engineer/Analyst or SysAdmin. I'm actively pursuing the AZ-104 and trying to get more personal projects in so I can have a worthwhile GitHub to show. I think considering the roles I'm applying for this should be enough but please correct me if I'm wrong. My work is gently pushing me to get the Network+ but it's not really a priority for me right now.

  
Next is networking. What's the best way to go about this? I have made some LinkedIn connections but I don't know how to approach people for advice, let alone coffee chats or anything further. I also don't know if going to in person events is worth it at all.

What stages do they have? How do you apply? Who do you contact? And most importantly, how do you actually get the checks?

I've seen people here projecting US/EU/UK scenes onto Morocco.

Y Combinator vibes, fat checks, global networks, and then hitting a reality check.

We're far behind, but that's not all bad.

We have our own ecosystem that's growing, just differently.

In this post, I'll debunk some misconceptions, so you have a clear idea.

**Common Myths vs. Reality:**

* **Myth:** ""It’s all about the tech.""
* **Reality:** It’s about **""Digital Inclusion.""** If your pitch doesn't mention jobs, rural impact, or ""Made in Morocco,"" you won't be considered for the program.
* **Myth:** ""Everything is online.""
* **Reality:** Technopark walk-ins still beat online forms. **Renew Capital** just opened their regional HQ in Casa Technopark. Go there. Physical presence in Rabat/Casa is non-negotiable for the big checks.
* **Myth:** It's like **YC** apply online, demo day, instant millions.
* **Reality:** Most programs are govt-backed or local accelerators. Applications often need local connections, paperwork, and patience (3-6 months wait times).
* **Myth:** Equity-free grants for everyone.
* **Reality:** Funding is tiny (20k-500k MAD), often tied to equity or milestones. Pre-seed angels exist, but expect intros via networks.

**How to Apply & Get Funded:**

The ""Startup Label"": Apply for the official label (Jeunes Entreprises Innovantes) via the [ADD](https://www.startuphub.ma/). Without it, the new tax breaks and FX (exchange rate) reforms won't apply to you.

LinkedIn and Events: Search for Program Leads at Tamwilcom and Technopark. Don't spam; ask for a brief coffee meet.

The VB Track: Pick ONE of the 6 partners, I recommend 500 Global if you want scale, or Flat6Labs for local seed.

That being said, there are many aspects that can help you get into the programs: applying early and showing potential.

Your idea shouldn't be revolutionary. I saw people get checks for repetitive ideas with a twist, a new niche, or a unique value proposition.

The gravel lot was already half-full when Peanuts pulled in, dust puffing around the tires like dry breath. Someone had strung Christmas lights between two rust-speckled light poles, even though the sun hadn’t begun to drop yet. Folding tables were pushed together in crooked lines. Coolers sweated into the dirt. A hand-painted banner hung slightly crooked between two trailers:

**CONGRATS LILY — PRO NOW!**

The paint was thick and uneven, the letters a little too enthusiastic, like someone had leaned into the brush too hard and decided that was just part of the charm.

Mee-Ma stood in the middle of it all like a general inspecting her troops, white hair pulled into a knot so tight it looked like it was holding the rest of the park together by sheer willpower. Lucky Dave leaned against a picnic table with his arms crossed, sunglasses pushed up into his hair. Around them clustered the rest of the trailer park pros — folding chairs, cigarette smoke, laughter, arguments about joseki bleeding casually into arguments about pickup trucks.

Baduk boards were everywhere. On tailgates. On card tables. On overturned plastic storage bins. Stones clicked constantly, that dry, comforting clatter layered under the hum of voices and distant cicadas.

Gia and Nada were out of the car before the doors were fully open.

They bolted straight toward the other kids, ponytails bouncing, sneakers kicking up dust, already shouting names and inventing rules to a game that hadn’t existed five seconds earlier. The trailer park kids absorbed them instantly, like they’d always been part of the same pack.

Peanuts climbed out more carefully, smoothing her shirt, already mid-sentence.

“…and I’m telling you, if they don’t consolidate behind someone early, the primaries are going to turn into a clown car. You can’t run a serious platform when half the field is just auditioning for cable news contracts—”

Mee-Ma snorted.
Lucky Dave grinned.

Peanuts didn’t slow down.

Lily stepped out last.

Fourteen years old. Newly minted Dan-1. Small, still — narrow shoulders, straight posture like a drawn line. Her hands folded naturally in front of her as if they had somewhere specific to be even when they didn’t. Her face was neutral in the way still water is neutral: not empty, just unreadable.

Everyone noticed her immediately anyway.

Conversations tilted toward her without anyone consciously choosing it. Heads turned. Smiles sharpened. A few people straightened their backs instinctively, like the room had gained a quiet gravity.

Mee-Ma crossed the gravel and pulled Lily into a hug that was firm and unapologetic, smelling faintly of cigarette smoke and vanilla.

“Well look at you,” Mee-Ma said. “Fourteen and already making the rest of us look lazy.”

Lily stood still inside the hug, relaxed but unmoving.

Mee-Ma released her and squinted at Lily’s face, then nodded once, satisfied.

“Yeah,” Mee-Ma said, as if Lily had spoken. “Feels real now.”

Lucky Dave followed, resting a hand lightly on Lily’s shoulder — not a possessive gesture, more like a calibration point.

“You did good,” he said. “Real good. Enjoy it today.”

Lily met his eyes.

No smile. No nod.

But the way her gaze held steady — calm, precise — carried something like acknowledgment. Gratitude, maybe. Or simply alignment.

Lucky Dave understood anyway.

The cake came out a few minutes later — sheet cake, grocery-store frosting, the word **PRO** spelled in blue icing that had started melting in the heat. Fourteen candles leaned slightly, wax already softening.

Someone started a sloppy rendition of Happy Birthday. Half the park joined in late or early or off-key. Gia and Nada ran back long enough to shout the loudest parts before being pulled back into whatever game had escalated into yelling and laughter.

Peanuts was still mid-rant at the far end of the table.

“…no, see, it’s not even about ideology anymore, it’s about structural messaging. If you can’t explain your tax policy in a sentence that fits on a bumper sticker, you’re already losing the Midwest—”

Mee-Ma rolled her eyes affectionately.
“Lord help us.”

Lily stood in front of the cake.

Fourteen flames flickered. Tiny heat distortions wobbled the air between her and the frosting.

Everyone leaned in slightly, waiting.

Lily didn’t close her eyes. She didn’t clasp her hands. She didn’t perform a ritual wish.

She simply leaned forward and exhaled.

All the candles went out at once, smoke curling upward in thin gray threads that twisted together before dissolving into the afternoon air.

Applause broke out. Someone whistled. Someone clapped too loud and had to shake their hand afterward.

“Make a wish?” someone called.

Lily’s face didn’t change.

But something in her stillness made the question feel already answered.

Mee-Ma chuckled softly.
“Kid doesn’t waste wishes on nonsense.”

Plates were passed. Cake was sliced unevenly. Frosting smeared onto paper towels and fingers. The smell of sugar mixed with dust and cigarette smoke and hot plastic.

Baduk boards kept clicking in the background.

Lily took her plate and stood slightly apart from the cluster, watching the movement of people and boards and children and drifting conversations. Her posture stayed perfect. Her face stayed unreadable.

But inside her chest — unseen, unshared — something tight refused to loosen.

Everyone loved her.

Everyone believed in her.

Everyone saw certainty where she felt thin glass.

She watched Lucky Dave laughing with one of the older pros, the sunlight catching the edge of his sunglasses. She watched Mee-Ma correcting a kid’s grip on a stone with gentle authority. She watched Gia and Nada dart past in a blur of dust and noise and fearless motion.

All of it looked stable. Solid. Permanent.

She felt none of that.

The applause still echoed faintly in her ears — not sound anymore, but pressure. Expectation. A rising shape she wasn’t sure she could keep standing on forever.

Her fingers tightened slightly around the edge of the paper plate.

No one noticed.

----

The game had migrated inside as the heat softened into a lazy, buzzing haze. The trailer’s small salon smelled faintly of old coffee, dust, and sun-warmed vinyl. The window was half-clouded with grime, turning the late afternoon light into pale amber bars that stretched across the board like prison shadows.

A box fan rattled in the corner, pushing warm air in slow, uneven pulses. Somewhere outside, kids shouted and a screen door slapped shut. The party noises had dulled into a distant, muffled blur — laughter folded into cicadas, plates clinking faintly like memory rather than sound.

The board sat between them on a low table. Black and white stones whispered as they moved, that dry ceramic hush that only Baduk makes — intimate, precise, unforgiving.

Lucky Dave leaned back in his folding chair until it creaked softly. One boot hooked under the table leg. A toothpick rested in the corner of his mouth, chewed to splinters and long past tasting like anything at all. He squinted at the position like he was trying to see through it instead of at it.

The board was tense. Not messy — tense. Cuts threaded through the center like stretched wires. Groups leaned on each other too closely, breathing borrowed liberties, every shape tight and uncompromising. Influence had been converted into pressure instead of space. Nothing felt allowed to relax.

After a long silence, Lucky Dave tilted his head slightly.

“You’re pressin’ too hard,” he said at last, tapping the wood rim of the board with one thick finger. The sound was soft, dull. “Every group you touch, you treat like it personally insulted you.”

Lily did not look up.

Her hand moved to the bowl, fingers precise and economical. She selected a stone without hesitation, her wrist steady as a compass needle. The stone landed cleanly — a firm attachment, surgical, almost severe.

Lucky Dave felt it in his teeth more than his eyes. The position tightened another notch, like someone pulling a cable just a little further.

He let out a slow breath through his nose.

“Don’t get me wrong,” he continued, shifting in the chair. The vinyl sighed under his weight. “It works. Hell, it works damn well. But it ain’t growth if all you’re doin’ is swingin’ harder every time.”

The fan clicked. Outside, someone laughed.

Lily’s gaze never left the grid. The lines of the board reflected faintly in her pupils, a quiet geometry of intersections and distances. Her posture remained perfectly aligned — back straight, shoulders loose, hands controlled. No visible tension. No visible response.

Yet the board told a different story. Sharpness. Refusal. A kind of compressed urgency pressed into every local fight.

She answered with a small move along the second line — a quiet slide, almost polite in shape. Contained. Conservative.

Lucky Dave snorted softly.

“There,” he said. “That’s you sayin’, ‘Yeah, yeah, I’ll fix it later.’ Same way you always do.”

The toothpick shifted as he spoke. He rolled it from one corner of his mouth to the other, eyes flicking between the board and Lily’s stillness.

A few moves passed.

The stones continued their soft, dry murmur across the grid. Black pressed. White resisted. The balance trembled delicately between collapse and control.

Lucky Dave leaned forward just slightly, resting his elbows on his knees. His voice dropped into the casual tone people use when mentioning the weather or a gas price sign.

“Oh,” he added, almost lazily. “And that boy finally made it. Hikaru. Just barely squeaked into the insei program. Probationary status. They’ll boot him if he can’t hold water.”

The fan rattled.

A distant shout from outside cut off abruptly.

The room felt suddenly narrower, as if the light bars across the board had edged closer together.

Lily’s hand hovered over the stone bowl.

Not frozen. Not shaking. Just… suspended. A fraction of a second longer than any normal selection required. Long enough to be visible only if someone was already paying attention.

Then her fingers closed around a stone.

The placement was flawless. Centered. Calm. The stone clicked into place with clean finality, as if nothing had entered the room except air and dust and sunlight.

Her face remained unchanged. Her breathing remained steady. Her eyes returned to scanning liberties and shape without any outward disruption.

Lucky Dave watched her from the corner of his eye, the toothpick stilled between his teeth.

A corner of his mouth lifted slightly — not quite a smile. Something closer to quiet confirmation.

“Don’t worry,” he said mildly. “Didn’t think you’d care.”

The fan kept turning.

The board kept whispering.

And the space between the stones felt just a little tighter than it had a moment before.",1,1768050040.0,Shinokiba_Chatgpt,0,1.0,False

1q93g3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1q93g3o/luke_tried_the_eggs_factory_guide_can_you_really/,Luke Tried The Eggs Factory Guide 🐔 Can You Really Build a Backyard Chicken Coop for Under $100?,"# 🥚 Introduction

Eggs aren't what they used to be. Prices are climbing, cartons feel lighter, and some of those pale supermarket yolks look like they gave up before they even began.

If you eat eggs regularly — or in my case, live with someone who does — you’ve probably stared into a fridge and thought, “There's got to be a better way.”

That’s where my friend Luke came in, fork in hand, muttering about **raising egg-laying chickens on a budget**. What started as a breakfast rant turned into plywood, hens, and a coop he built from scratch.

This review shares his experience using [The Eggs Factory](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official), a digital guide claiming to help users build a functional chicken coop for under $100. Spoiler: It’s more doable than you'd think.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name: The Eggs Factory**
* **Category: DIY & Home Projects → Backyard Chicken Coops**
* **Overall Verdict: 4.5/5**

# 📥 First Impressions & What’s Included

Once Luke hit purchase, the files were delivered instantly. No waiting, no shipping issues, just a well-organized folder and a **simple guide to backyard chicken coops**.

Inside the package was a detailed PDF, 3D diagrams, a parts list, and what Luke described as “cozy weekend vibes in document form.” It felt like a neighbor showing you how it's done.

Two bonuses sweetened the deal: a **Chicken Health Checklist** and an **organic chicken feed recipe book**. Both are helpful, especially if you’re new to **caring for backyard chickens day to day**.

The PDF is exactly what you’d want in an **affordable DIY chicken coop plan for beginners**. Nothing fancy, just direct, usable instructions that don’t assume you’re a woodshop teacher.

# 🧱 What Makes It Different

Plenty of “free” guides float around online, but most assume you either own a circular saw empire or can turn a pallet into a palace. Luke needed something simple and clear.

The Eggs Factory delivers a **basic chicken coop plan that produces daily eggs** without drama. The instructions are split into digestible steps, with diagrams that won’t make you squint.

The best part? He spent $93.74. Yes, we’re talking **how to build a chicken coop for** [less than $100](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official) with parts from the local hardware store — no scavenger hunts required.

This isn’t Pinterest fluff. It’s a **low-cost chicken coop design** that a regular person can build with a Saturday and maybe one trip to the store (two if you forget the hinges).

# 🔨 How It Actually Works

The guide is laid out clearly with a start-to-finish flow. Each section walks you through construction in plain language. Even if you’ve never built anything, you’ll get it.

Luke followed the **step-by-step guide to building his chicken coop** closely. He liked that it didn’t just dump measurements and disappear — it explained the *why*, not just the *what*.

By Sunday evening, the coop was standing tall. It was the perfect **beginner-friendly chicken coop setup for fresh eggs** — no frills, no fluff, just a clean build that worked.

The plan also makes it easy to adjust if needed. Want to scale up later? The structure is flexible, and you’ll already have the skills from **building your sub $100 DIY coop**.

# 🧑‍🌾 Personal Experience (via my egg-addicted friend)

Luke’s coop journey kicked off when he cracked a grocery store egg and said, “This smells like... absolutely nothing.” One week later, he had lumber in the trunk and [plans in hand](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official).

With zero woodworking background, he managed to pull off one of the most **simple chicken coop ideas for first-time builders** I’ve ever seen. I mean, I watched from a safe vegan distance, but still.

He appreciated the clarity. The diagrams weren’t abstract or confusing, and the measurements were spot-on. That’s rare in DIY plans, especially those sold for cheap.

His only gripe? The hinge diagram. It could’ve used a little more detail. But in fairness, he figured it out with a YouTube detour and some caffeine.

Now his coop holds three happy hens, and he’s collecting warm eggs each morning — the result of **starting a backyard egg farm the easy way**. I resisted going off on a vegan rant ... he's heard it all before!

# 🧍‍♂️ Who This Is (and Isn’t) For

This guide is ideal if you have limited outdoor space and basic tools. The **compact chicken coop design** fits snugly in small yards or side gardens.

It’s perfect if you're curious about **keeping egg-laying chickens in your backyard** but don’t want to throw thousands at a prefab structure that weighs more than your car.

Luke lives in the suburbs, has a modest plot, and didn’t want anything elaborate. For him, it was one of those **ideas for budget-conscious backyard chicken setups** that actually stuck.

This isn’t for you if you have no outdoor space, or if you’d rather pay someone to do the work. It’s DIY — just not the kind that ends in regret or plaster dust.

# 🌿 Bonus Tips for First-Time Chicken Owners

Before you buy, think about **choosing the best hens for egg production**. Buff Orpingtons, Rhode Island Reds, and ISA Browns are all known for being productive and chill.

If sustainability matters to you (as it does to Luke now that he’s converted), you’ll love that the coop promotes **sustainable tips for raising your own chickens** without constant waste.

Also, learning [how to get started](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official) **with backyard chickens** doesn’t require a degree in farming. All you need is a coop, a couple of hens, and a curious attitude. You’ll learn fast.

# ⭐ Star Ratings Breakdown

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ease of Use** Instructions are broken down clearly and don’t assume any prior DIY experience.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Clarity of Instructions** Mostly flawless, but the hinge installation could use a visual boost.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Affordability** True to the name, Luke built his for less than $100 — mission accomplished.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Bonus Materials** Helpful, especially the health checklist. Not essential, but appreciated.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **End Result Quality** The coop is practical, compact, and sturdy. No design awards, but no regrets either.

**Overall Rating: 4.5/5**

# ✅ Pros

🟢 **Affordable coop designs for new chicken owner**s  
🟢 Clear layout and **step-by-step chicken coop guid**e  
🟢 Great for **small-space chicken coop design**s in tight yards  
🟢 Works for those **raising chickens at home for fresh egg**s

# ❌ Cons

🔴 One diagram could be clearer (hello, hinges)  
🔴 Not ideal for renters or people without outdoor space  
🔴 Requires light tool use — not a problem for most, but worth noting

# 💵 Pricing Options

You’ll pay $39 for the full digital package, including the main guide and two bonuses. No subscriptions, no tricks, just a clean transaction and fast access.

If you want a **how-to guide for building a chicken coop cheaply at home**, this is one of the few options that stays honest about the price tag.

# 🛒 Where To Buy The Eggs Factory

Buy it only [through the official site](https://theworldhealth.org/eggs-factory-official). That’s the safest way to get the latest version and any updates. Plus, any satisfaction guarantees are only valid there.

We’ve seen a few sketchy duplicates floating around. If you're wondering **whether The Eggs Factory is actually legit**, stick with the source to avoid drama.

And yes, for those wondering if **The Eggs Factory is a scam or worth the money ...** Based on Luke’s experience, it's the latter.

# 🧾 Conclusion

The results of Luke's **real review of The Eggs Factory chicken coop guide** is this: straightforward, effective, and surprisingly rewarding.

He didn’t just build a coop. He found a rhythm — mornings with the hens, evenings cracking eggs with pride, and that quiet satisfaction of knowing he built it himself.

What does **the Eggs Factory guide actually include**? It includes confidence. Instructions. A sense of progress. And eggs. Lots of eggs.

# ❓ FAQ

About 6–8 hours, depending on your pace and coffee intake.

**Can I use scrap wood or recycled materials?**  
Yes, and the guide actually encourages creativity. Just follow the structure.

For reference I am going to add one of my pattern charts here (: is there something you would change to make this better for needlepoint?

Most of my patterns are for mini cross stitch projects for a 4 inch hoop. I’m considering updating the listings to include language about the patterns being usable for needlepoint but I don’t want to do so before doing some more due diligence!

 “Hey mom?” my voice croaked, shattering the prolonged silence.

 She hummed in response; her eyes fixated on her ‘masterpiece’.

“Why did you leave the puzzle unfinished?” I pressed on as my washed-blue eyes studied her unrefined activity laid proudly on the coffee table.

If it were that easy, every seller would be rolling in profits.

 But here’s the truth—customers don’t just buy products, they buy perceived value. If your brand doesn’t scream “I’m worth the extra cash,” shoppers will scroll right past you to the cheapest option.

Think about it. Would you pay top dollar for a no-name phone charger with a blurry product image and a vague description? Probably not.

 But if that same charger came in sleek, eco-friendly packaging with a trusted brand name, glowing reviews, and a product video that makes you feel like you need it—suddenly, it’s worth the premium.

Amazon shoppers aren’t afraid to spend more, but they need a reason to. Your job is to give them that reason. From killer branding and luxury-level customer service to smart pricing strategies and irresistible visuals, let’s break down how to turn your Amazon brand into one that customers are proud to pay extra for.

# How To Design Amazon Luxury Packaging For Premium Perception

# Extending the Luxury to the Unboxing Moment

Unboxing is a process or activity; it is not a single action or something that is done in an instant. Luxury brands design this experience to be unique, exclusive, and one worth conveying to others, in some way.

When a customer receives your product the sequence of opening should seem like a message which has been encoded and needs to be decoded to reveal some valuables.

# Unboxing or Unveiling of the Luxury 

* Blind Unfolding: The technique of unfolding layers increases tension. You may use tissue paper, ribbons, or inner compartments in carrying out the Western style of wiping the body.
* Sensory Stimuli: Use of soft texture touches like velvet-type materials or fabric for inner lining and incorporation of special scent that appeals to the luxury.
* Example: An Amazon retailer of luxury jewelry can pack its rings to be held in a velvet-type box with a small compartment. The outer box is of good quality and the logo is imprinted on its surface which when opened by a magnetic flap contains the jewelry lying in a black satin case. This curated experience of unboxing elevates the perception of the product to something more luxurious.

Luxury unboxing is more than something that can be presented and looked at; it is more of creating moments that elicit favorable impressions. This way, those customers who will receive the experience are most likely to share on the social media accounts making the brand more visible.

# Use Secure Yet Aesthetic Protective Elements

A luxury food packaging has to offer protection to the food it contains as well as be visually appealing. Normal bubbles or plastic pellets often dilute the feel; hence, luxury car brands achieve packing protection features that improve the aesthetics.

# Luxury Protective Packaging Alternatives

* Bring a velvet look, feel while also protecting from scratch.
* Foam inserts & shelving divider: Depending on specification, foam inserts will grip the items while the shelf divider will hold them in place.
* Luxury Tissue Paper: The product protects delicate things while adding an element of design to it.
* Drawer-Style Boxes : It is particularly useful in a box design since it provides an initial draw that reveals the product as well as protecting it.
* For instance, a perfume offered on Amazon could come in a hard shell black box with a soft suede feel on the inside and a molded foam base that fits perfectly the position of the perfume bottle. One main aspect is a thin covering of the shoe made of the tissue paper with the brand logo looking exquisite.

Consumers want to receive high-quality products in perfect condition before using them, or consuming them alongside their other services. Shielding also offers a premium seal, and you want to make sure they receive it in that manner, to build confidence in your brand.

# Implement Smart Packaging Features

It also becomes apparent that technology can play a role in creating luxury packaging that will also be captivating to customers. They embrace marketing concepts which enhance consumer relations with the particular type of packaging as a media.

# Innovative Smart Packaging Ideas

* QR Codes: Direct customers to exclusive content, such as a digital authenticity certificate or product guide.
* NFC (Near Field Communication) Tags: Provide an opportunity for this customer to place their phone on an object to get all related details about it.
* The last kind of solution for informing customers is Augmented Reality (AR): Utilize augmented realities to help the customer to visualize the product in use, in their context.
* Serial Number Authentication: Makes the product unique as customers will be able to conbrand the actuality of a particular product.
* For instance, a wine produced under a luxury brand that is sold on Amazon could have a QR code placed inside the box, which when scanners will take the client/ consumer to a page with a video of a wine taster explaining about the wine’s origin, taste profile and recommendable foods to ac brand the wine. This small touch elevates the customer experience beyond the product itself.

IT evolves luxury products making them even more luxurious with the experience of its consumers because of smart packaging.

# Maintain Consistency Across All Packaging Elements

Luxury branding thrives on consistency. Example: The choice of colors, materials to be used, position of the logo etc, should all correspond to the brand identity. Consistency of packaging means that each time a customer goes to buy a product in your line, he/she will identify it easily.

How to Maintain a Consistent Luxury Packaging Identity

* Use The Same Color Scheme: Repetition of color helps create brand differentiation.
* Ensure Consistency in Lettering: Well-admired script fonts, serifs, and simple typefaces are preferable for the branding of luxurious products.
* Keeping Material Standard: No matter it is rigid boxes, glass bottles or soft touch lamination; all types of packaging should be of superior quality.
* Logos should be well engraved, especially through the embossing foiling or printing and the logos should be evenly placed.
* For instance, a premium set of office accessories on Amazon can incorporate matte black rigid boxes for all its products with its branding done in silver foil and have a deep blue lining on the interior. Even when it comes to leather notebooks or a set of luxury writing instruments, the design identity of the packaging does not change.

Customers also have the notion that consistency equates to professionalism and hence they will give their trust to you. 

Some of the effects of using packaging that is consistent with a luxurious theme include; They increase brand believability since the packaging is considered as part of the overall brand image and also improves customer loyalty.

# Selling Limited Edition or Collectors Pack

Exclusivity increases perceived value. Hence, limited edition or collector’s packaging directly appeals to the luxury consumer’s deep-seated desire for scarcity and exclusivity of the product.

# Strategies for Limited Edition Luxury Packaging

* Holiday design and finishing: Using a holiday design layout The holiday theme and neat finishing date.
* String: As being named earlier this design uses a holiday as its layout and comes with premium finishing.
* Numbered Collector’s Editions: Add numbers to the minute releases of products.
* Hand made or Unique Artist Design: Boxes that come with a tailored artwork or embroidery.
* Gift Sets: Presenting every product line in an upmarket packaging hole for a group of small high end products.
* Example: Amazon sees it as an opportunity where a high-end chocolate brand nestled in the site could package some chocolates in a heart that has been hand painted with Valentine’s Day graphics accompanied by a hand silken box. It is not randomly made; each of the boxes is numbered and signed by the artist to give the feeling of opening a newly wrapped gift.

Luxury buyers love exclusivity. The added bonuses of an LEP \[limited-edition packaging\] will make consumers want to get their hands on your product for many reasons, not the least of which is that they are customers who appreciate and collect your brand.

# Incorporate Premium Printing Techniques

The process of luxury packaging is not only limited to achieve premium materials for the packaging but also the type of finishing that is put into use for the packaging material. This is so because premium printing methods give added texture, enhanced depth and a touch of luxury to the packaging. 

Other details help to enhance the first impressions and make the potential buyer conscious of a product’s value that was added to the final packing.

# Techniques That Enhance Luxury Packaging

Embossing and debossing: These elevate one or more sections making it appear more relief which adds depth to the packaging. Embossing gives depth to the design elements for example the logos or the pattern thereby making it look taller and feeling that is more physical. 

Debossing is the other technique where the design is actually pressed into the material which is less conspicuous than engraving. Both methods improve the packaging by adding a feeling of intensity and availability and making it more distinct.

# Screen Printing

Metallic in gold, other kinds of silver or other superior colors and glitters add an artificial feel to design. It is mostly applied for logos or borders, or any other detailing to provide a regal touch. 

Thus, the use of gold foil stamping on a matte black box for a luxury perfume brand is perfect because it conveys the message of exclusivity at first glance.

# Spot UV Coating

 This is a process of varnishing a selective segment of the picture, the popular areas like logos, brand emblems etc, can be coated in high-gloss finish while the rest of the surface remains in matte form. This is not only useful in developing contrast but also in giving the packaging that rich feel that people appreciate.

 A luxury skincare brand could use spot uv on the product name as it is quite different from the rest of the box that is matt finished.

Apart from being used in bookbinding, edge gilding is now being used in luxury packaging to give a sophisticated look to the packaging. This method involves the application of metallic foil to edges of rigid boxes thus giving a premium look. 

Industry leaders in haute jewelry would embrace this technique of work so as to make their packaging to have that added dignity.

* For instance, a high-end watch manufactured by a brand could come in a blue-black finish with the brand’s silver logo printed on it and it is being sold on Amazon. 

It may come in a texture that is rather close to that of velvet lodging an easier feel to the touch while using spot UV on the logo. Using textures, finishes and metallic accents would give the customer a feeling that unboxing a software ,packaged this way is something worthy of the price it’s sold at.

Luxury is all about the details, for that reason, an additional layer of elegance is introduced by the premium styles used in the printing part of the packaging. The more effort that is extended in these aspects the more customers are likely to give a perception of the product as being premium and unique.

# Add a Personalized Touch

Luxury is not simply taking into consideration how it looks but how it feels when it enters the customer arena. Actualization makes the customer feel that he or she is unique in a way, and this is why personalization makes any purchase special. 

This is especially vital in luxury goods where customers would want to be catered to and will not accept anything that is average.

# Ways to Personalize Luxury Packaging

Written notes: A short note of appreciation as “Thank you, \[Customer’s Name\]” has an emotive force that cements the position of the brand and the customer.

 This is perceived more so because while ordinary printed messages can easily be produced randomly, handwritten are special and time-consuming, therefore passing the sentiment of effort and appreciation. 

Some of the strategies that can be employed when using amazon for sales of luxury products are as follows: Writing a welcome note to the customer and including it in the packaging is appropriate.

* Custom Print – The use of a picture is possible and it adds another dimension of branding to the inside of the box. Small but beautiful phrases such as “Crafted with passion, just for you” placed on the inside of the lids of the packaging would make it more individualistic. Some brands also write some quotes, cherishing messages, or special slogans of their brand on the inner lid of the box.
* Trademark or Producer’s Mark: Products in the fair trade include homemade goods like leather articles, jewelries or skin-care products, which should bear the trademark or producer’s stamp. It adds realism and ensures that he has taken the pains to ensure each item is uniquely crafted. It makes the customers feel that they are acquiring something that was custom built just for them and thus they bond with the brand.
* Personalized Additional Products: Tissue paper, ribbon, or customized pouches that can be inserted to the package help to enhance individualism. For instance, a luxury watch brand may pack the watch along with a microfiber cloth that has the initials of the buyer engraved. Such subtleties as these are attributes that go a long way towards increasing the perceived value of the product.
* For instance, a premium quality leather products brand can place a card within the box that says, “Exclusive for you, \[Customer’s Name Kindly\].” Beside this, a soft velvet dust bag with the brand logo looks elegant and serves as a protecting bag. 

Such an approach tends to make the customers feel valued, thus enhancing their loyalty towards the specific brands they use.

Luxury packaging is considered as a story or even an experience that should brand the product and have its protective function. Customizations apply an enhanced level of creativity in creating an unboxing that will have a lasting impression of the brand on its customers and create room for referrals.

# Invest in Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Packaging

Such consumers today demand from luxury goods environmental responsibility thereby making environmentalism and sustainability inherent in luxury goods. Green packaging is no more an altruistic concept but a reality that offers organizational benefits and strategic edge. 

By incorporating environmentally friendly materials and concepts designed in their products, only proves the fact that these so called high end brands also care about quality alongside being responsible for the environment.

# Sustainable Luxury Packaging Options

* Rigid Recyclable Boxes: Generally, employing recyclable materials should not be a problem and luxury brands can continue to incorporate the high end feel into it. Recycled rigid boxes of premium quality are no less durable and do not look any less elegant compared to more standard premium boxes.
* Bamboo Containers: Bamboo is quite strong and renewable as compared to plastic and other woods. For fragments of luxury goods such as skincare products, perfumes, or gourmet foodstuff, they should embrace the use of bamboo in packaging as a mark of sustainability.
* Traditional inks are petroleum based, while soy inks do not have hazardous chemicals that are toxic to the environment. With catches, richness of hue and striking imagery, luxurious packages do not necessarily have to sacrifice major print quality for earth’s health.

Based on this, high-quality brands can make reusable rather than disposable baggage as well as beautifully attractive tote, wooden boxes or fabric cases. This type of packaging is preferable to customers because they can double serve as an additional item and customers are more likely to recall the brand.

* For instance, a quality organic tea available on the Amazon store could be packed in biodegradable tins and enclosed in a cardboard carton. A hemp ribbon around it enhances its appearance and leaves a good feeling towards the environment, which is in line with the brand. 

The integration of sustainability aspects in the design increases the luxurious image of the product and gives the buyer a rationale for the higher price.

# Choose High-Quality Packaging Materials

Thus, the quality of luxury packaging could be defined by the following elements: The choice of materials. Customers correlate the quality of packaging with the quality of the product, which is why it is necessary to choose the best quality materials for packaging that would stimulate the consumers’ desire to buy.

# Why Do Materials Matter?

It is quite a let off to buy a very expensive watch that arrives in a very poor quality cardboard box. This aspect alone would be enough to derogate the brand positioning strategy to a premium segment. 

It is rather bathed with dark colors, a stark difference from its Japanese counterpart, with a rigid black box that is matte, sealed with a magnetic clasp. The latter gives one feel that is associated with a higher quality and it’s worthy to bear the price.

# Best Materials for Luxury Packaging

* Rigid Boxes: They are undoubtedly formally principally used in packing jewelries, perfume, and gadgets.
* Textured: Makes the paper to have such qualities as being like linen or having a leather feel or velvet touch.
* Soft-touch lamination: It has an appealing silky feel on the surface of the box thus pleasing to the touch.
* Magnetic Closures: Enhances the aspect of unboxing and guarantees product security.

Bamboo, recycled rigid boxes, and biodegradable fillers signal the idea of Sustainable Luxury and appeals to the premium environmentally conscious buyers.

For instance, a diamond jewellery brand that sells blazers on Flipkart can go for the soft touch laminated rigid box with a custom molded tray. Inside it is nestled into a satin lined base which adds to the idea of the expensive product range the brand possesses.

Purchasing better quality material makes sure that the packaging also meets the customers’ expectations of a luxurious product, thus building reputation and creating an illusion of premium product quality.

# Use Elegant and Minimalist Design

Luxury brands know that it is about quality and not about quantity. First of all, a simple and clear look of the packaging is associated with professionalism, self-confidence and status, which is important for advertising expensive and elite products.

# What Makes Minimalism Luxurious?

* Pale whites, blacks, navy, beige, or soft any subtle pastel shades give it a plain and simple look.
* Prefer monotone designs over bright ones Employ embossed, foil stamped/written, or minuscule print fonts that contain the brands’ names.
* The reverse is also a significant aspect of the design as this will impart a cluttered appearance if some negative space is not left in the design layout.
* Standard simple seriffed, delicate scripts, or refinement, sans serif fonts make items look superior.

This is why the high-quality candle brand that sells their products on Amazon might use matte black box with gold foil text for branding. Within this is a receptacle for the candle that has engraved in elegant letters, “Handcrafted for Your Serenity.”

Due to the high-end target demographic for luxury products, such visuals should be subtle yet bold. The beauty of minimalism is that by implementing it to your packaging, it has the feel of high end as to require a high price tag.

# Leveraging Amazon Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) for Premium Positioning

Amazon Enhanced Brand Content (EBC), now called A+ Content, is a game-changer for premium brands looking to establish authority and attract discerning customers. 

Unlike standard product descriptions, EBC enables **Amazon FBA** sellers to showcase their brand’s story, highlight unique features, and create a luxurious shopping experience. 

# Craft a High-End Brand Story to Build Trust

Luxury brands are all about tradition, quality, and selectiveness. A brand customer is buying a luxury product not just for use – he or she is acquiring an experience, tradition, and status. This is why it becomes interesting to have a good and engaging brand narrative.

Amazon EBC provided an opportunity to tell the brand’s story, presenting the brand’s values, and, thus, supporting the idea behind the creation of the product. 

The information told in a compelling narrative helps to gain trust, establish interpersonal relations, and highlight your brand among the numerous similar offers.

* For example, an Amazon store selling expensive watches may use EBC to explain the Brand’s humble beginnings by showcasing the history of the brand’s establishment in 1912 in Switzerland, the intricacies of the movements in watches, and the effort that goes into developing each piece. 

Specifically, the use of high-quality pictures of artisans, as well as the words of other watchmakers who have worked with the brand, can guarantee brand credibility.

Besides tradition, fulge can highlight any values like, for instance, sustainability or authenticity in sourcing materials, technology advancement, or any other. 

* Probably, a luxury, organic skincare brand could emphasize that it uses only ethically sourced ingredients as well as share photos of how botanicals are processed and how the product is made.

These are just some of the points that can help create a brand story that will appeal to the target audience because, as it has already been said, personal branding is the main aspect in brand narrative. Expose potential buyers to your world without expressing yourself in terms of facts only. 

Let the buyers observe and touch and even try to understand the amount of exertion put in making a product. 

* A consumer electronics brand that sells luxury items is not only the story of its past, but also the process of gaining credibility. It is when customers feel empathy with the journey; then they are willing to pay a premium price to get your products because it is a quality product worth to be paid for.

# Use High-Quality Lifestyle and Product Images

Luxury is a visual experience. When the customers look for such brands they want to purchase the best brands that will be properly packaged. 

Amazon Enhanced Brand Content or EBC enables brands to get out from the confines of standard image carousel and let the customers enjoy [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) and good looking product images having higher resolution that make them experience a different world.

* Use an example of a luxury Italian leather bag brand. Rather than having dimensions of products, the brand could make use of EBC for featuring a model stepping out of a luxury car, holding the leather bag stylishly.

 Such visuals help convey the idea of private and glamorous immediately and help to establish the product as a premium one.

In high-end branding, reprises or an incentive have a significant role in close-up shots as well. The buyers of luxury products would want perfection in all aspects from a ‘perfectly stitched wallet made of leather, the finishing of a bezel studded with diamonds, or the feel of the cashmere scarf. 

Use of macro photography that depicts texture, skill, and exclusive material content ensures the customer has predefined expectation of the quality he or she is paying for.

Another important aspect is uniformity of styles of all [Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/) used for the same advertising campaign. Every picture must seem as though it has been produced in-house, as it should reflect the colors, lighting, and angles of the brand.

 Luxury brand to select those low light, low contrast, and plain background in order to not to distract from the product.

It is thus important to understand that the use of high quality lifestyle and product images are aimed at overcoming the gap between the online shopping experience and the high end physical store experience.

 It is for these reasons that when customers are presented with the ability to touch, look at and use their mind unto the product, they are able to positively relate the style of the product as ones of high quality or rarity and therefore bear the high price.

# Depict your Unique Selling Points by Use of Comparison Charts

Luxury buyers expect clear differentiation. They are not looking for a new product; they want to understand why your brand is more effective than the others.

 It is here that the brand under discussion – Amazon EBC – may make use of the comparison charts that provide a clear framework to highlight the so-called unique selling propositions (USPs).

The observation is true and since most consumers are cost sensitive, comparison charts can help premium brands to establish features and benefits that make them different.

 They do not make use of complex analyses to prove the superiority of their products, but rather make side-by-side comparisons with conventional products, so that even a lay customer will be able to understand it.

* For instance, an organization such as a manufacturer of expensive espresso machines should develop the following cross-tabulation table.

This project involves a comparison between a Premium Brass Water Boiler that gives higher accuracy on a temperature control front against our competitor’s mere Plastic Water Boiler.

* Hand-Assembled Internal Components vs. Mass-Produced Mechanisms
* Certified Organic Coffee Pods vs. Regular Commercial Coffee Pods

When grounded and transparent, all these aspects would help brands to get rid of hesitation as to why their product costs more and help to reinforce the perception of exclusivity.

Comparing and contrasting is another excellent application of the charts in that it helps in categorizing levels of products within the same line as premium. An example of this concept is that a luxury bedding organisation may compare its:

* Signature Egyptian Cotton Sheets (1000 Thread Count) vs. Standard Cotton Sheets (300 Thread Count)
* Hand-Finished Satin Piping vs. Basic Machine-Stitched Seams
* Hypoallergenic Natural Dyes vs. Synthetic Chemical Dyes

These elements make decision making easy on grounds of explaining why quality is profitable to invest on. 

If customers go to a store thinking that they have to use their hard earned money paying for a high-value product, they will not shy off when they have to part with their money to get what they wanted upon seeing it in a store.

Comparative tables shared on Amazon EBC do more than give knowledge to the consumer—it reinforces the brand to belong to the luxury segment.

 Customers understand that additional value is reflected in every aspect of it, so they have an assurance that they are making the right choice in taking up this service.

When we had our first sip, the coffee was cold and slightly bitter. But the moment? It was warm and sweet. We smiled at each other awkwardly.
When we stepped out of the shop, we both didn't know what to talk. I said that I'll walk her home. We started walking, our shoulders accidentally touched each other for a moment. It gave me butterflies.
We were talking random things along the way.We reached her home. It was a evening with mild sunlight. It was golden hour.

I'm looking for advice on how best to build wide floating shelves without creating bowing in the shelf. I would like them finished so no steel angles or brackets are visible, only the timber from the shelves. I would be ok with timber supports being visible. I do not want to split the shlf into two or three, I would like to keep them as one continuous shelf

I've bought a house and am renovating. The house is in Dublin, Ireland, built \~1954.

Around the chimney stack, I'd like to build floating shelves either side.

Both will be 380mm / 15"" deep (alcove depth).  
The wider shelves will be 1.6m / 63"" in length.  
The narrower shelf will be 1.05m / 42"" in length.

The ceiling height is standard, around 2.4m / 94.5"".  
My idea is to have a standard countertop height (900mm / 34.5"") with cupboards beneath. The countertop would carry the most weight - small practice guitar amps, records, record player, large hardback coffee table books etc.  
Then I'd have two or three shelves above those two countertops.   
  
There is solid block walls on all three sides, all block on flat. Not hollow blocks or CMUs.

Someone has suggested getting 4-sided steel hollow sections fabricated with fixing holes and lining them in timber.   
Someone else has suggested dowelling in rebar into the wall with a chemical anchor and sliding timber pieces into them. 

If anyone could help share ideas, experience and/or advice from similar designs / builds, we'd really appreciate it. 

My preferences are   
1) robustness (nothing falling on the cub)  
2) sleek design  
3) cost (nothing outrageous though)

You just describe what you want in any natural language—like 'Make a smart thermos that keeps coffee hot for 24 hours and tells me when it's ready' (or in Japanese, Spanish, whatever)—and the AI handles everything: designs it, simulates, checks safety, prototypes, tests, and even manufactures it.

AI is getting so good at understanding languages now, this could totally work soon.

Full concept here (English version on GitHub, but the idea supports any language!): [https://github.com/shiorimotono-del/Universal-AI-Factory](https://github.com/shiorimotono-del/Universal-AI-Factory?referrer=grok.com)

What do you think? Any issues with this? Would you actually use something like it?

1q92xyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1q92xyh/irrational_fear_that_my_body_will_change_after/,Irrational fear that my body will change after one day of overeating,"Hello all,

The title might be pretty self explanatory, but I feel the need to talk about this somewhere, and I figured this might be the right place.

I've been losing weight for about a year. I'm finally kind of content with how I look - I don't love my appearance, I want to be thinner. But I finally feel like I look okayish, even though I feel my worst and am clinically underweight. 

Today I woke up feeling an extreme hunger. Granted, it might not actually be extreme - just more intense than what I usually experience, or ""allow"" myself to feel. And, since today morning my weight was lower than I expected, I decided to allow myself to eat a little more today.

 I started my day with my ordinary ""safe"" breakfast and some coffee. Then, that wave of hunger hit me like a train, so I had some extra sweets - some bites of cake, some bites of panettone, half a cookie, 5 nachos. Nothing extreme, just more than I'd normally let myself have in unhealthy snacks. 

I really wanted to have a big dinner with my boyfriend outside today. I still want it, so so bad. And I really want to allow myself to do this for myself tonight - I'm at a weight where I could even maybe allow myself to gain a little bit of weight (emphasis on little, lol). 

However, I'm so scared of losing the small amount of confidence I had today when looking in the mirror -- I genuinely feel and fear that eating one big meal, on top of my many snacks today, could singlehandedly change the way my body looks, in a way that could be visible tomorrow (and I mean more than just bloating, like my legs being thicker and my whole body being chubbier).

This fear is driving me insane. I struggle to go even a single day without counting my calories. On the VERY rare occasions that I do, I feel an immense guilt that's almost debilitating... Until the next morning comes and I see that the increase on the scale is not that significant. 

I just wish I could have, like, ONE day every 50 days where I could eat more. I know objectively that a single day of overeating, within reason, is almost impossible to cause a visible change (other than bloating). But I can't help but feel like if I go out and eat a pizza today, I'm going to LOOK different tomorrow.

I don't know what my point is in saying all that.. I think I need reassurance that one or even two meals today can't ACTUALLY change the way I look.... right? Surely even if my weight increases it's mostly waterweight... idk guys, all these thoughts are becoming unbearable to me and i dont know what to do.",1,1768048376.0,EatingDisorders,0,1.0,False
1q92wr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1q92wr5/less_groups_or_communities_are_open_less_people/,"Less groups or communities are open, less people know and learn about them, and be accepting, and keep seeing them as ""other"". I think this is why there is big difference between gays and lesbians acceptance levels in society.","I see it as re-occurring theme, talked often how people see and respect gays and lesbians quite differently. Couple of my friends brought it up last week at dinner how different and ""unfair"" it is, as them being a lesbian couple.

I have gay-men as friends for a long time now, since I was 16 or so (I am 36). Recently I ended up being friends with married lesbian couple, which last week we had a dinner at our home (I am straight married man) and we had some long chats. This lead me to think what I am about to share.

Gay guys, as far as I can remember, were always very open. Despite having very, very harsh reactions from society, not just judgements but even physical beatings (at least where I grow up) you could always have any kind of chat with them, joke around, or ask around serious things about practically anything. They were both open and interested, at least the people I knew. But also media , tv shows, and my ""online"" experience supports that. There are many famous gay characters on TV, often in comedy shows (modern family, Will and Grace) and they are very much loved by everyone (who isnt just outright a bigot), they are portrait open and fun-loving, which almost no gay-men find problematic. There are countless gay-men subreddits even here and they are all open to anyone and everyone, anyone can ask or comment and unless the question is clearly evil, they actually take time and answer well. 

Now lesbian women however, completely opposite almost. I have spend over a decade dancing (social dance) which attract a lot of LGBT people (one of the reason I ended up knowing many gays guys also) and there were some lesbians there but, they were very closed. They were polite and said hi and bye and just went home. It was very rare that they would join social events like parties, and they had very little connection with other people in classes. Other people I knew who were lesbians were also always that, and stayed that ""someone I know, which I introduced myself, learned their name, and that is it."" They reserved themselves, did not engage or become friends with the other folks. I also learned last year, one of my colleagues (she) is also married to a woman (after working next room 4 years), but she is also very reserved, she often does not come to lunch with us or to company events. She is polite and helpful at work, dont get me wrong, she is nice in that way, but very...closed. Similarly, I learned one of our highschool friends (she) married a woman and I asked around if anyone has contact with her, and everyone said she kind of ""disappeared"" after like we were 22 years old or so. No connections left.  

So more I thought about it, more it became clear to me, I knew so few and so little. But it isnt that me wife or I did not take the step, it is way more they were far away. The couple we had dinner with is actually same way, when I think about it we knew one of them for a long time, about 3 years , she is colleague from my wife, but we did not actually become any friendlier until last couple of months, because they were never up for any social event, they were missing in every dinner or party we throw away, like birthdays, new years eve, dinner together at a restaurant etc. Only reason we actually become closer that we had dinner, was that they needed professional help in their property and I helped them for the price of ""a slice of cake and a coffee"".

The media and internet also supports this feeling of mine, there are very few comedic lesbian couples, and when there are any, they are often heavily critiqued by other lesbians. Very little insight is ""allowed"", almost. Subreddits are much ""worse"" as in I tried to look if I can ask questions related to this post in last days, and none of the subreddits by lesbians even allowed post of comment from anyone who isn't a lesbian. No way to interact, no way to converse, very, VERY closed.

I think this is one of the fundamental reason there is a big gap between acceptance, understanding and respect between gay man and women lesbians, from outside world. We just... dont know about them, because they are just so closed. There is very little exposure. 

To make an analogy, It is kind of like a spice that is so rare to find in any dish, so your palate is not used to them, what you know or you think you know about the spice is not accurate because simply you have never been exposed to it enough. It is always that thing left at the supermarket shelf and not a part of your daily cooking.",4,1768048263.0,SeriousConversation,10,0.75,False
1q92wgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/desifemfrag/comments/1q92wgl/frag_collection_of_somebody_who_has_just_started/,Frag collection of somebody who has just started,"See, I have recently started learning about fragrances, perfumes, notes, and my own preferences in this sphere but it all started with the blue and pink bottle you see in the picture. It is the Bvlgari Chill and Sole, difficult to get your hands on, part of their latest collection. I first smelt it at the Bangkok airport and fell in love, kept smelling the tester strip for days. That is when I realised I am into florals with a hint of citrus, maybe even a bit of powder and sometimes musk. Anyway here is how I feel about these perfumes most of which I have accumulated in the last month tbh (guilty).

1. Body Shop British Rose: Smells so very subtly of roses. I would imagine this is how a garden full of roses would smell like. Before I came across this smell, I hated rose anything and even after I bought my first bottle of this 2 years ago, I wasn't a fan but then, I let it sit on the shelf for a couple of months and I think it mascerated. One fine day I smelt it and felt exactly how I described it in the beginning. It stays on for 3-4 hrs, 6 hrs on a good day.
2. Body Shop Bergamot: Smells like gajra in a bottle. So very pleasant. Not the kind that makes you smell like an old lady with good hygiene, but something that makes you want to dance in the rain like Kajol from DDLJ. Not very long lasting though.
3. Moschino Funny: My boyfriend bought this for me, so I had no clue what it smelt like. This was my first ""expensive"" perfume. It is a very citrusy, fresh fragrance that settles into a sweet, subtle, but nuanced citrusy floral bouquet. Makes you smell like a badass bitch on an Italian summer vacay, with barely any fucks left to give. Lasts for 3-4 hrs, 6 hrs on a good day.
4. Skinn Celeste: This was my favourite fragrance at one point, until my nose came across the more nuanced smells. This now smells like mogre ka tel to me. No offence. Maybe it's just my nose. But I now mix it with other frags just so I can finish it. Lasts for a fairly long time.
5. Zara Red Temptations: This now reminds me of bad decisions; nothing wrong with the fragrance, just my wrongdoing. Anyway, this one is so very sweet, it makes me nauseous. Had bought it when I had no clue about fragrances and my preferences. It has hints of must and amber, too, but the sweetness just overpowers it all for me. Lasted a fairly good amount of time.
6. Studiowest Pisces: This one was a nice find. Surprisingly long-lasting. Smells like a not very expensive but 'the maker knows their stuff' kind of good. Mature floral and woody. Might smell nonenal, but I don't mind this particular one.
7. Burberry Weekend: The fragrantica site says it's predominantly floral, but to me it is more fresh, musky, and woody than floral. Powdery, yes, but not floral, once it settles down. This one was also gifted by my boyfriend, so I didn't know how it would smell. In fact, initially, I did not like it, but it grew on me. I maintain that this is how wise, single, pretty women in corporate smell like.
8. Bvlgari Chill & Sole: Burnt a hole in my pocket. This is where my love affair with fragrances started. This is where I began to discover the fraghead in me. I discovered I like floral and fresh frags more than others. This smells like walking into a flower shop with freshly picked mogras kept on the counter. Now, this kind of fragrance can very easily smell like the mogra tel, but not this one. It is much more nuanced (it better be, have you seen the price tag?). Fragrantica says it is predominantly citrus, followed by floral. I smell flowers of all sorts first, and somewhere down the line do I smell citrus faintly.
9. Lancome Idole: Saved the best for last. The moment I smelt this is the moment I knew this is the fragrance I would choose if I had the option to choose only one frag for the rest of my life. Oh, the life of deceit and deprivation I have lived, hating rose fragrance up until I found this bottle. Just roses, of all kinds, mixed skillfully by a fairy and put in a bottle.

PS: I recently tried Givenchy L'Interdit, and that is how a rich, successful, confident woman smells like I feel. That woman knows how she likes her coffee, and her men and nothing less suffices. Also, anything from Narciso Rodriguez is pretty much always good.

I look forward to hearing from you guys, your recommendations now that you have all of this information. Thanks for reading!

This year, I had one new entry into my top ten seasons and that is season 2 of The Offensive. While this year there were many contenders who got close, in the end, this is the one at the top. An absolutely great sports comedy/drama that will keep you entertained from episode one.

As always, I highly encourage everyone to support these creators financially if you're able to do so. Done with Stranger Things? Replace your Netflix subscription with Patreon for a month or two. Shopping for clothes? Buy a t-shirt from your favorite audio drama. Every cent counts and shows support for a mostly free medium which brings us all together.

In addition to the show creators, there are plenty of other amazing contributors in this community. I would like to highlight the amazing work that u/hitch42 and [u/evoterra](https://www.reddit.com/user/evoterra/) do. Their efforts in this community cannot be overstated so please also consider supporting them at [Audio Drama Directory](https://www.patreon.com/cw/audiodrama) and [The End](https://www.theend.fyi/support)

2. [90 Degrees South](https://90degreespodcast.com/) (season 3) u/90DegreesSouthPod

A super cozy listen with a whole lot of heart. The great quality of world building, characters and writing continues in the third season. This one has grown to become one of my all-time favorites.

3. [Academy](https://wondery.com/shows/academy/) (season 1) u/candersonook

I cannot believe how much emotions this teenage drama got out of me. Absolutely astonished how great writing can make you care for the characters and their relationships.

5. [Among the Stars and Bones](http://www.amongthestarsandbones.com/) (season 1)

A great scifi with good action, world building and mystery. Really enjoyed the first season and can’t wait to see what it has in for me in the future.

6. [Arden](https://www.ardenpodcast.com/) (season 2) [u/emilbeez](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilbeez/)

A show with a fun set-up and a great mystery. I really enjoy the character dynamics and the story had me invested and guessing what had happened from the first to the last episode.

7. [Book Fair](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/book-fair/id1709183921) (seasons 1-2) [u/CraftyJackrabbit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CraftyJackrabbit/)

The most deranged book club you’ll ever join! The humor in this show is absolutely wild. The fictional books and authors they come up with are pure insanity and I absolutely love it. Such a simple concept but done with incredible execution.

8. [Bunker 8](https://audiodrama.directory/bunker-8/) (season 1) u/deansmy

A creepy story set in an arctic research base? Count me in! I love the setting and the show comes up with plenty of creative horros to creep you out.

9. [Cabin Tales](https://www.thomashalle.com/cabin-tales) (season 1) u/Thomcruzes

A super intense horror anthology with a lot of great ideas. My favorite episode was episode 9 The Chosen One. A fantastic show to put on Halloween.

10. [Candy Claus Private Eye](https://audiodrama.directory/candy-claus-private-eye/) (season 1) u/hellakale

I just loved this show. It manages to build so many details into this insanely fun Christmas world. Has an absolutely hilarious sense of humor which left me wanting more.

Crazy humor which I was not prepared for. The set up is fun and I’m definitely curious to see what the later episodes bring with them.

13. [Dean’s Killer Joke](https://audiodrama.directory/deans-killer-joke/) (season 1) u/EvagationMedia

I really liked the mystery and the setting of this series. It brings up a lot of interesting discussions that have been had online and gives valid points from both sides. Good characters and a solid story.

14. [Deep Space Radio](https://www.deepspaceradiopodcast.com/) (seasons 1-7) u/DeepSpaceRadio1

A fun quick space adventure. The episodes are usually 2-3 minutes long which had me suspicious at first, but the episodes run together so smooth you barely notice the cuts. Now you can even enjoy whole seasons in a single episode format. A high recommendation for fans of EOS 10 and Star Trek!

15. [Desert Skies](https://desertskiespodcast.com/) (season 2) [u/Night\_Fabulous](https://www.reddit.com/user/Night_Fabulous/)

There aren’t many audio dramas out there that can pull such genuine emotions out of me like this one. Absolutely in love with the world, characters and storytelling. A must-listen to everyone.

16. [Divorce Ranch](https://goodstoryguild.co/listen/divorce-ranch) (season 1) u/queen_slug-4-a-butt

A western mystery with its own unique twist, that's easy to recommend. Super fun setting, great production and a colorful cast of characters.

Super fun setting and execution. Loved every episode and the jokes had me laughing out loud multiple times.

21. [Hannahpocalypse](https://redfathom.com/hannahpocalypse) (season 2) [u/VendettaViolent](https://www.reddit.com/user/VendettaViolent/)

The world of Hannahpocalypse expands with new characters and lore. The writing is as wonderful as the first season and I consider this a must listen to all AD fans.

A super interesting and creative worldbuilding with a ton of possibilities. Loved their take on a supernatural small town.

23. [Haunted: The Audio Drama](https://www.cyberpunkstudios.co.uk/haunted-radio) (season 1)

I loved this show. The energy it has is just incredible. The dialogue, story and of course the music are just absolutely perfect. Its one of the most fun rides you will take and I highly recommend it. Even months after finishing the show, I can’t help but hum the theme song when I get bored.

I highly encourage you to read everything because it offers a lot of context and insight into the work of Referees and especially their video assistants.

Around the turn of the year, there isn't much going on at the Center for School Quality and Teacher Training (ZSL) in Stuttgart, but Pascal Müller has reserved a room just in case. Müller, 35, works as a consultant at the ZSL, which is responsible for the training and further education of teachers in Baden-Württemberg, among other things, but he also has a second interesting job: For six years, the former second division referee has been sitting in the famous and sometimes notorious Cologne basement almost every weekend as a video assistant referee (VAR for short). Müller is considered one of the world's best specialists who, without a parallel career as a field referee, concentrate exclusively on their work in the VAR center. He has now made a name for himself throughout Europe and is also used as a VAR in the Champions League. So who better than Pascal Müller to answer all the pressing questions that the still controversial video referee has raised since its introduction in the 2017/18 season? A look into the basement.

**SZ: Mr. Müller, we're asking on behalf of Lukas Kwasniok: Is there a coffee machine in the Cologne basement?**

Pascal Müller: There is, but I can't comment on the quality. I'm not a coffee drinker.

**Lukas Kwasniok, coach of 1. FC Köln and avowed opponent of video evidence, suspects that the VAR was probably “drinking coffee” again instead of doing his job.**

I know *(smiles)*. What I can say is that at the moment we don't even have a lounge. When you come in, you're right in the second division room...

**...where the VARs for the second division games sit...**

...yes, and then there's a passageway with toilets, a cloakroom, and a coffee machine, and then you come to the Bundesliga room. We can't hang out anywhere except at our station. So: false accusation! There's simply no place to relax *(laughs)*. However, when we move to the DFB campus in Frankfurt for the 2027/28 season, it will certainly be more spacious.

**There is constant discussion about VAR, but for the audience it remains a phantom. Let's shed some light on the basement and try to understand the processes. Let's start with the basics: when do you find out that you're on duty in the basement at the weekend?**

Every Monday, when the referees are assigned. Then I find out by email whether I have no VAR assignments, one, or maybe even two for the following weekend. And then, in principle, the coordination with the respective referee begins. I always send my colleague a WhatsApp message: “Looking forward to the game, when shall we talk on the phone?”

**What exactly is there to discuss? You all know each other.**

But we don't work in fixed teams yet. I work with a different referee almost every weekend, so there's always something new to talk about: What happened last weekend, are there any new issues compared to last time?

**As a VAR, do you have to adapt to the respective referee, or does your working method always remain the same?**

No, it varies. Some referees only want advice according to protocol – in other words, I only intervene in VAR-relevant situations *(goals, penalties, red cards, player confusion/editor's note)*. I only report if I conclude from the images that my colleague has overlooked something relevant or perhaps made an incorrect assessment. Other colleagues, on the other hand, want to be reassured. They also want positive feedback during the game.

**So you're saying: That was a great yellow card just now?**

Something like that *(smiles)*. Let me give you an example: A colleague blows his whistle for a free kick on the wing, three players gather around him and loudly protest against the decision – and then a goal is scored following this free kick. In that case, it can help if I say: “Don't worry, the free kick was completely fine.” When we talk on the phone during the week, I always ask my colleagues specifically: “How would you like it this time – would you like feedback, or would you prefer me to keep quiet?”

**Felix Brych once said that referees study the teams' tactics just as conscientiously as coaches before games. Does that also apply to video referees?**

Of course, it's always helpful to know where to look, for example, which player always blocks the opposing goalkeeper. Nevertheless, this kind of game preparation is not quite as important to me as it is to a referee. I'll put it a bit bluntly, and you can decide whether you want to believe me or not.

**We're curious.**

The moment I watch a scene, I don't even know who's playing.

**Okay, we might not believe it when you put it that bluntly.**

But you know what I mean, right? When I'm checking, I'm completely in the zone and always asking myself the same questions: Who is doing what, who isn't doing what? And at the same time, my head is rattling through the checklist that's relevant for the scene in question. At that moment, I have zero awareness of who's wearing the red or blue jersey.

**Are you also observed and evaluated as a VAR?**

Yes, of course. Every Tuesday, we receive the observation sheet from the previous weekend. And anyone who messed up is likely to get a week off.

**Silly question: Who observes you in your gloomy basement without a break room?**

The evaluation comes from the referee observer in the stadium. For VAR, the criteria are “correct intervention,” “incorrect intervention,” or “missed intervention.” We always start with a score of 7 as standard, and every correct intervention earns one more point, up to 10. And for incorrect or missing interventions, one point is deducted, down to 4.

**So that means: one correct intervention – plus point! – and one incorrect intervention – minus point! – add up to seven again in the end?**

You might think so, but of course we have our own referee arithmetic *(laughs)*. Anyone who makes a mistake gets a six – and if they make a correct decision, an eight is added in brackets. Two mistakes result in a five, and any correct decisions are then no longer shown separately.

**Phew.**

As I said, referee arithmetic. But that's why it's actually best for a VAR when they get a seven: then you don't have to prove that a colleague made a mistake and you haven't done anything wrong yourself.

**Is it true that field referees get points deducted if they have to call on the VAR for help?**

Yes, for every VAR intervention that leads to a correction, there are deductions on the evaluation sheet. That's why it's so important to work as a team and be able to rely on each other.

**Interesting. But now back to the week.**

Where were we, on Tuesday?

**Correct.**

On Wednesday, our sports management sends us a playlist with five to seven scenes from the previous weekend, accompanied by notes and comments. So: That was good, or: We would have preferred it differently.

**That means you're actually a video referee all week long.**

Yes, but it goes further than that. There's also a tool from the European association UEFA called “perception for perfection,” or “P4P” for short. About once a month, 20 scenes are played on it, and you have to act like a VAR. I select a scene, the clip starts playing, I see the scene from different perspectives, and a ten-second bar runs down the side of the screen. Then I have to decide whether I would intervene.

**Is it like a regular theoretical driving test?**

I would say it's more like our way of warming up before the game, a stretching program for our perception muscles, so to speak. We are deliberately asked to put ourselves in the VAR process, under stress and time pressure. And every three weeks, we also have a one-hour online meeting where we discuss critical scenes. This also adds great value, because this meeting is all about the most important thing.

**And that would be?**

Consistency! The clear goal must be that at least 19 out of 20 colleagues have the same opinion on a scene. The guidelines from above are crucial here, and you can believe me when I say that everyone is aware of this and that we are working very consciously on achieving this consistency. For example, I would argue that coaches and players basically don't care whether an angled arm is considered a handball or not. It's about consistency. And in this respect, it wouldn't matter whether we base our interpretation of handball on that of the DFB or that of UEFA...

**...which is significantly stricter...**

... yes, but I am convinced that the tougher line would also be accepted. As long as the decisions are always consistent.

**In fact, one gets the feeling that the irritation surrounding handball has decreased somewhat. Nowadays, even a normal observer feels confident in judging a handball situation correctly 95 percent of the time.**

It's great that you see it that way, I would agree with that. But maybe the remaining five percent isn't due to a different interpretation of the rules, but to us. Maybe we just made a mistake in those moments.

**Nowadays, referees explain their decisions immediately afterwards over the stadium microphone. Has that proven effective? Often, the referee can only say half a sentence before the rest is drowned out by the cheers or boos of the crowd.**

The public announcement is intended to convey a sense of transparency, which is extremely important for the acceptance of VAR. For us, however, it means further coordination is needed.

**In what way?**

Before making an announcement in the stadium, the referee no longer has to activate his microphone himself; since this season, this has been done by the VAR assistant *(official title: Assistant Video Assistant Referee/AVAR, editor's note)*. Here in Cologne, we have a kind of button, and when the AVAR presses it, the referee hears “Announcement on” via his headset. This procedure also has to be discussed during the phone call during the week: some referees want us to count down “three, two, one, now” before we activate the stadium microphone in Cologne. For others, it's okay for us to activate it as soon as we've discussed what they're going to say.

**But isn't it true that any further complication harms the process? Because people want it to happen quickly above all else?**

Ideally, the referee runs out to the monitor, takes two quick looks, turns around and awards a penalty – then it's immediately accepted, along the lines of: “Ah, it seems there was a clear wrong decision.” But how often do we hear the phrase: “Yes, if the referee has to look at it for three minutes, how can his previous decision have been clearly wrong?”

**That's a question people actually ask themselves.**

I understand, but let's stick with the public announcement: There's a referee standing outside the screen with a pulse of 170 and he has to collect his thoughts first. Then he has to coordinate with us what exactly he's going to say and which player with which jersey number was offside, for example – of course, no one hears any of this, but it extends the process from maybe ten seconds to 30 or 40.

**So, in the end, the desire for transparency only increases the audience's discontent?**

That would be a gross exaggeration; I wouldn't put it that way. It's just important to me that people understand why the referee sometimes stands in front of the monitor for longer – not because a decision is unclear or because some sinister forces are at work with VAR.

**But the wording in the public announcement is clear, isn't it? Doesn't it always say: “After reviewing the images, etc...”?**

We recommend a kind of triad, but it's not mandatory. The first sentence is: “The following was reviewed...” Then comes: “After reviewing the images...” And finally: “Therefore, the final decision is...” But there are so many different circumstances that it's impossible to discuss everything in advance. And I have great respect for my fellow referees who stand in front of 60,000 spectators with their hearts racing, knowing that they have to get their sentences right so that they sound confident. And if I slip up once, I'll end up in the annual review.

**How much clarity is lost because you have to work with different teams in the basement? In addition to the AVAR, you have two frequently changing technicians at your side, known as operators, who are responsible for quickly selecting images.**

A lot depends on the operators. According to the protocol, they are the ones who present me with the images of the relevant scenes, and all I have to do is look at them. But of course, I can only evaluate a scene with the right image, and with 40 to 45 cameras, it's not always easy to find the right perspective in the heat of the moment. However, I now know the stadiums inside out, so I sometimes proactively request the appropriate camera.

**Let's be specific: The game starts, and at some point the first corner kick is taken. There's a scramble in the penalty area, and the referee can't see everything. Then the ball goes out of bounds, and the game threatens to continue with a throw-in. A correction would then no longer be possible. How do you proceed?**

Basically, as a video referee, I now have a good gut feeling. I would say I'm a gut video ref. When I watch the game live on the main camera, my live feeling is very often right. When someone falls in the penalty area, I have a clear first impression of whether it's a foul or not. I'm rarely wrong. The case described with the corner kick is a little more difficult, when what we internally call ping-pong happens...

**...when the ball comes down, everyone pokes at it, a hand goes up, one player goes down, another complains...**

...exactly, that's when we need the AVAR. Because while I, as the VAR, check the scene on my screen, the AVAR next to me continues to follow the game live on the main screen. Something else could happen. And if the scene is as described, i.e., if the game is about to resume quickly, then it is the AVAR's job to tell the referee on the field that he must interrupt the game.

**So that nothing slips through the cracks.**

So that the game doesn't continue while I'm still checking and realizing: Damn, that would have been a handball penalty. But it's too late now because the game is already back in progress. That's the most embarrassing thing that can happen. In the whole world. I would be mortified.

**And the broadcasting station would, of course, immediately show the relevant images.**

Everyone would have the images, and then there would be no more excuses. Then it would simply have been poor communication. That's why I'd rather stop the game ten times too often than once too little. But that brings us back to the familiar dilemma.

**Speed versus accuracy?**

Exactly. If I wave the game through quickly, there's a greater risk that two minutes later, the TV station will have found the right images, and then it starts all over again: Was the VAR drinking coffee? Eating cake? If television can prove a blatant error by the VAR with its images, it could be the end of my career. You have to find a middle ground. Checks that take too long destroy acceptance—but so does overlooking a game-deciding penalty kick.

**Does it actually help when players complain?**

It's a fine line. There's always one player who raises his arms, but when four people protest at the same time, it's usually a sign that you should check. But I'll also say this clearly: if no one raises their arms, I'll still check if I've seen something. I don't want to encourage players to complain. That doesn't get us anywhere.

**How high is the number of unreported cases or wrong decisions that we as spectators never hear about because television didn't notice them?**

Low, because nowadays, especially in the Bundesliga, everything is transparent. There's really no chance that anything will go unnoticed. And I can pretty much rule out the possibility of me not seeing an important scene after the game. That would be a damning indictment of me as a VAR.

**What many people probably don't know is that TV stations have a lot more operators who can quickly find the right images. That's actually unfair competition compared to you, isn't it?**

I was once in a broadcast van, and the TV director had seven operators. Seven! That would mean one operator has to keep an eye on three or four cameras. We have two operators for 40 cameras, which makes 20 per operator.

**This raises the question: isn't this saving money in the wrong place?**

Those are the facts. On the other hand, television rarely has camera angles that we haven't seen. The operators who work with us do a good job.

**Are all the operators also referees?**

Many, but not all. However, a great affinity for soccer is important; you can't really start from scratch in a VAR situation like this.

**Is the impression that the checks take longer than before misleading?**

I know that's the impression at the moment, but in Germany we're actually five seconds faster than the European average. The checks that take a particularly long time are very prominent in the media, but they can usually be explained. In some scenes, there are four things to check, three of which the media don't even see on the screen. Everyone focuses on a possible handball, and then they quickly say, “It's clearly not a handball!” But we saw that too, while also checking for fouls or offside. I don't want to sugarcoat anything, but there were maybe three scenes in the first half of the season where the check took too long – but in the end, the right decision was always made.

**One annoyance this season has been offside decisions, which have sometimes taken a very long time, even though semi-automatic offside technology (SAOT) has been in use since this year. First, an explanation: how does it work—and what is “semi-automatic” about it?**

First of all, it must be said that the system makes our lives much easier – and basically does everything on its own. In Germany, we work without a chip in the ball; ten additional cameras in the stadium track the ball and the players' body points. However, it is called “semi-automatic” because a human being has to “validate” the result...

**...in this case, the human being is the VAR...**

... yes, we check: Is the time of play set correctly by the system, does the system select the right players, the right body points, and so on. If everything works, it takes ten seconds.

**This leads to the conclusion that not everything always works. Referee chief Knut Kircher has just confirmed recurring problems with offside technology in Kicker magazine.** 

That's right, and if we can't be sure that all components are always correct, we have to check everything ourselves. That takes a little longer. And if a component is actually wrong, we revert to the old mode.

**You then have to resort to the famous “calibrated line” again.**

Exactly. And creating that manually takes up valuable seconds again. But to be clear: I don't want to go back to those days. I am convinced that the system will improve and that we will ultimately save a huge amount of time.

**Let's ask the fundamental question: Would soccer still be possible today without VAR? There are still calls for it to be abolished.**

As a VAR, I am naturally biased on this issue *(smiles)* and convinced of the value of our work. But I also believe that in this day and age, people would no longer accept blatant misjudgments if they can be prevented. In the age of smartphones, when every spectator in the stadium can stream the game live, why should the referee be kept artificially ignorant? Why should something like Thierry Henry's handball against Ireland in 2009 still be allowed *(a goal clearly set up by Henry's hand helped France qualify for the World Cup, editor's note)*? And what is often forgotten: We make far fewer wrong decisions than we used to. Far fewer! I think we are still struggling with the expectation that the introduction of video refereeing will lead to perfection.

**But let me ask again: when VAR was introduced, it was said that it would only intervene in cases of “clear and obvious mistakes.” At the time, it was said that if a referee needed more than 60 seconds to assess a situation, it could not be “clear and obvious” that it was wrong. That has not been the case.**

I would add: 60 seconds – if the referee has the right images available immediately. As described above, this is part of the review process, which perhaps not everyone was fully aware of at the time. And that is also the answer to the question of “clear and obvious.” A scene may correspond to the referee's perception from one camera angle and be clearly wrong from another. Plus, as mentioned above, there are often several things to check in a scene. I've been doing this job almost every week for six years – and I don't have the perfect solution either.

**Isn't that a frustrating statement?**

Knut Kircher's approach is that there should be fewer interventions in principle, so the intervention threshold should be raised. And we are now well on the way to achieving that.

**After everything you've said, wouldn't more operators for image selection be a long overdue step?**

I actually believe that more operators could help; more eyes see more. The faster the right images are available, the faster the decision.

**What about changing to the “challenge system” that has proven itself in other sports? That means coaches themselves can call on the VAR, once per half, for example?**

And what if all challenges have been used up in the 89th minute and a blatant mistake is made? As I said, I don't think anyone would accept that today. But of course, there's always the counterargument that, as VAR, I have to say that.

**As VAR, you have to say that.**

But if challenges were actually introduced, every club would probably hire a referee who would tell the coach or assistant coach by radio when to take the challenge. That would suddenly increase the number of my potential employers *(laughs)*.",10,1768047932.0,soccer,10,0.73,False

However, I find that I have a very dull headache in the morning before I take my medication.

Then when I take my medication within the hour it goes.

I take my medication at 11.30am as my day doesn't start until lunchtime so I've found there is no point taking it when I'm not doing much in the morning.

I drink 4 litres of water a day and the water I buy has some sodium in it and I don't drink coffee anymore.

I'll have a cup of matcha which contains 30mg of caffeine 4 hours before I take my medication and another one 6 hours after my medication and I've found this has no jittery effects on me or anything.

last week I didn't spend a lot of time in bed. I was working (from home) and went to see movies every day. Going to cinema is another thing I love. It started snowing last Sunday and it didn't stop until Wednesday. I was free last Tuesday and cooked delicious bean stew with sausages and threw snowballs from my balcony. Stews, another thing I love that make life better.

I was sober from January 1st, but yesterday after work I drank (a lot of) red wine and took some Xanax. I did this in bed, ofcourse. I won't drink today and I'm planning to stay sober for another 7 days, but I will definitely take remaining 1mg of Xanax later  today. Yesterday in the evening I also took some portraits of delivery driver who was from India. He was cool with it, I explained him that I'm a photographer and that I'm working on a surreal conceptual photographic diary which will be published as a book when it's finished.

Today is bed rotting day. No hangover from yesterday because I'm a professional. I will spend whole day in bed. I just made a big cup of hot coffee. Not the instant kind, despite the fact there are some cheap random instant coffee brands that I love. I made it turkish style from ground coffee. I might read today. And drink more coffee. Strong, black coffee. Yesterday I drunkenly ordered a lot of those triangle shaped gas station sandwiches, hence the Indian. Brand sold in my country is delicious. Another thing I'm passionate about.   

Window in my bedroom is wide open and cold air is caressing parts of my body that aren't under a duvet. I'm completely naked. Sounds of people showeling snow, birds, cars and an airplane are coming from outside and Sun is peeking through clouds. I had a very refreshing cold shower before I made coffee and I'm planning on taking a couple more hot and cold showers today. Currently it's 1:38 p.m.

Tomorrow I might meet my best friend. We went to cinema together on Thursday and my girlfriend couldn't come with us because she had diarrhea.",2,1768047592.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1q92p0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q92p0e/i_cant_get_over_my_first_love/,I can't get over my first love,"I wanted to post this for a while because I can't tell anyone in real life. I know I will get a lot of hate for what I'm about to say but I can't handle keeping it inside anymore.

I (F26) dated my first love when I was 16 for a year. It was a crazy ""puppy love"" kinda thing. Very intense, we argued but we were also making out for 3 hours. The classic first love dynamic. Too young to have a stable relationship but the feelings were real. We ended things because I've caught him texting a girl and we tried to make it work after that but we were both so immature I told him after a few months I don't want to do it anymore. So after a bit more than a year it was over.

Right after it we both got in new relationships, they lasted a few years. He would text me every once in a while (like once a year) and we would text for a few weeks (hiding it from our partners). No nudes or anything but there was some flirting and stuff. Our attraction is undeniable. But in our fashion we would always then get into an argument and stop talking for a year until he texted again.

Fast forward to now. We both have ""new"" partners. He's been with his girlfriend for 2 years and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5. I love my boyfriend and I want to build a future with him. We are on the same level on almost everything. Today I went shopping for some clothes and I saw my ex with his girl and I've never seen her before. I haven't seen him in more than a year. We all just said hi. My heart started racing and I was sweating. Now I came home and my heart feels so heavy...

I've never cheated on my bf with my ex. But he has texted me since I've been with him but it was just a bit before he got into this relationship. He was all flirty, we had coffee without my bf knowing (i know it's bad) and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted me but I went home. The thing is that it can't work between us.  I know this sounds bad but there is a huge intellectual gap (think I'm doing PhD and he barely finished high school). He has a really good job with good salary so it's not about the money. It's just we don't have much to talk about. It didn't bother me when I was 16 but it would now. 

So I know that it wouldn't work. I'm happy with my bf. Why can't I stop thinking about him? Why do I feel so bad now that I saw him with his gf? I feel like i will never be as attracted to anyone as I was to him when I was 16, full of hormones and not a single care in the world. I admit I'm still attracted to him but fully aware it wouldn't work. In a weird way just knowing he wants me makes me feel so good. Like whenever he would text me before and I would see he still wants me... I would feel so confident and empowered. Now I think he's really serious about this new girl. And I want him to be happy. But I'm dreading the day I find out he proposed. I don't want to marry him. But I don't want him to forget me. 

I don't know what I'm asking. I don't know why I'm writting this. I just know I can't say it out loud. Does anyone ever really get over their first love? Is it normal that the attraction is still there? I don't know if it is normal for me to feel this way. Thank you for reading. I know it doesn't make much sense. But just writing it down some of the weight from my heart is lifting.",1,1768047558.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
