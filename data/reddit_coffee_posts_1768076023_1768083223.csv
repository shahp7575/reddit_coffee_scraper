1q9hdcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1q9hdcy/vyvanse_works_much_better_than_adderall/,Vyvanse works MUCH better than Adderall?,"can anyone explain to me why vyvanse is a **LOT** more noticeable in its effects than adderall with my body at similar dosages? (i avoid any and all acidic or vitamin c containing things/ very ph neutral diet) is it possible i cant metabolize adderall efficiently as opposed to vyvanse which my body can absorb a lot better? or maybe i have a gene mutation which doesnt allow the absorption of certain things in my stomach? this may be a bit of a reach but i even once ate 5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms and felt nothing (same with 2 grams of different batches from different growers while all my friends had very intense visual and emotional experiences) 

it makes no sense to me how the more bioavailable and “stronger” adderall doesn’t come close to the effects of vyvanse. it just makes no sense to me adderall (name brand) doesn’t hardly help me at all in contrast to vyvanse which completely obliterates my inattentive problems and feels like the much stronger med to me. i’ve tried both starting from 0 tolerance and can without a doubt say my body just doesn’t know what to do with adderall. and i eat a VERY strict diet that excludes any and all acidic or vitamin c containing foods until 3 hours before sleep. no citric acid, no malic acid, no candy or snacks or alcohol, no tea or coffee. i workout every other day, i’ve eliminated every possible interaction i can find.. 

so for the love of all that is holy, can anyone tell me why vyvanse feels like the stronger and more powerful medication? everything i read and see online says adderall will hit harder and faster but but it’s the opposite, it hardly hits and it doesn’t make much of a shift in my focus or energy.

1q9hbcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/lactoseintolerant/comments/1q9hbcq/i_seem_to_no_longer_be_lactose_intolerant/,I seem to no longer be lactose intolerant (possible induced lactose tolerance?),"I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lactoseintolerant/comments/1q789eg/i_found_a_cure_that_works_for_my_lactose/) post and thought I'd share too, perhaps it might help someone.

I've been lactose intolerant for about 20 years now, and probably more intolerant than a lot of people here.  To eat mac and cheese I'd need about 10-12 Lactaids (split among the meal), or else I'd start to get stomach pains after the first few bites. I switched to the Andrew Lessmans because it was nice to have to take only 3 pills instead of 10. 

In September, I got sick and was put on 10 days of Amoxicillin. After I was done, I could tell my gut microbiome was not the same because suddenly there were a lot off things I couldn't eat or drink (like coffee) without getting an upset stomach. I thought I'd help rebuild it by eating a lot of probiotic/fermented food. So I went to my local organic grocery store and got some kimchi, kombucha and some yogurt that was made locally. I also got some natto from the Japanese grocery store. 

I ate a bit of the kimchi, but it was far too salty (I have hypertension) so I didn't finish the whole jar. I didn't mind the taste of the natto but it was more a sensory issue, so I only had half a container. What I did continue to eat/drink was the yogurt and kombucha (Health Ade, Kevita and Synergy brands). I would have some of the kombucha and a spoonful of the yogurt every morning for about two weeks. 

Before I got sick, I had watched [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/h90rEkbx95w?si=_d5K4P4Y7zbdQs2x) about induced lactose tolerance and thought I'd give it a try with my fresh new gut bacteria. I started eating a small amount of dairy every day, while going down to a spoonful of the yogurt once a week (truthfully, I was afraid to do what the youtuber did and go full dairy). From November, I stopped eating the yogurt and continued eating the dairy. Since then I've had countless amounts of milk (regular, condensed, evaporated, even a spoonful of straight milk powder), ice cream, macaroni and cheese, regular eggnog, sandwiches full of cheese, whipped cream and finally over New Year's I had TWO slices of pizza. Usually I'd be doubled over in pain from eating that, but I was fine. 

The only time I had a problem was over Thanksgiving I had some Lactaid ice cream. Strangely, this seemed to ""remove"" the tolerance, because the next day I had a stomach pains when I ate my daily dairy. So I took a spoonful of the yogurt and my tolerance came back. I now avoid Lactaid (even though the both Lactaid ice cream and eggnog are my favorites).

I suspect the local-made yogurt helped, because I used to eat yogurt and kefir all the time and was still lactose intolerant. Unfortunately, there isn't any information about the bacteria in the yogurt on the label. It says it's Greek yogurt, but it tastes unlike any Greek yogurt I've had. It's incredibly thick, like a pudding texture, and it tastes really fatty, like it was made with the cream on the top of non-homogenized milk. It's not as tart either. It basically tastes like eating mildly tart and fizzy cream.

I don't know if I'm completely cured, or if it's temporary, but I'm taking full advantage of it.",1,1768083031.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

I wake up in the morning and routine things just don't feel engaging at all, I don't feel alive, I have an aversion to doing and starting things and I feel tired overral. It can change if there's something exciting but in day to day life this is common for me. The only thing that helps is caffeine (I drink coffee or tea) but the issue with caffeine is that it's a stimulant, I build tolerance to it, and I need to redose it multiple times during the day. But it does make me feel somewhat engaged, much less fatigued and in a better mood.

Now, I have moderate to severe ADHD and this issue likely stems from it. Coffee only works for motivation, energy and mood, not as much for attention, impulsivity etc. I have tried methylphenidate and it helps with this issue somewhat but worse than coffee but it gave me much better ADHD symptoms overall compared to coffee. Now I take amphetamine (Vyvanse) and it helps both with motivation, energy and mood just like coffee but in a more sustained manner on top of providing good overall ADHD symptom control. And unlike coffee I don't build a tolerance to it. 

I don't take Vyvanse on the weekends though, which leaves me in this fatigued, low motivation state unless i take caffeine (which I avoid with Vyvanse or limit it to very small amounts). This sucks. And it isn't stimulant withdrawal because I was exactly like this prior to ADHD meds and I've cut out caffeine completely long-term several times and it didn't help 

Is there an antidepressant or another psychiatric med that would help with this issue? I know a lot of you are thinking bupropion but I can't take it with amphetamines. So most likely something that is activating without being a stimulant-like medication, idk if that exists at all.

TLDR: low motivation, interest in things and energy, diagnosed ADHD, only caffeine and Vyvanse help but I don't want to take caffeine because I get used to it and I don't take Vyvanse all the time (I am med free on the weekends). I've always been like this, even before ADHD meds and fully caffeine free. Would like to know if there's a med that can help with this that isn't a stimulant-like medication such as bupropion.

I was planning on meeting my friend just after lunch at a coffee shop at Canary Wharf. I was kind of in a rush so I wasn’t paying the most attention in general (and I’ve also had a really shitty few weeks recently, which might’ve added to my lack of general clarity). 

Out of nowhere, a person of Caucasian ethnicity approached me. He was about 5’8 with curly light brown hair, slim/medium build. He described himself as Irish of background, and that he had lost his backpack on the train/tube whilst travelling. He had only his phone on him and he stressed that he needed some money to stay the night at some hotel. 

Normally I would’ve rushed past someone like this and pretended that I was busy, but I thought I could spare the moment today and at least hear this person out. Looking back, the signs were there, since his first words were “Hey man, I’m not trying to ask for your money or steal anything” but then proceeded to ask me for financial help. 

Nevertheless, I started to feel empathetic as he was honestly very convincing, and he persuaded me to go to a nearby ATM to withdraw money for him in cash, after he promised he would send over a bank transaction. He proceeded to immediately open up an app under the name “Bank of Ireland” and asks me to type in my bank transfer details. It all looked extremely legitimate as all the required details were there, and I didn’t even stop for a moment to question whether this was a fake app. 

The next part was also extremely sketchy. He never asked for an amount of money to be transferred; instead he just typed in €1100 into the app and showed me a confirmation of this transfer. I bought into this as I thought it was real, and even though I checked my own bank account to see if this was legitimate, he showed me a pop-up message saying that this transition “would sometimes take up to 24 hours to show up”; so I trusted him. 

Of course, being stupid, I did exactly as he asked: I withdraw £500 in cash for him, plus another £400 that I had on me. I blame myself a lot for this part, since 99% of the time I never bring my wallet out with me, and it JUST SO HAPPENS that I brought it with me today. It felt like the universe just aligned everything for this scam to happen. 

In the end, as I handed him the wad of cash, he showed me that he had sent over a screenshot of the transaction confirmation to me over Whatsapp. I saw that I got it, and I wished him good luck and we parted ways. Suddenly I just felt like something wrong had happened, and just as I was checking his Whatsapp messages, I saw that he had deleted all his messages and blocked me. It then dawned on me that, instead of helping a stranger in good faith, I had just lost £900 to someone. 

Needless to say, I ran to my friend for help and we tried to call the bank as well as to file a report to the police. Both parties mentioned that, because it was a cash transaction, and that I had willingly given him the money, it is most likely not recoverable. The bank said they will review this scam case and follow up, and the police said they can only circulate the details and hopefully prevent another case from happening to someone. 

Now as I sit at home feeling miserable and puffy-eyed from crying on the Lizzy line, I sincerely hope that you guys will always take a moment to pause when these situations happen, and to feel whether your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong. There were moments when I knew in the back of my mind that something was super fishy, but instead I thought I was doing something good by helping out and feeling sorry for someone. 

Please don’t fall for this!! I’d love to hear how everyone would cope in a situation like this. Even though I could earn back £900, I just feel extremely defeated and annoyed at myself. ",0,1768082736.0,Scams,1,0.5,False

**A single mother, a young teacher, and a city that watches—Mangalore Buns is a story about love that arrives at the wrong time, in the wrong way, and asks what we owe ourselves versus those who depend on us.**

I have the entire story, just putting one chapter and the concept out there to start with.

**Chapter 1: No sunshine in September**

September in Bangalore was deceptive. The sun softened, the trees turned theatrical shades of orange and brown, and afternoons invited indulgence—naps, second coffees, lingering silences. It was the kind of weather that made people kinder to themselves.

Dharma did not feel kind to himself at all.

He wore a gray vest and navy trousers and sat at a small wooden desk inside a classroom that smelled faintly of chalk and floor cleaner, waiting for parents to arrive. Outside, the corridor buzzed with muffled conversations, shuffling feet, and the occasional reprimand from a nun reminding someone to lower their voice.

Parent-Teacher Meetings before Diwali were notorious. Expectations ran high. Anxiety ran higher. Every parent wanted reassurance that their child would emerge victorious after the festival—unscathed by sweets, relatives, or distraction.

Dharma glanced at the neatly stacked report cards in front of him and took a deep breath.

This was his second year at St. Agnes Convent School, one of the more prominent schools in the city. He was twenty-six, taught Chemistry to students from grades eight to ten, and was still considered new, no matter how many months passed.

He liked the job. He liked that the school was reputable, that it came with free transportation, subsidised meals at the canteen, and the quiet pride of telling people where he worked. He liked that he hadn’t had to start his career at a lesser-known institution where ambition went unnoticed.

What he didn’t like was being young.

The senior teachers treated him with indulgent impatience. His ideas were dismissed gently, like suggestions from someone who would eventually grow out of his enthusiasm. The Head of the Chemistry Department reminded him often to “temper” his methods, to be less experimental, less eager.

But his students—his students made it worth it.

They told him about PlayStation games he didn’t understand and Netflix shows he pretended not to watch. They complained about equations but secretly liked it when he explained reactions as stories instead of formulas. When a student showed even mild curiosity about Chemistry, Dharma felt a flicker of validation, proof that his presence mattered.

One by one, parents filed in.

There were the familiar types.

The perpetually dissatisfied ones, whose children ranked in the top ten percent but somehow still weren’t enough. The socially ambitious ones, who wanted their children to befriend only “good influences.” The embarrassed ones, who avoided eye contact because their child was struggling. And finally, the universal solution-seekers—parents who believed tuition classes could fix anything.

Three hours passed.

Coffee cups accumulated.

Voices rose, softened, repeated themselves.

By the time the last mother left—after telling Dharma that her daughter enjoyed life *too much*—he felt drained.

“She will pass,” the woman had said dismissively. “She’s too busy enjoying life.”

Dharma smiled politely and handed her a tissue when her daughter began to cry.

“Don’t worry, Madam,” he said aloud. “Anju will do well.”

What he didn’t say was that Anju’s idea of enjoying life involved music and art, things her mother had never learned to value.

When the classroom finally emptied, Dharma exhaled and leaned back in his chair.

Then he noticed Yogi.

The boy sat quietly at the back of the classroom, swinging his legs, backpack still on. He hadn’t complained. He hadn’t asked questions. He was waiting.

Dharma checked the time.

*She’s late.*

Just as he considered packing up, the classroom door burst open.

“I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry—”

Ambika Bhat entered like a gust of wind.

She wore a lavender shirt dotted with yellow sunflowers, small gold hoops glinting against her ears. She was slightly breathless, her curls framing her face in soft disarray. Her presence filled the room effortlessly.

“I got stuck on Outer Ring Road,” she continued. “It was chaos.”

“It’s alright,” Dharma said quickly. “Please.”

She smiled apologetically and sat down, immediately reaching for Yogi’s report card.

Dharma noticed, unnecessarily, that lavender looked beautiful on her. He disliked the colour generally. Greys and blues were his preference.

*Did she do something different with her hair?* he wondered.

“I’ve already gone through his grades online,” Ambika said, scanning the paper. “I wanted to have a discussion.”

They talked through Yogi’s weaknesses carefully. Dharma explained patterns, attention lapses, small improvements. When he offered to take exclusive tuition for Yogi, he meant it genuinely.

“That won’t be necessary,” Ambika said gently. “I’ve almost finalised a private tutor. He can cover Math and Science. He's got a Master’s degree and experience in an international school.”

Dharma felt something tighten.

“This isn’t about what happened in the past,” he said, trying to sound calm. “Yogi is bright. I’ve spent enough time with him to know how he learns.”

“I didn’t question your intentions,” she replied. “I just think this is best for him.”

“Private tutors are expensive,” he said, noticing the way her foot tapped nervously against the table.

“I’ll manage,” she said. “Let’s review after the mock exams.”

The conversation ended neatly. There was more to say but nobody said it.

She left quickly, her perfume lingering behind...familiar, unsettling.

Dharma sat there longer than necessary inhaling it.

1q9h25a,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1q9h25a/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

They were small, white, digital, rectangular, and easily portable. I think they had a clip or magnets since I remember attaching to our aprons. 

Those were true work horses, and can definitely take a beating. I’m trying to get some for my home kitchen and I’m wondering what the brand is and where I can buy?",1,1768082427.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False
1q9gzh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1q9gzh9/inperson_money_fraud_in_canary_wharf/,In-person Money Fraud in Canary Wharf,"Hey everyone, I’ve never posted on here before, but this happened to me earlier today and I wanted to share my experience with you in case someone else falls victim to the same scammer. 

I was planning on meeting my friend just after lunch at a coffee shop at Canary Wharf. I was kind of in a rush so I wasn’t paying the most attention in general (and I’ve also had a really shitty few weeks recently, which might’ve added to my lack of general clarity). 

Out of nowhere, a person of Caucasian ethnicity approached me. He was about 5’8 with curly light brown hair, slim/medium build. He described himself as Irish of background, and that he had lost his backpack on the train/tube whilst travelling. He had only his phone on him and he stressed that he needed some money to stay the night at some hotel. 

Normally I would’ve rushed past someone like this and pretended that I was busy, but I thought I could spare the moment today and at least hear this person out. Looking back, the signs were there, since his first words were “Hey man, I’m not trying to ask for your money or steal anything” but then proceeded to ask me for financial help. 

Nevertheless, I started to feel empathetic as he was honestly very convincing, and he persuaded me to go to a nearby ATM to withdraw money for him in cash, after he promised he would send over a bank transaction. He proceeded to immediately open up an app under the name “Bank of Ireland” and asks me to type in my bank transfer details. It all looked extremely legitimate as all the required details were there, and I didn’t even stop for a moment to question whether this was a fake app. 

The next part was also extremely sketchy. He never asked for an amount of money to be transferred; instead he just typed in €1100 into the app and showed me a confirmation of this transfer. I bought into this as I thought it was real, and even though I checked my own bank account to see if this was legitimate, he showed me a pop-up message saying that this transition “would sometimes take up to 24 hours to show up”; so I trusted him. 

Of course, being stupid, I did exactly as he asked: I withdraw £500 in cash for him, plus another £400 that I had on me. I blame myself a lot for this part, since 99% of the time I never bring my wallet out with me, and it JUST SO HAPPENS that I brought it with me today. It felt like the universe just aligned everything for this scam to happen. 

In the end, as I handed him the wad of cash, he showed me that he had sent over a screenshot of the transaction confirmation to me over Whatsapp. I saw that I got it, and I wished him good luck and we parted ways. Suddenly I just felt like something wrong had happened, and just as I was checking his Whatsapp messages, I saw that he had deleted all his messages and blocked me. It then dawned on me that, instead of helping a stranger in good faith, I had just lost £900 to someone. 

Needless to say, I ran to my friend for help and we tried to call the bank as well as to file a report to the police. Both parties mentioned that, because it was a cash transaction, and that I had willingly given him the money, it is most likely not recoverable. The bank said they will review this scam case and follow up, and the police said they can only circulate the details and hopefully prevent another case from happening to someone. 

Now as I sit at home feeling miserable and puffy-eyed from crying on the Lizzy line, I sincerely hope that you guys will always take a moment to pause when these situations happen, and to feel whether your gut instinct is telling you something is wrong. There were moments when I knew in the back of my mind that something was super fishy, but instead I thought I was doing something good by helping out and feeling sorry for someone. 

Please don’t fall for this!! I’d love to hear how everyone would cope in a situation like this. Ever though I could earn back £900, I just feel extremely defeated and annoyed at myself. ",5,1768082260.0,london,9,0.65,False

The timing results have been pretty poor and by the time I can drink the coffee it's lukewarm. Does anyone else use this filter with their pour over setup and experience long brew times or am I doing something way off? I generally make 1.5 cups at a given time.

Using the 1Zpresso K-Ultra on 8 with 1:16 ratio beans to water, I do the following:  
  
1) Wet the filter (yes I clean it regularly)  
2) 30 second bloom  
3) Pour half of the water in a slow circular even motion  
4) Wait until I can re-pour, usually around 2 mins

I'm pretty sure my ratio and grain size are fine, I've experimented with different grind sizes from 7.5 to 9 and they basically all surpass the 15+ minute mark.

When I was buying pre-ground coffee, I noticed it looked sludgey and obviously was clogging the filter. Using the K-Ultra, I'm not seeing sludge anymore which is a plus, but the brew time is still horrible.",1,1768082258.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1q9gyc8,https://youtu.be/JhFR-UqCZGk,4 Very Scary TRUE Isolated Camping Trip Horror Stories,"# “HUNTED AFTER”:

We picked this spot way out in the national forest, miles from any road or other people. It was just us, our tent, a small fire pit, and packs full of food and gear. We hiked in during the day, set everything up, and spent the afternoon fishing in a nearby stream. Caught a couple small ones, laughed about old times from college.

As it got dark, we built a fire and cooked some hot dogs. Alex was telling me about his new job, how stressful it was. ""Man, I needed this break,"" he said, poking at the flames with a stick. ""No phones, no bosses, just quiet."" I nodded, feeling the same. We ate, shared a few beers from the cooler we'd lugged in, and talked more. About girls we'd dated, stupid stuff we'd done as kids. It felt good, relaxing.

Later, after the fire died down to embers, we crawled into the tent. Alex zipped up the door, and we settled into our sleeping bags. ""Night, dude,"" he muttered. ""Yeah, sleep well,"" I replied. It was pitch black inside, but I could hear him breathing soon enough, already out. I lay there a bit, listening to the usual sounds outside—crickets, leaves rustling. Then, something different. A low hum, like an engine far off. I figured it was nothing, maybe a plane overhead or my imagination. But it grew louder, closer.

I sat up, whispering, ""Alex. Wake up. You hear that?"" He grumbled, ""What?"" The hum turned into a rumble, like a car coming down the trail. But this spot was hike-in only—no vehicles allowed. We both froze as headlights flashed through the trees, lighting up our tent like a lantern. The engine stopped nearby, doors opened and slammed. Footsteps crunched on the ground, more than one person.

""Who's that?"" Alex whispered, his voice tight. I shushed him, straining to listen. Voices now, low and mumbled. Men, sounded like two or three. One laughed, a sharp bark that made my skin crawl. They were close, maybe twenty feet away. I peeked through the tent's mesh window—couldn't see much, but shadows moved around a big truck parked right at the edge of our clearing. One guy lit a cigarette, the flame showing his face for a second: rough, bearded, eyes scanning around.

""What do we do?"" Alex hissed. ""Stay quiet. Maybe they're just lost."" But my gut said no. Why drive out here at night? The trail wasn't for cars; they'd have to have gone off-road. One of them walked closer to our tent, shining a flashlight beam right on it. The light swept over us, and I held my breath. ""Hey, anyone in there?"" the guy called out, his voice gravelly.

Alex and I exchanged looks in the dark. ""Should we answer?"" he mouthed. I shook my head no. The guy called again, ""We saw your fire earlier. Just checking if you're okay."" But something in his tone felt wrong, like he was testing us. His friends chuckled behind him. Then, silence. The flashlight clicked off, and footsteps retreated. But they didn't leave. We heard them muttering, opening the truck doors, rummaging around. Metal clinking, like tools or something worse.

Minutes dragged on. My mind raced—were they hunters? Poachers? Or something bad, like robbers who'd followed us? We'd passed a few cars at the trailhead, but nobody suspicious. Alex whispered, ""I think they're setting up camp or something."" But no, they weren't pitching tents. Instead, one started walking around our site, circling slow. I could hear his boots on the dirt, getting nearer each lap.

""They're watching us,"" I whispered back, my voice shaking a little. Alex nodded, eyes wide. We sat there, backs against the tent wall, listening. The circling stopped, but then a twig snapped right outside. Someone was right there, breathing heavy. ""I know you're awake,"" a different voice said, low through the fabric. ""Come out and say hi.""

Alex grabbed my arm. ""No way,"" he mouthed. I shook my head. My phone had no signal out here—we'd checked earlier. No way to call for help. The voice laughed softly. ""Suit yourselves. We'll be here all night."" Footsteps moved away, but not far. We heard them talking again, words like ""easy pickings"" and ""wait till morning."" My imagination went wild: what if they had knives, guns? What if they were escaped from somewhere, looking for victims in the woods?

We didn't sleep. Every sound made us jump—them shifting in their truck, one getting out to pee nearby, another coughing. Hours passed like that. Alex whispered plans: ""At first light, we pack fast and run."" I agreed, but what if they blocked the path? What if they followed? The fear built slow, like pressure in my chest. I kept picturing them bursting in, dragging us out.

Finally, gray light filtered in. We moved quiet, stuffing bags. But as I unzipped the tent a crack, I saw them: three guys around their truck, drinking coffee from thermoses, staring right at our spot. One waved mockingly. ""Morning, boys,"" he called. ""Sleep well?""

Alex and I bolted out, grabbing our packs without folding the tent. ""We're leaving,"" I said, trying to sound firm. They just laughed. ""No rush. Trail's that way."" But as we hurried past, one stepped in front, blocking us. Up close, he was big, tattoos on his arms, a scar on his cheek. ""You forgot something,"" he said, pointing to our leftover gear.

""Forget it,"" Alex snapped, pushing past. The guy grabbed his shoulder. ""Hey, manners."" I shoved the guy's hand off. ""Let go."" Tension hung thick; their eyes were cold, like they enjoyed this. The other two closed in, forming a half-circle. ""What's the hurry?"" the leader asked. ""We could share breakfast.""

""No thanks,"" I said, heart racing. We backed up, then turned and ran down the trail. Behind us, laughter, then the truck engine roared to life. ""They're coming,"" Alex panted as we sprinted. Sure enough, tires crunched on the path—they were driving after us, slow but steady, like a game.

The trail was narrow, but their truck squeezed through, branches scraping sides. We dodged roots, breaths coming hard. ""Faster!"" I yelled. Alex tripped once, scraping his knee, but got up. The truck horn blared behind, mocking. My legs burned, fear pushing me on. What if they caught us? What did they want—our stuff, or worse?

After what felt like forever, we hit a wider section, veered off into thicker trees where the truck couldn't follow. We hid behind a fallen log, listening. The engine revved, stopped. Doors opened. Footsteps searched nearby. ""Come out, come out,"" one sang. Alex and I stayed still, barely breathing. Minutes ticked. Finally, curses, doors slammed, truck backed away.

We waited longer, then circled back to the main road another way. Hitched a ride from a passing ranger, told him everything. He said there'd been reports of sketchy folks harassing campers in that area—maybe squatters or thieves. We never went back for our tent. Even now, thinking about those voices outside, the circling footsteps, the chase—it makes me shudder. What if we'd answered that first call? What if they'd decided not to wait?





# “FOURTH NIGHT”:

We finally made it happen one summer, starting from Echo Lake and aiming for Donner Pass. It would take us five days, about seventy miles through beautiful mountains and lakes. We packed light, with tents, food, and a small gun just in case of wild animals. The first day went smooth, walking past clear water and setting up by Aloha Lake.

On the second day, we climbed over Dicks Pass, high up at ten thousand feet. The views took our breath away, with snow patches still on the ground even in warm months. We pushed hard, thirteen miles, and camped in a quiet spot. The third day felt easier, through forests and open fields to Richardson Lake. We built a fire, shared some drinks, and relaxed. Jordan pulled out a bag of dried mushrooms he had hidden. ""Want to try?"" he asked with a grin. Alex shrugged and took a bit. I chewed half a piece, not wanting too much. Soon, a warm feeling spread through us. We laughed a lot, staring at the stars. In the fun of it, we howled at the moon like wolves, our voices echoing across the water.

The fourth day brought us along ridges above a big lake. Our feet hurt from blisters, but we kept going. That night, we found a flat area near the trail for our last camp before the end. We sat by the fire, eating our last meal and talking about how proud we felt. ""This trip changed me,"" Alex said, poking the flames with a stick. Jordan nodded. ""Best decision ever."" I agreed, feeling close to both of them.

Footsteps crunched on the dry ground nearby. We looked up as a man limped into the firelight. He looked rough, with dirty clothes hanging loose on his thin frame. His face caught me off guard—his cheek sunk in deep, like part of his jaw had gone missing long ago. His eyes gleamed small and sharp, like a rat's in the dark. ""Mind if I join?"" he asked, his voice low and scratchy. We glanced at each other. Jordan spoke first. ""Sure, sit down."" The man eased onto a log across from us, rubbing his bad leg. ""Been hiking these hills my whole life,"" he said. ""My family has roots here from way back.""

We tried to be polite. I asked, ""You out here alone?"" He smiled slow, showing uneven teeth. ""Family's always close."" Then he tilted his head. ""You boys armed?"" Alex shifted uneasy. ""We have a small pistol, for protection."" The man chuckled soft. ""Smart. Woods can turn bad quick."" He stared into the fire for a long minute, the flames dancing on his twisted face. Suspense built as silence stretched. Finally, he leaned forward. ""Want to hear a story? A true one, from these parts.""

Jordan nodded. ""Go ahead."" The man cleared his throat. ""Three city boys like you came hiking this same trail. They started at Echo Lake, pushed over Dicks Pass on day two, rested by Richardson Lake on day three. On the fourth night, they sat by a fire, feeling good about themselves. They had taken some mushrooms, howled at the moon like fools."" My skin prickled. How did he know? Alex whispered, ""That's us."" But the man kept going. ""A handsome stranger limped into their camp, just like I did. He sat down, asked if the boys were armed. They said yes, a small pistol. The stranger laughed, said the woods were full of dangers.""

He paused, eyes locking on mine. ""The boys got nervous. The stranger told them they were dumb for coming out here, lucky to still breathe. One boy thought about grabbing the gun, but the stranger warned him—his cousins hid in the dark, rifles pointed at their heads. 'See you around,' the stranger said, and limped away. Footsteps followed, more than one pair."" Jordan's face went pale. ""That's our story. How do you know?"" The man stood slow, his limp more noticeable. ""Because I'm that handsome stranger."" He grinned wide, the hole in his cheek pulling tight. ""And my family's watching right now.""

We jumped up. I scanned the trees, but saw only blackness. The man turned and limped into the shadows. His footsteps faded, but then more sounds came—branches snapping, leaves rustling from different spots. ""We need to go,"" Alex said, voice shaking. We grabbed our packs fast, not even putting out the fire. As we hurried down the trail in the dark, using our flashlights, whispers seemed to float from the woods. ""See you around,"" a voice echoed faint. We didn't stop, pushing those last miles through the night.

At Donner Pass in the morning, we collapsed, safe at last. We told a ranger what happened, but he just said drifters sometimes wander the trails. Police checked, found no one. We never hiked that path again. Now, when I close my eyes, I see that sunken face by the fire, and hear those extra footsteps in the dark. What if his family really waited out there, rifles ready? The thought keeps me awake.





# “CLOSED CAMPSITE”:

We wanted to see the big trees and quiet spots along the west coast. We rented a small car and packed our tent, some food, and sleeping bags. One evening, we needed a place to stop for the night. We saw a sign for a campsite off the main road, but it looked old and the gate was open. We drove in anyway, thinking it might be fine.

The road inside was bumpy and covered with leaves. We passed a few empty spots before we saw some tents set up in a circle. It looked like people were staying there, but everything was quiet. We picked a spot a little away from the others and started unloading our stuff. As we set up the tent, two men walked over from the woods. They were thin and their clothes were dirty. One had a hoodie zipped up but no shirt under it. The other had messy hair and kept scratching his arm.

""Hey, you guys new here?"" the one in the hoodie asked, talking really fast. His eyes darted around.

""Yeah, just stopping for the night,"" Tom said, standing up straight. ""Is this place open? The sign was down.""

The other guy laughed, but it didn't sound friendly. ""Open? Sure, it's open for folks like us. We're here working on the trails. Seasonal stuff. Name's Rick, this is Dave.""

""I'm Tom, this is my girlfriend,"" Tom replied, putting his arm around me. I smiled but felt uneasy. Their hands shook a little when they talked.

""You got any extra water?"" Dave asked, stepping closer. ""We're running low.""

We gave them a bottle from our cooler. They thanked us and walked back to their tent, whispering to each other. I watched them go, noticing how they moved quick, like they were in a hurry.

We finished setting up and started a small fire to cook hot dogs. Tom and I sat close, talking about the drive tomorrow. ""This place feels off,"" I whispered to him. ""Those guys seem weird.""

""Probably just tired workers,"" Tom said, but he looked around too. ""We'll leave early in the morning.""

A car pulled in then, a white one with loud music thumping. It stopped near the other tents, and someone got out, looked around, then got back in and drove away fast. That made my skin prickle. Why come and go so quick?

Later, an older woman came over from her pickup truck parked nearby. She had gray hair tied back and coughed a lot. ""You kids shouldn't stay here,"" she said in a rough voice. ""This ain't a safe spot. Strange things happen at night. People act crazy, like they're not right in the head.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked, my voice quiet.

She leaned in. ""Folks disappear sometimes. Or they start fighting over nothing. You hear screams? That's when you pack up and run. I'm just saying, watch yourselves.""

Tom nodded. ""Thanks for the warning. We'll be careful.""

She walked away, still coughing. I looked at Tom. ""Maybe we should find another place.""

""It's getting late,"" he said. ""Let's just eat and go to bed. I'll keep the flashlight handy.""

We ate our food, but I couldn't relax. The fire crackled, and I kept glancing at the other tents. No one came out, but I heard low voices now and then. After we put out the fire, we got into the tent and zipped it up. Tom held me close. ""It's okay,"" he whispered. ""Just some odd people.""

I tried to sleep, but then I heard arguing from one of the tents. It was Rick and Dave. ""You took it all!"" one yelled. ""Give it back!""

""Shut up, man!"" the other snapped. ""They'll hear you.""

The arguing stopped, but then footsteps crunched on the leaves. Someone was walking around. I nudged Tom. ""Listen,"" I said softly.

He sat up. ""Stay here."" He unzipped the tent a little and peeked out with the flashlight. ""I see one of them going to the woman's truck.""

The footsteps got closer to us, then stopped. I held my breath. Was someone standing outside our tent? Tom shone the light, but no one was there. ""Must have gone back,"" he said, but his voice shook a bit.

We lay back down, but sleep wouldn't come. More footsteps, this time circling our spot. Crunch, crunch, pause. Then again. ""Tom, that's not normal,"" I whispered. ""Why would they walk around like that?""

""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""Maybe they're looking for something.""

The woman started coughing again, loud and hacking. Then her truck door opened, and I heard mumbling. ""You got it?"" a man's voice said. It sounded like Dave.

""Yeah, but keep it down,"" she replied. ""Those new ones might call someone.""

My mind raced. What were they talking about? It didn't sound like trail work. Tom and I stayed still, listening. The footsteps came back, closer. Something brushed against the tent fabric, like a hand sliding along it. I grabbed Tom's arm. ""Did you feel that?""

He nodded, eyes wide. ""We need to get out of here. Quietly.""

We started packing our sleeping bags, trying not to make noise. But then the arguing started again, louder. ""You owe me!"" Rick shouted from their tent. ""Hand it over!""

A zipper opened, and footsteps stormed out. I peeked through a small gap in our tent door. Rick was heading to the woman's truck, his face twisted angry. He looked right at our tent, eyes locking on the gap where I was watching. He stopped, stared for a long moment, then kept going.

""Tom, he saw me,"" I whispered, my hands cold.

""Keep packing,"" Tom said. ""We're leaving now.""

We stuffed everything into bags fast. Outside, Rick climbed into the woman's truck cab. I saw shadows moving inside, and smoke curled out the window. They were doing something in there, heads close together. Dave came out of his tent, looking around sneaky, like he was guarding.

We loaded the car. Tom turned the key, but the engine revved and the car didn't move. ""What's wrong?"" I asked, panic rising.

He checked. ""The brake is on. Hang on."" He released it, and we started backing up slowly. As we turned, the woman's truck lights flashed on, bright and blinding. I shielded my eyes. Then, a scream cut through the air – high and sharp, like someone in pain.

""Drive!"" I said to Tom.

He hit the gas, and we bounced down the road. In the rearview mirror, I saw figures running after us for a bit, then stopping. The scream echoed again, fading as we got farther.

We didn't stop until we found a small town with a bed and breakfast. The owner let us in late, and we told her a little about it. She nodded. ""That old site? It's been closed for years. Bad folks hang out there sometimes, doing drugs and worse.""

We switched cars the next day, just in case. I still think about that night. What if we had stayed? What were they really doing in those tents? The way they watched us, the screams – it felt like we barely got away from something awful.





# “STANLEY CREEK”:

I grabbed my backpack and headed into the Willamette National Forest for a quick overnight trip. My dog needed the exercise, and I craved some peace after a long week. I drove down a gravel road south of Oakridge, found a quiet spot off the path near Staley Creek, and set up my small tent. The river rushed nearby, birds called, and it felt perfect.

As I boiled water for coffee, a pickup truck rolled up slowly. A middle-aged man got out, wearing a worn jacket and boots. He looked around, then walked over. ""Nice spot you got here,"" he said. ""You alone?""

""Just me and my dog,"" I answered, keeping my tone light. ""Taking a break from town.""

He nodded. ""Seen any other folks around? Couple came through earlier, looking for a place to camp. Older man and woman, with a dog.""

I shook my head. ""Haven't seen anyone. It's pretty empty out here.""

He lingered, staring at my tent. ""Be careful. Roads get tricky at night. People sometimes get lost."" He gave a small smile, then got back in his truck and drove off.

I brushed it off, but something felt wrong. I finished my coffee fast and walked my dog along the creek. No other camps in sight. The forest seemed bigger as the light faded.

After dark, I zipped into the tent with my dog curled beside me. I tried to sleep, but around midnight, I heard a dog barking—not mine. It came from down the path, sharp and frantic. Then voices, low at first, then louder. A man shouted something I couldn't make out.

My dog perked up, ears forward. I whispered for him to stay quiet. More barking, then a sharp crack—like a branch snapping, but louder. Another crack. Silence.

I lay still, heart racing. My dog trembled. No more sounds. I waited an hour, listening. Nothing.

I couldn't stay. I quietly packed my gear in the dark, stuffed everything into my pack, and slipped out with my dog on leash. We walked fast to my car, glancing back the whole way. The truck was gone, no lights anywhere.

I drove to the nearest ranger station at dawn and reported the noises. The ranger took notes but said it might have been hunters or poachers. I went home, uneasy.

Days later, news broke: A couple had been shot and killed at a campsite near Staley Creek. Their dog too. Police found the bodies after other campers stumbled on the scene. The victims were a local teacher and her boyfriend, out for a simple trip. No arrests, no clear motive.

I read the descriptions and realized the spot was close to where I'd camped. The barking, the shouts, the shots—they matched the timeline. The man in the truck had asked about a couple with a dog. I wonder if he was looking for them. Or if I was next.

I still hike, but never alone anymore. That night taught me how fast the woods can turn dangerous.",1,1768082186.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

**A single mother, a young teacher, and a city that watches—Mangalore Buns is a story about love that arrives at the wrong time, in the wrong way, and asks what we owe ourselves versus those who depend on us.**

I have the entire story, just putting one chapter and the concept out there to start with.

**Chapter 1: No sunshine in September**

September in Bangalore was deceptive. The sun softened, the trees turned theatrical shades of orange and brown, and afternoons invited indulgence—naps, second coffees, lingering silences. It was the kind of weather that made people kinder to themselves.

Dharma did not feel kind to himself at all.

He wore a gray vest and navy trousers and sat at a small wooden desk inside a classroom that smelled faintly of chalk and floor cleaner, waiting for parents to arrive. Outside, the corridor buzzed with muffled conversations, shuffling feet, and the occasional reprimand from a nun reminding someone to lower their voice.

Parent-Teacher Meetings before Diwali were notorious. Expectations ran high. Anxiety ran higher. Every parent wanted reassurance that their child would emerge victorious after the festival—unscathed by sweets, relatives, or distraction.

Dharma glanced at the neatly stacked report cards in front of him and took a deep breath.

This was his second year at St. Agnes Convent School, one of the more prominent schools in the city. He was twenty-six, taught Chemistry to students from grades eight to ten, and was still considered new, no matter how many months passed.

He liked the job. He liked that the school was reputable, that it came with free transportation, subsidised meals at the canteen, and the quiet pride of telling people where he worked. He liked that he hadn’t had to start his career at a lesser-known institution where ambition went unnoticed.

What he didn’t like was being young.

The senior teachers treated him with indulgent impatience. His ideas were dismissed gently, like suggestions from someone who would eventually grow out of his enthusiasm. The Head of the Chemistry Department reminded him often to “temper” his methods, to be less experimental, less eager.

But his students—his students made it worth it.

They told him about PlayStation games he didn’t understand and Netflix shows he pretended not to watch. They complained about equations but secretly liked it when he explained reactions as stories instead of formulas. When a student showed even mild curiosity about Chemistry, Dharma felt a flicker of validation, proof that his presence mattered.

One by one, parents filed in.

There were the familiar types.

The perpetually dissatisfied ones, whose children ranked in the top ten percent but somehow still weren’t enough. The socially ambitious ones, who wanted their children to befriend only “good influences.” The embarrassed ones, who avoided eye contact because their child was struggling. And finally, the universal solution-seekers—parents who believed tuition classes could fix anything.

Three hours passed.

Coffee cups accumulated.

Voices rose, softened, repeated themselves.

By the time the last mother left—after telling Dharma that her daughter enjoyed life *too much*—he felt drained.

“She will pass,” the woman had said dismissively. “She’s too busy enjoying life.”

Dharma smiled politely and handed her a tissue when her daughter began to cry.

“Don’t worry, Madam,” he said aloud. “Anju will do well.”

What he didn’t say was that Anju’s idea of enjoying life involved music and art, things her mother had never learned to value.

When the classroom finally emptied, Dharma exhaled and leaned back in his chair.

Then he noticed Yogi.

The boy sat quietly at the back of the classroom, swinging his legs, backpack still on. He hadn’t complained. He hadn’t asked questions. He was waiting.

Dharma checked the time.

*She’s late.*

Just as he considered packing up, the classroom door burst open.

“I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry—”

Ambika Bhat entered like a gust of wind.

She wore a lavender shirt dotted with yellow sunflowers, small gold hoops glinting against her ears. She was slightly breathless, her curls framing her face in soft disarray. Her presence filled the room effortlessly.

“I got stuck on Outer Ring Road,” she continued. “It was chaos.”

“It’s alright,” Dharma said quickly. “Please.”

She smiled apologetically and sat down, immediately reaching for Yogi’s report card.

Dharma noticed, unnecessarily, that lavender looked beautiful on her. He disliked the colour generally. Greys and blues were his preference.

*Did she do something different with her hair?* he wondered.

“I’ve already gone through his grades online,” Ambika said, scanning the paper. “I wanted to have a discussion.”

They talked through Yogi’s weaknesses carefully. Dharma explained patterns, attention lapses, small improvements. When he offered to take exclusive tuition for Yogi, he meant it genuinely.

“That won’t be necessary,” Ambika said gently. “I’ve almost finalised a private tutor. He can cover Math and Science. He's got a Master’s degree and experience in an international school.”

Dharma felt something tighten.

“This isn’t about what happened in the past,” he said, trying to sound calm. “Yogi is bright. I’ve spent enough time with him to know how he learns.”

“I didn’t question your intentions,” she replied. “I just think this is best for him.”

“Private tutors are expensive,” he said, noticing the way her foot tapped nervously against the table.

“I’ll manage,” she said. “Let’s review after the mock exams.”

The conversation ended neatly. There was more to say but nobody said it.

She left quickly, her perfume lingering behind...familiar, unsettling.

Dharma sat there longer than necessary inhaling it.",1,1768081930.0,BollywoodWriters,0,1.0,False

Lo and behold, ACTUAL MY LITTLE PONY COFFEE CAME UP!!!! The company is called Joyground Coffee, and they do have an official license from Hasbro to sell MLP coffee and some merch. I ordered an MLP mug and two bags of coffee, and it’s all awesome. Both coffee flavors I got taste legitimately really good. I do wish the mug were bigger, more wide, like a camping style mug, but it is still very adorable, and I just love the unicorn design so much. Anyway, that’s my “haul.” :)

Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind works and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1768081621.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

We hit it off really good and connected. We called everyday, video call played PUBg. She even told me she loved me. Then I had to go another work project that took longer than expected and internet was bad. Lost most contact due to work and message her every chance I could get. I was on a boat with no wifi. She was waiting for me to come back. I feel bad. 

Anyways I finally was coming back a year later but she got a new boyfriend. It was because of my absence led to it. We were secretly talking, video calling. Planning to meet me for ""coffee"" once I was there. 

I messed up I texted her made her ping go off while he was there. It freaked her out, got stressed. She almost got caught. She told me to text her the next following night. I did. Then she blocks me on WA, unfollows me on IG. It's very disheartening since so much we been through. She finally got back to me on her business page. Telling me very quick she understands, she is serious about him, don't text her please. 

I'm like okay,  is she keeping me as an ""option"" if her new boyfriend it doesn't work out with her? If she was serious about him why she kept secretly talking to me. Which tells me he isn't fulfilling something that she wants/needs. 

She only acted this way because she almost got caught. I know she is testing me on some bs girls do. I'm like do I continue to text her telling her which I don't care about her bf or wait it out, just go no contact for a while? Her birthday is coming up in a month or so.

She said, “Your great great grandfather likely took the photos in that catalog. The coffee table you have is likely the one in the catalog since he would occasionally be gifted the furniture after photographing it. I don’t know how to prove it but I’m pretty sure he’s the photographer.”

I’m going to try to make this short as I can while providing the info. I (M 22 at the time) was barely becoming comfortable with myself and sexuality. I’m from a culture where being gay is extremely looked down upon and not accepted, I was barely accepted by my family(but that’s a whole different story). I met, let’s call him Bruce(M 28), over Facebook. We’d like statuses of each other and pics, the usual facebook stuff without actually speaking to each other. I decided to make the first move and start talking to him and we decided to go on a date. It was magical, it was a date I’ve always wanted, it wasn’t anything fancy, it was a coffee shop date but I was smitten. From his looks, to the charm, to his vibes we had. We saw each other for little over a month before making it official. 

The first year and a half, it was a relationship I’ve always dreamed about, it was filled with love, care, affection, and it felt so nice after leaving a really abusive relationship before that. I thought I finally found the one and I couldn’t believe it actually happened. Towards the end of the 2nd year, things felt….off. He started working two jobs and it felt like at one point I saw him once a month. One night he met me for dinner and it appeared as if he lost 30lbs. I was getting scared, things didn’t feel right but I kept telling myself it was just anxiety and maybe I was just making things up in my head.

Fast forward about 7months the later, I find out he was emotionally cheating on me with people online, more than likely it was physical as well but I didn’t have concrete proof. A month later I found out he was not only using meth, cocaine, and other party drugs, he was also selling them. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life was rakija (a strong Balkan type of alcohol), to say it shocked me would be an understatement, I never saw it coming, then again, I basically hardly ever saw him. 

The abuse start around the time I found these things out, from emotional to financial and afterwards, physical. He always kept asking for money but I didn’t understand why since he had two jobs, or so I thought. During one really bad argument, I bought him flowers and a new pair of jeans and wanted to surprise at work, I’ve been there before so they knew me.  They were surprised to see me, apparently he was fired 3 months ago! 

I’m going to summarize the next couple of years because it’s a lot and we’d be reading a novel. To put it shortly, he was arrested multiple times, charges from drugs to identity theft and more. I was a college student, I worked part time in retail, and I was manipulated by him into bailing him out in the name of love( I was a fucking dumb ass, trust me, I know) . I spent well over 15k in bail money, hotel stays for him, and commissary. After I had enough, then the stalking came, I was afraid to go out to places because he knew my places. Ended up doing the anti stalking, I’d know when he’d arrive at certain places that I’d leave before running into him (it’s a small big city and limited good places to go). Changed numbers, wanted to delete my social media, didn’t know who to trust cuz he’d have his spies reporting to him everywhere. If I tried to delete it, I’d be hearing from him from random numbers, he’d catfish me on dating accounts, it was pure hell. I couldn’t trust anyone besides my family and a couple of close friends.

I left the going out scene at 28 after being drugged (to this day I still think it was someone close to him) because it wasn’t safe for me anymore. At 30, I thought after almost 2 years of never hearing from him again, it was over. As I was finally getting my life together, finally stated work at a place I’ve always wanted to work in, things started getting bad. I started dating again and met a really sweet guy and I thought that maybe my life can start over again at 30.

My identity was stolen, cards started being activated in my name, except one when the mistake came, it was under his name. After about 2 years of radio silence, after everything he took from me, he decided to take more. It put a huge strain on my relationship and it eventually broke, and I don’t blame him for leaving, no one deserves that. After that, I didn’t wanna bring anyone else into my life, they don’t deserve the stress of this monster, I felt like it was a lifelong curse. Always looking over my shoulder, afraid that after I moved out of my parents house that he’d try to do something to them, afraid of going on a vacation because of the what ifs, and scared that he’d know where I live and surprise me by showing up at my apartment. It’s a special kind of hell to be living in.

Fast forward 3 years later, as I was scrolling through insta I saw posts of him by a mutual and I quickly scrolled through, but, something felt odd. I scrolled back, it started out as memorial and then it said it, ha had passed. I couldn’t believe it, I was at work and just said out loud “omg he’s dead, I’m free”. A coworker asked if everything is ok, and I repeated it “my ex is dead” they asked with concern if I was ok and I just blurted out “I’m exhilarated! I need to go on a break” and left. While driving back home, I finally felt free, I felt a huge dark cloud finally pass, I finally felt like I could start living again without fear again, I actually laughed, cried tears of joy, thankful that the monster and abuser is gone. He could no longer have any other victims, he could no longer hurt anyone ever again! I felt like Theoden after Saruman left his body, I felt like the air was a little crisper and a new dawn shown through. 

When a former friend reached out the next day to tell me, I told her that I knew and may he rest in piss and that I was finally free. She ended up getting very upset with me, called me an asshole, and blocked me. She knew every detail of what that man did to me, to the point that as soon as I heard his name, even if it wasn’t about him, I’d start getting anxious and couldn’t say the name back. It was like Voldemort to me, to me he really was “he who shall not be named”. A few people didn’t like the fact I felt happy about his death and blocked me but many others understood why I felt the way I did.

There is a trend with modern real estate to rip out the rug throughout the house, apartments especially and replace it with trendy engineered wood vinyl flooring. In some, not even bothering to install fans. 

This applies to APARTMENT, CONODS, and any home where your neighbor lives above you/ under you. IF YOU SEE NEW MANUFACTURED WOOD, YOU CAN ASSUME THEY SKIPPED batting the joist bay or using QUALITY SOUND-UNERLAYMENT. You will hear EVERY step the person above you makes, it will wake you up, it will keep you from sleeping early. You will hear kids horse playing, dogs running or barking. You will hear the cat toy bouncing around the corner of a room, big foot walking down the hallway to the kitchen and back. You will learn your upstairs neighbors entire way of life, when they eat, when the kids play, when it’s relax time. 

Just a warning, It’s not the same as a music noise complaint, you’ll wish it was that simple. You cannot complain to your property manager that your neighbor is doing normal things and causing disruptive noise. Apartments are now rushing to make the move as a return investment project. 

If you do not have what it takes to take on the highest floor move and daily trek beware. The floors are paper thin, and the properties that were built with space for rugs, even thinner because of lack of foresight/ design. It’s all designed around cost, but we need to keep standard rugs in the rooms. Not just because tradition and for the bare foot experience of ‘home room’, but because it suppresses sound in the most vulnerable most important peaceful places in the dwelling. Regardless, if you value peace or are easily distracted and tuned into constant side noise like interval floor thumping and striking in your home I implore you to be very direct with your search and be willing to look elsewhere. This is roulette when you select a home that’s not on top floor at total wood floor properties. 

Be up front ask them for information on if there was any acoustic underlayment installed in construction. Especially if there were rugs removed. 9 times out of 10 there would have been no need for optional acoustic sound suppression in the flooring because it was built with rugs in mind originally. Be careful but particular. There is always an elsewhere with amenities and property substitute. If needed go into the property take your shoes off when viewing, you should usually be able to tell right there and then. What you hear is what you’ll hear above you

2 - the history of the land your property is being /was built over. It seems silly and unimportant when you’re in a time crunch or moving states and focusing more on distance to your nearest anchor plazas/ points of interest for jobs and recreation, but lands built over drained swamps and lakes. They will be prone to year round mosquito swarms, mice, roaches, and one no one talks about and try to conceal from buyers; The micro ants. 

In southern climate, especially marsh, lake, ocean, swamp lands Micro ants infest them, and are very small hive like creatures with one track minds to find damp, find food, and reproduce. They are nearly impossible to get rid of. They are extremely attracted to heat and water, about as much as food. They are so small people with poor/ aged eyesight may not even be able to pick them up, as they crawl the lining of rooms, kitchens, and pantries. They make home in your sinks, corners of walls, and bathrooms and become a near permanent infestation. You cannot leave food ready to serve on counter tops, you cannot miss dropped foods and crumbs, they will swarm it in seconds. Take a closer look you may have an infestation right now and never noticed. They get in Your drinks, your table top Tervis, coffee, or drink you thought was safe, and when you notice them the worst thing happens where you realize you may have consumed them in your fluids or foods. 

Eventually they stop using just wall lining and make routes through the main flooring especially when you have wood or tile flooring because it’s flat, and it actually helps promote their proper navigate. They are strong on pheromones. Fairly similar to the way roaches operate. Drippings and scents to mark locations. For example if you smash one many will appear out of thin air to check on the ant, it’s a never ending cycle of madness. I have been in multiple homes and people didn’t notice they were crawling on their beds likely in their hair or body overnight. Most worrisome, an elderly lady didn’t notice them right on her bedside desk crawling freely between her bed, on her, and her things . 

You cannot get rid of them permanently because their source are millions in damp grounds under and surrounding the property and all over the vegetation. You’ll have 1 property that food will break down if left out, drinks will develop bacteria before any bugs and you’ll have the ones with ghost ants, that appear as soon as food is placed on the counter or table tops.

1q9gezt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9gezt,Mods?,"Hey guys, I'm curious what mods will best help me create good espresso and bring the Rancilio Silvia up to a higher level. 

I just upgraded the shower head to an IMS with a countersunk screw. 
I also ordered the little device that quiets the pump that's attached to the end of it.
I will add sound dampening sheets to the inside of the body and add some rubber between the frame and the body to eliminate some rattling.

I currently have the entire machine taken apart as my gasket failed and I decided to replace everything I can and treat a bit of rust on the frame plus proper cleaning of everything.

I am replacing the following:

-boiler o ring
-group head gasket (silicone with silicone grease)
-steamwand o rings
-steam wand teflon inserts/gaskets 
-o rings on the solenoid head or whatever it's called

Now for additional upgrades, maybe now, maybe down the line.

Should I do a gagguino or gaggimate? Or should I maybe just do a PID? I don't see the point of a pressure gauge and dimmer mod, but maybe someone can tell me why they are useful.

I am a noob at espresso, I have made a few shots on the Rancilio but it has mostly stayed unused since I got it as it's not convenient compared to my incredible instant coffee hahah. But I wanna start using it now, I'm gonna have it hooked up to a smart switch so that it can start warming up 30 minutes before my alarm rings in the mornings. 

My current gripe with the machine is that I couldn't quite grasp the whole temperature surfing thing, plus my second shot always ended up bad for whatever reason. 

Thank you all in advance for the help setting this thing up properly!",3,1768080899.0,ranciliosilvia,4,1.0,False
1q9gen3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1q9gen3/i_finally_figured_out_how_to_get_to_the_i_am/,"I finally figured out how to get to the 'I AM' state, Neville mentioned.","Well this was a journey, and it'll be a journey for you too.

Neville said to just repeat 'I AM' until you become this faceless presence, and I have a lot of respect for the man but I had absolutely no idea what tf that meant. I mean I understood the concept, but what the heck is a faceless presence? 

Anyway, I figured it out.

My first assumption was that you just keep meditating until your brain shuts off and then whatever is left is that presence and I was on the right track sort of, but there are a few doors you have to go through to get there, atleast for the first time.

What I originally envisioned was meditating, mind gets quieter and quieter until it's silent and then boom! Magic.

But it's not, for those of you who have taken acid or mushrooms you'll understand this.

You've got to do that initial step, meditate until things are quiet, then you have to watch for incoming thoughts, not get attached to them, then take a step back, then go and sit on a fence and then try and look at who's sitting on the fence without associating with it.

Yea - it's a recursive nightmare!

And that's how I initially discovered it, because I started laughing, there was nothing else my brain could do, I had become the mirror looking at itself in the mirror, that was it, I couldn't go deeper, and it all clicked. That was it, that faceless presence, that base consciousness, the all comes from consciousness as Neville says. It was the very purest essence of existence, with no mental or physical attachment to it.

So, how did I get there?

Well, for the first time, it's going to take a while, it's easy, but it's not quick. I say it's easy because you can't force yourself here, if you do, you're rocking the boat when your trying to balance 5 brooms one on top of the other. Don't bother. Wait til the seas are calm, then get your brooms. 

The first thing I do, is like a mental warmup or stretch. I get a coffee, get my vape, and just go and watch the breath for however long. Things are going to crop up, something will ache, something will need stretching, ill get thirsty, hungry, need the toilet, that's all perfectly fine. Get it all out of the way **WHILE** you're meditating. It's perfectly okay to get up do something and come back, this is the warm up, you're transitioning into that peaceful state, not sitting yourself down shackled and trudging forward. Be easy on yourself.

Then when you're settled and comfortable then you can start focusing on the breath. Do whatever you need to do to maintain that focus. Count to 100 count to 4, or 10, go have a cigarette - whatever. This is the longest part.

After you can consistently count the breath you'll go a level deeper and start seeing thoughts arising, and this is where you choose to not associate with them. ""Oh a thought is coming, yea whatever, back to the breath."" you'll get caught up in a thought but over time they'll get further and further between until you can see a thought and just not be bothered. It'll come, you'll let it pass, and come back to the breath. 

Now then, the next level. Thoughts have come, you haven't attached to them, they've continued to pass by and now it's smooth sailing. So let go of the wheel and just be. Let the ship sail itself. You've meditated to quiet the mind, the ego has quietened, you've become the observer who can watch thoughts and the ego come and go without judgement, and now you're putting that on autopilot. You've settled into the awareness of the observer. That's already pretty frickin deep! Here you're just being. You're not consciously choosing to not associate with a thought anymore. You are just sat on the fence watching, like your favourite movie, your engrossed, but not emotionally, you're just there. It is what it is.

Now, here's the final level, here's where you get to the 'I AM'. You have moved from the self, to the ego, to the observer, to the awareness of the observer, and now you're heading into the light that shines with the awareness of the observer. (It's russian dolls all the way down kid!) 

You'll feel when you've gotten here, because again **like Neville says,** you'll feel a sense of relief, the weight will lift off your shoulders. You may laugh like I did, or just feel everything drift away. 

But how do you become aware of the light within the awareness of the observer? Well, you've set the autopilot on so those thoughts can't distract you, and you're sat on the fence. Ask yourself, ""Who is this who is sat on the fence?"" then bingo! Go into that space and you'll feel it.

And guess what will happen? **You'll lose it straight away.** But that's okay, it's perfectly normal. You are now the awareness looking back on itself. As soon as you realise, oh there is base consciousness, you've objectified it and now you're back sat on the fence. You can go inside and look what is within once again, but once you objectify things you'll throw yourself out. I only learned to do this a couple of days ago so I don't have much information on how to stay there for long periods of time yet. 

But, this awareness and relief you feel, you can go straight back to that in everyday life. It's a deeper awareness than self-awareness. When you say ""I am here."" that's awareness, but you'll feel the difference between that and true ""I AM"" without words. I used to think they were the same thing. They are not.

\-

So what do you do when you're there?

Well, that's where all of creation starts. That is the thing that 3D reality lags behind, that place is the very pinnacle of creation. 

So go there, and be whatever you want to be, and then wait for the 3D to catch up.

Your desires, take them to that place, feel that relief and BOOM! Instant creation as Neville says, all manifestation is instant. It's there! That's the place you go to get it. Then it literally is just a case of 3D reality catching up.

\-

*NOTE: Also, this process has taken me 1-2 hours on average and I've done it 3 times so don't expect it to be quick. But don't worry you have the guide here, it's not hard, it just takes time.*

\-

**QUICK TIPS**

Getting frustrated? Stop. Cup of tea. Come back. Something easy, something light, go for a walk or something. But don't procrastinate. 

Thoughts keep coming? Keep coming back to the breath. Doesnt matter, that's what thoughts do, they will keep coming.

Getting distracted by something outside? Go get some brown or green noise on.

Falling asleep? Have a coffee. By the time you get the jitters you'll be so deep in meditation you'll be like 2 layers removed from physical sensation, it wont matter.

Uncomfortable mentally? That's your ego. It's fighting because it doesn't know what's on the other side. It's trying to keep you in old patterns to keep you safe. Tell it you can take the reigns, write it a letter and address it's concerns.

Uncomfortable physically? Take some paracetamol, sit on a chair, move somewhere more comfortable. ",18,1768080877.0,NevilleGoddard,9,0.95,False

1q9gcv5,https://youtu.be/zm18FwSngXg?si=PZUs5dQ74zJahSnd,Video review of my experience with the Cometeer discovery box (TLDR review in comments),"TLDR: I ordered a Cometeer discovery box not really knowing what to expect as it seems like the variety of reviews I’ve seen of the Cometeer have come from influencers/paid sponsors. So I set out to give an unbiased review where I went in blind, meaning I didn’t see any tasting notes before actually tasting the varieties. I tried each of the 8 discovery pack varieties in both hot and iced form. My overall findings were: 
-I could not taste ANY of the reported tasting notes on my own, without being told what they were “supposed” to taste like making me feel like the tasting notes were either very embellished or my palette is very underdeveloped— likely some of both

-I enjoyed 4 out of the 8 coffees enough to give a “thumbs up” on the Cometeer app and would actively seek them out again. 

-overall I though the coffee was really quite good despite potential embellishing of tasting notes. For the convenience/easy preparation, it feels like it’s difficult to find a better quality coffee that doesn’t need to be brewed at home. A lot better than home brewed “ grocery store”coffee too. It was good enough for me to be willing to try at least a couple months of subscription to see if my feedback on the discovery box leads to the curation of more coffee varieties I enjoy more.

1q9gcr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1q9gcr0/how_to_tell_if_someone_likes_you_the_psychology/,How to Tell if Someone LIKES You: The Psychology Behind Attraction Signals You Keep Missing,"Spent way too much time researching human behavior because I kept missing obvious signals. Turns out most of us are terrible at reading attraction cues. Studied psychology research, body language experts, and dating coaches to figure out what actually means something vs what we imagine matters.

Here's what I learned that changed everything.

## The stuff that actually means something:

* **They remember weird details you mentioned once.** Not just your birthday or job. I'm talking about that random story about your childhood dog or how you hate cilantro. When someone's into you, their brain basically hoards information about you without even trying. It's subconscious. Research shows we have better memory recall for people we're attracted to. If they bring up something you mentioned three weeks ago in passing? Yeah. That's not casual.

* **Their body literally turns toward you.** Forget eye contact for a second. Watch feet and torso direction. When someone likes you, their body orientation shifts to face you even when they're talking to other people. It's called ""fronting"" in body language research. Psychologist Vanessa Van Edwards covers this extensively in her work on nonverbal communication. Your lizard brain does this automatically when it wants to connect with someone.

* **They find excuses to be in your space.** ""Oh weird, I'm also getting coffee at this exact time."" ""Crazy running into you here."" Sometimes it's not crazy or weird. Sometimes it's calculated. People engineer proximity when they're interested. Pay attention to patterns, not coincidences.

* **Mirroring gets real.** They adopt your speech patterns, match your energy, copy your posture. This isn't mocking, it's called the chameleon effect. Studies in *Social Psychology Quarterly* found that we unconsciously mimic people we want to bond with. If you lean back and they lean back ten seconds later? If you say ""no way"" and suddenly that's their new phrase? Your brain recognizes you as someone worth syncing up with.

* **They get weirdly nervous or extra confident around you.** Both extremes mean something. Some people clam up and fumble. Others overcompensate with jokes or stories. Either way, their baseline behavior shifts because you make them feel something. In *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (legit the best book on understanding relationship patterns and attachment styles), they explain how attraction triggers our nervous system differently based on our attachment style. Anxious types might get chatty and intense. Avoidant types might seem aloof but keep showing up. Context matters.

* **Touch happens in small, plausible ways.** Arm grazes. Shoulder taps. ""Let me see your phone"" hand brushes. According to research on haptic communication, we create reasons to touch people we're attracted to while maintaining plausible deniability. It's testing boundaries without risk. If someone consistently finds tiny reasons to make physical contact, even briefly, they're probably interested. Obviously read the vibe and respect boundaries, but light touch is a huge indicator.

* **They text differently with you.** Faster responses. Longer messages. More questions. Actual effort to continue conversations instead of letting them die. They initiate. They double text. They send you things that reminded them of you. Communication patterns don't lie. The book *Modern Romance* by Aziz Ansari (yeah the comedian, but it's actually research based) breaks down digital age dating behavior. Bottom line: people make time for what matters to them.

* **Their friends act weird around you.** Knowing looks. Inside jokes you're not in on. Sometimes they disappear to give you two space. If someone's told their friends about you, trust me, those friends know what's up. And they'll probably be awkward about it because humans are bad at being subtle.

* **They share vulnerable stuff with you.** Real feelings. Actual fears. Stories they don't tell everyone. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows we selectively open up to people we trust and want closer bonds with. When someone shows you their genuine self, the messy parts included, it means you've been granted access other people don't get.

* **They make future plans that include you.** ""We should check out that new restaurant."" ""You'd love this band coming to town next month."" ""Next time we hang out..."" Future tense language signals they're thinking beyond right now. They're imagining you in their future. That's not something people do casually.

Look, biology and social conditioning make us terrible at straightforward communication about attraction. We evolved to be indirect because direct rejection was literally dangerous for our ancestors. So we developed this whole system of signals and plausible deniability.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized podcasts tailored to your goals. Type in what you want to improve, like understanding attraction psychology or building confidence, and it pulls from research papers, books, and expert interviews to create custom audio content.

You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and pick voices that match your mood, including sarcastic or calm tones. The app also builds adaptive learning plans based on your unique struggles and interests. Worth checking out if you're serious about understanding human behavior patterns beyond surface level.

But real talk? If you're seeing multiple signs consistently, not just once or twice, someone probably likes you. And if you like them back, maybe just say something. Because playing detective with signals is exhausting for everyone involved.

There is a trend with modern real estate to rip out the rug throughout the house, apartments especially and replace it with trendy engineered wood vinyl flooring. In some, not even bothering to install fans. This applies to APARTMENT, CONODS, and any home where your neighbor lives above you/ under you. IF YOU SEE NEW MANUFACTURED WOOD, YOU CAN ASSUME THEY SKIPPED batting the joist bay or using QUALITY SOUND-UNERLAYMENT. You will hear EVERY step the person above you makes, it will wake you up, it will keep you from sleeping early. You will hear kids horse playing, dogs running or barking. You will hear the cat toy bouncing around the corner of a room, big foot walking down the hallway to the kitchen and back. You will learn your upstairs neighbors entire way of life, when they eat, when the kids play, when it’s relax time. Just a warning, It’s not the same as a music noise complaint, you’ll wish it was that simple. You cannot complain to your property manager that your neighbor is doing normal things and causing disruptive noise. Apartments are now rushing to make the move as a return investment project. If you do not have what it takes to take on the highest floor move and daily trek beware. The floors are paper thin, and the properties that were built with space for rugs, even thinner because of lack of foresight/ design. It’s all designed around cost, but we need to keep standard rugs in the rooms. Not just because tradition and for the bare foot experience of ‘home room’, but because it suppresses sound in the most vulnerable most important peaceful places in the dwelling. Regardless, if you value peace or are easily distracted and tuned into constant side noise like interval floor thumping and striking in your home I implore you to be very direct with your search and be willing to look elsewhere. This is roulette when you select a home that’s not on top floor at total wood floor properties. Be up front ask them for information on if there was any acoustic underlayment installed in construction. Especially if there were rugs removed. 9 times out of 10 there would have been no need for optional acoustic sound suppression in the flooring because it was built with rugs in mind originally. Be careful but particular. There is always an elsewhere with amenities and property substitute. If needed go into the property take your shoes off when viewing, you should usually be able to tell right there and then. What you hear is what you’ll hear above you

1q9g7oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyformat/comments/1q9g7oo/how_to_change_your_life_by_journaling_in_2026/,How to change your life by journaling in 2026,"Journaling creates lasting life change by helping you examine the thoughts and feelings that drive your decisions and actions. When you externalize your internal dialogue onto paper, those thoughts lose their subconscious power over you, allowing you to make intentional choices aligned with your true goals.

# Why Journaling Changes Your Life

Your outcomes stem from your actions, which stem from your decisions, which stem from your thoughts and feelings. Most people let unconscious thoughts—like fear of judgment or anxiety about failure—dictate their decisions without realizing it. When thoughts remain in your head, they run rampant and gain disproportionate power.

* Writing down a limiting belief like ""my colleagues will laugh at me if I start a business"" immediately reveals how irrational it is to let that fear block your path to financial freedom.
* Your mind optimizes for safety and survival, not growth or fulfillment, making it an unreliable tool for life planning.
* Without a journaling or meditation practice, you likely take your thoughts far too seriously, treating them as facts rather than passing mental events.
* Externalizing thoughts through writing creates the same clarity you'd get from putting a complex math equation on paper instead of solving it in your head.

# The Three Levels of Journaling

**Level One: Record What You Did**

Start by writing down what happened in your day. Use the ""Homework for Life"" technique from Matthew Dix's book *Storyworthy*: identify the most story-worthy moment from your day, even if it's mundane.

* This practice builds your journaling habit without requiring emotional vulnerability.
* Reviewing past entries lets you relive memories and see how far you've progressed.
* Even boring days contain at least one moment worth noting.

**Level Two: Explore What You Think and Feel**

Practice ""morning pages"" from Julia Cameron's *The Artist's Way* by writing three pages of whatever comes to mind each morning. Start with ""Today is going to be a great day because..."" and keep writing without judgment.

* This technique reveals negative thought patterns you weren't consciously aware of.
* Naming your feelings—anxiety, franticness, agitation—helps you understand what's driving your behavior.
* Approach your thoughts like a detective investigating where limiting beliefs originated.
* This process enhances creativity for anyone producing content or art.

**Level Three: Define Your Goals and Plans**

Once comfortable with daily reflection, use journaling to clarify what you actually want from life. Ask yourself questions like ""What would I want people to say at my funeral?"" or ""What would my ideal day look like if I achieved everything?""

* These prompts help you distinguish between what you think you want (money, status) and what you intrinsically value (freedom, teaching, service).
* Journaling creates distance from daily stress and to-do lists, allowing strategic thinking about your future.
* Understanding your true values enables decisions that align your life with what matters most.
* This clarity transforms vague desires into concrete goals, plans, and actionable systems.

# Practical Implementation Tips

**Get a physical journal** that makes you feel good about writing. Choose something aesthetically pleasing that you'll enjoy using regularly.

**Use a digital journaling app** like Day One or Apple's built-in Journal app to complement your physical practice. Digital tools make reviewing past entries easier and allow you to scan physical pages for backup.

**Start with prompts** if you're new to journaling. Access free journaling prompt lists online or ask AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to generate personalized questions.

**Leverage AI for guided journaling** by having conversations with ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools about your thoughts and goals. This provides structure for beginners.

**Build a daily habit** with 2-5 minute sessions at a coffee shop or quiet space. Consistency matters more than duration.

**Schedule deep-dive sessions** by dedicating 2-4 hours in a new location with journaling prompts and no phone distractions. These mini-retreats generate profound insights that lead to life-changing decisions.

I didn’t have a chance to reach out to chase and knew my card was locked because the next day I attempted to buy coffee and my card didn’t work. The day got busy and I wasn’t able to reach out.

The next day I got a phone call from 1-888-373-1969 but didn’t pick up. They left a voicemail telling me to call back regarding card activity on my account ending in XXXX, using the phone number on the back of my card.

I called chase back using the number on my card and was routed to the fraud department. Here’s where it got confusing and a bit weird. The rep I spoke to asked me confirm my name and phone number, and told me they’d to hang up and they’d be calling me back at the phone number I gave them.

The rep called from the 1-888 number above, and it was the same person. They asked a security question of my mothers maiden name and seemed to have knowledge of the transactions I made that were declined.

1q9g4s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/laundry/comments/1q9g4s6/my_attempt_to_summarize_what_ive_learned_from/,My attempt to summarize what I've learned from this sub & create a guide for myself,"First, want to start by acknowledging and thanking those who have made so many great contributions by sharing knowledge & helping out all the newbies like me. I replaced my washer & dryer last month and accidentally fell down the rabbit hole of this sub, I've probably spent about 10 hours reading, searching and taking notes to create a new routine to complement the arrival of the new machines. My previous routine was using whatever Tide Pods were sold at Costco, the basic/normal wash cycle and throwing everything into the dryer with a Bounce dryer sheet. For what it's worth, I've never really had any problems with the old way, meaning I didn't perceive any opportunity to improve or see any value in changing the way I've done laundry for decades.

With that said, here is a summary I put together based upon posts and comments from this sub. I would greatly appreciate any feedback, corrections, or suggestions from the community. I also have 2 questions that I would love some help with (noted at the end).

   * User Manual: For washing dress shirts/blouses, nylons, lingerie, or sheer and lacy clothes which can easily be damaged



**QUESTIONS:**

1.  My current understanding & plan is to use both 365 Sport & 365 Unscented Powder detergents for every load (except Delicates), along with using Citric Acid and a Double-Rinse cycle every time. My question: is using both the 365 Sport & the 365 Powder overkill? Are there any scenarios when I shouldn't use both or is my current plan sufficient if I'm not concerned about cost?

2.  Regarding the addition of Citric Acid, I'm unclear if I should add the powder directly into the Softener drawer or if I would be better served by mixing it into warm water first so that it dissolves? Note with the exception of Delicates, I would be using Warm water at a minimum. I couldn't find any reference or guidance in the user manual.

  
*General Notes*

**Biz** (Oxi)

* Boost cleaning, soften water, improve stain/soil removal. Contains OBAs (Optical Brighteners) and Oxygenatd Bleach
* Contains OBAs (Optical Brighteners) that can fade colored clothing over long period of time. Color determines dose and whether that oxi has Optical Brightener in it. If it’s lighter than “light navy” it gets oxi with OBA (Biz). If it’s darker than “charcoal” it gets a half dose. Can try different product for “dark oxi” loads like Febu. Darks darker than “light navy” would look better with a booster that doesn’t have OBAs.
* Application: Measure dose and place directly into drum of washer before adding clothes
   * IF wash temp are set to warm or higher, can be dispensed directly into the drums of washer. IF using cooler temp, it must be dissolved into a quart of hot tap water to unlock benefits other than softening
* Dose: 1/4 cup Biz for 50ppm hardness water (matched with 1 full cap of 360 Sport) as default load. Try 1/3 cup to see where suds level ends up (just a trace of bubbles on the glass a few minutes after agitation begins - if you see more, drop dose). Figure extra tablespoon or so for every 50ppm of hardness beyond 75

**Citric Acid**

* Balances PH, returns clothes to natural feel, odor removal benefit tied to removing excess detergent & minerals that can form sticky film,
* Application: Measure dose and place into Softener drawer of washer. Most HE machines tolerate the dry powder in the dispenser, if you find residue, then top off the dispenser with tap water after adding acid. If mixing with water, use room temperature water and dissolve the citric acid in the water, do not add the water directly into the citric acid
* Dose: 1-2 teaspoons as default, if water is hard, use more and increase by roughly 50% of base dose for every 100ppm of hardness past 150ppm

**365 Sport**

* Has DNAse boosters, good for athletic garments and heavily soiled garments, along with Lipase. 365 Powder has better surfactants. Key feature seems to be inclusion of DNAse enzyme booster. Does not contain Oxygenated Bleach
* Application: Measure dose and place directly into the Detergent drawer of washer
* Dose: 1 full cap

**365 Powder**

* Has better surfactants and additional enzymes (including Lipase) compared to 365 Sport, along with some oxygenated bleach
* Application: Measure dose and place directly in the bottom of the drum OR in the detergent dispenser IF the manual says it’s okay (for some, you may need to remove a cup or make another adjustment)
* Dose: 1/2 scoop

**Surfactants**

* Name for surface-active agents, which are the primary cleaning ingredients in detergents. Think of them as soil lifters and carriers, not stain destroyers. They are best at everyday dirt and body oils, grease and food foods, and preventing soil from reattaching. They do not chemically alter stains, they only remove what can be physically lifted

**Lipase**

* Enzyme that cuts oils from animal/vegetable sources into smaller pieces that detergent can more easily remove

**DNAse**

* Helps remove oily residues from humans and animals

**Oxygen Bleach**

* Usually means sodium percarbonate, which releases hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. Instead of lifting dirt, oxygen bleach chemically changes stains by the oxygen reaction with colored molecules in stains. It breaks their chemical bonds and makes the stain more colorless or more water-soluble, allowing the remaining residue to be washed away. It’s best at organic stains like wine, coffee, tea, grass, blood. It’s best at treating yellowing and dingy whites, removing odor-causing residues, and is color-safe on most fabrics. It is less effective on grease and heat oils by itself. It works best in warm to hot water and a long soak time improves results

**Citric Acid**

* Used for Rinse cycle, helps with fabric texture & ph, it softens and de-alkalizes. Makes towels fluffier, sheets smoother, overall a cottony-soft slightly fluffy feel

**Powders vs Liquids** \- powders are better at stain removal of physical soils like dirt and mud, liquids are better for fats and oils



**Dryer**

* Dryer Sheets: Bounce Pet Hair & Lint Guard
* Setting: Medium Heat
   * Cleaning & Maintenance
   * Clean lint trap every use
   * Clean vent ducts annually

**Washer**

* Always Use Extra Rinse Cycle (User Manual: Adds an extra rinse to the selected cycle to help remove detergent or bleach residue from fabrics. Liquid fabric softener, if used, is always dispensed in the final rinse. Pressing the Extra Rinse button twice adds two additional rinses to the cycle)
   * Cleaning & Maintenance
   * Cleaning Tablets: add directly to the drum
   * Powdered Cleaners: pull out liquid detergent cup before adding to main detergent compartment
   * Liquid Chlorine Bleach: Add to bleach compartment of detergent dispenser
   * Drum Cleaner/Lime Scale Remover: Add to main detergent compartment of detergent dispenser
   * If you use a descaled or drum cleaner during the Tub Clean cycle, use the Rinse+Spin option to rinse the washer drum before running next wash cycle
   * Frequency: Use tablets or Citric Acid at least once monthly to clean
   * Run “Tub Clean” cycle on washer
   * Wipe & disinfect seal every week
   * Leave door and drawer open to ventilate
   * Remove & clean detergent drawer once a month
   * Clean the Drain Pump Filter periodically

I’m researching cordyceps coffee and how functional beverages are being discovered in the US right now, especially through TikTok Shop vs traditional DTC.

I’m curious to hear from the community:
	•	If you’ve used cordyceps (coffee or otherwise), what actually made a difference for you?
	•	Any red flags or things you avoid when it comes to functional coffee or mushroom blends?
	•	For those who’ve watched or worked with brands on TikTok Shop — what’s real vs hype?

No links, no brand names just trying to learn from people who actually test, build, or use these products.

Appreciate any honest insights 🙏

Kind, empathetic and emotionally generous.
Family oriented with strong values and respect for boundaries.
Financially and socially, compatibility is very important to me. I come from a background that lies between middle and upper-middle class and it is essential that my partner falls within a similar or compatible standard. This is not about materialism, but about maintaining family expectations, lifestyle balance and shared realities. He should have a good, sound family background. I am specifically looking for someone from posh areas of Lahore or Islamabad only, as family standards and social alignment matter deeply in my context. I share this respectfully and without judgment. I have certain family values and standards that I must uphold.

I am looking for someone 25–28 years old, 6’0 or tall, well-groomed and confident in his presence. A beard is preferred. He should be comfortable with smoking, but I am strictly against substance or drug use. He should be jolly, light-hearted and emotionally mature… someone who enjoys laughter, doesn’t take life too heavily and values joy alongside responsibility. I am looking for a man who can be my best friend, my partner in crime and someone I can build a life with while still having fun along the way. Being family oriented, respectful and serious about commitment and marriage is essential. Someone who doesn’t get tired only after giving bare minimum, is manly enough, acts like a gentleman. 

About Me:
I am 5’3, wheatish in complexion, slightly chubby, with mid-back length hair that I am growing longer. I am family oriented, warm, and emotionally expressive. I value close family bonds, shared traditions and building a peaceful, respectful home with healthy boundaries.
I am jolly by nature, cheerful, and bring positivity into the lives of people around me. I enjoy laughter, meaningful conversations and creating comfort and ease in a relationship. I am looking for someone who matches this energy someone who enjoys life, shares humor and finds happiness in both small moments and big dreams.
I bring loyalty, affection and emotional depth into a relationship. I am supportive, nurturing, and believe in growing together as partners. I enjoy swimming, coffee outings, baking, cooking, reading and quality time. I value small gestures, consistency and intentional love.
I am not looking for perfection, I am looking for alignment. A relationship where we are best friends first, partners in everything and committed to building a loving, stable marriage rooted in trust, respect and shared joy.

\*\*\*\*\*

In May, a new young family moved into the California-style house at the end of my block, right beside the dirt road that led to a creek that fed into the Pacific Ocean.  They threw a backyard potluck and invited the entire neighborhood.

The new couple were Roxanna and Tyler Loewe, thirty-somethings from Vancouver: him, a patent attorney; her, an interior designer.  They were one of those couples who look uncomfortably like siblings, both pale and slender and round-faced, with matching dishwater-blonde hair.  Their daughter, Daisy, was six, and Roxanna was enormously pregnant with their second, a boy.  

They seemed lovely; Roxanna treated my sad attempt at fajitas like it was a rare delicacy, and she and Tyler made the rounds of the assembled neighbors with a fascinated enthusiasm I couldn’t have faked if my life depended on it.  

The Wylie family arrived a half hour into the affair; Lena in a hippie dress, Conrad in board shorts, and the girls in matching skorts and unicorn tees.  I was chatting with Roxanna Loewe when they approached, casserole dish outstretched like an offering to the gods.

“It’s Brazilian barbecue,” one of the twins said cutely, after the hand-shaking and name-exchanging.  

I was thinking Brazilian barbecue an odd choice for a dogs-and-cheetos neighborhood get-together when I noticed the look on Roxanna Loewe’s face.  By that look, you’d have thought the twin presented her with a live snake.  

“Brazilian barbecue,” Roxanna repeated, her voice a pitch too high.  “That’s… unique.”

“It was the girls’ idea,” Lena Wylie said.  “We lived there for a year, in Rio de Janiero.”  

Roxanna nodded curtly, her cheeks pale.  “Did you… have you ever lived in Vancouver?”

The Wylie parents shook their heads.  Roxanna mumbled something and excused herself, and I checked on my daughters.  I found Olivia doing handstands with Tiffany Lim and Luna Morris, and Hannah teaching little Daisy Lowe how to draw colored-pencil flowers.  

“She rotted for six whole weeks!”  Katie Liu’s shrill voice transcended the sound of polite chatter.  

I wandered over to where Katie stood, with Roxanna Loewe and Stephanie Morris, loudly regaling the new girl with the horrific details of Barbara Lewis’s death.  Stephanie noticed me first and frowned.

“I’m sorry, Becca,” she said.  “I know you were close with Barb.”

*Close* was a stretch. It was more like Barbara Lewis had been a game of chicken I’d lost.  She was confused and paralyzed and alone and I flinched first, establishing myself as the nice nurse who checked in on her a couple times a week.  I nodded forgivingly, for Stephanie’s sake.  She lived across the street, and I liked her a lot better than the other moms in the neighborhood.  

“You gotta admit, though,” Katie continued, “old Barb was an odd bird.  She barely left her house, but she… knew things.  Gossip.  Who’d lost their job, who was getting a divorce, whose kid failed algebra.  Stuff like that.”

“Remember when Nancy Koppel had cancer?”  Stephanie added.  

“She warned someone to get tested for cancer?” Roxanna asked, eyes wide.

Stephanie shook her head sadly.  “No.  Nancy was Stage One, supposedly treatable.  But Barb knew she was going to die.”

The conversation was interrupted by a loud child’s voice.  “Paolo’s Pasteria!  Get your dumplings from Paolo’s Pasteria!”  

The voice belonged to Tiffany Lim, flanked by Olivia and the Wylie twins, all carrying paper plates filled with mud pies.  

“Mama, do you want a dumpling?” Olivia asked me.  

Katie and Stephanie smiled indulgently.  Roxanna Loewe stood stock-still.  If she’d looked like she saw a ghost before, now it was as though she’d been sucker-punched.

“The dumplings are brown!” A Wylie twin chirped.  “Like the baby in your tummy.”

At that, Roxanna snapped out of her shock.  And blew up.  

With one violent motion, she knocked the plate from the Wylie twin’s hands.  “Who told you to say that, you little turd?” she shrieked.

The polite chatter around us fell silent.  Olivia ran to me; Tiffany Lim froze like a trembling statue.  Roxanna, eyes wild and ravenous, turned on her husband, who’d been conversing with a couple of the neighborhood dads.

“Are you kidding me, Tyler?” Roxanna screamed.  “Did you tell the whole neighborhood?”

“What are you talking about, Rox?” Tyler snapped, his face pale.  “I… I didn’t say anything.”

With one last glare at Tyler, Roxanna laser-focused on the next target of her ire: her little daughter.  In great, heavy bounds, Roxanna crossed the party and grabbed Daisy, roughly, by the shoulders.

“Did you tell them, Daisy?” Roxanna seethed, her tone low and dangerous.  “Did you tell your friends about Paolo’s Pasteria?”

Daisy, clearly confused and afraid, shook her little blonde head, tears in her eyes.  

“Did you tell them?” Her mother repeated, shaking her.

“No, Mommy!” Daisy wailed.  “I promise!  You’re hurting me!”

Her daughter’s plea must’ve hit the reset button in Roxanna’s squirrel brain.  She let go of Daisy, stood upright, and peered around her backyard with wide doe’s eyes.  Then, Roxanna broke.  She collapsed into a heap in the grass, bawling like a child.  

Before any of the guests could decide how to handle the situation, Tyler Loewe stepped in.  

“Thank you all for coming,” he said, kindly but firmly, “but I think it’s time to go.”

\*\*\*\*\*

The gossip found its way to me, as gossip tends to do.  

Back home in Vancouver, Tyler and Roxanna Loewe had gone through a rough patch in their marriage.  Roxanna booked a great gig, designing a hot new eatery: Paolo’s Pasteria, the latest project of Brazilian-Korean chef Jorge Kim.  Paolo’s Pasteria would feature Chef Kim’s dumplings, a favorite at his upscale Vancouver restaurant.  

The Chef and Roxanna got along well.  Too well.  

The affair went on for three months before Roxanna confessed to her husband.  They started couples’ therapy; she asked for forgiveness, he decided to give their marriage another chance, and they agreed to a fresh start in a new neighborhood.  By the time they’d settled into Chemainus and threw their backyard potluck, Roxanna’s affair had been over for a year.

Should’ve been over for a year.  

Except that one night, when she’d snuck away to Jorge Kim’s Vancouver condo to say a final goodbye.  One night.  One time.  They’d used a condom.

I was friendly with the nurses in the OB department.  And the only thing quicker-moving than neighborhood gossip is hospital gossip.

That’s how I knew about the dark-skinned, brown-eyed baby boy who’d tumbled out of Roxanna Loewe’s uterus to a confused labor and delivery team - and a pair of shocked parents.  Little baby James.  A child whose mother - based on timing, her missed period, and use of a condom - would’ve sworn in court, sworn on the Bible, sworn on her daughter’s life, that she’d been carrying her husband’s progeny, not her lover’s.  

But the Wylie twins?  They’d known.  *The dumplings are brown!  Like the baby in your tummy.*  

\*\*\*\*\*

The weirdest part of my day, though, was that Agatha and/or Aurora’s premonition about the parentage of Roxanna Loewe’s baby actually *wasn’t* the weirdest part of my day. 

The weirdest part happened as we plodded home from the Loewe’s aborted potluck.  My daughters scampered ahead and walked with Luna Morris and one of the twins.  The other twin, the one who hadn’t made the comment about Roxanna’s brown baby, hung back and matched her pace with mine. 

“Hi!” She said.  

“Hey there.”  I gave her what I hoped was a sincere smile.

The twin’s grin widened.  Her adorable kid-face was all sunshine and innocence, but something in the corners of her mouth hit all the wrong nerves.

“What’s so funny?” I asked, keeping my tone light.

The twin kept on smiling.  “You won’t like it.”

“If you don’t tell me, how do you know I won’t like it?”  I heard a desperate undertone in my own voice.

“She slept with him,” the twin said. 

I felt a trapdoor drop below me; my stomach lurched and my limbs felt too heavy.

“Who… who slept with… who?” I asked, trembling.

“Luna’s mom,” she said.  

*Stephanie Morris*.  Stephanie, my friend.

“Who did Luna’s mom sleep with?” This time, I didn’t bother hiding my desperation.

The twin giggled.  “You know who.”  

Then, she scampered off to join her sister and the others.

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I dreamed about Barbara Lewis.

I stood at her kitchen table, folding the load of her laundry I’d just washed.  Barb lay in her lounge chair, watching Wheel of Fortune.  I looked up and caught her staring directly at me.  The left side of her face still drooped, giving her a lopsided expression.  Her body was fragile and bony; her eyes big and grey, sparkling with a liveliness that juxtaposed against her corpse-like form.  

Her eyes radiated cruelty, mirth at my sad little assumption that it was *I* who pitied *her*; that my life was the desirable one.  

“Shannon Pulchaski,” Barb croaked.  “Jenica Barnes.  Lucy Wong.”

My jaw ached.  My neurons short-circuited.

“The bitch who makes lattes at Three Pines Cafe,” Barb continued.  “The dental hygienist with expensive pink scrubs.”

And then, it wasn’t Barbara Lewis sitting in that chair.  It was a Wylie twin, blonde and dimpled.  

“The little French tart who works behind the counter,” the twin chirped.

The numbness wore off.  Surging anger took its place.  The floor shook, propelled by my rage, until a fissure broke and Barbara fell down.  I heard her screams as she tumbled over and over, until she was silenced by a thud, and a snap.

\*\*\*\*\*

Lena Wylie answered the door on my third knock.  

“Becca!” She announced, with overstated pleasantness.  “What can I do for you?”

She was dressed in a hippie tunic and yoga pants, grey-streaked hair tied back in a braid.  I gave her as genuine a smile as I could manage.

“I had something I wanted to talk to you about,” I said.

Lena couldn’t hide the suspicion in her eyes.  “I was just going to put some coffee on,” she said.  “If you’d like to come in.”

Whoever had been responsible for remodeling Barbara Lewis’s place, they’d done a good job.  But the set of spiral stairs, leading to the bedrooms on the second floor, remained unchanged.  As Lena Wylie got to work on the coffee in the kitchen, I sat tentatively at the edge of a La-z-Boy.  The image of the staircase curdled something in my stomach.  

“My fellow American, right?” Lena asked from the kitchen.  “California?”

“Yeah,” I said.  

Looking away from the staircase, my eyes rested on a wooden box in the middle of the kitchen table.  While Lena was busy assembling her French press, I moved to get a better look.

“I was born in Alaska,” Lena said.  “My dad was in the Army.”

*Seeds.*  That was what was in the box on the kitchen table.  Packets of seeds.  I thumbed through tomato, cucumber, sunflower, pumpkin… and the box was tugged, roughly, away.

I flinched.  Lena stood by the table, my cup of coffee in one hand, the seed box in the other.

“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you,” Lena said, placing my coffee on the table.  “It’s just, the seeds are in a very specific order.”

I nodded and stirred the coffee.  Through a large window, I could see into the backyard.  Empty flower beds.  That moss-covered pile of rocks.  

Lena sat across from me with her own coffee.  “So, what did you want to talk about, Becca?”

“Right.”  I took a sip.  “I wondered if we could get the girls together for a play date.  Are you free this Friday?”

Lena narrowed her eyes.  “You know, Becca, I was under the impression you didn’t like me very much.”

A flutter of nerves twitched in my stomach.  I hadn’t realized I’d been that obvious about my distaste for the Wylie family.

“I… like you,” I stuttered.  “I’m just a little slow to warm up to people.”

Lena’s expression softened.  “I suppose I understand.”

“Whenever my girls make a new friend, there’s always a bit of competition,” I said.  “They’re so close in age, they always fight over who’s the friend and who’s the friend’s sister.  But since you’ve got two as well…”

“It would even the odds,” Lena said.  Her suspicious undertone dissolved.  “Friday is great.  If you want, we can take all the girls down to the Marina.  Conrad’s family has an old boat, and we’ve been dying to take it out for a spin.”

“Actually, I was thinking I could watch the girls at my house.”  I pulled a slip of glossy paper out of my purse.  “And you could have a free facial and mani-pedi at PacifiSpa.  They were handing them out at work… consider it my ‘welcome to the neighborhood’ gift.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Five days later, I stirred boxed macaroni and cheese while my daughters supposedly strung beaded necklaces with the Wylie twins in their room.

“Twist it!” A girl’s voice rang out.  “Twist it!  Twist it!”

I turned down the stove and dashed up the stairs, awash with neurosis over what the girls could possibly be twisting.  I found them gathered around the cabinet where I kept the fine china and stashed Christmas presents, Olivia trying to shove a key into the lock.

“What are you guys messing with?” I asked.

Olivia dropped her hand and stared, guiltily.  I recognized the key as one that had once opened a padlock around the side gate. 

“We’re playing Fit the Key in the Lock,” said the twin in an orange t-shirt under her jumper.  

“Well, lunch is ready,” I said.  

While the girls ate their macaroni, I pulled my house and car keys off my thick keyring and double-checked the rest.  When I’d confirmed the keys on it didn’t open or start anything dangerous, I handed the whole lanyard to Hannah.

“You guys can play with these,” I told them.  “Just stay away from Daddy’s old toolshed in the backyard.  There’s too many dangerous things in there.”

“We will, Mom,” Olivia and Hannah crooned in unison.  

The girls occupied trying to shove the key for my old bike lock into the media cabinet, I crept out the front door and to the Wylie’s house.  There were no cars in the driveway; I assumed Conrad was at work and Lena was being pampered at PacifiSpa.  They didn’t lock their side gate, so I easily slipped into their backyard.  

I hadn’t invested in a gift certificate for a mani-pedi because I particularly wanted to welcome Lena Wylie to the neighborhood.  What I wanted was access to that strange pile of rocks in the corner of their backyard.  Access, without having to explain myself.  Without having to explain that I, a thirty-something mother and professional, suspected a rock collection could reveal people’s deepest, darkest secrets.  

I sat down in front of the rock pile.  I picked up one of the smaller stones, turned it over and over in my hands.  It was coal-black and unnaturally smooth. The moss covering the pile of larger rocks was dark in color, glossy emerald, with tiny star-shaped leaves. 

I found three progressively-larger black stones and stacked them like a snowman, like I’d watched the twins do through the window.  Like Barbara Lewis had done.  Then, I took apart my stack, piece by piece.  I lay the stones next to each other.  

*This is ridiculous.*

I flipped the first stone over.

A word was scrawled across the stone, cursive, in bright red paint: *Don’t.*

A fist squeezed my heart.  I turned over the second rock, and the third.

*Don’t like you.*

Panic seized me.  I fell back onto my hands and crab-walked, putting distance between myself and the rocks and their magical red ink.  

I risked another look.  

Three flat, shiny black stones.  No red words.  Had I imagined it?

I crawled back to the rock pile.  I snatched up another three stones, turned them over to make sure I wasn’t missing anything, stacked them, then laid them out.  I took a deep breath.  I flipped the first.

*We*, in the same bright-red cursive.  

Shaking, nerves fried, I turned the others.

*We will tell.*

From somewhere in the empty air, I heard childish giggles.  The hiss of secrets whispered into eager ears.  

SLAM!

I twisted, whirled, flipped onto my knees.  The loud noise had been the Wileys’ side gate slamming shut.  The Wylie twins, Hannah, and Olivia stood on the grass.  The twins smiled angelically.  My girls had their hands in their pockets, sheepish, as though they’d been caught doing something they weren’t supposed to be doing.

“Mom?” Hannah chirped.  “What are you doing here?”

I stood awkwardly.  “Watering the grass,” I stammered.  “I told Agatha and Aurora’s mom I’d… I was looking for the sprinkler head.”

The twin in the pink shirt kicked the sprinkler head, plainly visible in the far corner of the lawn.

“It’s here,” she said condescendingly.  

*Little brat.*  “What are you guys doing?”  I asked.  

“We’re going to plant our seeds,” the twin in the orange shirt said.  She revealed she was holding the seed box her mother had wrenched from my grasp days before.  

I crossed my arms, re-establishing myself as the adult.  “I don’t think your mom wants you touching the seeds when she’s not here.”

The pink twin grinned.  “Our mom said we’re allowed.  Do you want me to call her?”

“She can thank you for watering the grass,” the orange twin chimed in.  

So much for adult authority.

“Fine,” I said.  

I perched myself in a lawn chair under the back porch.  For the next hour, I watched, numb, as the girls tore open seed packets, dug little holes, and buried the contents, then sprinkled the fertile plots with a watering can.  

I couldn’t think.  My brain glitched.

Their new garden planted, Hannah suggested to the rest that they go across the street to play with Luna Morris.  I followed the girls out of the backyard.  I didn’t want to be there anymore.  I didn’t want to think about the unnatural abomination that made red words appear on the black stones.  ",2,1768078863.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend, Ryan, is 24, and we’ve been together for almost two years. From the outside, he seemed perfect. He was charming, funny, and attentive, always knowing how to make me laugh even on my worst days. But over the past several months, I started noticing small things that didn’t feel right, little cracks that I kept trying to ignore because I didn’t want to be paranoid.

It started with the way he would disappear for hours at a time, always with some excuse that sounded plausible. “I have to work late,” he’d say, or “I’m meeting a friend,” and for months, I accepted it at face value. But then the excuses started to feel rehearsed, almost mechanical. I noticed that he would always make sure his phone was face down, and if it buzzed or rang, he would hide it immediately as though he were afraid I might see it. That small behavior gnawed at me, but I brushed it off because I wanted to trust him.

Then came the little things around my kids that I couldn’t ignore. Ryan had always been kind and patient with them, but over time, subtle behaviors started making me uneasy. He would shift when one of the kids tried to sit close to him, making excuses to get up or step away. I remember one evening when my youngest handed him a drawing; he smiled nervously, holding it too long, blushing slightly, and then quickly setting it aside as if it was too much for him. I couldn’t understand why an adult would act so awkward around children in such a strange, almost secretive way, and it left me feeling unsettled.

His phone behavior only added to my discomfort. I would catch him smiling at texts, blushing ever so slightly, sometimes even whispering or giggling softly while no one was paying attention. I tried to rationalize it as harmless, thinking maybe it was just a funny meme or a friend joking with him, but the way he carried himself made my skin crawl. He seemed absorbed in it, as if he were enjoying something he didn’t want anyone else to see.

Over time, his absences became more frequent and more suspicious. He would leave at odd times with vague explanations, and even when I asked him about it, his answers felt rehearsed. The nervousness in his voice, the slight blush when he mentioned being “busy,” all of it made me increasingly uneasy. It was a subtle pattern, easy to dismiss at first, but the more I noticed, the harder it became to ignore. My gut was screaming at me, telling me something was wrong, even when I tried to tell myself I was imagining it.

I started paying more attention to his behavior around the kids, looking for patterns, anything that could explain the unease I was feeling. He would avoid sitting near them, glance nervously when they were playing, and even when they tried to talk to him, he would smile awkwardly or blush as if caught off guard. The most disturbing thing was the giddiness he seemed to display when he looked at his phone—blushing, almost embarrassed, sometimes whispering under his breath, sometimes letting a quiet laugh escape. It was a combination of joy and secrecy that I couldn’t place, but it filled me with dread.

I tried to rationalize it. I told myself maybe he had a secret hobby or was just shy with children. I clung to any excuse because I didn’t want to admit to myself that the trust I had in him might be misplaced. But the gut feeling never went away, and every day, it grew stronger, pressing into my chest and refusing to let me relax. The fear that I was ignoring something dangerous became too loud to ignore.

One afternoon, he told me he was going out for a “quick coffee with a friend.” Normally, I might have let it go, but something in the way he said it made my stomach twist into knots. The casual tone, the slight blush on his face when he spoke—it all screamed that something was off. I realized I couldn’t just wait for him to confess; I had to know the truth for myself.

I decided to follow him. My hands shook the whole time I was driving, and my heart pounded in my chest so loudly I was afraid he might hear it. I kept my distance, careful not to be seen, as he drove through parts of town I barely recognized. Every turn, every stoplight seemed to stretch out in slow motion, building the tension until I was almost too nervous to breathe.

He parked in front of a small, unassuming apartment building and walked inside. I stayed hidden, watching from the corner of the street, my stomach twisting with fear and anticipation. Time seemed to stretch, each second heavier than the last, until I saw movement at the entrance.

A girl came out. She looked young—no older than sixteen or seventeen. My stomach dropped instantly. I felt my hands go cold and my throat tighten. The realization hit me like a punch: he wasn’t just cheating, he was involved with a minor.

Ryan’s reaction made me feel sick. The way he blushed as he saw her, the slight smile creeping across his face, the way he pulled out his phone to text her immediately, all of it screamed secrecy and delight. He wasn’t hiding it; he wasn’t ashamed. He seemed thrilled, giddy, completely absorbed in this interaction as if it were harmless fun.

I could hear his voice softly laughing, teasing her through the phone. The fragments of their conversation that reached me were enough to make my stomach turn. They were planning to meet, exchanging messages that were inappropriate, full of flirtation and secrecy. I felt as though I had been punched in the chest.

I sat there in my car, frozen, trying to process what I had just seen. Shock, disbelief, and a deep, gut-wrenching fear coursed through me all at once. The person I had trusted with my life, the man I had loved and let into my home and my heart, was capable of something so disturbing.

The mix of betrayal and fear overwhelmed me. I knew I had to act immediately, but I also needed to think clearly to protect my children. I stayed hidden long enough to be sure of what I had witnessed, then quietly drove away, my hands trembling on the wheel and my mind racing through every possible outcome.

When I got home, my heart was still hammering, my stomach in knots. My kids were playing in the living room, oblivious to what had just happened. Seeing their innocent faces made the urgency hit me even harder. I could not let Ryan anywhere near them.

I quickly packed essentials—clothes, toiletries, important documents, anything we might need—and woke the kids. I tried to stay calm, masking my panic so they wouldn’t sense the danger. I told them we were going on a little trip, a “surprise,” and they didn’t question it, which was a relief.

As we drove away, I felt a mix of panic, grief, and determination. Panic at the betrayal, grief at losing someone I loved in such a horrifying way, and determination to protect my children no matter what. Each passing street, each turn, brought a strange sense of relief that we were getting farther from danger.

Once we were safe, I called the police to report him, giving them as much information as I could. I recounted everything I had seen, from his behavior around the kids to the inappropriate interaction with the minor, to ensure that the authorities could intervene and protect her as well.

After making the call, I returned to our apartment one last time. I walked through the rooms we had shared, each space now feeling alien and toxic. On the kitchen counter, I left the divorce papers. No note, no explanation—just the papers. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of a confrontation.

The relief of leaving was immediate, but it was accompanied by a deep, gnawing grief. The trust I had placed in him, the love I had felt, the safety I had assumed, all of it had been shattered. Yet the most important thing was that my children were safe, and that thought gave me a strength I didn’t know I had.

I spent the following days trying to recover, adjusting to a new reality that felt surreal. The constant fear of encountering him again weighed on me, but the support of friends and family helped me take each day as it came.

Even now, weeks later, I replay the moments in my mind: the blush on his face, the giggle he couldn’t hide, the way he acted like it was harmless. It makes me shiver, but it also reminds me why I acted when I did.

Every time I look at my children, I feel a renewed sense of resolve. Protecting them is my priority, and nothing else matters. Ryan is a chapter I have closed, but the lessons of vigilance and trusting my instincts will stay with me forever.

I’m sharing this story here because I don’t know anyone who has experienced anything like this personally, and I need to hear from people who understand what it’s like to protect themselves and their children from someone you once loved who turned out to be dangerous.

If anyone has advice on how to process this kind of betrayal while keeping my kids safe and emotionally stable, I would appreciate hearing it.

Looking back, the signs were there all along. The little disappearances, the secretive phone behavior, the blushes, the giggles, the awkwardness around the kids—it was all there, but I didn’t know how to read it until it was too late.

I still catch myself questioning every decision, wondering if there was something I could have done sooner. But I also know that I acted when I needed to, and that I did the right thing by leaving and protecting my kids.

Every day is a balancing act between grief and relief, but I’m slowly learning to move forward. The trauma will take time to process, but at least I have safety, and that is everything.

No one should have to live through this, and I hope that by sharing my story, I can warn others to trust their instincts and act when something feels wrong, even if it’s terrifying.

I never imagined that the person I loved could be capable of such darkness, but I’ve learned that vigilance and courage are the only things that can protect the people who matter most.

# Tactical Integration: Sensory Scaffolding & Metabolic Tools

To maximize the ""Clean Signal"" during the session, it is vital to manage both internal thermogenesis and external sensory input. The goal is familiarity over novelty—providing the brain with a stable horizon so the Default Mode Network can reorganize without distraction.

**1. Sensory Anchors**

* Aromatherapy (The Olfactory North Star):
   * Eucalyptus or Peppermint: Utilize these during the ""Pre-Shield,"" the session, and the ""Landing.""
   * The Logic: Mentholated scents stimulate the trigeminal nerve, providing a ""cooling"" sensation that grounds the body when dissociative effects make physical boundaries feel fluid.
* Audio Anchors (The Frequency):
   * The Intentional Playlist: Avoid high-tempo, lyrical, or aggressive music. Opt for Bass-Heavy, Rhythmic, and Circular sounds.
   * Recommendation: Below the Bassline (Ernest Ranglin) or high-fidelity Dub/Reggae. The steady, repetitive bassline acts as a ""metronome"" for the heart and mind.
* Visual Familiarity:
   * The ""Soothing Familiar"" Strategy: If using visual media (films) during the landing, choose something you have seen dozens of times (e.g., The Big Lebowski). The lack of novelty prevents the brain from over-clocking on new information, allowing it to focus entirely on internal integration.

**2. Metabolic Heat**

* Black Coffee: Used strategically during the fast and the ""Pre-Shield"" phase. The polyphenols support autophagy, while the caffeine mobilizes fatty acids for fuel.
* The ""Fire"" Infusion: \* Ginger, Turmeric, and Cayenne: This stack is used both peri-session and during the fast.
   * The Logic: Maintains thermogenesis and systemic anti-inflammation, keeping the digestive ""fire"" moving without breaking the fasted state.

**3. The AI Co-Thinker (Real-Time Documentation)**

* The External Hard Drive: Utilize a capable AI (like Gemini) as a genuinely helpful thought partner. During the high-neuroplastic window, the ""Mind Shepherd"" often lacks the motor coordination for manual journaling.
* The Methodology: \* Use voice-to-text or brief chat prompts to ""dump"" insights, dosages, and lineage realizations in real-time.
   * The Result: The AI affirms the logic, documents data for posterity, and mirrors insights back during the ""Breakfast"" integration. This prevents ""dissociative amnesia"" and ensures the ""Software Update"" is permanently saved to the hardware.

I had one bag like 2 years ago and do remember being very impressed. It was ‘chocolate and cherry’ and that really came through in the cup.

I’ve also just looked at their website and the prices, variety and tasting notes all look insane.

Between those things, I’m strongly considering a sub.

Given their sub choices, I’d probably go for a 2x floral and 2x fruity monthly.

My question to any current subscribers is around the diversity you get each month.

If I went for a monthly sub of 2x ‘fruity’ coffees for example, would they be 2 different coffees, or 2 of the same? How often do they rotate their coffees, so how often would I be getting repeat bags (not necessarily a problem?)

Second of all, I know the ""coffee table"" looks odd and out of place, but we don't have a dining table/room for dining chairs so this is what works best for us. 

Ultimately, I've been wracking my brain for a while to try and figure out a better furniture layout for my living room. I really don't like the couch facing the door, but am struggling to figure out how to flip the seating and still make everything fit naturally. I personally think that the width of the room is too long to have the TV on the wall where the blue chair is and the couch on the wall with the shelf next to the closet (or vice versa), but am open to hearing otherwise. 

Any suggestions are welcome, I'm completely stumped but *know* there's gotta be a better layout I can use.

Bob was referred to me when I was about 2 weeks in by another member. When we first met after that meeting, he basically told me that he wasn’t my mother and that he liked to work things slow and steady. Both no problem with me.

We’ve met infrequently, often after meetings, kind of to check in and touch base. Other than that I may see him at some other meetings ( I’m going 7 days a week)but no other real communication. 

I’ve noticed at the meetings he doesn’t participate much, doesn’t really talk to anyone before or after the meeting and doesn’t ever chip in for 7th tradition but partakes freely.

My first intro to this woman is him coming home from a 12 Step meeting (we're both in recovery) talking about this ""hot girl"" at the meeting. I ended up making that meeting my homegroup, and the woman, we'll call her June, became my sponsor because she appeared to have her act together re: recovery.

Fast forward about a year, and I relapsed. June calls my partner to commiserate and they end up striking up a ""friendship."" They talk on the phone regularly, even after I get a new sponsor. 

Odd things start happening, like June wanting to meet him for coffee, and when I unexpectedly come along (my partner's suggestion, I wasn't being a weirdo), she's dressed in a short skirt with lots of makeup and seems very upset that I'm there. They talk all the time, sometimes for hours at a time. He spends money on her and her kids when we don't have money like that.

I express that this is making me uncomfortable. He says he's ""sorry"" but that he's not going to change. This goes on for 10 years. We have many discussions about this, many with me in tears.

Partner has a manic episode and breaks up with me. Two months later, guess who he's with (yes, sexually)? June, no surprise. 

Partner gets mentally healthy and wants to get back together. We work on some things, and one of those is a boundary around June. He needs to keep her at arms length. He agrees. 

Here we are 3 years later. He has talked to her on the phone every day this week. He says she's his friend, and he shouldn't have to give her up, regardless of how it makes me feel.

AITAH for wanting him to cut her off?

Note: I've left out many things that I know about June's character and past behavior that paint her in a less than favorable light because I want to see if I'm going crazy or this would be an issue in most relationships. ",6,1768077657.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False

1q9ez1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1q9ez1x/i_finally_experienced_going_all_the_back_to_base/,"I finally experienced going all the back to base (or pure) consciousness, it's weird.","Just so people understand what I'm on about, let me just quickly note down the levels of self, or depths to the meditative state.

* base self, looking through your eyes, day to day being.
* the ego, self explanatory
* the witness, or observer - the one who can look at the ego non-judgementally and the one who can watch thoughts go by in deep meditation without getting attached.
* the awareness of the witness - this one is a bit harder to explain, it'd like another step deeper, no thoughts, no nothing, it just is. The witness watches thoughts go by and says ""oh there's a thought"", whereas the awareness of the witness kind of just watches the witness without reacting.
* the light inside the awareness of the witness, this one is the strangest, this is the 'I am' state, base consciousness, buddha, christ consciousness, it has many names.

Well, I wasn't really trying to get there, but I managed to get right back to base consciousness. It's kind of cool, and a really pleasant place to be, although you can't stay there long, because as soon as you realise you're the light inside the awareness of the witness, you've objectified it, and gone back down to the witness. That's first how I knew I had got there because my mind kind of laughed at the recursiveness of the mirror looking at itself through the mirror.

To get there, or atleast, to discover it, because it's not really somewhere to get to now, it just is, I can see it.

* I just count my breath. Doesn't matter how I do it, I just need to get in that state of good focus. Brown noise, green noise, 936hz, delta waves... whatever, just not theta though because that sends me into a dream state and that's not the right place to be. You want to be calm and focused, not in the middle state of sleep and wakefulness.
* This usually takes about 20-30 minutes, sometimes longer, it might take me an hour, it might take me 2, but once the cache is cleared, and there aren't many immediate worries, I can just focus on the breath and really zone in.
* this is where I start delving into witness energy, sometimes thoughts will carry me along, and after catching myself a couple of times, I stop getting carried along, I see the thought coming, and just let it pass me by. It's like the thought comes, and before the story goes off on a speel I just go nope, can't be bothered, back to the breath.
* This is where things get deep, physically and metaphorically. After actively not getting attached to the thoughts, I can kind of just run it on autopilot. The witness watches the thoughts go by, and I just sit and watch, it's not me (by me I mean my current awareness) who isn't getting attached, i'm just kind of sat on the sidelines.
* and then... this is where it gets really weird, and at this point I've usually been meditating for 1 or 2 hours. Because all the way through this you're going up a level and down a level, and when things kind of settle you can go deeper. So here I'm consistently sat on the fence just... breathing, and I ask. Who is this sat on the fence? What is that energy? and that's where you get it.
* It is so incredibly hard to explain, because it doesn't have words, it doesn't have emotions, agendas, goals or whatever, it just is. It's kind of a physical sensation but deeper, like you have present moment awareness of oneself, but this is beyond that, it's like present moment awareness of present moment awareness.
* But like I said, you can't stay there long, because when you see it, it instantly looks back at itself and boom! You're back to being the witness.
* On that slightly contradictory note though, now I know what it looks/feels like, I can kind of glimpse it throughout the day, and it's given me a more natural congruent presence as opposed to finicky mindfulness which feels like an unruly dog that needs to be kept on a leash.

As a recovering drug addict, this is just a nice place to be. I don't have to chase anything, its so deep that trauma and egotistical desires just seem completely irrelevant. I dunno it's just cool.

Took me 16 years to get here, but I look forward to seeing how my human experience will go forth with this new perspective on life, which could be a whole nother post.

edit: as an aside, my meditative process is very unstructured for the first 15-20 minutes. If im thirsty ill get up and go get water, if im hungry ill go make a sandwhich, ill stretch off, vape, whatever, im kind of just getting things out of my system at that stage. Meditate, address something, meditate, address something, and that really facilitates deep meditation because I'm not fighting anything. And I go in to the session with the expectance that for those first 15 minutes, I'm preparing, like stretching before a workout. 

Also, if I do find myself going into theta and getting sleepy, I'll go make a coffee and drink it while I continue to meditate. Once the jitters hit, you're usually deep enough where you can disassociate from it.",4,1768077596.0,Meditation,4,0.83,False

Thoughts: This knit feels incredibly sophisticated in hand. The texture is soft and luxurious, making it a perfect piece for layering when you want to look sharp but stay warm.

Cons/Flaws: The fit is extremely slim (European sizing), so you need to size up if you aren't skinny. The wool is delicate—hand wash only or it will shrink instantly.

AMI Sweater

Thoughts: Simple execution done right. The heart embroidery is neat, and the material feels thick and cozy, nailing that Parisian casual vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The ""A"" heart logo is slightly too round at the bottom point compared to the sharp retail version. It pills (gets fuzz balls) under the arms after a few wears.

Ralph Lauren Sweater

Thoughts: A true preppy staple. The texture is soft but holds its structure well, making it great for tossing over a t-shirt or collared shirt.

Cons/Flaws: The wool blend can be itchy against the neck (needs an undershirt). Sizing runs short in the body, which might be an issue for taller people.

C.P. Company Down Jacket

Thoughts: Lightweight but surprisingly warm. The signature goggles and tech details give it that distinct look without feeling like a costume.

Cons/Flaws: The zipper hardware feels a bit ""plasticky"" and catches easily. The goggle lenses scratch very easily, so be careful when hood is down.

Patagonia Jacket

Thoughts: Functional and versatile. The insulation is strong enough for outdoor treks or just grabbing coffee. It feels rugged and ready for use.

Cons/Flaws: The sizing runs a bit boxy/wide in the midsection. There were a few loose threads on the logo patch that needed trimming.

Purple Jeans

Thoughts: These hit the sweet spot between style and comfort. The slim cut looks modern, and the stretch makes them actually wearable for long periods.

Cons/Flaws: Extremely tight in the calves—if you have athletic legs, these will be a struggle. Strong chemical smell (fufu) from the dye straight out of the bag.

Carhartt Jeans

Thoughts: Built tough. The denim feels thick and rugged, perfect for actual work or just that heavy streetwear aesthetic.

Cons/Flaws: The fabric is incredibly stiff and uncomfortable until washed multiple times. The buttonholes are sewn very tight and hard to fasten.

Ralph Lauren Shirts

Thoughts: You can't beat the classics. The cotton is crisp, the collars stay neat, and they work for literally any occasion.

Cons/Flaws: They wrinkle the second you sit down—ironing is mandatory. The fabric is on the thinner side (white is slightly sheer).

Supreme T-Shirt

Thoughts: A reliable staple. The print is clean, and the cotton is soft, giving off that effortless Supreme vibe.

Cons/Flaws: The neck collar is tight and feels a bit restrictive. The blank feels slightly thinner than older season retail tees.

Off-White Tee

Thoughts: Brings that modern streetwear edge. The design is bold, and the print finish feels high-quality and durable.

Cons/Flaws: Sizing is confusingly oversized—it fits like a tent if you don't check the chart. The large back print causes ""sweaty back"" on hot days.

Hellstar Tee

Thoughts: This tee makes a statement. The heavy cotton feels substantial, and the graphics are loud and standout.

Cons/Flaws: The graphic print is thick and rubbery (""plastisol""), making the shirt stiff in the chest area. The neck tag is scratchy.

I dropped out of college at 19 around late 2021-early 2022 and have been working a part time coffee shop job trying to save money and live with my parents figuring out what I wanna do and have been thinking about going back to Uni this year but idk why I recently have been fearing running out of time. I’ve made some great close friends and plan on traveling to Florida and Hawaii within the next year but I just feel guilty and like I’ve wasted being 18-22. I just wanted to have traveled while young, going to some clubs or even a Halloween party, scope out the dating scene, hang out with friends but I just feel like I’m too old to enjoy those things anymore. I also love gaming as a hobby in my spare time but then I feel guilty when I’m playing and have thoughts such as, Am I wasting my life away in my room? Am I too old for playing games I love with friends (ex. GTA RP, Sims, Roblox, R.E.P.O, etc)? I don’t necessarily fear getting older. I fear not making the most of being young and regretting that when I’m older. I have been spending the past month into the new year obsessing over this and I just don’t know how to remove this parasite out of my brain. I also have OCD so that probably doesn’t help either.",1,1768077160.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1q9eqpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1q9eqpc/best_walkable_mbtaaccessible_towns_between_boston/,Best walkable MBTA-accessible towns between Boston and Providence,"Hi all, I’m looking for some neighborhood/town recommendations and could use local insight.

I grew up in Rhode Island and spent a lot of time in Boston and surrounding areas growing up, but it’s been about 15 years since I’ve really lived or spent meaningful time up there. I currently live in St. Petersburg, Florida, in the Old Northeast neighborhood. It’s a very liberal, historic area with tree-lined streets, older homes, and great walkability. I can bike or walk pretty much everywhere, and I often go weeks without driving because of safe bike lanes and how accessible everything is. It honestly feels very New England-esque despite being in Florida.

I’m planning a move back to the Northeast. I’m open to Rhode Island since my family is there, but I don’t want to default to it just out of familiarity, so I’m especially interested in Massachusetts towns or neighborhoods. I work fully remote, so I don’t need to be in Boston proper and don’t feel the city prices are worth it for me, but I do want easy access to the MBTA. Ideally within 10–15 minutes of a commuter rail or T stop.

I’ll be renting and am not interested in high-rise, cookie-cutter apartment complexes. I strongly prefer older homes with character, historic neighborhoods, tree-lined streets, and a real sense of community. Walkability is very important to me. I’d love to be able to walk to groceries, coffee, gyms, yoga studios, spin classes, saunas, etc. I’m very into wellness, being active, biking, outdoor yoga when the weather’s nice, that kind of vibe.

I’m specifically looking for areas outside of Boston, ideally between Boston and Providence, so I can still easily visit family. I’m fully comfortable with New England weather and grew up with it, so that’s not a concern.

Would love any suggestions for towns or neighborhoods that might fit this. Thanks in advance.",1,1768077049.0,boston,6,0.56,False

What the hell does this even leave me with???

I’ve lost 14lbs in 2 months eating like this which is clearly not healthy. I’m overweight so this isn’t a huge deal but I CANNOT keep loosing weight at such a rapid speed. I’m just eating eggs, avocado, beef, chicken, fish, limited brown rice, sweet potato, nuts, veg and berries..  no added sugars or anything. That’s all I’ve been eating.

In all honesty it’s depressing me. Food was my joy before this happened, and I’m now dreading eating the same 3 meals. 

I miss having a sweet treat and a coffee at the end of a long day. 

I want to put everything into my recovery, but also.. this is miserable. Can anyone suggest some gluten free, sugar free (or very low), yummy snacks I can make/buy in the UK. Or actually TASTY meal ideas. I cannot eat chicken and brown rice for one more day. I miss chocolate so much lol.

1q9elai,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1q9elai/thoughts_on_recipe_tweaks/,Thoughts on recipe tweaks?,"I'm always switching my recipes. Usually not content and always searching for a better cup. Do you do this too? Is this a bad thing? Sure we all have our set recipes but the beans we buy are always changing so we can't just brew every bean the same way and expect to get the best results. 

I'll open a new bag of coffee that I've never had before (weather that be a new roaster, origin, processing method etc.) and brew using my standard recipe-will post this at the bottom.
I will drink it and take notes and most of the time I will notice a way to improve my next cup. Then my next cup I will change a variable, most of the time it's grind size or ratio but sometimes I will tweak # of pours or temperature. But then I won't like that change so I will try tweaking another variable and a lot of the time I will keep flip flopping my way through the bag.

I can't help myself. I know it's best to have a recipe or 2 and then make 1 very small change at a time if needed. Should I try to stick with that idea? Just looking for some feedback on others experiences.

Go to recipe:
Origami with Origami Cafec papers
K ultra normally between 7.0 and 9.0 adjusting 5 clicks at a time for the most part
TWW 1/2    1:16   15g-20g

Medium low agitation and keep it near 200°

The weekend before xmas I created a Hinge profile and have had several matches. I went on my first date this past week and had a phone call with another girl. The phone-call girl is pretty attractive and I feel like she is a good fit with my personality and lifestyle. Phone-call girl originally liked something on my profile and we messaged back-and-forth over the holidays. The messages were pretty shallow and slow between us so I proposed going on a date. She said she preferred a phone call first which took place this last week. The phone call lasted about 30 minutes. She warmed up to me over the course of the phone call and I eventually asked if we should meet in person and she responded something like ""yeah we could go for coffee or something may be next weekend...or something like that."" I responded ""okay, we can play it by ear."" We continued talking about various things for a while longer. Here's my question: given I am new to the dating scene after several years of being married do I text her or not? Before she liked my profile I saw her profile on Hinge's ""Standouts"" so I presume she gets a lot of attention. I don't want to play games. What gives?",0,1768076681.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I may or may not have a slightly obsessive personality, because I couldn't stop thinking that I left some meat on the bone in that last run. Specifically I thought the early part of the game could be tidied up..

.. so I did what any sane person would do, and made a list in my notes app with 100+ steps to maximise the early game.

And lo and behold, here I am, 50.000 points and 5 in-game days richer than last time..  
.. and already thinking of a few ways on how to min-max even more..

I will write some notes on those theories at the end of this post, which you can scroll down to if you're not interested in the nitty gritty run improvements - but first I *will* indulge myself by writing a wall of text about the improved early game approach.

**TOC**

1. **Early game guide to becoming OP in minimum in-game time**
   1. Early game challenges
   2. Essential priorities
   3. Day 1 step by step
   4. Day 2
   5. Day 3 and until 2nd expert in Water magic
   6. Getting learning and getting started on essential fetch quests
   7. Establishing a global beacon network before 1st level up
2. **Considerations after this play-through**
   1. Mix more black mana potions
   2. Make run harder but earn more points with XP teachers?
   3. Raw stats are useless endgame
   4. Min-maxing the early game is tricky
   5. Theoretically save 1 day by beating a genie at level 1
   6. Theoretically increase score by skipping arena trips
   7. Consider leaving sh\*t on the ground in the end game

**How you can make your level 1 party over-perform and launch yourself to an OP midgame:**

We are still playing 3 sorcs 1 druid, and in terms getting anything meaningful done in terms of combat, we have the following..

**Early game challenges:**

1. We suck in melee
2. We can't start with bows
3. Our starting spells do not get their damage buffed by hiring a mystic or spell master, and the spells that do are unsustainable with our mana puddles
4. We have low hp, so we will waste oceans of time on the Abandoned Temple fx. because we have to run a marathon to and from the temple multiple times to get it done

Meanwhile, we have some things we want to accomplish asap in order to make the entire run as efficient as possible, namely our..

**Essential priorities:**

1. Get to water expert and master ASAP so we can portal/beacon around the world and not waste days on travelling
2. Get fire expertise on everybody so we can 'Fireball' \~70% of everything that lives outside
3. Get air master on everybody so we can point blank auto-shotgun.. aherm.. I mean so we can 'Sparks' \~80% of everything that lives inside (oh and so we can get around with 'Fly'
4. Find a way to survive traps so we can secure funds for all of the above

Our steps to navigate become as follows:

**Day 1:**

https://preview.redd.it/d0ngt8hgzkcg1.png?width=1711&format=png&auto=webp&s=610190b8fc552d883961415fd02f843a7f98325a

1. Stash money in the bank and get free money from the well by the inn
2. Show the letter to Andover in the Inn, get his quest, and get the horse shoes in the stable
3. Withdraw our money from the bank again
4. Get the fly scroll from the bank wall
5. Buy every bottle/ingredient from the general store - this should be done every time we see a general store as long as we have inventory space. We need this for varying reasons as the game progresses
6. We milk the perma-luck well for all that it's worth
7. If we find a locksmith NPC, we hire them on the spot
8. Kill some Goblins and loot chests (and the rock by the sea) until Town Hall opens
9. Get Goblin Code quest from Town Hall
10. Kill goblins in a straight line to the chest with the code and bring it right back to Town Hall while they're still open.
11. Mop up landlocked goblins and mages and loot their chests
12. Make sure to get 'Merchant' on everyone and 'Disarm' on Sorc-2 when Buccaneer's opens
13. Liberate the candelabra and Angela from the Abandoned Temple.
14. If there's any time left before 2 AM, then spend it trying to get to the next place where we know there's a chest or otherwise loot. It's better to clear more of Goblin Watch here, since chests are more frequent and Goblins have money... and we only have to run a half marathon every time we get low.
15. Hit the inn as close to 2 AM as possible

A note on combat here, is that when we're deep in enemy territory, we use Static Charge and Cold Beam to kill things that can debuff us (Cobras fx.) while we might allow green goblins and yellow bats to close in and get stabbed to conserve mana.

**Day 2:**

1. Check town NPCs for a gate master. If there is one, hire them on the spot.
2. Use the fly scroll to fetch the horse shoes from the obelist island and check the riddle
3. Fetch the chest loot from Gharik's island (but don't loot the cooking pot, we don't want that smoke yet)
4. If we found a gate master, great, if not, we use the roof top teleporter to get to Dragonsands
5. We *don't* use the Shrine yet - that is for tryhards, and God forbid someone call us a tryhard, amirite?
6. Fly for our lives to Abdul's and get the gate master from there.
7. Whether we got a local New Sorpigal GM or the one from Abdul's, we ride them to Free Haven and hope to God we still have around 20k left, otherwise we're fucked.
   1. **In Free Haven, we need to do all this while 'Fly' still lasts!! :**
8. We boot our hirelings
9. We hire the local merchant and duper
10. Get Duelist's Edge membership and teach everyone the bow skill
11. Pick up horse shoes from both stables (we now have 8 horse shows = 16 free skill points)
12. We hit the well that gives a permanent boost to our puny might
13. We get water guild membership and save-scum until they have 2x Lloyd's beacon in stock, and we buy both.
14. We then cry at the state of our wallet.
15. We use 5 of our horseshoes to boost druid to lvl 4 water and buy them expert training
16. We check the bow shop for the best ranged weapons we can afford, but we need to retain \~5000 for the next couple of steps
17. We ditch our personal shoppers and round up some local craftmen to fix the Free Haven temple ruin. Our druid places a Beacon 1 at the front door, then pays for a mana refill.
18. We fetch Wilma the gate master and ride her to..
19. *White Cap*
20. We thank Wilma for the ride and tell her to go home
21. Then we shamelessly hire her colleague Mr. Harkonnen after we pick up the horse shoes outside his door.
22. Because we have not been pissing around, we use the rest of the 'Fly' duration to:
23. Say hi to Robin Hood and get his mission to ensure global warming.
24. Fly for our lives through the Harpy climate-blockade
25. Land safely in Hargreave - if our druid got cursed, we mix her a 'Restoration' potion to get rid of this condition, so she can safely place Beacon 2 here, as close to the +10 lvl fountain, as is safe with the harpies still agitated
26. Everyone drinks the kool-aid and feels 10 levels taller
27. We talk to Stone Cold Anthony and he rewards us for our proactivity and resourcefulness by admitting us into the clergy. Sweet.
28. We ride Mr. Harkonnen to..
29. *The Mist*
30. Hopefully Town Hall is still open, so we can get their quests, and then hit the General Store for all their bottles and ingredients.
31. We save scum at the water guild to make sure we purchase 'Water Walk' for our druid
32. We carve a path to Newton's pad and get his mission to drink the Bootleg Bay Powerade
33. We pick up the sailor in the back of the inn, and hitch the boat to Bootleg Bay.

**Day 3 and until 2nd water expert**

1. We water walk to the Baa medical clinic, get rid of the riff raff outside, and place Beacon 3 by the door step
2. We Beacon 2 to White Cap to get +10 levels for the day, then beacon back to Bootleg Bay. We might need some blue potions to facilitate this, due to druid's limited mana puddle.
3. We water walk to the fountain of magical powerade, slurp it up, and immediately ride Mr. Harkonnen back to The Mist, to boast about it to Newton
4. He promotes us to Wizards, greatly improving our mana puddles. This is good news, because it means we can consider using any available funds (although currently we probably don't have any) to buy some Ice Bolt spells. We them learn in priority: Druid, Sorc3, Sorc1-2. We don't bother with Fire Bolt (doesn't always hit) our Lightning Bolt (too mana intensive).
5. We boot Mr. Harkonnen, because his wages are too high.
6. We fetch the burglar who lives here, if we can't find a locksmith
7. We're not going back to The Mist until we can cast Town Portal w/o using independent contractors, so before we go anywhere else, we purge all the Baa men and cutpurses on the map. Our bows come in very handy here, since we still don't have enough mana for any significant violent expedition. We have our burglar open all the chests, but we kick her from the party before we pick up any loot or corpses, because we don't want her to get her filthy lying hands on her secret cut.
8. We ride our Beacon 3 back to Bootleg Bay. Here we heal up, pick up the Squire that lives on East Island, then we Beacon 1 to Free Haven to pick up the Weapon Master who lives out by the Moon Temple
9. We Beacon 3 back to Bootleg Bay and get started on ridding the area of any cannibalistic or reptile enemies. The tribes have to go, and so do the lizard men, and so does every enemy in the Temple Of Tsantsa, which is the only dungeon outside of New Sorpigal that we really have any chance of clearing at this level.
10. At any point during the combat in Bootleg Bay; *IF* we have enough money and can benefit from the extra beacon slots, we use the 5 horseshoes we currently have (since we got 2 in White Cap) to get Water expert on Sorc3 as well. This means we don't have to leg it so much, and since he's now a Wizard, his mana pool really lifts the workload of our Druid, who is getting sick of the taste of blue potions already
11. We also get 'Learning' on as many PCs as possible from the water guild, if we have an opportune moment and the required capital
12. If this takes enough time to threaten the expiration of our beacons, we use the Baa temple to get us enough mana to renew them. If we're feeling high on money, we can hire the mystic and spell master in Free Haven to allow us to get some extra days on the duration.

**Learning + getting started on fetch quests**

1. After delivery Tsantsa's hostage to Carlo in Free Haven, we now want to soak up every point of XP that we realistically can before we are forced to train in order to keep up with enemies in the mid game.
2. Since we're still not rich, we try to hire the merchant and duper in Free Haven every time we have to trade for something that's worth more than their fees.
3. We get 'Learning' on everyone that might not have it yet.
4. We get mind guild membership and buy 'Telekinesis'. This absolves us from wasting any skill points on the disarm trap skill, since we can remote-open most chests, and the ones that are too inconveniently places, we just tank with our +10 level power anyway.
5. We hire Wilma again and portal to Silver Cove - we boot her immediately so she can go home and get her mojo back. We need her again in a minute.
6. We get the Money quest from Loretta, we place Beacon 4 by the well that gives a temp boost to intellect and personality, and we have drinks from the two fountains in the bay that gives some permanent boosts.
7. Then we 'Fix prices' and Beacon 1 back to Free Haven
8. We 'Fix prices' in both stables here.
9. We pick up the Weapon Master in Rocklin again.
10. While we remember it, we also get the Cavalier promotion, since it's easy to forget. We waterwalk to Osric's to avoid unnecessary death by fireball from the local brigandry.
11. We hit up Wilma again. She's just gotten home and remembered that she *can* actually Portal us around more than once pr. day, as long as we pay her starter fee each time.
12. So we Beacon to New Sorpigal, kick Wilma out and place Beacon 5 by the temple
13. We 'Fix prices' here. (I write these in separate points because it's annoyingly easy to forget)
14. We pick up spirit and mind magic for our druid in the self guild - it's cheaper here than in Free Haven, and our druid can now learn that Telekinesis spell we picked up
15. We say 'how about them arrows' to any remaining enemies in Goblinwatch, as well as the Spider Queen and the other pests in the abandoned temple. If we can swing it, we pick off the mages and goblins on the shrine island and loot their chest.
16. When we feel like we can't do more here without a level up, we Beacon 4 to Silver Cove to pick up the local 'Guide' hireling
17. We then head back to Free Haven to once again bother Wilma for a ride to Blackshire
18. We 'Fix prices'
19. We then speak to Twillen about his extremely convoluted plan for rejuvenation (since we could just mix him a potion or give him a ride to Abdul's). He sends us into the world with his garden sculptures.
20. We use telekinesis to acquire Kilburn's Shield from the local Werewolves, since we in no way want to mess with them. Yet.
21. *Here we would have save scummed for a hireling for the first and only time in the game, because we need a Pathfinder and the only static one in the game lives in Paradise Valley, and we don't want to waste days walking there without one! .. but we got super lucky and found one on the street, keeping the run \*\*pristine\*\*. FeelsGoodMan.*

**Establishing the Enroth Beacon Network TM**

1. We have some walking to do. If at any point our beacons are in danger of running out, we get the mystic and spell master from Free Haven to help us refresh their duration.
2. We walk to Kriegspire in 1 day and place overwrite our New Sorpigal Beacon 5 with one here instead.
3. We keep an eye on the days here. If we hit a Saturday, then we Beacon 3 to Bootleg Bay, walk to Castle Ironfist and;
   1. Speak to Wilbur about the letter and finding Kilburn's shield
   2. Ignore Nicolai pointedly
   3. Collect horseshoes (we should now have 6 from Silver Cove, Blackshire and Ironfist)
   4. Fix prices
   5. Hopefully kill every outdoors enemy before the stable closes
   6. Hit the Arena for an eazy breezy Lord win, so we can add that to our resumé
   7. We would like to place a Beacon here, but we need them for bigger things. We could use our horseshoes for a 3rd water expert ofc., but we have those reserved for air magic and 'Fly' usage instead, so we try to wrap up the outdoors without relying on Beacons
4. Then we walk to Darkmoor and place Beacon 6 here
5. We Beacon to Kriegspire, then walk to Sweet Water
6. Since the devils aren't really patrolling this area too heavily, we raid the chest by the lake with our Telekinesis spell, hopefully getting a sweet boost to both our finances and gear
7. Then we walk all the way south and overwrite our Beacon 2 from White Cap with a new one by the temp +50 all stats fountain. From now on we drink this like morning coffee. Later in the game, our breakfast every day is this, the armor fountain by Castle Kriegspire, the 2 resistance fountains on the Eel Islands, and the +10 level fountain at Hargreave (or, when we get strong enough to kamikaze tp into the bugged drake location, the 30+ level well in Kriegspire)
8. We continue our walk to Paradise Valley and overwrite our Silver Cove Beacon 4 with a new one here.
9. *We now have instant access to everyone in Enroth except Hermit's Isle, Castle Alamos and Ironfist, via either Gate Masters or Beacons. Nice.*
10. We head to Free Haven to use 5 of our horseshoes on 'Air' mastery for sorc 1 and we use the merchant and duper (and save scumming) to secure air guild membership and a cheap 'Fly' spell book
11. We then head back to Kriegspire and Darkmoor and use Fly to:
12. Fix prices
13. Place Twillen's statues
14. Speak to the Hermit about warming the globe
15. Pick up the Darkmoor horseshoes (so we are back up to 3)
16. We also beacon to Sweet Water and Bootleg Bay respectively to place status there. Then we have to pick up Wilma again to get us to the Dragonsands teleporter in New Sorpigal, so we can once again fly for our lives, and place Twillen's last statue in Blackshire.

... Aaand we've done the hard part. We need to abuse Wilma's travel services a bit more, but we should now be able to complete:

1. Winter
2. Money
3. Twillen

This gives us a *fuckload* more XP and money than we would have gotten trying to survive most of the battles available to us at level 1. In my run, I managed this on day 12, with enough XP to get me to lvl 24.

By doing Twillen's quest instead of messing around for a 2nd arena victory, I saved 2 days on the early game and got 2 levels more, which noticeably improved my mid-game power.

[Just before 1st training](https://preview.redd.it/1yyrxnsizkcg1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac0c1a50392136b3eef9a5cc11a4a7e86ac411f)

The rest of the game is a cake walk, for reasons described in my original post. This time I felt powerful enough to do all of the wolf temple, medusa temple and warlord's fortress before the 2nd level up, which also helped me be stronger in the late game. Keeping the mystic/spell master onboard for all combat boosts your damage so much. The only rooms that felt a bit dangerous were the Superior Baa Temple's altar room and the Lava Bridge room in Gharik's (tl;dr Warlocks are a bitch).

I used Fire Blast, Poison Spray, Inferno and even good old knife fighting occasionally to spice things up, but really with Fireball, Sparks and Ice Bolt, you have the perfect spells for every combat scenario in the midgame.

**Considerations after this play-through**

* **Mix more 'Divine Magic' potions**

After feeding my entire party all the possible black perma-stat potions, I started mixing 'Divine Health' and 'Divine Magic' potions with any spare ingredients, just to have them handy in situations where I might get stupid and it might be easier to fix with a potion instead of a reload.

I should have prioritized this more, because the party does not have enough mana to quickly clear the Devil Queen's room, especially not if we're not lucky enough to find 4-6 wands of shrapmetal before making it there.

This essentially cost me the chance to finish before midnight. So there's at least 1 day's worth of improvement to find pretty easily here.

* **Score could possibly be improved by carrying Teacher/Instructor combo instead of Spell Master / Mystic**

Since score is calculated based on accumulated XP, I suppose I could maximise by carrying a teacher / instructor instead of the spell boost combo. It just feels dumb to focus on XP after the final level up, and it does make the mid- and endgame more grindy because you will require more casts and more temple-trips pr. group of enemy you're trying to clear.

A similar consideration could be made about trying to prio getting master Learning instead of some of the other skills. But idk, part of the fun for me is becoming OP, so idk if I'm interested *enough* in maximizing the score. Maybe next christmas holiday lol.

* **Stats do almost nothing in the late game**

As I was finding loot in the late game, trying to decide which rings to wear, I noticed that a lot of the +25 rings barely had any effects on fx. spell points etc.

You're *way* better off keeping rings that give 'of Air magic' or 'Of dark magic' specifically, since those two damage types are very important.

Similarly anything that gives mana or health regen and anything that is 'of recovery' is also good to have 1 of on each PC, and ofc. as many resistance items as you can find. Just remember that non-numerical boosts do not stack.

Coincidentally, this means that most of the artifacts and relics also barely really impact anything.

* **It's really hard to boost your power in the early game**

This time I tried focusing on using the Squire and Weapon Master as much as possible to boost our level 1 bow skills, but it did not feel suuuper impactful.

I wonder if it's worth prioritizing getting a third water expert instead of air, and then getting it on the wizards instead of the druid -- this way the druid could strictly be a healer until 1st training, and water experts would have extra mana available for casting ice bolts, which the spell master and psychic *would* actually boost, as opposed to the cold beam and static charges we rolled with in this run.

But then we spend more money on rehiring those two, and occasional Wind Master hirings, because our 'Fly' duration is so puny until first level up. Unless ofc. we just try to retrieve some extra horseshoes from Castle Kriegspire.. But that means contending with Minotaurs at level 1.. <shudders>

Also there's a larger problem with this, because in this run, my midgame party was already pretty overpowered in almost all situations. It's highly doubtful if getting levels beyond 24 would really make the midgame go much faster at all.

I *could* consider if I could squeeze enough xp to beat the whole game with only 1 training session. But idk. Even this min-maxed the Lich King room, Goober Room, Hive Lobby and Reactor Room are lethal. I imagine trying to do them at sub level 50 would get painful.

* **There's a possible day to be saved by not walking to Ironfist**

As someone mentioned in the replies to the other thread; the Shadow Guild HQ has portals to the Ironfist region, so it can be accessed w/o needing to waste a day on walking. But getting to those portals while level 1 seems errrh... not very feasible - and there's a lot of XP in Ironfist that we would like to get before the first level up.

* **Doing arena battles is probably detrimental to the score**

Since going to the arena takes 24 hours off the clock instantly, the added XP you get from it is *probably* not worth it in terms of the endgame score calculations. I did it because I wanted to get every single award that wasn't behind a timewall, but I'm relatively sure I would've scored better if I didn't.

* **Looting could be skipped in the endgame**

I did loot everything in the endgame, mainly trying to find rings of recovery/eclipse/troll/unicorn/resistance/gods/air-, dark, -fire magic to make sure everyone had at least one of each, but arguable gear upgrades and money at this point don't have much impact, and you're wasting time clicking corpses - and even worse - you're wasting time either dropping stuff or carrying it to the shops. I left heaps of plate armor on the floor, and I could still have saved more time if I wasn't a curious little loot goblin for sure.

The most impactful thing you can find at this point is actually wands of shrapmetal, which come in handy when you get zapped for spell points by devil kings

Anyway.. Wheew.. I think I'm done playing Might And Magic at least until next Christmas.

\- or social events that aren’t really for dating at all

More like:

\- climbing gym socials

\- casual coffee / matcha hangs

\- creative workshops / walks / games

\- meet people, talk if you want, leave if you don’t

Where dating is a byproduct, not the goal.

Questions for singles in van:

\- Would you go to something like this?

\- What would make it not cringe?

\- What would make you immediately say no?

I (25F) have been on 4 dates with a guy I met on an app (32M). First date we went for coffee and the second date we played mini golf and kissed at the end. For the 3rd date he invited me to walk a trail near his apartment and to use the hot tub there. It felt a little soon to go to his place but I trusted him so I went for it. We made out at the end which he initiated and then I told him I needed to leave. For the 4th date he invited me to his place on a weekday after work for dinner and to use the hot tub. We cooked together, went in the hot tub, and then watched an episode of a show. After it ended it was 9 pm and I told him I needed to go because I had to get up early for work and he started making out with me and tried to initiate sex. When he told me to take my shirt off I told him I really needed to go because I had to get up early for work. He said “no don’t go” but then said “I’m not gonna make you do anything you’re uncomfortable with”. To me it feels too early for me to have sex with him without any conversation about exclusivity or STI testing. He just invited me on a 5th date over at his place again. Didn’t mention any activities to do just said to come over. We met on an app and both our profiles said looking for long term relationship. Another yellow flag for me is that he made a small update to his profile after the third date, which is totally fair for him to do since we’re not exclusive but I don’t want to sleep with him if he’s actively sleeping with or dating other women. It makes me feel like maybe he wants sex with me while he looks for someone else. I think with previous guys I’ve dated I’m more used to going on dates in public and doing activities in the early stages vs just going to their place for every date. Looking for advice on what to do.

My friend was excited to get her grandma's coffee set, but her parents sent it in a flat rate mailer so not all of it made it there in one piece. Specifically two mugs and a sugar bowl broke in transit. I thought the design was berries or grapes, but she also said that the sugar bowl is like a little mug with a lid on it with an olive pattern on it, so they might be olives.

I'm sure we all have thoughts about how her parents should have shipped them, but more importantly, where can we look/what search terms can we use to complete the set?

She checked and couldn't find a maker's mark of any sort, so she thinks it might have been made by a local potter (San Diego area) and her grandma probably bought it sometime between 1950-1980.

I know a lot of us suffer from it and I’ve cracked my code for it recently and thought I’d share if anyone may have similar. 

When I started all we hear is fiber fiber fiber (among the other usual things). I was like cool, let’s do this. I added in flax in my morning coffee protein smoothie. I’d take psyllium husk because I heard it helps people go. I had the opposite issue. As I was trying harder to fix the issue, ahit just got worse. The pressure and pain, not feeling like I’ve finished or emptied out when going. 

Little bit of my background. PCOS, IBS (non constipation one where is go 7 or so times a day). I’m lactose intolerant and I’ve issues with gluten. Any diary would make me run to bathroom.. but that’s wasn’t even doing anything for me. 

So I gave chatGPT a whirl. Putting in all the shit I had going on, what i had tried. I’ve so many things here I’ve now wasted money on (live and learn). In the end the answer it gave me was anything that is fermentable was making me worse. So i stopped taking the flax, psyllium, watched the food I know that can cause bloating and pressure. Like cabbage 😭, love me some cabbage. It suggested just a stool softener that is non stimulant a day. I’ve been doing that for a week. And I’ve had no issues, no more bloating. My scale started moving again for me.
