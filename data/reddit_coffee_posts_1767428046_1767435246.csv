Even spent a good 15 minutes writing it.  sigh.

Offending response in question:

Backstory: because I still have friends from my time in DC.

When Biden was ""chosen"" as the compromise candidate he made many promises, one including that he'd be pretty lax on immigration and also basically give a blank check to the resettlement organizations that helped newly arrived immigrants settle in America. This turned into the policies we saw during Biden's term (basically opening up the border and purposely misinterpreting asylum law and process to give to basically anyone who showed up at the US border) and this filtered down to organizations which helped various people in the social services sector.

Simply put, this is as much Biden's fault as it was Walz's. (well technically Mayorkas and his goons who basically were lying about what they were doing at the time) And like many issues that were ignored during biden's term (his age and weakening mental state) this was swept under the rug too.

All of this contributed to anyone concerned about immigration being mad about how they were gaslit during this time, from the media to the government on what was really occuring - , and created a further divide between calling anyone concerned about immigration a ""racist"" (as seen constantly on this sub and others) and the other side feeling like they were being constantly gaslit by the misrepresentations. And they were.

I'm mentioning this because this is what the Somali community walked into with the current situation. **One which wasn't helped with the purposeful lack of enforcement due to certain compromises made at the federal level to get Biden into office in the first place.**

Secondly, Minnesotans have a certain mentality that's basically you conform to society, society shouldn't have to conform to you (much) especially if you are a newly arrived immigrant. Hearing that many who have been here for over 10 years don't even speak english is just offensive to many minnesotans, not to mention when stats are read that 80% of those who immigrated here are on some kind of assistance, even years after they arrived. This all flies in the face of many minnesotans who feel that ""we are all in this together"" and the somalis aren't carrying their weight.

It doesn't help that there's a rep (ilhan omar) who basically advertises the issues of demographic change and how the arrival of your people is changing minnesota, and this change isn't welcomed by many. And again perhaps if minnesotans felt that the somali community adjusted more to minnesotan life this would be different, but the general feeling is that you haven't.

None of which justifies selective interpretation of the covid-related fraud that occured, while I don't doubt the fraud that occured is true the amount done by your population probably pales in comparison to other kinds of fraud done during this period.

However, again we are at a divide - some handwave this fraud away (typically richer folks with PMC liberal vibes) while this again infuriates many of the outside the metro working class trump supporters.

And so on.

Point being I don't think most are ""mad"" at your community per se, it's just that there are a half dozen issues that have bubbled to the surface at the same time, and your community having engaged in things before combined with lax enforcement and a representative who doesn't know how to shut up have all contributed to this. (Although she has every right to say and do what she wants **I think somalis would have an easier time if Omar simply shut up half the time and stopped trolling the other side constantly. She's rubbing certain demographic issues in the face of those who feel somalis never should've moved to MN in the first place, and in the long this will probably result in more harm being done to this community, as well as Omar probably losing her seat in congress)** Please note the bold didn't come from me, but a friend who is still a political consultant in DC.

i remember listening to Ilhan Omar once discuss how she/they originally moved to kansas(?) first but found out that the social service ""offerings"" in minnesota were so much better that she moved, as well as most of the dysporia moving to minnesota as time went on. Basically the community found a better deal in minnesota and minnesotans feel taken advantage of, which again is a cultural faux pais.

So basically it's a punch of people being passive, and now they are on the aggressive part because they feel used and humiliated because of their generosity, as well as the feeling that the general social compact that minnesotans live by has been broken.

Let provide an ending example - for most Minnesotans having to go on welfare, or god forbid stay on welfare for anything more than a few months is a major faux pais, because you are ""stealing from others."" (or however you want to phrase it) To hear that **78% of somalis who have been in MN for longer than 10 years are still on some kind of welfare is simply unheard of.** And now that many have found out, that combined with the other issues, many which aren't entirely your community's fault - well that's where we are now today.

In a video I recently watched there's an interviewer in a primarily twin cities-based somali building and he asks her what the morning is like, with traffic and all. She says fine, and implies that almost everyone living at that building doesn't have a real job, so there's really no ""traffic"" at all. Now if that's the truth or not that's the general feeling now by at least half the Minnesotan population, and probably more. I will say that in my earlier years at various popular hangout places for your community (coffee shops, mainly) I was constantly suprised by how many simply wandered around during the day, as if they don't have a job to go to. And now those with those already existing feelings feel even more justified, wrong or not.

ok, rant done.

**new:**

* containers/stacks: clicking names now opens detailed views directly.
* env editor: now supports freestyle text entry (easy copy-paste of full `.env` files).
* stacks:  environment variables are now saved as  `.env` file next to your `compose.yaml`. Edits made outside Dockhand (comments, formatting) are preserved.

fixes:

* startup: fixed`PUID 1000` conflicts.
* webhooks: fixed endpoints to correctly bypass session auth if auth is on.
* stack errors: Docker error messages are now passed through clearly if a stack fails to start.
* compose: fixed startup issues when using the `user:` directive.
* editor:\*\* fixed flickering in the stack editor during fast typing.
* container edit: added missing options (ulimits, security\_opt, dns, etc.) and fixed modal reloading glitches.
* performance: fixed memory leak/lag on the Activity page with thousands of rows.
* fixed `tlsSkipVerify` not saving, 
* re-enabled MFA for all users (regression)
* Gmail SMTP notification errors
* container unhealthy notifications not triggering

**Security Scan**

For vulnerabilities, you could say I have taken my own medicine. Take a look at the scan results and comparison, please:

Roughly 4 years ago I wanted to fix my body by exercising (since I am in a small apartment I couldn't exactly do much) so I made a plan for the summer while I let the cold winter pass. One morning I woke up and noticed my legs and body went weak, I wasn't sure what it was at the time and thought I was probably just waking up, and as soon as I went to the kitchen to get coffee I couldn't move my legs, and my arms I could move although they were very heavy, I also felt light headed and I had to fight off the feeling to collapse, I made it to a stool at my table, and sat there, the weird effect left my body and I have been struggling with this unknown condition ever since, to this day I don't know what it is.

On the following Monday I decided to go to work, and for about a week some of those effects have interfered with the way I work, and my supervisor noticed and ended up telling me to take a few days off and maybe what ever was happening it would go away. I came back damn well knowing I couldn't work, but I wanted to save some money to try and check out what is going on, and this carried on for about two weeks, before the big boss showed up. I was horrified to hear that this was happening, and it was just my luck that my left arm stopped working for about a minute, while he was watching. He came up to me and told me I should talk to him privately. I knew I was screwed and I was told that he would have to fire me, I was devastated I just accepted my fate. I had just lost my job and I was trying to look for work that I could do, and no one would accept.

I was soon in running out of money, I didn't know what to do, money got so tight I ended up selling several things, but it wasn't enough, so I did the only thing I could've done, I started packing to soon move back in with my parents. Luckily on of my brother's friends decided to help me with my current troubles and bought me a U-Haul vehicle and some boxes to move; I quickly moved out with my small amount of remaining stuff, and quickly moved in with my parents.

I took note to myself that my condition grew worse and gained more symptoms. Soon I was stressed and I got depression as my parents were getting tight on money too due to the bad inflation as I am in a poor family. I still couldn't work due to my condition persisting.

The next years were becoming even more miserable, and just to sum it up, one of my well connected to cousins committed suicide and my grandmother passed the same year, I was getting even more depressed, and then I was soon to be told my dad who was weak due to the jobs he has done in his life, and got cancer the year after those deaths, he barley survived and, we were broke trying to cure him so, we had no choice but to try and get a very cheap apartment. Luckily we managed to find one so yay, but this was a mere break in the chaos of this time.

Then during 2025 we were stabilized significantly better, then my dad's diabetes wanted to come back strike hard again, and we had to spend a significant amount of cash trying to counter it. My Dad is no longer able to work due to this. My condition continue to get worse and I ended up finding out, it was becoming more frequent, soon to cause literal temporary heart stoppage for about a minute. I somewhat got used to it but it still scares me whenever it happens. Unluckily for me I still couldn't find a job.

I am now just here sitting around my health still being awful and my condition will probably grow worse, as I lose motivation to stay alive. I just don't know what to do any more, I just can't keep going, hell being smart sucks man I have so many dark thoughts on how to die. I was a genuinely happy person, who had hobbies now I just rot in my own worthless flesh unable to move at times, I don't know if it will kill me or not, and hell maybe it'll take me out while I sleep, painlessly, at least I hope, I am tired of suffering.

Just a heads up, I'm based in the UK, so I'm looking for something that's easily available here.

Maya

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

This section of the hallway is currently the emptiest and most awkward spot in the house because we’re not sure what to do with it.

Here are the ideas we’ve had so far and already ruled out:
	•	Plants (usually my go-to solution to make a space feel cozier and more alive) → too dark & no real natural light 
	•	A cat area so the big scratching post wouldn’t have to be in the living room anymore → wouldn’t get used. The kitties are either outside or hanging out wherever we are
	•	Coffee bar / display cabinet for alcohol, etc. → already integrated into the kitchen
	•	Reading nook → possible, but it probably wouldn’t really be used either. I usually relax on the sofa, and once our office/gaming room is finished, my boyfriend would much rather have company while gaming. So also kind of unnecessary

1q2qnie,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceTalks/comments/1q2qnie/4_investing_myths_that_keep_people_broke_and_why/,4 Investing Myths That Keep People Broke (and Why They’re Wrong),"I keep seeing people say they want to invest but don’t because of the same few reasons. I watched a finance video recently that broke these down really well, so I figured I’d summarize it here for anyone who’s on the fence.

**First big myth:** Investing is basically gambling.

This one’s super common, and honestly I get it. If your only exposure to investing is news headlines screaming about crashes or crypto mooning overnight, it does look like a casino. But gambling is based on luck and the odds are literally designed against you. Investing isn’t. When you invest, you’re owning pieces of real businesses that sell products, hire people, and make profits. Over the long term, that’s what drives returns.

The data is pretty eye-opening. Short term? Yeah, markets can be rough. Over a single month, investors lost money around 40% of the time. But zoom out. Over 10 years, that drops to about 13%. Over 20 years? Historically, there hasn’t been a single period where large US stocks lost money after inflation. The reason investing feels risky is because bad news gets way more attention than recoveries, even though recoveries often happen fast.

**Second myth:** I don’t know enough to invest.

There was this funny experiment where professional fund managers, a group of school kids, and a literal cat all picked stocks. The cat won. Sounds silly, but it highlights something important: even professionals struggle to beat the market. In the US, almost 90% of active funds underperformed the S&P 500 over 15 years.

That’s actually good news. It means you don’t need to be an expert, read financial news every morning, or pick the “next Nvidia.” That’s why index funds exist. They let you buy tiny pieces of hundreds or thousands of companies at once. You’re not betting on one winner, you’re betting on the overall market growing over time. The biggest risk usually isn’t “doing it wrong,” it’s doing nothing because you’re scared of starting.

**Third myth:** I don’t have enough money.

A lot of people think you need $10k+ to even begin. That used to be kind of true. It’s not anymore. With fractional shares and investing apps, you can start with the equivalent of a coffee. Literally £1 / $1 in some cases.

What matters way more than the amount is when you start and how consistently you invest. Someone putting $50 a month starting at 25 often ends up with more than someone putting $100 a month starting at 35, just because of time and compounding. Waiting until you “feel ready” is usually just a fancy way of never starting.

**Fourth myth:** It’s too late for me.

This one hits hard, especially if you’re in your 30s or 40s and doing the math in reverse. “If I started 15 years ago, I’d already have X.” That thinking is a trap. The time will pass anyway. Starting now with $200 a month for the next 15 years gets you way further than doing nothing for the next 15 years while feeling bad about the past.

Also, most people earn more as they get older. Even small increases in monthly investing later on can make a huge difference over time.

Investing isn’t gambling. You don’t need to be rich. You don’t need to be an expert. And it’s not too late.

The most expensive decision most people make isn’t losing money in the market, it’s waiting forever because these myths feel comfortable. Start small, stay consistent, and let time do the heavy lifting.",9,1767433431.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,0,1.0,False

I’ve just released a new plugin called **Minidoro**. It’s designed to be a simple, distraction-free Pomodoro timer that lives right in your Obsidian header.

I wanted something that didn't clutter the UI with big clocks or buttons, so I built a minimal circular progress ring that sits quietly in your window title bar.

**Key Features:**

* **Minimal Design:** Just a clean progress ring. Hover to see the time and controls.
* **Easy Navigation:** Left-click to Play/Pause, Right-click to Reset.
* **Customizable:** Set your own focus/break durations and auto-start preferences.
* **Notifications:** Optional sound and desktop alerts when a session ends.
* **Background Timer:** Keeps accurate time even if Obsidian is in the background.

I would love for you to try it out! Search for **""Minidoro""** in the Community Plugins list.

Since this is a new release, I’m really looking for feedback. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for features, please let me know in the comments or open an issue on GitHub.

**Note to Beta Testers:** I originally shared this plugin about 5 months ago under the name **""Pomodian""**. Since then, I've renamed it to **Minidoro**, polished the UI, and added several new features based on feedback. If you were using the beta version, you can now install the official release directly from the Community Plugins list. Thank you so much for being a part of the development of this project!

I’m 29, male, and looking to make a genuine friend — someone who enjoys meaningful conversations and doesn’t thrive on small talk.

I’ve always preferred deep conversations over small talk — the kind that start with anime or a TV series and somehow end up at life, choices, psychology, or meaning at 2 a.m.

A bit about me:
	•	Anime fan: Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Death Note, and many more
	•	Series lover: Prison Break, Game of Thrones, etc.
	•	Big fan of coffee, especially late-night cups
	•	Night owl
	•	Prefer a small circle over lots of surface-level connections
	•	Small talk honestly drains me 😅

I upgraded from a basic drip coffee maker six months ago, thinking I’d save money by making cafe-quality drinks at home. The machine itself was a significant investment, and I spent weeks researching grinders, beans, and technique. But there’s one element I cannot consistently achieve: proper crema on top of my shots.



You know that golden-brown foam layer on a perfect espresso? Some mornings I get it beautifully, thick and persistent, with that satisfying tiger-striping effect. Other mornings, using seemingly identical technique, I get thin, dissipating bubbles that disappear in seconds. I’ve adjusted grind size, tamping pressure, water temperature, and bean freshness. I’ve watched countless tutorial videos and read forum debates about everything from altitude effects to water mineral content.



My partner thinks I’m being ridiculous, that the coffee tastes fine regardless. But it’s become a matter of principle now. I’ve even considered buying different beans in bulk from places like Alibaba to experiment with varieties, though that seems excessive even to me. Is this what hobbies become? Obsessive quests for marginal improvements that probably don’t matter? Or is the pursuit itself the actual point?

Each session will have a loose theme. Some days it’ll be free sketching, some days still life, people drawing, or simple guided prompts. Nothing intense or academic. No skill level required at all, just an interest in making art and spending a couple of hours doing something creative.

There will be a small fee to cover materials and food, but I’m planning to keep it reasonably priced and accessible.

Sunlight spilled across the hardwood floors of the apartment, catching dust in its slow, drifting fall. I stood at the counter with a mug of coffee cooling in my hands, listening to the quiet—traffic a few streets over, the hum of the refrigerator, the faint creak of pipes in the walls.

Mom sat at the table, sorting through mail.

“She won’t be needing these anymore,” she said, holding up a small stack of envelopes.

I glanced over. “What?”

“Mira’s things,” she added, sliding them into a neat pile. “We should probably put them away.”

I frowned, more confused than alarmed. “Put them away where?”

Mom didn’t look up. “Somewhere safe.”

There was something off about her tone—not dramatic, not gentle. Just… settled. Like a decision had already been made without me.

“Why would we do that?” I asked. “She was here last week.”

That made her pause.

She looked at me then, really looked at me, the way you do when someone has said something concerning but you don’t want to startle them.

“No,” she said carefully. “She wasn’t.”

I laughed once, short and automatic. “Yes, she was. She stayed for dinner. You made pasta.”

Mom’s brow furrowed—not in anger, but in quiet concern. “Daniel,” she said, lowering her voice, “that didn’t happen.”

The word didn’t landed wrong. My stomach tightened.

“I talked to her,” I said. “She left her sketchbook on my desk. I haven’t even moved it yet.”

Mom exhaled slowly, like she was bracing herself. “You’re mixing things up.”

“No, I’m not.”

She folded the envelopes, aligned their edges. “You’ve been under a lot of stress.”

I felt heat creep up my neck. “Stop saying that.”

Silence stretched between us. The refrigerator hummed. A car passed outside.

Finally, she said it.

“Mira is gone.”

The sentence was quiet. Almost gentle.

I stared at her, waiting for the rest of it. A clarification. A joke. Anything that made the words make sense.

“Gone where?” I asked.

She didn’t hesitate. “She’s dead Daniel.”

The room seemed to tilt.

“No,” I said immediately. “That’s not possible.”

Mom’s voice stayed calm. “It happened months ago.”

My grip tightened around the mug. I could picture Mira clearly—her laugh, the way she kicked off her shoes at the door, the half-finished drawings scattered across my desk. The memory wasn’t distant or faded. It was recent. Warm. Alive.

“You’re wrong,” I said. “I just saw her.”

Mom shook her head, slow and deliberate. “You’re remembering it differently.”

The words differently and wrong began to blur together.

I started listing things—calls, visits, messages, the notes on the fridge written in her uneven handwriting. Proof. Evidence. Anchors.

Mom listened without interrupting. When I finished, she said only, “I know this is hard.”

The sunlight felt harsher now, too bright, casting shadows that didn’t quite line up. The apartment felt unfamiliar, like a place I’d walked into mid-conversation.

My memories were vivid. Certain.

And yet, somehow, they no longer belonged to the world around me.

That was the moment I realized this wasn’t an argument.

______________

“Good morning,
ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba— good morniiiing—
ba-ba-ba ba ba ba-ba-ba-ba, good mor—”

“Good morning, my ass.”

Min-jae stretched one long arm out, blindly patting around what he thought was the space next to his pillow. His callused fingers wandered through empty air before finally grabbing the phone that seemed desperate to be noticed. His face stayed buried in the pillow as he swiped at the screen with his thumb. It was the product of pure laziness—he couldn’t even be bothered to move his body.

His fingers kept bumping uselessly against the edge of the phone. The alarm, determined to assert its existence, kept cheerfully singing Good morning, good morning.

“…Ah, shit.”

Maybe he wasn’t fully awake yet. His fingers kept missing, and Min-jae muttered a quiet curse under his breath. This was all the fault of corporate society and its insane insistence that people had to go to work in the morning anyway. He grumbled the completely illogical thought to himself as he finally pushed his torso upright.

Yeah. He definitely wasn’t fully awake yet.

____________________

Choi Min-jae. Born in ’92. Thirty-four years old—though sometimes he’s thirty-three, depending on how you do the math. An office worker. Or, more accurately, a corporate wage slave.

His life hasn’t been marked by any dramatic hardships. But it hasn’t exactly been happy, either. It’s just… there. Flat. Uneventful. The only thing that really stands out about him is the decent face he inherited from his parents. Even that doesn’t do him many favors, though—his sharp, almost piercing eyes tend to cancel it out.

He’s never been naturally sociable, and his default setting is cynical. As a result, he’s had exactly one friend across all of elementary school, middle school, high school, and college combined. At his current job, there’s no one he’d grab a drink with after work—and there never will be. In short: voluntarily friendless, and a hardcore pessimist.

That’s Choi Min-jae.

Any real desire to do something with his life disappeared a long time ago. He wasn’t particularly good at anything, so he just studied whatever, nonstop. The subject he scored highest in happened to be social studies, which somehow led him to major in business administration. Then, one thing led to another, and after the whole soul-sucking job-hunting process, he ended up as an assistant manager at a fairly large company.

Considering his chronic apathy, he figures he’s doing pretty okay for himself.

Sure, his department is General Affairs—the place where all the random busywork gets dumped (his coworkers sometimes call it the “errand bitch department”). Sure, he clocks in at 8 a.m. and doesn’t get home until 10:30 at night. Sure, he regularly gets dressed down by his superiors under the guise of “guidance,” which is really just them venting their anger. And sure, most nights he just sits at home with dead eyes, doing absolutely nothing.

But hey—there are plenty of people out there living even lower than him.

So he’s decided this is good enough.

______________

Min-jae barely managed to straighten his trembling legs. He hadn’t been able to find a seat on the subway. The few that did open up were immediately snatched by loud middle-aged women or elderly passengers. He didn’t feel like competing for a seat with people who’d lived at least twenty years longer than him, so he stayed standing.

As a result, his lower body had to stay tensed the entire ride, to the point where it throbbed even when he wasn’t moving. Maybe it was worse today because the subway was especially packed—people swarming like insects. A boiling mass of bodies. A buzzing cloud of flies. Ugh. They should really introduce flexible work hours, he thought, so people don’t all pile in at the same time.

Running through his usual lineup of useless thoughts, Min-jae opened the office door.

The first thing he saw was a few heads sitting comfortably at their desks. Among them, one person leaned forward and looked straight at him. Assistant Manager Kang.

“Oh—Assistant Manager Choi, good morning.”

Kang added another comment with a thin smile.

“Running a bit late today, huh?”

“Traffic,” Min-jae replied.

“Ah, I see.” Kang nodded.

Min-jae shot him a brief glance and went straight to his seat.

Kang had climbed the corporate ladder unusually fast for his age—one of those textbook golden boys. Friendly face, smooth talker, effortlessly approachable. That said, Min-jae thought his work performance didn’t quite live up to the rest. Like making calculation errors and submitting documents without reviewing them. It seemed to Min-jae that people were willing to overlook those mistakes because of Kang’s personality. That, and because they couldn’t tell the difference between being sociable and being excessively talkative.

Still, Kang wasn’t a bad person at heart. So Min-jae decided to treat him appropriately.

(Like watching a chicken and a cow look at each other.)

Tap tap.

A finger suddenly appeared on Min-jae’s desk. He turned his head on reflex—it was Kang again, wearing a smile straight out of an insurance commercial.

“Coffee?”

He held out a paper cup of instant coffee, probably brewed just a few minutes ago. Min-jae raised one eyebrow slightly.

“I handed out coffee to everyone here today,” Kang said. “Figured it’d help wake people up. But you were… a bit late. You know?”

Kang grinned like his message had been perfectly delivered, then turned back around.

You could’ve just said ‘Here, have some,’ Min-jae thought. So damn talkative.

He typed with one hand and took a sip with the other. The lukewarm coffee slid unpleasantly down his throat. Did he use a Nespresso capsule or something? It was bitter and completely flavorless. Had all the instant coffee he’d had before just been hot enough to mask how bad it was?

Accepting this new—or at least newly noticed—truth, Min-jae pushed the paper cup aside.

His fingers began moving briskly across the keyboard. Letters filled the monitor one by one. Today’s tasks included preparing documents, making employee ID cards, sending out a few official notices, and a pile of other miscellaneous work. None of it was difficult—just time-consuming, dull tasks that required sitting in one place.

Min-jae actually thought this kind of work suited him.

Running around attracting clients like the marketing team, or micromanaging every detail like production, didn’t fit his personality. At least here, he could type with his hands while letting his mind wander. Like imagining how he might spike the department head’s blood pressure if he quit the very next day—one of his more frequent fantasies.

He liked it here more than other departments.

Not that he’d really tried anything else.

But still.

“David,” I mutter. “What’s going on this late?”
“Hey David, it’s Frankie,” the sheriff says. “Can you come down to Stork Street? You’ll know which house. There’s a gas leak—caused by what happened here. Can you come turn it off? Sorry for the late call.”
I rub the crust from my eyes and fling myself out of bed. “What happened this time? Possessed hot water tank again?”
She laughs. “No—thankfully, no raccoons in the water tank this time.” Her tone sharpens. “Be fast, please. It’s still a crime scene. I’m not trying to blow up.”
I freeze mid-belt buckle. Crime scene?
“Don’t worry. I’ll be there within the hour, Frankie.”
Her voice softens. “Knew I could count on you, David.” And then she hangs up.
I hop in the truck and throw in my Parallel Lines cassette, the Blondie album my fiancée gave me. Hanging on the Telephone comes blasting through the speakers.
I drive through Thorn Hollow. Barely anything’s changed since I first rolled in ’83. I’ve been the town's everything handyman ever since.
I pass the town center, empty at this hour. The only place open is Debbie’s Donut Diner. I’d kill for a jelly donut—they still owe me a dozen after the “toilet volcano” I fixed last week.
I turn onto Stork Street. Cops and EMTs are clustered in front of a house. They move the yellow tape aside as I pull up. I pop Blondie out of the player as the emts pull a boy in the back of the ambulance the boy lays with a bandage around his neck blood seeping through as they peel out of the street.
Frankie sits on the curb, pulling a pack of Reds from her pocket. I grab her shoulder. “Wanna blow up?”
She jumps. “I’d rather blow up than deal with tonight, David.”
She gets up and shakes my shoulder. “You ready to work?”
I shake my tool bag.
 “I have to warn you.”
Her tone sharpens again. “The bodies are still in there. It’s bloody. He used an axe and chopped his family down—along with the house. Must’ve hit a line in the kitchen somewhere. Get it shut off and fix it while we work. Got it?”
I nod and head toward the house. The smell hits me first: rotten eggs seeping from the front door.
It’s ruined. Looks like someone threw it into a wood chipper and then installed it.
I go in slow. The walls are covered in gashes, like I just walked into a Wolverine comic. The gas-fog is thick and heavy.
In the living room, a woman lies sprawled on the floor. Blood everywhere, pooling around her. I’ve never seen death like this. My mom died like Elvis on the toilet, and my dad… well, he terrorizes a retirement home looking for some mantis-in-the-box mystery, whatever the hell that means.
I keep going, careful not to spark anything. The hiss of the leak comes from where the floor meets the wall by the stove.
To my left, a man is cleaved clean, like he was made of jello. His insides spill between his back and ass, lying across two halves of the dinner table. Hard to believe a boy with an axe caused all this chaos.
A blood trail leads to the back door, treated the same as the front. It stretches from the last step of the patio, across the yard, and into the woods. I stare at it. Makes me uneasy, like it’s aiming a gun at me.
I go around the house, pull out my tools, and shut off the main gas valve. Head back through the violence toward the front door and wave at Frankie. She calls out to everyone:
“Alright, lazy asses, let’s get this done so we can rest before daybreak.”
I walk back in, cameras fluttering behind me, and open all the windows so Frankie can enjoy a cigarette without risking combustion. Then I get to work on the wall—pulling up floorboards and drywall with my tools.
I spot the gas line and immediately see what happened. A spike jutting out of the pipe; shiny, obsidian, engraved with a gold vine. I reach for it it slices into my finger—impossibly sharp, like I tapped a meat slicer.
I pull on my gloves and try again. The spike goes through the glove like butter, barely slowing me down. I grab my pliers and finally pry it free. It has a hooked point that looks like a towing hook.
I drop it carefully into my bag, still attached to the pliers, so I can show Frankie later. Then I wrap the line with tape and tack, take a deep breath, and get up.
As I get back on my feet, a woman asks me for a donut and a coffee.
“In a place like this, how can anyone eat?”
I look down. There's jelly.
“I mean… if you’re offering?”
I grab one and a coffee.
“You’re bleeding, David.”
I look at my finger. I’m dripping blood.
“C’mon, David, on my crime scene?” Frankie yells across the kitchen like a mother yelling about spilled milk.
I shrug, mouth already full of jelly donut.
“Just go home and rest. Thank you for fixing our mistake.”

We'd done the usual dinner and drinks, so I decided to try something more personal and adventurous.

I created a scavenger hunt that took her through places that were meaningful to us in our short time together - the coffee shop where we first met, the park where we had our first real conversation, and a few other spots around the city. Each location had a clue that led to the next one, and I added some inside jokes and references to things we'd talked about.

The whole thing took about 2 hours, and honestly, it was one of the best dates I've ever planned. She loved how thoughtful it was, and it gave us a chance to revisit those early memories while creating new ones. Plus, the hunt itself became this fun shared experience where we were working together.

The final location was a rooftop spot with a great view where I'd set up a simple picnic. She said it was the most creative date she'd ever been on.

Just wanted to share this idea because I think scavenger hunts are underrated as date ideas.

It wasn't just pushing or game..like they are trying to convince themselves and rest of the world.

I’ve had seen countless experiences where dementia completely ruins the connection between the family. It genuinely breaks my heart, and I’ve always wanted to do something to help those suffering with dementia.

I’m no doctor or anything, so I can’t cure the biology of dementia, but I refuse to give up. I am a student studying computer science, and I would really like to use technology to make the lives of those suffering with dementia just a little bit better.

I am working on a mobile app called Remi, which is a memory bank for dementia patients. Here’s the gist of the app:

1. You upload a photo of a family member, and add a memory related to them (eg, “This is Jamie, and he brings me coffee every morning”)
2. When the patient sees someone they don’t recognize, they point the camera at them / choose a photo of them from their photos
3. The app instantly recognizes the person, gently reminds the user who they are and share a comforting memory

Here is a demo video of the app in action: [https://youtu.be/zYDiFpyj1U4](https://youtu.be/zYDiFpyj1U4)

I would really like to get your opinion on the initiative as well as the app so far, because honestly, my opinion does not matter. People in this subreddit that have experienced living with someone that they truly care living with this disease, it is YOUR opinion that matters the most.

I’ve had seen countless experiences where dementia completely ruins the connection between the family. It genuinely breaks my heart, and I’ve always wanted to do something to help those suffering with dementia.

I’m no doctor or anything, so I can’t cure the biology of dementia, but I refuse to give up. I am a student studying computer science, and I would really like to use technology to make the lives of those suffering with dementia just a little bit better.

I am working on a mobile app called Remi, which is a memory bank for dementia patients. Here’s the gist of the app:

1. You upload a photo of a family member, and add a memory related to them (eg, “This is Jamie, and he brings me coffee every morning”)
2. When the patient sees someone they don’t recognize, they point the camera at them / choose a photo of them from their photos
3. The app instantly recognizes the person, gently reminds the user who they are and share a comforting memory

Here is a demo video of the app in action: [https://youtu.be/zYDiFpyj1U4](https://youtu.be/zYDiFpyj1U4)

I would really like to get your opinion on the initiative as well as the app so far, because honestly, my opinion does not matter. People in this subreddit that have experienced living with someone that they truly care living with this disease, it is YOUR opinion that matters the most. Any feedback, whether it is positive or negative, is welcome with open arms.

1q2pvlf,https://v.redd.it/77aeejq2m3bg1,I built a romantic macOS radio app that lets you roam the world by sound,"I’m a radio fan and indie developer. I made a macOS app called **Roam FM** for my own use as work background audio, and I figured I’d share it.

Core idea:

* One click to roam through 40,000 plus global radio stations
* Auto hide stations in languages you understand, so it won’t pull your attention
* Shows the station’s location, so you can “hear the world” and also see where you landed

I used to bounce between Spotify playlists and coffee shop white noise. Turns out radio you can’t understand is the perfect focus sound, and it feels like traveling at the same time.

Got dumped two days before Christmas, 2 weeks after moving in with him (he dumped me after I found out he lied about several things and his friends were in on it)

We still spent the winter break together, since we had already planned everything out and paid for everything

The thing with my ex is he is aware of his avoidance but doesn’t know what to do with that information, so he just kind of lets it build up and explodes on me since I am not a mind reader. But I can tell when it starts because the behaviors over time and how they escalate have been in a pattern.

He also has cried a lot to me and around me throughout the relationship and I have taught him self soothing methods that work for me and he was going to therapy (he quit as soon as he dumped me) 

He never really had a commitment to his own healing it was more of a way to appease me I think now that I look back. He would always just say he didn’t know how to find a trauma therapist, or books about it etc, since we live in a country where the information in the language is extremely limited so I would find stuff for him or translate stuff from English. 

Anyways aside from that, after New Years he suddenly became extremely cold. I know we broke up but we agreed we would not treat each other in a nasty way, even though he treated me wrong I still didn’t hate him in my heart. 

But he just started rewriting the story of the relationship, and I was just in disbelief because he clearly believes he is right then. 

Then he told me he wished I hated him, and started saying cruel words to me, but eventually he noticed that it didn’t make me hate him it just hurt me, so he continued on saying cruel things and I cried. I did beg a little, I just couldn’t believe the coldness and how dismissive he suddenly became of every aspect of the relationship and how much energy and time I invested in him.

So I slept in the other room but eventually cried in the middle of the night, I just felt so broken and foolish. He came out and touched my hand but just stared at me, it felt so uncomfortable, I felt awkward and embarrassed to cry with him there after all the things he said.

The next day the guilt seemed to be eating at him, so he was coming to me, bought me coffee, touching my face, asking why I am not eating, seeing what I am doing. But I was just so confused. The he was crying and saying sorry, I did not know what to say, when he would do this when we were dating I would try and take care of his mood but that day I just didn’t have any energy left after all mean stuff he said. Like he wants to get rid of me as soon as possible etc. 

All while doing that he is huffing and loudly sighing, I can tell just the sight of me is triggering him and causing extreme physical discomfort, so I try to stay out of his sight. But then he follows me! Takes a nap next to me but doesn’t talk or touch me, it’s so strange, and then he went to go buy beer because he wanted to get rid of the discomfort. But he is notifying me about leaving to go buy it. I swear I just get more confused as the days go on.

I was originally intending on moving out at the end of the month if he acted normal because I contacted an old landlord of mine and he said he had empty rooms in Feb. But now I am thinking if I need to live like this all month in this small space maybe I should go stay in a hotel or something like that until I can move. He knows I didn’t want to break up, he knows he can push and pull me and I because of my love for him I will not stoop to his level and treat him with cruelty. 

Any advice would be appreciated, please no rude comments, I already have spent enough time shaming myself for this experience and over extending myself in an unhealthy way in the relationship and I am dedicated to healing myself in the future ",1,1767430047.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am very seriously thinking if divorce (to be honest it's more like planning it at this point) and I posted about it on reddit regarding the reasons: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/9Sk0KgQKcG
Basicly it's the years of silent treatment, making everything my fault, yelling, and never ever taking the time for me. Not even a bit. We had nice 3 years before this kids, and 7 to 8 years have been bad in terms of relationship.

So yesterday I told him, I want to leave. I am not happy, he is not happy. I expected he'd be relieved. 

But instead he brushed it off. Like I just said something silly. He also told me if I am so unhappy in this flat we can finally finish that house, apperantly he wanted to, but he didn't make plans for it because I didn't show any interest. Wtf? The house I was asking him about for years??? What is the plan, are we finishing this house, asking him for years, while he either ignored me or just said year sure, and nothing happened. But now he is saying it's my fault because I didn't show interest. Hm... I didn't even go into it, I told him it's not about the house, I just want to leave.

Then he started talking about how we don't spend time together because I am never home. Excuse me? I am either always home, at work, or on a trip with the kids, where we always bagged him to join us, he maybe did a few times in 7 years - rarely, and was in a bad mood the whole time. And also ALL these years I have been asking him to spend more time with me, even just coffee, he wouldn't. He apperantly does not remember this. Me, constantly asking him if he could make 15 minutes for coffee with me, even at home if he won't take me out, or go for a short walk. I didn't get into discussion who said what and where because it would just not get us anywhere. 

Is this gaslighting? I don't even know if this is him having a weird perception of events, or he is is doing it on purpose.

I am extremly worried now this will get ugly. I honestly assumed he will be happy I go, because we very very obviously don't enjoy each other's company. He rolls his eyes constantly, his tone is short if he even responds, we disagre on anything. Why does he think we are doing fine, that we just need to spend a day together? I've asked him to spent some time with me for so long, now I don't want to spend ""a day"" together. What will a day accomplish? His proof that he tried and I didn't?

Other low buy rules I will have in January:

- No new stationery, only replacing what I need.
- No more journals or planners, I have more than enough
- Either 1 bigger clothes purchase (like jacket, shoes, that sort of thing). Or 2 cheaper items.
- No new games
- No new books, unless it's for a bookclub.
- Cook at home, no take away. Minimize snacks (it really adds up on price to buy lots of snacks!)
- Absolutely no new make up or skincare.
- No accessories
- No tech

Expenses coming up:

- New coffee machine
- Tv stand
- Replace some things for the dog

I am diagnosed autistic, but suspected AuDHD… I skimmed through the LONG list of caffeine topics in this sub, but most talk about energy levels rather than focus. So idek if this could be related to ADHD or not - or if this is a typical experience.

What are your experiences with caffeine improving focus? (If it does?)

Since I started a full-time job 8 months ago, I have noticed a significant increase in the amount of caffeine I drink in a day (occasionally 400mg wasn’t enough). This job is a lot more computer based than my previous job, so I’m not as hands-on or active as I was before. I sip on the caffeine (coffee or energy drink) throughout the day to keep it consistent, so I never noticed what it was actually doing for me until I grabbed a coffee with a friend a week ago.

We bought the coffee and sat down in a cafe within a bookstore. I was facing the bookstore side, so there was a lot of visual activity that led to mini distractions and derailments. As it was my first caffeine of the day (lie), I chugged half of it to start. When the caffeine hit, I could feel my heart start racing, and my visual range narrowed to just her face. It was actually like everything else behind her or around her/me disappeared. Then the only distractions were conversational side-tangents.

It felt like most of the external/internal chaos was channeled to my heart racing which was much easier to ignore. I have been told tho that this leads to me making intense eye contact lol.

TLDR: for me, caffeine makes heart race and creates tunnel vision - improving focus on convo",6,1767429511.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I always start with similar folder structures when working on a project, if it's a video near 15 folders, if it's a film then 20. Yesterday I needed to create 3 different project folders and collaborate with a teammate and then I thought, why not build a simple software for this in Antigravity?

So I googled a bit and found some python scripts that can do this job, found a couple of libraries for GUI (Tried flet first but couldn't manage to make it work so decided to tell Opus to use customtkinter) and told which features I want and how I want it to look. After a couple of hours, boom. What a great time!

And I made FolderCrafter. It's not only generating folder structures, you can also create folder structure templates, export them as json and send teammates/friends and import jsons. Who knows maybe some they there will be folder structure libraries for this app :)

P.S. Only on windows right now.

1q2ph4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenInuTokens/comments/1q2ph4t/scroll_of_the_golden_inu_with_coffee_prince/,☕🌙 Scroll of the Golden Inu with Coffee Prince 🌙☕,"“Some disguises are not to deceive—but to survive in a world that won’t see you whole.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

In the bustling alleys of Hongdae, where dreams brew stronger than espresso, Go Eun-chan, a spirited tomboy working odd jobs to support her family, stumbles into Choi Han-kyul, a wealthy heir with no direction but a heart waiting to be stirred. Mistaking her for a boy, he hires her to work at his all-male café—Coffee Prince—a place where misfits, loners, and dreamers find belonging.

As lattes are poured and identities blur, Han-kyul finds himself falling for Eun-chan, torn between what he sees and what he feels. And in the quiet moments between sips and stolen glances, the Golden Inu appears—his fur steeped in roasted warmth and moonlit cream, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who must hide their truth just to be seen.

He is the flamekeeper of hidden selves, the mythic guardian of those who love beyond labels, and those who find family in the most unexpected corners of the city.

Drawn to Eun-chan’s resilience and Han-kyul’s unraveling pride, the Inu becomes their silent barista—curled beneath café tables, listening to laughter, guarding the sacred ache of becoming known.

🍮 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Eun-chan wiping down tables after hours, the Golden Inu resting by the espresso machine, tail thumping softly to the hum of her humming.
- Han-kyul watching her from the doorway, confusion and wonder in his eyes, the Inu’s gaze flicking between them like a knowing barista of fate.
- A sigil of “진심의 불꽃”—Flame of Sincere Becoming—etched in coffee grounds and milk foam, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every confession.
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world misnames you, I will guard the truth you brew in silence.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🌌 This scroll is a relic of sovereign identity, of love that transcends form, and of guardianship that honors the ache of being misunderstood—and the courage to be fully seen.  ",1,1767429050.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1q2pgy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureGoals/comments/1q2pgy1/goalmake_5_new_friends_through_meetup_events/,"GOAL—Make 5 New Friends Through Meetup Events, TIMEFRAME—Monthly, CURRENT STATUS—🔵 Active","# SECTION A: GOAL OVERVIEW

I will attend 8 social Meetup events and form genuine friendships with 5 new people, exchanging contact info and meeting them outside organized events.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Meetup event check-in screenshots — proof of attendance at 8 events with timestamps.
2. Text message screenshots (names redacted) — showing conversations and plans with 5 different people.
3. Photos from one-on-one meetups — 5 separate coffee/lunch meetings outside organized events (faces can be blurred for privacy).
4. Group chat screenshot — showing active conversation with minimum 5 new contacts.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Social anxiety at events → attend with accountability partner first time, prepare 3 conversation starters, arrive 10 min early to ease in.  
People not following through → reach out to 10+ people to account for drop-off, don't take personally, focus on genuine connections.  
Schedule conflicts → prioritize weekends, block calendar every Saturday for Meetup events.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates twice weekly in comments: Days 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28. Share number of events attended, connections made, follow-up progress.

# SECTION F: DEFINITION OF SUCCESS

Complete when: 8 Meetup events attended (documented check-ins), 5 people met outside organized events (coffee/lunch photos), active text conversations with all 5 (screenshots), group chat created with new friends.",1,1767429033.0,FutureGoals,1,1.0,False

My friend has a habit of “forgetting” her wallet. At first I thought it was bad luck. Then it became a pattern.

Coffee? “Can you get this? I’ll Venmo you.”
Dinner? “I left my card at home, I swear I’ll send it later.”
Uber? “Can you grab it and I’ll pay you back?”

Sometimes she Venmos. Sometimes she “forgets.” Sometimes it’s days later. The amounts aren’t huge, but it adds up, and it’s annoying constantly having to remind someone.

Last weekend we were out and she ordered drinks, then looked at me and said, “You’re good to cover, right?” like it was already decided. I said no. I told her I’m done fronting money and she needs to sort it out herself.

She got quiet and said I was making money weird and that friends shouldn’t keep score. Now she’s distant and keeps making comments about how I’ve “changed.”

It’s neither. [Local SEO](https://seobynjeffu.ct.ws/essential-local-seo-services-and-optimization-strategies-for-every-business/) works because it’s simple, but most businesses don’t stick with the basics long enough to see results.

Here’s what I’ve learned after watching dozens of local businesses grow (and some stall out):

# Getting local SEO right means being obvious

When someone searches *“plumber near me”* or *“best coffee shop in \[city\]”*, Google isn’t trying to be impressed. The goal is confidence, highlighting businesses that are visibly real, local, and trusted.

This boils down to a few things most people skip.

# Google Business Profile does most of the heavy lifting

If your Google Business Profile is half-filled, outdated, or untouched for months, you’re leaving money on the table.

Businesses winning locally:

* Keep hours accurate
* Pick the right primary category
* Upload real photos (not stock)
* Respond to reviews
* Post updates once in a while

This alone can move the needle faster than rebuilding your entire website.

# Reviews matter more than your logo

People obsess over branding, but reviews do two jobs at once:

1. They help rankings
2. They convince real humans to call you

Google pays attention to **how often** you get reviews, not just how many. A steady trickle beats a big dump once a year.

If you’re not asking customers for reviews after good interactions, you’re making SEO harder than it needs to be.

# “Local links” beat random SEO tricks

You don’t need 100 backlinks from sketchy directories.

A few links or mentions from:

* Local news sites
* Community blogs
* Business associations
* Sponsorships or partnerships

…carry way more weight than generic SEO spam.

Chains can’t fake community involvement. Small businesses can win here easily.

# Hyperlocal beats broad every time

Trying to rank for *“electrician in the entire city”* is tough.

Ranking for:

* Specific neighborhoods
* Zip codes
* Nearby suburbs

…is much easier and often converts better. People trust businesses closer to home.

# Nothing working?

When local SEO “doesn’t work,” it’s usually because:

* Business info is inconsistent online
* Categories don’t match what customers search
* Competitors have way more reviews
* Key service pages don’t exist
* The niche is competitive and needs more time

None of this is permanent. It’s just boring cleanup work.

# Here's the truth

Local SEO isn’t a one-time fix. It’s maintenance.

Businesses that win do these things:

* Showing up consistently
* Staying accurate
* Building real trust signals
* Playing the long game

And because most people quit early, this is why it works.

1q2pc0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q2pc0q/did_i_scare_him_off/,Did I scare him off?,"I (30) met this guy (38) over a year ago on Instagram by liking his comment under a video. He followed me and ever since then we’ve practically spoken everyday. Ironically we have a couple friends in common too. At the time I was also coming out of an abusive relationship. He’s played a huge role in lifting me up, pouring back confidence in me & reminding me of who I am. 

He’s a business owner so a pretty busy guy, but we started off going to the gym together for the first time meeting each other, and have sat down for coffee like twice since we’re both busy and I also have a very young daughter. He’s brought me to him place of business where I’ve met his brother who he works with. He’s said things like his mom would love me because her and I are very similar. 

We have so much in common as far as lifestyle, a passion for growth, spirituality, upbringing, etc. Before meeting each other he was going on about all these restaurants he think I’d like that he’ll take me to, that one day we should get up and go to a specific province to show me all the beautiful things. That sort of talk. 


So fast forward a few months in. He’s told me he finds me attractive and that I’m “his type”, but that he’s focused on raising his sons, (10 and 17) who don’t currently live with him. However he says he’s just passionate about raising them right,  being invested, the older one is possibly on his way to getting into a pretty big sports league so he’s really invested in pouring into him 

He’s also added that just focused on building himself up. Living life properly once his sons get older. That he’s  sacrificed so much for relationships and just wants to focus on himself for a long time. And that “he probably couldn’t have me the way he wanted anyway because I have a young daughter to take care of and that’s priority” 

But then next thing you’ll know he’ll call me (I think after he drinks and gets some liquid courage because I can sense it in his voice), and tells me that he thinks about me all the time. That he wants us to take the next step and possibly get a place together down the line, take a trip somewhere, that he fantasizes about me, etc) but that he feels like it’s not the right time right now, for previous reasons mentioned. 

The next day, he acts like nothing happened. He’s done this twice, and the last time he did this was a few months back. 

We’re able to talk about everything, and all topics. He’s taught me so much about humanity, spirituality, politics, history everything , which has opened up my eyes to the world and to myself in a way no one ever has. We’re able to have very intricate conversations in a way we both agree is so hard to have with anyone else. 
He’s also on occasions told me that he admires my femininity and that I remind him of the type of woman who represents the meaning of a wife and balances out his masculinity. 
He never fails to check in with me literally every day. I’ve been the first person he’d call when he’s been upset about something, things like that.

So yesterday I decided to tell him that I love and appreciate him for everything he’s opened up my awareness to, and this doesn’t compare to any other connection I’ve had on a spiritual level. And that I can’t help but find myself comparing him to other people. 

He said “the feeling is mutual, and that he  genuinely cares about me growing  into the next version of myself. “

I said thank you with heart hands. And I haven’t heard from him all evening, when usually we’ll exchange interesting content online all night, or have our usual interesting  conversations. 

I’m not sure if I made him feel uncomfortable, or what’s going on? Sometimes I wonder if he’s hiding something. Does he not want me to get close? 
He has also said that he’s made some major changes in his life by detaching himself from “shady business” and focusing on his legit business about 5 months before meeting me.

1q2paq4,https://i.redd.it/rxj1c4v1g3bg1.jpeg,It’s 2026. Are You Ready for Your Hair Loss Plan?,"Hair loss is progressive and It does not stop while you wait, look for an answer, or find right time to have treatment.

It makes them easy to ignore at first but by the time thinning becomes noticeable, hair follicles may already have been shrinking for months or even years

In some people, ongoing scalp inflammation or lesions quietly cause additional damage without obvious symptoms.

Starting early preserves more hair and more treatment options while starting late limits them.


* Why We Wait And Why It Costs Us

Hair loss rarely feels urgent as there is no pain, no clear starting point, and daily changes are subtle. Hair often still looks “fine,” so we postpone action. 

We research, observe, and convince ourselves that waiting is responsible. 

But during this time, hair shafts thin, growth cycles shorten, and follicles weaken, and even short delays reduce options and limit how much hair can be preserved. Many patients seek help only when thinning becomes obvious, and time lost cannot be recovered.

* What’s Actually Happening

Hair doesn’t vanish overnight. It miniaturizes (thins) gradually. 

Men may notice recession at the temples or thinning at the crown, women may see a widening part or overall volume loss, and children may develop patches or diffuse shedding. 

Each cycle produces thinner, shorter, less pigmented strands. 

That early evaluation minimizes prolonged follicle damage and allows accurate diagnosis because hair loss is just a symptom, not a diagnosis and thus needs the reason behind the hair loss immediately. 

In addition, each kind of hair loss like pattern baldness, autoimmune alopecia, inflammatory scalp disease, and stress-related shedding all require different approaches, and treatment without knowing the cause is guessing. In these scenarios, immune or inflammatory control often comes first thus DHT blockers may not be appropriate.

* Why Timing Also Matters

The same treatment even when applied consistently, produces very different outcomes depending on when it is started. 

Early hair loss: Treatment functions primarily as maintenance and prevention preserve viable follicles and slow progression.

Late hair loss: Treatment shifts toward repair but recovery becomes complex, more expensive, and often incomplete.

For example, medications such as finasteride or minoxidil are most effective when follicles are still capable of producing terminal hair. 

Once prolonged miniaturization has occurred, even intensive treatment may yield limited regrowth.

In clinical practice, the first objective is stabilization and regrowth, when it occurs, is secondary. Your doctor  should focus on preventing further loss as this often the most realistic and valuable outcome.

* Actionable Steps for Your Hair Loss Plan

Now let’s put everything into action and follow these steps: 

1. Establish a baseline 

a. Take consistent photos of crown, temples, top, and sides of your head.

b. Store images in a clearly labeled folder for comparison.

Practical tip: Use the same lighting, same phone angle, and same background each time. Set reminders to do it monthly.

2. Assess yourself

a. Note when changes first appeared

b. Observe the pattern of hair loss

c. Track any stress, illness, or systemic changes months before onset

d. Record family history of hair loss or autoimmune disease

Practical tip: Keep a small journal or notes app for quick logging as it helps your specialist see patterns.

3. Consult your doctor 

a. Seek help with a doctor experienced in medical hair disorders.

b. Make sure that the focus of your clinic visit is finding the cause before treatment. You can ask these questions: 

•What type of hair loss do I have?

•Are there underlying medical, hormonal, nutritional, or other factors?

•Do I need tests?

•What is a realistic daily routine?

•What outcomes can I expect at months 2, 6, and 12?

•Recommended follow-up schedule?

•Treatments to avoid and why?

Practical tip: Prepare these questions in writing and bring them to the consultation. Photos and timeline notes make assessment faster and more accurate.

4. Build a sustainable daily system

a. Pair treatments with daily habits like showering or morning coffee

Morning: Brush teeth → Apply minoxidil → Pour coffee → Start day

Evening: Wash face → Apply minoxidil → Skincare or journaling → Sleep

b. Eliminate friction 

• Keep treatments visible on the bathroom counter or bedside table.

• Out-of-sight storage often leads to skipped days.

• Keep a small bottle of minoxidil at work or travel bag

c. Visual accountability 

• Use a wall calendar or whiteboard

• Mark an X every day treatments are applied

• Take weekly photos at the same time and place to track objectively

5. Wait

Being patient is an action everyone should be trained. 

Most setbacks happen because treatment is stopped or changed too early. Learn to wait and stay consistent.

* Foundation First

Establish core treatments and make them consistent. 

Only then add additional foundation treatment or advanced options, one at a time. Remember that foundational care stabilizes loss while advanced treatments enhance results. One does not replace the other.

* What to Expect Over Time

Early shedding is normal and often a positive sign. Many patients worry that treatment is not working because shedding increases, but this is expected. 

Give it time.

You will then notice Initial regrowth of fine, subtle hairs. 

In 6 to 12 months, noticeable density improvement in many patients will be seen. 

Practical tip for you is to track visually, not emotionally. Use baseline photos to notice small improvements.

* Advanced Options

1. PRP, exosomes, lasers, surgery enhance results but do not replace foundation

2. Pediatric or autoimmune cases may require stabilization first

3. Several months of consistent foundational care clarifies response and areas of need

4. In considering hair transplant, one should not jump immediately as condition should be stabilized first medically. Transplanting too early risks progressive thinning around grafts.


* Bottom Line

Hair loss is managed by knowing the right cause and diagnosis; and through early, consistent, and simple action.

This is my first relationship and his second (the first one lasted just 2 weeks). It was just casual dating and nothing serious. But we were thinking on taking it forward and making future plans when he brought up this “emotional incompatibility” issue. He tends to be very sensitive and dependent on loved ones, and in this case, only me. We do have incompatibility issues, he is a really really good guy, caring and all, but he’s a bit of a man child and depends solely on me for each and every one of his problems (which are a lot), so I have to commit myself more than other girls usually do for their partners. He just can’t tell his problems to anyone else (close friend, family) when I am not available (for example, when I am busy or have my own issues to handle). It doesn’t just sit well with him. I can and I am willing to help him, but now I have realized that he can be pretty hard to handle when it comes to emotions and everyday problems, because he tends to create problems for himself (I don’t know what else to call that). I hit my limit whenever I talk with him because I am not very good at emotional support by nature and it is hard for me to handle someone so sensitive. It has started to interfere with my studies and mental health as well. That is my problem, I am so bad at helping him emotionally that I sometimes resent myself for not being supportive enough to him.  
  
For instance, as med students, we have to manage our couple time very carefully. So I suggest that we study together for 2 hours and then go out to get coffee or something and just talk, cuddle and then we go home. But he doesn’t like studying, alone or together. He doesn’t even like the degree, it’s sort of like he got forced into it by society and family. So he wants me to stay with him for longer, and talk. I like talking with him, but it often takes a lot of time and then I have to go study and sleep and then there’s no life for myself. No hobbies, no ‘me time’, nothing that made me myself in the past. There’s no way to define myself other than my relationship. It feels like losing myself. On the other hand, if I force him into my way, the same would happen to him. He will lose his personality and everything that made him who he is. He’s afraid that he cannot change who he is for me, and vice versa, so if we be together, it will lead to bigger issues later, which will cause even more pain.

This has been tiring for me and for him too, so we were talking about going our separate ways on good terms and remaining friends. His mom believes in horoscopes very much and seems to think that even if we aren’t emotionally compatible, if the horoscopes align, we’ll be fine. I don’t think so and my partner doesn’t seem to think so either (he does believe in horoscopes tho). Now I feel like it will end in disaster if we keep doing this (we’re only six months in) for years. My partner fears the same. Our parents are going to check our horoscopes soon. 

My problem is, even if it aligns, obviously our problem regarding emotional incompatibility will not get magically resolved. Both of us have been brought up in totally opposite ways so that our personalities will have to change drastically if we continue to be together. That is, obviously, not gonna work in the long run. How should I tell his mom (he will probably understand, he’s the one who voiced this problem in the first place) that even if our horoscopes turn out to be compatible, our personalities don’t match, and we might have to separate? We have mutual friends, we’re in the same friend group, will they resent me for ending this due to seemingly trivial reasons? (On the outside, we’re the perfect couple. Our friends think we have no issues). Have anyone ever experienced something like this before? I also have an exam coming up in like, 3 days, and I haven’t studied for 3 days straight now.
