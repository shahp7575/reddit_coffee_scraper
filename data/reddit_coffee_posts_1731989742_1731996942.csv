An ergonomic office chair is not just a fancy piece of furniture; it can be a game-changer for your workspace. Imagine spending hours sitting in a chair that feels like a warm hug instead of a medieval torture device! With the rise of remote work and long hours at a desk, understanding the importance of ergonomics has never been more crucial. In this article, we’ll explore what makes an office chair ergonomic, its benefits for your health, and how to choose the perfect one for your needs. Sit tight—pun intended!
  
  
## Understanding Ergonomics

Let’s talk about ergonomics, shall we? It's one of those fancy words that sounds like it belongs in a science lab, but really, it’s just about making life—especially sitting life—less of a pain in the back. Literally. Ergonomics is all about designing things to fit humans, not the other way around. And trust me, when it comes to office chairs, this principle is nothing short of life-saving.

Think about it: ever sat in one of those cheap plastic chairs for hours? The kind where your spine starts screaming halfway through your Zoom call? That, my friend, is the definition of bad ergonomics. On the flip side, an ergonomic chair is like a thoughtful friend who just _gets_ you. It adjusts to your height, supports your lumbar region, and even tilts just right so you’re not hunched over like a modern-day Quasimodo.

The magic of ergonomic design lies in its principles: _adjustability_, _support_, and _comfort_. Your chair should let you tweak it like a DJ—raise it, lower it, lean back a bit—until it feels just right. And don't overlook the materials! A breathable mesh backrest or a well-padded seat can mean the difference between an ""okay"" workday and one where you don’t dread getting up.

I learned this the hard way. My first desk chair was a second-hand relic that looked more decorative than functional. After a week of sitting, my lower back felt like I’d been wrestling alligators. Once I switched to a proper ergonomic chair? Game-changer. My productivity shot up, and my chiropractor might’ve cried a little.

So, why does this matter? Because in a world where sitting is basically a full-time job, your chair isn’t just a piece of furniture—it’s an investment in your health. Why settle for a bad chair when your back deserves better?

## The Anatomy of an Ergonomic Chair

The first time I heard about ergonomic chairs, I thought it was just fancy marketing for overpriced office furniture. Then, one day, after hours hunched over a desk chair that could have doubled as medieval torture equipment, my back finally staged a rebellion. That’s when I started digging into what makes a chair “ergonomic” and, more importantly, why it matters.

An ergonomic chair isn’t just a cushy seat. It’s a carefully engineered throne for your spine. The standout features? Adjustability, lumbar support, and seat depth. Let’s break that down.

First, _adjustability_ is king. If a chair doesn’t adapt to you, it’s doing you a disservice. You can tweak the height, armrests, and even the backrest tilt to match your body’s unique quirks. No two people are built alike—some of us are tall and lanky, while others (like me) are short with a tendency to sit cross-legged even when it’s wildly inappropriate. An adjustable chair lets you get the angle and height just right so you’re not slouching or craning.

Then, there’s _lumbar support_. Oh, what a game-changer! A good ergonomic chair cradles that curve in your lower back like a supportive hug. It keeps your spine aligned and prevents that dreaded “c-shaped” slouch, which we all know is the gateway to back pain.

Finally, _seat depth_ is something I didn’t even realize was a thing until I tried a chair that felt like it was designed for a giant. Your thighs should rest comfortably on the seat without the edge digging into the back of your knees. Most ergonomic chairs let you slide the seat forward or backward to get that sweet spot.

When I was picking my chair, I became borderline obsessed with these features. I sat in so many chairs at the store, the salesperson started calling me “Goldilocks.” My priority was lumbar support since my lower back was practically screaming for mercy by the end of every workday. I also learned that too-deep seats are a nightmare if you’re on the shorter side. Trust me, nothing kills focus faster than feeling like a kid dangling in a too-big chair.

Choosing the right ergonomic chair is like finding the perfect pair of jeans. You’ll know when it fits because suddenly, you’re comfortable in ways you didn’t even know were possible.

## Why Comfort Matters

I used to think a chair was just a chair. You sit on it, it holds you up, end of story. But oh, how naive I was! When I started working full-time from home, I quickly learned that not all chairs are created equal. The hard truth? That dining chair I’d been borrowing was about as supportive as a potato chip under a brick. My lower back was staging a mutiny, and my productivity? Let’s just say it went on an extended coffee break.

That’s when I discovered the miracle of ergonomic office chairs. These aren’t just fancy seats with a higher price tag. Oh no, they’re a revelation. An ergonomic chair is designed to support your body in all the right places—lumbar spine, neck, even your wrists (I’m looking at you, armrests!). It adjusts to your body, not the other way around, and encourages proper posture, which, let’s face it, most of us forgot existed after grade school.

What makes it ergonomic, you ask? It’s the little details. Adjustable seat height so your feet are flat on the floor. Lumbar support that feels like a hug for your back. A tilt function so you’re not rigid as a board all day. Trust me, it’s like the chair is rooting for you to succeed. And once you sit on one, you’ll wonder why you ever settled for less.

## Choosing the Right Ergonomic Chair for You

Let me tell you, finding the right ergonomic office chair feels a bit like dating. You think you’ve found “the one,” only to sit down and realize, nope, your back’s still screaming by noon. Here’s the deal: not all ergonomic chairs are created equal, and choosing the right one is part science, part art, and a whole lot of trial and error. 

First off, **size matters**—and I don’t just mean for your chair, but for _you_. A chair that fits your coworker like a glove might feel like a medieval torture device to you. Look for adjustable seat height and depth. You want your feet flat on the floor, knees at a 90-degree angle, and a couple of inches between the edge of the seat and the back of your knees. It’s like Goldilocks—too tall or too short, and you’re in for some serious discomfort. 

And let’s not forget about lumbar support. _Oh, lumbar support!_ I once bought a chair that promised “premium back support” only to discover the cushion felt like someone had stuffed a rolled-up sock into the backrest. Test the curve—it should match the natural curve of your spine. No gimmicks, just good, solid support. 

Finally, always—_always_—try before you buy. Trust me, no amount of five-star reviews can replace sitting in that chair for ten minutes and deciding if your tush approves. If you can’t test it in person, check return policies. Your back deserves it.

## Maintaining Proper Posture

Let me tell you something I learned the hard way: slouching is not just a ""look,"" it's a lifestyle. And trust me, it’s a terrible one. For years, I thought I could pull off the casual ""hunched over a laptop at my dining table"" vibe. It wasn’t long before my back decided to stage a full-on revolt. What started as a minor twinge eventually became a symphony of discomfort. That’s when I realized the importance of proper posture—and how an ergonomic chair isn’t just a chair, it’s a lifeline.

Maintaining good posture while sitting in an ergonomic chair might sound like common sense, but let me assure you, it’s more of an art form. First, let your chair work for you. Adjust the height so your feet rest flat on the floor (or on a footrest if you’re on the shorter side, like me). Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle—no dangling legs or pretzel positions, okay?

Now, here’s a practical tip I learned after weeks of trial and error: align your back with the chair’s lumbar support. If your chair doesn’t have proper lumbar support, grab a small cushion or roll up a towel. I promise your lower back will thank you. And don’t forget your arms—they should rest comfortably on armrests, parallel to your desk, not flailing in midair like a bad sitcom gag.

I also learned to position my screen at eye level, which meant stacking books under my monitor for a while (pro tip: dictionaries work best). And speaking of the screen, it should be about an arm’s length away to avoid the dreaded ""tech neck."" Combine all this with regular breaks—yes, standing up counts as exercise—and you’ll be surprised how quickly your body feels the difference.

To this day, I still catch myself slipping into old habits. But now, instead of ignoring it, I straighten up and adjust my setup. My back doesn’t protest nearly as much anymore, and for that, I am eternally grateful.

## The Long-Term Benefits of Ergonomic Chairs

The beauty of an ergonomic office chair lies in its design, which feels like it’s whispering to your body, “Relax, I’ve got this.” It’s not just a fancy seat with adjustable knobs—it’s a thoughtful invention crafted to pamper your spine, hips, and every inch of your posture. But what makes a chair truly ""ergonomic""? Well, let’s unpack that. 

First, it’s all about adjustability. An ergonomic chair practically begs you to tailor it to your specific needs. Seat height? Adjustable. Armrests? Adjustable. Lumbar support? You guessed it—adjustable. It’s like having a personal tailor for your chair, only this tailor ensures your back doesn’t scream at you halfway through a workday. 

Then there’s the magical lumbar support. I didn’t think much of it until I sat in one and felt my lower back say, ""Ah, finally."" It’s designed to maintain the natural curve of your spine, unlike those flat-backed torture devices some call chairs. 

And let’s not forget the seat cushion. Good ergonomic chairs have just the right firmness—not too hard like a park bench, not too soft like your grandma’s overstuffed couch. This matters, folks. Prolonged sitting on a poorly designed chair can cut off circulation or leave you shifting every five minutes like you’re auditioning for a restless leg contest. 

Lastly, they swivel! It’s not just fun (though it is); it’s functional. Being able to pivot reduces strain when reaching for your coffee or grabbing files. Honestly, why settle for less when your body deserves better?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, investing in an ergonomic office chair is like giving your back a well-deserved vacation. With the right chair, you can avoid pesky aches, boost your productivity, and feel more comfortable during your long work hours. Remember, your chair should support you, not fight against you! So, whether you’re a student, a remote worker, or simply someone who spends a lot of time sitting, consider upgrading to an ergonomic option. Your spine will thank you, and who knows? You might even enjoy your work a bit more!",1,1731996605.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

I always believe that Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does. But as the title goes, you never hurt the person you love (used to) even it breaks you from the core.

It looks easy but definitely hard, when you feel betrayed and never in the world you would imagine that the people you expect would protect you are the ones who ruined you in every possible ways.  I think the rule of the thumb is very simple.
When there are more tears than smiles, leave. When there are more fights than jokes, leave. When it hurts more than it feels good, leave. They don't have the right to destroy you just because you love them. And loving them doesn't mean you have to stay.

There will be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change you.
Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder instead. But don't you go and become someone that you're not. Cry if you must. Scream if you have to. But never let your emotions eat you up, do something stupid and regret it afterwards.

I'm slowly learning that even I react, it won't change anything, it won't make people suddenly love and respect me, it won't magically change their minds. Sometimes It's better to just let things be, let people go, don't fight for closure, don't ask for explanations, don't chase answers and don't expect people to understand where you're coming from. Life  is better lived when you don't center it on what's happening around you and center it on what's happening inside you instead.

I am slowly learning how to forgive the past. How to accept that sometimes beautiful things end, that sometimes the timing isn't right, that sometimes the messiness of life gets in the way. I am slowly learning that endings aren't something to be upset about, but rather, I am slowly learning how to appreciate how damn lucky I was to experience something real and hopeful and light in a world that sometimes fails to be soft.
I am slowly learning how to be alone. I am slowly learning how to wake up in the middle of the bed. How to make just one cup of coffee in the mornings. How to hold my own heart, how to take up my own space. I am slowly learning how to stop filling voids with other human beings, and instead, I am slowly learning how to confront the void itself. How to heal it.

The following days won't be easy but we have to realize that, Genuine love is when someone hurts you, but because you care about that person so much you choose not to hurt them in return. Hence, Love doesn't hurt but loving the wrong person does..

1guqnd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1guqnd2/some_rules_of_online_dating_based_on_my/,Some rules of Online Dating based on my experience (38F),"I am a 38F woman who has been single for a long time.  I had a lot of situationships and have been looking for a committed relationship through online dating. After a lot of red flag men in my life I learned to be a lot more selective in who I chose to spend time with. I had a lot of first dates that never went anywhere, talked to some sketchy or flaky men and met a few nice guys who I just didn’t feel a spark with. But, I was starting to feel discouraged. However, I stuck with it. 

Although online dating often sucks and is a lot of work, all that time spent was worth it for me in the end. I actually met an amazing guy! After 2 months of great dates, he became my boyfriend officially and I think things are going super well! Don’t give up ladies. I know it is rough out there but keep going on those dates - there are some good ones out there! 🙂

I didn’t want to waste my time…so these were my rules of online dating. Take it or leave it:

1. Weed out a lot of men based on their initial profile and don’t match with people who are clearly not looking for a relationship (if that is what you want). For me - they needed good pics, shared interests, a decent bio, effort in their profile, interest in a relationship, and no overtly sexual images or responses. 

2. Don’t chat for too long before setting up a first meet. I would suggest 1 or 2 days chatting to make sure there are no glaring red flags and they seem like someone you would want to meet. I’ve waited too long before, only to find out it was a catfish situation. Just meet them @before you invest too much time on someone you aren’t attracted to!

3. Do not bail on the first meet if you can help it, even if you don’t feel like it - just commit and follow through. It is a turn off when people bail, and guys often loose interest if you do. And honestly, I do too if they bail. Communicate the day of the date to avoid ghosting. 

4. Make the first date location somewhere you feel safe and that is convenient for you. It should be something public, cheap and easy to end quickly if you need it to. Think - coffee or a beer at a brewery. Guys will appreciate this too, no point in asking him to pay for a lot on a first date. But, he should be able to afford one drink. If you are vibing - you can suggest one more, getting some food or extending the date in some way. If you aren’t interested, you can say thanks and peace out.

5. After the date, be honest after about how you feel. Do you want to see them again? If not - say sorry I wasn’t feeling it and move on to the next. 

6. Trust your gut. Your intuition goes a long way. If something felt off trust yourself. 

7. Be smart, be safe! Don’t send personal info, sexy pics or be pressured to do anything you don’t want to do. If this happens - screenshot, block, report. 

8. Once you start to chat with someone, be consistent with messaging them. It can be overwhelming talking to too many guys at once. I picked about 2 to respond to at a time. Once I had either eliminated them or met them and decided I wasn’t interested - I would pick the next 2 in my inbox. I found I had better luck when I waited to start chatting with guys, then when start talking and became overwhelmed and dissapeared. I had a life outside of online dating, and could only focus on maintaining one or two convos at a time. 

Hope that helps some of you. Please share any other advice you may have too. This list worked for me but I am sure there are lots of other things that can be added. You got this peeps 💕 best of luck out there!",2,1731996462.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It got to the point where my doctor prescribed me dexamphetamine (7.5mg twice daily), which initially helped. However, even though my focus improved, I often felt a bit fatigued especially towards the end of the day. Over time, the effectiveness has started to fade a little, so I added a single espresso in the morning, which gave me a little boost.

Recently, my doctor suggested trying Methylene Blue. I’m currently trialing it at a dose of about 15mg per day. Almost immediately, I noticed something unusual – I no longer felt the urge for coffee or other stimulants. The desire to have that ""kick"" was gone. I felt super calm, any lingering anxiety seemed to vanish, and my mind was incredibly clear. What’s more interesting is that this clarity wasn’t accompanied by the typical ""buzz"" of being energized; it just felt natural, like a baseline normal state. I also noticed my urine turned blue at this point.

However, after a few days, I realized I was missing the motivation I typically got from coffee or dex. So, I decided to try having a coffee and taking a dose of dexamphetamine. To my surprise, neither seemed to affect me at all – no stimulation, no energy boost, nothing. It feels like stimulants have completely stopped working for me.

To add another layer to this, a few days later, I noticed my urine had returned to its normal color. This change has left me wondering about the implications or reasoning behind it. Does the color shift indicate something about Methylene Blue being metabolized differently in my system, or is it a sign of something else entirely?

So, I have two main questions for anyone who’s experienced this or has knowledge about it:

1. Has anyone else found that Methylene Blue diminishes or blocks the effects of stimulants like dexamphetamine or caffeine? Any theories on why this might happen?

(Lily POV)
The rest of the drive to the pack house was eerily silent.
After my father and I arrived at the pack house, my father quickly exited the vehicle and headed to his office, leaving me on my own. I timidly and cautiously entered the beta suite, but I was relieved to find that my mother was already in bed. I decided to go directly to my room and try to sleep as well.
Unfortunately, I ended up tossing and turning all night. The look on my father's face when talking to the guards continued to haunt me. When I did sleep, I had nightmares. Strangely, Rose seemed restless too, but other than briefly wishing me a happy birthday after it hit midnight, she did not say anything.
I think the main thing that provoked my nightmares and kept me up was that my heart ached for my father. I knew that I wanted to help him with his pain and ease his suffering, but I was not sure what I could do or say to make things better. It has already been six years. If time has not helped heal his heart, what could I do? The truth is, I am not Stephanie and I never will be. The only thing I have ever known how to do for my father is to try to stay out of his way.
At least for my mother, I can serve as a literal punching bag to help her relieve her grief. And for others in the pack, I can serve as both a literal and metaphorical punching bag. But, I am nothing to my father: my father has neglected me and ignored the abuse I suffer from others, but he has never directly participated in any of abuse.
Perhaps that is one reason his pain upsets me more than the pain of everyone else. He is the least awful amongst my current tormentors, and I can sometimes lie to myself that he does not know or agree with how much I have suffered.
I know that it probably seems strange that my heart aches for him at all, given that he is someone who, for the most part, could care less about me. However, please understand that for my own sanity, I have chosen to remember and hold on to the good times in my childhood.
Of course, there is also the fact that... regardless of how my father currently feels about me... I have always been --and will probably always be-- a daddy's girl. It is just part of who I am.
Since I was in diapers, I have looked up to my father and considered him to be my superhero. Before Stephanie died, I never saw an ounce of weakness in him. He was my strength and my rock. I always had an strong desire to make him proud of me. He was always the first one I ran to when I got a good grade on a test, or when I drew a picture I thought he might like.
And ...before Stephanie died... he was always the first one to dry my tears when I got hurt or to give me reassuring praise when I felt down. Even though I knew Stephanie was his favorite... even though I knew Stephanie's accomplishments would always be greater, and that he would always be more proud of her... those little things mattered to me. I lived for those moments.
Sigh.
By 5:30 am, I gave up on any hope of further sleep. Stephanie's first remembrance event was not scheduled until 11 am, so I knew I had a little bit of time. Eager to take advantage of that time and also avoid my mother, I took a quick shower, packed a small backpack, and headed out of the house.
Predictably, my feet led me to the waterfall that I had shifted in front of six years ago. I have come here at least twice a year since Stephanie died, usually on her birthday and death anniversary. The waterfall brings me an odd sense of peace. As beautiful as it is, I do not know anyone else who comes here. Perhaps that is why I like it so much.
I found a flat rock and sat down. I then took a legal pad of paper and a pen out of my backpack.
It probably sounds weird, but I am not always sure if the Moon Goddess can hear me when I pray to her silently in my head. So, about seven years ago, I began writing down my prayers. Once I am done writing them, I will seal them, kiss the paper, and then burn the prayer with a silent wish that the Moon Goddess pays attention. I do not know whether praying this way actually makes a difference, but it does make me feel better.
Wiping a few tears from my eyes, I began writing.
Dear Moon Goddess,
Here I am, back at the pack once again. Today marks six years since Stephanie died. I know that I have asked you for a lot over the years, and you have usually provided... although not always in the ways that I expected.
James and most of the pack still believe that I am the reason that Stephanie died. For years, I have dreamed about everyone finding out the truth about what happened that night... but I have never dared to ask you to help make that a reality.
In fact, I have never even talked to you about what happened that night.
I suspect you know why I have avoided the subject.
The truth is, I have been a coward. I have told myself over and over again that James spread baseless rumors and that I did nothing wrong.
I did not want to face the possibility that maybe, just maybe, everyone is right and Stephanie's death was my fault. Today, however, I am willing to face the truth.
I never should have prayed that you stop Stephanie from continuing to hurt me. I realize that now.
Please know that I never would have asked you for to stop her if I knew it would mean the end of her life. I would have just continued to deal with it. Please, if you are with her, tell her that I am sorry.
I accept that what has happened to me since she died has been a way of punishing me, and I understand. The problem is that I am not the only one being punished.
I do not know how many more times that I can watch my father break down in tears because he misses Stephanie so much. My father never did anything to deserve this.
I may not have been Stephanie's biggest fan, and I may think that this pack has lost its mind half the time, but there is no denying that Stephanie was loved and valued.
If there is a way to turn back time, I beg you to ignore my prayer that day... or to at least take me instead of Stephanie.
If that is not possible, I beg you to accept my apology for my wrongdoings and help bring peace and happiness back to this pack. Please especially help my father and my family find peace. Please help the pack move on to bigger and greater things. Hell, even though I do not like him, I ask that you please even bring James a new mate who will love him and appreciate him in a way Stephanie never could.
It is time for the pack to move on... even if that means moving on without me.
If you will honor these requests, I will do everything in my power to be the best she-wolf that I can be. Rose tells me that we are special, and that we have a unique destiny in front of us. I am willing to follow that destiny wherever you want it to lead us... but please, do not let anyone else suffer any more because of me.
With love,
Lily
As I seal the letter, kiss it, and prepare to burn it, Rose speaks to me in the link. ""You know that you sound a little crazy in that letter. What happened to the strong human I have been living with the last several years, who knows that Stephanie's death was Stephanie's fault and only Stephanie's fault?""
I sighed. ""It is easy to tell myself that when I am away from the pack and not having to deal with the consequences. It is a lot harder to believe that I am blameless when everyone around me is crying and upset all the time. You saw my dad last night. That nearly broke me. He is still hurting so much.""
""That does not make any of it your fault,"" Rose protests.
""Rose, the day before Stephanie died, I prayed that the Moon Goddess stop Stephanie from continuing to hurt me.""
""She was not hurting you, Lily. She was torturing you. There is nothing wrong with you praying that it stop.""
""There is if it cost Stephanie her life.""
""Lily, you are not giving the Moon Goddess enough credit. You are smarter and stronger than this. You need to stop with the emotional vomit and ---""
Suddenly Rose stops talking through the link. She is pacing back in forth in my head. I have no idea what is going on, until the overwhelming scent of vanilla and coffee beans hits my nose.
""Mate! Lily, our mate is here! Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate!!!""
I stand, dust the ashes off of my jeans, and turn around. My heart drops when I recognize the werewolf standing about 200 feet away from me.
This has to be a joke. This cannot be happening.

1guqa6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1guqa6t/for_those_who_suffer_with_extreme_ear_pain_when/,For those who suffer with extreme ear pain when flying ,"Disclaimer: Long post. If you want to skip to the advice, scroll to where I start the numbers.

Since my very first time flying, I have struggled immensely with insufferable levels of ear pain when flying. My ears cannot seem to equalize pressure like normal people’s can. I have an incredibly high pain tolerance, and this is by far the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt. It feels like someone is repeatedly twisting a hot serrated knife into my eardrum, while the pressure in my head builds to a point that it feels like my skull might explode. The pain makes me claw at my ears and sob like a baby. Once the flight is over, the pain doesn’t stop- my ears continue to hurt for days after, and I’ve experienced partial or nearly full loss of hearing in one or both ears that has lasted up to a week. In my case, I believe the issue is genetic and likely related to some variation of a Eustachian tube disorder, but I digress. 

I’ve tried everything- things people told me to do, advice from flight attendants, and pretty much everything you can find when you Google it. I was so tired of hearing the same things over and over. “Chew gum!” “Yawn!” “Drink something!” “Eat something!” “Suck on hard candy!” yada yada yada. I’ve spoken with multiple doctors about the issue, and they give me more of the same useless advice. Oh, and don’t even mention the Valsalva maneuver: been there, done that, perforated my eardrum. 

This guide is for people who genuinely suffer like I do, in a way that makes you dread flying because you know you’re going to experience unbearable pain followed by lingering pain and loss of hearing. These are all things I have tried personally that have worked for me. I can now fly comfortably with very minimal pain. 

1. Earplanes: 
I know people are skeptical about these earplugs, and some say they don’t work. It’s possible they may not work for you, because everyone is different, but it could also be a case of user error. These earplugs have a ceramic filter that stops the abrupt pressure changes, and rather allows the pressure to change gradually over time. You can buy them at any pharmacy and I know Target carries them as well. They’re supposed to be good for one round-trip flight. I wouldn’t reuse them more than twice. With that said, make SURE you are inserting them at minimum 30 minutes prior to landing. You should be putting them in before the descent begins, otherwise they won’t work as well. When you insert them, pull up on your upper earlobe to “open” your ear canal, and gently twist them in. They have a corkscrew-like structure, and I think twisting them in is the only way to ensure a proper “seal” in your ear canal. These things have been a lifesaver for me. I won’t fly without them. 

2. Oral decongestant (like Sudafed): 
I started incorporating Sudafed into my flight routine and I think it’s helped a lot. I take it 30mins-1hr prior to takeoff. I think it helps open up my sinuses to allow the pressure to equalize better. I wouldn’t use this if I was flying constantly, because I don’t like to overuse medication, but for the occasional trip, it’s worth trying. 

3. Nasal spray (such as Afrin): 
This is a tip I got from someone online, but it’s a great one. Nasal sprays like Afrin can help open up the sinus passageways, allowing for better pressure equalization. I usually do a quick spray before takeoff and another good one right before we start the descent. I’d be careful though, because I did hear some people can become addicted to nasal spray (I’m not sure how that works, but just thought I’d mention it). 

4. Supplementary aids: chewing, swallowing, yawning
This is all the “other stuff” that people tell you to do. On its own, none of this works for me. However, when coupled with the other methods, I think it does help a tiny bit. My preference is chewing gum or drinking something warm, like coffee or tea. 

My personal method involves combining all of the above. I still sometimes have slight pain, but it is absolutely nothing compared to what I felt before. I highly recommend trying out some of these things for yourself if you also struggle with severe ear pain on flights! Hope this helps, and happy traveling! 

Note: I’ve spoken with several doctors about this, but never an ENT. I do plan to talk with an ENT about it at some point in the near future, because I’d like to fully understand why this happens. If anyone has the same issues and has spoken to an ENT, what did they say? From what I’ve gathered, the only options might be tubes in my ears or having a surgery to correct Eustachian tube disorder (if that’s actually what I have). Would love to hear from you if you’ve gotten answers!

So, basically I don't eat breakfast and only started eating after 12pm. Basically, I only consume coffee in the morning, most of the time.

My current beans is El Salvador Casablanca, medium roasted. Purchased it from my local roaster, where they only roasted upon order. I'm using 15-17grams of beans, the grind it with my Timemore Chestnut C2, 14 clicks. Then I pour 50°C of water into the chamber of 3 pot Bialetti Rainbow, fill it up to below the safety valve and using a diffuser on a gas stove, low heat/flame.

Normally it took 4-5 minutes for the first liquid to sprout and switch off the fire just before it started bubbling, close the lid and remove it from the diffuser plate almost immediately and leave it until all the coffee stop sprouting.

Usually I'll get around 120 ml, then adding the same amount of hot water, around 80°C. Put one or two drops of stevia and that they way I enjoy my morning coffee currently.

I can say, I really enjoy this beans because it's not too acidic like light roasted beans from Ethiopia and yet, not too heavy and smoky like the medium dark roasted Brazilian beans blend that I normally drink. The taste notes given by the roaster are caramel, chocolate and bittersweet aftertaste of cocoa, but honestly I don't think I could taste any of that😅.

Dates have always been very tame, coffee, dinner, casual drink, dinner at her place. We’ve seen each other about once every week or so over this time. While I wasn’t looking for an immediate “spark” right off the bat, I was hoping that things would have at least progressed a bit further than they have in terms of affection/flirting/etc. With every date/hangout we definitely are getting closer in terms of friendship, just not intimacy. 

She has mentioned that she has never had a serious relationship before and tends to keep to herself, but after 5 dates we’ve only had brief make outs and nothing more. I’m not upset about the lack of sex, but even simple physical contact like hand holding, cuddling or just displays of affection aren’t there. She seems to put herself in spots where we’re not close in proximity (sitting on the other end of the booth, spot at the other end of the couch, etc.) My question is how long do you wait for that to progress before deciding that maybe it just isn’t a good fit. 

TLDR: things are moving very slow and not sure if it’s my impatience or a lack of compatibility that’s driving it.",2,1731994612.0,dating,2,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/xvu9388tns1e1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=02c640b03f1dd96f57fd8f4ea1f1ab38606d3854

One of the first questions people ask about latte art is whether a sharp spouted pitcher will help make their pours more detailed. This is a misconception. Sharp spout pitchers and round spout pitchers are different tools with different purposes. While there are many styles of latte art, poured latte art can be divided into two broad categories: free pour and basic pour.

* Free pour: [free pour patterns](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1hGWnPJuKu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) are drawing pours, where the pitcher is used like a pencil or brush to draw a pattern on top of the coffee. Free pours currently dominate most of the world stage when it comes to latte art competitions.
   * Sharp spouted pitchers are designed for free pour latte art. For free pour, baristas desire a pitcher that lessens the effects of flow on the pattern, enabling more precise placement of small details. This necessitates a pitcher with a narrower spout that restricts the flow from the pitcher. In terms of technique, free pour baristas hover higher above the surface of the coffee with their pitcher, and many free pour pitchers will also have a longer spout to accommodate.
* Basic pour: [basic pour patterns](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvI7mUsM3O9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) are pours with more emphasis on flow from the pitcher. Despite the name, they aren’t necessarily a fundamental or basic skill, just a different style of pour. Free pour specialists won’t necessarily win in throwdowns against people who specialize in basic pours.
   * Round spouted pitchers are designed for basic latte art. The patterns have more sweeping lines and curves that require higher flow to achieve. A rounder, stubbier spout is more suitable because of the higher flow achieved and the enhanced tactile feedback. Some latte artists have taken to using [extremely wide pitchers](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy4FPQ9RMIe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) that barely have a spout to great effect.",4,1731994271.0,latteart,0,1.0,False

Anxiety. Insomnia. Depression. Anger. Guilt. Fear. 

Maybe it isn't right to say that work is always explicitly the cause, but when you spend a majority of your waking life there.. sure, let's not completely discount the idea.

Like many of you, I studied accounting as a young buck who didn't know any better. But! when I graduated, I said - to hell with this - and I worked anything and everything but accounting. I wasn't gonna sit in an office. I was a landscaper (and loved it!), I was a bartender (i also loved it!), I worked a variety of hospitality jobs - one of them still holds the title for my favorite job. I drove trucks, did menial handyman work, painted houses, I even installed insulation for a summer (I admit this was awful). But something always remained unfulfilled, I never felt like I had to think. And I liked my brain, I wasn't some mensa kid, but I still liked problem solving. I liked reading, and discussing difficult topics. My work was always at odds with my brain.

So one day I changed tack. I went back to school for the extra credits, got a job in public accounting, put my hours in, and great I got a CPA. It was wholly underwhelming for so much hard work. And to be frank, I still only find it's a hassle having to submit CPE. But it's done, and now I'm on a career path.

It certainly hasn't been as easy as bartending. I'm not outside like I was when I painted or did lawns. I'm sure not as lean as I was when I labored! 

Ah, but I do work with some very smart people. I sit in a comfy chair in my air conditioned office and drink coffee. I get to make wicked excel spreadsheets and play with cool tools that manipulate data. Eh, no one thinks my job is interesting, which is kind of a bummer, I wouldn't mind telling them some of the cool stuff I've been working on, but most people don't get it, and they don't care. To be fair, they probably wouldn't have cared when I was fixing toilets either. But it's work after all.

I'm grateful that I'm not exposed to actual danger, harmful chemicals or processes, I get paid reasonably well, and overall my hours are actually really flexible. I have autonomy. And my mind isn't going numb while I edge that lawn so fucking perfect - gosh I loved that tho.",41,1731994063.0,Accounting,7,0.92,False
1guq08z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1guq08z/why_does_nobody_care_if_theyre_sick/,Why does nobody care if they’re sick?!,"First trimester I was doing relatively well- had some minor food aversions and was stereotypically tired, but still able to handle my business without too much interruption. 

We had a roommate at the time who had the flu, knew I was pregnant and yet still tried to hide it from us. He was a heavy smoker and we all shared a bathroom and his bedroom was directly across the “hall” (3x5 walkway) from us. This meant that we all touched the same doorknobs, light switches, etc in a very small space. I instantly got sick because I wasn’t able to properly protect myself…leading to two and a half weeks of absolute hell, with sympomts lingering through the rest of the trimester. Nausea, dehydration, absurd congestion…all before I was able to get in to see my OBGYN for my first appt. Because of this, I was too scared to take any kinds of meds and just suffered through. My husband is sweet, but considered “taking care of me” as grabbing some fast food for me so I didn’t have to cook dinner, or making a random pb&j. I was FURIOUS with roommate for hiding the info when I had already warned him if he was sick, that I needed to know so I could protect myself. Made my first trimester AWFUL. 

I’m now in my third trimester. We have a “friendly acquaintance” that was originally referred to us about a year ago to do some small contractor work for us around the house. Throughout the pregnancy he has continued to do small woodworking based tasks (custom closet system for nursery, install shelving in our laundry room, adjust a couple of doorways and install new doors). He’s been around enough that he knew how nervous I was/am about becoming sick again, especially while THIS pregnant, AND YET SHOWED UP AT OUR HOUSE SICK AS A DOG WITH THE FLU. He also has three kids and knows how dangerous it can be to run a fever while pregnant…yet showed up sick. I asked if he had a fever in the past 24hrs and he just shrugged and said, “idk man, I don’t really ever check my temperature. I just know I’ve been on the couch for the past week feeling terrible. Today’s the first day I’ve even been able to stand upright and I need the cash so I figured I’d come work on this project”. 

Thankfully husband sent him home and I disinfected every square inch of the house he had been hacking, sneezing, and coughing all over. Husband got sick, but him immune system was able to handle it while I went and stayed with my parents for a couple of days just to be cautious. 
  
And now it’s flu/RSV season. My husband’s family is WELL aware of our due date (Dec 5), but is trying to guilt us into showing up for a holiday dinner with over 50+ people planning to attend, many driving from out of town ONE WEEK after baby is supposed to be due. They want us to, “come stop by for a couple of hours so we can see the baby”. Also, for some reason my MIL just KEEPS sticking her foot in her mouth, to the point that I actually don’t know if she’s serious or not? I sent her a picture of our most recent ultrasound and her only response was, “I can’t wait to kiss all over those sweet cheeks and hands”. She consistently makes comments about “stuffing those grandbabies full of sweets and sending them back home” (husband is a health nut, I’m a dental hygienist and we want to keep our kids off sweets until at least 2yoa), and about kissing our newborn…I’m starting to get more nervous that she’s less joking with each comment. 

My family is a bit more understanding, but I went to my moms today to have lunch with her and she showed me a Christmas themed book she plans to keep at her house to read to the baby on Christmas Eve. She saw my eyebrow go up and immediately “wanted to confirm” that we will be coming over on Christmas Eve with the baby to celebrate with everyone. Everyone being my brothers and their wives driving in from out of state, my constantly ill grandmother (has had COVID every season this year, the flu twice, and constant upper respiratory infections), and **maybe** the neighbors who I’ve met maybe three times.    

I told both sides of the family that as of right now we are not making any plans and fully intend on being home for the holidays this year. If they want to stop by our home we will have coffee and some dessert, but they need to call ahead and make sure it’s a good time before coming over since baby will be 2-4 weeks old and we will still be adjusting. 

WHAT is the obsession for disregarding health concerns and just doing what you want, despite these adults knowing better? Aren’t they the same adults who want to force all of their advice on you and tell you the best ways to raise a baby? But they can’t comprehend the need to keep a newborn away from large groups of people and germs mere weeks after being born? Why are family snuggles so much more important than keeping a newborn safe?!

Good Lord give me strength and patience. I don’t mind being the “bad guy”, but why do they keep putting me in positions to have to be? It’s so frustrating. ",5,1731994057.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

1gupwyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gupwyx/the_ultimate_guide_to_hanging_pendant_lights/,"The Ultimate Guide to Hanging Pendant Lights: Height, Spacing, and Styling","Pendant lights are more than just a source of illumination; they’re versatile decor elements that enhance the aesthetic appeal of any space. Whether you’re installing [hanging lights in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) to elevate your home’s interior or exploring new ways to complement your decor, understanding the right height, spacing, and styling for your pendant lights is crucial. Let’s delve into the essentials to ensure your pendant lights shine in all the right ways.

**1. Determining the Ideal Height**

The height at which pendant lights are hung can dramatically impact the room’s ambiance and functionality. Here are some general guidelines:

**Over Dining Tables or Kitchen Islands**

Hang the pendant light 28-34 inches above the table or countertop.

Ensure there’s enough clearance for people to move around without bumping into the light.

**In Living Rooms**

When placing [hanging lights for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), position them high enough to avoid obstructing views or movement. 

If the light is above a coffee table, hang it 6-12 inches above the table’s surface. 

For open areas, ensure the bottom of the fixture is at least 7 feet above the floor.

**In Entryways or Staircases**

Install the light 6-7 feet above the ground for safety and visual balance.

For double-height spaces, center the pendant to highlight the area’s verticality.

**2. Perfect Spacing for Pendant Lights**

When using multiple pendants, spacing them evenly ensures a harmonious look:

**Over Dining Tables or Kitchen Islands**

Space pendants 24-30 inches apart for balanced lighting.

For long tables, use an odd number of lights for symmetry.

**Living Room Clusters**

In modern interiors, pendant lights are often grouped in clusters. This technique adds depth and charm:

Group them at varying heights for an artistic touch.

Ensure the cluster doesn’t overpower other lighting elements like table lamps for living rooms.

**3. Styling Tips for Pendant Lights**

The right style of pendant light can transform your space. Consider these ideas:

**Materials and Finishes**

What should I wear? Like is there \*too\* cute or too much for a first date? since it's a first little coffee date should it be more like really casual wear or should I get a little bit dressed up? Like a cute skirt and top vs jeans.

And what do I do if I just get super nervous with gay panic (she's really freaking cute) and just go like catatonic or something????

I'd never considered buying a machine, but on this particular day, I go on Facebook marketplace and find a $100 Breville Barista Pro that was 'broken'. I like DIY so I figured I'll see whats wrong and if I have any luck resolving it. When I get there, I'm told its just the milk frother thats broken and doesn't make any steam.. I don't drink milk so it's a big win already. Turns out, it just needed a pin in the steam wand holes to clear them and within 30 seconds it works as good as new. 

At $100 down for a fully working machine, my next step was to get some new equipment to get me going at an entry level price point, so I went straight to AliExpress. 

Here's my setup:

Here's the items I purchased and the rough cost I paid (after using some deals/cashabck offers):  
  
1. Coffee Tamper w/wooden handle - $17. Really heavy, feels like great quality.

2. Coffee Grind Cleaning Brush MHW-3BOMBER - $10. Real walnut, food grade, love it.

3. Coffee Puck Stand - $3. Awaiting delivery of some screen to try them out.

4. Fuego Coffee Scales - $25. I am so impressed by these. In-built timer as well as memory.

5. Bottomless Portafilter 54mm for my Breville - $21. Never used one before but it made some wonderful coffee and pulled some great shots so far. The stock basket works great. Nothing to compare against though.

6. Dosing Funnel Ring 54mm - $5. Works on the stock and bottomless portafilters, avoids any mess under the grinder and looks to be CNC'd as it's a high quality metal finish.

7. Coffee Distributer 53mm & Silicone Tamping mat - $9. Works great, no adjustment, but its perfect for both baskets so can't ask for more. Silicone mat is pretty thin, in future I would consider a right angle mat or a wooden tamping station.

8. Milk Frother Jug 300ml - $6. Stainless food grade steel, looks and works as expected.

9. Ceramic Dosing Cup, twisting water prayer - $7. Small, easy, cheap and convenient.

10. 25ml Wooden Handle Spoon - $4. Quality spoon, and the scoop is almost an exact 9g each time.

11. WDT Tool - $3. Lovely rosewood (maybe not real) case which looks lovely. Works great, does what it needs too. Could imagine a larger one in future might be an upgrade?

12. 2x Handmade Ceramic Espresso Cup - $1. Courtesy of the thrift store. I love these so much.

13. Vacuum Sealed Coffee Canister - $13. Seems to do a great job and seals well. Can't actually confirm how vacuumed the seal is, but when you push it down, the air comes out. 

14. [Coffee Legend Beans (Gossy Blend) 250g](https://legendcoffee.com.au/products/blend-gossy?srsltid=AfmBOorGM08Ky309F_KvsiZJKHjStOLfIZKjEVNqH6EWLscbn1LWoqdk) \- $19.5. Enjoyed these beans ever since I first tried it at the 

Total Cost: $124 (accessories) + $19.5 (beans) + $100 (Breville Barista Pro) = $243.5

I haven't got anything more expensive to compare it all too, but I can tell you that each item I received is completely fit for purpose and has been used dozens of times now and works flawlessy enough to deliver me a lovely cup of espresso each day.

I'm grinding on size 6, using 18g beans and doing a 2:1 ratio which gets me to 36g espresso in the 27-35 second range. Working for me, but looking forward to trying to play with this further.

“Look, it’s not just the Devour, okay?” I pleaded. “He has a great silence and… and he scales late game!”  

I could feel her judgment piercing me like Doom’s Scorched Earth. She stood up, grabbed her bag, and before walking out said, “Good luck finding a support group.”

1gupoep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gupoep,Snacks to go with cupping: Update on how it went,"Hi all, 

Last week I made a post asking for advice on what would go well with a cupping I was hosting and the feedback was phenomenal. I learned a lot on what I should do and what makes a good host and I wanted to share some of the highlights and the big takeaways from this gathering. 

1. Try to be as organized as possible. I had everything ready but it still took quite a while to get things started. Maybe grind the beans and have everything laid out a few minutes before people arrive.

2. We had pastries after the cupping session along with a pour over of the winning bean of the day for everyone as well.

3. The reactions to the different beans and how dialed in some taste buds were vs others was definitely the most fun aspect of doing a blind cupping as a group. 

We had 5 beans and some were quite different from each other and also there were some real standouts that I’m still thinking about right now:

September “Buttercream” really stood out as there was a sweetness to it but it had all these different aromas that I can’t put my finger on. Definitely not what I’m used to.

Library “Claudio Nakamura” this is a bean that I’ve been having the most over the past month so it was a bean I’m very comfortable with, a nice caramel/toffee taste although one person said it tasted like soy sauce… lol

Hatch “Supernova” didn’t go well with the present group as the following notes were said: tomato, dirt, unsweetened black tea…

DeMelo “Gentleman” if you’ve ever smelled or tasted Starbucks Italian or French roast, this is that basically, yuck!

Epoch “Kayon Mountain” so the initial tastings we thought this was very light in flavour almost like a black tea, but as we continued going back to it the flavours just started really coming alive and it was floral and fruity. Absolutely amazing and 4 out 5 of us picked it as the winner.

Thank you to everyone for the recommendations and advice. I’m excited to host more of these down the road and honestly it was just fun to hang with family and friends over some coffee!",4,1731992889.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/I4wYwVCEPy): **November 8, 2024**

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP got the majority of NTAs and few YTAs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Does OOP and his family know anything about the BF’s background?**

> **OOP:** I quickly went over his facebook account so it’s not really verified info, but I saw pictures of him with his ex (I think?) and she looked 20-24 maybe? It’s still better but if the guy has a thing for younger girls that’s even more wrong. And it seems like he was still with his ex when he started dating my niece, so even weirder… 

**How did OOP’s niece meet the BF?**

> **OOP:** Through sports apparently. My niece does tennis and so does he, in the same club and they met during a tournament (at least that’s what she told me the first time she told me she had a boyfriend)

**Was the BF Ella’s coach when they met?**

> **OOP:** No I don’t think so. From what I understood, Ella was in a tournament in her club and she played against adults, she played against Mark and after he came to talk to her so they talked and that was basically it

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/FxekXi30AB): **November 9, 2024**

If you didn't see my previous post, here's a tl;dr: my niece is 18 and getting married with a man who's 36. They started dating when she was 17. When she announced she was engaged I said that it was wrong that he was so much older than her, but everyone else found it okay.

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.

2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.

3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP should be there for his niece should she have any further concerns or worries about her relationship with her BF**

> **OOP:** If she doesn’t want to talk about it then fine, it’s her choice. But the least I can do is ask her if she’d want to. You don’t just “let it go” when it’s predators we’re talking about. Do you know how trapped she can be for years if she goes through with it? The least I can do is try my best to let her know that it’s weird before she makes such a commitment. And if she doesn’t want to hear it then fine, but no one should just “let it go” when it comes to these things

+

> Yeah I’ll definitely let her know that I’m always there, and be ready to help her get out of the relationship when it all goes wrong. But I think it’s also important to try and talk her out of it. It might not succeed, but if there’s even the slightest chance that it might then it’s worth trying. I’d rather she gets out of the relationship now than in 3 years when she’s traumatized by this guy

Tl;dr of first posts: My 18yo niece is engaged to a 36yo she started dating when she was 17. No one in the family sees a problem. I asked to meet her to talk about it.

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP clarifies details regarding the BF’s previous relationship prior to current one with Ella** 

> **OOP:** To explain this in more details: 
> 
> I went through the guy’s socials with my friends a few days ago because we thought there might be other weird things going on and we ended up finding info about his previous relationship (the one right before Ella). 
> 
> So Ella told me at Christmas (so december 24th) that they had been dating for “a few months”, but when we searched his Facebook we saw a post wishing happy birthday to a girl who he called his “baby” on December 12th. And this girl appeared in other posts where they were kissing or he was calling her pet names so we assumed she was his gf. Which Ella confirmed afterwards.
> 
> And this girl also looked very young. He at one point wrote something about her and said “as soon as you’re done with college”, so we knew she was in college. And she looked between 20 and 25. And Ella then confirmed that she was 21. 
> 
> But yeah basically it seemed like he was still with his ex while dating Ella, so I asked her if she knew about that.

**OOP should be prepared to support his niece if she chooses to break up with her BF and distance himself from the family if they are blaming OOP for Ella’s breaksup**

> **OOP:** Yeah, I’m pretty sure if she ends up breaking up with him (which I hope) her dad will blame me for it… Which is the last thing she’ll need if she manages to get out of that relationship 

+

> I will gladly take the blame, but I’m just scared she’ll feel guilty about it and blame herself if she sees that her dad is mad at me. She’s a very empathetic kid, which is a really great quality, but sometimes she hurts herself because of it…

I had the most vivid dream I've ever had in my life (38yo). It felt so real... 

In my dream I was living in a big maze like house, with all the walls painted yellow, almost like the backrooms or something. I found a bedroom upstairs and inside was Simone Giertz (the youtuber) and she had an Asian son for some reason. When I spoke to her I realized this couldn't be real and I called her out, at which point she slowly started fading away. But before she was completely gone I asked her to stay and she did. We started exploring the house and I found another room with my two pet birds inside. They were exactly as they are in real life, I couldn't tell the difference. At which point I started second guessing if this was possibly real, some kind of alternate reality or something. We eventually ended up going back upstairs and when we reached the top, a man came charging at me. I kicked him in the chest and he fell down the stairs. When I turned back, Simone looked creepy af, bulging eyes and a face like a demon. I told myself I needed to bite her to prove this was a dream and I did. I bit her face and could even taste a rotten taste as I did it. She was holding her child and dropped him, at which point I ran downstairs to my birds. Told them I loved them and I was sorry but I needed to wake up. It felt like I was abandoning them and I felt terrible. After saying goodbye, I closed my eyes and when I opened them I was now awake, looking at the wall of my bedroom. I have never woken up like this from a dream and was actually a bit terrified that I may still be dreaming. So I got up, made some coffee and had a cigarette because I didnt want to fall back asleep.

Sorry for the long story, I guess I just needed to tell someone about it cause I'm still pretty weirded out. Also, this dream felt like an eternity, and I rarely remember my dreams like this. So just be warned about taking guaifenesin before bed lol.",1,1731992355.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

I am a sophomore at a ""semi-target"" and I had some upperclassmen mentors of mine suggest I recruit for IB roles given this is the best time.

I have one coworker who is my shift lead and she is a 30 year old mom. I’m a 24 year old man and one of the younger people at my job. 

I’ve always really struggled with self confidence and social anxiety and have been studying stoicism as a way to improve myself and navigate difficult situations. I have always really hated being teased and this girl is always trying to “roast” me. I have only been there for a month but she says we are friends? She is always trying to organize stuff with coworkers and invite me saying she’s gonna buy me a drink for my birthday and stuff.

Shes always making fun of my expressions because I have a tendency to smile and kind of bug my eyes out when I get anxious, which happens whenever she’s around me. She’s also always saying she wants to beat me up as a joke. 

It’s kind of bizarre and I am having trouble knowing how to respond. I try to roast her back but it’s not really in my nature and feels kind of forced. I just feel like I have to stand up for myself. It’s weird because she’s always saying how much she likes me and praises my work and stuff.

I’m looking for some guidance on setting up my living room for an optimal viewing and audio experience. I’ve included pictures of my space and the soundbar system I recently purchased for context.

Here’s what I’m struggling with:

1.	TV Wall-Mount Placement:
	•	My current TV is a 55”, but I have a 77” on the way that I plan to mount on the wall.
	•	The wall where the TV will go is off-center relative to my couch and coffee table, which makes me question if I should center the TV on the wall or align it with the seating area for a better viewing experience. Additionally, I’m unsure how high to mount the TV.

2.	Rear Speakers:
	•	The soundbar I purchased comes with rear speakers, but my couch is positioned close to the back wall. Does it make sense to use the rear speakers in this space? If so, how should I position them for the best surround sound effect?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!",0,1731991830.0,hometheater,7,0.5,False

The *Dream of the Lady* slid through the void. Silent. Stealthy. Vulnerable. Yvian sat in her comfy Captain's chair, shoulders clenched. Launching a stealth attack on the FodderBots had seemed simple when she'd proposed it. Easy. The primitive machines should be helpless against Yvian's superior technology. They would be, if there weren't so fucking many of them.

""The FodderBot patrol has changed trajectory,"" Kilroy reported. ""We can resume our original course.""

""Make it so,"" Yvian ordered. Dodging patrols had been more difficult than expected. The machine fleets didn't follow a set pattern. They changed course at random. It was inefficient, and left gaps in coverage, but the unpredictability made them much more dangerous.

""This has got be the longest day I've ever had,"" Lissa complained. ""How much longer until we can fire?""

""Fourteen hours, thirty seven minutes, nine seconds,"" said the Peacekeeper unit. ""The second Cascade Annihilator will be fired nineteen minutes and four seconds after that.""

""Crunch."" Lissa rested an elbow on her console, propping her head in her hand.

""I wonder if this is what prey feels like,"" said Scarrend. ""Scurrying about, desperate to stay hidden, always aware of a death that could come any moment."" He steepled his upper set of hands, tapping two fingers together thoughtfully. ""It's an enlightening experience, but I would not care to repeat it.""

""I don't like it either,"" Yvian agreed. She'd spent the last twenty five hours just sitting and watching the sensors. It was exhausting. Millions of ships were moving around the sector. Yvian was also checking for monitoring stations, minefields, anything unexpected that could expose the *Dream*. If Stealth was compromised, they were dead. Forty million lasers would slag her ship before the Jumpdrive could get them out of there.  ""Too tense.""

""Stealth missions are always like that,"" said Mims. The human was the only one who seemed relaxed. The motherless son. ""You have to be alert and aware at all times, and you have to keep that vigilance up for a lot longer than other missions. There's a lot more pressure to be perfect than there is in a straight up fight.""

""I'm less worried about perfection,"" said Lissa, ""and more worried about the millions of killer robots with lasers.""

""It'll be fine,"" the human assured her. ""If the FodderBots could see through our stealth we'd be dead by now.""

""That's not as comforting as you think it is,"" Lissa told him.

""It should be,"" said Mims. ""As stealth missions go this is as easy at it gets."" He yawned. ""Speaking of which, maybe it's time people started getting some sleep.""

""You think anyone's going to sleep at a time like this?"" asked Captain Yvian.

""We will if we know what's good for us,"" said the human. ""It'll be fifteen hours before we can turn around, and another thirty after that before we can leave FodderBot space. Trying to keep all of us awake that long will lead to mistakes.""

""This unit does not require sleep,"" Kilroy reminded them. ""This unit will be sufficient to continue the mission.""

""Kilroy's doing all the work anyway,"" Mims pointed out, ""but we can sleep in shifts if it makes you feel better, Captain.""

Yvian considered it. She didn't like the idea of going to sleep. Not surrounded by enemies as she was. Her voidarmor could keep her awake and alert for days if need be. It was a dangerous function, not to be used unnecessarily, but this kind of work was exactly what it was for.

On the other hand, no amount of technology could completely replace a good night's sleep. The longer the crew went without rest, the less functional they would become. They were already under stress, and that stress would hit harder the longer they stayed awake. Mental exhaustion would lead to mistakes, no matter how thoroughly stimulated the armors kept them. The human was right. They should sleep.

""Fine,"" said Captain Yvian. ""Scarrend and I will take the first watch. You and Lissa get some sleep. We'll wake you in eight hours.""

Eight hours felt like a very long time. Boredom, fear, and frustration mingled with the stimulants Yvian's armor was using to keep her awake. It was miserable. By the time Mims and Lissa wandered back onto the bridge, Yvian almost wanted to get caught. Getting burned to death by third rate Synthetics would be embarrassing, but at least she wouldn't have to sit around and worry anymore.

""How'd you sleep?"" Yvian tried to sound friendly, but it came out almost as grumpy as she felt.

""Like a baby,"" said the human.

""He woke up crying several times,"" Lissa clarified. Yvian was pretty sure she was grinning under her helmet. ""He might also have wet himself.""

Mims turned to look at his girlfriend. ""What?""

""That's how babies sleep,"" Lissa told him.

""I can't believe I'm sleeping with you."" Mims shook his head in disapproval.

""Yeah you can."" Lissa slid an arm around his waste. ""Face it, Mark. I'm too cute to resist.""

The human snorted, but did not disagree. He draped an arm over Lissa and asked. ""Did we miss anything?""

""Several course changes and an increasingly irritable Captain,"" Scarrend informed him. ""I think it would be wise if you relieved us.""

""Definitely,"" Yvian agreed. ""Take your stations. I'm going to go pass out.""

""Aye, Captain Sis."" Lissa saluted her.

""Why are you so cheerful?"" Yvian grumbled. ""Did you replace your water reserves with beer again?""

""Of course not,"" Lissa protested. ""That was one time."" The other pixen shrugged. ""I'm a morning person, and I got good sleep cuddled with my boy toy.""

""Man toy,"" Mims corrected.

""Man toy,"" Lissa agreed. ""It's not as nice when we're both in armor, but it's still good.""

""I hate you both,"" said Yvian. Why didn't she have someone to cuddle with? ""I'm going to sleep now.""

""We love you too, Captain."" Mims gave her a wave. ""Sleep well."" Lissa gave Yvian a hug on the way out.

Yvian choked down some protein paste as she stumbled down to her quarters. Nasty stuff, but it was the only food to be had as long as the *Dream* was depressurized. She promised herself she'd make the human cook something good once the mission was over. And maybe a cake. Yvian deserved cake. She flopped down on her bunk and deactivated the armor's ALERTNESS function. To her surprise and delight, she was asleep seconds later.

Yvian was not cheerful when she woke. She was not a morning person. She was even less cheerful when she noticed the time on her HUD. She'd been asleep for ten hours. She should have set an alarm. Yvian choked down cool water and warm protein paste as she made her way to the bridge. Everyone else was already there.

""Good morning, sleepyhead."" Lissa waved.

""No it's not,"" Yvian grumbled. ""Sorry I'm late.""

""You needed it,"" said Mims. ""You were up later.""

""Your species needs more sleep than mine,"" Scarrend added.

Yvian plopped down in her comfy Captain's chair, wishing for coffee. ""Report?""

""Two Cascade Annihilators have been launched,"" Kilroy informed her. ""They will reach their targets in seven days, six hours, and forty three minutes.""

""We're on our way back to the Gate,"" Mims added. ""Once we get behind it we can jump out of the system.""

The way back was less stressful, but not by much. Mims and Kilroy were the only ones who seemed unbothered. Everyone else did their best to monitor sensors with clenched shoulders and gritted teeth. It was a long nerve-wracking day, but uneventful. Captain Yvian had everyone sleep in shifts again. This time she remembered to have her armor wake her up. She returned to the bridge when they were just an hour away from the Gate.

The *Dream of the Lady* circled the Gate at a distance of two hundred thousand kilometers. Yvian didn't think the FodderBots were smart enough to have anything hiding behind it, but she wasn't taking any chances. When the area behind the Gate came into view, she was relieved to find no surprises.

""Thank the Bright Lady,"" said Yvian. ""Take us behind it and lets get out of here.""

""Affirmative, Captain Mother Yvian,"" Kilroy acknowledged the order.

So close, now. All they had to do was jump to the next system, launch an Annihilator at the closest FodderBot fleet, and get out. Yvian debated giving them the rest of the day off once it was done. Well, giving most of them the day off. Mims would still have to cook. Her musings were interrupted by a blip on the sensors.

""Alert,"" said Kilroy. ""A Saucer has entered the sector.""

Yvian swore. The Saucer was much bigger than the ones she'd previously seen. It was over a kilometer across, almost as big as the *Dream*. The cloud of electromagnetic radiation surrounding it was much more powerful as well. The FodderBots reacted to its presence with extreme prejudice. Every ship in the sector turned to unleash lasers on the interloper.

""MAC Cannons,"" Yvian ordered. ""Fire the moment it gets close.""

The Saucer ignored the lasers. It hovered over the FodderBot homeworld for several seconds. Then it disappeared. It reappeared four kilometers from the *Dream*. Yvian's console went blank. The bridge lights went out.

""What the Crunch?"" Yvian turned to look around the bridge. The motion drifted her out of her chair. The artificial gravity was out. So was Yvian's HUD. Whatever the Saucer had hit them with had shut down everything. Yvian's whole body clenched. The Saucer had shut down everything.

She couldn't see. Dim starlight filtered in through the viewports, but it wasn't enough to illuminate the bridge. A flash of green drew her eyes. Mims. He was holding a glowstick. Yvian fumbled in one of her armor's pouches for a glowstick of her own.

Mims had a hand on Lissa's arm. He kicked off, aiming for Yvian. Yvian grabbed her console to hold herself in place. When the human reached her he pressed his helmet against hers. ""We're going to restart the reactors. It's our only chance.""

""Go!"" Yvian ordered. Mims maneuvered himself to the door to the bridge. The door was closed. Yvian felt a brief moment of panic before she remembered the *Dream* was a human built ship. It had a number of safety features, including a pneumatic override that could open doors in case of power failure. Mims opened a panel next to the door and had it open in seconds. He glided swiftly into the corridor with Lissa clumsily fumbling her way behind.

Yvian was still braced for the beams of light the Saucers used, but none came. She hoped Kilroy had managed to fire. She hoped the MAC Cannons had killed the motherless sons. She tried looking out the viewports, but the angle was wrong. The Saucer wasn't in sight.

The *Dream* was still moving. Momentum would take them behind the Gate soon if it hadn't already. That wouldn't buy them much time. Without power, the *Dream* wouldn't stop. She'd drift out from behind the Gate in minutes. Then they'd be exposed to millions of hostile Synthetics without Stealth or shields. They wouldn't last a second.

Scarrend was checking on Kilroy. Yvian joined him. The Peacekeeper unit was still upright, but he wasn't moving. Yvian pulled her blaster. She aimed for a bulkhead and pulled the trigger. Nothing. Crunch. She'd hoped it would have power. If she could connect the Peacekeeper unit to a power source he might come back online.

She waved her glowstick to get the Vrrl's attention. Once Scarrend was looking, she pressed her helmet to his. ""Mims and Lissa are heading for the reactors. Get to your station and activate Stealth the moment they get one online."" If they could get one online. Whatever had taken out the *Dream*, it was scarily similar to a Lucendian Anti-Tech Pulse. If it was exactly like a Pulse, the reactors were fried and they were all dead. Yvian prayed to the Bright Lady it was just some sort of high powered energy drain.

Yvian took her own advice, heading back to her Captain's Chair. It was hard to get to. Yvian was experienced with zero gravity, but she'd always had magnetic boots and a jetpack to rely on. Now she had neither. It took an embarrassingly long time to get back to her station. By the time she got there, Scarrend was already at his. Two of his arms held him in place over his chair. The other two hovered over his console, ready.

Yvian waited, fretting. How long had it been? Had the *Dream* made it behind the Gate before the Saucer killed their power? Had they been seen? Were the FodderBots coming? Even if they weren't, how much longer would it be before the *Dream* drifted out from behind the Gate? Would Mims and Lissa get the power back on in time? Could they get the power back on at all? If they couldn't, Yvian was dead whether the FodderBots saw them or not. The ship had no air, and her voidarmor only held enough for twenty minutes without power. Maybe she should send Scarrend to retrieve some oxygen tanks? No. There was no point. If power wasn't restored in twenty minutes then they were all dead anyway.

What about the Saucer? Was it dead, or just playing with Yvian before it came in for the kill? How did the thing find them, anyway? Was it just bad luck, or were they actively searching for the *Dream*? Thoughts and fears swirled through Yvian's head. She would very much have liked a distraction, but there was nothing to do but wait. She hovered worriedly over her chair, one hand poised over her console. It was all she could do.

The lights came on. Gravity dropped Yvian back into her chair. Yvian didn't waste time with the sensors. She pulled up flight control a brought the *Dream of the Lady* to a halt. The engines were sluggish. The *Dream* decelerated slowly. The edge of the Gate was only twenty kilometers away. They weren't going to make it.

""Stealth is active,"" Scarrend reported. His voice on internal comms hit Yvian with a shockwave of relief.

Mims commed in. ""I've got the reserve reactor running. We're heading for the mains right now.""

Yvian frowned. The backup reactor was further away than the mains. Why did he...? Oh. If they'd been hit with a Pulse, the main reactors would be dead, but the reserve hadn't been turned on. It would still work. Smart human. ""Understood,"" she answered. ""Good work.""

Yvian pulled up the sensors. The *Dream* had drifted past the Gate. Dozens of fleets of FodderBots were accelerating towards them. No, not towards Yvian's ship. They were heading for the Gate. The fleet that had been guarding it wasn't moving. Whatever the Saucer had done must have affected them, too. The next closest fleet would arrive in three hours. Yvian hoped to be gone by then.

The Saucer itself was behind the Gate now. It was dead. Nine strategically placed holes punctured the vessel. Kilroy's work. The Saucer was glowing with heat. Half of it had been melted by laser fire. Yvian thanked the Bright Lady the same hadn't happened to her ship. Yvian went back to flight control. Reserve power wasn't enough to engage full acceleration, but it would be enough to get the *Dream* back behind the Gate and out of the melted Saucer's flight path. With any luck Mims would get full power restored, and they could jump out of the sector.

Once the course was set, she asked Scarrend to monitor the sensors while she took care of Kilroy. The Peacekeeper unit fell over while she was trying to untuck his shirt. Yvian cursed, and asked Scarrend to switch with her. She was nowhere near strong enough to move a Peacekeeper unit by herself.

Scarrend rolled Kilroy over and finished pulling up his shirt. He pulled a power connector cord out of the side of the machine. He plugged it into Kilroy's console. He went back to his station. Nothing happened for several seconds. Then Kilroy's eyes flashed red.

""Unit online,"" said the Peacekeeper unit. ""Running diagnostics. Diagnostics complete. This unit is fully functional."" Kilroy climbed back to his feet. He turned to Yvian. ""What has this unit missed?""

""The Saucer knocked out our power somehow before you killed it,"" Yvian told him. ""We've got the reserve reactor running, and Stealth is active. We've got two million FodderBots heading right for the Gate, but they haven't seen us yet. Mims and Lissa are trying to get the main reactors online.""

""Acknowledged,"" said the unit. He started typing rapidly into his console. ""Thank you, Captain Mother Yvian.""

A few minutes later the main reactors kicked in. With power restored, Yvian activated the shields and started the jumpdrive. The Gate Effect had taken hold by the time Mims and Lissa returned to the bridge. ""Well that was gribshit,"" the human remarked. ""Were we seen?""

""Unknown,"" said Kilroy. ""The alien Pulse removed our Stealth, but it also removed our power signature and disabled all nearby FodderBots. The Saucer was seen and attacked, but we were not. It is possible the Saucer's electromagnetic field obscured us. It is also possible the FodderBots chose not to prioritize us as a target.""

""There's nothing we can do about it now,"" said Yvian. The *Dream* exited the Gate. Sensors showed a fleet of FodderBots. Yvian had jumped her ship to the same Gate they'd originally came from. The FodderBots were no longer accelerating. They were cruising for the far Gate at a speed of nine kilometers per second. ""Kilroy, set us a course. I want to hit that fleet with an Annihilator at the same time the other two hit.""

""Affirmative,"" said Kilroy. ""Course set. The Cascade Annihilator will be fired in three hours, nineteen minutes.""

Three hours to fire. Six hours before they could leave. Hmm. ""On second thought, Kilroy, can you take us behind the Gate instead? We need to repressurize the ship and recharge our voidarmor."" Yvian slumped deeper into her comfy Captain's Chair. ""And I'd really like a beer. It's been a long day.""

""You've only been awake for a few hours,"" Scarrend reminded her.

""And it's been a long day,"" Yvian repeated. ""I want beer and a bath and food that's not protein paste.""

""Me too,"" Lissa seconded.

""Affirmative,"" said Kilroy. ""Course set. We will be hidden behind the Gate in two minutes, twenty seven seconds.""

""Thank you Kilroy."" Yvian stood. ""That should be just enough time to grab some beer and get back to my quarters. I'm going to have a nice soak. Comm me when lunch is ready.""

""It'll be a while Captain Sis,"" Lissa warned. ""I want a bath too, and I'm taking my boy toy with me.""

""Man toy,"" Mims corrected.

""You can have an hour,"" Yvian decided. ""After that I expect Mims to make lunch.""

""I'm relegated to cook now?"" Yvian could hear the human's raised eyebrow. ""I used to be your Captain, you know.""

""And now I'm your Captain."" Yvian grinned. ""And your Captain wants cheeseburgers.""

City View Food Group, LLC., the owner of the Sweet Ballz cake ball brand, has been steadily growing since its inception in 2013. After a highly successful product launch in the U.S. convenience store segment, the company has continued to expand its presence in various domestic sales channels.

Joe Henningsen, Managing Partner of Sweet Ballz, shared insights on the company's growth strategy. ""Our primary growth focus has been in the food service segment, selling to the top U.S. distributors servicing catering, grab & go markets, coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, sports venues, colleges, universities, hospitals, assisted living, food trucks, and the list goes on,"" Henningsen stated.

The company has also seen significant growth in its seasonal online fulfillment operations through [sweetballz.com](http://sweetballz.com), which has been building year after year. This operation primarily runs from late fall to the end of spring. Henningsen hinted at potential expansion, saying, ""With new innovations coming, we may be able to expand upon our online sales calendar in the future."" Henningsen also stated that “we will be adding various company logo’d merchandise items online, which has been a one of their most common requests from loyal customers”.

Sweet Ballz continues to innovate and introduce new items based on customer demand. Looking ahead, Henningsen revealed that the retail grocery in-store bakery segment is their next big target area for 2025.

The journey hasn't been without challenges. ""Like any company, we have had our ups and downs, and getting through the pandemic was a real challenge,"" Henningsen admitted. ""However, that's in the past, and it looks like Sweet Ballz cake balls has a real bright future.""

The company's resilience is evident in its continued operation since its appearance on Shark Tank in 2013. Despite initial internal legal woes following the show, Sweet Ballz has managed to overcome obstacles and establish itself as a growing brand in the dessert and snack food industry.

Sweet Ballz offers a variety of flavors, including chocolate, cookies n' cream, red velvet, birthday cake, salted caramel, spicy chocolate and lemon which they call “their starting line-up”. 

As of 2024, Sweet Ballz continues to sell its products online through its website, shipping to the continental United States. The company's estimated annual revenue stands at $4 million, showcasing its growth since its Shark Tank appearance.

1gup39i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1gup39i/0430_in_the_morning/,04.30 in the morning.,"I finally broke. I been like a buddhist monk. Accept and adapt. Put up boundaries that she breaks - and never any consequences.

She will move out within two weeks after 18 years together and the last six years as an alcoholic in different stages- and tonight I broke and we had  a argument and in my world it was a bad one. 

It started this morning, she woke up after 6 straight days of drinking and had something she needed to do . Left at 10.00 and came back at 15.00 drunk and with a new supply of wine.
She hide the bottles ( really bad )and I saw them behind ”her” sofa and reminded her that I asked  for dinner money yesterday, she didn’t have any, but there is always wine money. 

So I took one bottle and told her that this will be dinner for the kids or something similar and put it in the fridge. No interaction until 04.30 when she woke me and the kids up and told me that she need that bottle I took. And she didn’t give up. Like on repeat. I was calm and asked her to go to bed . 

Our youngest daughter asked us to stop arguing. I asked her again to go to “her” room and the only thing she was repeating was about that bottle of wine I took from her earlier.

We went in to the kitchen and I was about to just give it to her but instead I took it and started to pour it out in the kitchen sink. Then hell broke loose. Screaming, punching, kicking and after half the bottle I just gave up and gave it to her. 

I sad mean things and started to film her actions with my phone and that triggered more reactions from her and her 7 days of drinking ,it’s no point to argue and It’s no winners at all - I know that but she was about to close her door to her room but I wanted to say more things to her -like that if she leaves tomorrow for more wine she can’t come back and that tonight she crossed another level and I can’t accept this. She just screams that I have to leave her alone like one sentence on repeat and I need to let her close the door and she kicked me, and I pushed her. And she falls. A normal person would not fall,  but after 7 days of drinking she falls and looks at me like a tried to kill her. 
She lays down in the sofa and I left.

I’m in my bed drinking coffee writing this. She’s in her sofa drinking wine behind a closed door. Kids sleeping again and it’s 05.50  in the morning. I’m so sad and regretful that this happened so the kids had to hear this. 
This is the first time this kind of reaction happened. Totally unnecessary and I feel such a shame that I lost my temper.
Rant over.

At first we really hit it off and it seemed to be going great. We had a lot of great conversations, and were texting almost constantly. We also talked on the phone a few times and exchanged pictures. This was for about a week, and then we met in person.

It did not go well. I knew pretty much right away I was not feeling it. He was a lot skinnier than I realized, and his energy and mannerisms were just not attractive to me. I made it through the hour of talking and then I pretty much told him that I wasn’t feeling it and then left. We had plans to do more activities after coffee, but I cancelled them. I felt horrible but I could not fake it through more hanging out. 

He was really hurt. Things had been going so well over the phone and he seemed so happy and excited about it. I did warn him that I wasn’t sure if I was going to be feeling it in person or not. But I don’t think either of us expected it to be that bad. And I had been excited to, I was caught up in the fantasy of it.  He texted me later and mentioned he was drinking. I then woke up the next morning to a text from him saying he was gonna kill himself. 

I did not respond and called the cops to do a wellness check on him. They did and said he was okay just really drunk. I did not hear from him the next day and that night I blocked his number bc I was worried he might drunk text me more stuff. 

It’s been a few days now and I’ve had him blocked still so I don’t know if he’s tried to contact me or not. It just freaked me out that he seemed unstable so now I don’t want to talk to him. But I also feel bad. I led him on cause I thought I was feeling it. And then we meet and I basically ran away. It was mean but I just had to get out of there. I feel like such an idiot for letting our talks be so flirty and emotionally intimate without actually knowing if I was really attracted to this person. And he ended up getting really hurt. I feel awful. So ya just wanted to get that off my chest I guess. I learned my lesson and most definitely won’t be doing that again. ",40,1731990769.0,self,70,0.8,False

1guozdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTrackDays/comments/1guozdh/evolving_my_tracking_hobby_with_fatherhood/,Evolving my tracking hobby with fatherhood,"TL:DR This is a question about finding the right car to match this stage of life - SS 1LE or FL5 Type R. 

First some details: I've participated in HPDE for the last 14 years beginning when I was 18. I love this hobby and I am fortunate to be living out this childhood dream of mine. For the past 5 years I've become an instructor with multiple groups (NASA, PCA, PBOC) and co-own a car in a w2w endurance series. Before kids I averaged 4-6 HPDE/TT events and 3 w2w endurance races each year. For HPDE I have been driving my AP1 S2000 and the race car is a Spec E30 modified to run ChampCar Endurance Series. 

My wife and I welcomed by our first born over the summer and we decided to take a step back from the track. The cars have sat collecting dust and that's ok.. it was the plan. I've realized I will probably never have the time I had prior to kids to dedicate to tracking until maybe they move out of the house many years from now. 

What I also realize is I have a lot of money wrapped up in 1 car/setup that I now never drive - the s2000. I have devloped it for 6 years and it is an extremely capable track car with an extensive modification list. Although fast on track it is competent at very little else. Of course, it's a joy to drive every time I jump behind the wheel. But life has changed, and fatherhood has pulled me away from going to the track with my S2000 as often as I used to. It has 6 point harnesses with no airbags I don't drive it much on the street. 

This is where I need some help finding a possible replacement that can serve me better for this stage in life. My mind is between a Camaro SS 1LE and a FL5 Civic Type R. Both are radically different paths. On the street I’ve driven both (’23 Type R and ’18 2SS 1LE). I've instructed in a 1LE on track. Both cars satisfy what I'm looking for: A car that is very capable on track but also very fun on the street that provides me the flexibility to fit infant & toddler car seats over the coming years as my daughter grows. I'm open to consider other options in a $40-50k range. Isofix child seats attachments are a must. 

Type R -  Track weekends, cars and coffee, or just errand trips around town would now become a family event and that's valuable for me. That is where I feel the FL5 Type R shines. With more time spent away from the track, joy needs to be found in the mundane street drive or day trip to the mountains or beach with the family. With the versatility of the hatchback it's an attractive package. If baby #2 comes it's ready to handle it. It's very quick (not fast) with layers of personality. Some of the touch points have big s2000 vibes.. I haven’t owned a FWD chassis car since 2015 (old accord I had in college) and learning those driving dynamics on track with a FL5 Type R could be a fresh new challenge to master and enjoy. The only modifications I would do involve cooling support, wheels/tires/brakes. 

SS 1LE - For track use the S2000 leaves big shoes to fill. What I value about the AP1’s rawness is that I need to push myself to a limit of clean driving and consistency that leaves me fizzing for days after. I feel this is where the Camaro would shine over the Type R as its F/R chassis is sublime. It has the equipment to dominate a track weekend and its E-diff feels very similar to the KAAZ LSD in my S2k. The torque around town is.. addicting. It can fit 1 rear face child seat behind the passenger seat. Although totally fine for around town errands or school droppoffs it would never be a family trip car. 
 
Comparative lap times around my home track VIR would be:
Camaro SS 1LE – 2:04/2:05
S2000 – 2:08/9s
Type R – 2:10/11s

If I buy a 1LE, I would intend to keep my truck and trailer as the versatility of the truck would still be needed with having the Camaro. If I buy the FL5 Type R, I will think about selling the truck and trailer because I originally bought them for the s2000. I would use our CX-50 to tow our smaller utility trailer for any big Home Depot runs so the versatility of the truck won’t be missed as much as one may think. I work from home so my daily mileage is quite low. My wife loved her manual hatchback Mazda3 so she is more attracted to the Type R but has left this decision up to me. She would be happy with both options. 

Other platforms that work on paper include:
CT4V Blackwing - 2022/3 models are seemingly within budget range but I worry about the actual back seat size. It seems very small. 
BMW f80 M3 - same concerns as the Blackwing with rear seat size. Maybe I'm wrong here. 
GR86 – I had a student with one and I was impressed. Not sure if it's big enough for rear facing child seat. Seeing the oil pressure solution with larger aftermarket oil pans is promising. 
GT350/S550 GT – I coached a student on track with a GT350 and I was very impressed. However, we spun a rod bearing while driving casually on the street and I would always worry about the motor even with an extended warranty. I am not a fan of the MT82 after owning a S550 GT in the past. 
Porsche 911 – The only viable option is 991.1 or newer due to the isofix child seat mount requirement and those are just out of budget. I loved our 996 but I don’t like how you need to use the seatbelt with car seats with 996/997s. I've seen OK setups for front facing car seats but not much for rear facing. 
BMW M2 - I have zero experience with these. 

At the end of the day both 1LE and Type R really impressed me and felt special in very different ways. If the choice was yours and you have children in your life which would you lean towards and why?

I'm new to cold brew and have been reading brewing experiences from this sub. To try things out, I recently made two batches of cold brew using coarse coffee grounds of natural processed beans from Sumatra, Indonesia. I used a 1:9 coffee-to-water ratio by weight. One jar was left in the fridge, and the other on the counter, both for 14 hours. After filtering with paper filters, I noticed:

Fridge Brew: Richer taste with cherry, plum, and wine-like acidity. Mild bitterness.

Countertop Brew: Overwhelming bitterness and ""coffee"" nutty intensity, like it had over-extracted. Barely tasted other notes.

I definitely preferred the taste of the fridge brew. Has anyone else experimented with this? Any tips or advice on getting the best flavor/notes? Thanks.",5,1731990286.0,coldbrew,2,1.0,False

So I've been using the Eureka Mignon Filtro grinder (50mm flat burr) for several years now, and pretty much dialed in a consistently great cup of Aeropress XL coffee. I was, however, able to get a deal of 10% off the DF64 Gen 2 (55mm DLC flat burr), so I took my chance on it.

Here is my recipe based off James Hoffman's recipe that's been working for me:  
\- 23g coffee (usually medium roast) at medium-fine or a 5 (x2 rotations on the Eureka)

\- 400ml water at 198F

\- 10 second pour then seal

\- 2:00 minute brew

\- Shake/swirl

\- 30 seconds brew

\- Press until hiss then back off.

Using the coffee beans (Currently Atlas Coffee's Tanzania Medium Roast), I was able a bit of stronger flavor from the Eureka Mignon grind than the DF64 II. The DF64 II is very mild and curiously a bit hotter in temperature, too. I almost have to concentrate to taste the flavor from the DF64 II coffee.

I tried matching the grind sizes to the Mignon at around 50, and played around 55 and 45 grind setting, too, but it's about the same. Should I go finer or coarser? Is this a case of I have to season the burrs a bit?",1,1731990172.0,AeroPress,0,0.67,False

1guou1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1guou1g/must_do_in_kona_hawaii/,Must Do In Kona Hawaii?,"Hey there fellow travelers! 

I just got back from an incredible trip to Kona, Hawaii and I absolutely need to share my experiences with you all. The Big Island's western coast is pure magic, and I've discovered some amazing activities that you definitely shouldn't miss.

First off, you've got to experience the manta ray night dive or snorkel. It's absolutely mind-blowing! I booked through this site https://athometouch.com/hawaii and it was super smooth. These gentle giants glide right beneath you while you float on the surface - it's surreal and totally safe.

The Kona coffee farms are another must-visit. I'm a huge coffee enthusiast, and touring these farms was fascinating. You get to see the entire process from bean to cup, and the samples are incredible. The mountain views don't hurt either!

Speaking of views, don't skip Mauna Kea. The sunset from up there is otherworldly, and the stargazing afterward? Unreal. Just make sure to bring warm clothes - it gets surprisingly chilly up there.

Beach-wise, Magic Sands Beach is perfect for boogie boarding and swimming. The sand literally disappears during high tide (hence the name). And if you're into snorkeling, head to Kahalu'u Beach Park - the sea turtles there are so chill!

For history buffs, Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park (City of Refuge) is fascinating. Ancient Hawaiian culture comes alive here, and the carved wooden ki'i (statues) are impressive.

One activity that really surprised me was the night snorkel with manta rays. I know I mentioned it before, but it deserves a second shoutout. You can book this and other awesome activities at https://athometouch.com/hawaii - they've got some great deals and this cool rewards program where you earn money back for future adventures.

The local food scene is incredible too. Make sure to try some poke bowls (Da Poke Shack is amazing), grab a plate lunch from a local joint, and don't skip the malasadas (Hawaiian donuts)!

Last tip: rent a car. The Big Island is, well, big, and you'll want to explore beyond Kona proper. The freedom to discover hidden beaches and local spots is totally worth it.

Nothing says “I respect my neighbors” like pulling into your street at midnight, blasting bass-heavy tunes loud enough to rattle my furniture. It doesn’t even sound like music, just loud noises. Look, I get it—you had a long day at your probably soul-sucking job, but my sleep schedule didn’t sign up to be in attendance. 
	4.	The Dirt Bike Daredevils: And how could I forget the kids zipping through traffic? You guys can really put engines on anything, eh? Who needs peace and quiet when you can have the sweet symphony of revving motors. It’s like Mad Max out here, but with shittier modes of transportation.
