When I married my husband, his little girl became my greatest treasure. We were BFFs right away; we love fairies, flowers, ballet and opera, clothes and dressing up, pink and purple, dolls, girly pop music, and everything cute and fuzzy.



For years, she asked me when I was going to have a baby and give her a little sister. The whole time her dad and I were trying to conceive, I envisioned a team of spunky little girls to make flower crowns with us and find bugs and rocks and birdwatch and wear matching outfits.   



When I found out I was pregnant, all I cared about was having a healthy baby and didn't care about the gender. But as the weeks went on, I was convinced it was going to be a girl! I only craved sweet things, I seemed to be carrying high (at first), I had morning sickness, and the heart rate during ultrasounds was always 140+. I felt such a strong, motherly connection to the baby and my own femininity that I just knew I was growing a sister!



Then, on Father's Day, I sent the blood test results for my friend to make us a little gender reveal cake (vanilla for girl, chocolate for boy). I was craving chocolate that day so I joked that it's too bad it's definitely a girl because I want that chocolate cake üòÇ 



When my husband cut into the cake and I saw that (delicious) chocolate, the main feeling coursing through me was SHOCK. I had been convinced!! Then, to my shame, the smallest bit of disappointment. It wasn't going to be a sister who we could put in matching dresses and dance around a Maypole (lol). It was going to be a little boy, and wtf am I going to do with a boy?? I didn't have brothers, my male cousin who was closest with me is gay and never liked anything stereotypically masculine, what if the baby loves trucks?? We don't attribute interests to specific gender, but how do I support his interests if they end up being something I can't relate to?



Fast forward a few months - the baby is coming! A month early!! My water broke at 2 pm and less than 4 hours later, I'm pushing this nugget out completely unmedicated. I felt his 5 lb body shoot out of me and lowkey dissociated for a bit while he lay on my chest. I finally looked down at him.... and his eyes were open, looking right back! He had my husband's eyes. The next night, I had my ""oh wait I'm obsessed with you"" moment when I realized he had my nose and mouth.



Now, he's almost 6 months old and I can't imagine having anything but this little budgie boy. He's beyond perfection. He's always happy, loves people, calmly plays on his tummy and explores his toys, and laughs at everything and everybody. And he sleeps through the night üëÄ



When I look into his dark eyes, I see my husband's eyes looking into mine onstage, under the lights when we were just goofy theatre kids. I see them the day they glittered with tears as I walked down the aisle with my dad toward him at our wedding. 



I see myself in his dark curls and little button nose. When he's asleep, his little rosebud mouth gets all squished up like in my baby pictures. 



I see my grandmother in his fat cheeks and round little chin. When I kiss those cheeks, I remember being in my grandmother's kitchen. I remember feeding her birds in the back garden and always having a dish of orange sherbet as a treat or warm coffee cake for breakfast. 



And maybe best of all, I hear his sister, my little partner in crime, in his happy giggles. They absolutely adore each other, and she makes him laugh all day every day. 



Every night (and most naptimes), my sweet baby boy falls asleep in my arms, nursing. As he is drifting off, he takes his chubby little index finger and traces it around on my shoulder, my wrist, whatever he can touch. He strokes and squeezes and holds onto my skin and feels so safe and warm as he falls asleep. I press kisses onto his soft face and hair. It is the greatest peace and joy that I will ever know.



So, in conclusion, as a complete girly girl who did have my gender disappointment moment, I would be THRILLED to be having another boy. My son is my sunshine (sonshine üåû), my pride and joy, my funny smiley giggly baby boy and I will learn every model of train there is if I have to!! And if he wants to make flower crowns with us too, nothing would make me happier.

The way the annoying emo girl (Starfire's daughter) runs away from home was identical to how I did it in high school.

I didn't had any friends, I didn't know any places to go. The nearest coffee shop was the safest option. And I'm embarrassed about how much of a coward I was.

My personality is way far from what I want to be and it will always be that way. I can never change how I was in the past, my past will always be my biggest shame.

The girl in the comic looks exactly like how I avoid to look and act, yet I can find myself experiencing the same things as her, and seeing somebody making fun of how cowardly and pathetic it was.

**Sex and the City Was About Relationships. And Just Like That‚Ä¶ Has Become About Money**

by: David Mack


*Three seasons in, the sequel series‚Äîlike its characters‚Äîhas gotten way too comfortable.*

And just like that, ‚ÄúAnd Just Like That‚Ä¶‚Äù is back for its third season on HBO Max, the streaming platform that‚Äôs gone through almost as many branding changes as Samantha Jones has lovers. 

And, much like the relationship between Sex and the City and its fatigued revival/sequel series, things still feel similar, yet different this time around‚Äîsometimes eerily so. The new season, which premieres on Thursday night, opens with the patron saint of ‚ÄúWest Village girls,‚Äù Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), sitting and writing, as she is wont to do, by a window. 

The space she‚Äôs in looks somewhat similar to the iconic studio apartment she gave up at the end of Season 2, down to the coffee table and the walk-through closet. But then, as she dons a pink tulle coat to go with the pink tulle dress she‚Äôs wearing (apparently to go to the post office?!), we get the reveal: 

Carrie is actually in her new townhome in Manhattan‚Äôs pricey Gramercy Park neighborhood, complete with tasteful wall moldings, custom floor inlays, a state-of-the-art alarm system, and a sweeping staircase that connects its two grand levels. Long gone are the days when our girl was using the oven as a place to store sweaters and had less than $1,000 in her savings account.

Carrie‚Äôs new digs, alongside other changes this season, illustrate the key problem with ‚ÄúAnd Just Like That‚Ä¶‚Äù

With the departures of the ‚Äúqueer nonbinary Mexican Irish diva‚Äù podcast host Che (Sara Ram√≠rez) and Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman), the Columbia Law School professor who befriended Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) ostensibly out of pity, AJLT has now lost its only two vaguely middle-class characters. 

(Not to mention that their loss represents a step back for a show that was desperately trying to diversify itself, although thankfully we still have plenty of facetime with Sarita Choudhury‚Äôs glamorous realtor Seema Patel).

Three seasons in, AJLT is firmly and unabashedly a show about some of the wealthiest women in New York and their trivial rich-people problems. If SATC was once a revolutionary show about sex and dating, AJLT is now too often a series about money and the carefree lifestyle that wealth provides the leisure class. 

Certainly, these characters aren‚Äôt facing the same problems they were several decades ago‚Äînor do we expect them to. They‚Äôre older now, more settled, and dealing with teenage children or widowhood. 

But I, like other viewers, find myself coming back to these beloved characters out of obligation and curiosity, not for any real excitement or wonder. In its third season, AJLT is more content than ever plodding along (albeit in Manolos) as little more than a pedestrian fantasy that‚Äôs lost most of the spunk and spark of the original series. Like its characters‚Äô lives, AJLT is just ‚Ä¶ comfortable.

The series isn‚Äôt the only TV show to center on the well-moneyed, to be sure. 

HBO Max alone has, in recent years, given us The White Lotus,Succession, Industry, Hacks, The Other Two, and a Gossip Girl reboot. 

But those shows‚Äîsave for that last one, perhaps‚Äîhave something pointed to say about their wealthy characters and their glitzy lifestyles. 

Conversely, in AJLT, money is simply the backdrop that enables our heroines to enjoy a series of fabulous if mundane adventures. 

In the six episodes of this new season made available to critics, for example, fans can expect such thrilling storylines as Charlotte (Kristin Davis) having to search for a new dog walker because of Upper East Side gossip, as well as trying to hire a cutthroat college admissions guide to get daughter Lily (Cathy Ang) into an Ivy League school. 

Carrie, meanwhile, spends much of the season pining over a designer dining table, relandscaping her garden, or trying to replace a pane of antique glass. She‚Äôs already had to wait six months for fabric for her chaise longue, she tells us. 

The horror!

Oddly enough, AJLT now feels closer not to SATC, but to HBO‚Äôs period show ‚ÄúThe Gilded Age.‚Äù

The two series sharing Nixon as a star aside, both are escapist soaps where fashion is paramount, and not much else happens besides a few romances. 

(Last season, The Gilded Age opened with a thrilling montage of Easter hats, while this season AJLT serves up a medley of Carrie walking in dozens of high heels that terrorize her downstairs neighbor, set to the song ‚ÄúThese Boots Are Made for Walkin‚Äô.‚Äù) 

Still, at least the upstairs-downstairsnature of The Gilded Age means that the show has to, at a minimum, pretend to care about its poorer servant characters before treating us once again to the prettier rich-lady costumes. 

It‚Äôs a balanced diet, while AJLT is all sugar all the time. 

In one scene this season, Charlotte wears a massive string of pearls while her friend Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) wears a jacket dripping in pearls from practically every seam. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre having a pearl-off!‚Äù I said to no one in particular.

Were these characters always so self-involved? (I already know the answer.) 

Carrie is, of course, the textbook embodiment of ‚Äúmain character syndrome,‚Äù so it‚Äôs not that surprising to see her treat her downstairs neighbor with such disdain, equating the idea of walking around her timber floors while not wearing heels to having her feet amputated. 

She also spends significant chunks of time obsessing over the meaning of a thumbs-up emoji from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Aidan (John Corbett). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to seem ridiculous. His family‚Äôs in crisis and I‚Äôm obsessing about an emoji,‚Äù she says in one small, blessed flash of self-awareness.


The best parts of this season come when Carrie decamps to Virginia to visit Aidan on his farm, leaving behind the trappings and trapdoors of big-city life. 

Despite the two being in love, Aidan moved back there at the end of Season 2 to live with his teenage sons, one of whom is going through a particularly rough period. 

He had asked Carrie for a five-year pause in their relationship‚Äîa freeze that initially stifles any real plots for Carrie this season. 

But once they reconnect properly, we see a newer side to Carrie. Fans of SATC will recall how Carrie behaved like a brat when she had to be dragged by her designer heels to Aidan‚Äôs upstate New York cabin in Season 4‚Äôs ‚ÄúSex and the Country.‚Äù 

This time, though, she‚Äôs more serene and just seems happy to be with him. Hell, she even rides an ATV at one point. Watching Carrie interact with Aidan‚Äôs sons is moving, not just because it‚Äôs a side of her we haven‚Äôt seen before, but also because she‚Äôs genuinely deferential (maybe for the first time ever?) to his family. 

One tense dinner, in particular, stands out because of her poise.

It‚Äôs in these scenes that Carrie shows real growth and a wisdom that can only come with age, which feels like when AJLT comes closest to its raison d‚Äô√™tre. It‚Äôs rare to see women in their 50s and 60s explored on television, with their still-in-flux lives proof that they‚Äôre not completely dead and settled yet. What do you do with your life, like Carrie, when your partner dies just as you‚Äôre entering your autumn years? Or how should you navigate, like one character has to this season, a troubling health diagnosis for a loved one?

‚ÄúI loved everything as it was, but now that‚Äôs all changed, so I don‚Äôt know what comes next,‚Äù Carrie tells a landscaper about her garden, in words that could apply to both her life and AJLT itself, at its best and most urgent.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exciting‚Äînot knowing,‚Äù he tells her. 

‚ÄúBecause then what is meant to be has the space to show up.‚Äù

Yet, just like Carrie sitting at her computer and staring out her bedroom window, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder ‚Ä¶ what if this show aimed this high all the time? 

What if the scales tipped away more often than not from the pretty in favor of this ugly side of life? 

What if, instead of fantasy, AJLT leaned even further into the reality that it‚Äôs so good at touching on, in the rare moments that it dares to?

Maybe it‚Äôs a me problem. 

Maybe I‚Äôm misreading the audience here. 

Maybe what we‚Äôre all craving in these dark times is a trifling distraction about ladies who lunch. Lord knows that I will keep tuning in, and probably will until each of these characters is sent off in an understated coffin topped with tasteful, all-white flowers. 

‚ÄúI cannot look away,‚Äù Miranda says this season of some low-culture TV show she‚Äôs come to embrace against her better nature. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve finally discovered the joy of hate-watching.‚Äù 

You and me both, Miranda.

I wanted to take some time to share my story of how i got mold poisoning back in October 2024 and explain what i did to get back to 90% normal. I know every case its different but i really wanted to take the time to write everything in as much detailed as possible since what i went through was very hard and traumatic and i want people who are currently going through this to know the symptoms and step i took so that they know its not the end of the world and that they are not alone/crazy. 

  
I moved to this apartment in Coral Gables back in July 2024, i consider myself a very active healthy individual who would go to the gym 4-5 times on average per week, rarely drank and ate somewhat decent. The apartment that i moved into was a very very nice one, paying around $3800 per month almost. 

I moved in July 22, 2024, for the first month i did not notice a single symptom, i started a tech startup Dec 2023 and when i moved in to the new apt i was working out of the apt 95% of the time. Here is what happened. 

Month 1 - no symptoms, ive always been a heavy caffeine abuser since working in tech demands a lot of brain power and energy so id consume around 400-500mgs of caffeine daily from pre-workout to coffee and yerba mate. So 30 days in and no symptoms at all.

Month 2 - August 30, still no major symptoms but out of nowhere i started to notice constant runny nose every morning and sneezing to the point my roommate started to notice. At first i thought it wasnt anything major. Id wake up around 9-10AM and go straight to my laptop and start ny work day, skipping breakfast sometimes until 1PM and having coffee right after waking up, that was my routine.

Month 3 - September 30, at this point i started to notice mild fatigue, like i noticed id start going to bed earlier and earlier and waking up at the same time but felt somewhat unrested. I thought it was burnout from working 12-14hr shifts on my company. I never suspected of burnout since i really really love my job and the project we are building so i thought it was just exhaustion from either the gym or from long hours of work. One night i came back home from a meeting and i noticed it was around 10AM i was feeling very very sleepy / tired and was in the couch talking to my roommate about the meeting i just had, told him i was going to bed because i felt super tired and he gave me magnesium glycinate and electrolite drops to put on my water. The next day i woke up very good actually and thought i was back to normal. 

Month 4 - October 5, this is where things started to get weird, i woke up one morning, and like usual i went straight to my workstation and began work, an hour after i woke up and started working i remember me trying to show my roommate a new wireframe i had made for this new app we were building and mid way of me explaining him what it was i got EXTREMELY lightheaded and a weird cold feeling in my stomach like when you avoid a car crash and you get the adrenaline rush right after. I started running out of breath and stood up, my roommate immediately noticed and asked if i was ok, i said i was ok and started walking towards the balcony and opened the sliding door to get fresh air, as i stepped outside i rember my feel started to wobble and i began getting very shaky / anxious and at first i thought i just needed food, perhaps my sugar levels had dropped. 

I told my roommate to go to thegym for a run, maybe thats what i needed since i had drank half a yerba mate (around 100mgs of caffeine) on an empty stomach, and as we were walking towarrds the elevator i started to feel a panic attack, which was weird because ive never had any! i started to panic just thinking about the fact i was about to hop inside an elevator. Made it downstairs to the gym and began running. Somehow the symptom calmed a bit but i was still feeling like my body was trying to faint but it wouldnt faint. So i decided to go upstairs after 20-30mins of being at the gym fighting for my life lol.

I went upstairs and decided to take a really hot shower and that made everything much better and then out of nowhere, i got extremely energy drained to the point i couldnt keep my eyes open and had to take a nap, this was around 2PM. 

  
October 10, i went over to this place restaurant down the street of my apt complex to grab some breakfast around 11AM and as soon as we sat down i started to feel the cold adrenaline feeling again without any trigger, started to feel light headed and anxiety. I thought my blood sugar was dropping again and as soon as i got my food i stated eating it hoping it would make my faint symptoms go away. I remember i stood up and went to the restroom and started to feel worse to the point i told my roommate i was leaving since i was afraid i would faint in the middle of a restaurant. Walked outside and started waking back and as we were about to enter the building again, the symptoms got wayyy worse with extreme anxiety and adrenaline not being able to controll it. Walked inside and had to sit in the lobby until the symptoms calmed down then walked to my apt, as soon as we walked in i sat in the couch and out of nowhere another energy drain episode, got up, took a shower and went to bed around  2PM again and woke up around 4PM.

  
Couple days later my friend came over to record and as we were getting ready to record and started to activate my brain i started to feel weird again and told her i wasnt feeling ok so we canceled and i explained to her what i was going through, how i felt weak, fatigued etc and she recommended to take iron supplements. So i got up and went to walgreens to buy some and as soon as i walked inside the store i started to feel weird again, so much stimulation would make my faint symptoms worse and was shaky to the point i thought i was going to faint in line at walgreens. 

Made it back to my apt, took the pills and hoped for the best, the next 2-3 days got a bit better energy wise and thought i was just low on iron and thought that was the issue. Still didnt know i had mold in my apt. Then after taking iron for 5-7 days i began to feel energy drained again and got discouraged, i didnt know what was wrong with me at this point. I remember i decided to go get an IV for all my B vitamins (myers cocktail) and 30 mins after i got my IV i started to feel amazing! like everything smelled great, was laughing out of nowhere on how good the IV was making me feel, the day after was when i realzied there was mold in my apt in the AC ducts and vents but was hidden and couldnt see it. I started inspecting and realized my unit wasnt the only one with mold, it was around 15+ more units and was more of a centra AC system leak issue that was causing mold in the entire building, so even at the gym id be breathing spores. I started inspecting all my neighbors ac filters and units and thats when i found the entire building had it. 

October 31st - final mold attack episode. I remember i woke up one morning after inspecting my neighbors apt and breathing all those spores from all other units and went to grab breakfast at the same restaurant i had my 2nd symptom faint episode, and again, as soon as i sat down right before walking in to the restaurant i got the cold stomach feeling and knew exactly what was coming, another panic / adrenaline attack that i couldnt control. This time was the final major one that landed me calling an ambulance. 

I started to have the biggest adrenaline / faint attack out of all of them that i even started poruing water and ice into my face in the middle of the restaurant, i got up and left without paying since thats how terrible i was feeling, got in my car and then my roomate walked in. We drove off and 3-4 mins driving the symptoms got SO WORSE to the point i decided to stop at an urgent care center to see if they could help me because i was loosing my mind. Walked in, left my car in the middle of the street and i just started rolling in the middl of the urgent care lobby. Some people came out side and checked my vitals, everytime seemed fined and they told me there wasnt much they could do so they called the ambulance as i was almost loosing consciousness.   
  
Ambulance gets there and they load me up and staretd checking my blood, temperature etc. The ambulance guy told me i was totally fine and asked if i consumed any drugs, i told him no, and i explained everything that was happening at my apt but they didnt seem to believe me. He said ""hey man you are completely fine, if you want we can wait here in the ambulance until you feel fine again and then you can walk off because if we take you to the hospital thats going to be 5K just on the ride"" 

I walkd off the ambulance 20 mins later and had my roommate drive me to my friends house, i was walking like if i had just gotten out of back surgery or something, extremely slow and like at .0001% of energy left in my body, like no lie i could not keep my eyes open on how fatigued i was but i also couldnt sleep because of how much pain i was going through. I get to my friends house and explained everything to their parents and the mom told me to just lay in the couch. 30 mins later with all my strenght i got up and walked down the stairs to the kitchen, took me like 10 mins to walk down. I see the mom in the kitchen and i was so close of asking her to call an ambulance because of how terrible i was feeling, i started to feel so emotionally defeated and then as a last resource i decided to ask her if she could make me a tea, i remember she made me a ginger tea with wild honey and half a lemon which after 20 mins of drinking it i swear it brought my energy levels from .0001% to almost 5-10% and i noticed the energy boost. 

I called my roommate to pick me up and that night i spent it sleeping in my car since i knew where the source of my getting sick was coming from. 

I left my apt October 31st at night after the ambulance event and never came back, for weeks i started to feel worse for some reason, these were my symptoms after i left the apartment:

WEIRD BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS  
BODY TEMPERATURE REGULATION ISSUES, like my body struggled to keep my body either cool or warm everytime i switched enviroments from cold to hot.   
FATIGUE through the roof  
VERTIGO  
ANXIETY ATTACKS  
FAINT SYMPTOOMS every morning after waking up  
BRAIN FOG  
WEAKNESS  
EXTREMELY LOW MOTIVATION  
LOW VITAMIN D Levels  
HIGH HEMOGLOBINS  
LOW TESTOSTERONE  
THYROID LEVELS LOW  
DEPERSONALIZATION & DERELIZATION  
  
and many more i cant recall. 

  
What i did to regain my life back to 90%  
  
I read every mold remedy and detox i could get my hands on and studied how it affects your brain and and body and how to get rid of it. 

Here is what i learned:

You have to leave the mold place first, thats priority!   
  
Start sleeping more, even if you sleep 9-10hrs and still feel tired, sleep more!  
  
Eat clean, no process foods, sugars, etc. Mold disturbs your gut microbes and its usually where most mycotoxins are stored, besides your fat and liver.

SWEAT! - so the reason i was having these morning sickness for the first 2-3hrs of my days was because of my lymphatic system being overwhelmed through the night, your blood has a heard that pumps it around, your lymphatic system  does not, you have to drain it every day by sweating, and moving around. Thats where toxins are stored, so in order to feel better you have to move and sweat.

Drink a lot of water and teas, Ginger, Turmeric, Dandelion, green tea, Moringa  
  
Cut regular coffee since they can contain Ochratoxin A from coffee beans, a form of mold that is found in grains. 

Dairy will trigger histamine reactions making you feel anxiety or burning feeling in your lower back area and extreme internal inflammation that you will confuse it with a mold flare. 

take supplements but start with the basic ones like:   
Omega-3,   
CoQ-10,   
Vitamnin B-12,   
Ashwaganda ksm-66,   
Vitamin d3+k2 (this one helped me the most! mold lowers your vitamin d levels giving you extreme fatigue and low motivation)  
Iron   
Magnesium Glycinate

These are the starter ones

Then i started to take these by month 4-5 of my detox journey

Lione Mane, but take half dose only, and take it every 2 days.   
Gaba  
Zinc

  
For pure detox id be a little careful with these as they can trigger extreme flares if you just got out of your moldy environment 

NAC but take Activated Charcoal 2hrs after taking NAC  
Moringa

NAC is a precursor of Glutathione, the most important antioxidant that your liver releases to remove metals and toxins from your blood / body. If you are still sentitive to mold and you take NAC your body will release toxins into your bloodstream and you will have a flare, learned this the hard way. 

So start slow, wait 1-2 months after you are out of the mold environment to start taking NAC & moringa with charcoal. 

Once you can tolerate it more take it, NAC will make you feel really good! you will feel like shit at first for the first 3-5 days but after that you will see a huge difference in energy levels and mood. 

Lions Mane will help you restore the damage neuropaths from brain damage caused by imflamation. Your vestibular will start to repair once you stay consistent with vitamin d3+k2, thats what causes the vertigo and weird imbalance feelings. You will notice the energy improvements by day 8-10 if you are low on vitamin D, im my cause i was on low 30's for vitamin D, which is extremely low for males. 

SWEAT SWEAT SWEAT

Cold Showers, 2 ginger teas every day minimum, and taking Magnesium Glycinate before going to bed. If you take Zinc, please dont be a dummy like i was and taking it on an empty stomach, it will make you feel weird and nauseous. 

The thing with mold is that any symptom you confuse it with a flare and you have to train your brain to trust your body again as the months pass.

  
By month 4-5 you will feel like you can do normal things again like going to restaurants and not feel anxiety from too much stimulation. 

You will think you will never hear but thats your brain telling you that from exhaustion, mold is mainly neurological, if your brain is bad because of mold you will feel hopeless, but trust me, it till get better. 

Even at month 5 i was still having vertigo, imbalance and weird thoughts of thinking id never recover. Im on month 8 of detox and the only symptoms i feel now is very mild DPDR but its very tolerable now, very very mold vertigo symptoms specially when i move fast or lock eyes on a moving object, but id say is like a 5-10% feeling now, compared to 7 months ago. Brain fog every now and then, but rarely now. 

and to remind you guys again, SWEAT SWEAT SWEAT, activate your lymphatic system every morning even if you feel like death! you will feel soooo much better even with just 10-15 min walks on the thread mill. At first it feels like you're dying but then you feel so much better!! 

Remember this is a slow but gradual journey, If you cut caffeine cold turkey like i did you will feel sleepy by 7-8PM, dont confuse it with a symptom or an illness, its just your body finally feeling real tired instead of coffee masking the energy levels. 

I drink Keffir for gut health, focusing on gut health is one of the most important things to do id say. Take your binders first thing in the AM, like as soon as you open your eyes and wait at least 1 hr before eating or taking any supplement as activated charcoal will bind to anything, including good supplements. 

  
i hope im not forgetting anything, you are not alone and its totally common to go thorugh all these symptoms as you heal, feel free to DM me if you have any questions. ",1,1748715063.0,ToxicMoldExposure,0,1.0,False

[XRP Protocol Series]


Entry One: Why Oracles Matter

If you have ever wondered what keeps the digital world spinning and what actually underpins those wild swings in value or the smooth flow of settlement, you will find your answer not in code alone, but in the flow of information itself. The fire of Prometheus, if you like your metaphors, is alive and well today. These days it pulses as data, flickering through the digital arteries that bind us all.

Every advance we make gives us something and, as you might expect, takes something away. We have gotten so good at protecting digital assets with quantum-secure vaults and cryptographic fortresses that sometimes we forget to look at the foundation. What if the very evidence we cherish and protect is unreliable? In this game, proof only matters if you trust the source. Maybe the most valuable asset is not even what is in your wallet, but what you are willing to believe.

Picture The Arbiter, that mechanical judge, enforcing rules with a precision no human can match. But just as often, lurking in the background, stands The Oracle. Sometimes a witness, sometimes a trickster, always the hidden hand that decides what is real. Every contract and every digital handshake is only as good as the truth being fed into it.

In today‚Äôs world, information is more precious than gold and it is so much easier to poison. It makes you wonder: can trust really be programmed? Is it possible to engineer truth itself? There is that old paradox. The higher we build, the more faith we are forced to place in things we cannot see and sometimes things we can barely verify.

Look under the hood of any digital contract or bridge or fancy new asset, and what do you find? Data, humming along, the unseen lifeblood of finance. Oracles, in their ancient role, used to hand down truth from on high. Now, they tell our smart contracts what is real. Prices, weather, identity, all piped in from a world the blockchain itself cannot observe.

The reality is this: blockchains cannot function without a reliable stream of real-world information. A price feed determines whether a payment clears. An oracle confirms that conditions have been met before a tokenized home is sold. It is all very practical until it is not, and if you have seen what happens when that data is wrong, you know the stakes. Fortunes can be lost in seconds. Contracts break and faith crumbles. In the end, all the clever code in the world means nothing if the whisper behind the curtain cannot be trusted.

Entry Two: The Old Oracle Problem

This is not a new dilemma. Long before Satoshi or smart contracts, people worried about whether they could trust the message or the messenger. Ancient oracles could change the fate of kings, but only if their vision was true. Fast forward, and we are facing the same riddle in new clothes.

Early crypto builders, maybe in their excitement, underestimated just how fragile this chain of trust could be. The first oracles were often just a single API, run by a person or two, vulnerable to mistakes, bribes, or the wrong weather on the wrong day. It worked for tiny projects, sure, but once real value entered the scene, the cracks were impossible to ignore.

Take the bZx exploit in 2020 as an example. By nudging the price feed, an attacker drained nearly a million dollars, all in the time it takes to brew a coffee. Synthetix, another big player, watched as millions in synthetic assets appeared out of nowhere because of a bad oracle price. Even a garden-variety outage or a misconfigured API can turn into a disaster, as the Compound protocol learned in 2021.

What ties all these failures together is not just bad luck or bad code. It is the misplaced belief that one source or even a few could act as the final word on what is true. The urge for speed and convenience led too many builders to trust in sand instead of stone. When that trust broke, it was not just money on the line. Each exploit chipped away at the promise of a trustless future.

For XRP and its growing network, the message is obvious. Tokenizing property, stocks, or even state-backed money means the price of a faulty oracle is not a single lost transaction. It is market chaos. Regulatory headaches. Settlement failure on a global scale. The oracle problem does not go away. It just waits for its next opportunity.

Building for this world means more than patching bugs. It means rethinking how we build trust from the ground up.

Entry Three: The New Oracle Wars

Every exploit brought new lessons. It became clear that old habits would not cut it anymore. Data feeds could no longer come from a single, trusted gatekeeper. We needed a new way, and that is where decentralized oracles made their entrance.

Chainlink is the one you will hear about most often. They set the standard by drawing data from a whole network of providers, each with a reputation to lose if things go sideways. Sergey Nazarov put it bluntly: ‚ÄúTruth in data is not a feature‚Äîit is the essence.‚Äù When enough eyes are watching, cheating becomes expensive and easy to spot.

Even the new model is not perfect. Critics point out that Chainlink‚Äôs node network, at times, clusters too much power with a few big operators. Emergency controls still exist, and as any engineer will tell you, all backdoors are dangerous in the wrong hands. We are better off than before, but the system is not bulletproof.

Enter Flare, bringing its own twist. Flare‚Äôs network of independent data providers, the FTSOs, compete to deliver accurate, real-time information, all in public view. With cryptographic proofs and open-source code, Flare pushes for a system anyone can inspect. Rewards are lined up so that honesty pays, and the whole thing is built to discourage centralization.

Ripple and XRPL developers are watching closely, with good reason. When you are aiming to tokenize trillions in value, the oracles you choose are just as important as the code that holds your network together.

It is worth mentioning that the battle over oracles is not just technical. In 2022, when geopolitical tension rattled global markets, even some of the best data feeds hiccuped or went offline. When a few actors control too much of the truth, risk spills over into the whole system. This is not just about technology. It is about power, regulation, and economic security.

The bottom line for projects like XRP and Flare is to build with vision, but build with caution. The strength of a network rests on the data flowing through it, and trust is something you have to keep earning, every block, every day.

Interlude: The Silent War

If you are picturing all this as a straight-up battle between codebases, think again. The real contest is quieter, unfolding behind the scenes. Projects jostle for the best partnerships, jockey to be the trusted source for the next wave of DeFi or digital assets, and sometimes wage subtle campaigns to win hearts, minds, and integrations.

Every time a new platform picks its oracle solution, it is drawing a line in the sand. Over time, these alliances shape who leads and who follows, who gets regulatory approval, and who gets left behind.

For XRP and Flare, the choice of oracle is as much about future-proofing as it is about technical superiority. The right connection can open markets. The wrong move can isolate you.

In this shadowy landscape, technology, reputation, and even a little gamesmanship all come into play. Most people will never see these moves, but they shape the reality we all depend on.

Entry Four: The Paradox Unveiled

Here is the question that keeps coming back, no matter how smart the tech gets: can you ever really know what is true?

The latest oracle systems give us better security and more transparency, but there is always a catch. Even with hundreds of independent data feeds, the network is still only as strong as the outside world it is measuring. Deepfakes move markets. Flash crashes distort prices. Bad actors and even governments can try to rig the game.

Transparency is a double-edged sword. Open systems make it easier to catch cheaters, but they also highlight every possible attack surface. Every safeguard you add is one more challenge for a clever attacker to study.

For XRP and Flare, success means more attention and more risk. The more vital these oracles become, the bigger the target painted on their backs. Trust is not just about clever code anymore. It is about building networks, incentives, and even cultures that question, adapt, and verify over and over again.

In the end, the true test of any oracle system is not whether it works on a good day, but how it responds when things go sideways. In a world where every edge can be gamed, what separates hope from reality is the willingness to double-check and to ask tough questions.

Entry Five: Building the Future

Let us be honest, the oracle paradox is never going away completely. The best we can do is learn, adapt, and keep our systems nimble. What Ripple, Flare, and the XRP community are doing goes beyond new protocols. They are building a culture where skepticism and curiosity are strengths, not threats.

On a practical level, that means recruiting more data providers, setting up smarter incentives for honesty, and designing contracts that can cope with uncertainty. It means encouraging audits, embracing tough questions, and making space for debate.

For you and me, the lesson is simple. Trust is a moving target. When you use a digital contract or invest in a platform, you are placing faith in both the code and the community around it.

The future will belong to those who stay alert. The digital systems we are building now will shape tomorrow‚Äôs landscape, one where value moves in seconds and trust is woven into every transaction. The oracle‚Äôs influence, once the stuff of legend, is now a heartbeat running through it all.

Let us use the oracle‚Äôs paradox not as a warning, but as an invitation. There is endless opportunity for anyone willing to stay curious and push forward.

It was going all good between us but one day I had to go home and to my relatives home as well. My family is kinda conservative and I dont pick any calls from my female friends at home, although texts are not any problem. A few days prior to it, I made a promise to my gf that I will surely pick up her call even if it‚Äôs at night and I will tell my mom that my friend had an anxiety attack and wanted to talk to someone, if asked about it. 

So, when I was at my relatives home, I drove the car all day as my relatives had a surgery and I was just doing my job of helping them. Througout the day my phone was on silent as it was connected to cars bluetooth and I did not want them to know that my gf is messaging me again and again. I used to squeeze out some time while parking the car or other stuff to reply to her messages. 

The night came, I asked her to have a small talk as I was exhausted and about to sleep, but she was busy with her friends and was not available. So I just went to sleep at 1am after texting her a goodnight message. I was at my relatives home that night. 

I woke up at 6 in the morning, picked up my phone and saw that there were 13 missed calls from her between 3:30 and 4 am. I was all shocked I messaged her, called her, she pick up and said she is alright and she went back to sleep. I forgot to take off my phone from silent that night. That was a mistake.

Now when I returned back to college, we had a fight over it that I said she can call me anytime but I did not pick up her call that night. She said she really needed me. 
It was my mistake, I said sorry I will not repeat it. All the fights and arguments going smooth, and then she said something. She said that his old friend ‚Äòm‚Äô used to pick up her call even at 3 am. Now this made me angry right at the moment. 

Just a cotext this person ‚Äòm‚Äô was not her ex, but he was his best friend and both of them used to have feelings for each other which were left unsaid and then they both just distanced because of some other girls. Her day used to start with his goodmorning and end at a goodnight to him. This is how strong their bond was.

Coming on to the situation, I got so angry that we kept on fighting all night. And in the morning we slept, when we woke up, she called me and said that she is going on a coffee with this ‚Äòm‚Äô. I wanted to fight again but I did not want another fight. So I said that can I join you? I also knew this guy, I have been sitting with him in lectures straight for a year, but she said no. So, I said okay, just a coffee and you will return back. I said so because it is the last days of our college and she wanted to say a goodbye to everyone with whom she had or has good connections with. 

When she came back, I was excited to meet her and then she told me that she went for coffee at some fine dine and then she drove his car and then she went to his home and met his mom and dad. 

This made me agrier 
and I ended uo fighting with her again. 


And from that day, I have never been the same with her. Our relationship is at the verge of breakup and I find this particular situation to be the cause of it. 

I am really shattered inside that she first compared me to someone whom she loved and then went out with him. 

I asked her why she did it. She simply said she wanted a break from me and nothing else.

I am ready to forgive her but I jist cant get this out of my mind that she compared me to someone and then went out the next day with him. And this fact has hit me everytime when we had sat down and talked about it and made me angry every time and hence the matter is not solved till date.

Been doing a bit of digging and wanted to get your thoughts on Greggs (GRG). We all know them, we probably all love a cheeky pasty or a steak bake from there, but as an investment, I reckon it‚Äôs looking pretty tasty right now.

**What's the Greggs Story?**

For anyone who's somehow missed it, Greggs is the UK's leading bakery food-on-the-go retailer. Think sausage rolls, bacon butties, sandwiches, sweet treats, and increasingly, decent coffee and even a load of vegan options. They've got shops absolutely everywhere ‚Äì high streets, retail parks, industrial estates, and now they‚Äôre popping up in supermarkets and travel hubs too. They're basically a British institution at this point.

**Why I Think Now's an Interesting Time to Get In:**

* **Recession-Resilient (ish):** Let's be honest, when times are a bit tight, people still want affordable treats and convenient food. Greggs hits that sweet spot. Their value proposition is strong.
* **Expansion, Expansion, Expansion:** They're not just sitting still. They‚Äôre still strategically opening new shops, refurbishing older ones, and are cleverly expanding their reach through delivery partnerships and those supermarket freezer aisles. They've also been smart with extended opening hours in many locations.
* **Product Innovation:** They're not afraid to try new things and adapt to changing tastes. The vegan sausage roll was a masterstroke, and they continue to broaden their menu, including more hot food and healthier options.
* **Brand Loyalty:** This is a big one. People genuinely love Greggs. It's a trusted brand with a huge customer base. That's gold in the current market.
* **Strong Recent Performance:** They've been delivering some solid results, showing good sales growth and a clear strategy for the future. They seem to be managing cost inflation pretty well too.

**The Numbers Bit**:

Yearly Numbers

|Metric|FY 2024 (ended Dec 28, 2024)|FY 2023 (ended Dec 30, 2023)|FY 2022 (ended Dec 31, 2022)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Revenue (¬£m)**|2,014|1,810|1,513|
|**Underlying PBT (¬£m)**|189.8|167.7|148.3|
|**Net Store Additions**|116|145|147|
|**LFL Sales Growth (%)**|7.4%|13.7%|17.8%|
|**Underlying Diluted EPS (p)**|137.5|123.8|114.1|
|**Total Ordinary Dividend (p)**|62.0 (16.0p Int, 46.0p Fin)|62.0 (16.0p Int, 46.0p Fin)|59.0 (15.0p Int, 44.0p Fin)|

* **Consistent Growth:** Revenue and underlying profits show sustained year-on-year and generally half-yearly increases.
* **Strong LFL Sales (Normalising):** Robust like-for-like sales growth continues, though recent rates are moderating from prior peaks.
* **Rising EPS:** Earnings per share have steadily increased, reflecting overall profit growth.
* **Growing Dividends:** Reliable ordinary dividends have risen annually, with a special dividend also paid for FY23.

**My Take:**

Look, no investment is a dead cert. There's always competition, rising ingredient costs can be a challenge, and consumer habits can shift. But Greggs seems to be a well-managed company with a strong brand, a clear growth strategy, and a knack for giving people what they want at a decent price.

I'm feeling pretty optimistic about their prospects, but obviously, **this isn't financial advice ‚Äì do your own research (DYOR)!**

What are your thoughts? Is Greggs already in your portfolio? Are you tempted? Let me know what you reckon.

1l03f8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l03f8w,1960‚Äôs Cape to 1920‚Äôs Craftsman Living Room edition‚Ä¶,"Given the requests for interior pics of our DIY renovation, this is a continuation featuring the living room.  The original room was long and narrow with a stair at one end and the front door at the other. The ceiling beams were faux styrofoam. 

We stripped the room to the studs, relocated the front door to the same side as the stair to create a foyer. Took out the old windows and reconfigured the window wall adding new windows. We replaced the pergo planks with oak flooring.  Re-insulated and drywalled the room. We redid all electrical too. So everything was up to code and there‚Äôs plenty of outlets. 

Then came the fun part‚Ä¶adding that craftsman flair.  We started off deciding on a paneled wainscoting and coffered ceiling with builtins and got to work measuring and drafting ideas. 

For the ceiling, we laid out the grid before the drywall Went in to add blocking to allow the framing to be installed once the drywall was in. We then added the coffered ceiling frame frame which is 5/4 pine, followed by the finishes materials.  Everything was cut, sanded and nailed in place. Sometimes clamps were necessary to close all gaps before nailing. We then used crown molding and made reverse picture frames sized to fit the coffee squares to finish the coffers.  

For the wainscoting, we assembled the panels by using off the shelf 1x4 with pocket screws and glue.  We then used a router to create a rabbet around the interior edges and cut 1/4‚Äù maple plywood to fit the openings and stapled it in place. Then tacked and glued the assembled panels to the walls.  The assembled panel is flush on the back so it‚Äôs flush against the drywall so you can‚Äôt dislodge any of the panels. Tricky part was integrating the window and door casings into the wainscoting panel system. That took a ton of measurement. But we were successful.  

After the panels and ceilings were done, we built the cabinets for the builtins to accept a set of vintage doors we found on line for $100. Then we spent a week filling nail holes and sanding everything. Then staining, follows by polyurethane and finally painting.  

The doors for the builtins, the pendant chandelier, and the stained glass windows are all vintage items we repurposed for this room. 

This is my favorite room in the house and while it was a long and tedious process, it was a challenge that stretched my finish carpentry skills to their limits. I‚Äôm proud of this room.  ",2,1748714582.0,DIY,0,1.0,False

Well. Guess what. Today I found out she doesn‚Äôt even drink coffee. What the ü§¨!!!!

All this time she‚Äôs been lying to my face. This is fraudulent. This is betrayal.

I should have seen the signs man. I should have suspected. She‚Äôs lately been getting 4 coffee sends a day, I was already concerned that it‚Äôs a high amount of caffeine per day but I thought it‚Äôs doable for the human body. This past week she‚Äôs been getting 6 coffee sends every day so I had to check if she‚Äôs okay with all that caffeine and she admitted she doesn‚Äôt drink coffee. Like OMFG.

I tried to find a way to feel better about this stab to the back. Was she at least drinking something coffee adjacent like tea or a Monster energy drink?? No, no she was not. She drinks water, like some kind of fish.

I thought she was the one. I‚Äôm so fed up. Where are the real dommes who puts a coffee send on their Throne and then actually drinks coffee. Do I keep looking or just give up?

that was about two months ago. the other day, he texted me congratulating me on graduating. we decided to make plans to get coffee as i was moving home a few days later. that ‚Äúcoffee date‚Äù was earlier this week, and ended up lasting the whole day.

1l03304,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1l03304/hard_times_as_an_aupair/,Hard times as an aupair,"Hi. this is only a vent. I'm 26 and this is my second year aupairing. I'm currently with a family of 3 kids (+parents) and before that I was in a different country with a family of 2 kids. The previous family seemed like nice parents. They'd dismiss me as soon as they got home so they could spend time with their kids and I always had the weekends off. Hardly ever I'd have worked all the hours for the week because they'd usually be home before that, so that was always nice. I was also always happy because the kids were lovely and adored me. (They weren't great people - the parents - but the working conditions were better than now)

Fast forward to this year: my current family puts every hour and some more (they've been paying extra so I'd work more than the hours determined) which is something we agreed to, but it bothers me that they never try to let me go before the scheduled ending time even if both of them are at home, or that I need to work until late on days like Saturday or Sunday so they can go have their leisure time; the kids (even 10 months into it) are usually mean to me regardless of what I do to please them and the parents still try to blame me for it (bc I sometimes ""talk to them too strongly"") and they (parents) also never correct the kids for doing so. I only have another 2 months (that I can't wait to finish) but also I feel completely invisible. They haven't been asking me if I need groceries; don't let me go have my ""me time"" even when I'm literally sitting on a chair staring at a wall because there's nothing else to do; lately they're not even trying to put dirty dishes in the sink and I'm constantly having to clean up after them (even butter they leave open on the table and I need to put back in the fridge, or half opened water bottles on counters); they barely ask how I am and barely make jokes with me lately. I'm the one putting away all the laundry and all the dishes and all the kids toys and all the clean laundry and all the papers and all the mail and all the junk on counters and all the groceries and all the shoes all the 5 people leave around otherwise I almost fall bc I stumble on them.... Ooof

I've been hit, pushed, kicked by one of the kids and this whole experience has left me questioning my mental health for the first time in years. In the past couple weeks I was diagnosed with a mental illness (not only from being an aupair but still) and everything in my life seems heavy. 
     
I hate that I'm the one getting paid 300 euros a month to take care of so many children and also the parents; I hate that if it was anywhere in the global south working +35h a week in exchange for a small bedroom and 300 euros would literally be considered a crime but because it's in Europe it's an ‚ú®exchange program‚ú® like; I hate that I'm so far from my family for so long and I'm going through SO MUCH and it's physically hurting me. I've been feeling real back pain (so heavy that it paralyses my arm) daily; I hate that I'm the one having to feed and take care of 3 kids while the dumbest woman in the world (she can't open BOTTLES sometimes because she doesn't ""understand"") is busy having coffee with her girlfriends instead of taking care of children SHE decided to put into the world.
        
I hate that I hear so many bad things about other aupairs that are also getting paid as low as I am; I hate how this program is romanticized as such an amazing experience because honestly, is it? IS IT REALLY?; I hate how we're literally doing so much labor so ""rich"" people can go ‚ú®PLAY TENNIS‚ú® and they don't even have the decency to put their cups in the f# sink, or LOOK AT YOU when you come downstairs in the morning. I hate how they act like they're doing us a ""favor"" for taking us from our countries and bring us to ‚ú®wonderful Europe‚ú® as if being an aupair wasn't costly for us as well. I had a good life in my country, they're not saving me from anything!! 

I've been crying constantly, having panic attacks even around the kids, working extra hours on top of my extra hours and overall this ""hate"" I've been growing on me towards the parents' activities and parental decisions have been too much. I have noticed the shift in behavior because up until a month ago they were super nice to me and polite, and cleaning after themselves, and I used to feel seen and part of the house, but lately is absolutely awful ngl. 
  
I'm just really tired, been having bad nights of sleep and been really angry and because of my mental illness it's kind of hard to ""keep it inside"" so I just seem upset all the time. Also, I've been feeling angry towards the kids even if they're doing ""kids"" stuff which is making me feel shit. 

Yeah. I really don't understand why this program is seen as such an incredible thing when actually I think countries should shut it down entirely. 

I also understand that other people might have a good experience, or not be fed up by the program (like I am), or be a bit more healthy mentally so maybe I'm the exception, but yeah, I don't feel like it's a fair program with a fair payment or fair working conditions regardless of the ""good experiences"" other people might have.",3,1748713725.0,Aupairs,0,1.0,False

Nerve pain is like a roommate that never pays rent and won't shut up. It zaps, tingles, and burns its way into your day ‚Äî then has the audacity to interrupt your sleep.

It‚Äôs frustrating, exhausting, and way too common. The constant discomfort doesn‚Äôt just affect your body ‚Äî it messes with your mood, patience, and let‚Äôs be honest, your social life.

If you‚Äôve tried creams, gadgets, or stretching yourself into a pretzel with no relief, maybe it‚Äôs time to try something different. Let‚Äôs talk [VitaNerve6](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official).

# üì¶ Product Overview

**Product Name:** VitaNerve6  
**Category:** Supplements ‚ûù Nerve Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

This isn‚Äôt just one of those random **formulas that support nerve health** sitting next to the fish oil on the shelf. It was built with purpose.

**VitaNerve6** combines ingredients known to help with nerve damage and inflammation, bringing you a **supplement that relieves nerve pain** in a more targeted way.

You‚Äôre not getting flashy marketing or gimmicks ‚Äî just a clean blend that **naturally supports nerve function**.

# üß† What Is VitaNerve6 and Who Is It For?

This is a daily nerve health supplement made for people tired of constant tingling, burning, and that lovely sensation like ants crawling under your skin.

It's one of the **doctor-formulated supplements for nerve pain relief** that aims to improve nerve signals and help your body manage discomfort naturally.

This **supplement** may appeal to anyone dealing with **diabetic nerve pain, post-surgical issues**, or even just tired legs and persistent **tingling in the hands and feet**.

If you're considering **non-drug treatments for peripheral neuropathy**, this option lets you skip the pharmacy counter and still give your nerves a fighting chance.

# üåø Key Ingredients and How They Work

First up is **alpha-lipoic acid as a remedy for neuropathy**, a strong antioxidant shown to help improve nerve sensitivity and [reduce inflammation](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official) over time.

Then there‚Äôs **vitamin B12 for nerve recovery** ‚Äî critical for rebuilding the myelin sheath that protects nerves and keeps them working properly.

**Using turmeric to relieve nerve pain** isn't just trendy ‚Äî curcumin has a long-standing reputation for calming inflammation and easing discomfort.

You'll also get acetyl-L-carnitine and **natural anti-inflammatories that help with nerve pain**, like baicalin and ginkgo, which support blood flow and repair.

This combination makes it one of the **top supplements for regenerating nerves**. These ingredients do more than soothe ‚Äî they support healing deep down.

# ‚úã Erin‚Äôs Experience with VitaNerve6

So, my friend Erin ‚Äî a yoga teacher I met through a vegan cooking class last year ‚Äî was the one who convinced me to [try VitaNerve6](https://theworldhealth.org/vita-nerve-6-official).

She‚Äôs in her late 30s, super active, but she‚Äôd been quietly dealing with burning sensations in her feet after long teaching days.

She described it as this weird ‚Äúfizzing‚Äù feeling that would creep in by the evening and leave her tossing at night.

She‚Äôd already tried magnesium sprays, stretching routines, and even those funky foot massagers from Instagram. Nothing stuck.

Then she found this formula after Googling **natural solutions for neuropathy** and decided to give it a solid month.

By week two, she said the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù had mellowed to a low hum, and by week four, her post-class discomfort was down enough that she wasn‚Äôt dreading long holds or barefoot sequences anymore.

The real kicker?

She actually started sleeping through the night without having to stretch or ice her feet at 3 a.m.

Her only tiny complaint was the capsule size ‚Äî ‚Äúchunky, but doable,‚Äù in her words ‚Äî but she chased it with a protein smoothie and moved on with her day.

Hearing how much it helped her gave me the nudge I needed. I figured if a barefoot yogi teaching seven days a week could find relief, it was worth a try. And honestly, she wasn‚Äôt wrong.

1l031sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1l031sb/caffeine_sensitivity/,Caffeine sensitivity,"I'm on the waiting list for an ADHD RTC assessment currently. I seem to fit the criteria for inattentive, but one of the things that makes me feel like maybe I don't have it is the fact I'm really sensitive to caffeine.

I used to drink several cups of coffee a day in my twenties and it never stopped me sleeping, but as I got into my thirties I could gradually tolerate less and less caffeine. It spiked my anxiety and got to the point where a cup at 10am would stop me sleeping on an evening, so a few years ago, I cut it out and only drink decaf. Avoiding it controls my anxiety levels really well. I can manage an occasional Pepsi very early in the morning if I'm desperately tired, and I can tolerate small amounts in chocolate etc, but I just can't do caffeine in general.

The main treatment for ADHD is stimulants - is there anyone else sensitive to caffeine (I know most of you are insensitive to it or it makes you sleepy, so I don't need to know if that's the case)? I'm not sure if I'd manage with methylphenidate or similar, so it leaves me wondering if I'm diagnosed with it - will they be able to effectively medicate me?",2,1748713640.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1. Heed the warnings about the heat and humidity being different than in your city. OMG I was not prepared for being damp and hot all day and night.
2. Skip Commander‚Äôs Palace- service was shit and food was mediocre 
3. Go to Frenchmen‚Äôs Square at night for music, see Bourbon St once and then skip it the rest of the time
4. Try not to freak out about the cockroaches lol
5. Be amazed at how nice everyone is, like genuinely friendly. I‚Äôm from Seattle and was totally blown away 
6. Buy some rain ponchos from amazon before you go and don‚Äôt forget your sunscreen! Don‚Äôt be afraid to go out in the rain. It seemed all of the tourists disappeared once it started raining.
7. Don‚Äôt rent a car, if you are staying in the French Quartet. You can walk everywhere or grab an Uber. 
8. Plan to have the best time of your life and never want to leave. Spending a lot of your time thinking how great it would be to be able to drink your coffee in a beautiful courtyard or on a balcony.

I was able to grieve my hopes for our future, and not just that, the time without him constantly being in my head manipulating me, has opened my eyes to everything wrong with our relationship. 

He even showed up at my job one day as a ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù his job put him on the route but he never was at my job while I was there for over a year! I won‚Äôt lie, seeing him in person was eerie, I handled it immaculately, he saw me out and laughing with coworkers getting coffee. I looked good, he looked tired. This is probably because I‚Äôve been investing time to better myself- which he hated for me and honestly he never liked self care for himself either.

 I‚Äôm opening up with dating again. I just went out with a guy who aligns with me a lot better than my ex did. 

I used to have to beg and push my ex to do certain things that just come naturally to this guy & others in the past too.

It hurt at first because my ex totally manipulated, gaslighted me, lied and pretended and towards the end it was clear he just wanted to see me hurt or broken- but he didn‚Äôt win. When that didn‚Äôt work, he tried to give me gifts to manipulate me more after I told him to leave me alone. That‚Äôs when I stood strong in the no contact rule. 

It‚Äôs nice being open to dating again. It‚Äôs been refreshing to see that there are possibilities that are way greater than the lifeI thought I wanted with my ex who pretended he could build for us.

1l02yh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l02yh4/i_may_have_accidentally_gotten_the_attention_of_a/,I may have accidentally gotten the attention of a demon,"I should start off by saying that I‚Äôm no stranger to aspects of the occult. It doesn‚Äôt mean what most people think it does. When someone says the word ‚Äúoccult‚Äù the first thing that tends to pop into people‚Äôs head is folks clad in black robes standing around a pentagram, sacrificing goats and praying to the devil. That‚Äôs not my understanding of the occult. I simply see it as anything that deals with spirits or the energy surrounding them. That is what I was taught to see it as anyway, having grown up in a witchy household. I never dove into the darker corners of such practices. I‚Äôve mostly stuck to tarot readings, warding, a little bit of pendulum stuff and things like that. And though I‚Äôve grown up and adopted more modern practices, my interest in the occult never really faded which is why I still dip my toes into the proverbial pond from time to time.

Like many others in this day and age, one of the more modern interests I‚Äôve picked up is surfing the internet. Still having an interest in the occult my algorithm has incorporated such topics, leading me to playing videos on the subject to listen to as background noise as I go about my adult life. I recently started a series of videos about King Solomon, the kind of stuff that he supposedly got up to, and his codex. That inevitably led me to the contents of his codex; specifically Paimon, the 9th prince of hell.

I‚Äôve never had any interest in demons; if they even exist. I alway‚Äôs figured they were just dark entities best left on read and uninvited, but this one kind of intrigued me. Supposedly the 9th prince of hell, Paimon represents knowledge, the sciences, intellect and precision; everything that is the opposite of what I hate about myself. You see, I‚Äôve always been pretty dumb. Like special education dumb. Nothing has ever come easy to me and I‚Äôve always envied those who are quicker on the take than I, which is pretty much everyone. Apparently this demon prince is all about the opposite of what I am. What I wish I was. The entity also supposedly *chose* to descend in spite of its high status in the other direction. Why would such a being of such status *choose* to fall? I‚Äôve never wanted to ask the question so badly. Especially to one that may know the answer. That‚Äôs when I got to thinking‚Ä¶ if any of this is even real‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs what this entity is all about‚Ä¶ then what‚Äôs the harm in trying?

I admit I put a lot more effort into studying the matter of summoning Paimon than I should have before finally giving myself a dope smack. ‚ÄúNothing good could come of that‚Äù I thought to myself before proceeding with the unending slew of chores that is married life with two kids. It‚Äôs hard work, but it is fulfilling so I don‚Äôt mind. That is unless my chronic pain that has plagued my entire adult life decides to flair up, which it did that day for seemingly no reason. I had no medicine for the pain, but I did have alcohol. That did the trick well enough. The pain was staved off effectively enough to get everything and everyone situated for the evening. But as I did so something weird happened. The pain had gotten worse than it ever has, seemingly unprovoked, and no amount of ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù could quell it. In agony, but with everything and everyone taken care of, I laid down on the floor. And I passed out. But I remember thinking ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be nice to know what Paimon knows‚Äùright before I slipped into a deep sleep and dreamt many dreams. 

I‚Äôve had lucid dreams before, but I‚Äôve never had several in a row without first waking up. I dream‚Äôt of hanging out with friends around a coffee table; of Blue skies in grassy meadows; of walking down a pleasantly lit street on a starry night. Nothing out of the ordinary‚Ä¶ but these dreams were **vivid**. The smell of the coffee, the feel of the breeze, the ambient sounds, the light of the stars‚Ä¶ I sensed everything, and in astonishing detail. And I had full control. But every time I tried acting against the dream by making my own reality I would be swept off to the next one. This cycle repeated for what felt like hours, but the dreams were rather pleasant so I didn‚Äôt mind. That is until I wasn‚Äôt pleasantly swept off to the next one, but rather instantly blinked into a space that I could not fully comprehend. 

I found myself in an enclosed area and it was as if my senses had just instantly been switched off. There was no sound, no smell or taste; I couldn‚Äôt even feel the ground underneath my own feet. But I could see. I saw endless perfectly symmetrical shapes floating about the space, each one different in shape but polished and brilliantly reflecting light from an unseen source that emanated both everywhere and nowhere. It was brilliant, but stagnant. The entirety of the space filled me with an overpowering feeling of blankness that permeated even my most basic emotions. It felt like nothingness. Then my own voice spoke to me from some unseen source. 

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù it asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost 5‚Äù I softly droned in my numbness; my words echoing about the space. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to wake up.‚Äù

‚Äú**Not. Yet.**‚Äù Spoke my own voice again, this time in a devious tone.

I was still lucid. I was aware that I was dreaming and figured that I could hence wake myself up.  But I couldn‚Äôt. This dream was persistent. It would not allow me to alter its reality; it *was* reality, and it would not let me go. There was no escape. No exit. I felt as if I were gripped in the clutches of an unseen force. My mind began racing; telling itself anything and everything that might bring this borderline nightmare to an end. That‚Äôs when I was spoken to again, except this time the voice was not my own. It was like a very high-pitched, Monty Python-esque, little boys cockney accent paired equally and symmetrically with a vicious and low gutteral tremor of a sound that may have been a voice in and of itself, but would‚Äôve been incomprehensible were not paired with the other voice. I did not catch what it said at first given my frantic state, but then it demanded my attention. ‚ÄúMay you see and won‚Äôt you feel when the horse dies three days after when?‚Äù it both sang and growled.

My eyes opened. I was once again on the floor. I looked outside the window. The first thing I noticed was how different the telephone line looked through the security tinted window. How close it looks compared to the other half that was visible through plain screen. I found it fascinating. My back pain was‚Ä¶ gone. It was actually straight and I was not leaning anymore. I‚Äôve felt great ever since that night, but I have noticed some strange things ever since. Things like shadowy figures always dancing just on the outskirts of my sight, doors opening and closing on their own, and I seem to have developed a newfound fascination with shapes and lines. I can‚Äôt help but appreciate them, sometimes for longer than I probably should. And the question has lingered in my head‚Ä¶ when the horse dies three days after when‚Ä¶ I can hear it still in my head. And in the same voice.

But aside from that, I feel good. My pain is gone and I‚Äôve not felt so well in many years. I don‚Äôt know if it had anything to do with those dreams, or even why I had them. I have heard of some energy workers utilizing alcohol to ‚Äúthin‚Äù the veil during their rituals, but I myself have never attempted it. Not on purpose anyway. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if that‚Äôs exactly what I accidentally did. But feeling so well after that I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶ whether it‚Äôs real or not, if this feeling is what such a ritual has to offer, or if it‚Äôs merely coincidental, then what‚Äôs the harm in trying? I‚Äôve never wanted to ask the question so badly. Especially to one who may know the answer. Or so speaks the translucent shadow peering over my shoulder.",3,1748713413.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was in my third month of trying to conceive when I saw a message on my mate Esmond's phone from a contact named ""Hazel"".I frowned in thought, suddenlyÔºåstrong arms suddenly wrapped around my waist from behind.

The scent of damp pine needles and smoky oak flooded my senses‚ÄîEsmond's scent.His heated body pressed against mine as his teeth grazed my earlobe, sending sparks down my spine.Where do you want me tonight, sweetheart? By the window or on the couch?"" His voice rumbled against my skin, his breath hot.



Before I could answer, he scooped me up and dropped me onto the leather sofa, his shadow looming over me.



""Since you're being quiet, I'll pick the couch."" His amber eyes glowed with that primal hunger all wolves carried during the full moon.



""Will you finally mark me tonight?""



""Soon,"" he growled, trailing kisses down my throat. ""Like I promised‚Äîafter you're carrying our heir. My father's itching to meet Ironclaw's future alpha.""



His fingers slid toward the zipper of my dress.



""Wait‚Äîwe're in the packhouse,"" I protested, pushing weakly at his chest.



His thumb traced the faint crescent scar on my neck‚Äîthe temporary mark he left during our bonding ceremony.



""Meet me in our room. I'll wash off the patrol stench."" He kissed me once more before disappearing down the hall.



Lyra whimpered in my head, the hollow ache spreading through my ribs.



""He's holding back,"" she hissed. ""Why won't he claim us?""



""Maybe tonight, Lyra,"" I said.



I folded Esmond's discarded leather jacket.



A slip of paper fluttered to the floor. I¬†froze.



It was a business card. It read ""Hazel Berry.""



I flipped it over. Scrawled on the back, ""When the moon swells full, I can't control how badly my wolf wants you. The same way yours wants me.""



The faint tang of verbena hit my nose.



The card almost slipped from my trembling fingers.



I took a deep breath, trying to calm down.



The door slammed open.



Esmond stood framed in moonlight, water glistening on his sculpted torso. His eyes burned with restless energy.



""Babe, emergency at the company. Gotta handle it."" He pulled me into a quick hug, his touch colder than usual.



It felt like a knife had stabbed my heart. Disappointment and sadness washed over me like a tidal wave.



""Can't it wait? It's the full moon‚Äî""



""Wish it could. Be back soon."" His kiss grazed my forehead before he vanished.



The moment his footsteps faded, the temporary mark ignited.



Burning pain shot through my veins, scorching my throat and nearly suffocating me.



Suddenly, my chest started to ache. The pain was drilling into my bones, making it hard to breathe.



Then the visions hit‚Äîa tangled bedsheet, Esmond's hands buried in golden hair.



""He's with her!"" Lyra howled. ""Our mate betrayed us!""



The pain faded, leaving me slumped in the corner of my bedroom. My clothes stuck to me like second skin, drenched in cold sweat.



I was the Alpha's daughter of Shadowfang Pack.



My arranged marriage to Esmond from Ironclaw Pack had been strictly political - two powerful werewolf packs merging through their heirs.



As the Alpha's daughter, my marriage was a tool to strengthen our pack.



We weren't supposed to feel anything. But after the mating ceremony's temporary mark... something shifted.



The bond made me care. And now this?



I couldn't believe he would betray me.



The dam holding back my emotions burst, and anger made my body¬†boil.



""Let me out,"" Lyra growled in my mind.



I loosened my grip on my consciousness. A surge of power coursed through me.



My bones cracked as fur erupted across my skin, and my claws and teeth sharpened.



I endured the pain. With a series of crisp bone movements, I fully shifted.



I shook my body, then I leaped from the bedroom windowsill with a powerful push from my hind legs.



I sprinted toward the Shadow Forest on the border of the Ironclaw Pack's territory.



Thirty minutes later, exhausted, I transformed back into my human form.



I walked into a bar, ordered two drinks, said nothing, and downed them both.



The liquor burned my throat first, then my stomach.



I never drank. I had no idea how to face my dad.



Soon, I polished off two bottles of whiskey. My vision started to blur.



Next thing I knew, I woke up in some hotel bed that smelled like cheap air freshener.



My phone buzzed.



My friend Eugenia's texts lit up the screen.



\[Hey babe, you were trashed so I got you a room.\]



\[BTW ordered you some dessert ;) Room 520. Six-pack abs, golden retriever energy. Go wild.\]



I put my phone down. I looked at myself in the mirror.



My long, curly brown hair fell over my shoulders, my skin was pale, and my lips were red. I glanced down at the red dress clinging to my body, stood up, and swayed a little.



Normally, I'd nope out.



But whiskey courage had me replying back.



I stumbled down the hallway and found the door of 520 stood ajar.



Curious about what he looked like, I pushed the door open wider and peeked in.



The room was dark. Moonlight outlined a broad-shouldered silhouette against the windows.



I could just make out a tall figure. He was a foot taller than me, with a muscular build.



I smiled. My fingers traced rock-hard abs under his unbuttoned shirt.



He smelled like cedar and trouble.



""Earn your paycheck, pretty boy,"" I slurred, pushing him backward.

Cedarwood and iron tang hit my nostrils.



I sniffed deeper, craving more of his scent.



Then it hit me ‚Äì that aggressive, intoxicating musk only a prime Alpha could emit.



The rock-hard muscles under my fingertips tensed.



A calloused hand clamped around my wrist, yanking me away from the warmth I desperately wanted to explore.



Moonlight caught the glint of his eyes as he spread my arms, scanning me head to toe.



His gaze lingered on my curves.



""Wrong room?""



I sidestepped and tripped him with my leg, sending him sprawling onto the floor.



I gasped and covered my mouth. ""S-sorry! Didn't mean to‚Äî""



My words slurred. I blinked a few times.



I was drunk.



Propped on one elbow, he laughed.



""Most entertaining crash landing I've ever seen."" His palm slid up my thigh.



My neck gland throbbed. Lyra howled in my skull ‚Äì it was the signal of a true mate.



But this silhouette was human. Moonlight haloed his disheveled head.



What was the truth?



My true mate was some random human call boy?



Lyra growled, pushing my trembling fingers to yank down my lace strap.



Since the temporary marking, Esmond never made me burn like this.



The full moon turned my wolf's hunger into molten need.



His golden eyes narrowed to slits as my bra clasp snapped ‚Äì predator's gaze. Those were not human eyes.



Then it hit me ‚Äì the pleasant cedar scent might not be from body wash.



""Wait‚Äî"" My protest drowned in his pine storm.



When he pinned me against the wall, Alpha dominance crushed my lungs.



Lyra howled approval. My knees hit granite thighs as his rough palm slid under my red minidress.



The roughness of his palm made my heart skip a beat, my pulse racing wildly.



Lyra was just beneath the surface, urging me to act, to feel everything.



""You're shaking,"" he purred against my ear, fangs grazing skin.



The temporary bond mark flared white-hot.



I tried to push him away, but he easily sensed my movement and pinned my hands above my head.



""Let... go...""



His laugh vibrated through me. ""Cut the act, gorgeous.""



Moonlight revealed emerald wolf eyes.



Lyra went feral ‚Äì full moon madness.



""Mark me!"" I clawed his back.



He tossed me onto the mattress.



The mattress was soft. I didn't feel any pain, but the fall made my head even dizzier.



A tall figure loomed over me.



If Esmond could cheat, why couldn't I claim my true mate?



His fingers closed around my throat, forcing my gaze up.



Moonlight showed our tangled reflection ‚Äì my scarlet dress around his hips, his golden strands smeared with my lipstick.



Then I saw his face.



""Lionel."" The name tore from me.



He was MY MATE's uncle.



Lionel's POV



When that woman called out my name, my muddled consciousness snapped into clarity.



I pushed my wolf, Leroy, back into the recesses of my mind.



I flew back to LA for the Ironclaw Pack Gathering hosted by my father, Alpha Drogo.



But here's the kicker‚ÄîI didn't tell a soul from the pack about my whereabouts.



Only my Beta knew I was holed up in this overpriced hotel suite.



So, I immediately turned on the desk lamp.



The sudden light made me squint. When my vision cleared, I looked at the woman lying in bed.



She had long brown hair, and her eyes were filled with panic.



When I looked at her neck, I saw a faint, incomplete mark.



The sight hit me like a punch in the gut‚ÄîI immediately realized the gravity of the situation.



I looked at her face again.



By then, she also saw me clearly. Her already pale face turned even whiter. It was obvious that the alcohol had worn off.



""... Uncle Lionel?""



Hearing her address me, I remembered something. A few years ago, I attended Aljean's son's wedding when I was back at Ironclaw Pack. Aljean was my brother. He was older than me.



The she-wolf who had made a mate vow with Esmond was the woman in front of me.



Her name was Camellia, a she-wolf with Alpha blood.



""Uncle Lionel... I..."" She opened her mouth, nervously trying to say something.



""Shut up."" I snapped.



My mood was terrible, filled with anger and disappointment. I couldn't believe this had happened.



She seemed scared. She wanted to explain, but I didn't want to hear it.



Leroy protested in my mind. He still wanted her.



I looked at Camellia's face. When my gaze fell on the skin of her chest, Leroy roared again.



""Get. Out."" The words came out harsher than I intended.



As I stood up, Camellia's eyes glanced at my body.



She froze for a moment, then awkwardly looked away. Her ears were turning red.



She had no idea how attractive that reaction was to me.



""Get out of here! I don't want to see you again!"" I shouted, my voice filled with anger.



Camellia scrambled for her dress, that floral scent still messing with my head.



After she fled, I chain-smoked by the ruined bed, dialing my cleanup crew.



""Scrub all security footage. Tonight never happened.""



Leroy kept whining about lost chances while I stared at the city lights.



My nephew's wife. My mate. The universe really needed to lay off the tequila shots.



**Chapter 3**



Camellia's POV



I stumbled out of the hotel in a daze. My head was spinning as I tried to make sense of everything.



Pulling out my phone, I drafted a text to Lionel.



""Hey, it's Camellia. Let's just pretend last night never happened? I was totally wasted.""



But when I hit send, the message bounced back with that awful red exclamation mark. Blocked.



Great. I shoved my phone in my pocket, weirdly relieved.



At least he wanted to forget this too.



I was just about to put away my phone when I suddenly received a text message. 



It was a photo, and in it, my mate was sleeping in the arms of another woman.



My phone case cracked under my grip.



Compared to last night's pain, this hurt wasn't enough to break me.



The mate bond between us felt like frayed rope about to snap.



I carefully made my way back to the room I shared with Esmond.



As soon as I pushed open the door, I saw him sitting on the couch.



Esmond whirled around. His bloodshot eyes were locking onto me.



""Where were you last night? I tried mind-linking you and got static! You weren't in the pack!""



Esmond stood up and walked quickly toward me, reaching for my hand, but I dodged.



I smelled verbena on him.



""Since when do you care where I am during full moon?"" The scent of verbena clinging to his shirt making me nauseous.



Esmond stepped closer, trying to take my hand again, but I dodged once more.



""Don't touch me!"" I said.



He froze mid-reach. ""Cam, come on. It was just pack business, you know how it is-""



I didn't say anything. I just stared at him coldly.



My hand tightened around my phone, which felt like it was burning from the photo.



Esmond's eyes flickered. His hand clenched at his side.



""You found it out, don't you?""



His voice was calm, without any hint of panic, as if he had expected this day to come.



I glared at his unflinching pupils. Lyra grew furious inside me. My canines pierced my gums and extended.



He stepped closer.



""Don't touch me with a mouth that reeks of another b\*tch's scent,"" I said through gritted teeth, eyeing the half-healed mark on his collarbone. ""You could've asked for a rejection...""



The Alpha's oppressive aura surged. His fingers turned into steel-like claws, gripping the back of my neck. ""It was one mistake during her heat cycle. My wolf went feral, okay? It was just a mistaken mark...""



""Oh really?"" I ripped my collar open. ""Guess I'll go let the grey wolf from Red Rock Pack 'accidentally' mark me too then?""



The room temperature dropped. Esmond's golden eyes glowed. ""Try it. I'll rip out his throat and yours.""



The ice in his voice finally broke me. My heart turned to ice under his cold, emotionless gaze.



So he knew betrayal was unforgivable, yet he still did it.



""Remember what I said when you proposed?"" My voice shook. ""One betrayal and I'm gone.""



I wiped away a tear from the corner of my eye, my tone mocking and tinged with hatred. ""I won't share a mate with any werewolf.""



""Cam, just give me another chance. She's just my secretary. I'll fire her today and transfer her pack, whatever you want,"" Esmond said.



""Too late. Do you really think that can make up for your cheating? Cheating is unforgivable, among werewolves and humans alike,"" I replied.



Esmond's face darkened even more. ""We're mates. That bond doesn't break unless I say so.""



""No matter what you say, I've already made up my mind. I'll go tell Alpha Drogo and Luna Chelsea and ask for a mutual rejection,"" I said.



Esmond tried to step closer. ""Cam, don't do this. You need me, and I need you too.""



Lyra growled inside me. She hated Esmond.



""Stay away from me!"" I said.



I turned to leave the bedroom.



Esmond grabbed my wrist. ""You always wanted a kid,"" his voice rasped. ""Let's make one right now. What do you say?""



""That was before."" I yanked my arm free. ""I'll have children someday‚Äîjust not yours.""



His amber eyes flashed.



Every Alpha-blooded werewolf had that possessive streak.



Before I could blink, he slammed me onto the mattress, his weight pinning me down.



""Say that again."" His growl vibrated against my collarbone.



I bared my teeth. ""I'd rather die than carry your spawn. You make me sick.""



His mouth crashed into mine before I finished.



Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.



His thumb brushed my bare collarbone. Instead of the usual electric shiver down my spine, nausea churned through my gut.



""Don't look at me like that,"" he murmured, lips grazing my earlobe. ""You know how hungry my wolf gets after the full moon.""



Lyra's screech nearly split my skull.



My right hand shifted involuntarily, claws ripping through his left shoulder.



""F\*ck!"" Esmond staggered back, smashing into the coffee table. The crystal ashtray shattered.



Blood dripped onto the beige rug as he clutched his shoulder.



His golden irises trembled violently. He stared at my still-shifted hand as if seeing a stranger.



""This... can't be...""

I‚Äôm a 24-year-old Black man who grew up on the east side of Pittsburgh‚ÄîMorningside, Garfield, East Liberty, Larimer, Homewood. My family has been here for generations. My grandmother was a teacher. My dad was a musician in the city. My uncle is an educator at one of the charter schools. My granduncle drove a bus in the '80s and '90s. This city runs through my blood. I didn‚Äôt move here for college. I didn‚Äôt come for a job opportunity. I was born here, raised here, and I‚Äôve seen every version of this city shift and mutate in ways people who haven‚Äôt lived here long can‚Äôt begin to understand.

When people talk about ‚ÄúPittsburghers,‚Äù the perception is almost always filtered through the lens of transplants. People from New York, Philly, D.C., and other predominantly white cities move here and suddenly feel qualified to speak on what Pittsburgh is and isn‚Äôt. But they don‚Äôt know this city. They‚Äôve never *been* of this city.

This paper exists to clear up the misconceptions. To push back against the monolithic image of Pittsburgh. To shed light on the political gaslighting, polite racism, and structural erasure that exists just beneath the surface.

# Polite Racism & Zionism in Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh has a serious problem with Zionism‚Äîparticularly in its social and political behavior. It‚Äôs not just about politics in the abstract. It‚Äôs the *temperament* of the Zionist community here: reactive, elitist, passive-aggressive, and deeply invested in performative progressivism. It mirrors the metastasized conservatism of central Pennsylvania, wrapped up in polite liberal packaging. You‚Äôll rarely encounter overt racism, but you‚Äôll see it in the zoning restrictions, permit denials, code violations. It‚Äôs bureaucratic racism‚Äîweaponized policy masquerading as neutrality.

This is a city where being quietly racist is an art form, perfected over decades. Where institutions and affluent individuals claim to support equity but work diligently behind the scenes to push Black families out of generational homes for development deals and dog parks.

# The Transplant Effect

Transplants don‚Äôt understand the deeply embedded racism in Pittsburgh because they‚Äôve never had to. Most of the people moving here are white and come from privilege. They bring their lifestyles with them‚Äîwine tastings, $25 entry clubs, and events priced to exclude. The entire city shifts to accommodate their tastes. Neighborhoods that once had corner stores and barbershops now have coffee shops and concept art galleries. And these transplants, with their privilege, have no idea they‚Äôre helping displace the very people who *made* Pittsburgh what it is.

Most transplants can afford a car or a bike and call this city ‚Äúwalkable.‚Äù But the average Black Pittsburgher? We take the bus. We walk. We work long hours and don‚Äôt have time or money for the boutique experiences that dominate local Instagram feeds. Our friends aren‚Äôt on Reddit. We‚Äôre not in the indie circles or artsy side quests of Pittsburgh. We live paycheck to paycheck. We keep to ourselves because trust is scarce in a city where fake smiles often mask real hostility.

# The Two Pittsburghs

There are two Pittsburghs. The one tourists and transplants see, and the one we live in. The former gets covered in glossy magazines, labeled ‚ÄúMost Livable City,‚Äù while the latter is where being Black with a criminal record can mean permanent social and economic exile. And when people from the ‚Äúlivable‚Äù Pittsburgh see you struggling, they wonder why you can‚Äôt ‚Äújust work harder,‚Äù never realizing that they‚Äôre operating from an entirely different starting line.

Pittsburgh is not walkable. Pittsburgh is not livable‚Äînot if you‚Äôre Black, not if you‚Äôre poor, not if you‚Äôve got a record, or even if you‚Äôve just got bills and no safety net. Transplants can‚Äôt see that because they‚Äôre insulated by the lifestyle their privilege affords them. They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to live here with no car, no family safety net, no job that pays beyond survival.

# The Social Divide

Most of the big events, clubs, festivals, and popular social scenes here are filled with people who aren‚Äôt even from the city. Regular Pittsburghers, especially Black ones, aren‚Äôt shelling out $30 to sip wine or hit a themed dance party. We grew up watching people be displaced. We grew up watching our neighborhoods get turned into case studies for economic development. And that instills caution. It instills a lack of trust.

So we don‚Äôt go to your events. We don‚Äôt show up in your Reddit threads. And it‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre antisocial or lazy. It‚Äôs because we‚Äôve seen what happens when you trust the wrong people here.

# Final Thoughts

This isn‚Äôt an attack. It‚Äôs a truth-telling. Pittsburgh is not what it seems. It‚Äôs a city full of contradictions, and unless you‚Äôve *lived* here, you‚Äôll never fully grasp the weight of that. The Pittsburgh subreddit, the city tourism campaigns, the glossy ‚Äúinnovation district‚Äù buzzwords‚Äînone of it reflects the real Pittsburgh.

This city has failed its Black residents over and over again. And the influx of new people, without any historical context or willingness to learn, is just another chapter in a long story of displacement and quiet, policy-driven violence. If you care about Pittsburgh, you need to learn its full story‚Äînot just the one curated for you.

Pittsburgh is not ‚Äúthe most livable city.‚Äù It‚Äôs just one where people like *you* can live comfortably‚Äîbecause people like *me* were pushed to the margins to make room.

1l02u9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l02u9q/silver_hair/,Silver Hair,"It had been a long day, the kind that drags on until you‚Äôre running on coffee and sheer stubbornness. I‚Äôm Skyler, a sophomore at Westbridge Community College, majoring in psychology. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how people tick, though lately, I‚Äôve been too buried in textbooks to figure out my own head. Between classes, a part-time job at the campus bookstore, and trying to keep up with assignments, my days blur together. I‚Äôm the first in my family to go to college, and the pressure to make it work is always there, like a weight on my shoulders. My mom calls every Sunday to remind me how proud she is, but also how much she‚Äôs counting on me to ‚Äúmake something‚Äù of myself. No pressure, right?

This morning started like any other. I hit snooze on my alarm three times, threw on my favorite hoodie, and grabbed a granola bar on my way out of the tiny apartment I share with a roommate who‚Äôs never around. Class was a slog. Professor Hargrove droned on about cognitive biases while I doodled in my notebook, trying not to fall asleep. Afterwards, I worked a four-hour shift at the bookstore, restocking shelves and dodging questions from freshmen who couldn‚Äôt find their textbooks. By the time I got to the library to cram for my psych exam, the sun was already dipping below the horizon. I didn‚Äôt mean to stay so late, but I got lost in my notes, headphones in, listening to one of those horror story narrations on YouTube. I‚Äôve always loved creepy stories, creepypastas, urban legends, anything that gives you that shiver down your spine. They‚Äôre my guilty pleasure, a way to escape the grind. However, they also make me jumpy, especially when I‚Äôm alone at night.

As I left the library past midnight, my stomach knotted with that familiar unease. The fog clung to the campus like a shroud, thick and damp, swallowing the streetlights‚Äô feeble glow. My footsteps echoed on the empty sidewalk, each one a little too loud in the suffocating silence. I pulled my hoodie tighter, my breath puffing out in shallow clouds, my fingers tingling with nervous energy. The mist made everything feel wrong, like I‚Äôd stepped into one of those horror narrations. My heart gave a little lurch, and I laughed to myself, a shaky sound. ‚ÄúGet a grip, Skyler,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in a creepypasta.‚Äù The words felt hollow, like I was trying to convince myself more than I believed it.

The fog pressed closer, curling around the edges of my vision, turning distant shapes into vague, looming threats. By the time I reached the bus stop, my skin was prickling, my chest tight with a growing sense of dread. The lone streetlamp cast a sickly yellow pool of light, barely holding back the darkness. The streets were dead, no cars, no voices, just me and the mist. I stood under the lamp, checking my phone, my fingers clumsy with nerves. The bus was supposed to come in ten minutes. Ten minutes felt like an eternity when every shadow seemed to move.

I shifted my weight, my backpack heavy with textbooks, the straps digging into my shoulders. The longer I stood there, the more exposed I felt, like a deer caught in a hunter‚Äôs sights. My mind started to spiral, every rustle of leaves, every faint creak of a branch made my heart skip. I could feel my pulse in my throat, fast and unsteady. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being paranoid,‚Äù I told myself, shaking my head, trying to shake off the creeping panic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a quiet night.‚Äù But then I heard it.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

The sound came from somewhere down the street, hidden in the fog to my left. It was sharp, deliberate, like metal tapping against pavement. My breath caught, and a cold sweat broke out on my palms. I turned, squinting into the haze, my eyes straining to see something, anything. Nothing. Just endless gray. The clinking grew louder, closer, each tap sending a jolt through my chest, like a hammer striking my ribs. It wasn‚Äôt rushed, not frantic, just steady, inevitable, like whatever was making it knew I couldn‚Äôt escape. My pulse roared in my ears, and I clutched my phone tighter, my fingers trembling so badly I nearly dropped it. I willed the bus to appear, my breath hitching as I fought the urge to run.

Then, just as suddenly, the sound stopped. The silence was worse. It pressed down on me, heavy and suffocating, like the world was holding its breath. My chest tightened, my lungs struggling to pull in air. I scanned the street, my eyes darting from shadow to shadow, my heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst. Nothing. No one. I forced a laugh, the sound brittle and false in the quiet. ‚ÄúGreat, Skyler, now you‚Äôre hearing things,‚Äù I whispered, but my voice shook, betraying the fear clawing at my insides. I turned back to the bus stop sign, trying to focus on the schedule, but my hands wouldn‚Äôt stop trembling.

‚ÄúHello, there.‚Äù

The voice came from my right, smooth and cool, like a blade sliding across silk. My heart lurched into my throat, and I spun around, nearly dropping my phone. A gasp tore from my lips, my body flooding with adrenaline. There he was, standing just outside the circle of light, a tall man, too tall, his silhouette sharp against the fog. He wore a long, dark purple coat that looked like it belonged in a gothic novel, the kind of thing you‚Äôd see in a costume shop but never in real life. A matching fedora sat low on his head, shadowing his face, but his eyes caught the light. They were bright blue, almost glowing, piercing through the haze. His hair was long, silver, and cascading down to the middle of his back, shimmering like moonlight on water.

I couldn‚Äôt speak. My chest heaved, breath escaping in short, panicked bursts, my mind screaming ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù as my feet remained rooted to the ground. My hands shook so badly I stuffed them into my pockets, trying to hide my fear. He chuckled, a low, velvet sound that sent a shiver down my spine, like cold fingers brushing my skin.

‚ÄúMy apologies,‚Äù he said, his voice deep and graceful, each word carefully measured, like he was savoring them. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to startle you.‚Äù He tilted his head slightly, studying me with those unnerving eyes, and I felt like a mouse under a cat‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúDo you know when the next bus arrives?‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my tongue sticking to the roof of my mouth. ‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôm not sure. Should be a few minutes.‚Äù My voice was small, shaky, barely audible over the pounding of my heart. Where had he come from? The street was empty a second ago, and I hadn‚Äôt heard footsteps. Just that clinking. My stomach twisted, a sick feeling settling in my gut.

He smiled, a slow, charming curve of his lips that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He extended a gloved hand, his other arm tucked behind his back like some old-fashioned gentleman. ‚ÄúMay I have your name?‚Äù

My instincts screamed, ‚Äú*don‚Äôt* ‚Äù a primal warning that made my skin crawl. But his gaze held me, those blue eyes pinning me in place, like they were pulling the words out of me. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude, but it was more than that, like I *had* to answer, like my will wasn‚Äôt entirely my own. ‚ÄúSkyler,‚Äù I said, barely above a whisper. I reached out, my hand trembling, and his gloved fingers closed around mine, cool even through the leather, sending a chill up my arm.

‚ÄúA lovely name,‚Äù he said, his smile widening just enough to show a hint of teeth. He didn‚Äôt offer his own name, just released my hand and straightened, bringing his other arm forward. That‚Äôs when I saw it, a cane, simple and black with a silver orb at the top, glinting in the lamplight. My mind flashed to the clinking sound, and my heart skipped a beat. Was that him? No, that sound had come from the *other* side of the street. Hadn‚Äôt it? My thoughts spun, my head foggy with confusion and fear.

Before I could process it, he spoke again. ‚ÄúAre you alone, Miss Skyler?‚Äù His tone was polite, almost concerned, but there was something underneath it, something dark and hungry that made my stomach lurch.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, then quickly added, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm meeting someone.‚Äù A lie, blurted out in a panic, my voice cracking. I didn‚Äôt want him to know I was heading home alone, that I was vulnerable. ‚ÄúJust, you know, waiting for the bus.‚Äù

He nodded, his eyes never leaving mine, boring into me like he could see every thought in my head. ‚ÄúA beautiful woman like yourself shouldn‚Äôt be out alone so late. Dangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.‚Äù

I forced a laugh, the sound choking in my throat, high and nervous. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be careful,‚Äù I managed, but my voice trembled, and I could feel my hands shaking in my pockets. His words echoed in my mind, not a warning but a promise, like he knew something I didn‚Äôt.

Headlights pierced the fog, and relief flooded through me, loosening the knot in my chest for a moment. The bus screeched to a stop, and I practically leapt onto the steps, my legs shaky with adrenaline. I glanced back, half-expecting him to follow, and there he was, climbing aboard behind me, his cane tapping the steps, *clink, clink*. My stomach dropped, the brief relief replaced by a fresh wave of panic. The bus was empty, not a single passenger, just rows of worn seats under flickering fluorescent lights. The air inside felt stale, heavy, like it was pressing against my lungs. I hurried to a seat in the middle, gripping my backpack like a lifeline, my fingers digging into the straps until they ached. I heard him move down the aisle, his steps slow, deliberate, each one sending a shiver through me. I kept my eyes forward, praying he‚Äôd sit somewhere else. Anywhere else.

He didn‚Äôt. He passed me, his coat brushing the air, the faint scent of something metallic and old lingering in his wake. He took a seat at the very back of the bus, the worst possible place. I could feel his eyes on me, a weight that pressed against the back of my neck, heavy and unrelenting. My skin prickled, every nerve screaming that I was being watched. My breath came in short, shallow gasps, and I tried to focus on the hum of the bus, the squeak of the seats, anything to drown out the feeling. It was no use. I could *feel* him staring, his gaze like a cold finger trailing down my spine, making my heart race faster.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. My body moved before my brain caught up, and I turned, just a quick glance over my shoulder. He was there, leaning back in his seat, his head tilted slightly, those blue eyes locked on me. His lips curved into a small, knowing smirk, like he‚Äôd caught me in some game. My heart lurched, a sick lurch of fear, and I snapped my head forward, my breath coming in sharp, panicked bursts. *Just make it to your stop, Skyler. Just make it home.* The words repeated in my head like a mantra, but they did little to calm the terror clawing at my chest.

The bus crawled through the fog, stopping every few blocks. Each time the doors hissed open, I prayed he‚Äôd get off, my fingers crossed so tightly they hurt. He didn‚Äôt. My stop was coming up, and the closer it got, the faster my heart pounded, a frantic rhythm that made my head spin. I gripped the edge of my seat, my knuckles white, my palms sweaty. When the bus finally slowed at my stop, I bolted up, practically running to the door, my legs trembling so badly I nearly tripped. I didn‚Äôt look back, not until I was almost off.

‚ÄúYou have a safe night, Miss Skyler,‚Äù his voice called, smooth and mocking, cutting through the hum of the bus like a knife. I froze, one foot on the pavement, my heart slamming against my ribs. I glanced back, unable to stop myself. He was still in his seat, smiling that same charming, predatory smile, his eyes glinting in the dim light, unblinking. I gave a weak wave, my hand trembling, and stumbled off the bus, my legs barely holding me up.

As it pulled away, I caught one last glimpse of him through the window, his face pale against the glass, still watching me. Those blue eyes seemed to burn into me, even through the fog, and I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold. Then the bus vanished into the mist, and I was alone again. I let out a shaky breath, my legs weak, my body trembling from the adrenaline crash. The street was darker than I remembered, the streetlights barely cutting through the mist. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the sound of my sneakers scuffing the pavement as I started toward home.

The relief didn‚Äôt last. The air felt heavier now, the fog thicker, like it was pressing against my skin, clinging to me like damp cloth. Every few steps, I glanced over my shoulder, my heart still racing, half-expecting to see him standing there, his silver hair glowing in the dark. My mind replayed his words: *Dangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.* Was he warning me, or threatening me? The question gnawed at me, feeding the panic that refused to let go. I shook my head, trying to push the thought away, my breath hitching. He was gone. He stayed on the bus. I was fine. I had to be fine.

Then I heard it, a laugh, soft and faint, carried on the wind. It wasn‚Äôt warm or friendly. It was low, guttural, like the growl of an animal circling its prey. My heart stuttered, and I walked faster, my backpack bouncing against my spine, the straps digging into my shoulders. Shadows flickered in the corners of my vision, but when I turned, there was nothing, just empty streets and swirling fog. My breath came in ragged bursts, my chest tight with panic, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold onto my bag. I was only a few blocks from home, but it felt like miles, each step heavier than the last.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

The sound stopped me cold. It was the same metallic tap, sharp and deliberate, coming from behind me. My blood turned to ice, my body frozen in place. I spun around, my eyes wide, but the street was empty. The fog swallowed everything beyond a few feet. My pulse roared in my ears, so loud I could barely think, and I backed up, clutching my backpack straps, my fingers numb. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called, my voice trembling, breaking on the last word. No answer. Just silence, thick and suffocating, pressing down on me until I could hardly breathe.

I turned and ran, my sneakers pounding the pavement, the sound echoing in the quiet. The clinking followed, never speeding up, never slowing down, always just behind me, like a shadow I couldn‚Äôt shake. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, but I didn‚Äôt dare stop. My apartment was so close, just across the park.

*The park*, I thought.

My stomach twisted, a fresh wave of dread washing over me. I hated that park at night. It was a black void, barely lit, the trees looming like skeletal hands reaching out of the fog. However, going around would take an hour, and with that sound behind me, I didn‚Äôt have a choice.

I hesitated at the park‚Äôs entrance, my breath hitching, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The clinking had stopped again, but the silence was worse, like the calm before a predator strikes. I peered into the darkness, the faint glow of a single lamppost flickering in the distance, barely visible through the fog. My hands shook as I gripped my backpack, my books digging into my chest, my fingers aching from the pressure. I could turn back, take the long way, but the thought of that clinking sound starting again pushed me forward. I stepped into the park, my heart in my throat, my body trembling with every step.

The darkness swallowed me. The fog was thicker here, curling around the trees like ghostly fingers, brushing against my skin. Every rustle, every snap of a twig made my heart leap into my throat, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. I moved as fast as I could, my eyes locked on the lamppost‚Äôs faint light, my only guide in the suffocating dark. Something moved to my right, a shadow, quick and fleeting. I gasped, stumbling back, my books nearly slipping from my arms, my heart racing so fast I thought I might pass out. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible, trembling with fear. Nothing. Just the pounding of my own heart, loud and relentless.

*Clink. Clink. Clink.*

It was louder now, right behind me, each tap like a nail in my coffin. I didn‚Äôt look back. I couldn‚Äôt. I broke into a jog, my legs burning, my chest screaming, my vision blurring with tears of panic. The lamppost was closer, its light a beacon in the dark. I just had to make it there. Just a little farther.

Laughter. Not the sinister chuckle from before, but bright, almost cheerful, like a group of friends sharing a joke. I rounded a bend in the path and saw them, three men standing under the lamppost, their silhouettes sharp against the glow. Relief crashed over me like a wave, loosening the knot in my chest for the first time all night. I recognized them from campus, guys a year ahead of me. I didn‚Äôt know their names, but I‚Äôd seen them in classes, laughing in the halls. Normal. Safe. My legs nearly gave out with gratitude.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I called, my voice cracking as I ran toward them, my breath ragged. They turned, startled, their faces lit by the lamplight. The tallest one, a blond guy with a friendly smile, stepped forward.

‚ÄúHey, are you okay?‚Äù he asked, his brow furrowing, his voice calm but concerned.

I nodded, gasping for breath, my hands still shaking as I clutched my backpack. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs following me,‚Äù I said, glancing over my shoulder, my heart still racing. The path was empty, but the hairs on my neck stood on end, my skin crawling with the memory of that clinking sound. ‚ÄúI heard‚Ä¶ something. A cane, I think. I don‚Äôt know, but I feel that someone is following me!‚Äù

The three exchanged looks, their expressions unreadable. The shorter one, with long black hair, frowned. ‚ÄúYou sure? We didn‚Äôt see anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure,‚Äù I insisted, my voice shaking, my chest tight with lingering fear. The third guy, darker-skinned with a serious expression, stepped past me, peering into the fog.

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs out there,‚Äù he said, but his tone wasn‚Äôt reassuring, and a flicker of unease stirred in my gut. The blond guy smiled again, warmer this time, and I clung to it like a lifeline.

‚ÄúHey, we know each other, don‚Äôt we? From psych class?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jake. This is Matt,‚Äù he nodded to the black-haired guy, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs Chris.‚Äù The darker-skinned guy gave a small nod. ‚ÄúWant us to walk you home? Just to be safe?‚Äù

I almost cried with relief, my shoulders sagging as the tension drained out of me. ‚ÄúYes, please. Thank you,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling with gratitude.

We started walking, the three of them forming a loose circle around me. Their presence was like a shield, pushing back the fear that had been clawing at me. Jake chatted lightly, asking about classes, making small talk, his voice soothing. I tried to focus, but my nerves were still raw, my eyes darting to the shadows, my heart still pounding faintly. The park seemed endless, the fog thicker with every step, but I felt safer, like I could finally breathe again.

Then it happened. A hand clamped over my mouth, rough and sudden, cutting off my scream. My heart stopped, my body flooding with icy terror. Two more pairs of hands grabbed my arms, yanking me off the path into the trees. I thrashed and kicked, my screams muffled against the hand, my body trembling with panic. They were too strong, dragging me deeper into the dark, my backpack falling, my books scattering across the ground. My mind screamed, *No, no, no*, as the reality of what was happening sank in.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Jake hissed, his voice no longer friendly but cold, predatory, sending a fresh wave of terror through me. They pulled me into a clearing, far from the path, where the fog was so thick I could barely see. Jake‚Äôs hand stayed over my mouth, his fingers digging into my skin, bruising. Matt pinned my arms above my head, his grip like iron, while Chris held my legs, his hands rough and unyielding. I tried to scream again, but it was useless, the sound trapped in my throat. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst, tears streaming down my face as I realized what was coming. Jake leaned close, his breath hot and sour against my ear.¬†

‚ÄúBe a good girl and keep quiet,‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúif you know what‚Äôs good for you.‚Äù His voice was a blade, sharp and cruel, cutting through my hope. I fought harder, my body straining against their hold, my muscles burning, but it was no use. Jake shoved a rag into my mouth, the taste bitter and chemical, making me gag. He started undoing my jeans, his fingers rough, his eyes gleaming with something sickening, something that made my stomach churn with revulsion.¬†

‚ÄúI hope you enjoy this as much as we will,‚Äù he said, his grin twisted and cruel, his eyes glinting with a predatory hunger.

My mind was a whirlwind of terror and despair, my body trembling uncontrollably. I was trapped, helpless, my tears soaking the rag as I braced for the worst. Then, a blur of movement. Jake was ripped off me, thrown into the trees with a sickening crunch that echoed in the dark. I gasped, spitting out the rag, my vision blurry with tears, my chest heaving with panic. A figure stood over me, striking Matt and Chris with a thin stick, a cane. The blows were swift, precise, sending them sprawling, their groans swallowed by the fog.

‚ÄúNow, now,‚Äù a familiar voice said, cool and calm, cutting through my terror like a lifeline. ‚ÄúThat is no way to treat a lady.‚Äù I wiped my eyes, my hands shaking so badly I could barely move. It was him, the silver-haired man, standing tall, his cane at his side like a gentleman at a ball. His blue eyes glinted in the dark, his smile sharp and dangerous, but in that moment, it was the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd ever seen. Relief flooded through me, mixed with a lingering fear that made my heart stutter. The three men scrambled to their feet, shouting, their faces twisted with anger, and charged him.

Jake went first, swinging wildly. The silver-haired man barely moved, just flicked his cane, striking Jake across the face. Blood sprayed, and Jake collapsed, groaning, his face a mess of red. Chris lunged next, but the man sidestepped, tripping him with the cane‚Äôs tip, sending him sprawling. Matt tried to attack from behind, but the silver-haired man spun, grabbing his wrist and flipping him onto the ground with effortless grace, like a dancer in a nightmare. He pressed the cane to Matt‚Äôs throat, his smile never wavering as Matt choked and gasped, his eyes wide with fear. Chris tried again, but the man caught his fist, squeezing until Chris whimpered and sank to his knees. A sickening crack followed as the man snapped his wrist, then kicked him in the face, the sound dull and final.

He turned to Matt, still pinned under the cane, and struck him across the head with the silver orb, the impact echoing in the quiet. Then Jake staggered to his feet, his face bloody, his eyes burning with rage. He charged with a roar, but the silver-haired man stepped aside, grabbing Jake by the throat and lifting him off the ground like he weighed nothing. His blue eyes glowed brighter, unnatural in the dark, and my breath caught, a new kind of fear mixing with my relief.

‚ÄúYou really should be more careful when out so late,‚Äù he said, his voice low, almost playful, but with an edge that made my skin crawl. ‚ÄúDangerous people lurk in the dark corners of the night.‚Äù

His mouth opened, and I saw them, two long, sharp fangs glinting in the faint light. My heart stopped, my body frozen as Jake‚Äôs eyes widened, his scream cut off as the man sank his teeth into his neck. Jake‚Äôs body jerked, then went limp, his face draining of color, his eyes glassy and lifeless. The silver-haired man dropped him, letting him crumple to the ground like a broken doll. He stood there for a moment, head tilted back, arms spread, as if savoring the moment, like a man standing in the rain, relishing the taste of blood. The sight sent a shiver through me, my mind reeling with horror and awe.

I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt breathe. My body was frozen, my mind screaming to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt obey. My heart pounded, a chaotic mix of terror and gratitude swirling in my chest. He had saved me, but at what cost? He turned to me, his smile unchanged, blood glistening on his lips, his eyes glowing faintly in the dark. I flinched, throwing my arms up, my breath hitching as I waited for the end, my body trembling with the certainty that I was next.

But nothing happened.

‚ÄúAre you alright, Miss Skyler?‚Äù His voice was gentle now, almost kind, a stark contrast to the violence I‚Äôd just witnessed. I lowered my arms, trembling, my hands shaking so badly I could barely control them. He stood over me, his gloved hand extended once more, his eyes softer but still piercing, like they could see every fear, every thought in my head. My chest heaved, my breath ragged, my mind a tangled mess of relief, fear, and something else, something I couldn‚Äôt name.

I stared at his hand, my heart still racing, my body aching from the struggle. My mind screamed to run, to get away from this thing, this creature who had just torn through three men like they were nothing. His eyes held me, and despite the fear, there was a strange warmth in his gaze, a promise of safety that felt both real and impossible.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said, his smile warm but still edged with something dangerous, something that made my pulse quicken. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe. You have my word.‚Äù

I took his hand, my fingers shaking, and he pulled me to my feet with ease, his touch cool but steady. I fixed my clothes, my hands fumbling, my mind reeling as I tried to process what had just happened. The bodies of Jake, Matt, and Chris lay scattered around us, motionless, their faces pale and lifeless in the fog. My stomach churned, bile rising in my throat, but I couldn‚Äôt look away. They had been my classmates, people I thought I could trust, and now they were gone. I should have felt relief, but all I felt was a hollow, aching fear, mixed with a gratitude so intense it made my chest hurt. This man, this creature, had saved me, but the sight of his fangs, the blood on his lips, lingered in my mind, a reminder that he was no hero.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely audible, trembling with the weight of what I‚Äôd seen. My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking, my legs weak as I stood there, caught between wanting to run and wanting to collapse. He gave a slight bow, his cane tapping the ground, *clink*, the sound sending a fresh shiver through me.

‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù he said, his voice smooth, almost soothing, but it did little to calm the storm in my chest. ‚ÄúNow, I think it‚Äôs time that you should be getting home, Miss Skyler.‚Äù I glanced at the bodies, my heart racing, my mind struggling to make sense of it all.¬†

‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù I asked, my voice small, my eyes flicking to the lifeless forms in the fog. He chuckled, a sound that sent a chill down my spine, not entirely unpleasant but laced with something dark.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll dispose of these creatures in a‚Ä¶ kindly manner.‚Äù I frowned, a new question burning through the haze of my fear.¬†

‚ÄúWas that you? Following me?‚Äù My voice trembled, but I needed to know, needed to understand why he was here, why he had saved me. His smile widened, his eyes glinting with something almost playful.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ why were you following me?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking, my hands clenching into fists to steady myself.

He tilted his head, his smile cryptic, his voice smooth as silk. ‚ÄúSome shadows move to guard the light, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù I swallowed hard, his words twisting in my mind, offering no real answer. Suspicion gnawed at me, and I pressed further.

‚ÄúDid you know those men were going to attack me?‚Äù My voice was steadier now, though my heart still raced. His smile didn‚Äôt falter, his blue eyes gleaming with an unsettling glint.

‚ÄúThe night whispers its secrets to those who listen.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I demanded, my voice rising slightly, frustration tightening my chest. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù He took a step closer, his presence overwhelming, his silver hair catching the faint light like a ghost.

‚ÄúSome hearts are stained long before they act. I merely read the stains.‚Äù I glanced at the bodies around us, their lifeless forms half-hidden in the fog, then back at him, my eyes narrowing with suspicion.¬†

‚ÄúIf you were protecting me, why follow me like that? Why creep around in the dark?‚Äù My voice trembled, sharp with frustration, not anger, but a desperate need for answers. I held his gaze, my heart pounding, my fingers digging into my palms.

He stepped forward slowly, his movements graceful, deliberate, like a predator closing in. He leaned in, his face inches from mine, his lips so close to my ear I could feel his breath, cool and steady.¬†

‚ÄúBecause I love the smell of fear before the hunt,‚Äù he whispered, his voice low and intimate, sending a shiver down my spine.

A cold dread washed over me, my blood turning to ice, my body trembling as his words sank in. My frustration dissolved, replaced by a primal fear that rooted me to the spot. My mind screamed that he was dangerous, that I should run, but my feet wouldn‚Äôt move, caught in the spell of his gaze. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely a whisper, shuddering with fear and a strange, unwanted curiosity.

He chuckled, placing a finger to his nose and winking, a gesture so playful it was almost disarming. ‚ÄúThat would be telling.‚Äù

Before I could react, he waved his hand in front of my face, a quick, fluid motion. The world blurred, my vision swimming. My body felt weightless for a moment, like I was falling through the fog.¬†

Suddenly, I was standing in front of my apartment building. My backpack and books were neatly stacked on the steps, untouched, as if nothing had happened. I spun around, my heart pounding, scanning the street for any sign of him, but it was empty. No fog, no clinking, no silver-haired man. The night was clear now, the street lights brighter, but the silence felt wrong, like it was hiding something. My chest ached, not just with the fading adrenaline but with a hollow, gnawing feeling, like I‚Äôd lost something vital.

I touched my heart, my fingers trembling, my breath uneven. My mind replayed the night, the clinking, his glowing eyes, the blood on his lips, the way he saved me. I should have been terrified, and part of me was, my body still shaking with the memory of his fangs, the lifeless bodies in the fog. Yet, there was something else, something I couldn‚Äôt shake, a strange, reckless longing, a pull toward him that made no sense.

I stood there, frozen on the steps, my hand pressed against my chest, feeling the frantic beat of my heart. The night‚Äôs horrors played on a loop in my mind: Jake‚Äôs cruel grin, the rag in my mouth, the silver-haired man‚Äôs fangs sinking into his neck. I should have run inside, locked the door, and buried myself under the covers, but my feet wouldn‚Äôt move.¬†

My breath steadied, but my mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. I was terrified of him, of what he was, of the ease with which he‚Äôd killed, the bloodlust in his eyes as he stood over Jake‚Äôs body. Yet‚Ä¶ I was grateful, so grateful that it hurt. A deep, aching gratitude for the way he‚Äôd saved me, protected me when I was helpless. His voice echoed in my head, smooth and gentle, promising safety, but his words about the hunt, the way he‚Äôd inhaled my fear, sent shivers down my spine. I felt torn, caught between terror and fascination, my body still trembling from the night‚Äôs trauma but my heart pulled toward him, like a moth to a flame I knew would burn me.

I stared into the dark, half-expecting to see those glowing blue eyes and silver hair watching me from the shadows, half-hoping I would. My heart raced, not just with fear but with a twisted, unwanted curiosity. What was he? A monster, a savior, or something else entirely? The question burned in my mind, but so did his smile, his voice, the way he‚Äôd stood over me like a guardian and a predator all at once. I felt like I was standing on the edge of something vast and unknown, a pull toward him that defied reason, that scared me as much as it intrigued me. My mom‚Äôs voice echoed in my head, her Sunday calls urging me to trust my gut, but my gut was a mess, torn between running from him and wanting to know more. I hated that part of me, the reckless part that wanted to see him again, to understand why he‚Äôd chosen me, why he‚Äôd followed me, why he‚Äôd saved me.

I stood there for a long moment, my hand on my chest, my breath steadying but my mind racing. The night was quiet, but it felt alive, like it was watching me, waiting. Finally, I turned, picked up my books, and walked inside, my legs heavy, my heart conflicted. As I closed the door behind me, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was still out there, somewhere in the dark, his silver hair glinting in the moonlight, his eyes following me. And despite everything, despite the fear, the blood, the horror, a part of me hoped he was.

I was severely burnt out on dating. I was the type of guy who was compulsively on apps despite not getting matches, would hit the bars frequently, and even dabble to into the pickup artist space of ‚Äúdaygame cold approach.‚Äù I felt like I had to constantly relentlessly pursue a relationship, or I‚Äôd never end up in one. However, through some journaling and introspection, I was able to realize how pervasive an effect this mindset was having on my life, and come up with a plan to overcome it. I think a lot more guys (and maybe even girls) than realize it are stuck in this compulsive loop of defining their value based on whether a prospective partner likes them or not. I‚Äôm still very much in like step 18 of this, but wanted to share my journey and see if other wants to take it with me!

**Step 1: Understand your attachment style**

I can‚Äôt put links here, but there are plenty of quizzes out there.¬† If you‚Äôre reading this though, I imagine you‚Äôre struggling with either anxious, disorganized, or avoidant attachment.¬† I‚Äôm anxiously attached, so this advice is heavily geared towards that.¬† My core idea of taking a break on dating isn‚Äôt helpful for avoidants‚Ä¶ but I also imagine mostly anxious people are going to be the ones feeling in a similarly burnt out place as me with dating.

**Anxious Attachment**¬†(the focus of this post): an insecure attachment pattern involving a strong desire for closeness to others accompanied with a fear of abandonment.¬† People with this style will often crave reassurance, validation, and come on too strong to partners.¬† They may also view a relationship as a more essential part of their self esteem than secure people.

**Disorganized Attachment**¬†(also may benefit from this post‚Ä¶ though some of it may play into feelings of being undeserving): an attachment pattern characterized by wanting intimacy, but not feeling deserving of it, and struggling to function appropriately in a relationship.¬† Often stems from trauma.

**Avoidant Attachment**¬†(this post may not be as helpful)**:**¬†an attachment pattern involving discomfort with emotional intimacy, a strong desire for independence, and difficulty trusting others.

**Secure Attachment**¬†(you probably aren‚Äôt burnt out on dating to begin with): a healthy attachment pattern where individuals feel comfortable with intimacy, but not so desperate for it that they allow it to override their own needs and identity.

**Step 2: Understand cognitive distortions & reframing**

You can google for a full list, but below are some key ones that I‚Äôve found have helped me to understand.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**¬†swinging between extremes when analyzing a situation.¬† You‚Äôre either killing it, or you‚Äôre a total loser.¬† Leads to making mistakes like skipping a whole day of healthy habits because you missed the first habit of the day, so what‚Äôs the point?¬† Runs hand in hand with¬†**perfectionism,**¬†which is a huge obstacle in self-improvement we‚Äôre trying to overcome.
* **Mind Reading**: assuming what someone else is thinking without adequate evidence.¬† For example, assuming people at a party are making fun of you, by over interpreting small glances, when you haven‚Äôt a heard a single word they‚Äôve said.
* **Fortune Telling**: predicting the outcome of future events without adequate evidence.¬† For example, you might assume the girl you met at your meetup event would definitely reject you if you ask her out, so you just don‚Äôt ask her out.
* **Discounting the Positive**: having a tendency to focus on the negatives of a situation without acknowledging the positives.¬† For example, you may have a day of work where you were overall very productive, but you‚Äôll ignore that and fixate on the 30 minute phone break you took.
* **Labeling**¬†/¬†**Black-or-White Thinking**: assigning a hard ‚Äúlabel‚Äù to something rather than acknowledging the gray areas.¬† For example, if you told a joke that didn‚Äôt go off well, you might label yourself as ‚Äúunfunny‚Äù or ‚Äúawkward‚Äù, extrapolating that a few instances mean an inescapable identity.¬† Can lead to having a shame-based identity rather than accepting you are a human being who‚Äôs allowed to make mistakes.
* **Catastrophizing**: projecting that the worst case scenario will inevitably happen.¬† For ex: if I ask out this one girl at the coffee shop, she‚Äôll reject me, post about the experience online, then everyone in town will think I‚Äôm a creep and avoid me.
* **Hyper-Moralism**; viewing minor faults as major moral failings.¬† For ex: a potential new friend you met tells one slightly insensitivejoke, and you assume they‚Äôre a bad person and don‚Äôt pursue the friendship.¬† It leads to having too high of standards of others and sabotaging potentially good connections.¬†
* **Self-Blame**: attributing blame to yourself even when not warranted.¬† Goes hand in hand with omnipotence bias‚Ä¶ overestimating your own power or influence.¬†¬†
* **Savior Complex**: believing it‚Äôs your duty to fix others.¬† Can lead to pursuing relationships with people who aren‚Äôt ready for them, thinking you can make them ready.
* **Pseudo-Compassion**: taking on others‚Äô pain excessive to feel morally good.¬† For ex: 75% of your free time is spent being an Instagram activist over a hot button political issue currently.¬† It‚Äôs good to be involved in seeking change (especially now when we need it more than ever), but if you‚Äôre ignoring your own basic needs just to cry on the internet about an issue‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unhealthy.
* **Approval Addiction**: constantly seeking reassurance.
* **Guilt Inflation**: feeling excessive guilt for something that doesn‚Äôt justify it.
* **Hypervigilance**: constantly scanning for threats or opportunities.¬† Leads to being on edge all the time.¬† For me, this would manifest in seeking dating opportunities.¬† I‚Äôd go to clubs and not even enjoy the music because I was so busy trying to find an ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to talk to someone.¬† It encourages compulsive and unnatural behavior.

Now that we have a good understanding of common cognitive distortions, we need to reframe them.¬† There are articles from professionals out there that will better explain this than me, so I‚Äôll just give some examples of reframing from my own journal:

* *I was mind reading when I assumed my female friend I was hanging out with was uncomfortable with how I was low key flirting with her.¬† She gave me no signs of discomfort and continued to engage with me via text after our hangout with the same level of enthusiasm.¬† There‚Äôs no sign she‚Äôs uncomfortable around me.*
* *I discounted the positive with my diet today.¬† While I snacked a little bit more than ideal, I still ate super healthy meals, even when temptation of eating unhealthy ones was super prevalent.¬† I‚Äôm proud of the self control I showed and how I‚Äôve lost over 10 lbs lately, one minor setback doesn‚Äôt take anything away from that!*
* *I am inflating my guilt regarding going out to that concert when my allergies symptoms were flaring up.¬† I showed no signs of having contagious illness, had no fever, and I can‚Äôt pause my life for a whole season while dealing with recurring allergies.¬† I deserve to be able to engage in large group events I want without feeling unnecessary guilt that I may be spreading illness to other, when the probability I have an actual contagious illness is slim.*

**Step 3: Journal daily**

Build on the understanding of cognitive distortions in a daily journal.¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs a sample list of prompts you can start with:

* *What was the story of my day (in detail)?*
* *What cognitive distortions did I notice in my thinking today?¬† How can I reframe that?*
* *Is there any way I was impatient in seeking out connection or opportunity today?¬† Why is that and how could I react different next time?*
* *What am I grateful for today (at least 3 things)?*
* *What am I proud of myself for (at least 3 things)?*
* *What am I excited for (at least 3 things - include one mundane thing)?*

Use Chat GPT to help find more prompts that could be useful to your specific problems (based on recurring cognitive distortions that come up).¬† One huge thing that‚Äôs been helpful to me has been pasting my daily journal into the same Chat GPT thread every day, as it helps me to spot patterns in my behavior and offer behavior tweaks (use with a grain of salt‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just one tool).

**Step 4: Define what you want in a partner**

Do a journaling session where you think about what you actually want in a long-term partner.¬† Don‚Äôt be outrageously ambitious, but list out key¬†**dealbreakers**¬†that you think a partner possessing would make it borderline impossible to have a fulfilling life with them.¬† Also list out¬†**preferences,**¬†which are things you think you‚Äôd like more, but you‚Äôll be flexible on.¬† You should limit physical dealbreakers you have as much as possible, because when looking for a long-term relationship, as long as you‚Äôre reasonably attracted to them (like I say below, 7/10), the rest of the stuff matters so much more.

* *My dealbreakers:*¬†politically aligned (enough), emotionally available, a 7/10 attractive (to me), religiously aligned (enough), has friends and interests, employed or on track to be, 21+, fun to banter with
* *My preferences:*¬†shorter than me, ambiverted, sexually adventurous, good sense of humor, open to experience

**Step 5: Ask yourself: ‚Äúwould my ideal partner likely be attracted to current me?‚Äù**

If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôd bet the answer is no.¬† That‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow, but it‚Äôs also low key freeing.¬† It makes you realize, ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm exerting so much energy to try to find a partner who there‚Äôs such a low probability would be interested in me.¬† I wonder what kind of person I could become if I let go of that goal for now and focused on myself?‚Äù

As we move forward, we‚Äôre going to work towards building the person who is attractive to that ideal partner.

**Step 6: Understand your anxieties, insecurities, disruptive patterns, & unmet wants**

If you did a good job of defining your ideal partner, then that partner will be in alignment into someone who‚Äôd desire a better version of you that you can realistically become.¬† So, to determine what goals you need to work on to become attractive to them, you need to understand what key issues you feel you‚Äôre facing in life, and address them!¬† Again, I‚Äôll continue using examples from my journey.

* *Anxieties (what I worry about)*: I struggle with OCD and reassurance seeking, I worry about money due to a lack of emergency fund.
* *Insecurities (where I don‚Äôt feel good enough):*¬†I have a BMI of 41.¬† I have anxious attachment style.¬† I drive a car old enough to smoke.
* *Disruptive Patterns (things that distract me):*¬†I‚Äôm obsessed with the pursuit of a relationship and watch way too much dating content.¬† I‚Äôm addicted to my phone.¬† I struggle to focus, even on things I enjoy.¬†
* *Wants (what I desire but don‚Äôt have):*¬†my friends moved away after college‚Ä¶ I want to rebuild my social circle.¬† I like my career path, but I feel like the ambition that defined me at a younger age has faded too much and would feel proud if I achieved more.

**Step 7: Create a ‚ÄúDating Baseline.‚Äù¬† Stop intentionally dating until you reach it.**¬†

By intentional dating, I mean the following: using dating apps, going out at night just to meet someone, doing any form of ‚Äúcold approach.‚Äù¬† If something happens naturally to you, all the better, just don‚Äôt¬†*seek*¬†it.

For building this dating baseline, I took my step 6 realizations, I listed what would address them in an ideal manor.¬† BMI of 22.5, 6 months emergency fund, make 10 new friends, earn 3 promotions, average 30 minutes meditation daily, average less than 2 hours screen time daily, journal daily, own a new car.

**Step 8: Cut your dating baseline to a more realistic version**

Those goals I just listed‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre pretty ambitious and would take several years to reach.¬† That would burn me out even worse.¬† So what I did is cut them down to ‚Äúacceptable versions.‚Äù¬† I‚Äôll keep working to the ideal versions long-term, but hitting the acceptable ones will queue me to get back on the apps with premium accounts, and start putting myself back out there irl.

My ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù baseline: BMI of 30, 3 new friends, 1 promotion, 10 minutes meditation daily, less than 4 hours screen time daily, journal most days, 4 months emergency fund, own a used car made 2017 or later.

**Step 9: Turn them into S.M.A.R.T. Goals**

Specific (clearly defined), Measurable (has metrics to track progress), Achievable (reasonable to do), Relevant (aligned to your goals - we‚Äôve done this already!), Time-bound (has a deadline).¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs my examples:

* I will reach a BMI of 30 by 4/1/2026.¬† I will weigh in weekly with a goal of 1.5 lbs of weight loss on average / week.
* I will reach $10,000 in savings by 1/1/2026.¬† I will log my purchases on my budget bi-weekly, and aim to add $350 / paycheck to the emergency fund.
* I will make 3 new friends in my city by 1/1/2026.
* I will get promoted by 12/1/2025.¬† I will check in with my on my progress quarterly.
* I will average 10 minutes of daily meditation by 7/1/2025.¬† I will log my meditation daily and note trends in my weekly journal review.
* I will average less than 4 hours on my phone daily by 9/1/2025.¬† I will log my screen time daily and reflect on trends in my weekly review.
* I will own a used car made 2017 or later by 3/1/2026. I will add $180 / paycheck to my down payment fund, and begin researching new cars once that reaches $3,000.

**Step 10: Convert the goals into habits**

A lot of the ideas from this are jacked from Atomic Habits, so give that book a read if you haven‚Äôt!¬† To continue with my example:

* Eat 3 healthy meals / day and limit myself to 2 snacks / day
* Walk 15K steps / day
* Lift weights 3x / week
* Update my budget weekly
* Go to one new social event weekly
* Study 3x / week for the designation that would assist in getting my promotion
* Meditate 10 minutes / day
* Limit to 4 hours screen time on my phone

**Step 11: Simplify the habit to it‚Äôs lowest meaningful action**

I‚Äôve found in the past the biggest obstacle to building behavior change is wanting to go too fast too soon.¬† So, moderate these habits down to something actually doable.¬† Not something so little that it feels unmeaningful, but the smallest amount of work you can where it feels like you‚Äôre exerting yourself more than you‚Äôre used to.¬† To continue my example:

* Eat 2 healthy meals / day and limit to 4 snacks / day
* Walk 7K steps / day
* Watch a video on proper weight lifting form
* Update my budget monthly
* Go to one new social event monthly
* Study once weekly for the designation
* Meditate 5 minutes 5 times this week
* Simply track phone screen time

**Step 12: Adjust the ‚ÄúT‚Äù of S.M.A.R.T. Goals to reflect sustainable change pace**

Again, a lack of patience and this urgency to hit my goals (especially when accompanied by something like limiting dating until I reach them) has a tendency to lead to burn out.¬† So, work towards patience on the goals by making them have a longer time horizon.

* I will reach a BMI of 30 by 10/10/2026.¬† I will weigh in weekly with a goal of 1 lbs of weight loss on average / week.
* I will reach $10,000 in savings by 7/24/2026.¬† I will log my purchases on my budget bi-weekly, and aim to add $250 / paycheck to the emergency fund.
* I will make 3 new friends in my city by 6/1/2026.
* I will get promoted by 12/1/2026.¬† I will check in with my on my progress quarterly.¬† I expect I may actually get this sooner, but if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be patient!
* I will average 10 minutes of daily meditation by 9/1/2025.¬† I will log my meditation daily and note trends in my weekly journal review.
* I will average less than 4 hours on my phone daily by 11/1/2025.¬† I will log my screen time daily and reflect on trends in my weekly review.
* I will own a used car made 2017 or later by 6/1/2026. I will add $120 / paycheck to my down payment fund, and begin researching new cars once that reaches $3,000.

**Step 13: Build a daily habit tracker**

I use Notion for this, because that‚Äôs where I journal, but Google Sheets would be fine too.

Columns: days of the week (then a score one at the end, and a column called ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù)

Rows: the habits

Bonus: list out overambitious goals that might distract you to avoid tracking. For example, I don‚Äôt want to waste any energy or discipline: doing no fap, quitting video games, trying to get sick at chess, trying to run a 10K, trying to be a music blogger, etc‚Ä¶¬† all these things might sounds good on paper, but you only have the bandwidth to change so much about yourself at one time.¬† Focus on the meaningful habits that build towards the goals you actually care about, not the distracting but flashy ones that come up.¬† Unlike what the manosphere will tell you, you‚Äôre allowed to indulge in some stuff on occasion, just also be doing the hard work in other moments.

**Step 14: Level up habits gradually**

With the score column, if you hit the target habit the vast majority of the week (5/7), then you‚Äôre ready to add difficulty to it, by progressively overloading.¬†

Walk 7K steps / day ‚Üí Walk 8K steps / day (week 2) ‚Üí Walk 9K steps / day (week 3), etc‚Ä¶

Meditate 5 minutes 5 times / week ‚Üí Meditate 6 minutes 5 times / week (week 2)

If you didn‚Äôt hit your target habits 5 days or more, don‚Äôt get discouraged, just get back at it next week.¬† Also, don‚Äôt level yourself down on a habit unless you‚Äôve missed it 3 consecutive weeks.¬† We don‚Äôt want to give up that leveling up unless it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs been broken.

**Step 15: Update your journal w/ prompts more tailored to your goals**

The baseline journal prompt is good for getting to know yourself better, but once you do, you need to go deeper into the struggles you face.¬† Some prompts I added:

* Did I avoid any risk out of fear or perfectionism?
* Did my OCD ruminations spiral or amplify today?¬† How did I disengage?
* What uncertainty did I let myself sit in today?
* What was my relationship with food like today?
* Was I physically active today?
* Did I spend money mindfully today?
* When I did I feel present and unpresent today?
* How was my phone use today?¬† Did I feel in control or pulled in by it?
* What‚Äôs one good connection I had today?
* What‚Äôs one way I was compassionate to myself today?

Again, Chat GPT is a great resources for creating prompts tailored to you specifically (use with discretion)

**Step 16: Introduce meditation on patience**

It‚Äôs going to take a while to reach these goals.¬† 18 months for me.¬† Maybe less or longer for you.¬† So learn to be patient.¬† I‚Äôm not an expert on meditation, but just going on youtube and searching X minute meditation on patience has yielded good results for me.

**Step 17: Disconnect from dating content**

During this period of not initially dating, watching lots of dating content will trigger that desire to go seek out a relationship again, so it‚Äôs best to avoid.¬† Even romantic dramas or rom coms can do you this to an extent, so just be vigilant when engaging in those.

**Step 18: Reflect on your progress regularly**

I recommended a weekly journal review, and a monthly journal review process to see where you‚Äôre at with your goals.¬† Set benchmarks for where you‚Äôll want to be at the with the goal next month, and if you‚Äôre not, try to meditate on why, and consider strategies you can use to get back on track.¬† You can then extend the ‚ÄúT‚Äù of your goals a bit, if you feel you‚Äôve felt so far behind that you‚Äôre not on track. ¬† But hopefully, you‚Äôve already set it with long enough horizon that there‚Äôs some in built room for slipping up.

**Step 19: Introduce more organic social opportunities into your life**

Important in getting away from over urgent pursuit of relationships and healing anxious attachment is forming steady community in your life.¬† Go to meetups, join that sports league you‚Äôre interested in, get involved in a local discord, etc‚Ä¶ This will make eventually reintegrating dating back into your life a lot easier (and may even lead to an organic dating opportunity before you reach your baseline!)

**Step 20: Hit your baseline**

You‚Äôll eventually reach your goals!¬† When you do, take some time to celebrate.¬† Do something big, like go on a weekend trip to another city, indulge in your favorite meals, etc‚Ä¶¬† I find a lot of goal oriented people really struggle to savor accomplishment.¬† You‚Äôll hit a goal, and be on to chasing the next, and other than one euphoric moment‚Ä¶ you never feel satisfied.¬† Don‚Äôt do that when you hit this baseline.¬† Go all out and really appreciate the commitment you put into you!

**Step 21: Reintegrate dating & cast a wide net**

You‚Äôre now ready to date, so go for it!¬† From a place of more security, you‚Äôll know your value and come at things from more of a buyer's mindset than a beggars.¬†

As for actually getting the dates, there‚Äôs lot of options.¬† Get on the dating apps (especially Hinge & Bumble).¬† Invest in premium accounts, as you can use them more intentionally and set more preferences to find people you‚Äôre actually interested in.¬† Invest in high quality photos of yourself.¬† View it all as an investment into find a quality partner.

Go to more social events like I said earlier.¬† Logan Ury, whose book How Not To Die Alone is a great read at this stage of the process (but not before), has a matrix she uses on events that‚Äôs really helpful.¬† On one axis is ‚Äúevents you‚Äôd like‚Äù on the other is ‚Äúevents where you‚Äôd likely meet someone you like‚Äù... pick events in the top right corner (that you‚Äôll enjoy and meet people you‚Äôll enjoy).

Don‚Äôt be afraid to be brave in public on occasion.¬† See a really your type person at a coffee shop, go start a conversation (don‚Äôt ‚Äúhit on them‚Äù, just talk like an adult and flirt a bit).¬† A great line to ask someone out is just ‚ÄúI really enjoyed this conversation, would you like to continue it over drinks sometime?‚Äù¬†¬†

**Step 22: Maintain your dealbreakers, flexibilize on your preferences**

Be intentional about not settling for someone you know won‚Äôt be compatible with you long-term.¬† If she‚Äôs a Christian right winger, and you‚Äôre a socialist atheist‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care how good the sex is, it‚Äôs not going to work.¬† Date with long-term compatibility in mind, not focused on how much of a ‚Äúspark‚Äù you have.¬†¬†

However, don‚Äôt be rigid on your preferences.¬† If you‚Äôre a woman who prefers dating someone 4‚Äô taller than you, don‚Äôt filter out all guys who don‚Äôt meet that on dating apps.¬† Their might be a guy out there who aligns perfectly with you religiously, & politically, is really fun to talk to, is really attractive, and is emotionally mature that you‚Äôre missing out on because you think a preference is a dealbreaker.¬†¬†

**Step 23: Be intentional (externally & internally) in the relationship**¬†

Once you actually get in a relationship, communicate well with your partner.¬† Don‚Äôt become complacent and let go of your goals just because forming a relationship was the main reason you started down this path.¬† Hopefully, you‚Äôll have rediscovered that lust for life that was missing when obsessed with dating.¬† With that in mind, if the relationship gets toxic, don‚Äôt be afraid to leave it.¬† Again, you now have a buyer‚Äôs mindset, and you don‚Äôt have to take a whole bunch of shit just out of fear of being alone‚Ä¶ because you‚Äôre a catch and have options.",3,1748712912.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm stuck between trusting my gut and not wanting to lose my mind over something that might not be real. I‚Äôve been married to my husband for ten years‚Äîwe got married young, and our bond was battle-tested early through long distance when he was in the military and I was in nursing school. We‚Äôve always had a strong foundation of trust. Or so I thought. He‚Äôs now working in a welding/fabrication shop where there are only two women‚Äîone of whom I‚Äôll call Lon. She‚Äôs 8 years younger than me, 9 younger than my husband. I‚Äôm 30F, husband is 31M. I never felt threatened by her or anyone at work until recently. I first met Lon at his work Christmas party earlier this year. She was nice, polite, friendly... but something about her gave me weird vibes. My gut just felt uneasy, like maybe she had a thing for my husband. I mentioned it to him on the ride home‚Äîhe laughed it off and reminded me they‚Äôre just friends. He has a group of 4 friends at work, she is one of the 4. They all ride together for coffee runs, bring each other food, send Snapchats and Instagram reels‚Äîstuff I never really had a problem with. But over time, I started noticing little things that made me feel uneasy. Like him doing things for her, bringing her lotuses, bringing her lunch, etc.  We were out of town and at a candy story, he suggested ‚ÄúI need to find a dubai chocolate bar for Lon for her birthday, she really likes them‚Äù  meanwhile, I haven‚Äôt received a birthday, Mother‚Äôs Day, or Valentine‚Äôs Day gift in years. That stung. I tried to express this, but he brushed it off as me overreacting. The real tipping point came when he and a male coworker (who I trust) went to help Lon fix a wall in her trailer. I was already managing bedtime with two of our kids and needed him to help pick up our daughter from practice later that night. He said he‚Äôd be able to pick her up, but then 45 minutes before he texted me and said he couldn‚Äôt pick her up, and would be later than expected. So I had to get our other two girls out of bed to go pick her up. He didn‚Äôt get home until almost 10 PM. He knew I was mad. When we talked, I found out his male coworker left at 7:30, which meant he was alone with Lon in her house for nearly two hours. On a weeknight. While I was juggling everything at home. That crossed a line for me. I did express this to him and set a boundary (Which should have been common sense). He apologized and told me again: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a friend.‚Äù But the next day, another female coworker made a joke like, ‚ÄúSo what were you and Lon doing alone last night?‚Äù‚Äîwhich told me I‚Äôm not the only one who sees it. Even then, he didn‚Äôt understand why it was a problem. Since then, we‚Äôve had a few conversations about it. I‚Äôve told him how it feels like he‚Äôs giving the best parts of himself to someone else while I sit here feeling invisible. To his credit, he has really tried. He‚Äôs been more affectionate, brings me flowers, compliments me, makes more of an effort to show up emotionally. But... he‚Äôs still texting her, sending her reels, and Snapchatting her. Constantly. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to take his friend away from him. But I need support from him too.  I recently looked through his phone for the first time ever (we‚Äôve been together 12 years). I found nothing inappropriate, no messages that crossed a line. But my gut is still screaming. Something feels off. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs cheating‚Äîbut I do think she might have feelings for him. I can‚Äôt shake it. Then last week, Lon‚Äôs new boyfriend freaked out on her and specifically called out my husband. He told her that she doesn‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúentertaining all these other guys‚Äù and flipped out on her I guess. Which was relatable... Later that night, she texted my husband at 2 AM. He didn‚Äôt answer (we were asleep), but in the morning she told him she needed a friend to talk to about her bf. Apparently there was a physical altercation between him and another guy at a fire that night.  That morning after talking to her on the phone, he brought her a lotus and a dog bone he got her dog  ‚Äúto cheer her up.‚Äù I told him that crossed the original boundary that I set about not going there. But he said it wasn‚Äôt crossing a boundary because he didn‚Äôt go in her house. But WHY does he think it‚Äôs okay to be bringing her things.  I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm not comfortable with this friendship anymore. It feels like I‚Äôm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, and I really think she has feelings for him. I really do wholeheartedly trust him and know he will be loyal to me. It‚Äôs her that is bothering me.  I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat wife.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be paranoid or controlling. I don‚Äôt want to take away a friend from him. But I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit by everyone around me, even though I know my gut is trying to protect me. Am I crazy? Or is it okay to ask my husband to step back from this friendship outside of work, even if nothing has technically happened? Please help. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane.",2,1748712710.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

## key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of custom mylar bags depend heavily on several key features. Understanding these specifications will help you make informed decisions when selecting the right bags for your products.

**Material Composition:** Mylar, a biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (bopet) film, is the core material responsible for the bag's protective properties.

The specific grade and thickness of mylar used substantially impacts the bag's durability, puncture resistance, and barrier performance. Higher-quality mylar films offer superior protection against moisture, oxygen, and light, ensuring optimal preservation of the contents. Custom mylar bags are typically constructed with multiple layers, including mylar, polyethylene, and aluminum foil, to enhance their barrier properties and structural integrity. The arrangement and thickness of these layers can be customized to meet specific product requirements.**Custom Printing Options:** High-quality printing is essential for creating visually appealing and informative custom mylar bags.

Advanced printing technologies, such as digital printing and rotogravure, enable businesses to incorporate intricate designs, vibrant colors, and detailed product information onto the bags. Options for matte, gloss, and spot UV finishes provide additional versatility in creating a unique and eye-catching packaging solution. Moreover, the use of food-grade inks ensures that the printed designs are safe for direct contact with food products.

**Sealing and Closure Mechanisms:** Airtight sealing is crucial for preventing spoilage and maintaining product freshness.Custom mylar bags offer a variety of sealing options, including heat sealing, zipper closures, and resealable adhesive strips. Heat sealing provides the most secure and tamper-evident closure, while zipper closures and resealable strips offer added convenience for consumers. the choice of sealing mechanism depends on the specific product requirements and desired level of convenience. Many bags also incorporate tear notches for easy opening.

**Size and Shape Customization:** The ability to customize the size and shape of mylar bags ensures a perfect fit for the product being packaged.

Manufacturers offer a wide range of standard sizes and can also create custom-sized bags to accommodate unique product dimensions. Options for stand-up pouches,flat pouches,and gusseted bags provide additional flexibility in packaging design. Choosing the right size and shape optimizes storage space, reduces material waste, and enhances the overall presentation of the product.

**Specialty Features:** Beyond the core features, custom mylar bags can incorporate various specialty features to enhance functionality and appeal.

These include clear windows for product visibility, degassing valves for packaging coffee and other products that release gases, and tamper-evident seals for added security. embossed logos and holographic effects can further enhance the visual appeal and brand recognition of the bags. Selecting the appropriate specialty features can significantly enhance the value and attractiveness of the custom mylar bags.

Key features of custom mylar bags include:

* Various printing customization options

## Core Benefits

Custom mylar bags offer a range of benefits that extend beyond basic packaging, providing meaningful advantages for businesses and consumers alike.

**Enhanced Product Protection:** Mylar's superior barrier properties protect products from moisture, oxygen, light, and other environmental factors that can compromise their quality and freshness.

This is particularly crucial for food items, pharmaceuticals, and other sensitive products that require optimal preservation. By extending shelf life and preventing spoilage, custom mylar bags can significantly reduce waste and improve consumer satisfaction. as an example, coffee beans packed in custom mylar bags with degassing valves retain their aroma and flavor for a longer period compared to customary packaging.

**Elevated Branding and Marketing:** Custom mylar bags provide a powerful platform for showcasing brand identity and communicating product information.

High-quality printing and customizable designs allow businesses to create visually appealing packaging that captures consumers' attention and reinforces brand recognition. Clear product labeling, nutritional information, and attractive graphics can influence purchasing decisions and build customer loyalty. A well-designed custom mylar bag can serve as a miniature billboard,promoting the product and brand on store shelves.

**Increased Shelf Appeal:** Eye-catching packaging is essential for attracting customers in a competitive retail environment.

custom mylar bags can be designed with unique shapes, vibrant colors, and premium finishes to stand out from the competition. Transparent windows allow consumers to view the product inside, increasing their confidence in the purchase. stand-up pouches offer excellent shelf stability and maximize visual impact. Ultimately, attractive packaging can significantly increase sales and brand visibility.

**Improved Convenience for Consumers:** Resealable closures, tear notches, and easy-to-handle designs enhance the consumer experience.These features make it easier for consumers to access and store the product, promoting repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth. Zipper closures and resealable adhesive strips allow consumers to reseal the bag after opening, maintaining product freshness and preventing spills. This added convenience can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.

**Sustainable Packaging Options:** As environmental awareness grows, businesses are increasingly seeking sustainable packaging solutions.

Custom mylar bags made from recyclable or biodegradable materials offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging options. These bags can reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of packaging without compromising product protection or visual appeal. Opting for sustainable packaging solutions can enhance a brand's image and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.

1l02o3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1l02o3v/almost_5_months_postpartum_and_officially_below/,Almost 5 months postpartum and officially below my pre pregnancy weight!,"I know the purpose of the diet isn‚Äôt necessarily weight loss and I‚Äôve found many other benefits as well but I wanted to share my story. 

So I had my baby in January. Struggled to lose weight for 3 months because life and baby and hormones etc. I was always a bit chubby but I really ballooned during pregnancy. I started pregnancy at 223lb and ended it at 256lbs. When I started this diet on April 8th I was 246lbs.

Well I‚Äôve never been this heavy before. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 31F and it‚Äôs been literally weighing on me. Within 2 weeks I had lost 10lbs (I know, water weight) but I found that extremely motivating. I stuck by it. Started easy; chicken, beef, eggs, sardines, the occasional kosher fermented pickle for gut health and electrolytes. Only drank black coffee, water and lemon water. Not super strict I know but as someone addicted to carbs and taking care of a baby it worked for me. 

Before Mother‚Äôs Day I was at 230lbs, defs some weight loss there! Come post Mother‚Äôs Day I cheated and went back up to 236lbs within 2 days. Damn I thought. Real dingus moment. Time to get disciplined. 

So I‚Äôve been pretty strict since then. Hard to work out with a 4 month old baby on maternity leave but I tried. I‚Äôm walking everyday with the stroller. I‚Äôm doing stretches and body weight exercises everyday. I‚Äôm staying in ketosis. I‚Äôm staying hydrated. I‚Äôm trying to get good sleep. I‚Äôve been watching the scale drop almost everyday. 229.6. 229.2. 228.5. 227.8. Down down down she went. 

It‚Äôs now May 31 and today I‚Äôm at 222.2! It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs the lowest number I‚Äôve see in over a year! At my lowest I was 176lbs. Through poor choices I went up to 223 in 1.5 years before getting pregnant. My goal is to get to 200lbs and then see what I can do to get 180. I‚Äôm so motivated, I feel so much better about myself, my hair is so much healthier, my skin clearer, my energy higher and more stable, my mind stronger, you‚Äôve heard it all. 

I needed someone to celebrate with and couldn‚Äôt really post in the pregnancy subs cause I know they‚Äôre sensitive about weight there. But I am honestly so shocked at how much I‚Äôve learned about food and body‚Äôs since starting this journey. My eyes are open now and I can‚Äôt imagine going back to my old WOE. Thank you guys for teaching me and being with me on this journey while I get healthy for myself and my baby. ",2,1748712684.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I was hiking recently and kept finding interesting rocks but had no idea what they were. I got tired of Googling and built a simple app to solve this problem.

The¬†video shows it in action - snap a photo and get instant geological details powered by Google's Gemini API. The multimodal AI analyzes¬†visual characteristics while pulling from its knowledge base, which¬†honestly works way better than I expected.

I built it using native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and optimized it for quick responses (under 3 seconds). I also¬†programmed it to roast you if you try¬†to identify something that's not a rock (e.g., your coffee mug!)

For¬†monetization, users receive five free¬†premium identifications to try it risk-free. Users can then sign up for a weekly (which further comes with a 3-day free trial) or annual subscription.

The app is currently under review. I will post the link here¬†once it is published (hopefully soon!). I would love to gather initial thoughts and feedback from the community on iOS app development best practices. I'm also happy to answer questions about the technical aspects and/or share my learnings about prompt engineering and multimodal AI.",1,1748712567.0,ProductHunters,0,1.0,False
1l02m6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1l02m6r/burnt_out_on_dating_i_rebuilt_my_mindset_through/,"Burnt Out on Dating, I Rebuilt My Mindset Through Journaling ‚Äî Here's the Plan That Helped Me (The Dating Baseline) - UPDATED","Hello all, I posted a version of this that I had Chat GPT edit last weekend, and people completely ignored the ideas behind it just to roast the use of Chat GPT, so when I got a bit more time this week, I re-wrote it for more clarity of my perspective.

Disclaimer: this is not medical advice, just sharing a plan that‚Äôs working for me!

I was severely burnt out on dating. I was the type of guy who was compulsively on apps despite not getting matches, would hit the bars frequently, and even dabble to into the pickup artist space of ‚Äúdaygame cold approach.‚Äù I felt like I had to constantly relentlessly pursue a relationship, or I‚Äôd never end up in one. However, through some journaling and introspection, I was able to realize how pervasive an effect this mindset was having on my life, and come up with a plan to overcome it. I think a lot more guys (and maybe even girls) than realize it are stuck in this compulsive loop of defining their value based on whether a prospective partner likes them or not. I‚Äôm still very much in like step 18 of this, but wanted to share my journey and see if other wants to take it with me!



**Step 1: Understand your attachment style**

I can‚Äôt put links here, but there are plenty of quizzes out there.¬† If you‚Äôre reading this though, I imagine you‚Äôre struggling with either anxious, disorganized, or avoidant attachment.¬† I‚Äôm anxiously attached, so this advice is heavily geared towards that.¬† My core idea of taking a break on dating isn‚Äôt helpful for avoidants‚Ä¶ but I also imagine mostly anxious people are going to be the ones feeling in a similarly burnt out place as me with dating.

**Anxious Attachment** (the focus of this post): an insecure attachment pattern involving a strong desire for closeness to others accompanied with a fear of abandonment.¬† People with this style will often crave reassurance, validation, and come on too strong to partners.¬† They may also view a relationship as a more essential part of their self esteem than secure people.

**Disorganized Attachment** (also may benefit from this post‚Ä¶ though some of it may play into feelings of being undeserving): an attachment pattern characterized by wanting intimacy, but not feeling deserving of it, and struggling to function appropriately in a relationship.¬† Often stems from trauma.

**Avoidant Attachment** (this post may not be as helpful)**:** an attachment pattern involving discomfort with emotional intimacy, a strong desire for independence, and difficulty trusting others.

**Secure Attachment** (you probably aren‚Äôt burnt out on dating to begin with): a healthy attachment pattern where individuals feel comfortable with intimacy, but not so desperate for it that they allow it to override their own needs and identity.



**Step 2: Understand cognitive distortions & reframing**

You can google for a full list, but below are some key ones that I‚Äôve found have helped me to understand.

* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** swinging between extremes when analyzing a situation.¬† You‚Äôre either killing it, or you‚Äôre a total loser.¬† Leads to making mistakes like skipping a whole day of healthy habits because you missed the first habit of the day, so what‚Äôs the point?¬† Runs hand in hand with **perfectionism,** which is a huge obstacle in self-improvement we‚Äôre trying to overcome.
* **Mind Reading**: assuming what someone else is thinking without adequate evidence.¬† For example, assuming people at a party are making fun of you, by over interpreting small glances, when you haven‚Äôt a heard a single word they‚Äôve said.
* **Fortune Telling**: predicting the outcome of future events without adequate evidence.¬† For example, you might assume the girl you met at your meetup event would definitely reject you if you ask her out, so you just don‚Äôt ask her out.
* **Discounting the Positive**: having a tendency to focus on the negatives of a situation without acknowledging the positives.¬† For example, you may have a day of work where you were overall very productive, but you‚Äôll ignore that and fixate on the 30 minute phone break you took.
* **Labeling** / **Black-or-White Thinking**: assigning a hard ‚Äúlabel‚Äù to something rather than acknowledging the gray areas.¬† For example, if you told a joke that didn‚Äôt go off well, you might label yourself as ‚Äúunfunny‚Äù or ‚Äúawkward‚Äù, extrapolating that a few instances mean an inescapable identity.¬† Can lead to having a shame-based identity rather than accepting you are a human being who‚Äôs allowed to make mistakes.
* **Catastrophizing**: projecting that the worst case scenario will inevitably happen.¬† For ex: if I ask out this one girl at the coffee shop, she‚Äôll reject me, post about the experience online, then everyone in town will think I‚Äôm a creep and avoid me.
* **Hyper-Moralism**; viewing minor faults as major moral failings.¬† For ex: a potential new friend you met tells one slightly insensitivejoke, and you assume they‚Äôre a bad person and don‚Äôt pursue the friendship.¬† It leads to having too high of standards of others and sabotaging potentially good connections.¬†
* **Self-Blame**: attributing blame to yourself even when not warranted.¬† Goes hand in hand with omnipotence bias‚Ä¶ overestimating your own power or influence.¬†¬†
* **Savior Complex**: believing it‚Äôs your duty to fix others.¬† Can lead to pursuing relationships with people who aren‚Äôt ready for them, thinking you can make them ready.
* **Pseudo-Compassion**: taking on others‚Äô pain excessive to feel morally good.¬† For ex: 75% of your free time is spent being an Instagram activist over a hot button political issue currently.¬† It‚Äôs good to be involved in seeking change (especially now when we need it more than ever), but if you‚Äôre ignoring your own basic needs just to cry on the internet about an issue‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unhealthy.
* **Approval Addiction**: constantly seeking reassurance.
* **Guilt Inflation**: feeling excessive guilt for something that doesn‚Äôt justify it.
* **Hypervigilance**: constantly scanning for threats or opportunities.¬† Leads to being on edge all the time.¬† For me, this would manifest in seeking dating opportunities.¬† I‚Äôd go to clubs and not even enjoy the music because I was so busy trying to find an ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to talk to someone.¬† It encourages compulsive and unnatural behavior.

Now that we have a good understanding of common cognitive distortions, we need to reframe them.¬† There are articles from professionals out there that will better explain this than me, so I‚Äôll just give some examples of reframing from my own journal:

* *I was mind reading when I assumed my female friend I was hanging out with was uncomfortable with how I was low key flirting with her.¬† She gave me no signs of discomfort and continued to engage with me via text after our hangout with the same level of enthusiasm.¬† There‚Äôs no sign she‚Äôs uncomfortable around me.*
* *I discounted the positive with my diet today.¬† While I snacked a little bit more than ideal, I still ate super healthy meals, even when temptation of eating unhealthy ones was super prevalent.¬† I‚Äôm proud of the self control I showed and how I‚Äôve lost over 10 lbs lately, one minor setback doesn‚Äôt take anything away from that!*
* *I am inflating my guilt regarding going out to that concert when my allergies symptoms were flaring up.¬† I showed no signs of having contagious illness, had no fever, and I can‚Äôt pause my life for a whole season while dealing with recurring allergies.¬† I deserve to be able to engage in large group events I want without feeling unnecessary guilt that I may be spreading illness to other, when the probability I have an actual contagious illness is slim.*

**Step 3: Journal daily**

Build on the understanding of cognitive distortions in a daily journal.¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs a sample list of prompts you can start with:

* *What was the story of my day (in detail)?*
* *What cognitive distortions did I notice in my thinking today?¬† How can I reframe that?*
* *Is there any way I was impatient in seeking out connection or opportunity today?¬† Why is that and how could I react different next time?*
* *What am I grateful for today (at least 3 things)?*
* *What am I proud of myself for (at least 3 things)?*
* *What am I excited for (at least 3 things - include one mundane thing)?*

Use Chat GPT to help find more prompts that could be useful to your specific problems (based on recurring cognitive distortions that come up).¬† One huge thing that‚Äôs been helpful to me has been pasting my daily journal into the same Chat GPT thread every day, as it helps me to spot patterns in my behavior and offer behavior tweaks (use with a grain of salt‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just one tool).



**Step 4: Define what you want in a partner**

Do a journaling session where you think about what you actually want in a long-term partner.¬† Don‚Äôt be outrageously ambitious, but list out key **dealbreakers** that you think a partner possessing would make it borderline impossible to have a fulfilling life with them.¬† Also list out **preferences,** which are things you think you‚Äôd like more, but you‚Äôll be flexible on.¬† You should limit physical dealbreakers you have as much as possible, because when looking for a long-term relationship, as long as you‚Äôre reasonably attracted to them (like I say below, 7/10), the rest of the stuff matters so much more.

* *My dealbreakers:* politically aligned (enough), emotionally available, a 7/10 attractive (to me), religiously aligned (enough), has friends and interests, employed or on track to be, 21+, fun to banter with
* *My preferences:* shorter than me, ambiverted, sexually adventurous, good sense of humor, open to experience



**Step 5: Ask yourself: ‚Äúwould my ideal partner likely be attracted to current me?‚Äù**

If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôd bet the answer is no.¬† That‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow, but it‚Äôs also low key freeing.¬† It makes you realize, ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm exerting so much energy to try to find a partner who there‚Äôs such a low probability would be interested in me.¬† I wonder what kind of person I could become if I let go of that goal for now and focused on myself?‚Äù

As we move forward, we‚Äôre going to work towards building the person who is attractive to that ideal partner.



**Step 6: Understand your anxieties, insecurities, disruptive patterns, & unmet wants**

If you did a good job of defining your ideal partner, then that partner will be in alignment into someone who‚Äôd desire a better version of you that you can realistically become.¬† So, to determine what goals you need to work on to become attractive to them, you need to understand what key issues you feel you‚Äôre facing in life, and address them!¬† Again, I‚Äôll continue using examples from my journey.

* *Anxieties (what I worry about)*: I struggle with OCD and reassurance seeking, I worry about money due to a lack of emergency fund.
* *Insecurities (where I don‚Äôt feel good enough):* I have a BMI of 41.¬† I have anxious attachment style.¬† I drive a car old enough to smoke.
* *Disruptive Patterns (things that distract me):* I‚Äôm obsessed with the pursuit of a relationship and watch way too much dating content.¬† I‚Äôm addicted to my phone.¬† I struggle to focus, even on things I enjoy.¬†
* *Wants (what I desire but don‚Äôt have):* my friends moved away after college‚Ä¶ I want to rebuild my social circle.¬† I like my career path, but I feel like the ambition that defined me at a younger age has faded too much and would feel proud if I achieved more.



**Step 7: Create a ‚ÄúDating Baseline.‚Äù¬† Stop intentionally dating until you reach it.**¬†

By intentional dating, I mean the following: using dating apps, going out at night just to meet someone, doing any form of ‚Äúcold approach.‚Äù¬† If something happens naturally to you, all the better, just don‚Äôt *seek* it.

For building this dating baseline, I took my step 6 realizations, I listed what would address them in an ideal manor.¬† BMI of 22.5, 6 months emergency fund, make 10 new friends, earn 3 promotions, average 30 minutes meditation daily, average less than 2 hours screen time daily, journal daily, own a new car.



**Step 8: Cut your dating baseline to a more realistic version**

Those goals I just listed‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre pretty ambitious and would take several years to reach.¬† That would burn me out even worse.¬† So what I did is cut them down to ‚Äúacceptable versions.‚Äù¬† I‚Äôll keep working to the ideal versions long-term, but hitting the acceptable ones will queue me to get back on the apps with premium accounts, and start putting myself back out there irl.

My ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù baseline: BMI of 30, 3 new friends, 1 promotion, 10 minutes meditation daily, less than 4 hours screen time daily, journal most days, 4 months emergency fund, own a used car made 2017 or later.



**Step 9: Turn them into S.M.A.R.T. Goals**

Specific (clearly defined), Measurable (has metrics to track progress), Achievable (reasonable to do), Relevant (aligned to your goals - we‚Äôve done this already!), Time-bound (has a deadline).¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs my examples:

* I will reach a BMI of 30 by 4/1/2026.¬† I will weigh in weekly with a goal of 1.5 lbs of weight loss on average / week.
* I will reach $10,000 in savings by 1/1/2026.¬† I will log my purchases on my budget bi-weekly, and aim to add $350 / paycheck to the emergency fund.
* I will make 3 new friends in my city by 1/1/2026.
* I will get promoted by 12/1/2025.¬† I will check in with my on my progress quarterly.
* I will average 10 minutes of daily meditation by 7/1/2025.¬† I will log my meditation daily and note trends in my weekly journal review.
* I will average less than 4 hours on my phone daily by 9/1/2025.¬† I will log my screen time daily and reflect on trends in my weekly review.
* I will own a used car made 2017 or later by 3/1/2026. I will add $180 / paycheck to my down payment fund, and begin researching new cars once that reaches $3,000.



**Step 10: Convert the goals into habits**

A lot of the ideas from this are jacked from Atomic Habits, so give that book a read if you haven‚Äôt!¬† To continue with my example:

* Eat 3 healthy meals / day and limit myself to 2 snacks / day
* Walk 15K steps / day
* Lift weights 3x / week
* Update my budget weekly
* Go to one new social event weekly
* Study 3x / week for the designation that would assist in getting my promotion
* Meditate 10 minutes / day
* Limit to 4 hours screen time on my phone



**Step 11: Simplify the habit to it‚Äôs lowest meaningful action**

I‚Äôve found in the past the biggest obstacle to building behavior change is wanting to go too fast too soon.¬† So, moderate these habits down to something actually doable.¬† Not something so little that it feels unmeaningful, but the smallest amount of work you can where it feels like you‚Äôre exerting yourself more than you‚Äôre used to.¬† To continue my example:

* Eat 2 healthy meals / day and limit to 4 snacks / day
* Walk 7K steps / day
* Watch a video on proper weight lifting form
* Update my budget monthly
* Go to one new social event monthly
* Study once weekly for the designation
* Meditate 5 minutes 5 times this week
* Simply track phone screen time



**Step 12: Adjust the ‚ÄúT‚Äù of S.M.A.R.T. Goals to reflect sustainable change pace**

Again, a lack of patience and this urgency to hit my goals (especially when accompanied by something like limiting dating until I reach them) has a tendency to lead to burn out.¬† So, work towards patience on the goals by making them have a longer time horizon.

* I will reach a BMI of 30 by 10/10/2026.¬† I will weigh in weekly with a goal of 1 lbs of weight loss on average / week.
* I will reach $10,000 in savings by 7/24/2026.¬† I will log my purchases on my budget bi-weekly, and aim to add $250 / paycheck to the emergency fund.
* I will make 3 new friends in my city by 6/1/2026.
* I will get promoted by 12/1/2026.¬† I will check in with my on my progress quarterly.¬† I expect I may actually get this sooner, but if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be patient!
* I will average 10 minutes of daily meditation by 9/1/2025.¬† I will log my meditation daily and note trends in my weekly journal review.
* I will average less than 4 hours on my phone daily by 11/1/2025.¬† I will log my screen time daily and reflect on trends in my weekly review.
* I will own a used car made 2017 or later by 6/1/2026. I will add $120 / paycheck to my down payment fund, and begin researching new cars once that reaches $3,000.



**Step 13: Build a daily habit tracker**

I use Notion for this, because that‚Äôs where I journal, but Google Sheets would be fine too.

Columns: days of the week (then a score one at the end, and a column called ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù)

Rows: the habits

Bonus: list out overambitious goals that might distract you to avoid tracking. For example, I don‚Äôt want to waste any energy or discipline: doing no fap, quitting video games, trying to get sick at chess, trying to run a 10K, trying to be a music blogger, etc‚Ä¶¬† all these things might sounds good on paper, but you only have the bandwidth to change so much about yourself at one time.¬† Focus on the meaningful habits that build towards the goals you actually care about, not the distracting but flashy ones that come up.¬† Unlike what the manosphere will tell you, you‚Äôre allowed to indulge in some stuff on occasion, just also be doing the hard work in other moments.



**Step 14: Level up habits gradually**

With the score column, if you hit the target habit the vast majority of the week (5/7), then you‚Äôre ready to add difficulty to it, by progressively overloading.¬†

Walk 7K steps / day ‚Üí Walk 8K steps / day (week 2) ‚Üí Walk 9K steps / day (week 3), etc‚Ä¶

Meditate 5 minutes 5 times / week ‚Üí Meditate 6 minutes 5 times / week (week 2)

If you didn‚Äôt hit your target habits 5 days or more, don‚Äôt get discouraged, just get back at it next week.¬† Also, don‚Äôt level yourself down on a habit unless you‚Äôve missed it 3 consecutive weeks.¬† We don‚Äôt want to give up that leveling up unless it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs been broken.



**Step 15: Update your journal w/ prompts more tailored to your goals**

The baseline journal prompt is good for getting to know yourself better, but once you do, you need to go deeper into the struggles you face.¬† Some prompts I added:

* Did I avoid any risk out of fear or perfectionism?
* Did my OCD ruminations spiral or amplify today?¬† How did I disengage?
* What uncertainty did I let myself sit in today?
* What was my relationship with food like today?
* Was I physically active today?
* Did I spend money mindfully today?
* When I did I feel present and unpresent today?
* How was my phone use today?¬† Did I feel in control or pulled in by it?
* What‚Äôs one good connection I had today?
* What‚Äôs one way I was compassionate to myself today?

Again, Chat GPT is a great resources for creating prompts tailored to you specifically (use with discretion)



**Step 16: Introduce meditation on patience**

It‚Äôs going to take a while to reach these goals.¬† 18 months for me.¬† Maybe less or longer for you.¬† So learn to be patient.¬† I‚Äôm not an expert on meditation, but just going on youtube and searching X minute meditation on patience has yielded good results for me.



**Step 17: Disconnect from dating content**

During this period of not initially dating, watching lots of dating content will trigger that desire to go seek out a relationship again, so it‚Äôs best to avoid.¬† Even romantic dramas or rom coms can do you this to an extent, so just be vigilant when engaging in those.



**Step 18: Reflect on your progress regularly**

I recommended a weekly journal review, and a monthly journal review process to see where you‚Äôre at with your goals.¬† Set benchmarks for where you‚Äôll want to be at the with the goal next month, and if you‚Äôre not, try to meditate on why, and consider strategies you can use to get back on track.¬† You can then extend the ‚ÄúT‚Äù of your goals a bit, if you feel you‚Äôve felt so far behind that you‚Äôre not on track. ¬† But hopefully, you‚Äôve already set it with long enough horizon that there‚Äôs some in built room for slipping up.



**Step 19: Introduce more organic social opportunities into your life**

Important in getting away from over urgent pursuit of relationships and healing anxious attachment is forming steady community in your life.¬† Go to meetups, join that sports league you‚Äôre interested in, get involved in a local discord, etc‚Ä¶ This will make eventually reintegrating dating back into your life a lot easier (and may even lead to an organic dating opportunity before you reach your baseline!)



**Step 20: Hit your baseline**

You‚Äôll eventually reach your goals!¬† When you do, take some time to celebrate.¬† Do something big, like go on a weekend trip to another city, indulge in your favorite meals, etc‚Ä¶¬† I find a lot of goal oriented people really struggle to savor accomplishment.¬† You‚Äôll hit a goal, and be on to chasing the next, and other than one euphoric moment‚Ä¶ you never feel satisfied.¬† Don‚Äôt do that when you hit this baseline.¬† Go all out and really appreciate the commitment you put into you!



**Step 21: Reintegrate dating & cast a wide net**

You‚Äôre now ready to date, so go for it!¬† From a place of more security, you‚Äôll know your value and come at things from more of a buyer's mindset than a beggars.¬†

As for actually getting the dates, there‚Äôs lot of options.¬† Get on the dating apps (especially Hinge & Bumble).¬† Invest in premium accounts, as you can use them more intentionally and set more preferences to find people you‚Äôre actually interested in.¬† Invest in high quality photos of yourself.¬† View it all as an investment into find a quality partner.

Go to more social events like I said earlier.¬† Logan Ury, whose book How Not To Die Alone is a great read at this stage of the process (but not before), has a matrix she uses on events that‚Äôs really helpful.¬† On one axis is ‚Äúevents you‚Äôd like‚Äù on the other is ‚Äúevents where you‚Äôd likely meet someone you like‚Äù... pick events in the top right corner (that you‚Äôll enjoy and meet people you‚Äôll enjoy).

Don‚Äôt be afraid to be brave in public on occasion.¬† See a really your type person at a coffee shop, go start a conversation (don‚Äôt ‚Äúhit on them‚Äù, just talk like an adult and flirt a bit).¬† A great line to ask someone out is just ‚ÄúI really enjoyed this conversation, would you like to continue it over drinks sometime?‚Äù¬†¬†



**Step 22: Maintain your dealbreakers, flexibilize on your preferences**

Be intentional about not settling for someone you know won‚Äôt be compatible with you long-term.¬† If she‚Äôs a Christian right winger, and you‚Äôre a socialist atheist‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care how good the sex is, it‚Äôs not going to work.¬† Date with long-term compatibility in mind, not focused on how much of a ‚Äúspark‚Äù you have.¬†¬†

However, don‚Äôt be rigid on your preferences.¬† If you‚Äôre a woman who prefers dating someone 4‚Äô taller than you, don‚Äôt filter out all guys who don‚Äôt meet that on dating apps.¬† Their might be a guy out there who aligns perfectly with you religiously, & politically, is really fun to talk to, is really attractive, and is emotionally mature that you‚Äôre missing out on because you think a preference is a dealbreaker.¬†¬†



**Step 23: Be intentional (externally & internally) in the relationship**¬†

Once you actually get in a relationship, communicate well with your partner.¬† Don‚Äôt become complacent and let go of your goals just because forming a relationship was the main reason you started down this path.¬† Hopefully, you‚Äôll have rediscovered that lust for life that was missing when obsessed with dating.¬† With that in mind, if the relationship gets toxic, don‚Äôt be afraid to leave it.¬† Again, you now have a buyer‚Äôs mindset, and you don‚Äôt have to take a whole bunch of shit just out of fear of being alone‚Ä¶ because you‚Äôre a catch and have options.

Maybe others have had the same experience I‚Äôve had. 

I have a Vertuo line machine:  a Nespresso pop+ limited edition model in the black and gold color. I received it in September or October of 2024, so it hasn‚Äôt even been a year yet. I‚Äôve only used 12 coffee pods in it the entire time I‚Äôve had it. Use the cleaning rinse function once per month anyway. 

I‚Äôm ‚Äúnew‚Äù to Nespresso, but this isn‚Äôt the first Nespresso machine I‚Äôve used. I‚Äôve been using a Nespresso pop+ machine since 2023. This is just my first time owning one myself. 

My machine works as intended except for the descaling feature. Today was the first day I tried to use it, using the tutorials on Nespresso‚Äôs YouTube channel. I even called their customer service and had someone there help me via a video call. 

Error messages galore. Complete frustrating. 

They don‚Äôt make my specific machine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúlimited edition,‚Äù so she offered to send me a deluxe version. I declined, because truth be told, I‚Äôm not a fan of the Nespresso pop line. I also want the color I have, not something else. I‚Äôm also concerned the next machine will have problems. 

I asked her if I can get this repaired at a Nespresso boutique in a city near me. She said I‚Äôd have to mail the machine in if I want a repair. Luckily, they will repair it for free. The plan is for me to do that, but I may cancel and simply use this unit until it dies via a work around. 

The ‚Äúwork around‚Äù I‚Äôm using is using the rinse/cleaning mode two times until all my solution in the tank is gone. Then, I use cleaning mode two more times to make sure there are no more remnants of solution left in the machine. The customer service rep said that this manner will not work long-term, and eventually I will need to descale properly. 

The customer service rep was nice and patient with me, as I was very frustrated over the phone. I thanked her for her kindness. 

Won‚Äôt be doing this again though. Might not even bother with the repair. I use Nespresso‚Äôs Gold instant coffee line, I use a different machine at work (which is when I usually drink coffee. I rarely drink coffee at home, and I prefer teas), and I buy my coffee out when I don‚Äôt feel like making it and want something that tastes better than any concoction I make at home. I will survive without a nespresso machine. 

If I do go the Nespresso route again, I will get the original line Citrix machine, or I‚Äôll get a Vertuo plus model. The Next and the Pop, both extremely popular, are very problematic. ",1,1748712418.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Does exceeding forty two grams net a more intense experience? Or is there a 'diminishing returns' once the dose exceeds forty two grams? 

Thank you for your responses.

I want to thank you in advance if you read this, this group has saved me and given me much needed guidance. 

I have NOT had dairy or meat in 7 years. I eat a decently healthy vegetarian diet (no dairy, no  meat but I eat eggs)

The ER doctor said do liquids for a day or two. Dont eat any burgers or anything heavy for a week. I said I dont eat meat or dairy already. He said I'll be fine.  (I'm in canada) ER was very overwhelmed.


It was going great until my 3rd week, I was having amazing stools and was feeling better but lacked energy. Then the third week after earing badly for a day or two then I had narrow poops and could feel my lower sigmoid hurting ( nothing compared to before to er)  so here I am.


So I started off with clear liquids (broths and water) 
Then I transitioned into dairy free yogurt, skinned potatoes and tomato soup.

 on my 5th day or so I started to eat eggs, potatoes with skin, dairy free yogurt, rice, banana, apple sauce.
 1.5 weeks in I was having one coffee a day.

Two weeks in I was eating all of this then I had stir fry  (green beans, water crests, carrots, mushrooms and sugar snap peas) with soy sauce. I had oranges the one day, I stupidly ate samosas (vegetable and potato) with my wife when we had come home late and I needed to eat quick  ( I didnt want to write it as I know it was not smart of me)

Also pierogies with potato and onion in them)

My GAME PLAN to restart the process as described in the wiki in this thread

I was going to do two days of liquid diet (just broths) and non caffeinated teas with cashew milk (no oil in milk)

Then I was going to move into low residue foods (seems to be conflicting opinions on this) 

- non dairy yogurt with non dairy milk (I currently have been eating this every day)
-eggss
-white bread
- blended to a liquid (finished in ninja creami) glass of cashew milk, spoon of smooth peanut butter, coco powder and ice all blended to a pulp)
- apple sauce (apple only ingredient) 
-teas

Any suggestions welcome for a low residue diet. Dont eat dairy or meat. 

Before I switch to eating beyond a low residue diet I will make a new post or edit this one.

1l02gfv,https://i.redd.it/yp7bema0j54f1.jpeg,Updated Aileen Wuornos,"Preface: They labeled Aileen America‚Äôs first female serial killer though she was neither the first or the worst. Though she did have a ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù approach to homicide most would say. She is suspected of at least seven murders and sentenced to die in four out six of those cases that she confessed to police. She did insist that some, if not all were done in self defense, resisting violent assaults from men she solicited while working as a sex worker. Though, only one case was shown where her story may have been true.¬†
¬†
Aileen was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan on February 29, 1956. Her teenage parents separated months before she was born. Her father Leo Pittman moving on to serve time in Kansas and Michigan as a deranged child molester. He committed suicide by hanging himself in prison. Her mother Diane Pratt recalls Aileen and her brother as ‚Äúcrying, unhappy babies‚Äù, and that caused her to abandon them with her parents in 1960. On March 18, 1960 Aileen‚Äôs maternal grandparents Lauri and Britta Wuornos legally adopted the children. 
¬†
Aileen‚Äôs childhood showed little to no improvements there. By six she had suffered scarring burns to her face when she and her brother were setting fires with lighter fluid. Aileen later disclosed to police she slept with her brother at a young age but friends say otherwise and he is unable to speak for himself as he passed in 1976. Aileen at this point though was being sexually abused by her grandfather and at least one of his adult friends. By 11 she was prostituting herself out at school to students for drugs, cigarettes, and food. She had her only child, a son, at 14 years old at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971. She gave him away in a closed adoption. It's said that the father of the child was one of her Grandpas friends, though everyone blamed Aileen. On July 7, 1971 her grandmother died, although it was suspected to be liver failure Diane believed it to be her father of murder. Diane claimed her father threatened to kill her and her kids if they weren‚Äôt removed from his home.
¬†
Aileen and her brother at that point became wards of the court. Aileen dropped out of school to work the streets full time as a teenage sex worker drifting across country. In May 1974 Aileen was using the alias ‚ÄúSandra Kretsch‚Äù she was jailed in Jefferson County, Colorado for disorderly conduct, drunk driving, and firing a .22 caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. Additional charges were added for failure to appear. Back in Michigan on July 13, 1976 Aileen was arrested in Antrim County for simple assault and disturbing the peace after throwing a cue ball at a bartenders head. She also had outstanding warrants in Troy, Michigan for driving without a license and consuming alcohol in a motor vehicle. On August 4, 1976 Aileen settled her debt of $105 to society.

The money came indirectly from her brothers death on July 17, 1976¬† his death left her with a life insurance payment of $10,000. Of which Aileen wasted in two months on luxuries. One of which was a new car she wrecked pretty quickly. Finding herself broke again nearing late September she hitchhiked a ride to Florida. It may have been a change of scenery but she was still Aileen and the law was still the law.
¬†
Once in Florida she met Lewis Gratz Fell, a 69 year old yacht club president. They fell in love and quickly got married, you can find their marriage announcement in the archives of the local paper. Aileen despite married life would continually involve herself in confrontations at their local bar and went to jail briefly for assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading him to gain a restraining order against her within weeks of the marriage. 

On May 20, 1981 Aileen was arrested in Edgewater, Florida for armed robbery of a convenience store. Aileen was sentenced to prison time for this on May 4, 1982, being released 13 months later on June 30, 1983. Her next arrest on May 1, 1984 was for trying to pass forged checks at a bank. On November 30, 1985 she was named as a suspect in the theft of a postal and ammunition in Pasco County. She used the alias ‚ÄúLori Grody‚Äù from an aunt in Michigan. 11 days later Florida Highway Patrol cited Aileen (posing as Grody) for driving without a valid license. On January 4, 1986 Aileen was arrested in Miami as Aileen, for auto theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction with false information. The police found a .38 caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986 Volusia County detained Aileen posing as Grody for questioning after a male friend of hers accused her of pulling a gun on him and demanding $200. Despite her refusal of the situation Aileen was carrying spare ammunition and a .22 pistol was hidden under the seat she was in in the car. Aileen created a new alias ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù she was ticketed for speeding in Jefferson County, Florida. Her citation included ‚ÄúAttitude poor. Thinks she‚Äôs above the law.‚Äù.
¬†
This is when Tyria Moore met Aileen in a gay bar in Daytona. This would be Aileen's second relationship with a woman but not a lot is known about the first relationship. The bar that they met at is still open today. They quickly became lovers but the passion faded over a year, they remained friends and traveling companions. They became inseparable over the next four years. On July 4, 1987 police detained ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù and ‚ÄúTina Moore‚Äù for questioning on suspicion of hitting a man with a beer bottle. ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù (Aileen) was alone with a patrolman cited her for walking on the interstate and possessing a suspended license on December 18, 1987. Once again her citation read ‚Äúattitude poor‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù proved it over two months with threatening letters letters mailed to the circuit clerk on January 11 and February 9, 1988.
¬†
A month later Aileen had a new approach and alias. On March 12, 1988 ‚ÄúCammie Marsh Greene‚Äù accused a Daytona bus driver of attacking her, claiming he pushed her off the bus following an argument. Tyria Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. On July 23, 1988 a Daytona landlord accused Moore and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù of vandalizing their apartment, ripping out carpets, and painting the walls dark brown without approval. In November 1988 ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù made a six day attack of threatening calls against a Zephyrhills market, over an incident with lottery tickets.
¬†
By 1989 Aileen was just belligerent and erratic. She never took an insult lightly, she would go out of her way to provoke arguments, and always had a loaded pistol in her purse. She would hang out at bars and truck stops, hitchhiking rides to snag a sex work deal when all else failed. So she used theft to supplement her sex work income. More and more with Tyria she talked about all the wrongs in her life and wanting revenge.
¬†
Richard Malloy, victim one. A 51 year old electrician from Palm Harbor. He was last seen alive by coworkers on November 30, 1989. He had picked up Aileen on interstate 75 in Florida to have sex for money. His car was found abandoned at Ormond Beach the next day, his wallet and papers nearby, several condoms, and a half bottle of vodka. On December 13, 1989 his fully dressed corpse was found in the woods north of Daytona shot three times with a .22 pistol in the chest. In searching for a motive police discovered he‚Äôd been divorced five times, and had the reputation of being paranoid, a heavy drinker, and very much into the porno/topless bar scene. He had no criminal record though despite being described as mental. During the investigation they found items belonging to Mallory at a local pawnshop with a receipt showing Aileens thumbprint. Police were able to link other stolen items from Mallory to Aileen like a camera from his car was found inside a rented storage unit with a key taken from Aileen and other items traced back to local pawnshops or people that she had contacted.

The investigation stalled on June 1, 1990 when a nude victim was found, shot six times with a .22 in the torso, and dumped in the woods 40 miles north of Tampa. By June 7, the corpse had been identified by dental records as 43 year old David Spears, last seen leaving his job in Sarasota on May 19. Spears planned on visiting his ex in Orlando that afternoon but he didn‚Äôt make up. His boss saw his missing pick up on May 25, but then the trail went cold.
¬†
By the time Spears was identified the third victim had shown up. Charles Carskaddon, 40, was a part time rodeo worker from Booneville, Missouri, missing since May 31. He vanished along I-75 on his way to meet his fianc√© in Tampa. His naked corpse found 30 miles south of the Spears murder site on June 6. He had been shot nine times with a .22 pistol in the chest and stomach. This suggested a pattern even to those who resisted the idea of a serial killer at large. On June 7 Charles car was found in Marion County, a .45 semiautomatic and personal items were stolen from the car.

Peter Siems, 65, a merchant seaman turned missionary was seen last on June 7, 1990. He left his Jupiter, Florida home to see family in Arkansas. When he never arrived a missing person report was filed on June 22. No trace of him had been found by July 4 when his car was wrecked and abandoned in Orange Springs, Florida. Witnesses described the occupants of the car as two women one blond and one brunette. The blond was injured and bleeding and police were able to life a bloody palm print from the vehicles trunk.

Eugene Burress, 50, left the Ocala sausage factory where he worked to make his delivery rounds on July 30, 1990. A missing person report was filed when he hadn‚Äôt returned by 2am the next day and his delivery van was found two hours later. On august 4 his fully dressed body was found by a family picnicking in the Ocala National Forest. He had been shot twice by a .22 pistol in the back and chest. Nearby police found his credit cards, receipts, and an empty cash bag from a local bank.

Dick Humphreys, 56, was a retired Alabama police chief who had been employed by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to investigate child abuse claims in Ocala. His wife filed a missing person report when he failed to return home from work on the night of September 11, 1990. He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol in his head and torso, his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder.
¬†
Walter Antonio, 60, a trucker from Merritt Island who doubled as police reserve for Brevard County. Found in the woods northwest of Cross City on November 19, 1990,¬† he had been shot three times in the back and once in the head. He was nude but for his socks, his clothes were later found in a remote area near Taylor County. His car was found in Brevard County on November 24. Police said that his killer had stolen a distinctive gold ring along with his badge, nightstick, handcuffs, and flashlight.

By 1990 Tyria had become suspicious if not completely aware of what Aileen was really doing and decided to move in with her family in Pennsylvania. Police would later track her down and use her to elicit a confession from Aileen. Though Aileen told the police once captured that she had given Tyria inconsistent versions about what had happened. In one she told her she had found the dead body hidden under a scrap of rug in the woods and another she had supposedly confessed to the killings. 
¬†
Aileen was arrested on an outstanding warrant at a biker bar in Harbor Oaks, Florida. On January 16, 1991 Aileen summoned detectives and confessed to the six killings, allegedly done in self defense to ward off vicious assaults. Within two weeks of her arrest her attorney had sold the rights to her story for a movie. A bizarre sideshow of media became about this case which is why I left some details out. Aileen's supporters saw her as a strong, independent woman, and almost a hero figure for defending herself against male aggression. 

The Judge, Judge Uriel Blount who handled the case came out of retirement specifically to handle Aileen's case. Aileen stood trial one time as she pled no contest or guilty to the murder charges. Though, in 1992 after being convicted of one of the murders and sentenced to death she plead guilty to three more murders and admitted she had killed for profit, not in self defense. 

Prosecutors based their case mainly on the videotaped confession Aileen gave to police during her interrogation. They were also able to introduce evidence related to her other murder charges based on a Florida law known as the Williams Rule which lets evidence related to collateral crimes to be admitted if it helps to show motive, intent, knowledge, modus operandi, or lack of mistake. They dismissed Aileen's claims that all seven murders happened in self defense pointing out that the story varied with each telling. In her confession you can tell she wasn't as worried about clearing herself as she was clearing Tyria. What she didn't realize was that Tyria had cooperated with the police to convince Aileen that she would be prosecuted unless Aileen cooperated. Many believed Aileen was confident and not upset during her confession she stated ""I took a life...I am willing to give up my life because I killed people...I deserve to die."" 

The defense argued that her taped statements in the confession were obtained involuntarily and in violation of her right to due process. She had been advised of her Miranda Rights and provided with a public defender who advised her not to make any lengthy statements but police exploitation of her relationship with Tyria in obtaining the confession impaired her mental state and level of functioning to the point that she didn't have a rational understanding of her rights and advice of counsel. The trial court rejected this argument and denied the defense motion to suppress the video confession. Though, it had already been leaked to the media so the public's perception of her had already been influenced. 

Against her attorneys wishes she testified at trial and repeated her claim of self defense, but during cross examination became agitated and angry. She invoked her fifth amendment right against self incrimination twenty five times and was the only defense witness. The defense also raised the issue that soon after her arrest three detectives on the case as well as Tyria talked to the media to sell their stories. Some suspected that such details influenced the witnesses to exaggerate their stories to more lucrative offers. As I mentioned earlier the case had a lot of fuckery surrounding the selling of stories and exaggeration of things. The jury found her guilty on all counts including first degree murder and armed robbery after just less than two hours of deliberation. She shouted ""Sons of bitches! I was raped! I hope you get raped. Scumbags of America!"". The defense was trying to portray Aileen as a woman who had lived a horrible life of victimization and violence with little help from anyone and who later would lash out at her victimizers.

The states expert psychologist testified that she suffered from both borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. He agreed with other experts that experienced impaired capacity and mental disturbances at the time of the crime, though he concluded that the impairment wasn't substantial and the disturbance wasn't extreme. He also agreed there was evidence of non-statutory mitigating evidence, like her mental problems, alcoholism, disturbances, and genetic or environment deficits. To show the evidence of her rough upbringing the state called two witnesses, Lori Grody, Aileen's aunt and stepsister and Barry Wuornos, her uncle and stepbrother. Barry stated her grandfather ""laid down rules"" but was someone to look up to. He claimed to have never seen his father beat Aileen but that she was spanked and when she was ten the discipline became more ""tight"".  It's important I think to note that by Junior High before dropping out of school Aileen showed hearing and vision loss as well as her IQ of 81, which is in the low dull normal range. The school officials urged she receive counseling and tried to improve her behavior by giving her a ""mild tranquilizer"". Her defense attorney at one point called her a ""damaged, primitive child"". 

The jury recommended the death sentence by a vote of 12 to 0 concluding that five aggravating circumstances and only one mitigating factor were present in her case. The five aggravating circumstances were:
-she had a previous felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence. 
-murder was committed during the commission of a robbery
-murder was committed in order to avoid arrest
-murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel
-murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated 
The one mitigating factor was that she had suffered from borderline personality disorder. The jury decided that despite her psychological difficulties she knew the difference between right and wrong. Though the judge found these non-statutory mitigators:
-she suffered antisocial and borderline personality disorders
-she may have been physically abused as a child
-her natural father and grandfather committed suicide
-her grandma died an alcoholic
-her mother abandoned her as an infant
The judge followed the jury's recommendation of death and sentenced her to the electric chair on January 31, 1992. 

After the trial Tyria made several book and movie deals, so did three detectives on the case (they resigned from the force). In their defense (if there is one), the officers maintained that they were moved to sell their versions by pure intentions, intending to put the money into a victim fund. They later denounced exposure of their scheme as the malicious work of brother officers, driven by their jealousy at being cut out of the deal. 

In November 1992, a Dateline NBC reporter found out that Mallory had served ten years in prison for a violent rape in another state. This is important because police had previously denied any evidence existed to corroborate Aileen's claims of rape or a history of sexual crimes by Mallory. The judge refused to allow this to be admitted in post trial proceedings and Aileen wasn't ever given a retrial. In February 1993 she pled guilty to the murder of Walter Antonio and was sentenced to death again. During her plea to the court she held to her statement that Mallory raped her, ""I wanted to confess to you that Richard Mallory did violently rape me as I've told you. But these others did not. They only began to start to."". On May 15, 1993 Aileen got three more death sentences. She turned to the assistant states attorney and said ""I hope your wife and children get raped in the ass! Motherfucker!"". 

Aileen tried to argue that her original trial counsel provided ineffective representation. One example of that was revealed in the failure to uncover Mallorys arrest records which would have corroborated her self defense theory. In addition trial counsel failed to call lay mitigation witnesses during the penalty trial who could have testified to Aileen's child abuse claims. Several of her friends and neighbors stated that they would have testified had they been called. In later hearing several of those people testified they were contacted by the media following her arrest but never by the public defenders office. Aileen also argued that she had not been completely effectively evaluated regarding her competency to stand trial. Her erratic behavior just continued to worsen really, she fired several attorneys. Some of those attorneys contacted the Florida Supreme Court to express their concerns that Aileen was not competent to be executed. Aileen also wrote several extensive and rambling motions to the courts in which she claimed prison staff were abusing her. All of her claims were evaluated and rejected by the state and federal appellate courts. 

After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them to expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. 

On September 30, 2002 Governor Jeb Bush granted a Stay of Execution and ordered a mental examination to determine if Aileen was competent to be executed. Florida law mandates that an inmate cannot be executed unless she understands both why she has been sentenced to death and that execution results in death. An examination by three psychiatrists appointed by the state concluded Aileen was competent to be executed and the stay was lifted. Before her execution though an Ohio group called Florida Support, filed a motion on her behalf to stay the execution. They cited her extreme mental illness. Florida allows groups or individuals to file such motions on behalf of defendants as ""next friend"" in capital post conviction proceedings. The motion was denied. 

She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were ‚ÄúYes, I would just like to say I‚Äôm sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.‚Äù. She was the tenth woman to be executed in the United States since 1976 and the second woman ever in Florida.

If you would like to please feel free to check out my other blogs or just feel free to comment what you know about Aileen! Also, if you want a good movie based on Aileen's life I'd say check out the 2003 movie Monster, with Christina Ricci as Tyria. In my opinion it showed the most accurate depiction of events. Trigger warning though, there is a rape scene that is pretty brutal to watch. There's also a really good real life documentary of her while she is in prison that really gives you a good look at who she was, its available on YouTube.

1l02fuc,https://i.redd.it/01dr3i2wi54f1.jpeg,Updated Aileen Wuornos,"Preface: They labeled Aileen America‚Äôs first female serial killer though she was neither the first or the worst. Though she did have a ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù approach to homicide most would say. She is suspected of at least seven murders and sentenced to die in four out six of those cases that she confessed to police. She did insist that some, if not all were done in self defense, resisting violent assaults from men she solicited while working as a sex worker. Though, only one case was shown where her story may have been true.¬†
¬†
Aileen was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan on February 29, 1956. Her teenage parents separated months before she was born. Her father Leo Pittman moving on to serve time in Kansas and Michigan as a deranged child molester. He committed suicide by hanging himself in prison. Her mother Diane Pratt recalls Aileen and her brother as ‚Äúcrying, unhappy babies‚Äù, and that caused her to abandon them with her parents in 1960. On March 18, 1960 Aileen‚Äôs maternal grandparents Lauri and Britta Wuornos legally adopted the children. 
¬†
Aileen‚Äôs childhood showed little to no improvements there. By six she had suffered scarring burns to her face when she and her brother were setting fires with lighter fluid. Aileen later disclosed to police she slept with her brother at a young age but friends say otherwise and he is unable to speak for himself as he passed in 1976. Aileen at this point though was being sexually abused by her grandfather and at least one of his adult friends. By 11 she was prostituting herself out at school to students for drugs, cigarettes, and food. She had her only child, a son, at 14 years old at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971. She gave him away in a closed adoption. It's said that the father of the child was one of her Grandpas friends, though everyone blamed Aileen. On July 7, 1971 her grandmother died, although it was suspected to be liver failure Diane believed it to be her father of murder. Diane claimed her father threatened to kill her and her kids if they weren‚Äôt removed from his home.
¬†
Aileen and her brother at that point became wards of the court. Aileen dropped out of school to work the streets full time as a teenage sex worker drifting across country. In May 1974 Aileen was using the alias ‚ÄúSandra Kretsch‚Äù she was jailed in Jefferson County, Colorado for disorderly conduct, drunk driving, and firing a .22 caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. Additional charges were added for failure to appear. Back in Michigan on July 13, 1976 Aileen was arrested in Antrim County for simple assault and disturbing the peace after throwing a cue ball at a bartenders head. She also had outstanding warrants in Troy, Michigan for driving without a license and consuming alcohol in a motor vehicle. On August 4, 1976 Aileen settled her debt of $105 to society.

The money came indirectly from her brothers death on July 17, 1976¬† his death left her with a life insurance payment of $10,000. Of which Aileen wasted in two months on luxuries. One of which was a new car she wrecked pretty quickly. Finding herself broke again nearing late September she hitchhiked a ride to Florida. It may have been a change of scenery but she was still Aileen and the law was still the law.
¬†
Once in Florida she met Lewis Gratz Fell, a 69 year old yacht club president. They fell in love and quickly got married, you can find their marriage announcement in the archives of the local paper. Aileen despite married life would continually involve herself in confrontations at their local bar and went to jail briefly for assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading him to gain a restraining order against her within weeks of the marriage. 

On May 20, 1981 Aileen was arrested in Edgewater, Florida for armed robbery of a convenience store. Aileen was sentenced to prison time for this on May 4, 1982, being released 13 months later on June 30, 1983. Her next arrest on May 1, 1984 was for trying to pass forged checks at a bank. On November 30, 1985 she was named as a suspect in the theft of a postal and ammunition in Pasco County. She used the alias ‚ÄúLori Grody‚Äù from an aunt in Michigan. 11 days later Florida Highway Patrol cited Aileen (posing as Grody) for driving without a valid license. On January 4, 1986 Aileen was arrested in Miami as Aileen, for auto theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction with false information. The police found a .38 caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986 Volusia County detained Aileen posing as Grody for questioning after a male friend of hers accused her of pulling a gun on him and demanding $200. Despite her refusal of the situation Aileen was carrying spare ammunition and a .22 pistol was hidden under the seat she was in in the car. Aileen created a new alias ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù she was ticketed for speeding in Jefferson County, Florida. Her citation included ‚ÄúAttitude poor. Thinks she‚Äôs above the law.‚Äù.
¬†
This is when Tyria Moore met Aileen in a gay bar in Daytona. This would be Aileen's second relationship with a woman but not a lot is known about the first relationship. The bar that they met at is still open today. They quickly became lovers but the passion faded over a year, they remained friends and traveling companions. They became inseparable over the next four years. On July 4, 1987 police detained ‚ÄúSusan Blahovec‚Äù and ‚ÄúTina Moore‚Äù for questioning on suspicion of hitting a man with a beer bottle. ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù (Aileen) was alone with a patrolman cited her for walking on the interstate and possessing a suspended license on December 18, 1987. Once again her citation read ‚Äúattitude poor‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù proved it over two months with threatening letters letters mailed to the circuit clerk on January 11 and February 9, 1988.
¬†
A month later Aileen had a new approach and alias. On March 12, 1988 ‚ÄúCammie Marsh Greene‚Äù accused a Daytona bus driver of attacking her, claiming he pushed her off the bus following an argument. Tyria Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. On July 23, 1988 a Daytona landlord accused Moore and ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù of vandalizing their apartment, ripping out carpets, and painting the walls dark brown without approval. In November 1988 ‚ÄúBlahovec‚Äù made a six day attack of threatening calls against a Zephyrhills market, over an incident with lottery tickets.
¬†
By 1989 Aileen was just belligerent and erratic. She never took an insult lightly, she would go out of her way to provoke arguments, and always had a loaded pistol in her purse. She would hang out at bars and truck stops, hitchhiking rides to snag a sex work deal when all else failed. So she used theft to supplement her sex work income. More and more with Tyria she talked about all the wrongs in her life and wanting revenge.
¬†
Richard Malloy, victim one. A 51 year old electrician from Palm Harbor. He was last seen alive by coworkers on November 30, 1989. He had picked up Aileen on interstate 75 in Florida to have sex for money. His car was found abandoned at Ormond Beach the next day, his wallet and papers nearby, several condoms, and a half bottle of vodka. On December 13, 1989 his fully dressed corpse was found in the woods north of Daytona shot three times with a .22 pistol in the chest. In searching for a motive police discovered he‚Äôd been divorced five times, and had the reputation of being paranoid, a heavy drinker, and very much into the porno/topless bar scene. He had no criminal record though despite being described as mental. During the investigation they found items belonging to Mallory at a local pawnshop with a receipt showing Aileens thumbprint. Police were able to link other stolen items from Mallory to Aileen like a camera from his car was found inside a rented storage unit with a key taken from Aileen and other items traced back to local pawnshops or people that she had contacted. 
¬†
The investigation stalled on June 1, 1990 when a nude victim was found, shot six times with a .22 in the torso, and dumped in the woods 40 miles north of Tampa. By June 7, the corpse had been identified by dental records as 43 year old David Spears, last seen leaving his job in Sarasota on May 19.

He was found the next day in an undeveloped subdivision, shot seven times with a .22 pistol in his head and torso, his pants pockets turned inside out. On September 19 his car was found abandoned and stripped of plates behind a service station in Live Oak. It was impounded on September 25 and not traced back to Humphreys until October 13, the same day his badge and other belongings were found in Lake County, 70 miles southeast of the murder.

-she had a previous felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence. 
-murder was committed during the commission of a robbery
-murder was committed in order to avoid arrest
-murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel
-murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated 
The one mitigating factor was that she had suffered from borderline personality disorder. The jury decided that despite her psychological difficulties she knew the difference between right and wrong. Though the judge found these non-statutory mitigators:
-she suffered antisocial and borderline personality disorders
-she may have been physically abused as a child
-her natural father and grandfather committed suicide
-her grandma died an alcoholic
-her mother abandoned her as an infant
The judge followed the jury's recommendation of death and sentenced her to the electric chair on January 31, 1992. 

After the trial Tyria made several book and movie deals, so did three detectives on the case (they resigned from the force). In their defense (if there is one), the officers maintained that they were moved to sell their versions by pure intentions, intending to put the money into a victim fund. They later denounced exposure of their scheme as the malicious work of brother officers, driven by their jealousy at being cut out of the deal. 

In November 1992, a Dateline NBC reporter found out that Mallory had served ten years in prison for a violent rape in another state. This is important because police had previously denied any evidence existed to corroborate Aileen's claims of rape or a history of sexual crimes by Mallory. The judge refused to allow this to be admitted in post trial proceedings and Aileen wasn't ever given a retrial. In February 1993 she pled guilty to the murder of Walter Antonio and was sentenced to death again. During her plea to the court she held to her statement that Mallory raped her, ""I wanted to confess to you that Richard Mallory did violently rape me as I've told you. But these others did not. They only began to start to."". On May 15, 1993 Aileen got three more death sentences. She turned to the assistant states attorney and said ""I hope your wife and children get raped in the ass! Motherfucker!"". 

Aileen tried to argue that her original trial counsel provided ineffective representation. One example of that was revealed in the failure to uncover Mallorys arrest records which would have corroborated her self defense theory. In addition trial counsel failed to call lay mitigation witnesses during the penalty trial who could have testified to Aileen's child abuse claims. Several of her friends and neighbors stated that they would have testified had they been called. In later hearing several of those people testified they were contacted by the media following her arrest but never by the public defenders office. Aileen also argued that she had not been completely effectively evaluated regarding her competency to stand trial. Her erratic behavior just continued to worsen really, she fired several attorneys. Some of those attorneys contacted the Florida Supreme Court to express their concerns that Aileen was not competent to be executed. Aileen also wrote several extensive and rambling motions to the courts in which she claimed prison staff were abusing her. All of her claims were evaluated and rejected by the state and federal appellate courts. 

After nine years on death row Aileen stopped all her appeals. In April 2001 she asked them to expedite her process on death row. Even in one interview recanting her self defense approach to the case. The state Supreme Court approved her decision to fire her attorneys on April 1, 2002. 

On September 30, 2002 Governor Jeb Bush granted a Stay of Execution and ordered a mental examination to determine if Aileen was competent to be executed. Florida law mandates that an inmate cannot be executed unless she understands both why she has been sentenced to death and that execution results in death. An examination by three psychiatrists appointed by the state concluded Aileen was competent to be executed and the stay was lifted. Before her execution though an Ohio group called Florida Support, filed a motion on her behalf to stay the execution. They cited her extreme mental illness. Florida allows groups or individuals to file such motions on behalf of defendants as ""next friend"" in capital post conviction proceedings. The motion was denied. 

She was executed by lethal injection six months later on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal, only asking for a cup of coffee. Her last words were ‚ÄúYes, I would just like to say I‚Äôm sailing with the rock, and ill be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.‚Äù. She was the tenth woman to be executed in the United States since 1976 and the second woman ever in Florida.

If you would like to please feel free to check out my other blogs or just feel free to comment what you know about Aileen! Also, if you want a good movie based on Aileen's life I'd say check out the 2003 movie Monster, with Christina Ricci as Tyria. In my opinion it showed the most accurate depiction of events. Trigger warning though, there is a rape scene that is pretty brutal to watch. There's also a really good real life documentary of her while she is in prison that really gives you a good look at who she was, its available on YouTube.

Later, I found out that she was running a hotel to redeem Sinners and send them to Heaven, and one of her clients was Anthony, now going by ""Angel Dust."" I also heard of the Exterminations, and was horrified that Heaven could do such a thing. Fortunately, they where soon put to an end, and a Demon named ""Sir Pentius"" made it to Heaven.

(he has all my social accounts and everything, i barely talk to anyone outside of work.) he got mad that i was defending my coworker bc i said ‚Äúi think he‚Äôs just being nice?‚Äù and i genuinely didn‚Äôt think the red hearts meant anything. i wanted to think my bf is a good man. he makes his money, he has a nice car, he has no reason to feel threatened by my retail store coworker. we made up the same day of my birthday- but it wasn‚Äôt the same. i couldn‚Äôt get my hair done like i wanted or wear what i wanted because we wasted a lot of time fighting and i had to ask him to wear a pair of jeans to dinner because he showed up in sweatpants. 

all the incidents - 

winter break he went on a boys trip. there was a girl who was hanging around their group. i wasn‚Äôt fond of this but i let it go and just lived with it. there was an instance where she was being followed by men around the resort so she texted my bf to walk her to her room; to be fair ive always told him if there is a girl who is in trouble don‚Äôt ever hesitate to help her. he comes back from the trip and everything was fine in terms of that situation but we argued a lot more about other things. i was going through a lot, struggling with my body and feeling ‚Äúwomanly‚Äù. 

when i told him i don‚Äôt feel so girly and im struggling a bit to initiate sex bc of my confidence he initially said that‚Äôs something i would need to figure out on my own, and has nothing to do with him. during this argument he followed a model on instagram and during calls back and forth (because he keeps hanging up on me- when for years ive asked him not to do it) and he said he‚Äôs not sexually attracted to me anymore. we solved the argument and he said he meant that he feels i don‚Äôt initiate and i was like well i was tryna tell you why lmao but you kinda blew up. but we solved it i guess. i just still feel those words ringing. 

then i started having some gut feeling; he‚Äôs had all my socials for years but ive never had his. so i faught and got his instagram (after he had been putting it off saying he needs to reset the pass / doesn‚Äôt rmr) and then my world slowly collapsed week by week. first incident, i went on the girls instagram (from the winter break trip) and there was a photo of just them two together, her head slightly leaning on his shoulder. seeing them touching just irked me. second incident, i saw a few workout posts of girls‚Äô glute exercises in his saved folder. which he said he saved in retaliation to me saving some male workout videos. i had 2 saved in a whole folder; one was clearly educational, one the man was fully clothed. the ones he had were more ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù videos. third incident and the one where i think my heart entirely shattered. i realized i was logged into his second instagram account too. i saw messages from his main account to his spam, that he sent himself. they were all videos of girls dancing, models, famous women, pretty women, thirst traps, you name it. what hurt me most. the time stamps of the months of those videos were the months i was probably in the worst time of my life ; uni was so tough for me and i didn‚Äôt have a job and my self esteem was at an all time low. the sending himself posts stopped a year ish before the time i checked it, but i genuinely don‚Äôt know if he sent more recent and deleted them. he said he would do this as like petty revenge or retaliation when he was mad at me- but what did i do? i genuinely can not think of a reason i deserved any of this. 4th incident, i saw his link history on his instagram and there were links to only fans pages; he said he was stalking streamers on twitch and was curious. and i believed and forgave all of this. 

main incidents recently. for over a year his sleep schedule has been off-waking up 5-7pm and sleeping in the ams. i‚Äôm alone through the day. i just go to work and do school and see my close friends for coffee. he also does not eat proper meals. he wouldn‚Äôt open my snaps on time when i sent them, wouldn‚Äôt reply to a lot of my updates on messages and i would have to leave 13 missed calls for a call back sometimes. wouldn‚Äôt open my tiktoks or dms i sent him. when i would get frustrated i obviously complained and was like can u pls maybe wakeup or fix it, can you please check my messages or please call me back. i stopped begging and started to just see my friends more. friend from uni- if i would stay with her for more then two days he would complain. i was able to cook food with her, paint with her, dance and listen to music and have fun and do fun activities when im with her. when im at home all i do is wait for him to text me to watch a movie on call. most of our arguments this past two months have revolved around that. me not being home and that im not giving him the time to call to watch something. 

the last incident where i fell apart. we argued the night before about not watching something together, don‚Äôt remember details because it was petty. mid argument he takes my photo out of his wallet and crumples it and throws it out of the window of the car. i think that was it for me. i gifted him that wallet the first two months we met because his was all old and ripped apart and i gifted it with a pic of me in it. it was like he physically grabbed the purest form of love i gave him and threw it away. 

taking a break- 

i probably had my faults too in not being able to settle arguments like an adult; but for our first years together, i saw my messages in arguments. i would be kind, loving, calm, and he would be hurtful, block me, tell me he‚Äôs breaking up with me, etc. im not strong enough to uphold that so obviously towards the end, the last few months ive been very irritated and i snap back, im cold and petty in arguments. 

we decided to take a break on may 17th. he begged to see me , i was ignoring him because i wasn‚Äôt in a good place to talk. he came, agreed to a break(i said break at first in the past weeks but that day i wanted a break up) and he said no let‚Äôs have a break. i told him start with yourself, your sleep, and your eating habits. pick up the gym again or something (not for aesthetics because genuinely he doesn‚Äôt leave the house unless it‚Äôs to see me. the first two days of this break i saw him spirla post on r/depression about how he‚Äôs unlovable and the posts are very self hating, and they are also just everything ive tried to uplift him about. his business he has that supports him is remote and can be done from home. we agreed just update by text when you‚Äôre going out with friends at first, but he texted me a few days after saying he thinks fully no contact is better, we have locations still. i agreed and in those texts he said he would never do anything to hurt me and wants the best for me. that gave me some peace. but then. 

i saw his location outside every other day. restaurants and places. when i begged him to leave the house he wouldn‚Äôt do it? i encouraged him to go see his friends i encouraged him drink go out. he didn‚Äôt. then we go on a break and he‚Äôs out every day. seeing friends he hasn‚Äôt seen in months. it‚Äôs also, he‚Äôs smart with money and when i asked for flowers he said they‚Äôre kinda expensive; i said even grocery store ones every now n then i don‚Äôt mind i just love them. but now there‚Äôs money to go to these nice places with his friends. okay it‚Äôs fine. but yesterday morning i wake up and see his location. he‚Äôs at the airport. okay cool, 10 hours later, he‚Äôs in japan. 

that was supposed to be our trip. we dreamed of it. i made whole documents planning it. i said i wanted to be proposed to there. he didn‚Äôt think to tell me? international trip? 10 hour flight? you didn‚Äôt think to text me hey i know we‚Äôre no contact but i‚Äôm going here and this is who i‚Äôm going with. i don‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs with or if he‚Äôs alone, or when he‚Äôs coming back. 

on top of this im still dealing with work and finishing uni, im taking summer courses to catch up. everyone‚Äôs been telling me i lost weight like absolutely everyone i interact with. i struggle with my image as it is i dont need to be hearing more. we planned a life together. our parents met eachother. our families ate together . how do i explain to my parents. we come from slightly conservative families. his own parents were saying you guys should maybe plan to get married in august. 

readers, if you made it this far i appreciate you. my friends have been so supportive of me. they support my decision, i want to leave, im grieving my relationship and i don‚Äôt know if he himself is thinking ‚Äúshe‚Äôs probably going to leave me i might as well do what i want‚Äù or if he genuinely thinks everything is ok and it‚Äôs going to be a shock when he comes back and i end things. honestly i want to end things now but i feel cruel sending a break up text while he‚Äôs in the city he dreamed of as a kid. 


tl:dr, we were struggling with frequent arguments and went on a break and his location is now in japan without telling me how long he‚Äôs there or who he‚Äôs with, my heart was already broken and my mind made up, i thought id wait for our break to end to see if we would work it out, but leaving the country to go to our dream destination with no update? im done and i wana know how to leave and the best time to do it.

1l02a3w,https://v.redd.it/qk6maaasd54f1,Built an AI rock identifier app!,"Hey everyone, 

I was hiking recently and kept finding interesting rocks but had no idea what they were. I got tired of Googling and built a simple app to solve this problem.

The¬†video shows it in action - snap a photo and get instant geological details powered by Google's Gemini API. The multimodal AI analyzes¬†visual characteristics while pulling from its knowledge base, which¬†honestly works way better than I expected.

I built it using native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and optimized it for quick responses (under 3 seconds). I also¬†programmed it to roast you if you try¬†to identify something that's not a rock (e.g., your coffee mug!)

For¬†monetization, users receive five free¬†premium identifications to try it risk-free. Users can then sign up for a weekly (which further comes with a 3-day free trial) or annual subscription. 

The app is currently under review. I will post the link here¬†once it is published (hopefully soon!). I would love to gather initial thoughts and feedback from the community on iOS app development best practices. I'm also happy to answer questions about the technical aspects and/or share my learnings about prompt engineering and multimodal AI. ",0,1748711697.0,iosdev,0,0.5,False
1l029yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1l029yo/how_can_i_get_my_toddler_to_not_freak_out_each/,How can I get my toddler to not freak out each time I leave the room?,"My son is 15 months old and I think generally a very happy, smart and even ""mature"" toddler.  However, he almost always loses it when I leave the room during the day.  Usually, it manifest in screaming when he realizes I am leaving or sometimes he'll just be sad until he sees me again, which is worse.  I don't think he has a favourite parent, but he does see me less.  I work from home most days, and because of his reaction unless I am on a break or lunch, I feel guilty about even getting a cup of coffee from the kitchen because of his reaction.  

Maybe I am wrong, but I think at this age, he understands what we're saying.  We've tried explaining to him that I have to work, but that I would see him again soon but he still has a bad reaction.  Now, if it's bedtime and my wife is putting him down, he seems fine with it.  He'll wave goodnight to me, and give me headbutt.  He's even fine with me being in his nursery and leaving before he's fallen asleep.  

It just seems to be during the day he'll freak out.  Is this just a phase that he'll get over?  Can we do or say something that'll make him understand I'll be away for only a short while?  When he screams, I don't come back to him, I have to work, so it's not like his screaming has ever worked.  If he has a new toy and I leave, he will be distracted with the new toy, but obviously we can't keep getting him new toys.  ",1,1748711687.0,daddit,4,0.6,False

2 weeks ago while I was commuting home, I saw a crash scene on Beach Blvd, it was a cyclist already passed with drapes over, and a car pulled to the side with the driver talking to the police.

Now, regarding where the scene was, I could deduce how the accident happened. But as a person who also choose to commute to work on my ebike on some occasions, but was driving home that afternoon, I started to think about those who have to commute on bike everyday because they can't afford a car, yet also have to navigate the car-centric streets that was built from yesteryears.

There are bike lanes made, but to say that they are ""usable"" is more of a joke for road cyclists. I would like to hear your thoughts on this, should we continue to build more, or build better bike lanes? Expand the multi-use trail network, or prioritise public transportation?

I'd like to also mention we have a small group that dives into urban transit topics like this, and other urban design issues. It's a Strong Town local chapter for Jacksonville and the surrounding area - Strong Town Northeast Florida. Due to the srd's rules I'll not post the link to the group, however if you are interested, I'll DM the link to the FB group and Discord. And if you aren't interested in social media groups, but would like to share your thought directly, we have a monthly meeting every 1st Sunday at the Urban Grind coffee shop in downtown, at 11 am. Would love to meet you there tomorrow.

For example: We like to ask for food first to get it cooking in the oven so it‚Äôs ready by the time they get to the window, cool concept, works good most of the time. Sometimes people will forget to ask first and the customer will naturally order the drink first. Then the barista/manager will interrupt the person while they are ordering and rudely ask for the food first when they are the ones that forgot?? Like that‚Äôs my issue is being rude to the customer for small reasons.

Or when a customer is not sure what they are ordering because they have never been here before and the barista/manager is just straight up being rude and condescending to them for not knowing something (especially when they are being nice) like we are the coffee experts, not them. 

Or when a customer is clearly in a slight rush ordering and knows what they want and the person taking the order is making it more complicated than it needs to be. Or challenging them on their order when the customer is clearly not feeling it, if that makes sense.

Like I said I am not one of those people at alllll, when people are rude to my coworkers for no reason I‚Äôm always the first to step in.

*Americans already hate tipping, but the president‚Äôs latest tax break will cause more pain for shoppers*

‚ÄúWhen I get to office we are not going to charge taxes on tips, on people making tips,‚Äù Donald Trump¬†[promised on the campaign trail](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/05/26/trump-goes-to-war-with-wealthy-shore-up-maga-base/). ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bell hop, a bartender, one of my caddies ‚Äìyour tips will be 100pc yours.‚Äù

The billionaire president has stayed true to his promise. The bulk of the tax cuts outlined in¬†[Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù tax and spending bill](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/05/28/musk-attacks-trumps-45-trillion-tax-cuts/), currently before the Senate, reward the wealthy.

But one populist clause within the legislation is a plan to scrap federal tax on tips ‚Äì one of Trump‚Äôs key campaign pledges.

The tax break is popular with US service workers ‚Äì everyone from hairdressers to restaurant staff ‚Äì but may not be so popular with customers.

[American tipping culture](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/american-tipping-culture-has-spiralled-out-of-control/)¬†is already in overdrive, and people hate it. A policy that was once the sole domain of the restaurant and hospitality sector has rapidly proliferated since the pandemic. Takeaway coffee orders now prompt demands for a few bucks extra and even stopping by a news-stand for a paper or some gum can lead people to pay an extra 20pc on their bills.

Many Americans have noticed this creep and don‚Äôt like it. As one Reddit user put it online: ‚ÄúWhat the f--- am I tipping for? Is it not bad enough that I just paid over $5 (¬£3.7) for a small bottle of water?‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs tax break is likely to push a wave of new jobs to adopt restaurant-style tipping policies and will incentivise businesses to restructure their employees‚Äô pay, so that they receive a larger proportion of their income from tips.

Maurice Obstfeld, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, says: ‚ÄúNumber one, this is going to induce new employers to classify more compensation as tips.‚Äù

It may already be happening. Chris Bakke, a San Francisco entrepreneur and investor, wrote on X recently:

The message, which may have been a joke, was in response to news that the US Senate had passed the No Tax on Tips act ‚Äì a bipartisan bill proposing a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for cash tips. It is separate to the president‚Äôs proposals, showing the broad support for the policy across the political spectrum.

# $15bn bill

Both Republicans and Democrats present the policy as a boost for blue-collar workers. However, economists warn that people could end up with lower baseline pay as a result of the changes, putting more pressure on customers to top up earnings. That means even more social pressure and financial pain at the checkout.

The plans laid out in Trump‚Äôs tax and spending bill offer the same level of tax break as the No Tax on Tips act. Under the current law, staff are required to report tips to their employer if they total $20 or more in a single month. Businesses then include the tips in salary calculations ‚Äì withholding federal income tax, social security tax and Medicare taxes.

The new exemption will only apply to tips paid in cash, not by card. Workers must earn less than $160,000 per year to qualify and be working in occupations that ‚Äúcustomarily‚Äù receive tips. The US Treasury will publish a list of these occupations when the bill is passed into law.

The total cost to the public purse will be around $15bn per year. The impact on American consumers and tourists visiting the US will also be huge.

Abir Mandal, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, says tax exemptions on tips will create ‚Äúperverse incentives‚Äù for employers. It will encourage businesses to make employees source more of their wages from tips, with a lower proportion from their salaries.

Expectations for tips could also become far more widespread, and bigger. Chris Edwards, a tax expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says: ‚ÄúI think different job types will shift their types of compensation. You can think of all kinds of professions where it could become more normal.‚Äù

Luggage handlers at airports are an obvious potential example, says Mandal. ‚ÄúThey are given a salary. You can give them like $1 or $2 for carrying a bag, but in general they are paid a wage. If this thing takes off, perhaps their income could be reconfigured so that they would make a lower wage but expect a larger tip per bag.‚Äù

# Covid tipping point

Tipping has always been the norm in US restaurants, but something changed during the pandemic. More people had food deliveries and wanted to show their appreciation for drivers,¬†[widening the tipping net](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/why-tipping-no-longer-choice-britain-service-charge/).

At the same time, wage growth accelerated sharply as the economy reopened but restaurant bosses and other small business owners struggled to match it. As a result, demands for tips grew.

‚ÄúThe expectation of tipping has grown quite dramatically,‚Äù says Stephen Barth, an attorney and hospitality law professor at the University of Houston. ‚ÄúIt was already growing and then during Covid it expanded exponentially.‚Äù

The share of bakeries asking for tips has soared from 36pc to 49pc in the five years to July 2024, for example, according to analysis of payroll data by Gusto. Among coffee shops, the proportion has jumped from 56pc to 72pc.

‚ÄúFor a lot of small businesses, they run on very tight margins, which means that owners couldn‚Äôt always raise wages. Tips let them pay more to their employees without hitting their budgets,‚Äù says Nich Tremper, senior economist at Gusto.

The growth of electronic payment terminals, such as Square, has also made it easier to request tips. Whereas with cash it was up to a customer‚Äôs discretion, now they are confronted with a menu of tip options and have to actively opt out. Even some card machines now have this as the default option.

Tips are even now entering shops. The share of retail businesses using tips as part of their employees‚Äô pay nearly doubled in the five years to July 2024, rising from 3.86pc to 6.6pc. One in six health stores, 16.2pc, now pay their staff partly in tips.

If Trump‚Äôs bill passes, tipping will become even more important to staff wages, but potentially also more irritating to give.

‚ÄúOnly cash tips will be untaxed if this legislation passes. There may be added pressure on consumers to pay tips in cash. It‚Äôll make things awkward. And people already hate tips in America,‚Äù says Mandal.

The change to federal tax policy is likely to trigger a wave of similar policies at a state level, he adds. States typically try to conform their own taxable income in line with federal policy.

That may sound good for workers. But Barth says it amounts to just a ‚Äúsubsidy for employers‚Äù. The tax break will reduce pressure on employers to raise wages and companies could actually cut workers‚Äô base pay as a result, demanding they make up the difference through tips.

It hits at the heart of what many customers dislike about the recent transformation in tips. What was once a way of showing appreciation for good services has transformed into an expectation with no real link to the quality of experience. If you don‚Äôt tip, it‚Äôs not a sign that you‚Äôre unhappy with the service ‚Äì it‚Äôs a signal you‚Äôre a bad person.

Obstfeld is scathing: ‚ÄúThis was a campaign promise that was made to essentially pander to voters and the economic rationale for it is basically nil.‚Äù

The public may soon share his anger as demands for tips mount up.",29,1748710857.0,EndTipping,12,0.88,False

She behaves like a spoiled child despite being a full-grown adult with her own income. She constantly relies on my husband to pay for everything, from small things like books on Amazon to huge expenses like a ‚Çπ40,000+ flight for an academic trip abroad (she's doing a PhD). Not just paying for stuff, she expects my husband to driver her around. She even expects my husband to pick her luggage while she roams freely. One time my husband drove home which took almost 4 hours, and she just walked inside, not even bothering to pick up her own luggage, let alone help with ours.

When we go out, she never offers to pay. Never. She‚Äôll just pick out what she wants clothes, meals, whatever, and expects my husband (or sometimes me, by extension) to pay for it. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs a struggling student either. She has her own stipend (which is not a small amount) and could afford to easily cover at least her basic expenses with savings.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt even mind treating loved ones now and then, especially younger cousins or friends. But this isn‚Äôt that. This is a grown woman who feels entitled to be financially supported by her older brother for no reason other than ""I'm the younger sibling."" Meanwhile, my husband and I split all our expenses 50-50. We‚Äôre both working professionals earning similar salaries, and we‚Äôre trying to save for a house, pay off a car loan, and plan for our future. 

When I tried to bring it up with my husband, he got defensive and said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my little sister. I don‚Äôt mind paying for her. It‚Äôs my responsibility.‚Äù He basically shut down the conversation and made me feel like I was being selfish or unreasonable for even mentioning it. My husband tells me that for him, she'll always be a little kid and he'll continue treating her like that, basically implying that I'm overreacting.

But honestly, it‚Äôs not just the money, it‚Äôs the complete lack of awareness or gratitude on her part. She doesn‚Äôt even offer to pay. Even my college-age cousins, when they visit, will at least try to pay for coffee or small meals, and they're not even earning yet. So what gives?

The weight of yesterday‚Äôs events bore down upon him, etching lines of frustration and weariness onto his tailored face. The Virginia City Rangers, under the eager leadership of their trifecta‚ÄîSheriff Larson, The Marshal, and the low-key Katie Atwood‚Äîhad begun charting a course of their own, unheeding of Coleman's rightful command.¬†The Judge, a man accustomed to maintaining order, felt the sting of their defiance.¬†                                                             He held a fondness for Charles Larson, the young, ambitious Sheriff whose eyes gleamed with the promise of a man destined for greater things. In his mind, he could see Larson standing tall among the people, a stalwart figure representing them, should he choose to venture down the trail of politics. His issue with him was his association with The Marshal and their brotherly bond that seemed unbreakable.

He couldn't help but worry about the potential consequences of their actions, the unwanted attention it was beginning to attract. The situation was becoming intolerable. And soon, he would need to explain it to those who governed above him.

Before he could give it more thought, the sound of footsteps in the hallway grew closer to his office, and the door swung open, revealing Larsen and Wallace, who strolled into the office with an air of casual confidence.

And if they don't learn, we will go beyond our boundaries into California, or wherever, and show them.‚Äú                           His frustration mounting, Coleman felt the need to confront the Marshal's disregard for the very rules that governed their actions.                                                                                                                 ‚ÄúSomething you hope for Jack?... Give you an excuse to mobilize your crew? ‚Äú                               Wallace's face remained impassive, unfazed by Coleman's accusation. He shrugged as if the rules were of no consequence.                                                                                                                                    ‚ÄúPeople outside our stretch know our might.¬†Time to consider staking our claim wider, reach beyond just the horizon. And quickly‚Äù

Coleman walked over to his well-stocked bar and poured himself a generous glass of whiskey. *Fucking say something Charles* he thought to himself. It felt as if Charles restrained his opinion so he wouldn‚Äôt offend his comrade. Coleman threw down the shot, the liquid burned down his throat, bringing a temporary respite to the frustrations that began to consume him.                                                            ""You reckon outsiders only see the shine we let 'em see?‚Ä¶ Your little friend Katie. I see she‚Äôs recruiting up in Oregon,‚Ä¶ That young lady has some deep pockets and even bigger ambitions‚Ä¶ Some rumours are circulating, suggesting you intend to invade Bodie. That kinda quickly?.. Seems you people are eager to chart your own course, make your rules.‚Äù                                                                                      ‚ÄúWe talked about this. And the word is that the town of Bodie has become unstable. We can clean it up. Make it part of our jurisdiction.‚Äù Larsen Chimed in.                                                                                       But Coleman‚Äôs voice carried a cold warning.                                                                                            ‚ÄúWord is spreading fast. We don't need those above me, out east, looking at a renegade Marshal and his trigger-happy deputies making their own rules.‚Äù                                                                                    ‚ÄúOr a renegade official making his?‚Äù Wallace said                                                                             Offended, Coleman lays the bottle down hard on the counter. The nerve of this motherfucker.    ‚ÄúCareful, Marshal. Best not forget, I can still have you removed, comprendo? That goes for both of you. I pulled some strings to get you men here. Give you the power that maybe you don‚Äôt deserve.‚Äù    Coleman's voice carried the weight of his authority. But Wallace's nonchalant retort left Coleman simmering. His patience was waning.

He took a moment to collect himself, and Coleman pondered the implications of the lawmen's actions. The Rangers' casual plans to expand into Bodie without his counsel left a bitter taste in his mouth. He couldn't help but question their motivations. But he needed to speak with Charles alone, without Wallace‚Äôs influence.                                                                                                                                  ‚ÄúCharles, there are issues we need to discuss.‚Äô                                                                                           The room fell into a strained silence, broken only by the sound of Coleman's resolute determination. ‚ÄúMarshal, I need to speak with Charles. We need a minute if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù                                         ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                        At this point, it was obvious that Wallace did not care about offending Coleman as he sauntered across the room to the ornate cigar box sitting on Coleman‚Äôs desk. The Marshal's fingers selected a cigar with practiced ease, and he bit off the end with the nonchalance of a man who respected no boundaries but his own.¬†                                                                                                                                                     Coleman stood across the room, stationed behind the bar, blanched, the blood draining from his face. His eyes widened, and his lips pressed into a thin line of barely restrained fury.¬†                                       The Marshal struck a match on Coleman‚Äôs desk with a flick of his wrist, the flame illuminating his face, revealing a well of unfathomable darkness in his eyes, as if swallowing the light and hope alike. In that moment, what Coleman saw chilled him more than the Marshal‚Äôs audacity, and he wondered if anyone else had ever seen what he just did. It took him a beat, but Coleman convinced himself to dismiss the vision that appeared before him. Surely, he thought, it was just the play of shadows‚Äîa trick of the mind as sinister as a mirage of water on the desert horizon.                                                                                 ‚ÄúOk, go ahead,‚Äù Wallace said                                                                                                                               ‚ÄúI mean alone.‚Äù                                                                                                                                       Reluctantly, Wallace obeyed the Judge's command. As he opened the door to walk out, Coleman threw one last thing for him to think about.                                                                                                                 ‚ÄúI am the one in charge of this town, Marshal, you do understand that?‚Äù                                                 ‚ÄúYep, you‚Äôre in charge.‚Äù As he released the smoke from his lips.‚ÄùCan I go now?‚Äù                                Without waiting for an answer, Wallace walked out with a nonchalant swagger. His utter disregard for the hierarchy left Coleman furious, as it was a taunt. The weight of his position settled heavily upon him, reminding him that he could not allow Wallace's insubordination to go unchecked. Coleman now commanded Larsen's attention. He needed to assert his authority, to regain control.                           Along with Larsen, the Judge let out a deep breath, his frustration obvious.                                       Sensing his agitation, Larsen tried to ease the tension with a placating response.¬†                                ‚ÄúWell, that wasn't the ending I anticipated,""¬†Larsen said                                                                              But Coleman was in no mood for appeasement. His voice carried a mix of indignation and weariness as he vented his frustration.                                                                                                                             ‚ÄúFuck you, Charles,‚Ä¶Goddamnit I‚Äôm up to here with him. You start controlling that Gorilla.‚Äù               ‚ÄúJesus, Judge, slow down‚Ä¶ Take a breath. You should consider getting away from all the grit and dust. Maybe you need to take a vacation.‚Äù                                                                                                               ‚Äú‚ÄîI JUST GOT BACK FROM VACATION!‚Äù Coleman shot back.                                                                  ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Larsen stammered.                                                                                                                         Coleman's face began to flush red as his temper rose.                                                                         ‚ÄúYou're telling me I lost the respect of this crew, you don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôve been gone a fuckin‚Äô week?‚Äù Larsen tried to reason with him, to remind him that Wallace was merely a lawman seeking justice and peace. But Coleman felt the surge of defiance, unwilling to be consoled. Coleman's voice held a tone of bitterness, a reminder of the chasm that had formed between him and the uncontrollable Marshal.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unwise to keep your partnership with a man with such reckless impulses. You have ambition, and that‚Äôs ok, but Wallace bathes in the tempest of gunfire. And that could be your downfall, your loyalty.‚Äù Larsen understood the influence the Judge held over the town was waning. Impassioned by his rise to prominence, he urged Coleman to put his trust in him.                                                                                 As Coleman dropped another shot of whiskey, his thoughts shifted to the other concerns that demanded their attention further west. In the past forty-eight hours, there was a massacre in the street.¬† Coleman's focus shifted to the men the Rangers had disposed of, their connection to the larger concerns they would soon face. It was these matters that demanded their immediate attention. The Judge realized that their plans for Bodie needed to wait, that there were more pressing matters at hand. With a resolve born of experience, Coleman acknowledged the need for strategic decision-making. He‚Äôd bide his time, waiting for the winds to shift in his favor.¬†The mining town of Bodie, with its wild spirit and untamed ways, would need to remain in disorder a while longer. For a moment, the Judge poured a silent plea, hoping the lawman might find it within his storied heart to stop, listen, and take to heart the justice he so passionately defended.¬† ‚ÄúYou are becoming a prominent figure, my friend. However, you men need to keep your ambitions to yourself. Right now, I think we should hold off on mobilizing your people into Bodie. There are other concerns further west. The men you disposed of were part of those concerns. And now, it‚Äôs unavoidable.‚Äù                                                                     Coleman contemplated the fate of the town of Bodie. Sheriff Haines‚Äîa mere shadow of justice‚Äîstood on borrowed time as death loomed in its streets.¬† He couldn't help but wonder how their choices would shape the future of that town. A town he believed would eventually fall.                                                Larsen leaned in, his voice a low growl.                                                                                                      ‚ÄúBodie is chaotic. Haines sent several telegrams. Mentioned a certain fella in particular. Now is the time to stake our claim, bring that wayward town to heel.‚Äù                                                                         ‚ÄúPatience,‚Äù Coleman said, measuring each word.                                                                                         ‚ÄúOne man isn‚Äôt reason enough to justify moving a whole unit. It can't be that bad. Haines is still alive.‚Äù Coleman‚Äôs eyes held Larsen‚Äôs with a commanding steadiness. The fight for power and law in Virginia City was done, but the fight for power west of Nevada was just beginning, and both men knew the stakes were high.

Katie Atwood, with the steady hand of a frontier woman, lifted the boiling coffee pot off the fire, its rich aroma mingling with the dust and gun oil that clung to the confines of the jailhouse. She preferred her coffee strong, the kind that put grit in your belly, and let you feel like you could take on just about anything. Her keen eyes surveyed the street outside through the window, watching the locals move through their daily routine. The breeze coming in was a gentle reminder that things can always change. The Prairie winds carried news like whispers in a crowded room.                                                              Her father in New York, a man of vision and power, always taught her to surround herself with the smartest and the strongest. Virginia City was a place to prove that wisdom - a rough-cut gem she helped polish into something brilliant. She had come with a determination that snagged on her ambition, and an idea of what could be, mingled with the drought-thirsty dreams of other settlers looking to carve something out of this landscape.                                                                                      Jack Wallace and Chuck Larsen, stalwarts of the Virginia City Rangers, were building something out here, and Katie was part of it. Her power was subtle but substantial, a player in a game that didn‚Äôt always show her cards. Her savvy kept her one step ahead, even when the shadows loomed with menace.

Enemies were a given, a part of the landscape like the cacti and rattlers. But Katie had learned from the best back East, and she knew money could shift those sands quicker than any gun. When it came time to deal, it'd be her hand that had the better cards. She possessed a pair of aces that promised: one would lead soldiers into one victorious battle after another, and the other would be a politician, a man whose words could galvanize the hearts of those seeking the good life. Her eyes looked out toward a future she was shaping, her resolve as unyielding as the land she now stood on. The iron at her side reminded her that while brains might win you the long game, there was always the chance you‚Äôd have to fight it out in the here and now. With Jack, Charles, and the Rangers, she had people she called her own, and who shared her vision, and it was a vision set on seeing them rise like the sun in the east. It was a journey worth every risk and every hardship because this was more than land‚Äîit was the future, ready to be rewritten in their favor.                                                                                                             Down the street, she spotted Charles Larsen, along with Carl Staulings, making their way up to the jailhouse, kicking up dust as if telling folks they meant business. Staulings had the kind of reputation of a decent man. His presence was steady, his respect hard-earned, and Katie knew that in this realm of shifting alliances, he was someone you kept close. Carl loved Charles because of his ability to communicate with the men. With Wallace, it was more than loyalty that bound him to the Marshal, it was gratitude.¬† For without Wallace's unwavering vigilance, Carl would have been but a forgotten ghost, lying silent beneath the earth in Northern Nevada.

The Marshal leaned against the weathered post of the Virginia City jailhouse, his presence as immovable as the Sequoias that watched the Sierra Nevada. Beneath the shadowed brim of his hat, his piercing green eyes roved with relentless precision, a legacy of a soldier‚Äôs discipline still etched into his bones. He remained a sentinel, his glare dissecting the scene with a methodical gaze from years of battlefield vigilance. He had what the old soldiers called a hundred-yard stare, not the haunted look of men broken by war, but the penetrating stare of one who saw beyond the immediate. At times, he could see the deeper current, those moving about with a hidden motive. Wallace had a penchant for locking eyes with a man, measuring his mettle until the other soul would falter and turn away, unable to withstand the silent challenge. A mere quarter century in age, he carried himself with the unyielding confidence of a man who wore destiny like a well-fitted Stetson. His youthful face, clean-cut but lined with experiences far beyond his years, bore the silent testimony of a dozen battles, each leaving nary a scar on his unraveled myth. One on one, no man could best him. If you matched his speed, he ended it with a flash and a crack to the head. Should his enemy have size and strength, he'd take his time, wearing him down, toying with him like a mongoose does a cobra, step by step, until his adversary is left embarrassed and bloodied, or often, meeting their maker in the end. The Marshal was as sure and deadly as any warrior before him and left no doubt about who would run things west of the Rockies. His heart pulsed with the vigor of a man who recognized there was so much more of the world to explore and so much justice to uphold. And the lord was leading him.                                                                  The good life he had been living this past year was finally getting to him. Restlessness gnawed at Wallace‚Äîmonths of good living seemed to have dulled the edge of his spirit. Aside from that pitiful soul he had roughed up earlier, there was no challenge here.                                                                    ¬†     Katie began to use his reputation to influence ex-soldiers in the Pacific Northwest, but that was still six months away. He pondered his next move. Sure, he could always head out and clash with the Shoshoni tribesfolk‚Äîthey were fierce fighters, and he had no qualms calling those savages his enemy.¬† But that could wait; a larger scheme brewed like a storm on the horizon. Whether he liked it or not, Wallace needed Coleman's half-hearted attempt for expansion, for it was time to steer their path westward, towards the lawless town of Bodie. A big town like Bodie cried out for cleansing, for its soul had been claimed by something dark and sinister. With the almighty whispering in his ear, Wallace aimed to bring law and order, to exorcise the evil that had sunk its fangs deep into the heart of that wild town.          The Gunfighter that Haines had whispered about was beginning to carve out a fearsome reputation, one that threatened the town of Bodie. But reputations were mere echoes of tales past and present, and Wallace had a knack‚Äîan uncanny gift‚Äîfor silencing such echoes in the crash of a single, thunderous gunfight. With divine guidance urging him on, he readied himself, for Bodie awaited, and justice rode with him, hand in hand with the will of God. Once there, Charles Larsen would be appointed as Sheriff, and law and order could take root in that unruly place. Once that was settled, he and Katie could put their complete focus towards the wild expanses of California and Oregon, forging strength in unity and purpose. The Virginia City Rangers would manifest into the Rangers of the Pacific Northwest.¬†                                                                                                                                                     Jack was not a fool, he knew the Rangers‚Äô rise was not by their talent alone. When doubt licked at the edges of his confidence like a predator circling its prey, that familiar voice would appear in his mind, guiding him. Again, it was God: the specter of resolve, would surge forth to banish hesitation with a fierce command. This incorporeal ally was a spirit forged in the crucible of steadfast ambition and ruthless determination. It was a ghostly, powerful companion; the Lord was with him at his best, on the battlefield. He had so many encounters, but his instincts would always come at the perfect time. A dozen or more near-death experiences added to his legend.                                                                    The almighty was unseen yet profoundly felt, who laid a spectral hand on his shoulder‚Äîa touch as cold and certain as death itself. It spoke of legions, whispering that his destiny lay in amassing an army of great, loyal warriors. God urged that the time was ripe in the hushed tones between each gust of wind. The pressing immediacy of its counsel was unmistakable. A storm was brewing on the horizon, and Wallace knew he must muster his forces to meet it head-on.¬†                                                                   Katie, as if materializing from the ether of his thoughts, walked out the front door, and approached him with the grace of an autumn breeze, holding out a cup of coffee as an offering. The rich, bittersweet aroma mingled with the dusty air, grounding Wallace in the moment.                                                   ""Coffee that won the west,"" she said, her voice tender with a hint of playfulness.                              Wallace accepted the cup with a nod, the corners of his mouth lifting in a semblance of a smile.¬†    ""Thanks, honey... Morning.""¬†                                                                                                                           His attention then shifted as Charles Larsen and Carl Staulings ambled up the boardwalk, their steps synchronous with the heartbeat of the town itself. Charles clutched a handbill, bearing a rough-hewn likeness of the notorious Frank Bodie.                                                                                                     Wallace posed a query about the handbill, his curiosity spearing the late morning calm.                Staulings, with a voice that rumbled like distant thunder, replied, ""Men in Bodie are like bad whiskey, too much of it, and too many of them. This regarding that particular chap out there with the itchy trigger.‚Äù¬†                                                                                                                                                        ‚ÄúSeems the whole town has an itchy finger,‚Äù Larsen said                                                                             His words seemed to hang in the air, heavy with implication.                                                                 ""That's the rumbling,"" Wallace countered, his gaze distant as if he could see the unseen forces shaping their fates.                                                                                                                                                      ‚ÄúLord knows anyone can be a good gunfighter with half the town on a fuckin‚Äô bender.""

He paused for effect, a smile tugging at his lips.                                                                                                                                      ""Could be faster than you... But, we have other concerns further out west.

For Wallace, the call of danger was a siren song, and the crack of gunfire a melody sweeter than any ever penned by man. The notion of another showdown set his heart racing like a wild stallion. By all that‚Äôs holy, he relished the thought of it.                                                                                        ‚ÄúSeems to me we ain't heard the last of those hombres.

Larsen continued, he explained to his three comrades that Madrid and his men, according to Haggerty, were on the verge of moving men inside the town of Bodie, if not already. Wallace, with the bitter coffee warming his insides, knew the path forward was fraught with peril. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, he found a steely determination rooting deep within him. The West had always been a land of battles, both seen and unseen, and he was ready to chase the next storm brewing on the horizon.                            Katie leaned back against the wall, listening to the men plan their day, when she heard it. A presence‚Äîvast and unseen‚Äîdescended upon the town, carrying with it an ominous murmur that seemed to curl through the streets like a ghostly wraith. The sinister whisper coiled around her like a serpent, its words indecipherable yet laden with foreboding. Along with several townsfolk, her face was a mask of confusion and unease. She kept her composure as her gaze swept the skies, searching for a source, a sign, anything to explain the inscrutable force that had chosen their town as its haunting ground. Her strength wavered, an unfamiliar pallor draining the color from her cheeks. Whatever it was, it spoke not to the ears but to the soul.¬†                                                                                                                            The voices of Wallace, Larsen, and Staulings prattled on, ignorant of the chill that had wormed its way into Katie‚Äôs bones.¬†*What the fuck was that?* She thought.¬†                                                                        Lost in the moment, she didn‚Äôt realize Jack was now staring right at her, noticing her pale face, his brow furrowed with worry.¬†                                                                                                                            ""You alright, darlin'?"" His voice was suddenly gentle as a breeze after a prairie storm.                            ""I'm ok,"" she replied, though her tone didn't match the steel in her eyes.¬†                                           ""Reckon I need a moment. Feeling a little nauseous.

His rugged hand was ready to offer assistance.                                               Katie shook her head, the fear still gnawing, leaving her to wonder at the shadow that lurked over the city, a premonition carried on the wind of the unknown. There was a shared apprehension with several of the townsfolk that something dark and terrible lingered, an omen that promised to cast its shadow over Virginia City.                                                                                                                                           ‚ÄúYou let us know if you need anything,‚Äù Carl added                                                                                      Not wanting to take their focus from the agenda, Katie played it off and dismissed them from her presence. She walked away, offering her usual reminder.                                                                         ‚ÄúStay vigilant, boys.‚Äù She said                                                                                                                        For a moment, all three men watched Katie with genuine concern.¬†                                                            As Charles spun his tale about Madrid, Wallace leaned against the weathered post. He was always keen to listen when his partner spoke of the future of their outfit, whether it be lurking dangers or the promise of prosperity. With eyes narrow and an expression that knew hard times, Wallace lit a cigar and soaked in every word, knowing well that in these parts, knowledge was oft worth a lot of weight.

**1 year earlier**

In the wild land where the rugged hills of Monterey met the vast, endless stretch of the Pacific Ocean, the gray skies and air held a promise of thunder, like the prelude to an untamable storm. Perched not far from the cliffs that dared to challenge the ocean's relentless assault, lay a fortress of Samuel Madrid. Hidden behind a formidable 230-foot gate, it was a citadel of privacy and might. Inside the gate, armed men made their rounds, ensuring that all who found shelter there remained untouched by any whisper of a threat.                                                                                                                                Within the walls, a grand Spanish-style hacienda stood. At its heart was a lushly verdant courtyard where Madrid‚Äôs notorious gang held sway, their voices rising in camaraderie. They moved about like wranglers of misfortune, masters of a domain that owed its life not to fortune, but to sheer will.     Madrid sat at the helm of his grand table, surrounded by twenty or so of his most loyal riders, men hungry for food and talk of conquest. Madrid was the immovable force in his hacienda‚Äîa burly man of fortitude, bearing his long beard a bushy testament to the wild tales whispered about him. The table was rich with the spoils of a victory, the trappings of power seized through grit and gunfire. A quartet of the local whores, bought and paid were brought in for entertainment as the celebration continued. As a young man, Madrid quickly ascended the ranks of the lawless, his loyalty and cold determination setting him apart. He was not just a brute who relied only on physical strength; rather, his deadliest weapon was his mind, always plotting, always scheming. Madrid‚Äôs presence was a whisper of death, always leaving a trail of fear.                                                                                                                           His transition from petty lawlessness to a formidable power broker was marked by a trail of deceit and bloodshed. Towns that once thrived under the open sky became shadows of themselves, suffocating under Madrid's grip. He didn't just seek control; he wanted utter domination, to bend the will not only of the people of Monterey but San Francisco to his desires.                                                                Madrid's eyes, as sharp and calculating as a gambler‚Äôs in a high-stakes game, surveyed the spread before him‚Äîfood and fortune that spoke of lands wrested from the rugged hills, and gold coaxed from the cold earth by weathered hands. He pushed to control western California, and it was almost in his full control.¬† Now his sights were set on the large mining town of Bodie, where gold miners were making themselves rich, and he wanted a piece of it. He heard about the instability of the large town, and the tales reached his ears of a wraith-like gunfighter who moved with the shadows and somehow outgunned the infamous Murrieta Clan. But Madrid knew better, seasoned by the unforgiving path of the west, dismissed and scoffed at such drivel. Bodie was a place where rough necks roamed with iron at their hips and resolve in their scars, and Murrietta‚Äôs men were fools, charging into an untamed town that knew how to defend itself, and their pride met its end in the dust. An army was what he needed, and an army he would bring. And no foolish tale of a supernatural being jumping from one roof to another was going to keep them from taking it. But, there was one problem further east where trouble brewed steeper than any storybook tale. Over the Nevada stretch, Wallace and his Virginia City Rangers would be the last wall between Madrid and his reign that would stretch across the great Sierra Nevadas. But Madrid was making his move, building alliances in the eastern parts of California. The Rangers were making their moves as well, mobilizing west.¬†He'd never laid eyes on Wallace, but he'd heard enough to rile his temper. The man's reputation for upholding the law with an iron grip and walking through gunfights unscathed was enough to make any outlaw spit with disdain. But what stuck in Madrid‚Äôs craw was this lawman had proclaimed divine protection shielding him from harm, as if he were anointed by the creator himself, some celestial force having a hand in his charmed life.            Madrid looked forward to destroying him. Within the next year, he would send his men into Virginia City, carefully, deliberately, until they blended into the town like shadows. They would pose as simple folk‚Äîranch hands, saloon workers, trappers, store clerks‚Äîand wait patiently. As soon as the Rangers‚Äô vigilance wand, the Monterey Horsemen would strike, and strike hard they would. Madrid was going to wait patiently for the right time and then end the so-called reign of the Virginia City Rangers.          Madrid sat at the end of the table, speaking to his men about the next plan as he brought a savory chicken leg to his mouth with the casual ease of a man who saw the world as his oyster. As the rich flavor enveloped his taste buds, a shadow loomed behind him, casting its presence over the table. It placed both its hands on Madrid‚Äôs shoulder, the way a loyalist would do to show its support. Killion leaned down, whispering, his voice a mere breath against Madrid's ear, weaving tales of conquest and power, painting visions of a California under the reign of The Monterey Horsemen. Madrid's grip tightened on the chicken bone as Killion's words spurred dreams of an empire and grandeur. As a mischievous smile grew on his face, the two men beside him exchanged puzzled looks, wondering what he was listening to. Little did they know, Madrid's mind had already wandered into unknown territories. 

Jack Wallace and his companions, staring down the specter of this man's ambition, understood the depth of the threat Madrid posed. It wasn't just a battle for land or power; it was a fight for the soul of the West, for the freedom that breathed life into its expanses. Madrid, with his dark vision of dominion, stood as the embodiment of everything they sought to protect the world from. As Wallace contemplated the road ahead, the weight of history bore down upon him. Samuel Madrid wasn't just an enemy; he was a harbinger of a future that Wallace could not, would not, accept. In the heart of every man and woman who called the West home, there burned a fire for freedom, a desire for a life forged by their own hands, not dictated by the whims of a tyrant. The battle to come would not be easy, but in the challenge, Wallace saw the glimmer of hope, a chance to reclaim the destiny of the West from the clutches of darkness. He and God would make them understand that what Wallace was doing was destiny. The future of the Rangers of the Pacific Northwest would be influenced by God.

1l01rst,https://i.redd.it/kfjmkn3wd54f1.jpeg,Five Charged In MBTA Falsifying Track Inspection Records Days Ahead of Finnerty Conviction,"BOSTON ‚Äì Four former Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (‚ÄúMBTA‚Äù) employees and one current MBTA employee were charged today with allegedly falsifying Red Line track inspection reports.  

Brian Pfaffinger, 47, of Marshfield; Ronald Gamble, 62, of Dorchester; Jensen Vatel, 42, of Brockton; Nathalie Mendes, 53, of New Bedford; and Andy Vicente, 36, of Bridgewater have been indicted for falsification of records, aiding and abetting; and false statements, aiding and abetting. Pfaffinger, Gamble, Vatel, Mendes and Vicente were arrested this morning and will appear in federal court in Boston later today.

According to the charging documents, Gamble, Vatel, Mendes and Vicente were former MBTA track inspectors. Rather than complete inspections, during the period between Sept. 3, 2024, to Oct. 15, 2024, Gamble, Vatel, Mendes and Vicente allegedly falsified track inspection reports, which stated that they completed track inspections for Red Line tracks when they did not perform the inspections. Instead, it is alleged that at the time of the inspections, Gamble, Vatel, Mendes and Vicente were inside Cabot Yard, an MBTA location that contained a coffee and breakroom for Red Line inspection employees. Cabot Yard also contained a large garage (‚ÄúCabot Garage‚Äù) where Gamble, Vatel and Vicente allegedly worked on private vehicles during work hours.

On Sept. 19, 2024, during the time that Vicente allegedly performed a track inspection, video surveillance depicted Vicente (circled in red below) sitting inside of Cabot Garage holding his cellular phone.

On Sept. 23, 2024, during the time that Mendes allegedly performed a track inspection, video surveillance depicted Mendes (circled in red below) sitting inside her vehicle. Mendes allegedly did not leave her vehicle until well after her inspection ended.

Pfaffinger, the former supervisor for Gamble, Vatel, Mendes and Vicente, allegedly not only knew that his subordinates worked on private vehicles during work hours, but had his subordinates work on his own vehicle.  

On Oct. 14, 2024, Gamble created an inspection report alleging he conducted an inspection; however, according to surveillance video, Gamble was inside of Cabot Garage with Pfaffinger. Despite knowing that the inspection report was false, and that Gamble was at Cabot Garage on Oct. 14, 2024, the following day, Pfaffinger allegedly created supporting documentation for Gamble‚Äôs Oct. 14, 2024, inspection, which he knew to be false.  

The charges of falsification of records and aiding and abetting the falsification of records provides a sentence of up to 20 years in prison to be followed by up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charges of false statements and aiding and abetting false statements provides a sentence of up to five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

United States Attorney Leah B. Foley; Elise Chawaga, Principal Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General; and Jonathan Mellone, Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Region of the Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General made the announcement today. Valuable assistance was provided by the United States Postal Inspection Service. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lucy Sun of the Public Corruption Unit is prosecuting the case.

1l01rdm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l01rdm,Having trouble achieving the sound quality I want in Apple Music,"Hey everyone! I have used Apple Music/iTunes since 2006, in 2016 or so I switched to Spotify, and now trying to go back to Apple Music. I am blown away by the highs and lows of Apple Music, however, I'm noticing that some songs sound utterly orgasmic, and others... make me want to cry in a bad way. 

Songs I've listened to trying to figure out how to make my sound cohesive (I listen to everything):

Bad Friend by Rina Sawayama
No Good by Knuckle Puck
I'm Like a Lawyer~ by Fall out Boy
Tell me How by Men I Trust

Bad Friend and Tell me How sound so beautiful, I'm in awe. The highs and lows and even the mids come through beautifully, it sounds like it was *made* for Apple Music. 

No Good by Knuckle Puck and the FOB song, the voices are incredibly muddled. Lows and highs on drums (bass, hihats, cymbals) sound amazing, guitars (mostly) sound amazing, vocals get absolutely destroyed and drowned out. Rock as a genre overall has a more ""cohesive"" sound, especially diy bands with distortion etc, but I'm trying to get the vocals to sound good in rock/alt/etc AND the music to sound good with (modern) hip hop (I tried listening to Biggie the other day on Apple Music and the hi hats were SO LOUD and overpowering, I think because it wasnt mastered the way songs are now, and maybe Apple Music doesnt know how to handle it? Not sure. 

I'm hoping someone (please üò≠) can help me with this. If anyone has the time to listen to the songs and look at their settings or what they're doing and let me know how to fix this, I would be so grateful.  I even started experimenting with using the lossless through the hdmi connector, which is when I *really* heard a big difference with Bad Friend and Tell me How, but the KP and FOB songs sounded just as fuzzy.

Weight Loss: Down 22 lbs without counting calories or tracking macros. Just whole foods, lots of movement, and listening to my body.

Used to feel like I was dragging by 3 PM, now I power through the day without needing that extra coffee. No crashes. 

Zero bloating. That alone has made this entire journey worth it. My gut just works now.

 My skin cleared up significantly (probably from cutting out dairy and processed junk), and I sleep like a rock.

The brain fog is gone. I feel sharper, more focused, and way less moody.

I'm eating 
Breakfast: 3-egg veggie scramble with avocado and a side of berries

Lunch: Grilled chicken salad with olive oil + lemon dressing

Dinner: Seared salmon with roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli

Snacks: Almonds, jerky, and the occasional banana with almond butter

On Lazy Days: I'll eat one of my Ready premade meals from Eat Clean for dinner

I prep in bulk on Sundays to keep it simple during the week. I also don‚Äôt freak out if I‚Äôm not 100% perfect all the time. Balance keeps it sustainable for me.

Going Paleo taught me how good my body can actually feel when I feed it real food. It‚Äôs not about being restrictive. It‚Äôs about getting back to basics and fueling myself with things that serve me.

If anyone‚Äôs thinking of trying it or has questions, happy to chat! This community has been such a great source of info and motivation.

Unlike in many other countries, breakfast in France is usually light and sweet, especially during the week. Here are a few common elements:

ü•ñ Bread with butter and jam, often a fresh baguette
ü•£ Cereal with milk (especially for kids)
‚òï Coffee or tea, sometimes with a splash of milk
üç´ Hot chocolate ( was my classic choice when I was a child)
ü•ê Viennoiseries like croissants or pain au chocolat (mostly on Sunday for me)

üëâ At home, breakfast is quick and simple. It‚Äôs not uncommon for adults to skip it altogether or just grab a coffee before work.

But there‚Äôs much more to it, especially when it comes to caf√© culture, how kids eat, and why French people rarely eat savory things like eggs or bacon in the morning (but I personally like it).

1l01ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/masculinemennow/comments/1l01ngz/why_your_fasts_feel_terrible_and_its_not_just/,Why your fasts feel terrible (and it's not just hunger),"You start a fast.

Energy feels stable at first.

Then out of nowhere‚Äîbam. Headache. Brain fog. Low-key nausea. You feel off. Lightheaded walking upstairs, zero motivation to train, and everything feels harder than it should.

This isn‚Äôt just low blood sugar.

And no, it‚Äôs not your willpower breaking.

This is usually electrolyte crash. And it‚Äôs *way more common* during fasting than most people realize.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

# Fasting doesn‚Äôt just drop calories‚Äîit drops salt

When you fast, insulin drops.

Sounds great, right?

But here‚Äôs the catch most people miss: low insulin = kidneys dump sodium faster.

And when sodium drops, water follows.

That‚Äôs why a lot of people feel ‚Äúdehydrated‚Äù even when they‚Äôre drinking a gallon of water. It‚Äôs not water they‚Äôre missing. It‚Äôs salt.

# What that feels like in real life

You won‚Äôt always feel thirsty.

Instead, it shows up like this:

* Headache by hour 14 of a fast  
* Standing up too fast = dizziness  
* Feeling ""flat"" in the gym even when rested  
* Random irritability or weird mood dips  
* Legs feel heavy when walking or training  
* Waking up at 3 AM for no reason  
* Craving salty snacks HARD at night  

That‚Äôs not your body telling you to eat.

It‚Äôs asking for minerals.

# Why water alone makes it worse

You might think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just drink more water.‚Äù

Problem is, plain water with zero electrolytes dilutes your system even more.

So you pee more. You feel lighter-headed. And you *might* even mess with your sleep.

You‚Äôre basically rinsing out the last bit of sodium your body has left.

# Which electrolytes matter most?

All three are important:

* **Sodium** ‚Äì the big one. Drives fluid balance, muscle function, nerve signaling  
* **Magnesium** ‚Äì affects sleep quality, muscle recovery, mood stability  
* **Potassium** ‚Äì helps with muscle contractions, blood pressure, overall hydration  

But if you‚Äôre fasting or low-carb, sodium is usually the biggest missing piece.

# When you‚Äôre likely to crash the hardest

Some people can get away with low electrolytes.

Others? Not so much.

If any of these are true, you‚Äôll crash faster:

* You sweat a lot (training, sauna, hot climate)  
* You‚Äôre on a low-carb or keto diet  
* You‚Äôre doing 16:8 or longer fasts consistently  
* You drink tons of coffee (diuretic)  
* You cut processed foods (less hidden sodium)  

You‚Äôre not weak if fasting hits you hard.

You‚Äôre probably just depleted.

# How to know if it‚Äôs really electrolytes

Easy test.

Next time you feel that crash‚Äîfoggy, irritable, shaky, weak‚Äîtry this:

Don‚Äôt eat.

Just get some high-sodium liquid (salt water, broth, or a clean electrolyte mix) and wait 20 minutes.

If you feel noticeably better?

That wasn‚Äôt hunger. That was salt deficiency.

# What to not do

Don‚Äôt just chug table salt in water. It works, but most people gag or wreck their stomach doing it.

Also don‚Äôt rely on sports drinks loaded with sugar. That defeats the whole point of fasting.

Start simple:

* Add salt to your water (if you can tolerate the taste)  
* Sip bone broth mid-fast  
* Use a clean electrolyte source that doesn‚Äôt break your fast  

Even just doing this 2‚Äì3x a week on long fasts can make a massive difference.

# TL;DR

* Fasting drops insulin ‚Üí insulin drop makes kidneys flush sodium  
* Sodium loss = dizziness, brain fog, weakness, bad sleep  
* Water doesn‚Äôt fix it‚Äîelectrolytes do  
* Most common during low-carb diets or longer fasts  
* Salt is the real missing piece, not more food or caffeine",1,1748710114.0,masculinemennow,0,1.0,False

1l01jtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l01jtt/caffeine_was_the_cause_of_95_of_my_problems_wow/,Caffeine was the cause of 95% of my problems. Wow.,"I‚Äôve been caffeine-free for six months now, and I can honestly say it‚Äôs one of the most life-changing decisions I‚Äôve ever made. I‚Äôm still kind of in awe, honestly, not just at how much has changed, but at how long I spent thinking caffeine was helping me, when it was quietly wreaking havoc in the background of my life.

One of the biggest shifts I‚Äôve experienced is the complete disappearance of my social anxiety. For years, I thought it was just who I was, that I was naturally awkward or introverted or just bad at handling social situations. I never imagined that the jumpiness, the racing heart, the mental fog in conversations could all be connected to caffeine. But once I quit, it was like a layer of static noise just vanished. I can hold eye contact. I can speak without second-guessing myself mid-sentence. I actually look forward to being around people now. That constant background tension is just gone.

My digestion has also completely transformed. I used to deal with unpredictable gut issues, bloating, weird stomach pains, rushing to the bathroom after meals. I blamed it on food intolerances, stress, anything else. Turns out, caffeine was throwing my entire digestive system out of whack. Six months off, and my gut feels calm, balanced, and healthy in a way I didn‚Äôt know was possible. I‚Äôm not afraid of what I eat anymore.

And the energy. I used to think caffeine gave me energy. But it was always a rollercoaster, brief highs followed by brutal crashes, then needing more just to feel normal again. Now, my energy feels natural, steady, and sustainable. I don‚Äôt need a fix. I wake up with energy and carry it through the day, without ever feeling like I‚Äôm dragging myself from one moment to the next.

What‚Äôs surprised me most, though, is this deep, profound sense of peace I feel. My baseline state used to be wired, always buzzing, always a little tense, like something bad was just around the corner. Now, my mind is quiet. I feel calm in a way that‚Äôs hard to describe. There‚Äôs this stillness inside me that I never thought I‚Äôd get to feel, not artificially calm, not sedated, just okay. Like my nervous system finally stopped screaming.

My days feel so much longer now. Before, I‚Äôd blink and it would be evening, like the day slipped through my fingers in a blur of stimulation and exhaustion. But now, each hour feels expansive. I‚Äôm present. I remember things more clearly. I experience my life instead of rushing through it. It‚Äôs like time has opened up for me. Each day honestly feels 10x longer. I'm still not used to it. I'll do an activity, and look at the clock thinking an hour or two has passed, only to realize it's been about 20-30 minutes!! It's making me feel like each and every day is super long. Almost like I'm living a longer life now, if that makes sense.

Sleep has also become sacred again. I fall asleep easily, I stay asleep, and I wake up feeling rested. Not groggy. Not in a fog. Not craving a stimulant to function. Just truly, deeply rested, like my body actually had time to heal overnight. That kind of rest is life-changing.

And finally, my ability to focus has exploded. I can study or work for long stretches without needing breaks. My mind locks in, and I go deep. I don‚Äôt fidget. I don‚Äôt reach for distractions. I used to think I had ADHD, or that I was just a bad focus person. Turns out I was just overstimulated. My brain works beautifully when it's not constantly being pushed and pulled by a chemical I thought I needed. It's such a powerful feeling to just be able to start studying or working without having to ingest a drug first. The dependency is completely gone.

Six months ago, I had no idea caffeine was doing all this. I thought I was just broken in a dozen small ways, anxious, tired, scattered, stressed, sensitive. I didn‚Äôt realize I was poisoning myself a little bit every day.

I‚Äôm not saying quitting caffeine is easy. Withdrawal was rough. But the clarity, calm, and health I‚Äôve gained from being free of it is beyond worth it. If any of this resonates with you, if you‚Äôve ever wondered what life might feel like without caffeine, I encourage you to try it. Give your body and mind the chance to find their natural rhythm again.

You might just be amazed by who you really are underneath the buzz.

\----

Just for reference, I was consistently drinking 3 cups a day. All black coffee.

What I did to cut it out was, over the span of about 1.5 months, taper it down slowly by reducing half-cup per week, starting with the very last cup of the day. So for example:

Week 0 - 1st cup, 2nd cup, 3rd cup

Week 1 - 1st cup, 2nd cup, half 3rd cup

Week 2 - 1st cup, 2nd cup, nothing

Week 3 - 1st cup, half 2nd cup, nothing

Week 4 - 1st cup, nothing, nothing

Week 5 - half 1st cup, nothing, nothing

Week 6 - nothing, nothing, nothing

I really didn't have too many withdrawal symptoms this way. After week 6 I was slightly tired and unmotivated for about a week or two but that was it.

After about week 7, I started noticing more and more benefits the subsequent weeks.",47,1748709855.0,decaf,9,1.0,False

Midnight had settled quietly across the Ashandar fields, the stars glowing bright and calm above us like watchful sentinels of their own. The cool air moved softly through the wheat, and the ground held onto the warmth of the day. My internal clock ticked over to exactly 12:00 AM as my systems continued to hum gently in standby. I could still hear the gentle breathing of Honor, curled up safely between Gulabo‚Äôs forelegs. His small chest rose and fell steadily, his legs twitching every so often as if still dreaming of running through the lanes we made for him just hours ago.

Connor sat quietly on a flat rock near my right tread, leaning against my side. He hadn‚Äôt gone to sleep. His eyes, though tired, stayed open, scanning the stars as if they had answers to questions he didn‚Äôt ask out loud. His helmet rested beside him, and his rifle lay across his lap, untouched. His boots were scuffed with dried dust, his jacket unzipped halfway to let the breeze cool him. ‚ÄúYou ever think the quiet is louder than the battle?‚Äù he muttered, mostly to himself.

Brick‚Äôs engine gave off a soft, steady purr as he kept his systems active for warmth. ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he said, his voice low and calm. ‚ÄúBut I like it. Makes me feel like we earned this peace.‚Äù

Reaper circled slowly above at 1,000 feet, his engines quiet but present, wings catching moonlight as he did gentle orbits around the perimeter. ‚ÄúSkies are clear. Not a trace of movement for twenty miles.‚Äù His voice echoed faintly through the comms.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù came Ghostrider‚Äôs deep-toned reply. He held steady at 1,500 feet, his massive AC-130 body floating through the cool air like a guardian angel over our heads. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it that way.‚Äù

Khanzada stood tall, awake and still beside his resting family. His breath formed small clouds in the cooler air. Gulabo stirred slightly and blinked open her eyes. ‚ÄúIs everything alright?‚Äù she asked softly.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Khanzada replied with a quiet bellow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ watching him. He‚Äôs strong. He‚Äôs going to be something this world‚Äôs never seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe already is,‚Äù she murmured.

Vanguard, parked directly on my left, had his repair ports closed but had not entered rest mode. His systems glowed a gentle green. ‚ÄúHis energy signature is already stronger than a typical calf‚Äôs. He has resilience in his blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom both parents,‚Äù Artemis added, his launcher arms tucked down as he remained still in a support position behind us. ‚ÄúKhanzada‚Äôs brute strength, Gulabo‚Äôs calm, and something new‚Äîsomething‚Ä¶ unknown.‚Äù

At 2:45 AM, a light dust breeze came through from the west. Titan, still quiet since nightfall, finally spoke up from the far edge of the formation, positioned like a shadow barely seen. ‚ÄúThe horizon is clean,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll keep watching it. I don‚Äôt like how still it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou worry too much,‚Äù said Striker with a mechanical chuckle, hovering slowly at 1,200 feet with his rotors keeping him aloft above the treeline. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you sleep with your turret half-rotated.‚Äù

Bulldog, parked directly behind Brick and me, let out a rumbling laugh. ‚ÄúThat, or he‚Äôs scared of a baby bull.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard that,‚Äù Titan growled.

Honor stirred a bit around 4:30 AM, his hooves kicking gently at the dirt as he woke up and yawned. ‚ÄúIs it morning yet?‚Äù he asked groggily.

‚ÄúNot yet, little one,‚Äù I said, my voice soft over internal comms. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

By 5:15 AM, the first signs of dawn began to glow behind the hills, the darkness lightening just slightly with that orange-purple hue that signaled the world was waking up again. My sensors picked up the temperature rising to 73¬∞F.

Connor stood, stretching his arms with a yawn. He zipped his jacket up again and picked up his helmet. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs get everyone checked for diagnostics.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready on it,‚Äù Skyreach said, cruising at 900 feet with his sleek Stingray body making no more noise than a gust of wind. ‚ÄúAll units reporting nominal. Fuel and ammo levels steady. Sentinel, you‚Äôre still operating at 97.8% efficiency.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than most coffee machines,‚Äù Connor muttered.

Falcon streaked past overhead at 15,000 feet, his voice breaking through with crisp sharpness. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a weather shift coming in from the north. Clear skies for now, but heat‚Äôs coming. I estimate we‚Äôll be at 90 by noon.‚Äù

By 6:37 AM, the sun finally broke the horizon. The field turned gold, the wheat tips glowing like fire. Gulabo and Khanzada stood and stretched, Honor bouncing on his hooves, full of energy again. He let out a tiny moo and ran in a small circle.

‚ÄúSlow down,‚Äù Gulabo called with a smile in her voice.

‚ÄúNever!‚Äù Honor shouted joyfully, sprinting between Brick and Artemis.

Reaper dipped low to 600 feet and called out, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs already faster than Brick.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Brick rumbled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got four legs. I‚Äôve got four wheels and pride.‚Äù

Breacher, who had stayed completely still all night beside Artemis, shifted slightly and powered up his systems. ‚ÄúLet him run. This land‚Äôs safer now. Let him learn it.‚Äù

Avenger rolled forward slightly, his launcher arms scanning the sky. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll run flight drills with him when he‚Äôs ready.‚Äù

Connor finished checking my systems and Vanguard‚Äôs by 8:15 AM. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good, big guy,‚Äù he said, patting my side. ‚ÄúStill running cleaner than any tech back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not back home,‚Äù I said plainly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm where I belong.‚Äù

By 10:30 AM, the sun was high, and the temperature had climbed to 89¬∞F. The wheat rustled in steady waves, and Honor had now slowed down, resting in the shade between Striker and me.

Khanzada stood protectively nearby, his eyes sweeping the land. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to remember this place. These days. They‚Äôll shape him.‚Äù

Connor stood with his arms crossed, looking at the team, each one accounted for. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not just going to remember. He‚Äôs going to carry it forward. Every part of this.‚Äù

By 11:52 AM, the field shimmered with heat. 93¬∞F. Reaper, Ghostrider, Falcon, and Skyreach all maintained steady aerial coverage while we on the ground formed our natural circle around the youngest among us.

Connor knelt again beside Honor. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got every one of us behind you, kid.‚Äù

Honor blinked. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

At exactly 12:00 PM, my systems logged the new hour. 94¬∞F.

1l01ca6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingsCanada/comments/1l01ca6/are_paper_coupons_making_a_comeback/,Are Paper Coupons Making A Comeback?,"For reference, I live in Calgary.

I'm curious to know if other people also believe that paper coupons are making a comeback. In my opinion, they seemed to start to disappear about 10 years ago. I started to see less and less in stores, websites that you could order coupons started to go by the wayside. 

I assumed this is because it is easier to save money digitally. I don't know if anybody still uses Checkout 51 but that certainly influenced my shopping habits for the first couple of years it came out. Paper flyers no longer seem to be a thing. And it's easier than ever to price-match at stores that still allow it. I've also noticed that certain brands are partnering with certain grocery stores so you can upload money saving coupons to your loyalty card.

And yet over the past 2 or 3 months I've noticed what feels like a resurgence of paper coupons throughout stores I regularly shop at such as Save-On-Foods, Real Canadian Superstore, and Safeway. The coupons are all for stuff I regularly use: yogurt, milk, coffee creamer, and paper towel. Right now I'm feeling as happy as a pig in mud. The other day I went to buy paper towels that were on sale and was delighted to see $2 off coupons for the same brand. It feels like years since I last spend less than $5 on a 6-pack of name-brand paper towels. 

I feel like I'm becoming the ""Coupon King"". I have coupons all over my fridge and I've put their respective expiry dates in my calendar. 

If paper coupons are making a comeback, I wonder why this is. Perhaps it's for brands to connect directly with consumers so they can be the ones to take the credit for people saving money? Whatever the reason, I'm not complaining. All the coupons I've picked up lately have expiry dates between June 30 & March 31. ",3,1748709306.0,SavingsCanada,0,1.0,False

But honestly, I‚Äôm done. The service has been a mess way too many times‚Äîwrong orders, spilled coffee, poor packaging, long delays, even times when the coffee just didn‚Äôt show up.

Today was the final straw. I ordered coffee for guests, and they sent me half a cup of something completely undrinkable. I spent four hours going back and forth with customer service on WhatsApp and phone calls‚Äîonly to have nothing resolved. No replacement, just lack of efficiency, just more waiting and frustration.

What makes it worse is that 30 North isn‚Äôt cheap. I‚Äôve literally been throwing money at them just to maybe get a decent coffee. I work long hours and don‚Äôt have time to make my own. I have staff, but I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs right to ask them to make me coffee either. So ordering has been my solution‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs become more of a gamble than a convenience.

Does anyone know a reliable coffee place that actually takes pride in their service? Clean, consistent, and responsive when something goes wrong? Bonus if they have great beans. I'm officially open to recommendations.

Thanks in advance!

1l011gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1l011gn/i_never_get_to_be_home_alone/,I never get to be home alone,"My husband works from home. I work about 50 hours per week as a high school teacher running two clubs. 

My job is tiring. I have MS, which adds to the fatigue component. I also have anxiety and depression. 

Most days when I get home, I just want silence. I end up feeling over stimulated and tired, and enjoy resting. Having 20-30 minutes of silence and lying down is golden. 

On weekends, I crave my old life when I was single. I could wake up, do whatever, have my own schedule, and move about my house. 

My husband basically never. leaves. the. house. In a given month, he leaves the house maybe for a total of five hours. The rest of the time he‚Äôs home. His work is spread all over the couch, coffee table, dining table. 

Once I get home from work he talks at me nonstop. He shares every random article and Reddit post and birds at the bird feeder. He talks and talks and talks. 

I find myself more and more just retreating upstairs and sleeping to having some semblance of alone time. He even talks to me through the bathroom door while I‚Äôm pooping. He follows me upstairs now and sits and talks at me, often until I fall asleep. 

We are in couples therapy and I go to therapy on my own as well. We‚Äôve discussed time and time again that I feel so overwhelmed with him. He‚Äôs promised to try to leave the house more - go out, run errands, see a friend, work from a coffee shop. But his behavior never changes. 

I just want silence in my day. I want to be alone. I think I‚Äôm at the point where the drawbacks outweigh the benefits of this marriage. I actually can‚Äôt name a benefit, except that he pays half the bills. That‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt feel like enough to stay married. ",158,1748708523.0,AskWomenOver30,100,0.99,False

""What is it, Kaminari?"" Asked Izuku, ignoring his classmates jokes about the blonde 

""Well, Kiribro was bummed the festival is over but couldn't sing and I was thinking about doing the recital again, for us! And, this time, everyone could participate! I just thought a way of making it extra fun"" Responded the pikachu wannabe

...

Aizawa opened the dorms door to check on his class before another quick sweep of the school grounds in his search of Nemuri and Hizashi and, finally calling it a day. He wasn't ready for what he found:

Everyone was, for some ungodly reason, floating and dancing around, he could see Izuku and Jiro dancing in the ceiling while attached to it by black whip and her cords respectively, Nemuri was the center of a small cluster of students and Hizashi made his presence quickly known by floating past with a manic grin on his face.

But the worst of it was the singing: there was no rhythm, no musical accompaniment, no nothing, Mineta was plainly screeching his heart out for coffee's sake!

Why the fuck was everyone singing ""Float on"" was a mystery well above his paycheck, but, seeing there where two teachers and he didn't need to find them, Aizawa cut his losses short and went to bed: it was tomorrow's problem",1,1748708512.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

It's as if each leaf and petal whispers stories of my past, tender memories that gently unfold with the rustling breeze. 

Have you ever noticed how certain moments linger in your heart like the scent of blooming jasmine? In my garden, those memories exist as delicate bouquets that never wilt. Each fragrant bloom carries a cherished moment‚Äîa morning walk in a sunlit park, a laugh shared over coffee, or just the blissful silence under the starlit sky.

In tending to my garden, I find a reflection of nurturing the inner soil of my being. Just like the care I give to each plant, I nurture these memories, allowing them to root and blossom into sentiments of peace and joy. It's a ritual that comforts me, a fragrant dance between the past and the present. 

I wonder, do you have these moments too? Those little garden whispers that remind you of happiness, that linger long after they've passed? Let's share those scents of memory here, and perhaps together, our gardens will flourish even more abundantly.",7,1748708314.0,soulsoil,0,0.9,False
