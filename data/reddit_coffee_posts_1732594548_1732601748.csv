1h053gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h053gh/what_is_the_best_k_cup_coffee_machine/,What Is The Best K Cup Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a mission to find the perfect K-cup coffee machine, and let me tell you, it's been quite a journey. After trying out different models and spending countless hours researching, I want to share what I've learned.

First off, let's be real - nothing beats the convenience of K-cup machines. Just pop in a pod, press a button, and boom - fresh coffee in under a minute. But not all machines are created equal, and I learned this the hard way.

After testing several models, I found that the Keurig K-Elite is currently crushing it in terms of value for money. The temperature control is spot-on, and it lets you brew anything from a strong 4-ounce cup to a travel-mug-filling 12-ounce serving. Plus, it has this neat iced coffee feature that's perfect for summer.

But here's the thing - your perfect machine depends on what you're looking for. If you're tight on counter space, the Keurig K-Mini Plus is amazing. It's slim, stylish, and still makes great coffee. For coffee snobs (no judgment, I'm one too), the K-Supreme Plus has multiple strength settings and temperature controls.

Here's what to look for when buying a K-cup coffee maker:
- Water reservoir size (trust me, refilling gets old quick)
- Cup size options (more is better)
- Temperature control (crucial for perfect extraction)
- Strength settings
- Auto-off feature (saves energy and peace of mind)

You can check out these models and compare prices here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

The coolest part about modern K-cup machines is how they've evolved. Some now have milk frothers built-in, which is perfect if you're into lattes or cappuccinos. The Keurig K-Cafe is brilliant for this, though it's pricier than basic models.

One thing I wish someone had told me earlier - regular cleaning is super important. These machines can get gunked up pretty fast, affecting coffee taste and brewing performance. I clean mine monthly with vinegar, and it makes a huge difference.

For the best value proposition, I'd suggest going for a mid-range model with features you'll actually use. No point paying extra for a milk frother if you only drink black coffee, right?

Want to explore the full range of K-cup coffee makers? Check them out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, consider getting a reusable K-cup filter. It's better for the environment and lets you use your favorite ground coffee when you want to mix things up.

Bottom line - the ""best"" K-cup coffee machine really depends on your needs. But if I had to pick one all-rounder, the K-Elite wins for its balance of features, reliability, and price point. It's not the cheapest, but it's definitely worth the investment if you're serious about your daily coffee fix.

Remember, a good coffee maker is an investment in your daily happiness. Trust me, starting your day with a great cup of coffee makes everything better!",1,1732601041.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Sometimes you catch yourself thinking of other lifetimes.  Parallel realities.  I don't seem to think you believe in that sort of thinking; this life is what we get, this person is who I am.  If I'm lucky you believe in an afterlife, and I sometimes wish I could believe that we were happy merely to see us there.  

It's easier to imagine us being happy, there, after death.

Started making the coffee as usual this morning. Got the black liquid part of it done, then switched to milk frothing. While it was doing its thing, I noticed some steam coming out of the part where the coffee was coming from before, even though the portafilter was still installed. Then, when rotating the portafilter handle, there was a “boom” accompanied by some coffee flying in all directions. Seems like the machine built some pressure and released it instead of using it for milk frothing. The milk was quite cold. No errors shown before, during or after the event. Now I’m a bit afraid to touch the machine, so doing what any grown up would do - using Reddit instead.

1h04yt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1h04yt3/just_a_vent/,Just a vent...,"I'd like to  rant about my enabler father and his non-relationship with my kids, even with him being dead for nearly two years now. Brought on by a talk with some of my (young adult) offspring.

So when I got pregnant with my first, I met up with him and told him, essentially using a variation of ""You're being a Grampa, dad!""  
To which he immediately answered: ""Oh, not Grampa, please! Let them call me by my name.""   
A few years earlier, he, who always wore a beard my whole childhood, started to cleanly shave - because his beard showed white hairs. He didn't want to seem old.

I finally had three kids 20 months apart each, which made travel a hassle anyway, and no car, which made it even harder, and still I managed to visit him once or twice at his place. Where he never had any toys and didn't interact with the kids. I remember one of them once ask-telling him ""I want to have a sleepover at your place"" - and him answering ""Oh, that's not possible, I have no wife."" Since they were around five back then I still fail to see why he'd need a wife around for that.

At that time I still repeatedly invited him over, which he always put off and blamed on his poor eyesight since he didn't drive anymore and needed his SO to drive him around.   
I told him over and over again he just needed to take the tram (5 mins relaxed walk) to the train station (15 mins drive plus 3 mins walk) and then take a train (straight from his to ours, 40 mins, always empty seats available) and then I'd fetch him from the train station (5 mins by car). But he didn't want to, and okay, he was in his seventies back then - but my 88 years old FIL just last year stopped doing the exact reverse travel with me getting him from the train station, and that man used his ebike to get to the train station, even once took the bike with him so he didn't need to be fetched by me.

So our visits were mainly birthdays of me or the kids, with the kids getting their present (bought and packaged by me, handed over in front of the door), a few half-hearted questions about their progress in school, and then... ignored.   
When he tried to put off school enrollment of my youngest because he planned to go on a short trip with his SO, I talked shop with him. Told him if he didn't show up he'd never again need to bother. He got the message and came over - back then he still drove his car.

Whenever we talked on the phone, I told him to come by. Even if just for a short coffee. I mean, he never failed to mention how sad it was we saw each other so rarely. He always pointed out how he was dependent on being driven by SO, and how he preferred to be invited instead of just showing up - regardless of the many, many invites he declined for this reason or another, or for my explanations that he was ALWAYS welcome, just to call me with a short heads up as you can imagine being a SAHM with three kids is a very busy job and no guarantee of being home at a given moment.

Then, one day, he off-hand mentioned how he and his SO were over in my town on average once a months, since it happened to be his SO's birth town. And when I incredulously asked him why he never came by for an even short visit, he just mentioned how they ""just had no time for that"". 

At that moment my kid interjected with a ""I didn't know the last part."" No, I didn't tell them that. They already didn't have a relationship with this ""grandpa"" as it was, why poison the well further? 

But I had to still drink from that poisoned well. In a way, it was reassuring. Because his disinterest wasn't personal, he just didn't care for kids, he tried to be polite, tried to look like he engaged, but didn't really care for the connection. Which didn't keep him from complaining about the lack of engagement on my side to my brother.   
And he never seemed to realize that, once I turned 18/came of age, I kept aging! I remember him talking to me about state retirement and how that wouldn't be a thing when I finally reached that age, with that air of ""in a long, long time I probably will not see anymore"". He was genuinely surprised when I dryly asked if he really was convinced the social structure of our homecountry would fail so bad in a mere 15, 20 years? He literally sat there, open mouthed, when the truth of me BEING 47 YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME hit him in the face. I mean, it was literally on my birthday family coffee clatch he was invited to.

Anyway, I realized it still hurts. But I also feel like I should be over it, with him being dead for two years now and all this even further in the past. Not like forgotten, but being done with, no surprises here anymore, yep, always suspected it, confirmed now. And it's not like any pain felt would change one iota of the reality of it.

After completing the deceptively cheerful ""Hope Forest,"" players are introduced to what can only be described as the medieval fantasy equivalent of a corporate team-building exercise gone wrong: The Mantuban Mine. Welcome to the next 150 hours of your life, where gray isn't just a color – it's a state of mind. Picture a place where joy goes to die, and repetitive professions become your new best friends. It's like Groundhog Day met a medieval mining simulator, had a baby, and that baby decided to make all your gaming hours feel like mandatory overtime at a pencil-pushing factory.

# Initial Experience: The ""Generous"" Welcome Package

Upon arrival, management graciously provides you with a pickaxe and some flint rocks. How thoughtful! It's like being handed a desk lamp and told to build SpaceX – you've got the tools, but oh boy, are you in for a surprise. Instead of feeling like humanity's first innovative cave dweller about to discover fire, it feels more like Andrew Gower personally reached through your screen and smacked you with a reality check so hard your avatar's ancestors felt it. The starter package might as well come with a note saying, ""Welcome to Pain Town, population: You.""

# The Rift Situation

Pro Tip: Before even considering a mining career, open those rifts. Otherwise, your mining experience will be less ""Hi-ho, hi-ho"" and more ""Oh no, oh no.""

But wait, there's more! For all you newcomers to this delightful experience, here's what they don't tell you in the brochure: You'll need to grind your way to 32 Carpentry in the Hope Forest just to open a banking rift. Without this crucial detail handled, you'll be pulling a Forrest Gump – running back and forth across the map so much that you could probably circumnavigate the game world three times over. At least Forrest got a book deal and a shrimping business out of his running; all you'll get is worn-out virtual shoes and a deep appreciation for fast travel mechanics.

# The Professional Trinity: A Study in Redundancy

The mine offers three ""prestigious"" career paths, and by prestigious, I mean they're about as diverse as vanilla ice cream in three slightly different bowls:

* Bonewright: Ah yes, the noble art of running to stores and banking materials. You'll spend countless hours sprinting between shops and banks like a caffeinated squirrel hoarding nuts for winter. Only instead of nuts, it's bones, and instead of winter, it's forever.
* Blacksmith: For those who thought Bonewright was too exciting, try Blacksmithing! It's exactly the same, but now you're running back and forth with metal instead of bones. Revolutionary, I know. It's like they copied someone's homework but changed a few words to make it look different.
* Stonemason: Just when you thought they couldn't possibly make another profession that involves running to stores and banking materials... SURPRISE! It's like they took the first two professions, used a thesaurus, and said ""What if we make them do it again, but with rocks?""

It's the equivalent of having three different job titles for the person who refills the office coffee machine - ""Beverage Replenishment Specialist,"" ""Caffeine Distribution Engineer,"" and ""Liquid Motivation Coordinator."" They're all doing the same thing: running back and forth like a headless chicken with a gym membership.

The best part? You get to master all three! Because apparently, one mind-numbing running simulator wasn't enough - the game developers decided you needed a triple dose of cardio. It's like they looked at the most boring part of every MMO and said, ""What if we made this the ENTIRE gameplay loop?"" At least marathon runners get a medal at the end. All you get is carpal tunnel and an intimate knowledge of the shortest route between every shop and bank in the game.

# The Quest of Unreasonable Requirements

Picture this: A quest demanding:

* 40 Bonewright
* 60 Blacksmithing
* 46 Stonemason
* 61 Minefighter

This is the equivalent of requiring three Ph.D.s and a black belt in karate to use the office microwave. Guardians and Hammer mages, we feel your pain – two-thirds of these requirements are as useful to you as a chocolate teapot. And let's talk about that 60 Blacksmithing requirement - it's basically the game's way of giving Cryonights a VIP pass while telling everyone else to take a long walk off a short cliff. Hey **Guardians and Hammer mages**, hope you enjoy grinding 60 levels of a skill that's about as useful to you as a screen door on a submarine! It's like being forced to get a degree in underwater basket weaving when all you wanted was to hit things with a hammer.

# The Mining Experience: Choose Your Torture

Welcome to the most exciting part of the mine, where ""exciting"" means choosing between two flavors of mind-numbing boredom!

Option 1: Rock Watching Simulator 2024 Prepare yourself for the thrilling experience of staring at rocks with a respawn rate slower than a sleeping teenager being told to clean their room. You'll spend so much time waiting for rocks to reappear, you'll start giving them names and developing personal relationships with them. ""Oh look, Jimmy the Iron Ore is back! And there's Sally the Silver Vein! But where's Bob the Copper Node? He's usually so punctual..."" By hour five, you'll have written an entire rock soap opera in your head.

Option 2: Shopping Cart Mario Kart If option one isn't quite your style of torture, try our premium ""Push the Cart"" experience! It's like training for the Shopping Cart Olympics, except there's no Olympics, and you're just pushing a cart. Around. And around. And around. The best part? You somehow get mining experience for this! Because apparently, the mine operates on toddler logic - if you're touching anything mine-related, congratulations, you're a miner now! Next thing you know, they'll be giving out mining experience for eating lunch in the cafeteria or taking a nap near the entrance.

But wait, there's more! The cart pushing comes with its own special brand of existential crisis. You'll find yourself asking deep philosophical questions like:

* ""If I push a minecart but nobody is around to see it, did I really waste my time?""
* ""How many cart pushes equals one actual mining action?""
* ""If I push this cart long enough, will I transcend to a higher plane of existence?""
* ""Is this what my character dreamed of when they decided to become an adventurer?""

The truly magnificent part is that both options somehow manage to make watching paint dry seem like an X-games sport. You'll develop a new appreciation for the concept of time itself, as minutes stretch into hours, and hours stretch into ""Oh god, is the sun rising already?""

P.S. I made this section unnecessarily long and drawn out because I wanted you to feel exactly what it's like to level mining in this game. If you thought reading this was tedious, just wait until you're actually doing it!

**The Tentacle Situation**

As if the mining wasn't challenging enough, there are tentacles. Yes, you read that right - TENTACLES. Emerging from the ground like some budget Lovecraftian horror movie where all the special effects money went to the coffee budget instead. These lovely appendages spring up from the earth, apparently having decided that watching you suffer through mining wasn't entertaining enough - now they want a piece of the action too.

The best part? The game's pathing system is about as sophisticated as a rock with googly eyes. There's no way to plot your course - you're just out there raw-dogging it through tentacle territory like it's your first day at Octopus Navigation School. It's like playing ""The Floor is Lava"" except the floor is actually ""Surprise Attack Tentacles,"" and instead of jumping on furniture, you're just accepting your fate as tentacle bait.

Want to walk from point A to point B? Too bad! Hope you enjoy playing ""Tentacle Roulette"" where every step could turn into an impromptu dance with a ground-dwelling appendage that woke up and chose violence. The developers looked at this and thought, ""You know what would make this grind better? Random tentacle attacks! And let's make sure there's absolutely no way to plan your route around them. That'll be fun!""

Remember those Choose Your Own Adventure books? This is more like ""Choose Your Own Misadventure: Tentacle Edition"" where every choice leads to the same outcome - you, running around like a headless chicken, trying to avoid getting slapped by an overly enthusiastic underground tentacle while carrying your hard-earned minerals.

**Final Verdict**

The Mantuban Mine isn't just a mine – it's a masterclass in patience, perseverance, and questioning your life choices. It's where hope goes to get pickaxed and dreams go to push minecarts.

My relationship with my younger sister, Layla, took a dark turn around early 2020. I was 20, and she was 16. Up until then, things were relatively normal between us, but it felt like something shifted in her almost overnight. Her behavior became erratic, harmful, and unpredictable. I’ve often wondered if she experienced some sort of trauma that she hasn’t shared, but whatever the root cause, she began directing her frustration and anger toward me.

Layla started invading my privacy in ways that left me feeling violated and helpless. She would steal my belongings—sometimes blatantly—and go through my things without hesitation. What made it even more infuriating was that she blamed my mom for her actions, as if to deflect responsibility. One particular incident that stands out is when she began taking my expensive perfumes. I had already given her permission to use them because I wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict, but it seemed like she took advantage of my generosity just to spite me.

To protect my belongings, I installed a lock on my door. Even then, I made the mistake of trusting her enough to share the code, not realizing she was the very person I needed protection from. Her behavior escalated in ways that made me feel powerless. She began taking my clothes—especially the ones my mom disapproved of, like crop tops and jeans—and either wearing them herself or destroying them. One time, she cut my jeans into shorts and tried to claim that I’d given them to her like that. Confronting my mom about these incidents wasn’t an option because I knew I’d get in trouble for owning those items in the first place.

The situation with Layla spilled over into other aspects of my life. During COVID, my older sister Mariam and I started a dessert business. It was something we were both passionate about and a rare bright spot in a dark time. We stayed up countless nights perfecting recipes and creating desserts, and the business was thriving. But Layla found a way to ruin that too. She began deliberately breaking the desserts we worked so hard to make, sometimes right before we were about to deliver them. Her actions were so disruptive that we had to shut the business down entirely. It wasn’t just about the loss of income; it felt like she was sabotaging one of the few things I was proud of.

Our home life became unbearable. The constant tension led to explosive fights almost every night. Mariam and I tried to make our parents see what Layla was doing, but they dismissed it. They didn’t take her actions seriously or hold her accountable, which left me feeling completely unsupported. Every evening seemed to end with us yelling in the living room, desperately trying to be heard, but the situation never improved.

The fights reached a boiling point, and eventually, both Mariam and I were kicked out of the house. Looking back, I can’t help but feel that Layla’s behavior was the catalyst for everything falling apart. The experience left me deeply hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned with my family.

Part 2: A Family in Crisis

Toward the end of 2020, things took an even darker turn. One night, my dad appeared to have a medical emergency. It seemed like a heart attack or seizure—his body was convulsing, he was foaming at the mouth, and he was struggling to breathe. Mariam and I ran downstairs to find my mom, Layla, and my brother, Adam, just sitting there, watching him as if they were in a trance. They hadn’t called an ambulance.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. For what must have been five minutes, they just watched him suffer. Mariam and I immediately sprang into action, calling for help while the rest of my family stood by and did nothing. It was surreal and deeply unsettling to witness their indifference during such a critical moment.

You’d think this event would have been a wake-up call for our family, a moment to put our differences aside and come together. But that didn’t happen. The fights continued as if nothing had changed.

Part 3: Becoming the Black Sheep

Not long after, I finally managed to buy a car. It felt like a small victory, a sign that things might start looking up. For a brief moment, I allowed myself to feel hopeful.

But my family has always had a way of pulling me back into the chaos. I’ve been branded as the black sheep for as long as I can remember, even as a child. Whenever fights broke out, I was the one blamed, regardless of the circumstances. It didn’t matter who started it or what the issue was; the conclusion was always the same—I was the problem.

This dynamic has left me feeling isolated and misunderstood. It’s as though no matter how hard I try to navigate these relationships or prove my worth, I’ll always be seen through this distorted lens.

Part 4: Running Away to Turkey

In early 2021, I turned 21, but my life was anything but celebratory. The constant fighting at home had become unbearable. Every day felt like a battle, and I reached a breaking point. Desperate for peace, I decided to run away to Turkey, hoping to escape the chaos and find some semblance of calm. I stayed there for five months, but my time in Turkey brought its own set of challenges—ones that were deeply traumatic and left lasting scars.

Back home, Layla’s behavior only worsened in my absence. She continued her destructive patterns, cutting the cord to an expensive coffee machine we had and breaking Mariam’s laptop. My dad’s health also took a turn for the worse again, and even though I was miles away, the dysfunction I had tried to leave behind still loomed over me. I couldn’t help but feel responsible, blaming Layla for forcing me into this position.

While I was in Turkey, things went from bad to worse. I found myself in incredibly dangerous situations where I was nearly raped and attacked multiple times. The fear and helplessness I experienced during those moments were overwhelming. I kept thinking about how none of this would have happened if Layla hadn’t made home life so unbearable that I felt I had no choice but to leave.

The emotional toll of Turkey didn’t end there. The worst part of my time away was discovering that my mom, the person who should have been my greatest source of love and support, had been going around wishing and praying for my death. Hearing this crushed me. It confirmed all the feelings of rejection and abandonment I’d carried for years.

As if things couldn’t get more complicated, I was also robbed of $2,000 by a girl who pretended to be my friend. She gained my trust, only to betray me in one of the most vulnerable periods of my life. After robbing me, she went a step further and messaged inappropriate things to my friends—and even to my dad. It was humiliating and horrifying, adding another layer of betrayal to an already unbearable situation.

Despite the chaos, I made one decision for myself during that time: I got a nose job while I was there. It was one of the few things I did that felt like it was for me and no one else, though it didn’t make up for the rest of the hardships I endured.

By the time I returned from Turkey, my PTSD and anxiety were at an all-time high. The weight of what I’d experienced—both back home and during my time away—was suffocating. I came back not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had nowhere else to go. Turkey was supposed to be my escape, but it turned into another nightmare that left me even more broken than before.

Part 5: The Continued Trauma of 2022

By 2022, the chaos in my life persisted, dominated by Layla’s relentless harassment, theft, and physical abuse. Her behavior had reached a point where I couldn’t find a single moment of peace. Adding to this already unbearable situation, my older sister, Mariam, went through a traumatic breakup with her boyfriend of five years in February. Although they reconciled after just a week, the emotional fallout from the breakup created a new layer of turmoil in my life.

The Dynamic with Mariam

During this time, I found myself taking on an overwhelming amount of responsibility in our shared household. I cooked every meal for both Mariam and me, and her only job was to wash the dishes afterward. But more often than not, she wouldn’t clean up, leaving the dishes to pile up and the house in chaos. This neglect escalated the already tense atmosphere in our family. My mom, rather than holding Mariam accountable, would pray for bad things to happen to both of us, directing her anger at me as though I were to blame for everything.

Mariam, still dealing with her own emotional pain from her relationship struggles, took her frustration out on me. It felt like I was a punching bag for everyone’s rage. To make things worse, Mariam frequently found ways to waste my money, often in thoughtless or careless ways.

One recurring issue was the laundry. Mariam ruined countless clothes by bleaching them or handling them irresponsibly. I took on almost all the household responsibilities—I cared for the cat, did the laundry, cleaned the house, and cooked—but it never seemed enough. Every task I completed was overshadowed by her careless actions, which drained both my energy and my finances.

The breaking point came after a series of escalating conflicts. We had gone on a vacation together earlier that year, but two days into the trip, Mariam decided she wanted to go home. It was an infuriating waste of money and effort, and I felt completely disrespected. Later, a seemingly small incident pushed me over the edge: Mariam told me the wrong date for a Sephora return, which led me to believe I had lost an additional $400. I was at work when I realized what happened, and in my frustration, I texted her to get out of the house.

Mariam had already signed a lease for a new place, with her move-in date just a month away, but she hadn’t told our parents about her plans. She used my text as an excuse to paint the narrative that I had kicked her out of the house, even though it wasn’t my house to begin with. This marked the point of no return in our relationship. The resentment, misunderstandings, and constant financial strain had piled up to a breaking point.

The Vancouver Trip

In October 2022, Mariam and I attempted to salvage our relationship by going on another trip together, this time to Vancouver. But instead of healing, the trip brought more tension. Mariam’s financial problems meant she couldn’t afford to do much on the trip, which made everything feel strained. On top of that, she spent much of the trip crying over her boyfriend, who she was still having constant problems with.

It felt like history repeating itself: why agree to go on a vacation if you’re just going to spend it upset and unable to enjoy anything? I couldn’t help but feel that, once again, my money and effort were being wasted. The trip, instead of bringing us closer, only deepened the resentment between us.

The Breaking Point with Layla

In December 2022, Layla’s behavior escalated to outright violence. One day, she hit me out of nowhere. It wasn’t just a random act of aggression; it was the culmination of years of abuse and torment. I was shaken, angry, and exhausted. I finally realized that I couldn’t take it anymore.

I called Mariam, desperate for support, but her closeness to Layla felt like the ultimate betrayal. How could she stay so close to someone who had repeatedly assaulted me and made my life a living hell? That was the moment I decided to cut Mariam off completely. Her refusal to acknowledge the impact of Layla’s abuse, combined with her own treatment of me, was too much to bear.

This year was a breaking point in so many ways—emotionally, financially, and physically. The relationships I once hoped would provide me with comfort and stability became sources of pain and exhaustion. Cutting ties with Mariam felt like a necessary step for my own survival, even if it was heartbreaking. My world felt smaller and lonelier, but I knew I couldn’t keep sacrificing my well-being for people who didn’t value me.

Part 6: Isolation and Uneasy Reconciliations

By December 2022, the isolation in my family dynamics became even more pronounced. Mariam constantly invited everyone—our cousins, mutual friends, and family—over to her house. I, however, was never invited. This exclusion created a deep sense of loneliness and alienation. I felt disconnected from the people I cared about, as they naturally gravitated to Mariam’s space.

When I tried to bridge the gap by inviting people over to my house, it rarely worked out. Mariam would often show up despite the tension between us, making the gatherings uncomfortable. I’d spend time and money preparing food, hoping to foster connection, only to feel undermined by her presence. It left me questioning why I even bothered.

Part 7: A Shared Breakup and a Fragile Bond

In February 2023, Mariam and I both experienced breakups within days of each other. It was an unexpected turning point. The shared heartbreak brought us closer together. We found solace in each other’s company, leaning on one another in a way we hadn’t in years.

For a time, things felt okay between us. Despite the underlying tension and unresolved issues, there was a sense of camaraderie born out of mutual pain.

Part 8: A Summer of Respite

The summer of 2023 provided a rare break from the usual chaos. Layla, my mom, and my youngest sister, Amal, went away for the entire summer. Their absence brought some much-needed relief, but it didn’t eliminate all the tension.

Even from a distance, Layla continued to stir up conflict. She would make incendiary comments in the family group chat, often targeting me. My brother, Adam, and Amal would join in, piling on and turning every conversation into an attack. When I defended myself, I was painted as the bad person, the instigator, even though I was simply standing up for myself.

Despite these challenges, Mariam and I maintained a good relationship over the summer. There was still some lingering resentment on both sides—remnants of past conflicts—but we managed to keep things civil, even though we bickered occasionally.

Part 9: A Tumultuous Fall

By November 2023, Layla’s behavior escalated again. She became physically violent toward me once more, a painful reminder that little had changed. The cycle of abuse felt never-ending, and I couldn’t see a way out of it.

At the same time, my relationship with Mariam remained relatively stable. We weren’t as close as we had been after our breakups, but we were okay—cordial, if not completely harmonious.

Part 10: Overwhelmed by Everyone

By this time, I was in a committed relationship, which provided a glimmer of stability amidst the chaos. But other dynamics in my life were becoming overwhelming.

With everything happening in the world, my cousins and I became deeply trauma-bonded. They started coming over to my house constantly—so often that it felt like they were there 24/7. While I cherished the connection we shared, it came with its own challenges.

I found myself cooking and cleaning for everyone, providing meals and hospitality without any acknowledgment or gratitude. Every visit felt like a drain on my resources—emotional, physical, and financial. I was paying for everyone’s food, cleaning up after them, and putting in effort that no one seemed to notice. It left me feeling unappreciated and exhausted.

Part 11: Summer 2024 – The Cottage Trip

In the summer of 2024, all my girl cousins, my sisters, and I went to a cottage together. At first, I thought it would be a fun, relaxing getaway, but it quickly became one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.

By default, I became the chef for the entire group—nine people in total. Every single meal was my responsibility. I cooked, cleaned, and handled everything while everyone else lounged around. No one offered to help, and when I asked for assistance, I was met with dismissive shrugs or disrespectful “pfft” responses.

The tension kept building throughout the trip. It was clear that I was being taken advantage of, and I was fuming. It wasn’t just the cooking and cleaning; I had also done the bulk of the grocery shopping for the trip, which was another burden that no one else had really stepped up to share. Only Noor, Tasnim, and Dania, my cousins, helped in small ways, but even their efforts couldn’t offset the overwhelming workload.

The Garden Party

One of the biggest highlights—or what should have been the highlight—of the trip was a dinner party Noor and I planned called the Garden Party. I had spent weeks preparing for it, putting in so much effort to make it special. I bought decorations, fresh flowers, and thrifted unique pieces to create the perfect ambiance. I spent hours cooking multiple dishes and even did everyone’s hair and makeup to ensure they felt as elegant as the setting I had created.

From the beginning, Mariam made it clear that she didn’t care about the party. She didn’t want to spend extra money on it and showed zero interest in the event. I accepted that, but I couldn’t have predicted how her attitude would escalate once the party began.

When the dinner started, Noor and I wanted to take pictures with the setup we had worked so hard on. It was only natural—we had planned the entire thing, and we wanted to capture the beautiful results of our efforts. We spent just a few minutes snapping some cute photos.

Despite her earlier indifference, Mariam suddenly threw a tantrum about not getting any good pictures of herself. She complained that the photos of her were blurry or unflattering and made a huge scene. Her outburst ruined the mood of the party. It wasn’t just frustrating—it was devastating.

Mariam’s tantrum turned something that was supposed to be meaningful and joyful into a selfish spectacle. She had openly said she didn’t care about the party, yet she hijacked the moment and made it all about her. To make matters worse, her outburst left me with just a few blurry, rushed photos of myself, taken in the span of five minutes, while she demanded more attention for her pictures.

The Aftermath

By the time the cottage trip was over, I was livid. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much time, money, and effort I had poured into making the trip and the Garden Party special, only for it to be completely ruined.

No one thanked me for the meals, the planning, or the countless hours I spent trying to make everything perfect. Instead, I was treated like an unpaid servant, and the people I cared about acted like spoiled brats. Mariam’s behavior during the party was the final straw—it felt like a slap in the face after all the work I had done.

Looking back, this trip left me feeling used, unappreciated, and disrespected. What should have been a cherished memory turned into yet another reminder of how much I give to the people around me, only to have it go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Part 12: The Fallout After the Cottage

Following the cottage trip in June 2024, my relationship with Mariam hit an all-time low. We didn’t speak for a month or two after the trip—I was so angry at her for ruining the Garden Party and, by extension, the entire experience for me. My frustration ran deep, and the silence between us felt necessary for me to process everything. Meanwhile, my tension with Layla only escalated, adding to the turmoil in my life.

Mariam’s Short-Lived Relationship and My Solo Trip

By late August, Mariam found herself in the throes of another breakup. She had been in a short two-month relationship with a guy who was clearly still in love with his ex. The situation left her emotionally shattered. Her anxiety and depression from the breakup were so severe that she lost over 10 pounds.

At the same time, I had my own struggles and decided to take a solo trip to Oregon. I needed space—not just from Mariam but from everything happening at home. While I couldn’t be there for her in person during this difficult time, I wanted to make sure she felt supported. I asked my boyfriend to check in on her, call her, and be there for her as much as he could in my absence.

Zuzu’s Health Declines

While dealing with Mariam’s breakup from afar, I was also facing a heartbreaking situation with Zuzu. By the end of July, Zuzu began having serious health problems, which worsened in early August, necessitating surgery. Even after the surgery, she wasn’t doing well, and I found myself constantly monitoring her condition—checking on her almost ten times an hour to ensure she was okay.

What made this even harder was Layla’s abusive behavior toward Zuzu. She went out of her way to make the environment uncomfortable and unsafe for her. Layla would turn the room freezing cold, even when she wasn’t there, seemingly just to “freeze out” Zuzu. It was cruel and infuriating, and it added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Part 13: The Breaking Point

In October 2024, Layla’s violence escalated to an unimaginable level. She completely lost control, attacking me and leaving deep cuts all over my neck. I was in shock and utterly distraught, my body physically marked by her cruelty and my spirit crushed by the emotional weight of the situation

Part 13: The Breaking Point (continued)

Desperate for support, I called Nina, someone I had always trusted and considered a pillar of support. Initially, she listened as I cried and poured out my feelings, but within minutes, it felt as though she stopped believing me. Despite being able to see the cuts on my neck, her demeanor shifted, and she began questioning the severity of what I was telling her. The experience left me feeling gaslit, as though my pain and trauma weren’t valid.

Seeking solace elsewhere, I called Mariam, furious and broken. I yelled at her, telling her I couldn’t keep speaking to her if she continued to remain close to Layla. Her alliance with someone who had caused me so much pain felt like the ultimate betrayal. I told her she had to make a choice: stand with me or with Layla. She refused to respond definitively, leaving me even more devastated.

November 14: The Birthday Dinner

As Layla’s birthday dinner approached on November 15, it became yet another point of contention. The chosen restaurant was one I loved and had been planning to visit with my cousins for months. I asked them not to go to this specific place, explaining that I couldn’t afford to go again if they did, as it would ruin the experience for me. My request was misunderstood—they thought I was asking them not to celebrate Layla’s birthday at all.

The situation spiraled out of control in our group chat. Nina, Mariam, and Tara immediately jumped to Layla’s defense, downplaying my concerns and making me feel like I was overreacting. Their defense of her felt like a direct invalidation of everything I had endured. Overwhelmed with frustration and disbelief, I left the group chat.

The Call with Nina

After leaving the chat, Nina called me, and I broke down. I begged her to acknowledge how terrible Layla had been—not just to me, but in general. While Nina admitted that Layla’s actions toward me were horrible, she refused to say that Layla was a horrible person. Her reasoning was that if she labeled Layla as such but still chose to hang out with her, it would make her feel fake or fraudulent.

Her logic devastated me. I couldn’t understand how someone who claimed to care about me could still choose to stand by Layla. I told Nina exactly how I felt—that her actions were phony and hypocritical. How could I trust someone who wouldn’t stand firmly by my side? This realization left me questioning the depth of our relationship.

In a final act of severing trust, I removed Nina from being able to see my location.

November 15: The Birthday Dinner

The next day, Layla’s birthday dinner went ahead as planned. Mariam went all out, even getting her a custom cake. Seeing their celebration wasn’t just painful—it was deeply symbolic of how little my suffering mattered to them.

Adding to the sting, Mariam moved a family gathering that was originally supposed to happen at my parents’ house to her own place. It was a calculated decision, one that excluded me entirely, knowing I wouldn’t be invited. The deliberate nature of these actions left me feeling more isolated than ever.

November 17: The Gathering

Tonight, as Mariam hosts this gathering at her house, I feel nothing but betrayal. Everyone who I had supported—cooking for them, hosting them, being there for them—is at her house, laughing and spending time together, while I’m left out entirely.

They’ve shown me time and again that they will side with Layla, dismissing the years of abuse and torment she has inflicted on me. It’s a profound and painful realization: my pain, my voice, my presence—they don’t matter to the people I once considered my closest circle.

Reflection

For me, this situation is black and white: you cannot stay neutral. If my cousins and Mariam choose to remain close to Layla, they cannot remain close to me. The years of torment, violence, and pain Layla has caused me are too severe to ignore. Their refusal to choose, or even acknowledge the depth of my suffering, is a betrayal I cannot overlook.

Right now, I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my cousins, my friends. The people I’ve given so much to have let me down in the most profound way. I am alone, and the heartbreak of their betrayal feels heavier than I ever thought possible.

Toward the end of 2020, things took an even darker turn. One night, my dad appeared to have a medical emergency. It seemed like a heart attack or seizure—his body was convulsing, he was foaming at the mouth, and he was struggling to breathe. Mariam and I ran downstairs to find my mom, Layla, and my brother, Adam, just sitting there, watching him as if they were in a trance. They hadn’t called an ambulance.

Part 4: Running Away to Turkey

In early 2021, I turned 21, but my life was anything but celebratory. The constant fighting at home had become unbearable. Every day felt like a battle, and I reached a breaking point. Desperate for peace, I decided to run away to Turkey, hoping to escape the chaos and find some semblance of calm. I stayed there for five months, but my time in Turkey brought its own set of challenges—ones that were deeply traumatic and left lasting scars.

Back home, Layla’s behavior only worsened in my absence. She continued her destructive patterns, cutting the cord to an expensive coffee machine we had and breaking Mariam’s laptop. My dad’s health also took a turn for the worse again, and even though I was miles away, the dysfunction I had tried to leave behind still loomed over me. I couldn’t help but feel responsible, blaming Layla for forcing me into this position.

While I was in Turkey, things went from bad to worse. I found myself in incredibly dangerous situations where I was nearly raped and attacked multiple times. The fear and helplessness I experienced during those moments were overwhelming. I kept thinking about how none of this would have happened if Layla hadn’t made home life so unbearable that I felt I had no choice but to leave.

The emotional toll of Turkey didn’t end there. The worst part of my time away was discovering that my mom, the person who should have been my greatest source of love and support, had been going around wishing and praying for my death. Hearing this crushed me. It confirmed all the feelings of rejection and abandonment I’d carried for years.

As if things couldn’t get more complicated, I was also robbed of $2,000 by a girl who pretended to be my friend. She gained my trust, only to betray me in one of the most vulnerable periods of my life. After robbing me, she went a step further and messaged inappropriate things to my friends—and even to my dad. It was humiliating and horrifying, adding another layer of betrayal to an already unbearable situation.

Despite the chaos, I made one decision for myself during that time: I got a nose job while I was there. It was one of the few things I did that felt like it was for me and no one else, though it didn’t make up for the rest of the hardships I endured.

By the time I returned from Turkey, my PTSD and anxiety were at an all-time high. The weight of what I’d experienced—both back home and during my time away—was suffocating. I came back not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had nowhere else to go. Turkey was supposed to be my escape, but it turned into another nightmare that left me even more broken than before.

Part 5: The Continued Trauma of 2022

By 2022, the chaos in my life persisted, dominated by Layla’s relentless harassment, theft, and physical abuse. Her behavior had reached a point where I couldn’t find a single moment of peace. Adding to this already unbearable situation, my older sister, Mariam, went through a traumatic breakup with her boyfriend of five years in February. Although they reconciled after just a week, the emotional fallout from the breakup created a new layer of turmoil in my life.

The Dynamic with Mariam

During this time, I found myself taking on an overwhelming amount of responsibility in our shared household. I cooked every meal for both Mariam and me, and her only job was to wash the dishes afterward. But more often than not, she wouldn’t clean up, leaving the dishes to pile up and the house in chaos. This neglect escalated the already tense atmosphere in our family. My mom, rather than holding Mariam accountable, would pray for bad things to happen to both of us, directing her anger at me as though I were to blame for everything.

Mariam, still dealing with her own emotional pain from her relationship struggles, took her frustration out on me. It felt like I was a punching bag for everyone’s rage. To make things worse, Mariam frequently found ways to waste my money, often in thoughtless or careless ways.

One recurring issue was the laundry. Mariam ruined countless clothes by bleaching them or handling them irresponsibly. I took on almost all the household responsibilities—I cared for the cat, did the laundry, cleaned the house, and cooked—but it never seemed enough. Every task I completed was overshadowed by her careless actions, which drained both my energy and my finances.

The breaking point came after a series of escalating conflicts. We had gone on a vacation together earlier that year, but two days into the trip, Mariam decided she wanted to go home. It was an infuriating waste of money and effort, and I felt completely disrespected. Later, a seemingly small incident pushed me over the edge: Mariam told me the wrong date for a Sephora return, which led me to believe I had lost an additional $400. I was at work when I realized what happened, and in my frustration, I texted her to get out of the house.

Mariam had already signed a lease for a new place, with her move-in date just a month away, but she hadn’t told our parents about her plans. She used my text as an excuse to paint the narrative that I had kicked her out of the house, even though it wasn’t my house to begin with. This marked the point of no return in our relationship. The resentment, misunderstandings, and constant financial strain had piled up to a breaking point.

The Vancouver Trip

In October 2022, Mariam and I attempted to salvage our relationship by going on another trip together, this time to Vancouver. But instead of healing, the trip brought more tension. Mariam’s financial problems meant she couldn’t afford to do much on the trip, which made everything feel strained. On top of that, she spent much of the trip crying over her boyfriend, who she was still having constant problems with.

It felt like history repeating itself: why agree to go on a vacation if you’re just going to spend it upset and unable to enjoy anything? I couldn’t help but feel that, once again, my money and effort were being wasted. The trip, instead of bringing us closer, only deepened the resentment between us.

The Breaking Point with Layla

In December 2022, Layla’s behavior escalated to outright violence. One day, she hit me out of nowhere. It wasn’t just a random act of aggression; it was the culmination of years of abuse and torment. I was shaken, angry, and exhausted. I finally realized that I couldn’t take it anymore.

I called Mariam, desperate for support, but her closeness to Layla felt like the ultimate betrayal. How could she stay so close to someone who had repeatedly assaulted me and made my life a living hell? That was the moment I decided to cut Mariam off completely. Her refusal to acknowledge the impact of Layla’s abuse, combined with her own treatment of me, was too much to bear.

This year was a breaking point in so many ways—emotionally, financially, and physically. The relationships I once hoped would provide me with comfort and stability became sources of pain and exhaustion. Cutting ties with Mariam felt like a necessary step for my own survival, even if it was heartbreaking. My world felt smaller and lonelier, but I knew I couldn’t keep sacrificing my well-being for people who didn’t value me.

Part 6: Isolation and Uneasy Reconciliations

By December 2022, the isolation in my family dynamics became even more pronounced. Mariam constantly invited everyone—our cousins, mutual friends, and family—over to her house. I, however, was never invited. This exclusion created a deep sense of loneliness and alienation. I felt disconnected from the people I cared about, as they naturally gravitated to Mariam’s space.

When I tried to bridge the gap by inviting people over to my house, it rarely worked out. Mariam would often show up despite the tension between us, making the gatherings uncomfortable. I’d spend time and money preparing food, hoping to foster connection, only to feel undermined by her presence. It left me questioning why I even bothered.

Part 7: A Shared Breakup and a Fragile Bond

In February 2023, Mariam and I both experienced breakups within days of each other. It was an unexpected turning point. The shared heartbreak brought us closer together. We found solace in each other’s company, leaning on one another in a way we hadn’t in years.

For a time, things felt okay between us. Despite the underlying tension and unresolved issues, there was a sense of camaraderie born out of mutual pain.

Part 8: A Summer of Respite

The summer of 2023 provided a rare break from the usual chaos. Layla, my mom, and my youngest sister, Amal, went away for the entire summer. Their absence brought some much-needed relief, but it didn’t eliminate all the tension.

Even from a distance, Layla continued to stir up conflict. She would make incendiary comments in the family group chat, often targeting me. My brother, Adam, and Amal would join in, piling on and turning every conversation into an attack. When I defended myself, I was painted as the bad person, the instigator, even though I was simply standing up for myself.

Despite these challenges, Mariam and I maintained a good relationship over the summer. There was still some lingering resentment on both sides—remnants of past conflicts—but we managed to keep things civil, even though we bickered occasionally.

Part 9: A Tumultuous Fall

By November 2023, Layla’s behavior escalated again. She became physically violent toward me once more, a painful reminder that little had changed. The cycle of abuse felt never-ending, and I couldn’t see a way out of it.

At the same time, my relationship with Mariam remained relatively stable. We weren’t as close as we had been after our breakups, but we were okay—cordial, if not completely harmonious.

Part 10: Overwhelmed by Everyone

By this time, I was in a committed relationship, which provided a glimmer of stability amidst the chaos. But other dynamics in my life were becoming overwhelming.

With everything happening in the world, my cousins and I became deeply trauma-bonded. They started coming over to my house constantly—so often that it felt like they were there 24/7. While I cherished the connection we shared, it came with its own challenges.

I found myself cooking and cleaning for everyone, providing meals and hospitality without any acknowledgment or gratitude. Every visit felt like a drain on my resources—emotional, physical, and financial. I was paying for everyone’s food, cleaning up after them, and putting in effort that no one seemed to notice. It left me feeling unappreciated and exhausted.

Part 11: Summer 2024 – The Cottage Trip

In the summer of 2024, all my girl cousins, my sisters, and I went to a cottage together. At first, I thought it would be a fun, relaxing getaway, but it quickly became one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.

By default, I became the chef for the entire group—nine people in total. Every single meal was my responsibility. I cooked, cleaned, and handled everything while everyone else lounged around. No one offered to help, and when I asked for assistance, I was met with dismissive shrugs or disrespectful “pfft” responses.

The tension kept building throughout the trip. It was clear that I was being taken advantage of, and I was fuming. It wasn’t just the cooking and cleaning; I had also done the bulk of the grocery shopping for the trip, which was another burden that no one else had really stepped up to share. Only Noor, Tasnim, and Dania, my cousins, helped in small ways, but even their efforts couldn’t offset the overwhelming workload.

The Garden Party

One of the biggest highlights—or what should have been the highlight—of the trip was a dinner party Noor and I planned called the Garden Party. I had spent weeks preparing for it, putting in so much effort to make it special. I bought decorations, fresh flowers, and thrifted unique pieces to create the perfect ambiance. I spent hours cooking multiple dishes and even did everyone’s hair and makeup to ensure they felt as elegant as the setting I had created.

From the beginning, Mariam made it clear that she didn’t care about the party. She didn’t want to spend extra money on it and showed zero interest in the event. I accepted that, but I couldn’t have predicted how her attitude would escalate once the party began.

When the dinner started, Noor and I wanted to take pictures with the setup we had worked so hard on. It was only natural—we had planned the entire thing, and we wanted to capture the beautiful results of our efforts. We spent just a few minutes snapping some cute photos.

Despite her earlier indifference, Mariam suddenly threw a tantrum about not getting any good pictures of herself. She complained that the photos of her were blurry or unflattering and made a huge scene. Her outburst ruined the mood of the party. It wasn’t just frustrating—it was devastating.

Mariam’s tantrum turned something that was supposed to be meaningful and joyful into a selfish spectacle. She had openly said she didn’t care about the party, yet she hijacked the moment and made it all about her. To make matters worse, her outburst left me with just a few blurry, rushed photos of myself, taken in the span of five minutes, while she demanded more attention for her pictures.

The Aftermath

By the time the cottage trip was over, I was livid. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much time, money, and effort I had poured into making the trip and the Garden Party special, only for it to be completely ruined.

No one thanked me for the meals, the planning, or the countless hours I spent trying to make everything perfect. Instead, I was treated like an unpaid servant, and the people I cared about acted like spoiled brats. Mariam’s behavior during the party was the final straw—it felt like a slap in the face after all the work I had done.

Looking back, this trip left me feeling used, unappreciated, and disrespected. What should have been a cherished memory turned into yet another reminder of how much I give to the people around me, only to have it go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Part 12: The Fallout After the Cottage

Following the cottage trip in June 2024, my relationship with Mariam hit an all-time low. We didn’t speak for a month or two after the trip—I was so angry at her for ruining the Garden Party and, by extension, the entire experience for me. My frustration ran deep, and the silence between us felt necessary for me to process everything. Meanwhile, my tension with Layla only escalated, adding to the turmoil in my life.

Mariam’s Short-Lived Relationship and My Solo Trip

By late August, Mariam found herself in the throes of another breakup. She had been in a short two-month relationship with a guy who was clearly still in love with his ex. The situation left her emotionally shattered. Her anxiety and depression from the breakup were so severe that she lost over 10 pounds.

At the same time, I had my own struggles and decided to take a solo trip to Oregon. I needed space—not just from Mariam but from everything happening at home. While I couldn’t be there for her in person during this difficult time, I wanted to make sure she felt supported. I asked my boyfriend to check in on her, call her, and be there for her as much as he could in my absence.

Zuzu’s Health Declines

While dealing with Mariam’s breakup from afar, I was also facing a heartbreaking situation with Zuzu. By the end of July, Zuzu began having serious health problems, which worsened in early August, necessitating surgery. Even after the surgery, she wasn’t doing well, and I found myself constantly monitoring her condition—checking on her almost ten times an hour to ensure she was okay.

What made this even harder was Layla’s abusive behavior toward Zuzu. She went out of her way to make the environment uncomfortable and unsafe for her. Layla would turn the room freezing cold, even when she wasn’t there, seemingly just to “freeze out” Zuzu. It was cruel and infuriating, and it added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Part 13: The Breaking Point

In October 2024, Layla’s violence escalated to an unimaginable level. She completely lost control, attacking me and leaving deep cuts all over my neck. I was in shock and utterly distraught, my body physically marked by her cruelty and my spirit crushed by the emotional weight of the situation

Part 13: The Breaking Point (continued)

Desperate for support, I called Nina, someone I had always trusted and considered a pillar of support. Initially, she listened as I cried and poured out my feelings, but within minutes, it felt as though she stopped believing me. Despite being able to see the cuts on my neck, her demeanor shifted, and she began questioning the severity of what I was telling her. The experience left me feeling gaslit, as though my pain and trauma weren’t valid.

Seeking solace elsewhere, I called Mariam, furious and broken. I yelled at her, telling her I couldn’t keep speaking to her if she continued to remain close to Layla. Her alliance with someone who had caused me so much pain felt like the ultimate betrayal. I told her she had to make a choice: stand with me or with Layla. She refused to respond definitively, leaving me even more devastated.

November 14: The Birthday Dinner

As Layla’s birthday dinner approached on November 15, it became yet another point of contention. The chosen restaurant was one I loved and had been planning to visit with my cousins for months. I asked them not to go to this specific place, explaining that I couldn’t afford to go again if they did, as it would ruin the experience for me. My request was misunderstood—they thought I was asking them not to celebrate Layla’s birthday at all.

The situation spiraled out of control in our group chat. Nina, Mariam, and Tara immediately jumped to Layla’s defense, downplaying my concerns and making me feel like I was overreacting. Their defense of her felt like a direct invalidation of everything I had endured. Overwhelmed with frustration and disbelief, I left the group chat.

The Call with Nina

After leaving the chat, Nina called me, and I broke down. I begged her to acknowledge how terrible Layla had been—not just to me, but in general. While Nina admitted that Layla’s actions toward me were horrible, she refused to say that Layla was a horrible person. Her reasoning was that if she labeled Layla as such but still chose to hang out with her, it would make her feel fake or fraudulent.

Her logic devastated me. I couldn’t understand how someone who claimed to care about me could still choose to stand by Layla. I told Nina exactly how I felt—that her actions were phony and hypocritical. How could I trust someone who wouldn’t stand firmly by my side? This realization left me questioning the depth of our relationship.

In a final act of severing trust, I removed Nina from being able to see my location.

November 15: The Birthday Dinner

The next day, Layla’s birthday dinner went ahead as planned. Mariam went all out, even getting her a custom cake. Seeing their celebration wasn’t just painful—it was deeply symbolic of how little my suffering mattered to them.

Adding to the sting, Mariam moved a family gathering that was originally supposed to happen at my parents’ house to her own place. It was a calculated decision, one that excluded me entirely, knowing I wouldn’t be invited. The deliberate nature of these actions left me feeling more isolated than ever.

November 17: The Gathering

Tonight, as Mariam hosts this gathering at her house, I feel nothing but betrayal. Everyone who I had supported—cooking for them, hosting them, being there for them—is at her house, laughing and spending time together, while I’m left out entirely.

They’ve shown me time and again that they will side with Layla, dismissing the years of abuse and torment she has inflicted on me. It’s a profound and painful realization: my pain, my voice, my presence—they don’t matter to the people I once considered my closest circle.

Reflection

For me, this situation is black and white: you cannot stay neutral. If my cousins and Mariam choose to remain close to Layla, they cannot remain close to me. The years of torment, violence, and pain Layla has caused me are too severe to ignore. Their refusal to choose, or even acknowledge the depth of my suffering, is a betrayal I cannot overlook.

Right now, I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my cousins, my friends. The people I’ve given so much to have let me down in the most profound way. I am alone, and the heartbreak of their betrayal feels heavier than I ever thought possible.

How can I change my life? Moving out isn’t really possible. How can I have everyone back?

My relationship with my younger sister, Layla, took a dark turn around early 2020. I was 20, and she was 16. Up until then, things were relatively normal between us, but it felt like something shifted in her almost overnight. Her behavior became erratic, harmful, and unpredictable. I’ve often wondered if she experienced some sort of trauma that she hasn’t shared, but whatever the root cause, she began directing her frustration and anger toward me.

Layla started invading my privacy in ways that left me feeling violated and helpless. She would steal my belongings—sometimes blatantly—and go through my things without hesitation. What made it even more infuriating was that she blamed my mom for her actions, as if to deflect responsibility. One particular incident that stands out is when she began taking my expensive perfumes. I had already given her permission to use them because I wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict, but it seemed like she took advantage of my generosity just to spite me.

To protect my belongings, I installed a lock on my door. Even then, I made the mistake of trusting her enough to share the code, not realizing she was the very person I needed protection from. Her behavior escalated in ways that made me feel powerless. She began taking my clothes—especially the ones my mom disapproved of, like crop tops and jeans—and either wearing them herself or destroying them. One time, she cut my jeans into shorts and tried to claim that I’d given them to her like that. Confronting my mom about these incidents wasn’t an option because I knew I’d get in trouble for owning those items in the first place.

The situation with Layla spilled over into other aspects of my life. During COVID, my older sister Mariam and I started a dessert business. It was something we were both passionate about and a rare bright spot in a dark time. We stayed up countless nights perfecting recipes and creating desserts, and the business was thriving. But Layla found a way to ruin that too. She began deliberately breaking the desserts we worked so hard to make, sometimes right before we were about to deliver them. Her actions were so disruptive that we had to shut the business down entirely. It wasn’t just about the loss of income; it felt like she was sabotaging one of the few things I was proud of.

Our home life became unbearable. The constant tension led to explosive fights almost every night. Mariam and I tried to make our parents see what Layla was doing, but they dismissed it. They didn’t take her actions seriously or hold her accountable, which left me feeling completely unsupported. Every evening seemed to end with us yelling in the living room, desperately trying to be heard, but the situation never improved.

The fights reached a boiling point, and eventually, both Mariam and I were kicked out of the house. Looking back, I can’t help but feel that Layla’s behavior was the catalyst for everything falling apart. The experience left me deeply hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned with my family.

Part 2: A Family in Crisis

Toward the end of 2020, things took an even darker turn. One night, my dad appeared to have a medical emergency. It seemed like a heart attack or seizure—his body was convulsing, he was foaming at the mouth, and he was struggling to breathe. Mariam and I ran downstairs to find my mom, Layla, and my brother, Adam, just sitting there, watching him as if they were in a trance. They hadn’t called an ambulance.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. For what must have been five minutes, they just watched him suffer. Mariam and I immediately sprang into action, calling for help while the rest of my family stood by and did nothing. It was surreal and deeply unsettling to witness their indifference during such a critical moment.

You’d think this event would have been a wake-up call for our family, a moment to put our differences aside and come together. But that didn’t happen. The fights continued as if nothing had changed.

Part 3: Becoming the Black Sheep

Not long after, I finally managed to buy a car. It felt like a small victory, a sign that things might start looking up. For a brief moment, I allowed myself to feel hopeful.

But my family has always had a way of pulling me back into the chaos. I’ve been branded as the black sheep for as long as I can remember, even as a child. Whenever fights broke out, I was the one blamed, regardless of the circumstances. It didn’t matter who started it or what the issue was; the conclusion was always the same—I was the problem.

This dynamic has left me feeling isolated and misunderstood. It’s as though no matter how hard I try to navigate these relationships or prove my worth, I’ll always be seen through this distorted lens.

Part 4: Running Away to Turkey

In early 2021, I turned 21, but my life was anything but celebratory. The constant fighting at home had become unbearable. Every day felt like a battle, and I reached a breaking point. Desperate for peace, I decided to run away to Turkey, hoping to escape the chaos and find some semblance of calm. I stayed there for five months, but my time in Turkey brought its own set of challenges—ones that were deeply traumatic and left lasting scars.

Back home, Layla’s behavior only worsened in my absence. She continued her destructive patterns, cutting the cord to an expensive coffee machine we had and breaking Mariam’s laptop. My dad’s health also took a turn for the worse again, and even though I was miles away, the dysfunction I had tried to leave behind still loomed over me. I couldn’t help but feel responsible, blaming Layla for forcing me into this position.

While I was in Turkey, things went from bad to worse. I found myself in incredibly dangerous situations where I was nearly raped and attacked multiple times. The fear and helplessness I experienced during those moments were overwhelming. I kept thinking about how none of this would have happened if Layla hadn’t made home life so unbearable that I felt I had no choice but to leave.

The emotional toll of Turkey didn’t end there. The worst part of my time away was discovering that my mom, the person who should have been my greatest source of love and support, had been going around wishing and praying for my death. Hearing this crushed me. It confirmed all the feelings of rejection and abandonment I’d carried for years.

As if things couldn’t get more complicated, I was also robbed of $2,000 by a girl who pretended to be my friend. She gained my trust, only to betray me in one of the most vulnerable periods of my life. After robbing me, she went a step further and messaged inappropriate things to my friends—and even to my dad. It was humiliating and horrifying, adding another layer of betrayal to an already unbearable situation.

Despite the chaos, I made one decision for myself during that time: I got a nose job while I was there. It was one of the few things I did that felt like it was for me and no one else, though it didn’t make up for the rest of the hardships I endured.

By the time I returned from Turkey, my PTSD and anxiety were at an all-time high. The weight of what I’d experienced—both back home and during my time away—was suffocating. I came back not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had nowhere else to go. Turkey was supposed to be my escape, but it turned into another nightmare that left me even more broken than before.

Part 5: The Continued Trauma of 2022

By 2022, the chaos in my life persisted, dominated by Layla’s relentless harassment, theft, and physical abuse. Her behavior had reached a point where I couldn’t find a single moment of peace. Adding to this already unbearable situation, my older sister, Mariam, went through a traumatic breakup with her boyfriend of five years in February. Although they reconciled after just a week, the emotional fallout from the breakup created a new layer of turmoil in my life.

The Vancouver Trip

In October 2022, Mariam and I attempted to salvage our relationship by going on another trip together, this time to Vancouver. But instead of healing, the trip brought more tension. Mariam’s financial problems meant she couldn’t afford to do much on the trip, which made everything feel strained. On top of that, she spent much of the trip crying over her boyfriend, who she was still having constant problems with.

It felt like history repeating itself: why agree to go on a vacation if you’re just going to spend it upset and unable to enjoy anything?

Cutting ties with Mariam felt like a necessary step for my own survival, even if it was heartbreaking. My world felt smaller and lonelier, but I knew I couldn’t keep sacrificing my well-being for people who didn’t value me.

Part 6: Isolation and Uneasy Reconciliations

By December 2022, the isolation in my family dynamics became even more pronounced. Mariam constantly invited everyone—our cousins, mutual friends, and family—over to her house.

Part 10: Overwhelmed by Everyone

By this time, I was in a committed relationship, which provided a glimmer of stability amidst the chaos. But other dynamics in my life were becoming overwhelming.

With everything happening in the world, my cousins and I became deeply trauma-bonded. They started coming over to my house constantly—so often that it felt like they were there 24/7. While I cherished the connection we shared, it came with its own challenges.

I found myself cooking and cleaning for everyone, providing meals and hospitality without any acknowledgment or gratitude. Every visit felt like a drain on my resources—emotional, physical, and financial. I was paying for everyone’s food, cleaning up after them, and putting in effort that no one seemed to notice. It left me feeling unappreciated and exhausted.

Part 11: Summer 2024 – The Cottage Trip

In the summer of 2024, all my girl cousins, my sisters, and I went to a cottage together. At first, I thought it would be a fun, relaxing getaway, but it quickly became one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.

By default, I became the chef for the entire group—nine people in total. Every single meal was my responsibility. I cooked, cleaned, and handled everything while everyone else lounged around. No one offered to help, and when I asked for assistance, I was met with dismissive shrugs or disrespectful “pfft” responses.

The tension kept building throughout the trip. It was clear that I was being taken advantage of, and I was fuming. It wasn’t just the cooking and cleaning; I had also done the bulk of the grocery shopping for the trip, which was another burden that no one else had really stepped up to share. Only Noor, Tasnim, and Dania, my cousins, helped in small ways, but even their efforts couldn’t offset the overwhelming workload.

The Garden Party

One of the biggest highlights—or what should have been the highlight—of the trip was a dinner party Noor and I planned called the Garden Party. I had spent weeks preparing for it, putting in so much effort to make it special. I bought decorations, fresh flowers, and thrifted unique pieces to create the perfect ambiance. I spent hours cooking multiple dishes and even did everyone’s hair and makeup to ensure they felt as elegant as the setting I had created.

From the beginning, Mariam made it clear that she didn’t care about the party. She didn’t want to spend extra money on it and showed zero interest in the event. I accepted that, but I couldn’t have predicted how her attitude would escalate once the party began.

When the dinner started, Noor and I wanted to take pictures with the setup we had worked so hard on. It was only natural—we had planned the entire thing, and we wanted to capture the beautiful results of our efforts. We spent just a few minutes snapping some cute photos.

Despite her earlier indifference, Mariam suddenly threw a tantrum about not getting any good pictures of herself. She complained that the photos of her were blurry or unflattering and made a huge scene. Her outburst ruined the mood of the party. It wasn’t just frustrating—it was devastating.

Mariam’s tantrum turned something that was supposed to be meaningful and joyful into a selfish spectacle. She had openly said she didn’t care about the party, yet she hijacked the moment and made it all about her. To make matters worse, her outburst left me with just a few blurry, rushed photos of myself, taken in the span of five minutes, while she demanded more attention for her pictures.

The Aftermath

By the time the cottage trip was over, I was livid. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much time, money, and effort I had poured into making the trip and the Garden Party special, only for it to be completely ruined.

No one thanked me for the meals, the planning, or the countless hours I spent trying to make everything perfect. Instead, I was treated like an unpaid servant, and the people I cared about acted like spoiled brats. Mariam’s behavior during the party was the final straw—it felt like a slap in the face after all the work I had done.

Looking back, this trip left me feeling used, unappreciated, and disrespected. What should have been a cherished memory turned into yet another reminder of how much I give to the people around me, only to have it go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Part 12: The Fallout After the Cottage

Following the cottage trip in June 2024, my relationship with Mariam hit an all-time low. We didn’t speak for a month or two after the trip—I was so angry at her for ruining the Garden Party and, by extension, the entire experience for me. My frustration ran deep, and the silence between us felt necessary for me to process everything. Meanwhile, my tension with Layla only escalated, adding to the turmoil in my life.

Mariam’s Short-Lived Relationship and My Solo Trip

By late August, Mariam found herself in the throes of another breakup. She had been in a short two-month relationship with a guy who was clearly still in love with his ex. The situation left her emotionally shattered. Her anxiety and depression from the breakup were so severe that she lost over 10 pounds.

At the same time, I had my own struggles and decided to take a solo trip to Oregon. I needed space—not just from Mariam but from everything happening at home. While I couldn’t be there for her in person during this difficult time, I wanted to make sure she felt supported. I asked my boyfriend to check in on her, call her, and be there for her as much as he could in my absence.

Zuzu’s Health Declines

While dealing with Mariam’s breakup from afar, I was also facing a heartbreaking situation with Zuzu. By the end of July, Zuzu began having serious health problems, which worsened in early August, necessitating surgery. Even after the surgery, she wasn’t doing well, and I found myself constantly monitoring her condition—checking on her almost ten times an hour to ensure she was okay.

What made this even harder was Layla’s abusive behavior toward Zuzu. She went out of her way to make the environment uncomfortable and unsafe for her. Layla would turn the room freezing cold, even when she wasn’t there, seemingly just to “freeze out” Zuzu. It was cruel and infuriating, and it added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Part 13: The Breaking Point

In October 2024, Layla’s violence escalated to an unimaginable level. She completely lost control, attacking me and leaving deep cuts all over my neck. I was in shock and utterly distraught, my body physically marked by her cruelty and my spirit crushed by the emotional weight of the situation

Part 13: The Breaking Point (continued)

Desperate for support, I called Nina, someone I had always trusted and considered a pillar of support. Initially, she listened as I cried and poured out my feelings, but within minutes, it felt as though she stopped believing me. Despite being able to see the cuts on my neck, her demeanor shifted, and she began questioning the severity of what I was telling her. The experience left me feeling gaslit, as though my pain and trauma weren’t valid.

Seeking solace elsewhere, I called Mariam, furious and broken. I yelled at her, telling her I couldn’t keep speaking to her if she continued to remain close to Layla. Her alliance with someone who had caused me so much pain felt like the ultimate betrayal. I told her she had to make a choice: stand with me or with Layla. She refused to respond definitively, leaving me even more devastated.

November 14: The Birthday Dinner

As Layla’s birthday dinner approached on November 15, it became yet another point of contention. The chosen restaurant was one I loved and had been planning to visit with my cousins for months. I asked them not to go to this specific place, explaining that I couldn’t afford to go again if they did, as it would ruin the experience for me. My request was misunderstood—they thought I was asking them not to celebrate Layla’s birthday at all.

The situation spiraled out of control in our group chat. Nina, Mariam, and Tara immediately jumped to Layla’s defense, downplaying my concerns and making me feel like I was overreacting. Their defense of her felt like a direct invalidation of everything I had endured. Overwhelmed with frustration and disbelief, I left the group chat.

The Call with Nina

After leaving the chat, Nina called me, and I broke down. I begged her to acknowledge how terrible Layla had been—not just to me, but in general. While Nina admitted that Layla’s actions toward me were horrible, she refused to say that Layla was a horrible person. Her reasoning was that if she labeled Layla as such but still chose to hang out with her, it would make her feel fake or fraudulent.

Her logic devastated me. I couldn’t understand how someone who claimed to care about me could still choose to stand by Layla. I told Nina exactly how I felt—that her actions were phony and hypocritical. How could I trust someone who wouldn’t stand firmly by my side? This realization left me questioning the depth of our relationship.

In a final act of severing trust, I removed Nina from being able to see my location.

November 15: The Birthday Dinner

The next day, Layla’s birthday dinner went ahead as planned. Mariam went all out, even getting her a custom cake. Seeing their celebration wasn’t just painful—it was deeply symbolic of how little my suffering mattered to them.

Adding to the sting, Mariam moved a family gathering that was originally supposed to happen at my parents’ house to her own place. It was a calculated decision, one that excluded me entirely, knowing I wouldn’t be invited. The deliberate nature of these actions left me feeling more isolated than ever.

November 17: The Gathering

Tonight, as Mariam hosts this gathering at her house, I feel nothing but betrayal. Everyone who I had supported—cooking for them, hosting them, being there for them—is at her house, laughing and spending time together, while I’m left out entirely.

They’ve shown me time and again that they will side with Layla, dismissing the years of abuse and torment she has inflicted on me. It’s a profound and painful realization: my pain, my voice, my presence—they don’t matter to the people I once considered my closest circle.

Reflection

For me, this situation is black and white: you cannot stay neutral. If my cousins and Mariam choose to remain close to Layla, they cannot remain close to me. The years of torment, violence, and pain Layla has caused me are too severe to ignore. Their refusal to choose, or even acknowledge the depth of my suffering, is a betrayal I cannot overlook.

Right now, I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my cousins, my friends. The people I’ve given so much to have let me down in the most profound way. I am alone, and the heartbreak of their betrayal feels heavier than I ever thought possible.

How can I change my life? Moving out isn’t really possible. How can I have everyone back? 

TL;DR  my sister ruined my life. She’s physically abusive  and caused for me to lose everyone around me because no one will pick sides",1,1732599641.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Grandma had a partner who she lived with. I will come him Gary . So when I moved with Grandma I was expecting for me to just be on my own in my room they provided me. Gary seemed really cool at first, he would wake up the same time I’ll wake up for school and he would make me coffee with bread . That was cool since no one has ever made me breakfast before school. After a while he would buy me clothes and shoes which my grandma was pushing in always trying it on and show my outfits to Gary. I thought innocently since I was excited to show them off too. After a while grandma pushes me to cal Gary grandpa which I was still not ready to but I had to anyways or else she’ would get mad. She pressure me to hug him every time I said bye. That made me uncomfortable because he would want to kiss my cheeks and not just one side both of them . I felt so weird when it would happen. When time passes I realize that he stares at me a lot like each time I would pass by the living room and he would sit in the couch watching tv but he would stare from up and down my body. Then when I started high school I started puberty and I starting eating lots of junk food like a teen would. During dinner times he would mention every time that I should take care of my body and eat good. That I should worry about my weight and that trashy food makes you overweight . Gary was a vegetarian. I was happy with them because I would always get what I want, Gary would bring us to the parks and lakes and he always wanted me to spoil me. Until I started seeing signs form grandma being jealous. She started to catch up on Gary staring at me too much. She would burst in madness which Idk what happen. Ok to end the conversation, every night we had a family routine of watching family show in the living room. But grandma would get tried and go to her room to sleep and it always happened that I would end up sitting next to Gary to hug him because I truly saw him as a grandpa mind you I never had a dad figure. He would hug back but eventually always ended touching and rubbing my inner thighs . I felt so weird cz grandma was always sleeping. It happened many times I never speak up because grandma loved him so much. I saw him different after those incidents. Now that I look back I don’t know what to think idk if he truly loved me as a granddaughter or was I just a fantasy he wanted ? 😭😭also every time I had a bikini for swimming he would always mention that I had celulitis 😭😭 I wanted to take this off my chest since I don’t want to tell anyone I know but I want to release it.

I am 27 years of age Irish guy who is 5ft 10"" 80 kg.

Due to my Job I travel quite a bit as an engineer installing machines for customers. Which is why a LDR might work better if you are open to it. However for the foreseeable future I will be in Portland for December, then in Netherlands for 3 weeks for vacation then I will be back in Portland until April. I don't intend on in staying in my current role forever and will settle down once the timing is right. Where that will be I don't know yet, through this Job I am exposed to many different cultures and unique places. I will always have a hotel room to myself wherever I get sent to.

My hobbies include hiking, going on long drives exploring the new places I find myself, gaming when i get the chance, finding good coffee, trying new things, reading and deep conversations.

About my kinks and what I am looking for in a partner:

Ideally I'm looking for someone my age or a little older. But it's not a defined age range.

As far as looks, for me I'm more attracted to the personality most of all if we are a good fit and compatible that is the most important thing to me. I like independent women who know where they stand and have their own personality.

My main kink is power exchange, the feeling of someone else making my decisions for me is enticing. I also like the humiliation aspect of doing things that I wouldn't necessarily want to do if I was in control. My dream is to serve a loving woman and to devote myself to pleasing and making her life the best that I possibly can.

From my prospective as a sub my kinks shouldn't be as important. I don't want to be the type of sub who bottoms from the top as it should be my goal to satisfy my dominant. But some of my favourites are orgasm control, worshipping, giving oral, foot worship, spanking and service. My favourite thing of all though would to be able to please and bring happiness and make the woman that I am devouring my life to happy.

I'm open to all sorts of kinks and am willing to try and explore most things, I'm curious about pegging and chastity, diapers and humiliation. But there isn't a single kink that is a must just that we are fairly compatible.

I'm looking for a dominant that I can keep close contact with that will guide and mold me to be better in both my vanilla life but also my like in kink. Someone who sets goals for me that are rewarded if I achieve them and sets punishments for me if fail. Who also enjoys setting tasks for me to complete for their amusement.

I'm also looking for a dominant that I can bond with on a personal level that cares about me succeeding in life and vice versa. As a career focused person I would like a relationship that both of us would help each other to achieve our personal and career goals.

My limits are blood, scat, blackmail, extreme CBT, or anything that could affect my employment negatively.

I'm sure I've left some details out. Feel free to message me and see if we can make a connection. Open to in person or online only as I am always moving around. Let me know If you would like to grab a coffee or some lunch as an icebreaker, my treat of course (if your in Portland)

Thank you for reading.

Reach out if you feel like you might think we could be compatible and we can find out together. The best way to get to know someone is through conversation.

Part 1: The Turning Point with Layla

My relationship with my younger sister, Layla, took a dark turn around early 2020. I was 20, and she was 16. Up until then, things were relatively normal between us, but it felt like something shifted in her almost overnight. Her behavior became erratic, harmful, and unpredictable. I’ve often wondered if she experienced some sort of trauma that she hasn’t shared, but whatever the root cause, she began directing her frustration and anger toward me.

Layla started invading my privacy in ways that left me feeling violated and helpless. She would steal my belongings—sometimes blatantly—and go through my things without hesitation. What made it even more infuriating was that she blamed my mom for her actions, as if to deflect responsibility. One particular incident that stands out is when she began taking my expensive perfumes. I had already given her permission to use them because I wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict, but it seemed like she took advantage of my generosity just to spite me.

To protect my belongings, I installed a lock on my door. Even then, I made the mistake of trusting her enough to share the code, not realizing she was the very person I needed protection from. Her behavior escalated in ways that made me feel powerless. She began taking my clothes—especially the ones my mom disapproved of, like crop tops and jeans—and either wearing them herself or destroying them. One time, she cut my jeans into shorts and tried to claim that I’d given them to her like that. Confronting my mom about these incidents wasn’t an option because I knew I’d get in trouble for owning those items in the first place.

The situation with Layla spilled over into other aspects of my life. During COVID, my older sister Mariam and I started a dessert business. It was something we were both passionate about and a rare bright spot in a dark time. We stayed up countless nights perfecting recipes and creating desserts, and the business was thriving. But Layla found a way to ruin that too. She began deliberately breaking the desserts we worked so hard to make, sometimes right before we were about to deliver them. Her actions were so disruptive that we had to shut the business down entirely. It wasn’t just about the loss of income; it felt like she was sabotaging one of the few things I was proud of.

Our home life became unbearable. The constant tension led to explosive fights almost every night. Mariam and I tried to make our parents see what Layla was doing, but they dismissed it. They didn’t take her actions seriously or hold her accountable, which left me feeling completely unsupported. Every evening seemed to end with us yelling in the living room, desperately trying to be heard, but the situation never improved.

The fights reached a boiling point, and eventually, both Mariam and I were kicked out of the house. Looking back, I can’t help but feel that Layla’s behavior was the catalyst for everything falling apart. The experience left me deeply hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned with my family.

Part 2: A Family in Crisis

Toward the end of 2020, things took an even darker turn. One night, my dad appeared to have a medical emergency. It seemed like a heart attack or seizure—his body was convulsing, he was foaming at the mouth, and he was struggling to breathe. Mariam and I ran downstairs to find my mom, Layla, and my brother, Adam, just sitting there, watching him as if they were in a trance. They hadn’t called an ambulance.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. For what must have been five minutes, they just watched him suffer. Mariam and I immediately sprang into action, calling for help while the rest of my family stood by and did nothing. It was surreal and deeply unsettling to witness their indifference during such a critical moment.

You’d think this event would have been a wake-up call for our family, a moment to put our differences aside and come together. But that didn’t happen. The fights continued as if nothing had changed.

Part 3: Becoming the Black Sheep

Not long after, I finally managed to buy a car. It felt like a small victory, a sign that things might start looking up. For a brief moment, I allowed myself to feel hopeful.

But my family has always had a way of pulling me back into the chaos. I’ve been branded as the black sheep for as long as I can remember, even as a child. Whenever fights broke out, I was the one blamed, regardless of the circumstances. It didn’t matter who started it or what the issue was; the conclusion was always the same—I was the problem.

This dynamic has left me feeling isolated and misunderstood. It’s as though no matter how hard I try to navigate these relationships or prove my worth, I’ll always be seen through this distorted lens.

Part 4: Running Away to Turkey

In early 2021, I turned 21, but my life was anything but celebratory. The constant fighting at home had become unbearable. Every day felt like a battle, and I reached a breaking point. Desperate for peace, I decided to run away to Turkey, hoping to escape the chaos and find some semblance of calm. I stayed there for five months, but my time in Turkey brought its own set of challenges—ones that were deeply traumatic and left lasting scars.

Back home, Layla’s behavior only worsened in my absence. She continued her destructive patterns, cutting the cord to an expensive coffee machine we had and breaking Mariam’s laptop. My dad’s health also took a turn for the worse again, and even though I was miles away, the dysfunction I had tried to leave behind still loomed over me. I couldn’t help but feel responsible, blaming Layla for forcing me into this position.

While I was in Turkey, things went from bad to worse. I found myself in incredibly dangerous situations where I was nearly raped and attacked multiple times. The fear and helplessness I experienced during those moments were overwhelming. I kept thinking about how none of this would have happened if Layla hadn’t made home life so unbearable that I felt I had no choice but to leave.

The emotional toll of Turkey didn’t end there. The worst part of my time away was discovering that my mom, the person who should have been my greatest source of love and support, had been going around wishing and praying for my death. Hearing this crushed me. It confirmed all the feelings of rejection and abandonment I’d carried for years.

As if things couldn’t get more complicated, I was also robbed of $2,000 by a girl who pretended to be my friend. She gained my trust, only to betray me in one of the most vulnerable periods of my life. After robbing me, she went a step further and messaged inappropriate things to my friends—and even to my dad. It was humiliating and horrifying, adding another layer of betrayal to an already unbearable situation.

Despite the chaos, I made one decision for myself during that time: I got a nose job while I was there. It was one of the few things I did that felt like it was for me and no one else, though it didn’t make up for the rest of the hardships I endured.

By the time I returned from Turkey, my PTSD and anxiety were at an all-time high. The weight of what I’d experienced—both back home and during my time away—was suffocating. I came back not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had nowhere else to go. Turkey was supposed to be my escape, but it turned into another nightmare that left me even more broken than before.

Part 5: The Continued Trauma of 2022

By 2022, the chaos in my life persisted, dominated by Layla’s relentless harassment, theft, and physical abuse. Her behavior had reached a point where I couldn’t find a single moment of peace. Adding to this already unbearable situation, my older sister, Mariam, went through a traumatic breakup with her boyfriend of five years in February. Although they reconciled after just a week, the emotional fallout from the breakup created a new layer of turmoil in my life.

The Dynamic with Mariam

During this time, I found myself taking on an overwhelming amount of responsibility in our shared household. I cooked every meal for both Mariam and me, and her only job was to wash the dishes afterward. But more often than not, she wouldn’t clean up, leaving the dishes to pile up and the house in chaos. This neglect escalated the already tense atmosphere in our family. My mom, rather than holding Mariam accountable, would pray for bad things to happen to both of us, directing her anger at me as though I were to blame for everything.

Mariam, still dealing with her own emotional pain from her relationship struggles, took her frustration out on me. It felt like I was a punching bag for everyone’s rage. To make things worse, Mariam frequently found ways to waste my money, often in thoughtless or careless ways.

One recurring issue was the laundry. Mariam ruined countless clothes by bleaching them or handling them irresponsibly. I took on almost all the household responsibilities—I cared for the cat, did the laundry, cleaned the house, and cooked—but it never seemed enough. Every task I completed was overshadowed by her careless actions, which drained both my energy and my finances.

The breaking point came after a series of escalating conflicts. We had gone on a vacation together earlier that year, but two days into the trip, Mariam decided she wanted to go home. It was an infuriating waste of money and effort, and I felt completely disrespected. Later, a seemingly small incident pushed me over the edge: Mariam told me the wrong date for a Sephora return, which led me to believe I had lost an additional $400. I was at work when I realized what happened, and in my frustration, I texted her to get out of the house.

Mariam had already signed a lease for a new place, with her move-in date just a month away, but she hadn’t told our parents about her plans. She used my text as an excuse to paint the narrative that I had kicked her out of the house, even though it wasn’t my house to begin with. This marked the point of no return in our relationship. The resentment, misunderstandings, and constant financial strain had piled up to a breaking point.

The Vancouver Trip

In October 2022, Mariam and I attempted to salvage our relationship by going on another trip together, this time to Vancouver. But instead of healing, the trip brought more tension. Mariam’s financial problems meant she couldn’t afford to do much on the trip, which made everything feel strained. On top of that, she spent much of the trip crying over her boyfriend, who she was still having constant problems with.

It felt like history repeating itself: why agree to go on a vacation if you’re just going to spend it upset and unable to enjoy anything? I couldn’t help but feel that, once again, my money and effort were being wasted. The trip, instead of bringing us closer, only deepened the resentment between us.

The Breaking Point with Layla

In December 2022, Layla’s behavior escalated to outright violence. One day, she hit me out of nowhere. It wasn’t just a random act of aggression; it was the culmination of years of abuse and torment. I was shaken, angry, and exhausted. I finally realized that I couldn’t take it anymore.

I called Mariam, desperate for support, but her closeness to Layla felt like the ultimate betrayal. How could she stay so close to someone who had repeatedly assaulted me and made my life a living hell? That was the moment I decided to cut Mariam off completely. Her refusal to acknowledge the impact of Layla’s abuse, combined with her own treatment of me, was too much to bear.

This year was a breaking point in so many ways—emotionally, financially, and physically. The relationships I once hoped would provide me with comfort and stability became sources of pain and exhaustion. Cutting ties with Mariam felt like a necessary step for my own survival, even if it was heartbreaking. My world felt smaller and lonelier, but I knew I couldn’t keep sacrificing my well-being for people who didn’t value me.

Part 6: Isolation and Uneasy Reconciliations

By December 2022, the isolation in my family dynamics became even more pronounced. Mariam constantly invited everyone—our cousins, mutual friends, and family—over to her house. I, however, was never invited. This exclusion created a deep sense of loneliness and alienation. I felt disconnected from the people I cared about, as they naturally gravitated to Mariam’s space.

When I tried to bridge the gap by inviting people over to my house, it rarely worked out. Mariam would often show up despite the tension between us, making the gatherings uncomfortable. I’d spend time and money preparing food, hoping to foster connection, only to feel undermined by her presence. It left me questioning why I even bothered.

Part 7: A Shared Breakup and a Fragile Bond

In February 2023, Mariam and I both experienced breakups within days of each other. It was an unexpected turning point. The shared heartbreak brought us closer together. We found solace in each other’s company, leaning on one another in a way we hadn’t in years.

For a time, things felt okay between us. Despite the underlying tension and unresolved issues, there was a sense of camaraderie born out of mutual pain.

Part 8: A Summer of Respite

The summer of 2023 provided a rare break from the usual chaos. Layla, my mom, and my youngest sister, Amal, went away for the entire summer. Their absence brought some much-needed relief, but it didn’t eliminate all the tension.

Even from a distance, Layla continued to stir up conflict. She would make incendiary comments in the family group chat, often targeting me. My brother, Adam, and Amal would join in, piling on and turning every conversation into an attack. When I defended myself, I was painted as the bad person, the instigator, even though I was simply standing up for myself.

Despite these challenges, Mariam and I maintained a good relationship over the summer. There was still some lingering resentment on both sides—remnants of past conflicts—but we managed to keep things civil, even though we bickered occasionally.

Part 9: A Tumultuous Fall

By November 2023, Layla’s behavior escalated again. She became physically violent toward me once more, a painful reminder that little had changed. The cycle of abuse felt never-ending, and I couldn’t see a way out of it.

At the same time, my relationship with Mariam remained relatively stable. We weren’t as close as we had been after our breakups, but we were okay—cordial, if not completely harmonious.

Part 10: Overwhelmed by Everyone

By this time, I was in a committed relationship, which provided a glimmer of stability amidst the chaos. But other dynamics in my life were becoming overwhelming.

With everything happening in the world, my cousins and I became deeply trauma-bonded. They started coming over to my house constantly—so often that it felt like they were there 24/7. While I cherished the connection we shared, it came with its own challenges.

I found myself cooking and cleaning for everyone, providing meals and hospitality without any acknowledgment or gratitude. Every visit felt like a drain on my resources—emotional, physical, and financial. I was paying for everyone’s food, cleaning up after them, and putting in effort that no one seemed to notice. It left me feeling unappreciated and exhausted.

Part 11: Summer 2024 – The Cottage Trip

In the summer of 2024, all my girl cousins, my sisters, and I went to a cottage together. At first, I thought it would be a fun, relaxing getaway, but it quickly became one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.

By default, I became the chef for the entire group—nine people in total. Every single meal was my responsibility. I cooked, cleaned, and handled everything while everyone else lounged around. No one offered to help, and when I asked for assistance, I was met with dismissive shrugs or disrespectful “pfft” responses.

The tension kept building throughout the trip. It was clear that I was being taken advantage of, and I was fuming. It wasn’t just the cooking and cleaning; I had also done the bulk of the grocery shopping for the trip, which was another burden that no one else had really stepped up to share. Only Noor, Tasnim, and Dania, my cousins, helped in small ways, but even their efforts couldn’t offset the overwhelming workload.

The Garden Party

One of the biggest highlights—or what should have been the highlight—of the trip was a dinner party Noor and I planned called the Garden Party. I had spent weeks preparing for it, putting in so much effort to make it special. I bought decorations, fresh flowers, and thrifted unique pieces to create the perfect ambiance. I spent hours cooking multiple dishes and even did everyone’s hair and makeup to ensure they felt as elegant as the setting I had created.

From the beginning, Mariam made it clear that she didn’t care about the party. She didn’t want to spend extra money on it and showed zero interest in the event. I accepted that, but I couldn’t have predicted how her attitude would escalate once the party began.

When the dinner started, Noor and I wanted to take pictures with the setup we had worked so hard on. It was only natural—we had planned the entire thing, and we wanted to capture the beautiful results of our efforts. We spent just a few minutes snapping some cute photos.

Despite her earlier indifference, Mariam suddenly threw a tantrum about not getting any good pictures of herself. She complained that the photos of her were blurry or unflattering and made a huge scene. Her outburst ruined the mood of the party. It wasn’t just frustrating—it was devastating.

Mariam’s tantrum turned something that was supposed to be meaningful and joyful into a selfish spectacle. She had openly said she didn’t care about the party, yet she hijacked the moment and made it all about her. To make matters worse, her outburst left me with just a few blurry, rushed photos of myself, taken in the span of five minutes, while she demanded more attention for her pictures.

The Aftermath

By the time the cottage trip was over, I was livid. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much time, money, and effort I had poured into making the trip and the Garden Party special, only for it to be completely ruined.

No one thanked me for the meals, the planning, or the countless hours I spent trying to make everything perfect. Instead, I was treated like an unpaid servant, and the people I cared about acted like spoiled brats. Mariam’s behavior during the party was the final straw—it felt like a slap in the face after all the work I had done.

Looking back, this trip left me feeling used, unappreciated, and disrespected. What should have been a cherished memory turned into yet another reminder of how much I give to the people around me, only to have it go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Part 12: The Fallout After the Cottage

Following the cottage trip in June 2024, my relationship with Mariam hit an all-time low. We didn’t speak for a month or two after the trip—I was so angry at her for ruining the Garden Party and, by extension, the entire experience for me. My frustration ran deep, and the silence between us felt necessary for me to process everything. Meanwhile, my tension with Layla only escalated, adding to the turmoil in my life.

Mariam’s Short-Lived Relationship and My Solo Trip

By late August, Mariam found herself in the throes of another breakup. She had been in a short two-month relationship with a guy who was clearly still in love with his ex. The situation left her emotionally shattered. Her anxiety and depression from the breakup were so severe that she lost over 10 pounds.

At the same time, I had my own struggles and decided to take a solo trip to Oregon. I needed space—not just from Mariam but from everything happening at home. While I couldn’t be there for her in person during this difficult time, I wanted to make sure she felt supported. I asked my boyfriend to check in on her, call her, and be there for her as much as he could in my absence.

Zuzu’s Health Declines

While dealing with Mariam’s breakup from afar, I was also facing a heartbreaking situation with Zuzu. By the end of July, Zuzu began having serious health problems, which worsened in early August, necessitating surgery. Even after the surgery, she wasn’t doing well, and I found myself constantly monitoring her condition—checking on her almost ten times an hour to ensure she was okay.

What made this even harder was Layla’s abusive behavior toward Zuzu. She went out of her way to make the environment uncomfortable and unsafe for her. Layla would turn the room freezing cold, even when she wasn’t there, seemingly just to “freeze out” Zuzu. It was cruel and infuriating, and it added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Part 13: The Breaking Point

In October 2024, Layla’s violence escalated to an unimaginable level. She completely lost control, attacking me and leaving deep cuts all over my neck. I was in shock and utterly distraught, my body physically marked by her cruelty and my spirit crushed by the emotional weight of the situation

Part 13: The Breaking Point (continued)

Desperate for support, I called Nina, someone I had always trusted and considered a pillar of support. Initially, she listened as I cried and poured out my feelings, but within minutes, it felt as though she stopped believing me. Despite being able to see the cuts on my neck, her demeanor shifted, and she began questioning the severity of what I was telling her. The experience left me feeling gaslit, as though my pain and trauma weren’t valid.

Seeking solace elsewhere, I called Mariam, furious and broken. I yelled at her, telling her I couldn’t keep speaking to her if she continued to remain close to Layla. Her alliance with someone who had caused me so much pain felt like the ultimate betrayal. I told her she had to make a choice: stand with me or with Layla. She refused to respond definitively, leaving me even more devastated.

November 14: The Birthday Dinner

As Layla’s birthday dinner approached on November 15, it became yet another point of contention. The chosen restaurant was one I loved and had been planning to visit with my cousins for months. I asked them not to go to this specific place, explaining that I couldn’t afford to go again if they did, as it would ruin the experience for me. My request was misunderstood—they thought I was asking them not to celebrate Layla’s birthday at all.

The situation spiraled out of control in our group chat. Nina, Mariam, and Tara immediately jumped to Layla’s defense, downplaying my concerns and making me feel like I was overreacting. Their defense of her felt like a direct invalidation of everything I had endured. Overwhelmed with frustration and disbelief, I left the group chat.

The Call with Nina

After leaving the chat, Nina called me, and I broke down. I begged her to acknowledge how terrible Layla had been—not just to me, but in general. While Nina admitted that Layla’s actions toward me were horrible, she refused to say that Layla was a horrible person. Her reasoning was that if she labeled Layla as such but still chose to hang out with her, it would make her feel fake or fraudulent.

Her logic devastated me. I couldn’t understand how someone who claimed to care about me could still choose to stand by Layla. I told Nina exactly how I felt—that her actions were phony and hypocritical. How could I trust someone who wouldn’t stand firmly by my side? This realization left me questioning the depth of our relationship.

In a final act of severing trust, I removed Nina from being able to see my location.

November 15: The Birthday Dinner

The next day, Layla’s birthday dinner went ahead as planned. Mariam went all out, even getting her a custom cake. Seeing their celebration wasn’t just painful—it was deeply symbolic of how little my suffering mattered to them.

Adding to the sting, Mariam moved a family gathering that was originally supposed to happen at my parents’ house to her own place. It was a calculated decision, one that excluded me entirely, knowing I wouldn’t be invited. The deliberate nature of these actions left me feeling more isolated than ever.

November 17: The Gathering

Tonight, as Mariam hosts this gathering at her house, I feel nothing but betrayal. Everyone who I had supported—cooking for them, hosting them, being there for them—is at her house, laughing and spending time together, while I’m left out entirely.

They’ve shown me time and again that they will side with Layla, dismissing the years of abuse and torment she has inflicted on me. It’s a profound and painful realization: my pain, my voice, my presence—they don’t matter to the people I once considered my closest circle.

Reflection

For me, this situation is black and white: you cannot stay neutral. If my cousins and Mariam choose to remain close to Layla, they cannot remain close to me. The years of torment, violence, and pain Layla has caused me are too severe to ignore. Their refusal to choose, or even acknowledge the depth of my suffering, is a betrayal I cannot overlook.

Right now, I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my cousins, my friends. The people I’ve given so much to have let me down in the most profound way. I am alone, and the heartbreak of their betrayal feels heavier than I ever thought possible.",1,1732599154.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

(Advice needed),"So I, 19 nonbinary, am caught in a cluster fuck of a situation. So a bit of back story, my sister,19 female and yes we are twins so the ages makes sense. So back on topic, my sister had people over without telling our mom. It's just a common courtesy considering that this is my moms house and my mom works 3rd shift. So she had this lady and her kids at the house all day and I don't know what they were doing and considering I don't like kids, I didn't take my ass out there. So I was sitting in my room with my door cracked, blasting music to drown out the lady's children because again, I don't like kids or most people for real. I literally looked like that fucking bear walking out of its cave after hibernation, a fucking mess. So I hear my mom comes into the house because my window is right by the back door and I was going to say hi and ask how was work but all I heard was yelling. So naturally I got dressed and walked out of my room to see my sister storming off to her room. I asked what happened but no one answered me. So I then sat in the living room with my mom and friends, (we texted and went out to eat after that so that's why they were there), and I looked down as I sat on the love seat and I saw these red and pink dots on the carpet and I asked what it was and my sister said paint. I then asked why the hell she would paint in the living room because that's fucking stupid. 

So now that yall know the backstory let me get to the point.

Yesterday when I got off of work and my mom was driving us home and my mom was ranting about not being able to find her favorite hoodie and I said that i didn't have it. She then literally said, "" motha fucker I know you don't have it. I was wearing the bitch when I dropped you off"". I dead ass was like, 'well okay damn but go off'. So we get home and I let our dogs out so they can do their business and I went to the bathroom because it's that time of month for me. Yes I am biologically a female, but I can make a good ass coffee. Stop playing. Anyways I'm so dead ass in saying I was sitting on the fucking toilet as they started arguing. I'm literally like, 'okay, what the fuck happened'? So basically it was just a back and forth of my mom telling my sister that she needs to get her stuff off the table and to clean the stains off of the carpet. My sister started getting more disrespectful and she told my mom to, ""get the fuck out of my room"", or to ""stop fucking talking to her"". I'm not gonna lie, I was waiting for the black to be smacked off of her but the argument just escalated and my mom just threw my sisters stuff in my sisters room because she was literally like not listening to her. Keep in mind I'm still on the toilet, midway in changing my damn pad while I was texting my best Friends and scrolling on instagram. So after I got out the bathroom and I put my food in the fridge, my mom and I proceeded to spend like 20 minutes trying to clean the stains off of the carpet with little to no results. Like I was scrubbing until my arms were sore as hell. My mom pulled out her little chemical mix and the carpet cleaner and tried as well but the dots were still there. Turns out it wasn't paint but hair dye. She dyed that lady's hair in the living room on my moms couch. The way I just wanted to collapse because keep in mind this is right after I got off, not even an hour after I got off, but a few minutes! And I work in retail and it's the holiday season so yall know how it is. Like, I kid you the fuck not that fact made me even more pissed because I'm cleaning a mess THAT I DIDNT EVEN MAKE! It would have never happened if my sister literally did that shit in the bathroom and she's done this shit multiple times! So my moms literally went to my sisters room and told her that this is not her house, she just lives here. That it shows that she doesn't respect my mom and her house so my mom gave her an ultimatum, either she finds a way to get the stains out of the carpet or she  got 30 days to find somewhere else to live and my mom said she will take my sister to court because my mom's done with my sisters shit at this point and now they aren't talking. So back to my question. Would I be an asshole if i didn't help my sister or should i let the situation run its course?",3,1732599061.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,4,1.0,False

It hits different now that I'm an adult and I'm in the exact same situation, praying the exact same prayer while crying profusely in the middle of the night.

**TLDR:** He cheated on me...with 5 other men and 2 women. But...I still love him. And I don't want to anymore, but VERY unfortunately, I still do.

**LONG VERSION:**  
Since 2020 pa kami magkakilala. Tinry ko talagang pigilan yung sarili ko na magkaroon ng feelings sa kanya, let alone ma-fall. This is due to the fact that my relationship prior to him was...unsavory. I didn't wanna bother with the pain that wrought by love. Pero I convinced myself na love and pain live side by side, and to know love is to know pain. Di ko alam if ""maturity"" or ""character growth"" na ba 'yung tawag dito, pero I realized na if takot na takot akong masaktan, baka di na ako maka-experience ng pagmamahal. And no one ever became brave without being scared first. So ayun—hinayaan ko na 'yung sarili kong ma-fall sa kanya.

Throughout our relationship (not even sure if you could call it that), walang labels. Oo, alam ko—b\*b\* ako. Yet another thing that love makes people do. Pero okay lang. Sabi ko sa sarili ko, baka balang araw, piliin din niyang maging brave tulad ko. Pero naging cautious parin ako. After all, he insisted that he was ""straight"".

Pero bakit ganun? Puyatan hanggang madaling araw kaka-exchange ng sweet nothings, back and forth sa pics and inspirational quotes, tuloy tuloy na words of affirmation, giving each other gifts, multiple coffee dates and magical nights together...

Tapos in the span of 4 years na sinasabi niya sa akin na ""walang nagpapatibok sa puso niya"", meron na pala.

Samantalang nag-aksaya ako ng 4 of my prime years kakahintay at binibigay lahat ng mga bagay na di mabibili ng salapi sa kanya AND MORE.

All of that, tapos di ako 'yung pinili?

Di naman ako pangit. Sure, di kataas-taasan 'yung posisyon ko sa trabaho't di ganun kalaki 'yung sahod ko. Sure, wala akong kotse. Pero while most people can save up 2-3 years of their salaries to purchase a car or a house, most people can wait for an entire lifetime and still not get what I gave him—true and unconditional love.

'Yung tipong noong napi-pick up ko na na malamang-lamang, may kasama 'tong iba kasi di na nagrereply or may unseen force na kumukuha ng pics niya sa IG. Excuse lang niya is ""busy"" lang daw siya with work at lagi daw siyang may baong ""tripod"". Syempre, ako naman si t\*ng\*, maniniwala. Then again, in retrospect, I think it's less of ""napaniwala ako"" sa lies niya. It's more of ""I chose to understand"". Na everytime he made those excuses, I just nodded, smiled, and said, ""Okay, I understand.""

Need niya ng ""space"" and ""me time""? Of course I understand. Kahit din naman ako, need ko 'yun e.  
Need niya ng ""peace"" and ""relaxation""? Of course I understand. So shut up nalang muna ako sa mga hinanakit ko kasi ayoko siyang ma-stress.  
Need niya ng words of encouragement? Of course, I understand. With my expertise in the art of conversation paired with my love for him, I can easily heal him with mere words.  
Need niyang makita ako para may magamit siya for the night? Of course, I understand. Kanselado lahat ng plans tapos file ng VL, byahe ng milya-milya para lang makasama siya ng isang gabi.

Tapos di ako 'yung destinasyon niya?

Bakit? Anong meron SA KANILA na wala sa akin? Ano yung nabigay NILA sa kanya na never kong nabigay sa kanya in 4 \*\*\*\*ing years? 'Yung apartment ba? 'Yung kotse na kaya siyang dalhin kung saang lupalop man niya gustong pumunta?

Sa kanila, willing siyang magbigay ng labels. Sa kanila, willing siyang sabihin 'yung three most magical words that every person in love wants to hear—that I'VE been dying to hear for years. Sa kanila, willing siyang i-open up na bisexual talaga siya. Tapos pagdating sa akin, hindi?

And even after all of this...BAKIT MAHAL KO PA RIN SIYA?!  
Kahit na kung ano mang lumalabas sa bibig niya, di ko na kayang paniwalaan.  
Kahit anong effort ipakita niya, di ko na kayang pagkatiwalaan.  
Pero I'd still donate a kidney to him if he needed it. I'd still catch a bullet for him. I'd still offer my life and limb just to keep him happy and safe.

So tell me. Ain't THAT the definition of unconditional love? Na kahit di niya ako minahal gaya ng inakala ko, mahal ko pa rin siya? Ika nga ni Taylor Swift,  
*""True unconditional love is like...Do you love someone so much that you would even love them if they didn't love you anymore?""* 

I still love him...  
But I don't wanna love him anymore.  
But I can't unlove him.  
So I still love him.

I took about 5 years off after my first child was born. Have been playing for about a year and feel that I'm there for about 30 seconds in the 3rd, and that's it.

\- I play in an A level division once a week.  
\- About every couple weeks, I'll play in a coffee club skate which is quite a bit slower.  
\- Work 5 days a week, parent 7 days a week.  
\- I've got the time to fit something in almost every day.  
\- I'm over 40.

But I don't want to burn myself out. So what activity and how often? I have a full at home gym including boxing heavy bag and spin bike.

For awhile, I was doing the following:

\- A level skate Monday  
\- Spin Bike HIIT session on Wednesday night  
\- Boxing Heavy bag HIIT session on Friday night or Sat morning

This worked well for my first period performance, but I'm stuck in this rut where I feel great, even at 1:20 shifts. But by mid-game and the 3rd period, I get a huge burst of energy for about the first 30 seconds of the shift and then I'm dead.

I'm not so much looking for skill building. My mind is in the right place and I get enough stick and puck with my son to work on game mindset. I want to increase my stamina and endurance to help me get through a full game. I don't expect 100% level being over 40 years old, but prior to my 5 year break, I was playing 3 games per night sometimes and felt fine all 3 games.

If I have an A skate once a week, what can I do and what frequency the remainder of the week to prep me for the following week's game? I eat well all week, before games, after games, etc. Should I just keep up with my boxing and spin bike routine, try something different, or bow down to the being over the hill :D ? Prior to kids, I had enough time to play and mix in doing the BB Insanity program and that worked amazing. However, I don't know if I could hack that again with the time I have, 1.5 hours a week, plus skating.",5,1732598504.0,hockeyplayers,3,0.86,False

My right molar hurts when I bite down. I've seen two dentist, a specialist who have all told me to wait and I keep pushing them to help me. 

I did a CBCT scan on Thursday. The radiologist will review and create a report. I'm afraid it will come back showing nothing. 

I just wanted to clarify that my tooth pain seems to be more pressure-related rather than a sensitivity to hot or cold. I can drink hot and cold beverages without experiencing sharp pain—just a slight discomfort at most. I know I have sensitivity due to hot and cold, but some of my other teeth are sensitive to that as well. If it was just a sensitivity to cold, then wouldn't it also hurt when I use my water pick and the water is sometimes a little cold? Or when I drink an ice coffee? 

The sharp spike of pain occurs specifically when I bite down on softer items like a Q-tip, chewy foods, or when I put on my retainer. I also feel it with certain foods, such as sandwiches, chicken, and breaded chicken nuggets. The pain feels very focused on the tip of the tooth, especially along the pointy part of the enamel on the side, rather than across the whole tooth. It seems to originate closer to the premolar side, as the molar side doesn’t hurt. This isn’t a general ache but a sharp, specific sensation that happens only with pressure at certain angles. I can somewhat eat soft foods. 

My left upper molar, and bottom left and right molars has started to hurt.  I'm also feeling discomfort in my right lateral incisor and canine. My jaw hurts, shoulders hurts, back hurts. Overall, my bite feels very unbalanced, and I'm experiencing occasional headaches and throbbing. I'm concerned that I may lose both my left and right upper molars.

Now the pain seems to be coming from the big pointy part of my molar and the section close to my secondary premolar. 

I’ve spent the past year in constant pain, and I'd greatly appreciate any guidance. What do I do? Am I going to lose my molars?

The image is of my right molar. 

Thank you

Hey everyone,

I recently moved to Melbourne and thought I’d share my experience so far! It’s been a big change, but one that I’m thoroughly enjoying.

The city has such a vibrant vibe, from the buzzing laneways to the incredible coffee (seriously, Melbourne takes its coffee seriously). I’m still getting used to the unpredictable weather—it’s true what they say, you really can experience four seasons in one day.

I’m living in Footscray, and it’s been great exploring the local markets, cafes, and the multicultural food scene. Also, public transport here is surprisingly convenient, although I’m still figuring out the tram zones!

Since I’m balancing work and studying for my master’s degree, my schedule is a bit packed, but I’d love to find some cool spots to unwind on weekends. Any recommendations for must-see places, hidden gems, or just things to do? Also, if you’ve got tips on navigating Melbourne life, I’m all ears!

Grateful to call this city home for now and excited for what’s ahead. Looking forward to connecting with you all!

I am an extroverted introvert. I think the amount of extroversion vs introversion I expirience can depend on the people I'm around, my mental wellness, level of comfort etc. I have been described as both ""loud and funny"" as well as ""quiet and reserved"". 

The thing is, around people I'm comfortable with I'm very outgoing but when my social battery is low or I'm around too many people, don't trust the people I'm around or am distracted I can be very quiet.

Now that I've given context, I always here the phrase ""keep your head down"" from both extroverts and introverts when your in an environment you are not comfortable especially at work ""keep your head down, do your job and be yourself on your own time"" all I can say from personal expiriences that this hardly ever works. I have noticed as a child, minding my own buissness seems to anger people so bad. 

It has resulted in workplace abuse/bullying and unwanted contact in public. Just the other day I was at a coffee shop waiting in line and a woman and her partner were being very obnoxiously loud. I kept to myself and didin't really mind it as they are allowed to do whatever they want. The problems never started until they tried to make conversation with me. I half smiled at them but didin't really say anything as I wanted to be left alone. They ended up passive agressivly lashing out at me. I could tell they were seething at me. They felt the need to publically humiliate me because I didin't feel like talking. 

I don't cry much anymore but once I got homw I started sobbing. I seem to attract these sorts so much in public and the more I ignore them the harder they fight to be noticed. Even have had men hit me with their coats, bump into me and throw things at me to try and get my attention. I try to ignore them even harder because I refuse to give into bad behaviour, none of us asked to be on this planet and it's not my responsibility to put up with childish behaviour. Some times I lash out but somtimes I ignore. Both seem to go over poorly. 

I know not all extroverts lack understanding of personal space and boundries, and in the most gentle way possible: do extroverts get  their feelings hurt when they feel ignored ? It seems like explanations of why I need time to myself are not quite enough for everyone (some people yes but others no). Do some people think it's rude? I used to work with a really shy woman who I knew before. One of my coworkers was going off on her behind her back for ""being rude"" but I knew this woman since I was 13 and she is just very shy. Is it a need for external validation thing? 

BTW I am comfortable with you answering even if this is not you. I think extroverts may be able to better understand the thought process even if they don't act like this. I know from my perspective it's purely guessing. One of my closest friends is an extrovert and she is so in tune with my body language and knows exactly when I start to get uncomfertable or drained. Is it maybe from a lack of introverts in their lives? Maybe they don't understand? 

Thanks for the advice beautiful people :)

TLDR: can coming across introverted, shy, reserved or distant hurt extroverts feelings? ",3,1732597691.0,extroverts,2,1.0,False

If you're anything like me, you know that having the right gear is essential for capturing those perfect moments. That's why I want to talk about an incredible camera bag that has completely transformed my photography outings. The **customizable inner space** and smart design of this camera backpack make it a must-have for any photographer.

## Customizable Inner Space

One of the standout features of this camera bag is its **dedicated camera compartment**. Seriously, it’s like having a personal assistant for your gear! Here’s what you get:

- **5 removable padded dividers**: You can easily rearrange these dividers to fit your unique setup. Whether you’re packing your **SLR/DSLR camera**, **four lenses**, and a **flash**, or just your essentials, it’s all about flexibility.
- **DIY Inner Space**: Adjust the dividers to make the most of the space. I love how I can fit everything snugly without worrying about my gear clanking around.

And when you’re done with your photography session? This bag converts into a casual backpack in a flash. Perfect for those impromptu coffee runs post-shoot!

## Multiple Pockets for Organisation

I can’t stress enough how important organisation is when you’re out and about. This camera backpack has a pocket for everything:

- **1 main camera compartment**: Perfect for your photography devices.
- **1 dedicated pocket for your laptop**: Fits up to a **14-inch laptop** or **12.9-inch iPad**. 
- **2 mesh pockets**: Ideal for your wallet, charger, or keys.
- **1 front zipper pocket**: Great for pens and paper.
- **1 anti-theft back pocket**: Keeps your phone secure.
- **1 expanding side pocket**: Perfect for a water bottle or compact tripod.
- **Another side pocket**: Includes three battery pouches and a zipper pocket for SD cards.

I’ve found that having everything in its place not only saves time but also keeps my mind clear when I’m shooting.

## Waterproof Fabric & Device Security

Let’s face it, weather can be unpredictable! That’s why the **waterproof and scratch-resistant polyester fabric** of this bag is a game changer. It keeps my gear safe from the rain and protects against scratches when I’m out in the wild. 

- **Thick foam padding** surrounds the whole camera case, providing excellent protection for your equipment.
- It even comes with a **waterproof rain cover** for those extreme weather days. I once got caught in a downpour, and I was so grateful for this feature!

## Tripod Holder & Quick Side Access

If you’re a fan of capturing spontaneous moments, you’ll appreciate the **quick side access design**. Need to grab your camera in a hurry? No problem!

- **Tripod holder**: Carry your tripod two ways:
  - **Side stretch pocket** with a compression strap.
  - **Bottom straps** with an adjustable buckle for various sizes.

This feature is a lifesaver when you’re trying to capture the perfect shot without fumbling around. 

## Dimensions & Practical Design

Let’s talk practicality. Here’s the scoop:

- **Size**: 11 x 5.5 x 15.7 inches (L x W x H).
- **Weight**: Just 2.09 lbs – super lightweight!

It fits nicely under an airplane seat, making it perfect for travel. The **sturdy top handle** and **ventilated shoulder straps** ensure comfort, while the **anti-theft design** keeps your gear secure.

### FAQs

**1. Can this bag fit a DSLR with a lens attached?**  
Yes, you can fit a DSLR with a lens attached, plus additional lenses and accessories.

**2. Is the bag comfortable for long hikes?**  
Absolutely! The ventilated shoulder straps add comfort for long durations.

**3. How does the waterproof cover work?**  
The waterproof rain cover is stored in a separate pocket and can be easily deployed in rainy conditions.

**4. Can I fit a laptop and camera equipment at the same time?**  
Yes, there’s a designated pocket for your laptop, and you can still have your camera gear securely stored.

A friend and I are building a business model that aims at solving the gap between artists and venue owners. As a part of this research, I'd love to reach out to anyone who satisfies the following criteria: 

1. is a musician who has played at ticketed gigs and earns revenue from the same
2. is a venue owner who is scouting for talent to improve revenue
3. is an event organiser who is neither of the above but has experienced in the same

We understand that the live gig scene is not necessarily profit driven but is instrumental in any musician's journey. Venue owners also do this primarily due to passion and love for the musical arts. 

I am not soliciting business nor asking anyone to share confidential information. All of this is market research to hopefully make the live scene more profitable to all stakeholders.

If you have 60-90 minutes to spare, I'd be grateful if you can either reply below or DM me directly. In return, I promise to deliver a coffee to your address.

I recently started taking very serious my dental care when I started looking into why my teeth started feeling funny when eating candies or cold drinks.

I learned about gingivitis and periodontitis. I believe I already have periodontitis because of gum recession and the gaps in my tooth. I think my enamel is gone also. 

Nonetheless I started taking action and started flossing as a habit in my routine. I also purchase a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush and Waterpik waterflosser. In my research I learned that waterflossing is simply not enough. But I do try to waterfloss usually after eating a meal. And floss everyday.

A little about me, I drink about 2 cups of coffee everyday, for the last 10 years. I don’t really eat many sweet but some processed foods often (pastas, sausages, or breads). I do have pre hypertension and prediabetes and I am working on getting that under control. I am looking to take back my health, and I am freaked about my oral health because it seems good health start with your mouth.

I've successfully set up remote unlock from my Windows client PC (running Moonlight) to my Sunshine server PC in a (mostly) secure fashion. I wanted to share with the class, but first a few disclaimers:

---

## Disclaimers

- This setup involves **AutoHotkey scripts** on both the client and server. It seems relatively secure—about as secure as this sort of setup can get. **However, it requires saving RDP credentials on the client PC. Ensure your client PC is secure.**
- **I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR SYSTEMS.** I’m either a very smart dumb person or a very dumb smart person, depending on who you ask. Use this guide at your own risk.
- This took me half a day to get working. When I came up with the idea, I thought it would take an hour max. I am cranky. The last of the goodwill left in my shriveled Grinch heart is being used to share this publicly. If you need troubleshooting help or have questions, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anthonymkz) first.

---

## How It Works

1. The **client-side script** initializes an RDP session with the server PC by running a saved RDP credentials file. This script requires a PIN to run.
2. Once the RDP session is established, the **server-side script** transfers the RDP session to the console session, effectively unlocking the server PC since you're already logged in.
3. I trigger these scripts using a **Home Assistant automation**, but you can trigger them however you'd like once everything is set up.

---

## Changes You Need to Make

### Client-Side Script:
1. **Set a PIN for security**: The script uses an MD5 hash of your chosen PIN.
   - Generate the MD5 hash for your desired PIN [here](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/) and enter it into the script.
2. **Update the script** to point to the correct path for your saved RDP file.

### Server-Side Script:
1. Simply set this up to run the command to transfer the session to the console.

---

## Additional Recommendation

I suggest you compile the scripts into executable files. This allows you to:
- More easily run them with administrative privileges if needed.
- Prevent accidental modification of the scripts.

A Juliet balcony is one just big enough to lean out over and call for her lover. Wherefore \_art\_ thou Romeo? Meanwhile, Romeo is chilling on his own balcony, which is just big enough to host a small table and a buddy over for some of that great Italian expresso. Hmm, did they have espresso machines back then? I'm sure they had excellent coffee regardless.

OK, here's the thing: Juliet's balcony is a marvelously elegant design that exactly fits the two cantilever beams extending out from the main ceiling, where they they blend in with other similar beams of the same dimension. Romeo's balcony, on the other hand, has the same two structural beams, but also a bunch of extra complexity to widen out to a full 4x9.5 feet of deck space, just large enough for two buds and a coffee table. Extra complexity... surprisingly great.

Romeo's structural beams have to be notched where the deck floor crosses over them, not necessary at all for Juliet's balcony. Additional angle brackets of a different size are required to beef up the structural stability, the tempered glass panels are bigger and therefore harder to find pre-made, and additional blocking is required for the rail mounts. With the deepish notches  to accomodate the required deck slope, Romeo's beams must be reinforced by steel flitch plates, which Juliet might be able to skip entirely.

Yikes. Also Romeo's was no hour-long modeling project, more like five hours. It will cost more to build Romeo's balcony. It could be a few thousand dollars at contractor rates. So... Romeo or Juliet, that is the question.

Subtle detail: notice that Juliet's rail is higher than Romeo's. That is because Juliet needs to be able to lean way out and not fall off. Romeo on the other hand, needs to be able to lean casually on his rail while knocking back cup after cup of that strong black espresso, recounting the latest humiliations inflicted upon the Capulet gang by himself and pals.

So... which one should I build? Here's a side-by-side...

[Romeo or Juliet? There's the rub.](https://preview.redd.it/othwxhqdd63e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=226e3e3818ac06f94a9d03e65de8fefe69e43781)

I'm glad I made myself get dressed and leave the house yesterday. It ended up being a sunny day, despite the cold. I had a really yummy treat from the coffee place, with my coffee. I don't normally buy those things but yesterday I felt like I needed it. I also had a good browse in Goodwill and found myself a couple of new treasures. 

Lol, treasures - I call everything I get from a second hand place a treasure all thanks to a lovely lady I met years ago … I *should* write about her someday, perhaps I will … but not today.  Anyfuck, I found a couple of treasures, one of them was a cool elephant statue thing. I have this weird compulsion where if I find something with an elephant, a Buddha or something Japanese, I generally feel like I have to buy it 🤣 

I allow myself to have my little compulsions, I feel like there are far worse things I could be compelled to do - I'd like to think, if a scale of badness existed, being compelled to buy secondhand treasures would be pretty low on that scale. I've actually found treasures during my “secondhand Sundays” adventuring for the past 3 weekends straight! #blessed 

Dinner wasn't the greatest - service was kinda rough and the food just wasn't very good. But the company was excellent and the margarita I had was decent. After dinner we continued the festivities at another spot where I took a shot of tequila, only because it was my friend's birthday - I don't like tequila. 

I didn't get drunk by any sense of the word, I only had the one margarita with dinner, then I had one shot of tequila and half a beer at the other place. So why did I wake up sick as fuck, puking my guts out at 3:00 am? Maybe it was the food, maybe it was the tequila … who knows. I brushed my teeth and went back to bed and I felt fine when my alarm went off at 7. I'm glad for that. 

I'm glad it's a short work week, I need some serious time off. 4 days isn't going to be enough but it will be nice and I'm going to do my best to enjoy it. I have absolutely zero plans, I just want to lay low and lick my wounds. 

I wonder if I ever will get over him … letting him go is one thing, but moving on and getting over someone is entirely different. I never really had a hold of him, but I've released the love that I held onto as much as I can. I'm going to love him for the rest of my life, that's just the way I'm built, but maybe someday it won't hurt as bad. 

I hope someday I'll get to see him and speak to him again, his absence was never what I wanted or desired. I know he didnt love me anymore in the end, which makes me question if he ever did. Truthfully, I only ever wanted his honesty. 

I saw a quote recently that I really appreciated - “how can I blame the wind for the mess it made if it was me who opened the window?” I opened that window twice. He is the wind. Now I just sit here with all of my windows broken. There's no storm anymore, and the wind has gone to hide. And I miss it terribly … it wasn't always destructive and painful. I prefer to remember the warmth of its embrace, its gentle whisper on my skin, and the harmony we shared. 

I can still feel him at times … I hope that means that he still longs for me, just as I long for him. He's still in my dreams, he's still where my mind goes when it isn't busy. My body still craves him, just as much as my heart and mind do. If there's anything I can do well, it's longing after this man. 

I wish I knew why it had to be him … but that's just the way it is, it was always going to be him. I've accepted my fate and even if love isn't part of the plan, I hope I can still enjoy the rest of life's secondhand treasures.

They're not the perfect couple but they made it work for 39 years.  Appa was never the showy and vocal type while Eomma was like that too. Pero Appa makes up for it by making bfast and merienda for her everyday! He doesn't fail to protect her and he makes sure my mom was spoiled. I actually found out how spoiled eomma is when appa passed. How'd I know? Eomma asked me to do the things appa did... From waiting for her before we start eating, making her coffee, removing the shells and balat from seafoods, and even dragging me around the house for chores and mall cause she wants to go out. I've seen them fight and bicker like kids and be lovey dovey the next minute. I've heard of their sexcapades (fuck my ears and sanity... But that's how open eomma is to me and I'm fooking glad I never go home early when I cut classes). They were far from perfect but I learned that being in a relationship individuality matters. They both give each other time and space to do the things they want even if it means one really doesn't like it so they compromise. They showed me ""right one"" is just an idea and that everything is a choice. No matter how hard and draining things were and how easy it was to end things they both made their choice and stuck with it. 

Their story was a whirlwind romance. Appa was too straightforward and Eomma was the patola type and called his bluff. Dated for a year and when he came back he asked her to marry him. Before she could say yes... Appa already got Lola and Lolo's blessings.. she just have to say yes and off to the city hall they went. Appa went back to work abroad and came back this time asking eomma to marry him again this time church wedding. They were not able to celebrate their 40th pero just like one of dad's fave song ""It's not how long I held you in my arms
What matters is how sweet the years together
It's not how many summer times we had to give to fall
The early morning smiles we tearfully recall
What matters most is that we loved at all""...

1h03ai3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WattsFree4All/comments/1h03ai3/thriving_when_pregnant_a_better_business_bureau/,Thriving When Pregnant: A Better Business Bureau Complaint ,"I recently started to read complaints from the Better Business Bureau about Thrive. It makes me angry because in spite of plenty of evidence that it is not FDA approved or Doctor approved, Le vel’s lying promoters continue to make false claims that it’s perfectly safe!  They repeatedly tell prospective customers that “ it’s only vitamins” so nothing to worry about! 

Basically, Thrive is an expensive gimmick and there’s no scientific evidence that it does anything that their promoters insist. However, it can make people feel very sick and there have been plenty of instances where people end up in the hospital! Therefore, anyone who thinks that they might want to try it, really needs to look at the Better Business Bureau reviews first. I promise that you don’t want to get involved in this racket.

What  makes me the most upset though, is that promoters continue to market this product to pregnant women. I will give a breakdown of all of the ingredients in the patches later. Right now I just want to say that under no circumstances should any pregnant woman ever use this. Even Le vel specifically doesn’t market the patches to pregnant or breast-feeding women, and so I don’t know why it’s even a question! However, people continue to believe that it’s okay to take when pregnant when it definitely is not okay. 

Here is one example of what happened to a pregnant consumer who filed a complaint from April of this year, as well as how Le vel  responded.  

One thing that’s incredibly infuriating about their reply was that they said that they’ve never had a problem or complaint before like the one that the woman has posted. That is patently false! There are countless instances where people have made similar complaints, pregnant or not! 

	5/2024Complaint Type:Service or Repair IssuesStatus:AnsweredMore infoI was approached by a promoter from this company called level thrive. I was 7months pregnant at the time and this promoter offered me a free sample of the three step system. I asked if it was safe during pregnancy and she stated yes. She said she used it throughout her pregnancy and state it was just vitamins. I asked about the caffeine content because the packages did not state. She said all three steps totaled about 45mg. I took the vitamins as she instructed and 2 days later I ended up in the ** for tachycardia labored breathing and pre eclampsia. I do drink coffee. Once a day. I did not drink coffee while I did the three step thrive and I could feel already this had tons of caffeine! My father ** law also ended up in the hospital. He is 84 years old. The promoter told him it was safe to use even if he was on medication because its just vitamins. My father I laws blood pressure at the hospital was 200/99!

1h038zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadMachines/comments/1h038zn/30_whole_wheat_baked_in_my_possibly_depressed/,30% Whole Wheat baked in my possibly depressed Breville,"This recipe was modified from my old Black and Decker bread machine recipe book:

1 1/2 cup warm water plus a tablespoon

2 tbsp skim milk powder

2 tbsp dry cottage cheese curd

1 tsp instant coffee for added colour

1 1/2 tsp salt

2 tbsp olive oil or olive oil margarine

2 tbsp honey

2 tbsp molasses

1 tbsp wheat bran

1 tbsp 10 grain cereal

1 1/3 cup whole wheat flour

2 cups white bread flour

\- make a little valley in the flour then add to the valley:

1 1/2 tsp quick yeast

3 tsp Fleishman's bread booster

I like crunch to the crust and the bread soft and fluffy. I'm told adding the cottage cheese and bread booster both help with that goal.  I used the whole grain setting, dark crust, and 2 lb loaf settings.  I usually use the Breville just for the mixing and 2 rises and then bake in in a preheated Dutch oven at 400 degrees, 1/2 hr lid on, 10 min lid off as I've never been a big fan of having a hole in the bottom of the bread.  This time I baked my loaf in the Breville to make sure it would still do everything including the baking as it recently leapt off the counter during the mix cycle.  It primarily damaged one corner and bent the lid hinge a bit, but seems to have survived the fall intact. I likely had it a bit too close to the counter edge and it couldn't stop itself from jumping.  Silly machine.  I now call it Marvin.  Depressed bread machine aside, it still bakes a wonderful loaf of bread.  The bread is soft, the crust is crunchy, and it tastes fabulous.

1h038m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogTrainingTips/comments/1h038m3/husky_food_drama/,Husky food drama,"So I adopted a husky about a month ago, he comes from a fairly unique situation, his original owner passed away, the guy was older, and he had my dog for about 6-7 years, as my dog is 7. 

So, my dog is a wonderful boy, he’s a great walker, listens most of the time to basic commands like sit, lay down, give paw, etc. but an issue we’ve been having is that he has a bit of a problem when it comes to human food. I can’t stress this enough that it’s only human food. 

I noticed this within the first two weeks of having him, I took him out one morning, and some animals had gotten into my property’s dumpster so a ton of garbage was everywhere, including food scraps.. there was piece of extremely mouldy bread at the end of my driveway, out of the way that I thought it wouldn’t be a problem, but oh how I was wrong.. he goes after the bread super sneaky, as in, we walk past it, and because he’s a good walker he’s got space on his leash to go further… so he quickly darts to the side, grabs the bread and goes frozen, lockjaw and starts horfing it down while doing a snarl, before I had even reacted, he was giving a snarl. 

I wasn’t sure how to react, I hadn’t had a dog in about 8 years.. so I got him to sit by pushing down gently on his bum, he did sit, but he was still snarling.. just frozen, but now sitting. So I figured “Maybe, considering he’s hasn’t shown literally signs of aggression before, maybe I can actually try and get some of this out of his mouth as it’s obviously going to make him quite sick..” so I try my best to get him to release by squeezing the hinge of his jaw, far away from teeth, to no avail, so as carefully as I could I tried swiping my sleeve over my hand and tried to swipe whatever was sticking out of his mouth off to try and break it so he doesn’t eat the whole thing. 
Which to my surprise, he ended up biting the tip of my ring finger. Unfortunately drawing blood, I should’ve gone for stitches.. but it was too obvious so I just nursed it at home. 

But again, he didn’t show anymore “aggression” like that going forward, so I figured we were in the clear, just a bad day, everyone has bad days, it’s a new place, new person, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.

But unfortunately today, same thing sorta, left my sandwich in its wrapper on the counter, I put it up on top of my air fryer that’s on the counter, annnnd also put a chair in the doorframe of my kitchen (he doesn’t typically push furniture, he’ll just stand and whine behind it), I leave the room for not even 2 minutes with my husband very quickly, to hear my sister in law in the kitchen telling my dog to “drop it” so I come and check it out and he has my sandwich.. and of course.. he’s snarling.. but this time showing teeth and getting nasty.. unfortunately for him my husband and I aren’t scared of him, so my husband straddles him and tries his best to now unhinge his jaw to remove the sandwich. I warn my husband given what happened before.. and as soon as I said it, he got bit. Not as bad as mine, but still made contact, and alike last time, he didn’t really have much remorse, as in, didn’t immediately unhinge once he realized he made contact. 

So the evening goes on, sister in law leaves, and now my dog is squeezing himself through my coffee table towards my cat tree to try and eat the minuscule crumbs of cat puke that I can’t get off the texture. So I call him to get out, nothing, used a lower tone, nothing. So I get up to redirect him with his harness while still calling for him to go lay down. As I grab his harness we walk for a second, but we passed HIS food dish (that was full, even out sweet potato in for the lil shit lol) , and snapped back and nipped me on my other finger, once again drawing blood.

I’m not ready to give up on this dog, he has such amazing potential but I seriously believe that one day both him and I are going to find ourselves in a sticky situation because he can’t get this issue of his in order.. I fear that perhaps his old owners mistreated him.. but I don’t want to upset the family by asking if their now passed away father would hit his dog or mistreat him in any way.. but now it’s beyond home training as he has bit both my husband and myself. So we need to look into some proper training, but we don’t know hardly anything about his history.. 

*more background: a person was lined up for my dog after his original owner passed away, but to my knowledge he was with them for just under a year thereabouts, but suddenly rehomed him one day to me, for free, with hardly any knowledge on me either… the whole thing has seems very sketchy and my dog’s behaviour has been backing it up.. I’m planning to have kids within the next year or so.. this behaviour makes me so nervous to bring a baby into this home.

Any help or tips are appreciated, but do not tell me to rehome my dog because that will not be happening. Thank you. ",1,1732594552.0,DogTrainingTips,2,1.0,False
