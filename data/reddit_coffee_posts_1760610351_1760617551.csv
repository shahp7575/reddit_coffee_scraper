( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o84n2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o84n2h/please_someone_call_my_nameremember_me/,Please someone call my name.....Remember me!!!,"I worked the rigs in Midland County three summers running. Nights out there are nothing like nights in town. The lights go down, the machines keep their slow sea-sound, and your breath makes those little clouds that hang in front of your face. 

You learn to trust the man on the next shift because if you don‚Äôt people get hurt, and if someone gets hurt you don‚Äôt get to go home. That‚Äôs where the talk about the Tallyman started for me, low, half-joking, the way men tell the worst things.

‚ÄúHe shows up on night shift,‚Äù Old Harris said the first time I heard it. He had oil under his nails and a coffee in a Styrofoam sleeve, and he said it like he was remembering someone he used to work with. ‚ÄúThin. Smells like old paper and rain. Carries a clipboard. Adding names.‚Äù He smiled at that last part like it was a punchline. No one else smiled.

‚ÄúLike a union man?‚Äù somebody joked.

‚ÄúHell no,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúUnion man‚Äôs got paperwork that gets you paid. This one takes you off the page.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how the story got started: the missing kept happening in smaller towns, until the story travelled like a slow sickness. People said he looked like a man but moved wrong. They said his handwriting was tiny and patient. 

Mostly they said one thing that never failed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up: the instant he writes your name, you stop existing, not dead, not missing, just gone. Payroll shows a blank where you were. Your kid‚Äôs school photos have a hole. Your truck becomes someone else‚Äôs truck in the lot. Everyone else forgets you unless they saw it happen.

That last part, the witness rule, fixed the little logical hole everyone had about the story. If the Tallyman erased people from existence completely, how did anyone ever remember him? If no one remembered your partner, how would the story carry on? The rule‚Äôs ugly and simple: if you saw the Tallyman writing a name, if you saw someone vanish in front of you, you remember. You remember the thing that took them until the thing comes for you.

They say he was born at sea. That‚Äôs what the old timers added at the trailer, like an origin myth to make it older and more dangerous. Back when ships kept chalk tallies of crew, marks that meant a man was on board, storms would wipe the boards clean, the names lost to water and the mouths that should have called them. 

The souls that had no one left to speak for them pooled in the cold places between tides. For a long time, a lot of misery and forgotten names gathered there, and something formed out of it. It learned to count. It learned the shape of saving and not-saving. 

Then men moved from sea to land, chasing other fortunes, oil, rail, coal, and the forgetting followed. The Tallyman came inland like a tide.

We said it like that: a ledger made of grief. Nothing biblical about it. Just a man made of ledger ink and the world‚Äôs carelessness. That‚Äôs why he walks the rigs now, they said. 

Places where names get reduced to numbers on a pad, where nights swallow faces and the sun forgets to shine on you if you don‚Äôt show up.

When Pete vanished, I remember exactly where I was. We were three weeks into a shutdown, fixing a pump that had gone noisy on the night shift. The air was still, the kind of still that hums in your ears. Pete was on the catwalk, laughing about a busted hose, holding a beer he wasn‚Äôt supposed to have.

I was hunched on the catwalk with grease on my gloves and a flashlight between my teeth, when I heard footsteps behind me. The boards creaked under them, neat and sure.

‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù I called without thinking. The man stopped and said, ‚ÄúAlmost done.‚Äù

And then, Nothing! It happened quiet, no crash, no shout. One second, he was there, laughing about a busted hose, and the next the space beside the pump was just *empty.* The beer he‚Äôd been holding sat balanced on the rail, fizz dying out. I kept waiting for the sound of a fall, a splash, anything. Nothing.

‚ÄúPete!‚Äù I yelled. The word sounded too small against all that machinery. I walked the catwalk twice, checked below, even swung the flashlight across the waste pit. The beam just caught rain mist and metal. No footprints, no drag marks, like he‚Äôd stepped off the world.

I ran back to the shack, half-sliding on the steel. ‚ÄúHave you seen Pete?‚Äù I asked the guys on shift. They looked at me blankly.

‚ÄúPete who?‚Äù Harris said.

‚ÄúCome on, Pete! Two kids, drives that old Ford, always smokes on break.‚Äù

Harris frowned, searching his memory. ‚ÄúMan, you been pulling doubles. We ain‚Äôt got a Pete here.‚Äù

I stared at him until my throat closed. The radio crackled, some weather alert about a dust front, and just like that the conversation ended. Everyone moved on.

I tore through the lockers. His was there, only it wasn‚Äôt. Empty, unlabelled. Even the dent I‚Äôd noticed last week was gone. Payroll had no ‚ÄúPete.‚Äù Safety logs skipped a number, like a page missing in a Bible.

The next morning his truck was gone from where he‚Äôd left it. The lot had its usual confusion, folks forget where they park after a twelve, but this felt different.

That‚Äôs when the fear really set in, not the kind that makes you run, but the kind that makes you *stay* because you need to prove the world is still solid. 

I drove to the diner we‚Äôd eaten at three nights earlier. Same waitress. I asked if she remembered the guy with me, tall, shaved head, dirty coveralls. She blinked. ‚ÄúYou came in alone, honey.‚Äù

I saw Bob and Rohdy sitting there having beer with Steak. I asked them but it was like everyone just rehearsed the same answer.

I kept talking until my voice hurt. ‚ÄúYou worked with him last month. You lifted that pipe in three. Lunchbox had his name.‚Äù I named the job he‚Äôd done. I named the kids he mentioned once. The more I talked the more they looked at me pityingly, like I was telling a ghost story too late for coffee.

This is when I understood that every tale is true. I recounted the worst rule: if you *saw* the vanishing, you were the only one who would remember. And that memory marked you.

It put a ledger line across your life the way a stamp will mark a check. People would call you paranoid. You‚Äôd start seeing ledger marks in things you used to trust, photos, pay sheets, your daughter‚Äôs old library card.

You would be the story that kept the story alive, until the Tallyman came walking down the catwalk to your name.

I started looking for traces. I combed the truck lot, I combed the payroll, I combed my phone until my thumb ached. I found other things. A pile of old safety logs tied up in a box in the supply room with the corners eaten like someone had started at the margins and worked inward. Faded Polaroids with blank streaks. A lunchbox with a name ground halfway out. Once, in a drain, I found a little white bone, tiny, like from a child, laid in the mud like a marker. When I told Harris about it, he went very still and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go looking in drains.‚Äù

The nights got worse. At first it was small: hearing a pen that wasn‚Äôt there, scratching like someone filling a ledger in the dark. I‚Äôd go into the office at three in the morning and the projector would be on, showing a list of names, I didn‚Äôt recognize, a slow scroll of digits and shadows. Once, at the edge of sleep, I thought I saw someone standing in the floodlights across the pad, a shape pale as a ledger page. I blinked and it was gone.

Then dreams. Not full dreams, really, more like memories that didn‚Äôt belong to me. I‚Äôd be a boy on a ship watching chalk marks wiped clean, or I‚Äôd sit in a dark union hall as men‚Äôs names faded off a board. Each time, I woke up with the taste of salt like an old wound. Sometimes I felt hands like cold paper closing on my shoulders in the dark.

Pete was the first person I could prove I‚Äôd seen vanish. Afterwards, I started hearing about others from the barbs of rumor: a third shifter who‚Äôd missed a step and the next morning his bunk was empty, and his last name vanished from the roster; a welder‚Äôs daughter who didn‚Äôt exist in a photo album the family kept for years. 

Names started to look like fragile things to me, like paper in wind. I went back shaking. Every road sign looked wrong, every mile marker new. In my phone‚Äôs photos the seat beside me was empty. Even the reflection in the window showed only one cup in the holder.

For two days I barely slept. I started searching online: *oilfield disappearances, tallyman, men erased from payroll.* Nothing useful, just a few ghost-forum posts, a Reddit thread that ended mid-sentence. But one link led to an old newspaper clipping from 1958, ‚ÄúInspector Found Dead After Rig Collapse, Names Missing from Record.‚Äù The article mentioned ‚Äúa company man keeping tallies‚Äù right before the blowout. The reporter died a week later.

I printed the article, circled the line. The paper smelled like rust. That night, the printer in my motel room started up on its own and spat out a blank sheet with a single straight black mark across it.

The next few nights were worse. Tools shifted places. My radio would whisper names I didn‚Äôt know and then fall silent. Once, the rig alarm sounded at 3:17 a.m., but the panel showed no fault. When I checked the pad, the air smelled like rain even though the sky was clear. In the condensation on a tank wall, someone had traced a line down the middle, one side clean, one side smeared.

Harris said I needed rest. Maybe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. maybe he was right. I had been pulling doubles for quit a sometime. I needed all the money I can get to put my Nora in the private school. But this ‚Ä¶this is not the first time I am doing doubles ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I have doing it from the last 10 or 15 years. I never had trouble sleeping.

But this time when I closed my eyes, I saw ledger paper and thin handwriting crawling across it, adding names I couldn‚Äôt quite read.

I stayed late again, half hoping to see something that made sense of it all. The field was black, windless, stars sharp as nails. I was tightening a valve when footsteps came along the catwalk, neat, measured.

‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù I called.

A voice answered, ‚ÄúAlmost done.‚Äù

It was the same voice, I heard when Pete Vanished. And then I saw.

A tall, narrow man stepped into the floodlight. Coveralls, clipboard, eyes that looked like they‚Äôd seen too many ledgers. He smelled of oil and damp paper.

‚ÄúYou knew?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou with inspection?‚Äù

He tilted his head, glanced at my name tag, and started to write. Tiny, patient strokes.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

He smiled, friendly as a funeral director. ‚ÄúTallyman,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI count what stays.‚Äù

His voice had that dry paper-on-paper sound. He closed the clipboard softly and nodded, like we‚Äôd finished a transaction.

I backed away. ‚ÄúWhat happens to the ones who don‚Äôt stay?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. He just looked at the pump behind me and wrote one more line. The pen scraped once, that soft, terminal sound, and the floodlight flickered.

I turned to look. The valve wrench I‚Äôd been holding a second ago lay on the grate. For a moment I thought I saw another shadow beside mine, thinner, fainter. Then it was gone.

He walked past me, slow and deliberate, boots leaving no oil print. The air smelled like copper and rain. Then nothing, no footfalls, no breath, no world.

When the lights steadied, I was alone.

It‚Äôs worse in the Nameless, the place he takes you to. When my name finally went on the list, it was almost quiet. I felt the pen like a cool stone press into the back of my neck, and then the world tilted, and the rig was wrong. 

The lights were the same but off, like a photo under a lamp. Men I‚Äôd worked with for years stood there and I knew they should be warm and laughing, but their faces had that ledger-smoothness, like they were being rubbed out around the edges.

Then I saw Pete.

He stood at the far edge of the rig as if he‚Äôd been waiting. He smiled that same dumb smile he‚Äôd had before he was taken. But the smile carried a weight that wasn‚Äôt a smile, like a man who‚Äôd read a bad book and finally understood the punchline.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù he said, and the voice was hollow, like something learned by repeating a word until it had no meaning. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a ledger. It‚Äôs a hunger.‚Äù

Around us, and it was us, but not the rigs, people from different times stood shoulder to shoulder. Men with oil-stained hands and sailors with salt lines on their cheeks and kids in little shoes from decades ago. Some wore the same rusted hats; some wore uniforms that hadn‚Äôt been used in a hundred years. All of them had the same look: hollow-eyed, patient, like folks waiting for a train that never came.

‚ÄúThis is Tallyman‚Äôs place. It lives off the energy,‚Äù Pete said, as if reciting something he‚Äôd learned in a class. ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôre transferred, you‚Äôre not taken. You‚Äôre used. Your traces get chewed down until you‚Äôre just a shape that remembers the pinch. He eats the part of you that‚Äôs memory. It hurts like someone squeezing your head every moment. You forget your children first, then your favourite song, then how to spit. They keep you long. They like to let the forgetting swell.‚Äù

I thought of my daughter and the drawing taped to my dash and I felt the cold reach up my ribs. Around us some of the figures drifted toward the rail and pressed their hands to the metal, looking down like men who‚Äôd lost something overboard.

‚ÄúCan you get back?‚Äù I asked him, because you ask the thing everyone asks when you‚Äôre trapped in a hole.

He looked at me like a man who‚Äôd been asked to explain his own death. ‚ÄúOnce, maybe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf someone out there remembers you enough to call your name. That‚Äôs the trick. Memory is the only bridge.‚Äù He sounded almost hopeful then, as if the idea of someone remembering was a small comfort.

‚ÄúWho remembers us?‚Äù I asked, my throat gone dry.

He smiled that dumb smile. ‚ÄúSometimes a mother calls her child back. Sometimes a son remembers his father. Mostly, it‚Äôs just empty. If nobody remembers, you unspool and then you‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ this.‚Äù He spread his hands and something in his fingers looked like a dust of ledger marks.

The knowledge felt like a weight. If someone out there called my name, maybe I‚Äôd go back. But names don‚Äôt get called in a world that has folded you out of. People don‚Äôt sing the names of those who aren‚Äôt their neighbor‚Äôs problem.

Then he said something I didn‚Äôt expect: ‚ÄúHe likes witnesses, someone to carry his tale. He gets his existence off the misery and pain we feel, when we tell of him.‚Äù Pete‚Äôs eyes went thin. ‚ÄúYou told them, didn‚Äôt you? You told them about me.‚Äù

I did. I‚Äôd told them. I‚Äôd been the one with the memory. I‚Äôd carried the tale in the way a smuggler carries contraband. And that‚Äôs when I understood the cruelty of it: we kept the Tallyman alive by telling the story. The only reason the story survives was because the witnesses exist, and the witnesses keep the ledger hungry.

Then I saw him clearly for the first time.

The Tallyman wasn‚Äôt a man at all. He was a shape that refused to stay one shape, a body made of black, tar-thick fluid that dripped and folded back into itself. Faces bloomed across his surface, hundreds of them, appearing and dissolving like bubbles breaking a dark tide. 

Men, women, even children, their mouths open in silent screams. Every time one surfaced, a wave of emotion hit me: sorrow, rage, guilt, despair. It was like standing in the middle of all human regret, the air vibrating with grief.

He moved toward me without walking. The air seemed to carry him. The sound came next, that same dry scratching, the pen that never stopped writing. Each stroke wasn‚Äôt sound but pressure, a vibration in my skull that made my vision pulse. When he stopped, the pain began.

It started like a headache, a knot behind my eyes. Then it grew. The world tilted and I felt something reach into me, not hands but gravity itself, pulling pieces of thought loose one by one. My memories went in order, smallest to largest, the smell of coffee, the face of a friend, the sound of a song. Then heavier things. My daughter‚Äôs eyes. 

My wife‚Äôs laugh. It wasn‚Äôt fading, it was being *squeezed out*, like something wrung dry. I fell to my knees, clutching my head, begging for it to stop, but the words came out thin, like air leaking from paper.

The Tallyman watched without eyes. His faces kept shifting, some pleading, some calm, some smiling faintly like they‚Äôd accepted it. I shouted, ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù The sound of the pen paused, and for the briefest second, all the faces turned toward me. A single word seemed to roll through them in one shared breath: *Balance.*

Then the pain surged again, and everything went white.

When I came back, I was lying on the deck of the rig. The sky above was flat gray, the kind that could have belonged to any hour, any year. The Tallyman was gone, and Pete was standing near the railing, hands in his pockets, his face empty of expression.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get used to it,‚Äù he said. His voice echoed strangely, like it came from a tunnel. Around us, more figures stood near the edges of the deck, silhouettes of men I half-recognized, all of them slow and distant, as if half-asleep. Their outlines were faint, dissolving at the edges like mist.

‚ÄúHow long has it been?‚Äù I asked.

Pete looked out at the horizon, which wasn‚Äôt really a horizon, just a gray smear fading into nothing. ‚ÄúLong enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou stop counting. He feeds off the memories. The pain makes it easy for him.‚Äù

I looked down at my hands. The color was wrong. The skin had gone pale, almost transparent, and I could see faint lines underneath, like someone had drawn on me in pencil and started to erase it. I tried to remember my daughter‚Äôs name, but the sound slipped away before I could finish it. The loss hit harder than the pain.

Pete watched me struggle. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt remember what you lost soon. That‚Äôs how he keeps you quiet.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how much time passed after that. Time doesn‚Äôt behave right there. Sometimes I thought I heard other voices from far below, whispers, sobs, fragments of laughter, all of them blending in a sound like running water. The world had no wind, no sun, just that endless low hum and the smell of oil and rain that never fell.

Then, one day, something cut through it.

It was faint at first, a soft static from nowhere, like a radio trying to tune in through the noise. Then I heard the words, small, trembling, but bright and familiar. ‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ Dad, where are you?‚Äù

I froze. It was my daughter‚Äôs voice, clear as daylight. Every part of me that still remembered her snapped awake. I could see her again, the curl of her hair, the necklace she never took off, the way she‚Äôd grin when she was trying not to laugh. The sound of her voice carried warmth into this place that hadn‚Äôt known warmth in forever.

Pete turned toward me, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúYou hear her?‚Äù he asked.

I nodded. My chest hurt in a new way, sharp, alive.

‚ÄúThen go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBefore he notices.‚Äù

The gray around us began to tremble, as if the air itself had become liquid. I felt something pulling at me from deep inside, a force that didn‚Äôt belong here. The pull got stronger, and the light changed, shifting from dull gray to something almost white. My feet left the deck. The others watched, but none of them moved to follow.

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù the voice called again. ‚ÄúDad, it‚Äôs me! Come home!‚Äù

The pull turned into a rush. The deck, the sky, the figures, all peeled away like layers of wet paint. For a heartbeat, I saw her standing in the kitchen, sunlight on the counter, pancakes on a plate, syrup on her hands. She reached for me, smiling, her hand small and real and warm.

Then everything shook. The kitchen flickered. Her face blurred into white, then black, then white again. Somewhere behind it all I heard a faint scratch, the sound of a pen finishing its line.

Everything went quiet.

Maybe she pulled me out. Maybe that was just the last flicker of my mind, trying to give shape to the light before it went out. I don‚Äôt know. I only know that for a moment, I felt something that wasn‚Äôt pain.

My mood is completely different - I am so much calmer, less irritable and more patient. This was previously a big problem, very impatient and irritable all the time. My body feels much cleaner and I have more natural energy. My blood pressure is consistently improved now as well.

Despite some of the finest grind settings on my grinder, I am still not getting shots into the 25-30 sec range and can't even get past step 1 of dialling in my beans.

I have previosuly really struggled to get anything light roasted dialed in succesfully at all so I bought 1kg of some fairly cheap, dark roasted espresso beans to start with something 'easy' enough to get me understanding the basics.

I've had my espresso machine for years but really never satisfyingly felt I really could use it even on a basic level - so I recently installed a PID to try and make things a bit easier but despite this I'm still struggling.

Currently using some Lidl barista dark roasted beans to try and get started again with something 'easy'.

My setup:

* Gaggia classic (2013) with Shades of Coffee PID installed
* Sage smart grinder pro
* Naked portafilter, 18G VST basket.

Shots:

* Puck prep - grinding into blind shaker, 4-5 seconds of shaking and then tapping into naked portafilter, then a basic tamper (as consistently as possible)
* Brew temp 93, machine and grouphead fully warmed up
* 18g in 40g out
* Grinder is set to almost as fine as the grinder can go (internal burr setting 2, grinder seting is at 2)

Despite this I am STILL only pulling shots in under 20 seconds. They taste...fine but fairly bitter (granted this is mediocre coffee I'm using)

They are not gushing in a particularly crazy way and aren't very obviously chanelling all over the place.

What's my issue here?

Bad grinder?

Bad puck prep?

Idiocy?

Do I just have to crank my grinder down as low as it will possible go?

I usually just have a cooler bag with ice packs but it's annoying to zip and unzip in the night and bulky on my bedside table. I bought a smaller bottle bag and was using those insulin ice packs and that took up less room but it still kinda annoying and loud. 

Next up I was thinking of using an insulated coffee cup/water bottle with some reusable ice cubes in there? So I could just have the frozen cubes in there and pour what I express straight in? Then at least it would just be one water bottle. 

I've seen the Momcozy coolers but not sure I can justify the price for just my laziness of not wanting to go upstairs, and even the dupes are expensive. I've bought a lot of baby junk already lol.

1o84ib0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1o84ib0/inhumane_guests/,Inhumane Guests,"Two days ago I visited the park and witnessed something so vile and disgusting I could not believe my eyes. I am local and have visited the parks way too many times to count. Third time experiencing Epic Universe which of course meant riding Stardust Racers.

I was about 5 minutes from the shotgun gates at yellows station when a guest was returning and pretended to be unconscious by being slumped over his restraint. Once the RV came to a stop, team members panicked and rushed over the guest whom which sat up like nothing was wrong. Grown adults too at that.

I go back in line to ride the green side and the identical situation happened but it was an entire different group of guests. As someone who loves these attractions and creativity behind them this made me realize that a lot of people are weird and disgusting human beings. 

I have sat and watched people talk about the situation since it happened and 80% of people were mocking the gentleman. I understand that people will talk about you even when you are in your grave but good lord how evil do you have to be to do something like that? 

Personally I would never allow those types of guests back into the park since actions should present similar consequences. I know others may have different opinions  about the situation but we could at least all agree that pretending to experience a medical emergency after a fatal one has occurred is definitely inhumane. I don't wish bad on anyone but really hope those people have a bad week at work. Like the coffee machine breaks or a printer smudge's ink on what they were trying to print.

Thought I would bring this up to potentially warn guests who plan on experiencing this attraction to be prepared. After speaking to a team member this has been happening almost everyday since the ride has reopened. If somehow this message makes it to those who were out plan on doing something like I mentioned please be the change you would like to see. 

Have a great day everyone and remember to remain positive in situations like these. ",21,1760616849.0,UniversalOrlando,4,0.96,False

Earlier this year I moved from a big city to a small one, to live with my boyfriend. I immediately missed the big city and started thinking of ways to come back to it as often. At first I made a profile on rover and similar apps, but pretty quickly wanted to housesit without the apps taking a cut of my profits. I decided to also start a petsitting&dog walking business in the place I live now as well, I figured if I get dog walking clients, my bf can cover the walking when I do housesits in the big city.

I approached marketing differently for both places, focusing on different demographics.

Big city - I focused on younger people with pets. 

* Made a stylish canva website
* Instead of a facebook page, I created an instagram one and made sure I post regularly with hashtags so people can find me when they look for petsitting in their city on ig.
* In addition to posting photos of pets I'm sitting, I would also get chatgpt to write a post like ""5 things you should know about petsitting"" and post it
* I followed pet focused business on ig, and pet friendly restaurants and such. Commented a lot on their photos of animals.
* Found facebook groups for making friends in that city that allowed advertising from local businesses,
* I even posted in those groups pretending to look for friends, and made sure to mention my business in the post
* Offered discounts for first time clients and for those who were refered by their friends
* Paid a micro influencer to post on her story pretending she booked me to sit for her dog and is recommending me to other people lol

Small city - I focused on boomers.

* Made a facebook and next door business page.
* Lived on next door. Every day I scrolled through all of the posts there in case someone posted looking for a dog walker/sitter, and responded to all of them, even if a bunch of people already responded. At first I was discoured because there seemed to a dog walking&pet sitting business on every corner so it seemed oversaturated, but there is no shortage of people with dogs.
* Made flyers and left them in dog groomers, coffee shops etc. 
* Paid for facebook ads.
* Offered discounts for first bookings in exhange for a review on the facebook page.
* Presented my bf as my employee who covers the walking if I am away or sick, in order to seem more professional.",1,1760616750.0,petsitting,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

My meal prep protocol consists of very lightly spiced chicken and plain boiled white rice, 4 meals a day with a 3-hour gap between each meal.

This goes well most of the time with no vomiting, but there is one thing I‚Äôve noticed that even with such a strict diet I‚Äôd still get nausea sometimes that might lead to vomiting. This has been the situation for the past 3 weeks as they were a living hell for me in terms of vomiting. I would vomit literally within ten minutes of eating my meals and realized that it‚Äôs either my morning oat milk latte that might disrupt my digestion or just my body is not responding well to carbs.


Long story short, 2 days ago I decided to eliminate carbs, cut coffee, and stick to a carnivore diet. I have been able to digest food that I would never be able to handle while consuming carbs. I am talking about a 300 gms ribeye cut with good amounts of fat in it or 3 whole eggs with chicken breasts at late evening times and sleep in peace with zero nausea or vomiting. My performance in the gym dropped a bit, but I read that this is a natural response since my body is used to using stored glycogen. I am determined to continue with this diet and give it a chance since it‚Äôs too early to judge.

Ah, I used to be a morning person. Loved it. Even now, if I manage to get over the initial hurdle, I often focus better in the morning and early day. HOWEVER, fairly recently my wraith-self has taken over my mornings. And let me tell you, she's difficult to deal with. Super tired and heavy, moody. Nothing really feels worth doing or motivating. Quick to self-blame and pity. Can't focus very well. I feel bad for her, I do, but she's doing none of us a favor by being in the driver's seat.

Particularly the lack of motivation for anything is hard. The nice ritual of a cup of coffee in the morning and my meds do help, but only to an extent, and not every day. I think the approach of seasonal moodiness also strengthens the wraith these days.

Any tips that have worked for you guys? I have lots of things I want to do, like an upcoming research project, personal art projects, stuff around the house, studies and whatnot - but the wraith is making it very difficult! I want to show her compassion as well though, so be gentle if you can.

I‚Äôm new to this and was hoping someone could give me a hand.

I‚Äôve been trying to get an espresso-style brew from the Aeropress using the **inverted method**, but my shots keep coming out **really bitter**.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing:

* Grinder: **K6**
* First attempt: **65 clicks**, **18g coffee**, **90g water**
* Preheat Aeropress while grinding
* Add coffee, pour water, **stir gently for 5 seconds**, **steep 1 minute**, then **plunge**

This method gives me a strong but **bitter** cup. I‚Äôve tried adjusting grind size and reducing steep time slightly, but the result is basically the same. Some shots are more bitter, others a bit less, but even the ‚Äúbest‚Äù ones **never had any clarity** ‚Äî just a heavy, dull taste.

Yesterday, I tried going to the **opposite end**:

* **85 clicks** (much coarser)
* **Double paper filter**
* Same preheat routine
* **Stir for \~5 seconds**, then **plunge immediately (20‚Äì30s)**

This time, there was **no bitterness at all**, but the coffee tasted **extremely flat and muted** ‚Äî I‚Äôm guessing that means **under-extracted**.

Do you think I should try a **30-second steep** next? Or could there be something else affecting the taste?

For context, I don‚Äôt have a variable-temperature kettle ‚Äî just a regular electric one. I let it boil, then wait about **1 minute** before pouring to let the water cool down a bit.

Wake up, scroll for an hour, go to work, come home, order food, binge whatever show everyone was talking about, sleep. Weekends I'd hang out with people, but I was always just there. The listener. The person who laughed at everyone's jokes and asked follow-up questions. Never the one with stories to tell.

I thought I was being a good friend. Really I was just hiding behind other people's lives because I didn't have one of my own.

The moment that broke me was random. I was at a dinner party and someone asked what I'd been up to. I opened my mouth and realized I had nothing to say. ""Just work, you know. Same old stuff."" Meanwhile everyone else was talking about trips they'd taken, projects they'd started, things they were learning. I felt invisible.

That night I decided something had to change. I couldn't keep living like an extra in someone else's movie.

I started small. The next morning I didn't touch my phone for the first hour. Instead I made coffee slowly and sat on my balcony. It felt uncomfortable. My brain kept screaming for stimulation. But I sat there anyway.

That weekend I didn't wait for an invitation. I went to a museum alone. Walked through the exhibits at my own pace. Bought a postcard of a painting I liked. It was weird being there by myself but also kind of freeing. Nobody to perform for. Just me and whatever caught my attention.

A week later I signed up for a cooking class. I'm terrible at cooking but that wasn't the point. The point was doing something instead of watching other people do things.

It's been eight months now. I started running in the mornings, joined a book club, learned basic photography, and started volunteering at an animal shelter on Sundays. Some of it stuck, some didn't. But that doesn't matter. What matters is I'm finally living instead of spectating.

Now when someone asks what I've been up to, I actually have answers. I have photos to show. Stories that are mine. Opinions about things I've experienced instead of just consumed through a screen.

I still support my friends and listen to their lives. But I'm not hiding anymore. I'm not filling the empty space in conversations with questions because I have nothing to contribute. I exist now in a way I didn't before.

It's wild how you can wake up one day and realize you've been sleepwalking through your own existence. Just watching everyone else live while you sit on the sidelines waiting for something to happen.

I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around it.,"My boyfriend (53M) and myself (27F) have dated for almost two years. Over the past year, my boyfriend has been telling me that his past sins are catching up to him and that soon enough, he‚Äôll be incarcerated. He‚Äôs been having frequent meet ups with his so called ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù but has never provided any proof that he‚Äôs going to jail. No text messages. No phone calls, nothing. Two weeks ago, my boyfriend tells me he‚Äôs going to Tokyo for another lawyer meeting. I wish him good luck and that I‚Äôll be looking forward for him to come back. He disappears for a whole week. 
No messages, no phone calls and not even a ‚Äúread‚Äù mark on any of my messages. I start to worry. I called him and texted him nonstop out of worry until my boyfriend‚Äôs sister calls me for the first time. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to inform you but your boyfriend is in jail. I‚Äôll be taking his two kids and we will be moving to Shizuoka.‚Äù 
I start bawling. I couldn‚Äôt believe that my boyfriend went to jail and my heart hurt.
I told my mom what had happened and she questions, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt he call you?‚Äù ‚ÄúOdd..‚Äù
Hm. Yeah I mean that‚Äôs odd but.. 
I decided to call his sandwich shop that he goes to religiously. It‚Äôs his daily routine to sit and sip coffee at this sandwich shop. 
Nervously, I ring them up and mention his name if they have seen him around. 
‚ÄúOh yeah, he was just here yesterday.‚Äù 
My heart cracked a little bit when I heard that. No way. Is he deceiving me that he‚Äôs in jail when he isn‚Äôt to get rid of me? So I drove down there to find out the truth. You see, I‚Äôm in a neglected area so this took me two hours to get down there. I camp in front of the sandwich shop for about 3 hours. Then‚Ä¶ he shows up. He lied about everything. I walk in there and he flinches when he sees me. I asked him to tell me the truth and he told me he returned from Tokyo just now. I checked his phone to see pictures of him partying where we live. I saw text messages of him and his sister complaining about certain text messages I sent him. He mocked and laughed how sad I seemed. I was stunned and sad to be angry. 
You know that feeling? When something shocks you so badly that you freeze? Yeah that feeling. I guess my question is, why couldn‚Äôt you just reject me directly instead of making this whole story up that you‚Äôre in jail? Did he do it to not hurt me? I‚Äôm just so confused what his motives are.

1o83xbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1o83xbm/6_months_of_solo_travel_through_latin_america/,6 Months of 'solo' Travel through Latin America,"Hi everyone,

As per the title, I completed 6 months of traveling from Feb to August, visiting in this order:

Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Cuba, Guatemala, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina.

I thought I'd put up this update to motivate anyone starting their journey or at that intermediate plateau. (I won't really talk about all my progress up until my current level because I have made previous posts about that.) So, for a bit of context, this was the first time I had left home for longer than 2 weeks, banking on my spanish skills to pull me through this journey alone but, of course, with the mindset of meeting other backpackers and getting to know natives etc.¬†

I had previously used Hello Talk and got to know a Mexican girl from Cdmx who, long story short, I met up with her and stayed with her family. She was basically was my guide for the city. Of course, I was nervous, especially that first interaction, when they came to pick me up from the airport, so perhaps I didn't speak all too well, but I did what I could, especially try to remember how to use Usted to be polite to her parents. But what I found was it was really hard to understand her father as he had this really thick mexican accent, and it was funny because I could understand the mum perfectly so she would repeat the same thing but in her voice and I would get it just fine. But something I struggled with were the jokes and double meanings of things.

Anyway, to my benefit for immersion, no one could speak English, well, other than my friend at maybe an intermediate level, but she would only speak to me in spanish because she said it's embarrassing to speak English outside. So I was really able to learn a lot fast. However, what tended to happen is when we would go out to eat, I would almost rely on her to speak for me. I would be perfectly fine speaking to her, but I would kind of choke on my words a little by just saying basic food orders to the waitress. So we visited loads of different cities in Mexico, and I learned loads. Then we went to Costa Rica for a week and the accents there I found harder to process, especially this one guy who had a Carribean accent, it was as if I was learning spanish on day 1. The problem was my wallet had been lost/stolen as I was at the police station trying to communicate under the stress of losing it but also understanding this guy. Also, he said my friend was not allowed to come with me to speak to the next person and I had to try first on my own before her coming to help me. But after waiting in the waiting room in anticipation, the guy could speak English haha.

Okay, so next Colombia. This time I met up with one of my spanish teachers. I became friends with on preply and similar kinds of things, but we went to her grandma's kind of farm/countryside house to have an authentic Colombian experience, learning how to cook dishes, eat different fruits and make coffee that kind of stuff. In this instance, I spoke to her family in Spanish, but my friend/tutor was in English as she advanced. Then we went on this safari trip speaking spanish where I could, but of course, all the guests spoke English. Then, after that, I went to Medell√≠n to meet my other spanish teacher and, pretty much the same, met up with her and her family, did some activities together and was able to practice etc. I also did a one on one Comuna 13 tour with a spanish speaking guide, which I probably understood maybe like 85 percent of the history.

Next to Peru, so from here I was really actually alone and had used all my calls as friends, so in a sense, from that point onwards, it is when I actually had to really think for myself all the time. But I went on this Machu Picchu trek through Salkantay and became part of a group with other travelers, but I was able to speak to the guides in spanish and kind of find that bearing of speaking outside the comfort of the people I know. Also, traveling to other cities and navigating solo, for example, doing the rainbow mountain, I decided to go into a Spanish-only group to get the cheaper deal and I actually did great. I made friends with the people in my group, and I was able to express my thoughts just fine. Oh and just an additonal story I was reported as a missing person in peru and the Uk LOL as I had lost my data connection for a couple days whilst hiking to salkantay and my mum thought something had happened to me. (Even though I told her I was doing it looool) But luckily it hadn't been fully reported as they said to wait a little while longer.

Cuba Well, I said all my calls to friends were done, but my cousin and uncle came as they wanted to see Cuba, but they didn't know Spanish, so this time they were relying on me. I think here is when I really found my groove for the language. I was having full-blown conversations with random cubans on the street, with staff members, getting a haircut, all of that, as again, English was not really spoken, you just have to lock in and find that rhythm for it.

Guatemala, I traveled around and spoke to people fine, and then I went to a school to teach kids English, which was a really dope experience, especially being able to communicate with the students if they didn't understand a concept or something. I was able to translate into spanish with not many problems as I was teaching beginner to intermediate students. That experience was really rewarding and made it feel worth the struggle to learn the language to give others the opportunity to learn English, which can really change someone's life in this world. So I would also speak to all the staff in spanish and, yeah, it was just great.

Bolivia, again, was moving around speaking to people as I went, but the main points were speaking with the guide on our Amazon Forest trip and even negotiating with him for a better price, as he had messed us about a little originally. ¬†Then I went on this Death Valley bike tour with Spanish-speaking people from different countries and then a few English-speaking people, and I was actually the translator for the two different groups! Which actually felt awesome. By this point, people saw me as the go-to guy for speaking spanish to the guides and I guess I started to embrace it more now than before. And then again, with the Uyuni trip ending in Chile, I was the guy mainly talking to the guide.

Chile, I went to do another volunteering placement in Patagonia after traveling from Atacama and Santiago and I stayed there for a month on the farm / El Campo. As people know, the Chilean accent is a lot harder than the others to understand, but I think I really did become intune with it by the time it was time to leave, as I was living with the family day in and out for a month with only one person speaking English as she married into the family. I think this experience really increased my comprehension a notch more and also confidence in speaking as I became comfortable with the family.

Brazil. Well, yeah, they speak Portuguese, but I found that, for the most part, they understand English more than Spanish, because I guess English is the language of the world. They tend to spend more time learning English.

Then finally Argentina, the same kind of thing, met up with people and some people who only spoke Spanish. I was able to converse well and also, because I love how the Argentinians speak with the shh sound. It was great fun speaking with them. Then I went on an igazu trip with pretty much everyone only speaking spanish, and again I was thrown in and made to speak and get to know everyone in Spanish, talking about all different topics and things. Like relationships and lifestyles and all that kind of stuff.

Fast-forward to today. Even though I don't do lessons or really actively learn spanish anymore, outside of input from videos, music, and reading, I'm still confident in my abilities. For example, having a 3-hour debate with this other girl I met on Hello talking from Uruguay about controversial topics and debating on whose right. This has happened a few times, lol, and I have actually started to pick up and use shh/vos when speaking with her prob because I love that accent too. Well, my favs are Prob Medell√≠n, Cuban, Argentinan/Uruguyian.

So, yeah, if you've made it this far, if you throw yourself in the deep end and force yourself to speak and be immersed, you will definitely improve by force. It especially does help, of course, if you make friends with people who don't really speak English, because then the common language is spanish, and you just have to get better at it.

Honestly, I don't know how many hours I would be at now, but all of that doesn't really matter to me anymore, as I have already completed my goal of being able to converse with native speakers whilst traveling, getting to experience new cultures, foods, people all in spanish. But if I had to put a label on it, maybe high B2 ‚Äî low C1.¬†

Thanks for your time and wishing everyone all the best on their journey. I am now learning Japanese!",8,1760615094.0,dreamingspanish,3,1.0,False

OpenAI‚Äôs move to allow erotica in ChatGPT for verified adult users is the sort of product pivot that makes consultants salivate and compliance teams twitch their chairs.

Why it matters to founders and indie hackers: permissive content equals engagement. Engagement equals new use cases, subscription hooks, and the kind of niche markets VCs pretend not to notice. But before you carve out your micro-niche ‚ÄúAI-written romance for coffee shops,‚Äù there are practical landmines.

Age verification: the obvious gate. If you rely on flimsy ‚Äúself-attest‚Äù checkboxes, you‚Äôre basically handing the keys to anyone willing to fib. Real verification means ID checks, KYC vendors, or payment-based gating ‚Äî all of which carry regulatory, privacy, and user-experience costs. Some users will balk at handing over a passport to read a fanfic about consenting adults. Others will welcome the friction if it keeps creeps out.

Moderation and taxonomy: ‚ÄúErotica‚Äù is a broad umbrella. What‚Äôs allowed? What‚Äôs not? OpenAI will likely keep hard bans on minors, non-consent, and illegal acts, but the grey areas (ageplay-adjacent, power-dynamics, fetish content) require nuanced policy plus human-in-the-loop review. Expect furious debates and appeals inboxes that look like confessional booths.

Privacy and vendor risk: Age-gating vendors will see sensitive metadata. Logs about who asked for what can be subpoenaed or leaked. If you‚Äôre building on top of this, think data minimization, retention limits, and contractual safeguards.

Monetization vs. ethics: There‚Äôs money in adult verticals. But monetization strategies (microtransactions, paywalls, verification fees) change user incentives and risk exploitation. Be thoughtful: short-term ARPU can become long-term reputational debt.

TL;DR for builders: this is an opportunity dressed in compliance paperwork. If you‚Äôre tempted, plan for hard verification, clear boundaries, human moderation, and impeccable privacy defaults. If you screw it up, you‚Äôll be in the same breathless article as the headline.""",1,1760615007.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False
1o83w16,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecureNetForum0/comments/1o83w16/vpn_power_test_2025_measuring_encryption/,"VPN Power Test 2025: Measuring Encryption, Streaming Support, and Reliability","In 2025, the internet stands as both a hub of opportunity and a hotspot for digital threats. It‚Äôs overflowing with entertainment and information, yet constantly shadowed by tracking, censorship, and cyberattacks. To safeguard my online world, I turned to VPNs ‚Äî tools that encrypt data, mask IP addresses, and unlock unrestricted access to the web. After testing several leading providers, I set out to evaluate their encryption strength, streaming support, and overall reliability. Here‚Äôs what I discovered in the **VPN Power Test 2025**.

# What I Look for in a VPN

When choosing a VPN, I focused on what mattered most for my daily¬†**operations**:

* **No-logs policy:**¬†I want zero records of my browsing.
* **Robust encryption:**¬†AES-256 is my go-to for security.
* **Expeditious speeds:**¬†Crucial for streaming shows or gaming.
* **Global servers:**¬†More servers mean better access to content.
* **Reliable protocols:**¬†Options like Wire Guard or OpenVPN for smooth, secure connections.
* **Fair pricing:**¬†Good protection shouldn‚Äôt cost a¬†**fortune**.

# My Experience with Top VPNs

I tested a mix of well-known and newer VPNs to see how they performed in¬†**practice**. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

# CoverMeVPN

I tried this lesser-known VPN, and here‚Äôs what surprised me: it delivered strong encryption and a no-logs policy that gave me¬†**tranquility**. Streaming Netflix and Hulu was effortless with no geo-blocks, and the speeds were solid for gaming too. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use for beginners like me, and still has enough features for advanced users. It felt like a great¬†**well-rounded**¬†choice.

# NordVPN

This is a heavy hitter I kept¬†**hearing**¬†about. Its Double VPN and extra security features made me feel secure, especially on public Wi-Fi. The huge server network meant I could always find a fast connection, and it never felt sluggish, whether I was browsing or streaming.

# ExpressVPN

This one was a¬†**marvel**¬†for streaming. I could access Netflix instantly, and the speeds were so fast I forgot I was using a VPN. The apps were super easy to navigate, and its Lightway protocol kept things secure without slowing me down. It‚Äôs pricier, but it delivered every¬†**time**.

# Surfshark

Surfshark was a budget-friendly¬†**victory**. I loved that I could connect all my devices‚Äîphone, laptop, you name it‚Äîwithout limits. It balanced speed and security well, and the price felt like a steal for what I got. It worked smoothly for both streaming and casual browsing.

# ProtonVPN

Coming from the ProtonMail team, this one felt¬†**reliable**¬†from the start. Its focus on privacy was clear, and I appreciated the transparency. The free tier was handy for testing, but it had limits on servers and speed. The paid version was much better and worth it for privacy-conscious users like me.

# Why I Won‚Äôt Browse Without a VPN

Here‚Äôs why a VPN became¬†**essential**¬†for me:

* **Privacy protection:**¬†It stops ISPs and advertisers from tracking my every click.
* **Public Wi-Fi safety:**¬†I feel secure checking my bank account at a¬†**coffee shop**.
* **Bypassing restrictions:**¬†I can access content blocked in my region.
* **Streaming freedom:**¬†I watch shows and sports from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure transactions:**¬†Shopping and banking stay private and safe.

**üöÄ Wrapping Up**  
In today‚Äôs digital world, protecting your privacy, security, and freedom online isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs essential.

Well-known providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark dominate the spotlight, but newer services such as¬†[**CoverMeVPN**](https://covermevpn.com/)¬†are stepping up with powerful encryption, competitive features, and budget-friendly plans. That makes them a smart option for anyone serious about safeguarding their online life.

Our kids grew up together until they were 3.5 but sadly they had to move away recently. 

I have tried to meet new people, I have tried groups but everyone seemed to already know each other and stuck to their groups, I have tried talking to mums in the park but I end up just feeling weird and annoying as they don‚Äôt really reciprocate the conversation, and I have tried a local parent meeting app and local Facebook pages where I have met a couple of mums but we tend to talk for a bit, meet for a coffee and then they fizzle out. 

I have never been great at making friends, I‚Äôm quite introverted by nature, but even when I really try and put myself out there it just never really goes anywhere. It basically feels like dating, or worse, being back in the school playground. My child is likely autistic and doesn‚Äôt have much interest in other kids/ struggles with places like soft play and stuff as they are too loud for her, so that adds another element to things and I have wondered whether that makes other parents less inclined to meet us again, but it‚Äôs a shame if that is the case because she is an awesome kid and often just needs a lot more time to get used to people/ to meet in a place that suits her better. Plus, I am more wanting to meet people for my own social needs rather than my child‚Äôs at this point but maybe that‚Äôs not how other parents see it? 

Anyway, I‚Äôm sure I sound pathetic, but I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone else is in the same boat? I love spending time my kid obviously but it would just be so nice to have people to meet. I‚Äôm going on maternity leave with our second next year and I‚Äôm honestly dreading it‚Ä¶ I have no idea how we‚Äôll fill a whole week with nobody to even go and see. Maybe it will be easier with a baby rather than a toddler. We do have other friends as a family but they either don‚Äôt have kids or work full time so if we see them it‚Äôs on the weekends.

Every populated star we cross, it‚Äôs the same smug carbon copy‚Ä¶ same faces, same credit system, and somehow they all invented pizza, and without fail, every one of them decides pineapple on pizza is a ‚Äòbold cultural choice.‚Äô I‚Äôve spent my career mapping the galaxy‚Äôs DNA only to confirm we‚Äôre a cosmic franchise for some reason, and every planet‚Äôs just another branch of *Homo Disappointmentus.*‚Äù

The *Flat Shu Lance*, named for its blade-flat profile and inspired by Shu, the Egyptian god of air, light, and wind, glided in on silent thrusters. Vale hated the name: a ship dedicated to ‚Äúthe god of wind‚Äù captained by a man whose career had become one long, disappointing fart in the face of discovery.

‚ÄúDecades,‚Äù he said, softer now. ‚ÄúWe crossed the dark just to find humanity‚Ä¶ some still discovering fire, others livestreaming it for likes.‚Äù

Sen tilted her head. ‚ÄúPerhaps the universe just enjoys harmony.‚Äù Vale exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúHarmony‚Äôs one thing, Sen. But the universe humming the same tune everywhere? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù

The doors hissed open. Tilda Foom marched in, brandishing an AI-Wrench and the remains of a wrapper like evidence in a trial.  
‚ÄúConfess,‚Äù she announced to the whole bridge. ‚ÄúSomeone stole my protein bars‚Ä¶ the spicy ones. I labeled them *‚ÄòTilda‚Äôs! Do not anger fate!‚Äô* Fate is now annoyed.‚Äù

Captain Vale didn‚Äôt turn. ‚ÄúQuartermaster, not now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were right between the pickled tongues and my spore-mayonnaise bucket,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf someone took this because the tongues whispered again‚Ä¶ the whispering is very normal‚Ä¶ yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt could be stress-eating,‚Äù Sen said gently and turned back to the console.

Tilda held up the mangled foil.  
‚ÄúOh sure,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause I always take neat, evenly spaced bites out of foil when I‚Äôm anxious.‚Äù

Sen gave her a distracted smile. ‚ÄúProbably a heat warp. Happens in the galley all the time.‚Äù

Tilda hesitated. ‚ÄúMaybe. Yeah, could be.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Vale said, turning back to the console. ‚ÄúNow, Dr. Elar‚Ä¶ the signal.‚Äù

Sen nodded and resumed scanning.

Tilda stuffed the wrapper in her pocket. ‚ÄúNext time I‚Äôm mixing the pudding with antifreeze. Natural selection can sort it out.‚Äù And left the bridge.

Five minutes later, the ship screamed.

Lights flickered. The gravity hiccupped. A coffee mug did a slow ballet in midair before smashing against the bulkhead.

Vale‚Äôs voice cut through the alarms. ‚ÄúSen, report!‚Äù

Sen stared at the console, baffled. ‚ÄúInternal fluctuation. Something tripped the emergency lever, but there‚Äôs no record of movement!‚Äù

Tilda‚Äôs voice crackled through the comms, ragged and triumphant. ‚ÄúI got him! I got the slimy little son of a starfish!‚Äù

Vale froze. ‚ÄúQuartermaster, these interruptions are becoming‚Ä¶ disruptive.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Captain,‚Äù Tilda said, panting. ‚ÄúHe fell for the pudding trap. Rookie mistake.‚Äù

Sen blinked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pudding trap?‚Äù

Vale closed his eyes. ‚ÄúAhh‚Ä¶ Of course there is.‚Äù

Tilda marched in, hugging empty space like a struggling cat. ‚ÄúQuit wriggling, Jelly-Grandpa.‚Äù

A dry, papery voice trembled through the air, vowels warped like English learned from a haunted radio. ‚ÄúRespectfully,‚Äù it said, each syllable wrapped in condescension and charm, ‚ÄúI am not gelatinous,‚Äù it said, ‚ÄúAnd you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre evolution‚Äôs petri dish, a civilization of mold.‚Äù

Vale didn‚Äôt look at Tilda. He stared at the nothing she held. ‚ÄúName. Origin. How did you breach my ship? How can a human be camouflaged so well?‚Äù

Tilda squeezed. The invisible thing wheezed.

‚ÄúI am Kxrix,‚Äù it said with disgusted calm. ‚Äú*Human?* Captain, I have flaws, but let‚Äôs stay civil.‚Äù

A pause. ‚ÄúOrigin, irrelevant‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt survive the pronunciation. As for your ship, Captain, I didn‚Äôt breach it. I *noticed* it. You built it loud enough to wake gravity.‚Äù

Vale‚Äôs eyes lit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not human.‚Äù

Sen leaned forward, voice trembling with fascination. ‚ÄúAn actual sentient non-hominid? Why are you here?‚Äù  


Kxrix whispered, resigned. ‚ÄúPerfect. I guess we have a few milliseconds to chat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink of me as sort of an observer,‚Äù Kxrix sighed, voice like dry paper folding. ‚Äúif I were human, I would probably be a zoologist observing gorillas‚Ä¶ unfortunately in this case, the type of gorillas flinging excrement and congratulating themselves on its trajectory. And, well‚Ä¶‚Äù

Suddenly, consoles shrieked. Sen‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúContacts! Seven‚Ä¶ no, eleven targets just resolved. Signatures are‚Ä¶ impossible. Negative inertia, braided gravities. They‚Äôre flying combat maneuvers... toward us.‚Äù

Kxrix laughed, an invisible, bright, mean sound. ‚ÄúHow quaint. Enforcement has arrived. You likely won‚Äôt grasp this, but the reason you only ever find human-like life is that higher beings find your kind‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ intolerable. You‚Äôre noise. Cosmic pests. Now‚Ä¶ what do you think happens when they find out you know this galaxy-wide secret? That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre here‚Ä¶‚Äù

Vale froze. His pulse spiked, half terror, half the giddy awe of discovery. Sen recalculated her life choices. Tilda put on her welding goggles. ‚ÄúWhat will happen now?‚Äù

Kxrix chuckled. ‚ÄúSterilization. You‚Äôre the universe‚Äôs rash‚Ä¶ time for ointment.‚Äù

The ships converged, their shapes barely readable on the bridge‚Äôs display. Vale lifted his chin. ‚ÄúBattle stations! Battle stations!‚Äù

Tilda whispered. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre telepathic, everyone think of soup. Soup‚Äôs neutral.‚Äù

The bridge held its breath as a cool light swept the room: no heat, just the clean click of an audit. It skated over Vale, Sen, the consoles‚Ä¶ and halted on Tilda, as if the universe had spotted a fire hazard.

Outside, eleven predators froze mid-pounce.

Sen turned to look at Tilda. ‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Tilda said with a wink. ‚ÄúThe vacuum‚Äôll cushion the blast.‚Äù

Vale didn‚Äôt turn. ‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù

The air around Kxrix tightened. ‚ÄúThey scanned the witness. They realized what she is.‚Äù

Sen whispered, ‚ÄúWhat is she?‚Äù

The air rippled once, and Tilda was gone.

What‚Äôs been working so far



Placement: raised to about chest/ear height, slightly toed in toward the seating, a little space from the wall so it doesn‚Äôt sound boomy off the corner.

Volume discipline: set one notch above ‚Äútoo quiet,‚Äù then leave it, no riding the dial mid episode.



Light EQ nudge (phone + Tribit app)



Tiny presence lift for voices (just a little bump in the ‚Äúspeech‚Äù band), and a gentle trim up high if sibilance pokes through. Nothing dramatic, subtle moves only. 



Where I could use your tips



Your go to ‚Äúspeech‚Äù EQ in the Tribit app, simple, repeatable settings that don‚Äôt make S sounds sharp. 



Any placement hacks that tame table reflections (coffee table right in front of the couch).



Night friendly routines for keeping dialog clear without touching volume once people settle in.



If you‚Äôve dialed in a comfy, low volume setup with the Lava, I‚Äôd love some tips.

1o83pgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcbayern/comments/1o83pgi/harry_kane_interview_with_sarah_shepherd_of_the/,Harry Kane interview with Sarah Shepherd of The Athletic,"Sarah Shepherd interviewed Harry Kane for The Athletic:

> Kane describes leaving Tottenham Hotspur and London ‚Äî a club and city that had been his home for so long ‚Äî as ‚Äúa big step from a professional and personal point of view‚Äù, but it‚Äôs one he has no regrets over. Speaking on the same day that Spurs head coach Thomas Frank says the England captain would be ‚Äúmore than welcome‚Äù back in north London, Kane makes it very clear he is happy in Munich, and that the additions to his wardrobe (lederhosen) are there to stay, for now.

> Before he arrived in Munich, Kane didn‚Äôt know what to expect from living in Germany. ‚ÄúUntil you experience something, it‚Äôs hard to really judge what it‚Äôs actually going to be like.

> ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a perception that German people are maybe a bit grumpy and a bit cold. But they‚Äôve got a great sense of humour and are really down-to-earth people who love hard work and humbleness.‚Äù

> He did know how big a club Bayern were, though. ‚ÄúEveryone pretty much supports Bayern Munich here,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEveryone talks about football, loves football. So even when I‚Äôm out and about or picking the kids up from school, everyone‚Äôs giving compliments when I‚Äôm scoring goals. It‚Äôs like one big community.‚Äù

> Kane says the move (to Bayern) has been overwhelmingly positive: ‚ÄúFrom a professional point of view, it‚Äôs been great to experience and to showcase my talents to more of the world. It‚Äôs helped me to become an even better and bigger player. The Premier League is probably the biggest league in the world, so you don‚Äôt realise how big the other leagues are and how big their fanbases are. Every stadium we go to is full. The atmospheres are amazing.‚Äù

> He‚Äôs trying to learn the language ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm in the lessons, I‚Äôm OK. But when I am out of the lessons and I hear them talk properly and quickly, I‚Äôm nowhere near‚Äù ‚Äî but is being humbled by his children, who are in an international school and picking it up quickly. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm trying these things, trying to fit in and understand the different cultures ‚Äî it‚Äôs great from a personal point of view.‚Äù

> Aside from friends and family, Kane says there is not much that he misses from home. If pushed, he‚Äôd say the golf courses ‚Äî ‚ÄúJust the different types and the privacy in some of the clubhouses‚Äù ‚Äî but he gets a round in whenever back in England. He also apologetically says he‚Äôs not a big fan of the coffee in Germany: ‚ÄúI do miss a good oat milk flat white.‚Äù

> The locals are likely to forgive him, given he scored 44 and 41 goals in his first two seasons at Bayern, and he is hitting an average of 1.8 goals per game this season. After the disappointment of a third-place finish in his first season, Kane played an important role in regaining the title (their 12th in 13 seasons) last year ‚Äî the first major trophy of his career.

> ‚ÄúObviously it was a long time coming,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of hard work from when I started my career to that moment. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of close moments. As the years go on and you get closer, it just made me more motivated to get over the line, to make sure I win the first trophy.

> ‚ÄúIt was a special feeling. We had a restaurant that we took over and just got drunk and celebrated together. Then lifting the trophy at the Allianz in front of the fans and being on that side of it for once was really special. I had my family there, my kids on the pitch after.

> ‚ÄúThose are the moments that make it all worth it. You work so hard throughout the year, you‚Äôre away a lot, you‚Äôre training a lot. To not have had a celebration like that in the 10 or 12 years I‚Äôve been playing‚Ä¶ it was nice to have that feeling.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWinning is almost like a drug,‚Äù says Kane. ‚ÄúYou want to do it, you want to achieve it. When you achieve something like that, you can maybe think, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôve done what I wanted to do and relax a little bit‚Äô.

> ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve gone the other way in terms of: ‚ÄòOK, I want to do even more now. I want to experience that with bigger trophies, on bigger occasions. Can I improve and make that happen?‚Äô.‚Äù

So I stopped by a gas station and swiped some splenda packets, and sure enough, the familiar taste of 9 splenda returned.

A few days later, I figured, ""okay, maybe it was a mistake."" Nope.

Today, I gave them one last chance, and no, once again, the coffee was too bitter to have enough splenda in it.

Posting on r/penpals is basically the adult equivalent of tossing a message in a bottle, except instead of the ocean, it‚Äôs the internet, and instead of waiting for some romantic beach discovery, you‚Äôre hoping someone who isn‚Äôt a bot actually reads your post.

There‚Äôs this weird rush when you hit ‚Äúpost‚Äù on a pen pal ad. It‚Äôs like Christmas morning energy mixed with the anxiety of waiting for your crush to text back. You refresh your inbox every five minutes like some kind of email-addicted maniac, thinking ‚Äúthis could be it, this could be my new best friend who totally gets my obsession with obscure 90s sitcoms and my irrational fear of grocery store self-checkout machines.‚Äù

So you craft this beautiful introduction about yourself. You list your hobbies (reading, hiking, pretending you‚Äôre productive), your favorite music (everything except country, which is what everyone says), and your deep thoughts about life (mostly existential dread disguised as philosophy). You‚Äôre basically writing a dating profile but for friendship, which somehow feels even more vulnerable.

Then the replies start rolling in. Holy crap, people actually want to be pen pals! You send that first email or letter with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever meeting a new friend. Everything is exciting! You write about your day, your thoughts, that weird dream you had about fighting a giant sandwich. Email two? Still going strong. Email three? You‚Äôre on fire. Email four? Okay, getting a little tired but still committed. Email five? You‚Äôre starting to wonder if you have anything interesting left to say.

By email seven, something horrible happens. The magic dies. Not in a dramatic way, but more like when you realize the milk in your fridge expired three days ago and you‚Äôve been drinking it anyway. Writing becomes homework. You stare at the blank email screen like it personally wronged you. What used to take fifteen minutes now takes three hours because you keep getting distracted by literally anything else. Suddenly organizing your sock drawer seems fascinating.
It‚Äôs the pen pal equivalent of that moment when you put salt in your coffee instead of sugar. You took a big enthusiastic sip expecting sweetness and instead got a mouthful of regret. The relationship isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ bland. Disappointing. Like getting socks for your birthday when you‚Äôre thirty.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from this tragic cycle of pen pal heartbreak: having fifty superficial pen pals is way worse than having one decent human being who actually cares about your random 2 AM thoughts about whether aliens would like pizza. Also, nobody needs a novel-length email about your grocery shopping trip. Keep it short. Keep it real. If your email is longer than a CVS receipt, you‚Äôve gone too far.

What I really want is someone who gets it. Someone who won‚Äôt judge me for sending an email that just says ‚ÄúToday I saw a dog wearing sunglasses and it made my whole week.‚Äù I want to send the unfiltered, unedited, probably-grammatically-incorrect thoughts that pop into my head, like pages torn from a diary that got written during a sugar rush at 3 AM. No pressure to be profound or eloquent or whatever. Just honest, weird, everyday stuff.

So if you‚Äôre someone who appreciates bizarre humor, doesn‚Äôt mind if I ramble about absolutely nothing, and won‚Äôt ghost me after email six when things get boring (we‚Äôll power through that awkward phase together), let‚Äôs do this pen pal thing properly. Fair warning: I‚Äôm probably going to tell you about weird things I notice, ask random questions at inappropriate times, and definitely misspell stuff.

I manage in-store execution, category growth, and product visibility across many trade channels. I take pride in solving technical and operational challenges that improve performance and visibility.

I‚Äôm motivated by challenges, by finding answers and solving problems that others avoid. I value trust, transparency, and accountability with passion. I lose interest in places and people that lack it. I value peace, balance, and emotional maturity.

I have a strong passion for creative work, especially design, marketing concepts, and product development. I like ideas that bring value, create shocks, and challenge the status quo. I enjoy revisiting routes others discarded and refining them through proper segmentation or exploring completely new ones.

I enjoy sharp minds and direct talk. I‚Äôd rather have one meaningful conversation; it shows how deep someone is and how at peace they are with themselves. I enjoy people who speak their thoughts clearly and passionately about what they believe in, discard drama, and communicate with no shame.

My music taste varies. I enjoy exploring new sounds and never get stuck on the same old tape. I don‚Äôt like being boxed in by labels or identity tags. I think it‚Äôs basic to define someone by what‚Äôs in their pants. I‚Äôm much more than that. I dislike mainstream culture, and that definitely includes Taylor Swift. I prefer originality over popularity.

I don‚Äôt speak with my parents. We‚Äôre not on good terms, and I‚Äôve realised I‚Äôm better off without that weight. I find calm in quiet routines, good conversations, and the slow satisfaction of improvement.

I like good quality tea and coffee. I‚Äôm not big on sweets, but I enjoy a well-balanced dessert when it‚Äôs done right. I spend most of my free time on my PC playing, building, and creating. I‚Äôm focused on building financial stability and independence. I‚Äôm mindful of my health. My curly hair is regrowing with treatment, and I‚Äôm keeping a closer eye on my diet.

One day, I‚Äôd like to own an ice cream factory. I want to create something that brings joy and comfort. A treat for any day, whether it's a dark day, a good day, or a cheat day.

I told my mom what had happened and she questions, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt he call you?‚Äù ‚ÄúOdd..‚Äù
Hm. Yeah I mean that‚Äôs odd but.. 
I decided to call his sandwich shop that he goes to religiously. It‚Äôs his daily routine to sit and sip coffee at this sandwich shop. 
Nervously, I ring them up and mention his name if they have seen him around. 
‚ÄúOh yeah, he was just here yesterday.‚Äù 
My heart cracked a little bit when I heard that. No way. Is he deceiving me that he‚Äôs in jail when he isn‚Äôt to get rid of me? So I drove down there to find out the truth. You see, I‚Äôm in a neglected area so this took me two hours to get down there. I camp in front of the sandwich shop for about 3 hours. Then‚Ä¶ he shows up. He lied about everything. I walk in there and he flinches when he sees me. I asked him to tell me the truth and he told me he returned from Tokyo just now. I checked his phone to see pictures of him partying where we live. I saw text messages of him and his sister complaining about certain text messages I sent him. He mocked and laughed how sad I seemed. I was stunned and sad to be angry. 
You know that feeling? When something shocks you so badly that you freeze? Yeah that feeling. I guess my question is, why couldn‚Äôt you just reject me directly instead of making this whole story up that you‚Äôre in jail? Did he do it to not hurt me? I‚Äôm just so confused what his motives are.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only 27. I‚Äôm only in your way for your personal growth.‚Äù Was this the noble way to go?

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

*You do not need to actually drink Monster, you can base it purely off the array of colourfully designed cans they do. I just want to see funny, unhinged or weirdly accurate depictions of yourselves and interpretations of the drinks.*

Hey friends! So, let‚Äôs chat for a second. You know that feeling when you keep hearing everyone talk about ‚Äúmanifesting‚Äù? It‚Äôs like, *‚ÄúJust think about it, and it will happen!‚Äù* Sounds amazing, right? But here‚Äôs the kicker: I spent way too long waiting for my dreams to magically appear, lounging in my PJs like some kind of goal-dreaming sloth. ü¶•

But then it clicked. I realized it was time to stop just manifesting and start *doing*. Here‚Äôs the scoop on how I flipped the script and actually started achieving my goals‚Äîwithout the mystical vibes.‚ú®

**1. Get Clear on What You Want**  
No more dropping vague wishes into the universe! It‚Äôs all about specifics!  
- Instead of **‚ÄúI want to be fit,‚Äù** go for **‚ÄúI want to run a 5k by summer.‚Äù**  
- Instead of **‚ÄúI want a better job,‚Äù** try **‚ÄúI want to land a marketing position in tech.‚Äù**

When you narrow it down, it‚Äôs like giving your brain a treasure map. üó∫Ô∏è Where‚Äôs your X? 

**2. Break It Down**  
Big goals can feel like Everest looming in the distance, right? Let‚Äôs turn that mountain into a series of manageable foothills.  
- **Daily Goals:** What can you do today? Send that resume, go for a walk, read a chapter.  
- **Weekly Goals:** What‚Äôs one small thing you can accomplish by Friday? Maybe try a new recipe or plan that networking coffee chat. 

Taking small steps keeps you motivated and makes you feel like a rockstar every time you check something off your list! ‚≠ê

**3. Build Your ‚ÄúSuccess Squad‚Äù**  
Ever notice how you‚Äôre way more motivated when you‚Äôre not alone? Surround yourself with people who *get it*!  
- Share your goals with friends or family. They can help keep you accountable or even join you in the journey.  
- Got a goal buddy? Perfect! Challenge each other, share wins, and support one another through setbacks. 

It‚Äôs like having a personal cheer squad, only less pom-poms and more real talk.

**4. Reframe Failure**  
Ugh, ‚Äòfailure‚Äô‚Äîthat word can sting! But, here‚Äôs the truth: it‚Äôs not the end of the world; it‚Äôs a stepping stone.  
- Instead of thinking, **‚ÄúI failed,‚Äù** try, **‚ÄúThis didn‚Äôt work, but I learned‚Ä¶‚Äù**  
- Embrace those hiccups. They teach you way more than your victories ever will!

Remember, every setback could be a setup for a comeback! üí™

**5. Celebrate the Little Wins**  
Ever notice how we‚Äôre often only focused on the big goals? Let‚Äôs change that!  
- Did you hit the gym three times this week? Celebrate! üéâ  
- Finished that book you‚Äôve been meaning to read? Heck yes! Pop the confetti! 

Understanding that progress counts, no matter how small, keeps your spirits high.

So, here I am, not living in a manifestation bubble but actually taking steps toward my goals. It‚Äôs not always sunshine and rainbows, but hey, it‚Äôs a journey worth taking, right? üåà What about you? How are you hacking your brain to get closer to your goals?

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üòÑ Have you ever felt like you‚Äôre just a walking smartphone, constantly buzzing with notifications and struggling to keep your head above all those emails, DMs, and TikToks? Yeah, me too. Not gonna lie, there were days I felt like I was more connected to my screen than to the world around me. 

But then, something magical happened. I decided to try a **10-minute tech detox**‚Äîand wow, did it change the game for me. Here‚Äôs how a tiny break transformed my energy and focus!

**Why I Hit the Pause Button? ü§î**

Let‚Äôs be real: 

- It‚Äôs exhausting being ‚Äúalways on.‚Äù 
- FOMO is real (What if I miss the latest cat meme!?)
- And staring at screens ALL DAY just drains your energy. 

I was dragging by 3 PM like a zombie on a coffee run. So, I figured **10 minutes couldn't hurt, right?**

**What Went Down During My Tech Detox:**

1. **First, I set a timer.** Just 10 minutes. No peeking at my phone or laptop. (Harder than it sounds!)
   
2. **Then, I stepped outside.** Fresh air? Weird concept, I know! But it was like a breath of life. üå¨Ô∏è

3. **Next, I stretched like a cat.** Seriously, no shame‚Äîtotally embraced the inner feline. üê± 

4. **And I practiced mindfulness.** Just focused on my breathing and the sounds around me‚Äîlike I was auditioning for a nature documentary. ""And here, we see a human reconnecting with the real world.""

5. **Finally, I wrote it all down.** What I felt, what I noticed, and most importantly, how I felt after putting the tech down. It was like finding out I had a superpower hidden under all those notifications!

**What I Discovered:**

- **Energy Boost:** I came back feeling like I could conquer the world. Seriously, where‚Äôd all that energy come from?
  
- **Mind Clarity:** It‚Äôs wild how many thoughts swirled in my head until I just took a moment to let them settle like dust in the air. 

- **Creativity Sparks:** Ideas started flowing in ways they hadn‚Äôt before. Who knew stepping away could kickstart my creativity?

- **Connection Over Disconnection:** After that detox, I found myself actually engaged in conversations, noticing little details around me (like that cute dog on my walk!), instead of half-listening while scrolling.

**So, What‚Äôs the Catch?**

Honestly, there isn‚Äôt one. Everyone deserves a mini-break, right? I‚Äôm not saying you need to go full-on hermit and live in a cave. But **imagine** what a few minutes each day could do for you.

I have been stuck in bed for 2 weeks (i still exercise and move around, just a lot less because it's difficult.

I seriously don't think those two things should stop me from sleeping for 48 hours straight though. I'm exhausted (i haven't eaten in 2 days either because i completely lost my appetite so im extra exhausted) and i just want to sleep. 
For now I'm just not taking my adhd meds, drinking coffee, or drinking excessive caffeine. I'm still extremely stressed because I've missed school and have schoolwork to make up and am dealing with some personal issues, but still wtf???
I have a doctor's appointment today (post-op) so I'll ask about it but holy shit I'm so miserable.

This past Sunday, I (M23) met a girl around my age (I didn‚Äôt ask exactly how old she is) during an event that lasted all day. We ended up talking pretty much the whole time ‚Äî about university, life, and all sorts of random topics. The conversation flowed really well, and we got along nicely.

One important thing she mentioned is that she just graduated from med school and has been super busy studying every day before she starts working.

Halfway through the day, I told myself I had to be brave enough to at least ask for her Instagram so we could maybe stay in touch ‚Äî and I did it! She gave it to me at the end of the day.

Now here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm unsure. Since she said she‚Äôs been really busy with her studies (and she said that before I even asked for her Instagram), I‚Äôm wondering if that was kind of a subtle way to say she doesn‚Äôt really have time for anything else. Still, I‚Äôd really like to ask her to grab a coffee or something small over the weekend.

Would that be too much? I mean, I did ask for her Instagram with that idea in mind ‚Äî to eventually meet up ‚Äî and if it doesn‚Äôt work out, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to be ashamed of.",1,1760613170.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Story :- 
Me and my friend (an old friend, who was my flatmate then) were going to get some coffee at Third Wave Coffee in Greater Kailash 2, it was his last day cuz he was leaving. While we were leaving, we noticed there was a tattoo parlor above the coffee shop. And guess which one was that 'Devilz Tattooz' (I was eyeing their insta page since few weeks back and wanted to get my first tattoo there only) . I kinda believed it was fate telling me to get that tattoo. 

I was scared, confused, excited and sleepy (i was awake the whole night before) all at the same time. Decided the tattoo design with my Tattoo artist and got started with the drilling.

1o839s9,https://i.redd.it/bk15yg6digvf1.jpeg,Whoop & it‚Äôs impact for me in the last 2+ months.,"I have been using the Whoop 5 for just over 2 months now.

Switched from my AWU2 mainly because I wanted a tracker without a display and I still wanted to wear my watches and  to focus more on recovery/sleep and try my best to getting healthier.

I kind of knew that coffee, occasional beers, and late night snacks were affecting me but seeing it in the data really made it sink in. I started to notice patterns and made some changes like no caffeine after 3pm, only had a couple pints of beer in the last two months and completely cut out late night snacking (if hungry at late evening I drink water now!) 
Now I try to wake up at the same time even on weekends 

Not getting too personal, but I have a family history of cholesterol issues and heart attacks (dad and both grandparents) so I‚Äôm just giving myself a better shot long term with these data. 

Now, if my recovery‚Äôs yellow, I skip the workout and focus on resting instead and going for a walk . When I look at my country I am not even in the top 25% for strain but def now I‚Äôm in the top 5% for recovery and sleep üò¥ 

Overall, I‚Äôm really with my purchase and my Whoop age dropped from 34 to 31.7, and my pace improved from 1.7 to 1.0.

So, I was doing a ritual. Yes, ok, sounds all magical and crazy, but I am not one of those people who believe we can change physical stuff with magic. Could have happened in a church or during a prayer, whatever, it wasn't like I imagined for this to go. It's just important for the setting.

So, I had a pentagram on my floor, and in the very middle there wasn't a lot of space, I just had a little pillow where I sat, and I had a basket as big as a dinner plate with all of my items. So, I sit there cross legged and the basket is right in front of me. I close my eyes and meditate, then open them and want to start to use my items, but the basket is gone. I look all around and it's just not there. I started to feel crazy, like it was there right in front of my eyes! I stood up, looked around, nothing. 

There was no one in the room and the entire apartment. No one there to take it and if there was I would have heard. 

Then I look at the pillow, and there is the basket. I kid you not, the pillow is big enough to put my bum on it, not bigger. The basket was in front of me. There isn't enough space in the middle of the pentacle that is like a pentagon and the ritual required me to stay inside that little space. In no way could I move around in any way to place the basket on the pillow, it wouldn't make any sense. It was gone until I stood up and then it was right where I was just sitting. 

I have never experienced something like this. I accidentally found this subreddit and decided to share. I have seen a lot of stuff, but this one was so physical and weird. 

I wasn't under any influence, the room was lit by 5 big candles in corners of the pentacle, it wasn't very bright but in no way was it dark. I wasn't in some ritual trance, I was just beginning. I closed my eyes for maybe 3 minutes. I have done stuff like that many times before after and never in my life has anything like that happened.

I just get what happened. It's not like when I believe that I didn't drink my entire coffee but turns out I did, just forgot. There isn't a physical way for the basket to be on the pillow.",1,1760612904.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,1.0,False

1o833ty,https://i.redd.it/qox1r1tpggvf1.jpeg,"Community Spirit: The Heart of Franklin County, Arkansas","Introduction\
Franklin County, Arkansas, is a region steeped in rich history, vibrant culture, and an unwavering sense of community. Nestled in the Ozark Mountains, this small county is home to rolling hills, lush landscapes, and a tapestry of friendly faces who come together to create a unique sense of belonging. The communal spirit that thrives in Franklin County forms the heart of this region, acting as the glue that binds its residents together through shared experiences, collective hardships, and jubilant celebrations. This exploration of community spirit in Franklin County will delve into the histories, traditions, and activities that contribute to a strong communal identity.\
Historical Context\
To truly understand the community spirit in Franklin County, one must first turn back the clock. Established in 1833 and named after Benjamin Franklin, the county has witnessed significant historical transformations. From the agricultural roots that defined its early economy to the industrial developments of the 20th century, Franklin County has evolved while maintaining a strong national and local identity.\
The county's history is imbued with tales of resilience, particularly through the Great Depression, which affected residents profoundly. The tight-knit communities of Ozark folklore and traditions emerged as a form of mutual aid during hard times. These stories are still passed down through generations, often recounted at local gatherings, signifying a shared heritage and continuity that resonates with current residents.\
Natural Beauty and Outdoor Activities\
Franklin County is blessed with remarkable natural beauty. The Ozark National Forest, with its dense woodlands, scenic views, and numerous trails, provides an ideal backdrop for outdoor activities that draw residents together. Whether it‚Äôs hiking, camping, or fishing, these communal outdoor experiences foster relationships and strengthen the bonds amongst locals.\
The annual Ozark Mountain Folk Festival is a particularly notable event that celebrates the region's natural wonders and cultural heritage. Residents and visitors come together to enjoy live music, arts and crafts vendors, and traditional food. This gathering is emblematic of community spirit, as it showcases local talent and encourages participation from all age groups, leading to friendships and shared memories that last well beyond the festival weekend.\
Family and Tradition\
At the core of Franklin County‚Äôs community spirit lies the idea of family and tradition. Many residents consider their relationships with neighbors and friends to be an extension of their familial bonds. This kinship manifests in a variety of ways, from family reunions in local parks to potluck dinners that draw in community members of all ages.\
Local traditions often center around seasonal events, such as harvest festivals, Christmas gatherings, and Fourth of July celebrations. Franklin County‚Äôs residents take pride in their unique customs, often linking these traditions to their ancestors. The memories made during these events often serve as the glue that holds the community together, creating a rich tapestry of collective experience.\
Challenges and Resilience\
Like many small towns in America, Franklin County has faced its share of challenges.

You are such a kind, generous person who has been nothing but supportive and helpful to me since I met you. You don‚Äôt know, probably because I couldn‚Äôt open my stupid mouth to say it, just how much that‚Äôs meant to me. Truly.

I‚Äôve felt many times, when we‚Äôre talking like you and I have some sort of connection, like I‚Äôve known you before or we were friends in another lifetime or something?

I know you don‚Äôt need me bringing any of this to you, either directly or indirectly, so again I‚Äôm really sorry for how I‚Äôve mishandled your kindness, respect and friendship by doing that.

1o831ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o831ol/update_is_spending_5_nights_in_takayama_too_much/,UPDATE: Is spending 5 nights in Takayama too much?,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm wrapping up my final night in Takayama and just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who convinced me to stay the full five nights. It ended up being one of the most memorable experiences of my life.

Takayama may be small, but it‚Äôs an incredibly beautiful town, the rivers, bridges, and little canals winding through the streets make it feel like something out of a Miyazaki film. I was a bit worried I‚Äôd get bored or regret staying in a quiet place for so long, but it turned out to be the peaceful break I didn‚Äôt know I needed. I finally got to slow down, relax, and explore without any stress or crowds.

Some of the best food, coffee, and people I‚Äôve met in Japan were here. I found so many hidden gems that aren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere online. I get why some people recommend just a day trip, but honestly, you‚Äôd be missing out on the real magic of this place.

After Kyoto (which I loved but found overwhelmingly crowded at times), Takayama felt like a breath of fresh air. There are still tourists, but it‚Äôs calm, friendly, and feels genuinely local. I got invited into an elderly woman‚Äôs home for homemade udon, had the best steak of my life, found incredible antique and clothing shops, and met locals who offered me drinks or food just to share something with me.

I really encourage travelers to pick a spot on their trip and stay a few extra days, to slow down, relax, and actually live the rhythm of the local town and not feel the need to see all the tourist spots. It made such a difference in how I experienced Japan.

I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better way to end my trip in Japan. Thanks again to everyone who encouraged me to stay.

1o83196,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/1o83196/i_would_love_more_meta_progression_in_hunt/,I would love more meta progression in Hunt,"I recently started prestiging after around 2000 hours of playtime and I really enjoy it. Don't get me wrong Hunt has an excellent core gamplay loop and I still enjoy it just as much as I did in the beginning but prestige just added a little bit extra spice for me. Suddenly you are looking forward to finding weapon oil/blueprints on workbenches and getting lvl 50 Hunters feels even more meaningful. Same thing with the evolving Skins Crytek added a while back (Rookie-Suvivor-Veteran). 

This got me thinking: What if Crytek added more mechanics like this to the game? Could Hunt have something like a hideout similar to Tarkov?
In my my opinion yes and no. Hunt often gets lumped together with other extraction shooters like EFT, ABI etc. but the key difference is that at their core those games are looter shooters first and objectives are secondary while Hunt is designed the other way round. A classic Hideout could be a slippery slope where the benefits would make it mandatory to progress as to not fall behind other players so a Hunt-Hideout could only be cosmetic at its core.

My idea would be to take the evolving Hunter Skins and apply the principle to the lobby screen itself. You start with a simple campsite (three guys sitting on tree stumps around a fire with a pot of coffee etc.) and you can progress it with ingame actions and/or Hunt Dollars to something like a fully decked out saloon over time.

Just a little idea i had brewing around in the back of my head would love to hear your thoughts on this.

1o830jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o830jv/some_tips_for_spontaneous_slower_travel_in_japan/,Some tips for Spontaneous & Slower travel in Japan,"**Some context:** Just completed 21 days, this was my 4th time, my spouse's 3rd time and my daughter's 2nd.   
My first visit was in 2005, was Tokyo by winter for 7 days.   
2nd trip was with my partner, it was in 2007, and we did the 21 day JR Pass Autumn Scorched Shinkansen itinerary from Iwate to Kagoshima, with emphasis on Tohoku.  
3rd was with my spouse and daughter, 25 days, we decided to rent a car for 7 days, liked it very much and extended to 10 more. Emphasis was lots of small onsen towns and traditional ryokans.

Our travel philosophy is:  

1. Travel light (no checked in luggage, one small backpack each)
2. Spontaneous (no reservations in advance)
3. Off-beat (no major attractions)
4. If you like a place, stay longer

The idea is not to be cooler than anyone else, it's just to experience Japan closer to the way it is, meet less foreigners and more Japanese people & culture, spend less time in queues and more by exploring, seeing small towns and villages, trying different things and staying away from huge crowds.

The issues with this philosophy in Japan are obvious:

* Most people book ahead of time so whole towns may be almost fully booked
* Mainstream tourism is not catered for this style of travel
* Hotels can get expensive so mistakes can costly
* When we like a place and want to stay longer it may not be possible because of upcoming bookings by other guests
* Accommodation for 3 can be a challenge, as most rooms are for 2
* It can put other people in uncomfortable situations as Japanese people can freak out a bit when they hear you have nowhere to sleep tonight, even if we tell them it's ok
* Spending lots of time on booking, Airbnb during the nights looking for the next place can be daunting

So this is a bit about how we addressed these issues (THE TIPS):

1. When you get to a place and DO like the vibe, don't hesitate, ask the staff about the availability to extend. If it's not possible in the same hotel / guest house, ask them about similar ones.
2. When you get to a place and DON'T like it, but booked for 2-3 nights, don't stay there and suffer. You can ask the staff, explain that it's not what you were looking for, and many times they will accept, and may even be relieved (sometimes the staff feel that you didn't come to the right place as they check you in)
3. Finding places you like to stay in is an art in itself, and just when you think you mastered it, things can get a bit less great. So stay humble and acknowledge that perfectionism doesn't really help.
4. Renting a car is an absolutely delightful way to explore the countryside. You can just drive between towns, villages, stop in small cafes and restaurants on the way. See something cool? steer the wheel and go check it out. Just be careful, respectful, and don't speed. Avoiding highways and tollways is a great (and slow) way to see many beautiful things.
5. Follow the coffee trail: I personally love coffee, so when I study a place from afar, I search for coffee places. Then I look at the pictures on Google Maps and start to imagine myself there. For me coffee hangouts symbolize a lot: a place to relax, a place to taste the different ways people make coffee, a place to do some work on the computer, a place to meet & talk to people. Through coffees I can feel local culture (Japanese old style cafes with pourover black coffee and cheesecake) or international vibes (croissant and americano in Daikanyama). But even if you don't like coffee, you can do the same research for something else you love, but better if that's something quite common. 
6. Make no plans. Just walk out the door and explore. It works in cities, but also in small towns. Surprises are everywhere. Only today, on our last day of the trip flying from Nagoya, we woke up early and had a beautiful walk in Tokoname's ""pottery walk"", saw some nice cafes (too early for them to be open unfortunately) and some guy watering his garden.
7. It's a bit weird but in Japan sometimes you are in the middle of nature, but it's a bit hard to find a way to access it. That's because the forests are so dense and mountains are so steep. You may find a path, but then it just leads to a cemetary and then ends. So your idea of a nice walk may need to be changed a bit... It's possible and nice to walk in the rice fields (flatter lands), in towns narrow and less narrow roads, and search for little paths that may be hidden from the eye.
8. Airbnb can work well for finding accommodation for more than 2 nights. However, when reading reviews:
   1. Check out what foreigners have to say. Slow travel or not, their opinion may be closer to yours. But if they rave about something (""This was the best AirBNB I've ever been to"") it may not mean much. Pay attention to what activities they did, and not just how nice the host was.
   2. Check out what Japanese travelers have to say. They notice many details. However, their expectations and cultural angle may mean they like something that you can find less appealing. For example, we booked a cheap airbnb that had great reviews, I think Japanese guests really appreciated the low price. For us it was a bit depressing.
9. People may have the idea that Japan is a ""fast"" culture and that they do everything quickly. This is actually not the case. When you are helped by a Japanese person, and it may be in a coffee shop or information desk, they actually take the time, take the information, confirm the order or the question, and then try to give you the best possible service. It may mean that you will wait for your coffee for 10 minutes or more when the owner prepares just 1 or 2 drinks. When they bring it out to you, you will probably see why it took them so long. It is very often quite beautiful.

I hope I helped someone. If you have more questions about anything I mentioned, let me know and I will try to elaborate.

First concern everyone has .. do the bikes survive? Eight months in, yeah they do. Even with road trains passing, the vertical mount stays pretty stable. There's some wobble but nothing scary. The bikes did rub initially until I zip tied some pool noodles between them (classic fix). My carbon frame is still pristine because it only touches the wheels.

Loading alone is doable but annoying. I'm 5'10"" and can manage it, but my wife (5'3"") struggles with the top positions. The ebike (55kg) is a two person job unless you've got a ramp. Once you figure out to load heaviest bike first and work your way out, it gets easier. Still takes me 15 minutes for all four bikes though.

The hitch takes a beating. Get a rubber protector or the metal on metal grinding will drive you mental and probably wreck your receiver. Already seeing paint wear where the straps rub the frame. Nothing structural breaking yet but the plastic adjustment knobs feel like they'll go first.

Security wise, it's basic. Has cable lock loops but no actual locks included. I use two separate bike cables when we stop for coffee. Nobody's tried to steal the rack itself (it's heavy as) but I wouldn't leave bikes on it overnight anywhere dodgy.

Is it actually worth saving $450 vs the Thule? If you're doing occasional weekend trips and can deal with it being a bit agricultural, yeah. If you're doing daily commutes or have bikes worth more than your car, probably spend the extra. The corners they cut are mostly convenience, not safety.

So, I was roaming around Connaught Place last weekend, dying of thirst in this 38¬∞C heat, and my wallet was screaming because I‚Äôd already spent ‚Çπ100 on overpriced coffee. Walked into this swanky hotel nearby (won‚Äôt name it, but think 5-star vibes), and instead of buying their ‚Çπ80 bottled water, I remembered this random legal tidbit I stumbled across on a site like LawRato.com, edumaniax.com pr Fairlysettle.

Apparently, under the Indian Sarais Act, 1867 (yeah, it‚Äôs ancient but still legit), any hotel or restaurant has to give you free drinking water if you ask‚Äîno purchase needed. Get this: it even applies to your pets (my stray doggo friend was with me üê∂), and they have to let you use their toilet for free if they‚Äôve got one. Refusing is straight-up illegal, with fines up to ‚Çπ200!

So, I waltzed up to the reception, all polite but confident, and said, ‚ÄúHi, can I have some drinking water, please? I know under the Sarais Act you‚Äôre required to provide it for free.‚Äù The staff looked shocked, like I‚Äôd just dropped a legal bombshell. After a quick huddle, they handed me a glass of chilled water, no charge, and even let me use their fancy washroom. Felt like I‚Äôd hacked the system! üòé

Why This Is a Game-Changer:

Saved me from overpriced water scams (looking at you, tourist traps).
Perfect for anyone traveling or stuck without public loos‚ÄîNRIs, take note for your India trips!

If they say no, just mention the law calmly. Most places won‚Äôt risk a scene (or a bad Google review). Worst case, snap a pic and file a quick complaint at a magistrate or consumer court‚Äîsuper easy.

I‚Äôm still shook this isn‚Äôt common knowledge. Has anyone else tried this? Did it work at dhabas or smaller joints? Also, what other weird Indian laws do you guys know? Drop your stories below‚ÄîI‚Äôm hooked! üöÄ

P.S. Not a lawyer, just a broke college kid who loves a good hack. Check the Sarais Act yourself or hit up the Bar Council of India‚Äôs site to confirm. Now go save some ‚Çπ‚Çπ and stay hydrated! üíß",0,1760611909.0,LegalAdviceIndia,6,0.36,False

As any enthausiastic toddler with a new toy I would just use it and have a great experience, well no. After grinding some beans (15g, k6 grinder at 35 clicks), my water just ran through the puck, so that tasted very shitty. 
I had some older beans that I did not like very much (anearobic), and decided to use that to get a grindsize idea. I went really low, and found the puck was rock solid no pull possible, went up again gradually and found I could pull a shot in about 35s, at around 8bar on 22 clicks. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about taste yet because I did not like the beans anyway. 
Then I went back to my preferred beans. I settled on 22 clicks for the other beans so I started there, and again the water went straight through it (1bar max)‚Ä¶

Both beans are branded as filter, because I already had a v60. I  expected the beans to need a different grind size, but this seems crazy. 22 clicks on a k6 is pretty fine, do I srsly need to go lower. I tried 15 clicks with the other beans and was grinding for 15 minutes‚Ä¶ also it was extremely hard to pull a shot (8+bar for 1 min to het 30g). 
It just seems crazy to me, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is normal. Am I supposed to blast through 100g of beans to dial them in each time? 
I appreciate all tips on how to start off and dial in, I don‚Äôt want to waste so much beans just trying. O plan on getting a better (automatic) grinder for espresso but it will takes some saving. 

My method for preparing is the same. No preheat, read different things about necessity and didn‚Äôt want to make it more difficult so will start doing this once I can pull in 30s. Kinda shake the basket with grinds in there to ‚Äúlevel‚Äù, then tamper and make sure it‚Äôs centered, I apply serious force. Place the screen and push it down. Pour water (just off boil) at an angle and not directly on screen. Place basket. Start timer and lower arms to see the coffee at the bottom, hold for 5s. Press down to get around 8bar of pressure, attempt 30g in 30s.

Now, I want to reach out to him, but I don‚Äôt want it to feel too forward.

I feel like he‚Äôs probably not going to reach out again on his own I never felt this before I was always sure he‚Äôll come back but this time it‚Äôs different I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs just a gut feeling or my anxiety talking, and I haven‚Äôt been able to find him on dating apps maybe he‚Äôs in a relationship now.

Here are a few tips we‚Äôve gathered for travelers embracing the Readaway mindset:¬†

* **Pack intentionally:** Bring a mix of books ‚Äì your favorite reads, something new, and maybe one you‚Äôve been meaning to finsih.¬†
* **Create a ritual:** Start your mornings with a chapter and coffee, or wind down with a book and a view. Or both!¬†¬†
* **Explore local bookshops:** They‚Äôre often full of character and a great way to connect with the local community.¬†
* **Unplug:** Leave your phone in another room, or set a ‚Äúno screens‚Äù time to really get into your reading.¬†

Some travelers even build their trips around literary themes or destinations ‚Äì like staying in a rental with a library, visiting authors‚Äô hometowns, or joining a book club getaway.¬†

1o82stf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o82stf,Manager is a butthead,"I‚Äôve already made a post about him admitting he changed my clock out times for about a week and now he‚Äôs bitching about me calling and asking for a 3rd person on close bc we got busy yesterday. There‚Äôs skating rink right next door and sometimes they‚Äôll do an event and people will flood over to our store before during after this event. So we‚Äôll be significantly busier than we usually get. He‚Äôs trying to say the sales don‚Äôt match that statement but when you have 5-6 people in drive thru and front counter it‚Äôs hard to start closing work in a timely manner. We don‚Äôt get paid past 8:15PM and morning shift doesn‚Äôt seem to quite grasp that. We have a shit ton of stuff we‚Äôre supposed to have done by 8:15 and to him it wasn‚Äôt a lot of people bc he works morning and the morning crew doesn‚Äôt have the same responsibilities and the same time limit said responsibilities are supposed to be done. It‚Äôs completely fine when 12-1pm hits and they clock out immediately without making sure anything is stocked, dishes are done, the floors or lobby look nice, their ONLY responsibilities are getting the different drinks ready in the morning and then dealing with morning rush. The bakers have to bake obviously but they come in at 3am. Either way I would‚Äôve gotten a text this morning about SOMETHING it‚Äôs getting so fucking annoying. If I hadn‚Äôt of called in a 3rd person it would‚Äôve been text about how we didn‚Äôt get this or that done and we should‚Äôve done this etc. I‚Äôm tired of being expected to bend over backwards every night and do work on unpaid time bc the morning crew doesn‚Äôt want to have to do a couple things. I wake up to a text LITERALLY ever.single.morning about you guys should‚Äôve done this or you missed this. And it‚Äôs ALWAYS like one singular thing that we were aware we missed but figured ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small task the morning crew should be able to handle doing this so we don‚Äôt have to stay any longer past when we‚Äôre supposed to be gone‚Äù bc let me reiterate WE DONT GET PAID PAST 8:15 PM. So when I check the time and see it‚Äôs 8:35 going on 8:40 soon I figure it‚Äôs my time to get tf out but apparently the entire morning crew are cripples who can‚Äôt do any type of work. And what really gets me is they‚Äôll raise hell if they have to do something outside their regular tasks but they leave their shit for us to finish when night crew comes in ALL the time, daily actually, bc like I said when their time hits they clock out IMMEDIATELY they don‚Äôt finish what they where doing they don‚Äôt help stock anything before they go. The amount of times I‚Äôve come in during a rush and there weren‚Äôt any cups or lids stocked, no food, trash cans FULL but god forbid we do that to them. I‚Äôm getting really tired of the double standards at this job and haven‚Äôt even been able to touch up on how unfairly they split up our tips. Morning shift gets most of the tips and I get 8$? 8$. From 2 weeks worth of tips a FULL cup of tips. Night crew does majority of the prepping and cleaning but we get 8$ while people on morning are getting upward of 20$. And the espresso thing. I‚Äôm not abt to pressure ppl into getting something they don‚Äôt want half the ppl who come to our shop obviously barely like the taste of coffee considering how much cream and sugar they ask for. He‚Äôs already been riding our asses about this 2$ charity thing where if you donate 2$ you get a ‚Äúfree donut‚Äù I use free very loosely bc our donuts are 1.82$. If someone orders a donut he rings them up for the charity without even asking which is so fucking shady to me and I have more moral character than that bc that‚Äôs what he wants us to be doing as well. Most jobs these days are fucking horrible and they bank off the fact that you can‚Äôt afford to lose your job. Me and my bf are both working and he makes a lot more than me and we‚Äôre still struggling. I cannot afford to be put out of job but this place is truly violating tons of regulations. We recently hired a girl for a shift lead position who had experience at the same franchise but a different location and she was telling me once she finds a new job she‚Äôs gonna make an anonymous report on our location bc apparently they do a lot of things they aren‚Äôt supposed to be doing that they didn‚Äôt do at her other location. ‚ÄúShady‚Äù things she said.

I really want u all to read this please 

Last night around 12:30 am my boyfriend calls me. He said he was with his dad in the office due to some work and that is why he couldn't contact me since 7:30 pm. I asked him that did you complete the work with your dad and random stuff. He's mood was off for some reason so I decided to tease him. I said my friends saw u with some random girl (he don't have any female friends) on bike with you, where were you, huh. All I expected was he would laugh and say no dear I was with dad, but the irony was he didn't even flinch and took a pause for a moment and said 'yes, I was with a girl'. I was in shock for a moment but then I thought he must be pulling a prank on me. 

I started crying during the conversation so that he would just say don't worry it was a prank. He told me to come on zoom (we live almost an hour away from each other, we barely meet). I agreed I still thought he was pulling a prank. But this time he was serious.

I asked him to explain me what happened. He said. 'Day before yesterday I downloaded this dating app. I was very frustrated with my life. Idk what was I doing. I just got a match with a girl last night and this evening she asked me to meet for a coffee'. I said u went on a date? He was like no, the girl was already sure that she didn't wanted to date HIM (religious differences). I asked him did you tell her u got a girlfriend. He said yes. She even asked him what happened. But he didn't want to answer. Later he dropped her at her friend's place, the girl even told him to wait till her other friends come and they will go to play pool. But he felt guilt and he came back home to call me.

He then adds he was frustrated with his life.(he helps his dad in his business + he is doing corporate job + fights with her brother + I don't meet him). I am a JEE aspirant I'm gonna give my paper in January. I'm really serious about my studies so I can't really meet him as he lives far. But as and when I get time we zoom and call. Rest all is for my studies.  I told him to wait for few months ( till my exams). It's not we don't meet, we do but not regularly.

So he didn't know what to do. Everything came to him all of sudden. I even asked him that if i wouldn't have had brought this topic, would u have ever told me the truth. He said no, i was just gonna come home call u and act as everything was fine. As per him he didn't do anything. He asked me to forgive him and said he'll never do such things again. He even started crying. And he was crying for the whole night. Idk I'm just ruining my prep in all this.

All I'm sad about it is. He downloaded the app, made profile, swiped girls, talked with her, went to meet her. He was in his senses doing all that. 

Please don't be harsh on me, it's my first time posting something. I genuinely need ur advice or else I'll just ruin my prep. Thank you!",1,1760611184.0,CheatedOn,3,1.0,False

i don't have a contract and have been chasing to get one. apparently there is a contract now but i have not been sent anything and haven't signed anything. i also don't get pay slips which is a legal requirement in the uk. also have been pressuring to get this.

the main problem is the lack of communication about these important documents, my pay and tax, and the manager has been really stressing me out. i've been given extra tasks - but no supervisor or assistant title, no pay to reflect these extra things i'm doing, and if anything the manager hates if i do anything for extra pay. 

my health has been declining a lot since starting work here. my physical and mental health. the only thing is that i can't really afford to be in unemployment again. it took me so long to get out of unemployment, i also have medication that i need to buy on private prescription every month which is also something i need to think about. i just don't know how long i can take it for.

my last day on the rota is on the last day of october. i have a holiday in november that will apparently be paid but i dont actually known if it will be.

my dilemma is - work until 31st, get paid for the month, enjoy my holiday and see where it goes after. or - enjoy my holiday while maybe getting paid and quit in december.

1o82lld,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToyotaHighlander/comments/1o82lld/severely_dim_low_beams_issue/,Severely dim low beams issue,"Hi all.

I've noticed that my brand-new low beams on my 2018 Limited are severely dim, and I'm trying to figure out what the cause is.  Here's a quick timeline of some issues that I've had over the past week if this helps:

* I woke up Saturday morning to a dead battery.  A neighbor helped get it jumped and I was fine.
* Saturday evening I noticed that my low beams were really dim, and also noticed my driver side light was out.  I chalked the dimness up to the one light being out at the time, but the passenger side still looked pretty dim.  Fog lights and high beams work just fine.
* Sunday afternoon I change out both low beam bulbs.  Same bulbs (Sylvania Silverstar Ultra H11) as the previous ones.
* Sunday evening I'm out and see that the brand new bulbs are very dim, and I have to rely on high beams and fog lights to get good visibility.  I thought maybe the bulbs needed adjusting, but even shining the lights on my garage door is very dim.
* Wednesday I changed out the battery (I'd had the previous one jumped 3 times in the past few months - it was time to go).
* This morning the low beams are still super dim.  Fog lights / high beams are fine - just the low beams.  All other electrical components are fine too.
* Would a blown fuse from the jump on Saturday cause this?  If so, is there a fuse other than the ones for each individual light that I should check?  Everything was fine Friday evening - low beams had plenty of light.  My 'dark' driving is during the morning rush on highways so I can at least get enough light from other cars but back road driving is almost impossible without my high beams.

I'm scratching my head but this seems to be pointing back to the jump on Saturday morning and I just didn't notice anything until the evening since only my DRLs were on.

Anybody else dealt with this?

I‚Äôd like switch to something sleeker and more professional. 

I‚Äôm currently looking at the Aer CP2 and the Chrome Hawes. I like the rectangular clean minimal aesthetic of both bags. 


I was also looking at the Aer Go Pack 2 but I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews and the lack of a padded laptop pouch is something that worries me. 


Any thoughts?

In the tangled, spice-scented lanes of Lajpat Nagar, where the sound of a pressure cooker's whistle was the local heartbeat, you could buy a first-copy handbag that bled color in the rain, a watch whose gold plating would flake off by next season, and, if you knew the right people with the right whispers, a brand-new reputation. The colors here were loud: shocking pinks and electric blues of synthetic saris vying for attention against the dull grey of dusty pavements. Here, the air hummed with the silent thrum of servers and the scent of expensive, bitter coffee.
