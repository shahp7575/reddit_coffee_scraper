Looking for a fellow author to swap with and help each other! This is my debut novel and I'm excited to finally be in the Beta reader stage and get some eyes on my work. 

  
**Summary:**

In a search for clarity Fahim quits his job and decides to hike the Appalachian trail. Starting in North Carolina it becomes apparent the conditions are not ideal- his depression is kicking in, he's not running into other hikers, and he thinks he may be seriously lost. He stumbles upon a family living in the woods, a father daughter duo named Walter and Alyssa, that are both self-sustaining and working for the government on projects that have been handed down through generations. As Fahim gathers his bearings with this host family he's met with more questions than answers on what exactly Walter and Alyssa are doing in the wilderness and how against his wishes, his past will inevitably come back to haunt him. 

  


**First few paragraphs of the First Chapter \*\*Depression warning\*\***



*I wish I had a breaking moment to tell. That’s what people want to hear, the ashes of the fire, the phoenix. What it takes to pull a trigger. I thought moments like that existed too, and they probably do for the more impulsive among us. But that’s not what happened to me. If anything, I knew too long that it was coming to an end. Years. Decades. What exactly was ending, I couldn’t say. Some days it felt like my lease, my career, my long-term relationship. But most of the time it was my life, more indefinite as the weeks passed. Every miniscule moment evolved into a glacial press of dread, until all I could think of was how to get out of it, how to roll to the other end before it collapsed on me. I began wondering if a person could will their body to its demise. Stage four cancer patients did it, demanding their organs hold on another month, another year despite the odds. If that was true couldn’t a person then, in theory, will their cells to die? If surviving a lit-up scan of tumors was a documented possibility then there must exist an opposite. There must be a way to convince your insides to perish. To pause, to wilt, to pause all osmosis.* 

 

*To stop.*  

 

*Its more of a shock I never flipped the switch before. It was a vast, strange magic that kept me alive. I was my own lab rat study, intrigued at my ability to file taxes, call the dentist, buy groceries at the store, moving around with the same masked diplomacy all while wondering when it will all end, taking my last breath. Where had I learned resilience like that? Was it something I learned? Was that something a person couldlearn? Is that what Darwin meant, when he talked about natural progression, about each generation persevering the last? I didn’t understand this immense will I couldn’t grasp at myself, being the final voice to decide I will live, whether I like it or not. I would test these instincts, wondering if the time I spent in them would wake me from its slumber. I would create tests, aimless exertions, trying to find my limits. How it feels to stand barefoot in the snow for twenty minutes. Thirty. How it feels to dip a finger into boiling water until I can feel my heart beating in every limb of my body. I found that if I held my breath for too long something would come in and stop it, push me out of the way. I knew it wasn’t me because I would never have allowed it to happen so flawlessly, so unbearably perfect with an unwavering confidence to live. Because that type of thinking was never me, could never be me. I would always doubt if it was worth it to go on. And I would always resent myself when I inevitably did.* 

 

*This cycle continued for years until I learned that yes, you could go on living like this. You didn’t have to like anything at all. You didn’t even have to want to be alive. Your body just had to keep breathing.* 



*Most of my days were a silent struggle but I did have my share of outbursts. One day at work I yelled at my desk. Just like that, huffing and red faced, until my coworkers turned to stare. There was no reason for it, no broken phone, no printer out of ink. I just screamed, just like that. Out of me. It surprised everyone, including myself, and I quickly grabbed the head of a stapler to put it over my hand, acting as if I accidently punctured myself. Looking back it must have been quite a play to see, a grown man fake stapling himself, though they acted like they believed it. Some of them came up to me and ask if I was OK. I told them I was fine and that was that. A receptionist I used to talk to offered to buy me lunch or coffee. That was nice. But my boss, who had been several desks down, did nothing to reprimand me or point out the interruption. I thought there would be a meeting, an awful discussion of workplace tolerance and write-ups but the existence of it died in the same hideous way my voice ceased at its end; croaking and hollow. It alarmed me, the response it had. It made me think of other responses, to worse things. I made me almost want to do it again.*  

 

*In the same year I learned how difficult it was to get fired. Almost all of my reports were garbage. I joined meetings late, ten or twenty minutes after they began. I came in with unnamable stains on my dress shirts; ketchup, coffee, soy sauce, most from the week before. There was no direct outing but I could see in my portfolio that my performance record went down and I received an HR call asking if I had any dependents, which may or may not have been related but I took it that way. I wasn’t scared of being fired. In a way, I was looking forward to it, high on the idea of having hours to myself, getting to be outside instead of in a grey, plastic purgatory. I told myself that this was what I wanted, a nice hefty severance to start my life over, and then I would get my act together, get a master’s degree, become a black belt. But they never axed me. Instead, I was told at quarterly one on ones that it was clear I was going through something, and that’s alright. I would get a pat on the back and the advice to go for a walk, try a meditation app, write ten good things a day. I wish that was all I needed, to go for a walk. I found myself in a silent shock, absorbing the reactions around me, or the complete dulling lack of them. The way they painted the solutions to these problems, as if it were a matter of blood flow, fruit servings, and not the inescapable wires of society. That a person could sincerely change their world around with sixty minutes of exercise a day and a list of sunrises. And I tried that, I always tried. If there was a remedy I would go for it, anything to take away the awfulness of it, anything to belittle the agony. But nothing worked for me. And there was something hilarious in it too, that they were telling me I was going through something, as if I were not crushingly aware of the awful despair and what it did to me, of the dented shell of a human it left in its tracks. And despite this knowing that I was going through something it bothered me that I was never, not once, asked what it was. There was no one pulling me into the empty conference room to say, I’m worried about you. Did someone pass away? Was there a break-up? Is there something you were diagnosed with? No one cared to ask, no one cared to name what the issue was, to give it presence. And I found I really wanted them to ask. I wanted them to know.* 

 

*It’s strange, the things you want to name.* 

 

*The things you want to say out loud.* 





**Type of feedback:** 

I'm looking for someone to read this manuscript and offer feedback on pacing, intrigue, and tone as well as how successfully it emulates a surrealist book. I have typed up a series of questions I would like you to answer after you finish this book (about 3 pages worth). 



**Content warnings:** 

Depression/suicidal ideation 

Psychological thriller elements 

Hospitalization 

Burning 



**Preferred Timeline:** 

One month would be ideal but I'm flexible if you could finish it by July 15th. 



**Books I liked that have influenced this novel:** I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Ian Reid (or anything Ian Reid), Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn, Wild by Cheryl Strayed, Grey Dog by Elliot Gish 



**Beta swap availability:** 

It would be great to work with a fellow psychological horror novelist! I am also open to literary fiction, philosophy, mysteries & thrillers, and possibly a different genre if you think we would be a great fit!

I’ll always have those intrusive thoughts, I’ll always be the over thinker- I’ll always question intentions. 
I guess I’ve just learned to control it.. maybe mask it? i don’t know.
But as a result  those traumas are unfortunately carried…. Daily…. Everywhere. 
And It’s tiring as fuck… 
I was slash am tired of not trusting people… and not letting my guard down or being able to… for whatever the reason… but i don’t know- things are changing questionmark?¿ - I think.

And that there are people out there who actually fucking listen, and not just to respond, but to genuinely learn about someone or something… people who actually genuinely care- people who genuinely love hard…. Truly Genuine people. 
We’re both the same ethnicity, we both have the same sense of humour, we both realize when we’re struggling through something so we genuinely help each other. We both listen to different types of music, are spontaneous, and adventurous… We like a lot of the same things but at the same time have so many opposing interests. We’ve talked future plans together. He’s hard working. He’s family oriented. He wants babies, and a family. Which I’m back and forth on but it’s only because I don’t wanna be 55 while my child is graduating high school… 
I’ve known this dude for years.. we kinda grew up together… messaged on Facebook since we were kids, and saw each other in passing seldomly. He tried years ago to meet up, and grab a bite- even coffee, he gave me the free reign to choose what we do, I always played hard to get or was busy.. and maybe it’s stupid but now, I feel like I robbed us of all those years. I even said that to him, I freakin apologized for it. Who knows where we’d be… what we’d be… this is all still pretty new, so maybe this post is a jinx… maybe I’ll look back at this one day with him and laugh.. but I am a strong believer in everything happening for a reason.. 
I’ve literally prayed for someone who I can grow and laugh with, learn with, someone who I can read the Bible with, and practice the Word of God with. Someone who sees vulnerability as a strength as opposed to a weakness. Someone who won’t walk away cause I cry a little too much.. someone who’s not so damn judgmental.. someone who’s easy to be around. And maybe I’d like someone who’s easy to look at too. 
This screenshot I chose to share is such a surface level conversation- but it’s the little things for me. He actually waited for my call, and we spoke for a bit- as soon as I could hear him fighting sleep I told him he should get some rest, he proceeds to ask if I can hang up once he’s asleep cause he misses me and it’s like I’m there cause he’s able to hear my voice as he falls asleep… I hate hanging up on this man, but I’d be an ass if I drained his battery and he didn’t have an alarm for work… 
I guess the point of this post is to remind people not to settle, and to continue to work on yourself and soon, that good shit will follow. 
I’ve had highs and lows while being single, but had I not taken that time- that ME time. I wouldn’t be this version of me, and I don’t think I’d be receptive to taking someones unsolicited advice, or I don’t think I’d be able to handle the constructive criticism when needed.. it’s bitter sweet, I feel like I’m the best Ive ever been mentally to pursue a relationship- but I also can’t help but question what if I did accept the advances my way 13 years ago… 


TL;DR It honestly is the little things; and NOW, I get what someone means when they say “if they want too, they will”. Be the best version of you possible, and don’t settle! ",4,1748313737.0,texts,1,0.67,False

1. Do you think this is a growing trend at your cafes and how are consumers receiving it?
2. What do you think are the best use-cases for canning? IMO the convenience is great as its easy to takeaway and I can choose to consume my coffee later (e.g., pop it in the fridge for the day)

1kwcgrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1kwcgrn/ive_been_dating_a_korean_girl_for_over_a_year_and/,I've been dating a korean girl for over a year and I don't think we're getting anywhere,"So for context I'm working overseas in south Korea and have been for almost 2 years now. We've been seeing each other since March last year but not the entire time but I'll get into that later. For privacy sake I won't delve into what her or my lines of work are or our names but we're both in our late 20s. Due to my line of work I'm very well off: rent a nice place to live, make a good wage, drive a nice car, ect. Also not sure how much it matters but we're both Christian but she's more of a actual Christian than me. (e.g she actually goes to church regularly) It is important to know she's the type to be celibate till marriage though which I've known and been ok with the entire time.

The timeline goes that last march we met on Tinder which might pop up as a red flag but here it seems to be the most mainstream dating app and isn't used mostly for hookups like it is in the US. Right out the gate I felt infatuated but I try to be as self aware as possible in my life so I knew even then that's that feeling was but it's never really gone away. We dated for months and in hindsight I think my feelings for her blinded me to the fact that we weren't getting anywhere but August is when we really hit the rocks. She had expressed to me that she didn't want to be pressured into anything so we took a very casual approach to everything while we were dating so I told her she had the steering wheel essentially and we could go at her pace. Things seemed like they were progressing albeit slowly. She started letting me pay for things or help her out with stuff which she didn't like before. Then I had to move out of the town we lived in and to Seoul for work. I rent a house in gangnam now which is basically a hour drive away from that town. That was basically the iceberg that sunk everything for the rest of the year. She expressed that it was too long distance and if I'm honest she had been putting up roadblocks before that like getting annoyed with me alot and spacing our dates further and further apart and even telling me she wanted me to wait to ask her to go official till I lost weight. (I guess I'll add that I'm decently tall but at the time I was pretty husky even for my height) Pretty much as soon as I finished moving in September she broke it off and we basically didn't talk to each other at all. 

During that time I dated a few other people but didn't get into a proper relationship until December when I dated girl who was graduating from her college in seoul. That relationship had the opposite problem where things went too quickly but I'll definitely take the blame on that. By February she had crossed a massive boundary for me that basically ruined any trust we had built at that point so I broke up with her mid February. 

Pretty soon after that happened I reached out to my ex again under the guise of asking for a favor. I had checked in with her on Christmas and new years so we had established we still cared about each other at least as friends even though we weren't dating anymore. It felt great to see her again and enjoy her company while we exchanged favor for a favor. She even apologized for how she had treated me before and right after that we did start dating again but for some reason things were going better than before. We were going on much better dates like going to theme parks and movies as opposed to before we basically just went out to eat and get coffee. She was actually initiating the dates which didn't happen before and at a surprising rate. It got the the point where she asked what days I had off and planned dates on almost all of them. She even asked me to go on a trip with her which she had declined before when offered back when we dated the first time. 

What really cemented the impression that this time was different was when on one of our dates she introduced me to her sibling and after we split off to be on our own she initiated physical contact for the first time. Before this point we had never touched in a intimate way. Never kissed, held hands or anything like that (Weird I know since we dated for 6 months before but remember that gave her control of our pace and she never gave me any hints before so I never tried anything).

Since that date though I feel like we're sliding back down to how we were before. We haven't had any meaningful physical contact since even while we were on the trip together. The dates are still better but now it feels awkward since they're obviously things couples would do but we're basically just going as friends again. She's even been questioning why I treat her the way I do like it's weird for me to be paying for everything and offering to drop her off or pick her up or give her anything. Basically any act of service or gift or attempts to just hold hands she rejects or questions like she used to when we first dated. The other day after spending all day together I said something she took offense to and she gave me the cold shoulder while I drove a hour to take her home. The next morning we cleared it up since it was a miscommunication but it bothers me that she basically assumed I intentionally would say something mean or rude to her unprovoked. It was basically like the first time we dated where she would get annoyed and upset with me over a small slip or miscommunication and not have any patience or give me the benefit of the doubt. 

Because I've dated americanized and local Koreans I know both the relationship and the woman aren't typical or standard but I don't know if I need to give up on it, if I should persevere and keeping going as things are or if I should buckle down and be more forward and lay out my expectations to her. Maybe I should have done something already but tbh I'm terrified I might be  ruining it if I try take the wheel back from her now. I don't think its a cultural difference since I got along fine with other korean women when we were broken up but I'm open to feedback and any advice at all is appreciated.

When you come in, say hi and get settled in (maybe get a coffee or tea since we're doing this at a coffee shop). Start reading your book. If you need to talk about something happening in your book, ask if anyone can pause to listen. Also, if you're in a place in your book that you can pause and listen to someone as they ramble, please do so. Maybe we'll discover new books to read, maybe we'll get entranced in delightful conversation - who knows. At the very least, we'll get some time to dive into our books (:

We can start with a casual coffee date and if we like each other, we can talk about dating more and spending time together with the possibility of so much more. Let me know what kind of dynamic that you wish for, and we can adjust our situation to make it great for both of us. I'm open to short-term, friends, dating, and even maybe eventually long-term. I like outdoor activities such as hiking and bicycling and boating and tennis, and I would love an upbeat fun activities exercise partner. I also like staying at home and cooking dinner or watching a movie together. I would also like to explore new places and events with my girlfriend. I want a close and intimate and trusting bond with a nice girl who really cares about fitness and good health and helping others.

I am into personal touch, as my love language with many hugs, gentle aftercare, kissing, PDAs, holding hands, and cuddling. I hope for intense intimacy and a strong positive emotional connection. I desire quality time together and many fun dates exploring and always getting to know ourselves better.

I was annoyed that she wanted to hold hands too. I’m super confused as to why I was annoyed by it though. Someone must know this feeling.

1kwc9w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kwc9w3/first_date_red_flags_need_opinions/,First date red flags? Need opinions!,"Hi everyone,

I went on a first date recently and I’m wondering if I’m overthinking some things. I’d love to get your thoughts, especially from a guy’s perspective!

⸻

Background:
We (both in our mid to late 30s) matched on a dating app. I initiated the hello and introduced myself. He took a couple of days to reply, after which he explained he was traveling. Since we lived near each other (as per the app), I suggested we meet up. He was busy and proposed Sunday or Monday, so we agreed on Monday.

The Conversation:
Me: “Let’s meet here unless you have another place in mind.”
Him: Suggests a place an hour away for me by train.
Me: “Is this near where you live? I thought we were close by.”
Him: “Yes, it’s near me.”
Me: “I don’t drive, so it’s far for me. How about we meet halfway?”
Him:” ok but you live near the train station so you can manage”
Me: “sorry but I’ll have to change two trains to get there. Let’s meet halfway.”
Him: “Okay.” Suggests a place halfway.

We decided to meet at 4 PM. Around 3 PM, I noticed the cafe he suggested would close at 4 PM due to Memorial Day. I texted him about it, and when he didn’t respond, I called him. He asked me to find another place nearby and text him the options, and that he would respond.

I gave him two options, and he didn’t respond. It was 3:30 pm and time was ticking. I texted him saying, “hey I’ll only leave from my place after you confirm our meeting place.” Finally, around 3:36 pm he said either was fine, so I picked one and headed out. He also confirmed that it would take him 20 mins to get there. I kept him updated on my location while in transit. I arrived at exactly 4 PM, but he wasn’t there. When I called him, he said he was “10 minutes away,” but I could hear his wardrobe door creaking in the background. He was still at home. I decided to leave if he did not show up by 4:30 pm. He eventually arrived around 4:25 PM.

The Date:
When he arrived, he apologized for the delay. I told him he could have just informed me to arrive a little later instead of keeping me waiting. He said “everything happened so fast, I could not update you.” Ok, like, whatever. Anyway, I tried to keep things positive and started a conversation about his coffee order. We chatted, and I asked him like how is it possible that a guy like him is still single ? (Semi flirting). He started talking about his past relationship and I was listening intently. And since he had brought it up., I asked him how long had he been in that relationship for? He became super cagey and wouldn’t give any details, then got defensive about discussing it on a first date—even though he had started the topic. He then asked why I was single and I was answering that question in all honestly and he just cut me off, concluding that it must be because I want someone like my father to take care of me. I found that pretty off-putting and told him that taking care of your partner is a basic expectation in any relationship. He doubled down on his theory, which made me even more uncomfortable.

When I asked about his job, he was vague and evasive, just saying he worked for a bank. When I pressed, he mumbled something about a “Swiss bank,” which felt weird and defensive.

The Walk:
After finishing our coffee, I suggested we take a walk. He said but there’s no good place to walk around here. So I asked him where his car was parked and he replied it was a few blocks away. I said ok let me walk you to your car. To which he responded “and then you’ll walk back to the station?”. He didn’t offer me a ride to the station (which would have taken a few mins by car) even though I walked him all the way to it. As we arrived closer to the place he parked his car, he said, let’s keep walking straight ahead. And then we circled back. While on the walk, he very directly checked me out (scanning my body up and down with his eyes and wasn’t even subtle about it) and started laughing. I was like what’s funny ? And he said “no I was just checking how fit you are.” (I was kinda shocked but played along) and said uh huh ? And did you think I’m fit? He said “I can’t tell, maybe it’s the dress you’re wearing which is making it difficult to tell.” At this point, he almost walked into oncoming traffic and then jokingly blamed me for not pulling him back, which felt really odd.

Finally, as we were approaching his car again, he said no let’s walk to the station and mansplained which direction my train would be, even though I clearly didn’t need the help.",1,1748312817.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

I think we could be great friends if we give it a go.",1,1748312808.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

His EF in August was 20-25 and Dr wanted him to have an ICD implanted He had the Medtronic Cobalt ICD implanted in December. All was well since then. EF has improved dramatically to 50-55.  

He had an ablation in January for afib. It didn't last and was put on Tikosyn in February.  Everything has been good since.  On Saturday morning he woke up about 6:15AM. Got himself a cup of coffee and sat down with his laptop. He started to feel lightheaded and short of breath. All of a sudden BAM.  His first thought was that he was shot. He's never been shot but that is where his mind went in that split second. He actually looked up expecting to see someone with a gun!  When nobody was there, he realized what happened.

They tell you if it happens once and you feel ok, you do not have to go to the ER. I said nope, we're going.  They ran every test in the book. Two different echo's, labs, chest xray and more labs.  Everything was fine.  They were going to admit him for a stress test but after contacting his EP they discharged him.  EP thinks it was atrial flutter and wants to discuss another ablation.  

He's supposed to schedule an appt tomorrow to see the EP....these things always happen on a holiday weekend...and have no idea what questions we should be asking.  Would this be considered an inappropriate fire? From what I understand, the device should be able to distinguish between a atrial flutter and a life threatening arrhythmia.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1748312787.0,PacemakerICD,0,1.0,False

# About me:

* Deep into wellness, personal growth, nature, and meaningful community.
* I love clean eating, cold plunges, beach sunsets, hikes, and good coffee.
* Looking to meet grounded, conscious people — maybe even my future partner.
* Budget: $4,500–$5,000/month.
* Work from home but would like to have near by cafe/coworking spaces.

# What I’m looking for in a neighborhood:

* Close to the beach or great hiking trails.
* Walkable/bikeable to cafes, healthy food spots, farmers markets, and a gym or recovery studio.
* A chill, welcoming vibe — somewhere soulful but not too sleepy.

Encinitas is high on my list, but I’m open to other ideas if they match the energy.

If you live in San Diego (or know the area well), where do you think someone like me should land?

Any tips, recommendations would mean a lot.

I’m a science student so I live a very sedentary life style, but after moving out I have full control of my diet and have lost weight without working out. 

I’ve plateaued for the past 5 months, and I feel like my diet has way too much sugar so I’m looking for substitute suggestions. I don’t work out, but I walk a lot, and I would love to start working out but I’m very busy with school and it’s hard to find the time to start a routine. 

So far this is my diet: 

Breakfast: Oatmeal and a black coffee 

Snacks/ Lunch throughout the day: 2 pieces of fruit, muesli bar, snack pack of trail mix, snack pack of popcorn

Dinner: changes every week, but I prioritise vegetables and protein. Change portion sizes depending on how hungry I am at the end of the day.

Water: try for 1L per day 

Sometimes I’ll add in some crackers and cheese if I’m extra hungry. And sometimes I’ll buy a regular chai latte. 

My biggest issue is my snacks/lunch. I’m at school studying, and don’t like cold leftovers so I usually just bring snacks but with the fruit and snack packs, I feel like I’m filling up with sugar. What can I bring instead? 

I’d love to lose another 10kgs by the end of the year!

I’m 27 weeks and currently on 26 units for breakfast, 15 units for lunch and dinner, and 22 units for bedtime along with 1500 mg metformin every morning. I’m having a hard time with breakfast especially, fasting always high unless I eat my full dinner closer to 9pm and wake up at 6am. I’m at a point where I can’t eat without insulin and I’m so tired if injecting myself and the bruises. Today I had a Caesar salad and a yasso bar thinking I wouldn’t need insulin as it really wasn’t even a full meal and it still spiked me above 140. The dr keeps increasing it frequently when it’s not working. I’ve been struggling this entire month with my numbers. April was so good, found meals and dosing that worked for me but then life got stressful beginning of May and numbers got high and im still struggling to manage numbers on a daily basis. When I went to my OB appt last week she seemed shocked that my insulin had increased from when I last saw her at the beginning of the month and it made me self conscious. Like are these high amounts for someone at my point in pregnancy or something? My endocrin just keeps telling me that as the pregnancy goes on it gets harder to manage and we just have to keep upping the dose while making sure I’m eating 15 carbs + protein at bedtime and 30-45 g carbs for all meals as well as eating every 2-3 hours. Diabetes is soooo discouraging and defeating. My baby is already over 2lbs 5oz as of 26 weeks and the OB already told me he’s “big already” and we need to “monitor closely” and I’m just beating myself up that this is all my fault and I suck truly at controlling my diet. I’ve also noticed my blood sugar rises significantly if I exercise even though drs insist to go for short walks after meals to help the number, that doesn’t work for me.

I tried using flatmax but its nowhere close to clarity of notes i get with c40. I tried diff grind settings/rpm, but nothing matches c40.

Ideally i would like to learn how to use flatmax for pourover but if thats not possible,  what other grinder i can use to get c40 like profile?

At the beginning, she was super excited, elated I would say. She was super hyper all the time I began to think she was manic.

She used my toothpaste, curling iron etc and eating my food. But we got along great I thought a friendship was forming. We laughed at everything, she confided in me, we gave each other advice.

But the last few weeks have been off. She’s been cold and I haven’t been able to figure out why. I put it down to her adjusting and maybe stress, internal struggles, mental health. She stopped telling me stuff, she stopped laughing so much. And is in her room or outside constantly.

She told me today that she doesn’t want me texting her so much, only if it’s needed because she’s not a texter more of a talker.

Keep in mind I’ve only texted her here and there to say things like “I made coffee for the morning” or “picking up bagels what kind do you want?”.

And goes onto say she is adjusting to the change of having a roommate and she needs more personal space. She doesn’t like the fact that the living room is just outside her bedroom and feels she would like me to be in my room while she’s in her room.

She says that she likes that we talk and cook together but for her that’s good. She is having a really hard time with privacy. For context, her bedroom has its own front door so she can come and go as she pleases and the apartment is a ground floor of a house very spacious!

Suffice to say, this was after the other day when she insisted I confirm to her dishwasher routine of only using the dishwasher no handwashing because the rack is in the way of the corner sink. If I want to hand wash dishes I need to take out the huge rack from under the sink now.

All in all, I feel extremely love bombed in a weird way. She’s seemed like this social butterfly getting drunk most nights and now she is barely around me. If this is what it’s like I dont want it.

I’m a coffee-loving creative on the east coast of Florida who values depth, humor, and emotional honesty. Faith is a daily part of my life, not just Sundays, but something that grounds me and helps shape how I treat people and myself. 

I’m in a season of growth spiritually, emotionally, and creatively. I share my home with people I love and a few lovable pets. I have two small tattoos (if that’s a dealbreaker, I understand), and I’m always seeking to become more grounded, healed, and whole. Growth, in every sense, is part of my rhythm. I care deeply about emotional depth, discernment, and gentleness paired with strength. Accountability and self-awareness matter to me, as does a steady pursuit of peace, purpose, and alignment with God. You should know that I’m waiting for marriage before having s3x. 

Family is incredibly important to me, and while I live in a close-knit home now, I hope to start my own someday. I’ve been through enough to know what I don’t want, but I haven’t let that make me hard.

Vulnerable? Yes. Bitter? No. Healing and hopeful? Absolutely💕

I’m looking for a man who leads with humility, lives with integrity, and loves with intention. Someone emotionally safe, spiritually grounded, and secure in who he is. Not intimidated by a strong woman, but excited to have one build beside him. If you’re someone who talks to God more than you talk about Him, who values growth, family, and laughter, I’d genuinely love to connect and see where a meaningful conversation could lead. Looking for something real. I don’t mean perfect. I just mean intentional. Also it matters to me that you also value waiting for marriage for yourself, not just on my behalf. 

Oh, and I’m curvy and active. I like weight lifting and going for morning walks. Also I’m divorced and have been for 3yrs. He was the only man I was ever with. It was a biblical divorce and I haven’t dated or been with anyone else… I’ve taken that time to heal.

I lost it.

I yelled something like, “Are you kidding me? This is a war crime!” She laughed, but honestly, I was pissed.

I spent the next two hours cleaning up sparkles that kept appearing out of nowhere for days after. Mr. Whiskers gave me the stink eye for days too.

I told her this was NOT okay, and if she pulls anything like that again, she’s sleeping on the couch.

She said I was overreacting, that it was just glitter, and I needed to lighten up.

So far I'm back to - and a bit past - where I left off last summer before the usual winter form drift. My drives look good and don't rise and stall late in the flight, robbing distance.  

Its been repeatable between rounds, which is amaIng for any form change. And even helped some timing/brace things fall into place.  I actually feel a pivot around a center point for the first time.

I'm pretty stoked, because all this pour the coffee and turn the key stuff wasn't doing it for me.

Do you do this already?     
Have you tried it?

Last week, I got the indicator that I need to descale the machine so I purchased the official kit from Nespresso and performed it. 

  
It worked fine for the couple of days following the descaling, but this morning, when I attempted to make a coffee using the milk option button, the machine flashes all the lights (including the descaling and clean indicator) and then just powers down. I thought maybe that it was due to the descaling process not being performed correctly the first time, so I did it again and still no change. 

I am able to make a coffee if I select the Espresso or Lungo option, but the LED's simply flash when I attempt to use the third option which includes milk. 

Any advice other than taking the machine in? ",1,1748312058.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Our conversations were mostly one-sided. We planned to meet at a park, but she canceled, saying she hurt her leg.

She told me her ex abandoned her and that she had been seeing someone else but was replaced. When I got mugged and almost lost her number, she didn’t seem to care and said she wouldn't message me unless I messaged first.

She often talked about her cats and got really upset once when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex. Later, I invited her to the movies since she complained we never went out. She first said no because she was embarrassed, then agreed, but the next day she said, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?”

We went anyway, kissed during the movie, spent the afternoon together, but she stayed emotionally distant. She wouldn’t let me see her phone or give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Later, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. She didn’t want the lights on and quickly became moody. We went to a park afterward and I walked her home—but it felt like she didn’t want me anywhere near her family.

Another time, her sister dropped her off at my place, and I jokingly said we didn’t go out much because she was being difficult. She got really mad. While gaming, I criticized a game, and she stopped playing. Then she brought me chocolate, we made out—and while at my house another day, she suddenly said, “Wouldn’t it be better if we separated?” (not exactly a breakup, just vague).

She invited me to a party, changed her mind several times, and told me to arrive exactly at 6pm. I showed up early, her sister saw me and let me in. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend—then made a random joke like, “Let’s download a dating app to find you a hot girl.”

That night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I left. After everything, I called her and officially ended things. She cried, blocked me, then messaged me later saying I “sent her to therapy,” “took her happiness,” but also that she missed me more than she expected.

We started talking again, but I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was helping a friend. I told her I loved her. She said she had gone somewhere and wished I was there. Then she invited me to her mom’s birthday—I didn’t go.

Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me for coffee. We spoke again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I ended up venting about everything online, and she found it. She said I manipulated and used her, blamed me for everything, and then blocked me for good.

28M | Telugu | Designer | Looking for a Serious Connection
Whome to get married with 


I turned 28 this month and figured it's finally time to open my heart to someone. I’ve spent most of my life in my own imaginative world—designing, dreaming, overthinking, you name it. Never been in a relationship, real or imaginary (yes, that rare breed), simply because I wasn’t ready. But now? I am.

**A little about me**:
I’m a designer with 6+ years of experience, and for the past 2 years, I’ve been working independently—chasing peace of mind and my passion. I’m a simple Telugu guy who finds joy in good food, great conversations, slow mornings, and soulful sunsets. Filter coffee is my fuel, and spontaneous travel is my therapy.

**My vibe**:
I love exploring places—especially underrated gems—and prefer staying with locals, soaking in new cultures. (Lived in Uttarakhand for two months just to experience that.) I talk to 3-year-olds and 80-year-youngs with the same curiosity. I cook, click pictures, and recently got serious about fitness too—so would love a partner with similar health goals.

**What I’m looking for**:
Someone who's emotionally available, open to sharing a life of adventure, stillness, chaos, and connection. If you’re someone who values meaningful moments, long conversations, local street food, weekend getaways, and dreamy sunrises—I think we’ll get along just fine.

I’m an extrovert with a sensitive core. Life with me might feel like a 4D movie—complete with drama, laughter, detours, and warm hugs. Just looking for a co-star now.

If this resonates, let’s talk. And if not, thanks for reading and wish me luck!

Love,
28M

1kwbvoq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwbvoq,[OC] Breakfast Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches - Budget Savings at $.78ea!,"I decided to do some meal prep for the week while I had an extra day off! Made some delicious Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches... An inspired take from my love of the McMuffin!

I have tried the Jimmy Deans or store brand sandwiches, but they are just so packed with sodium and other ingredients we can barely pronounce, along with the prices! So I wanted to make some with a cut down of the sodium and artificial flavors to have on hand in the freezer when the craving hit. It also saves you money from stopping at the drive through or the fancy coffee shops in the morning that only charge an arm and a leg.

The original recipe posted is for 6 I doubled the recipe for 12 sandwiches; budget below is for 12. 

***Budget Breakdown for Texas area:***

1 dozen eggs $2.50

2x-6 pack of English Muffins $1.59 = $3.18

8oz bag of shredded cheese $2.79

10 pack frozen sausage links $.99

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Total: $9.46 for 12 Sandwiches = $.78ea



# Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches 

**Servings** – 6

**Prep Time** – 10 Minutes

**Chill Time:** 15 Minutes

**Cook Time** – 15-20 Minutes

# Ingredients:

* 6 English muffins, *store bought or homemade*
* 6 eggs
* 2 Tablespoons milk or water
* Salt and pepper, *to taste*
* 10 sausage links, *chopped into chunks*
* 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

# Directions:

Heat oven to 350 degrees & spray your mold pan with non stick cooking spray; set aside.

Sautee, grill or microwave sausage links according to package. Chop into chunks. *I personally cut mine in half lengthwise then into fourth chunks.*

In a small bowl crack your 6 eggs, add milk and season with salt and pepper. Whisk until completely combined, light and fluffy.

Pour egg mixture splitting it evenly into the 6 pre-sprayed pan molds.

Add in chunks is sausage and the sprinkle shredded cheese spreading it amongst the 6 eggs.

Place in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. Just until the eggs are darken yellow and slightly golden. *They will continue to cook once you remove them from the oven.*

Let sit in the pan for 15 minutes if you are not serving immediately. See note below.

# Notes:

**For freezer prep:**

Slice open each English muffin. Top each muffin with an egg and close with top half. Wrap each sandwich individually in wax paper. Place in gallon storage bag. Set in freezer once cooled.

**Serving immediately:**

Toast the English muffins, and then butter them to your liking. Add a warm eggs and place on the top of toasted English muffin, close with top half.

These homemade egg McMuffins are delicious just as they are, but feel free to add some ketchup or hot sauce if you like.

If you need a little caffeine to start the morning, these breakfast sandwiches go great with a homemade vanilla sweet cream cold brew iced coffee. You’ll love this combination and the pocket savings!",6,1748311597.0,budgetcooking,0,1.0,False

Itinerary:

4/18 Overnight flight to Heathrow

4/19 Flight to Venice

4/19-4/22 Venice

4/22 Overnight train to Vienna

4/23-4/26 Vienna

4/26-4/28 Salzburg

4/28 Munich

4/29 Fly to NY

4/30 Fly home

**The flight:** The 90-year-olds flew business class where they could fully recline, and they arrived in relatively good shape. We took advantage of the wheelchair service at every airport.

**Practicalities**

After the flights, we had the balancing of people, walkers, and luggage down to an art.

Overall, we did our sightseeing in the morning and a bit after lunch. By 2--4, the seniors were ready to relax in the hotel. I think we went out to dinner once, but otherwise we enjoyed lunches out. We stopped to rest when they needed it, and we changed plans whenever it made sense. For example, we were heading to a well-reviewed Italian restaurant in Salzburg when the wind picked up, which was hard on mom. We quickly pivoted to the closest Italian restaurant and had a perfectly mediocre meal but warm, happier travelers.

We took the subway to the first airport, taxis (and one bus) to and from airports and train stations, and taxis to some sights that were more than a 10-minute or so walk.

**Luggage**: The seniors each brought a walker and packed a rolling carryon. My sister and I packed backpacks, so we had one hand free to roll a bag and one arm free to lean on.

**Venice (3 nights)**: Our connecting flight from Heathrow was canceled, so we arrived in Venice late at night. We took the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma, then the vaporetto to San Marco Vallaresso and walked from there. Nighttime on the Grand Canal was magical, and we enjoyed peeking into palazzos. Also incredible walking across an empty San Marco and seeing and hearing the clock strike the hour. 

This was our first vaporetto! One of us took the suitcases onto the boat then reached up for a walker and put it down while the other one helped one senior onto the boat, then we repeated. We led them carefully to seats reserved for people who need them. We found everyone incredibly solicitous and were always able to secure a seat for the seniors. (One Italian woman sat with her teenage daughter in the handicapped seats and didn’t move when we approached, but she was the only one the whole trip, and then her own husband chastised her.) The people working on the vaporetto were super helpful and patient---we were always helped and never rushed. Dealing with the walkers on the crowded boat was a bit of a hassle, but we always worked it out. Once I stood on the deck with the folded walkers while the others sat.

We stayed at the Hotel Firenze, which had an elevator, though it still required a few steps. They couldn’t have been nicer accommodating folded walkers in the very tight reception space. The most worrisome thing was the quite large step up to the bathroom in our room, which I myself tripped over. I was concerned that my mom or aunt would forget it was there in the middle of the night, so we left the bathroom light on and the door slightly ajar to remind everyone about the step. I also insisted they wake me up if they needed to use the bathroom, but after the first night, we were all used to it. They even made it up the spiral staircase to the rooftop terrace to enjoy the sunset. (We spotted them, of course.)

Two family members recently transplanted to Spain joined us in Venice, so we had four able-bodied adults, which made everything easier. We navigated bridges when we needed to, going up steps slowly or using the ramps, but avoided them as much as possible. We were very lucky with the weather---it was occasionally almost too warm!

We visited Murano, which my mom was eager to share with her sister. The difference visiting with the older folks was that instead of looking for the “best” experience, we prioritized what was closest. That glass demonstration right next to the vaporetto stop? Yep, that was us. It took a bit of a mental shift for us who were accompanying, but we constantly helped each other make it.

The hotel was quite close to St. Marks, so we easily walked there. Mom and aunt enjoyed Easter service at the cathedral. We also took a tour of the Jewish ghetto, though we dropped out after the first synagogue. I’d told the guide at the beginning that we’d do as much as we could. We just really needed to be flexible. They seemed to enjoy the DaVinci museum and were even game to go up and down the 25+ stairs.

**Overnight train to Vienna:** This was hysterical. We got a four-bed couchette and settled the seniors on the bottom bunks, then spent the night rocking not particularly gently and not sleeping much. We accompanied them to the restroom because of the rocking of the train, but the rails along the corridor were helpful handholds. Also, the conductor told us we should’ve given notice that we were bringing the walkers, but they still found a spot to store them. 

I’d had the hotel in Venice print out our reservations. After settling mom and aunt, my sister and I went to the dining car to see what we could scrounge. (We should have packed lots of tasty food for this---our embarkation was rushed.) I had told the seniors: “If the conductor comes and says something, here are the tickets, just point to them and say ‘tickets,’” and set them on the top bunk by the door. When we came back, the printout was gone. Later they said that was a good call: they’d done just that and it worked. 

**Vienna (3 nights):**

Mom runs cold, and that came to a head in Vienna, where we moved from the relative warmth of Venice to gray skies and drizzle. Looking back, I wish I’d bought a warm hat without consulting her and just given her a hat---she would have been more comfortable, and we would have had to do less fussing with scarves and layers.

I wasn’t prepared for the amount of smoking in Vienna, and it detracted from my trip, because most of the venues where we ate outdoors were crowded, and I ended up with my hair smelling like an ashtray and my throat clogged up.

After the overnight train, the seniors decided to stay in and rest at the hotel (Radisson Blu Herrengasse, perfect location, highly recommend) for the day. We’d stayed together in one room in Venice, but in Vienna the seniors had their own room (no steps!). We went to the Billa grocery store, which had a great ready-made section (think Whole Foods), and got them some asparagus soup, bread, and salad before heading out. They had their phones if they needed us.

My sister’s two adult boys joined us in Vienna, so the four of us went out and walked around, had schnitzel at Figlmüller (Bäckerstrasse), gelato at the Cafe de l’Europe, and just window shopped. I love the area around Bäckerstrasse for cafes and restaurants, especially the narrow lanes that cut between the streets.

The next day we planned to walk to the cathedral and grab lunch from the wurst stand (Zum goldenen Würstel I, Spiegelgasse just off Graben). It started to drizzle, though, so we pulled up at Cafe Demel instead. There was a line, so the seniors did some souvenir shopping inside a nearby shop while a couple of us waited. This was one of those times when their walkers were handy for sitting. 

Before our tables were ready, I walked them inside (without walkers) to see (and smell!) the Kaiserschmarrn (dessert pancakes) being made at the back in giant cast iron pans and the intricate gingerbread Stephansdom. We left the walkers just outside (and unfortunately got seated outside, too). We shared a few sweets with coffee and loved it.

When the sky cleared up, we went on to the cathedral, where a Freedom Party (far right) mayoral candidate was speaking on an outdoor stage. Intense. We visited the cathedral on our own for about 20 minutes, then wandered back to the hotel to rest. 

Right outside our hotel, in addition to the horse-drawn carriages, I’d seen several antique cars with three rows of seats and thought that would be a great way to see the city, so I called and arranged a tour for the six of us. Our driver was born-and-bred Viennese, knowledgeable and very proud of his city, and he did his best to speak English so everyone could understand. The car was open on the sides but had plastic walls that could be brought down to keep the wind out. He also had thick blankets, which we very much appreciated. I think it was a 60-minute tour, and we got to see the highlights. It was a hit! The company is called E-Oldtimer Panoramafahrt if you’re interested. 

We walked to dinner at the Kaffee Alt Wien, one of my favorites for its artsy vibe and classic Viennese flair. We made a couple of stops on the way to look at shops and take it easy. I’d reserved a table since we were 6 and just in case, and it was perfect. They had room for the walkers in the back where people stash strollers, so that all worked out too. I think this was the only dinner the seniors went out to on the trip, and they enjoyed it.

The next morning my sister and I went across the street to the Cafe Central, a historic cafe that now has a constant line. We went early and just walked in, and I was happy to see the bamboo newspaper rack is still there and very much in use. We had lovely coffee and a sweet, but for me, really these places are themselves the reason to go.

Our big plan for the day was one of the main reasons for the trip: seeing the Vienna Boys Choir, which has been on my mom’s bucket list forever. I bought these tickets months in advance. The show wasn’t until the late afternoon, and since it was drizzly, the seniors elected to stay in. We set them up in the hotel’s bar/restaurant with a deck of cards and left them to it. My sister, the boys, and I headed to another favorite cafe, Hawelka, for coffee. One of the boys had brought a board game, and we played long enough to need lunch. I think we had more gelato after that. Travel rule: Never say no to gelato.

In the afternoon, we took a cab to the concert. They decided not to bring their walkers, since we were only going to our seats and then back. There was a bit of a hassle with the tickets, as I had the email but hadn’t printed it out. I had to email it to the person at the counter, who then gave us our tickets. Since my mom runs cold, she wanted to keep her coat, but we were told quite firmly that this is not allowed. I was surprised how adamant they were about that. The concert itself was enjoyable---not really my cup of tea, but the singers are impressive.

After the show it took a while to find a cab, but we finally did. I really should’ve downloaded an app! The seniors were done for the day, so the other four of us went to have dinner at Heindl's Schmarren & Palatschinkenkuchl, oh my gosh, so much food and so good! The next day we were going to Salzburg.

**Salzburg (2 nights):**

We had bought train tickets and reserved seats in Vienna for the train from Vienna to Salzburg. I didn’t know if it would be crowded, but I figured the peace of mind is worth the nominal fee. This was the first train we’d taken that went on after we got off, which meant we had limited time to get everyone and everything off the train. As we approached Salzburg, my sister and I moved all our luggage and the walkers to the area by the door. We let other people get off before us, then moved all our stuff onto the platform. Some people waiting to get on the train were impatient, but another passenger explained about the seniors, and then everyone was very kind. We escorted them off the train last. Those big steps are challenging, and we always took the time to navigate them very, very carefully. 

From the train station we grabbed a taxi that took us straight to the plaza outside of the hotel (Hotel Goldgasse, amazing). The hotel was adorable and in a very old building. We figured out how many could fit on the elevator (two with bags or four without), and our rooms were on the same floor. The lovely proprietor had kindly selected the room closest to the elevator for the seniors, so there were no stairs to deal with.

We all headed out to explore and ran smack into a celebration in honor of local volunteer firefighters, with a brass band in Lederhosen and Dirndl (and beer at their feet, which was pretty funny). Fun start! We walked to the Getreidegasse and did some souvenir shopping and sightseeing. The ladies said they wanted Italian for dinner, so I found a good restaurant a 10-minute walk away that I was excited to try. As we walked, though, the wind picked up, and my mom was uncomfortably chilly. Luckily there was a perfectly adequate Italian place right there, so that’s where we went. We really tried to embrace being flexible.

We hadn’t originally planned to visit Salzburg. We thought we’d minimize tiring travel by sticking to Venice and Vienna, but both sisters had their hearts set on a Sound of Music tour, which is what we did the next day after a beautiful breakfast at the hotel. The tour was four hours, and yes, we sang the entire soundtrack. The bus stopped at several locations, a couple of which required a good walk. We didn’t realize that and left the walkers behind. I don’t know that they would’ve had room for them on the bus, but I wish I had known to ask.

At the first stop, we all got off to walk to a location, but mom stopped halfway and went back. (I took a lot of pictures for her.) We stopped for lunch at the town with the church where they got married in the movie, but that also required walking for a while. Instead we went to the gas station cafe right by the parking lot, where we had a reasonable snack. I did walk to the church and took lots of pics for the seniors.

Even though they couldn’t walk everywhere on the tour stops, the bus tour was a really good pick. We got to see some countryside as well as Salzburg, and they enjoyed it tremendously. I reserved tickets online when we were in Vienna, I think, because missing the Lippizaners was such a disappointment, and I didn’t want to risk that again!

The tour ended at the lovely Mirabellgarten, where several scenes were shot. We walked around to a few of them and got a video of the seniors singing. Afterward, I suggested that before we went back to the hotel, we should take the funicular (Festungsbahn) up the mountain to enjoy the views and some coffee. We took a cab to it and enjoyed the ride up. We got a table right at the railing overlooking the valley, which was stunning. It was breezy and mom was chilly, but it was so beautiful and fun that she enjoyed it. I’m really glad we did that---it turned out to be one of my favorite times with them.

We walked back to the hotel and got the seniors settled, then my sister and I set out on a walk. I was intent on visiting Cafe Bazar, an old favorite, so we headed there. Afterward we walked to the train station to get tickets to Munich for the next day, then back to the Stern Biergarten for drinks and dinner and a bit more time enjoying the city. It really is lovely (and very small).

**Munich (1 night):** We only went to Munich because our flight left so early in the morning that it would’ve been challenging to get to the airport on time otherwise. At the Munich train station, the walk from our train to the taxi was extremely long, and the ladies needed a restroom. I couldn’t find one that didn’t require stairs, and as we had all our luggage, that was difficult. 

I finally saw a waiting area for people who use wheelchairs. I asked an official-looking woman who happened to be there about a stair-free restroom, as an older lady needed one, and she took us to the train station mission (Bahnhofsmission). Shout out to the Bahnhofsmission folks who take care of anyone who needs help, including people with mobility issues.

The area outside the train station is under construction, so the usual taxi waiting areas weren’t there. I left the others and went to flag one down. I got lucky and didn’t have to go more than half a block or so to find a minivan taxi that could accommodate all of us, our luggage, and the walkers.

We took the taxi from the train station to our hotel (Schlicker zum goldenen Lӧwen), then quickly left for lunch. We knew that if we stayed in the room too long, we probably wouldn’t leave. We walked to the Viktualienmarkt (the reason I chose the hotel, highly recommend) for lunch then to Marienplatz for gelato, then we rode one route on the hop-on-hop-off bus (which stopped right across from our hotel) to get a quick glimpse of the city. When we got back, the ladies did a bit of shopping then retired to pack and relax.

The next day we took a cab to the airport. There was a taxi stand right outside our hotel, and a minivan was there---perfect for all our stuff and walkers.

**Takeaways for next time**:

Taxis aren’t as easy to hail on the street as they are in New York. Even regular taxis, not rideshares, arrived largely for people who had called them. I wish I’d noted their numbers/apps and used them instead of trying to flag them down. 

I wish I’d purchased some tickets ahead of time. We got to do almost everything we wanted, but trains were more expensive, and Lippizanner performance tickets were unavailable.

Cafe sitting was great! One drizzly afternoon my sister, her sons (joined us in Vienna), and I sat in a cafe and played a board game. We should have brought more games to facilitate that with the seniors as well.

It made sense to fly out of Munich since our last stop was Salzburg, but we could've made it to the airport in the morning, though it would've been early. I wish we'd stayed in Salzburg until the morning of our departure. We didn't see much of Munich (no one was particularly interested), and we could've had a more relaxed day in Salzburg instead.

While we had concerns about the seniors’ stamina, when they were motivated they could walk longish distances. Having walkers with seats made things like enjoying gelato easier---they could sit down anytime.

I knew that the seniors were pretty passive (“whatever you feel like doing is fine”), and I wish I’d planned more proactively and definitively: “We’re doing x.”

We should have been more forceful with on and off trains in Vienna and Munich---the Germanic “move along now” speed made transferring luggage and people challenging. When we explained to people what was happening (I speak German and my sister can get by in Italian), though, we received thoughtful well wishes from people. Tourists and locals alike helped us carry walkers and luggage up steps when we had a senior on our arms.

**What we did right** 

\-Identified bathrooms everywhere and took advantage of them frequently. 

\-Made sure everyone ate regular meals, even when our schedules were less regular. 

\-Checked in with our seniors and reiterated that we were there to facilitate their trip ONLY. 

\-Limited the choices we presented to reduce decision fatigue.

\-Told all the hotels that our party included two 90-year-olds. They were thoughtful in their room selection and ready and willing to help with walkers. 

\-Embraced flexibility!

If you’ve read this far, you must certainly be planning your own trip with 90-year-old twins. I wish you all the best! This was the trip of a lifetime, and I’m so grateful that we did it. The ladies kept thanking us, but we got at least as much out of the trip as they did, if not more. Happy travels!

1kwbsga,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwbsga,"1200 miles in 4 days, LA to Golden Gate Bridge and back via PCH","Day one:
Left LA area and got on PCH via Malibu canyon. Rode north with a stop in Solvang for lunch. Saw some amazing views with the coast on our left and mountains to our right. Planned on camping on Plasket Ridge Rd near Big Sur but my buddy on the rebel couldn't make it up the dirt. Swung around into the adjacent campsite and an excellent older English gentleman named William working the campsite gave us their last spot. Turned out he was a former constable and rode enduros as part of his task force with the English police. The guy was amazed by my bike, I guess he'd never seen anything quite like it. The guy showed us a scrapbook full of pictures of him riding R80 BMWs and Suzuki 350s. We shared some of our beer with him and he shared some of his stories with us. Great dude.

Day two:
Woke up early so I could ride by myself up Plasket Ridge. Had to be the most beautiful trail I've ever ridden that I'd consider KLR friendly. Excellent views of the ocean and cliffs + lots of tall trees. Came back down and packed up camp, on the way out William swung by to say his farewells and gave us a tip that if we were headed north we should take Nacimiento-Ferguson road. We took his advice and boy was I glad we did. That was by far the most scenic and beautiful road I've ever ridden. Rode up above the marine layer until we were above the clouds, dropped back down the other side of the mountains and found a nice creek for us to take a quick bath in. Feeling refreshed we pushed onwards until we found ourselves in thick wildfire smoke. Turned out it was a ""prescribed"" fire, basically forestry service clearing out the brush before it gets too thick. Buddy got some wicked shots of me on the KLR riding past it. Made our way through SF and got our photo op at the opposite end of the Golden Gate. We had planned to camp in BLM land south of Davenport on the coast but we got there super late and couldn't find anything that would work. After scouting the coast in the dark for a place to stealth camp we eventually threw in the towel and pushed on to Santa Cruz to a Denny's to fill our bellies with coffee and hot carbs. At about 10:30pm we decided we should push on to our next stop riding through the night when we met yet another nice man named William, a fellow long distance ADV rider who suggested we camp at Laguna Seca raceway. We took his advice and were luckily able to get a spot at Laguna Seca. Set up camp and got to bed around 12.

Day three:
Woke up in Laguna Seca to the sounds of racecars, 10/10 wake up call. Took a hot shower and packed up camp so we could go spectate for a bit. Rode to the paddock, got a sticker for my top box and hiked up to the corkscrew. Watching the racecars hit that section of track was something else. Started making our way south and made a stop in Soledad to gas up, grab lunch, and tighten the chain on my buddies GS (I told him at least twice to adjust it before we left but the dingleberry never listens to me). Asked a tow truck driver at the gas station for a lunch recommendation and he told us about a taqueria tucked inside a grocery store. While waiting in line we made friends with some locals and enjoyed our lunch. Made our way to the AutoZone and found out they didn't have any loaner sockets/breaker bars. The AutoZone employees were super kind and let us borrow the tools they had for sale free of charge and sent us on our way. Every interaction we had in that town was super pleasant and the people were incredibly kind. We made our way south to our next stop, Carizo Plain. The park was absolutely empty which was very nice in it's own way. Rode three up on the long straits. Stopped off at Soda Lake to take some pictures and get some million year old lakebed bicarbonate muck in our boots. Found a nice spot to camp tucked up in the mountains and enjoyed our last night of warm shaken up beer and freedom from cell phone service.

Day four:
Packed up camp and made our way back south. Made a quick stop in Maricopa for gas and lunch where we saw a guy in a GT350 with racing numbers on the windows in painters tape. Asked him where he was racing and turned out he was one of the guys we watched the day before at Laguna Seca! Got some hot food from the gas station Bodega and while we were eating a 62 year old man on an RS1250 pulled up and we had a nice conversation. Told him about our journey and his eyes lit up when I mentioned Nacimiento-Ferguson road. According to him after extensive touring of the Western US that was his favorite road. Didn't catch his name but I assume it was William. We said our farewells and headed out towards the 5 freeway. Had a relatively uneventful ride home going up the Grapevine and past Frazier park. Got home and immediately face planted in my bed. Had to write this all out while it was still fresh on my mind.

The KLR was the best companion for this experience I could possibly ask for. All-in-all this was the trip of a lifetime. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and I wish you many safe and happy miles on whatever you're riding, wherever the road takes you. Cheers 🍻",18,1748311319.0,klr650,2,1.0,False
1kwbseg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwbseg,AIO? Friend group didn’t invite me to BBQ/campout,"I have a group of 12 friends that’ve become really close. We do Friendsgiving, Christmas dinners, camping trips, wine tasting trips, trivia nights — you name it.

I love bringing people together and hosted a lot of the events that introduced them to each other, and the group and friendships took off from there. It turns out, they have a lot more in common with each other than they do with me. I mention the hosting not to say I’m entitled to special treatment, but it is a group I care a lot about and put a lot of effort into cultivating. I went on medical leave last year because I was suicidal, they all know about how my depression stems from loneliness. They were all huge supports for me at the time.

Over the past year, their friendships with each other have blossomed, which truly makes me happy, but I started to notice that they would hang out and make plans without inviting me.

I withdrew slightly because I was feeling excluded, on top of health issues that make it pretty common for me to have to pass on social things. I also just suck at responding to texts (I really am trying 😭).

I was extra hurt by the exchange last night because her reasoning (I didn’t know if your family was still in town), doesn’t ring true. I posted an instagram story late in the afternoon the day before, which is when she would have learned my family was visiting. But I know this group, and they don’t start planning a full BBQ and campout the day before, so I think she had been texting and coordinating with them well beforehand. She had mentioned it to the whole group twice, once in person and once in the group chat and I’d saved it in my calendar and was looking forward to it. The only other two who weren’t invited are a couple who had a baby last week.

I’m really hurt by this and I can’t tell if I’m making something out of nothing. I don’t always show up to events, but I still try in my own ways like initiating group coffee says or holiday events. They’re well aware of my mental and physical health issues, and if it were one of them that struggled with that stuff and was withdrawing from the group I would have made an effort to understand before I potentially stopped inviting them to things. It especially hurt given what they know about my loneliness and how important friendships are to me.

Were any of my texts too much? Is it unreasonable to want to cut myself off from this group right now? They’re all good people and I’m confident are just doing what works for them. Maybe all this needs is communication and reconciliation, but I don’t want to force friendship(s) that just aren’t there, and I don’t feel wanted anymore. :/",1,1748311314.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.67,False
1kwbse0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwbse0,[OC] Homemade Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches - Budget Friendly!,"I decided to do some meal prep for the week while I had an extra day off! Made some delicious Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches... An inspired take from my love of the McMuffin!

I have tried the Jimmy Deans or store brand sandwiches, but they are just so packed with sodium and other ingredients we can barely pronounce, along with the prices! So I wanted to make some with a cut down of the sodium and artificial flavors to have on hand in the freezer when the craving hit. It also saves you money from stopping at the drive through or the fancy coffee shops in the morning that only charge an arm and a leg.

The original recipe posted is for 6 I doubled the recipe for 12 sandwiches; budget below is for 12. 

***Budget Breakdown for Texas area:***

1 dozen eggs $2.50

2x-6 pack of English Muffins $1.59 = $3.18

8oz bag of shredded cheese $2.79

10 pack frozen sausage links $.99

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Total: $9.46 for 12 Sandwiches = $.78ea



# Sausage Egg & Cheese English Muffin Sandwiches 

**Servings** – 6

**Prep Time** – 10 Minutes

**Chill Time:** 15 Minutes

**Cook Time** – 15-20 Minutes

# Ingredients:

* 6 English muffins, *store bought or homemade*
* 6 eggs
* 2 Tablespoons milk or water
* Salt and pepper, *to taste*
* 10 sausage links, *chopped into chunks*
* 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

# Directions:

Heat oven to 350 degrees & spray your mold pan with non stick cooking spray; set aside.

Sautee, grill or microwave sausage links according to package. Chop into chunks. *I personally cut mine in half lengthwise then into fourth chunks.*

In a small bowl crack your 6 eggs, add milk and season with salt and pepper. Whisk until completely combined, light and fluffy.

Pour egg mixture splitting it evenly into the 6 pre-sprayed pan molds.

Add in chunks is sausage and the sprinkle shredded cheese spreading it amongst the 6 eggs.

Place in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. Just until the eggs are darken yellow and slightly golden. *They will continue to cook once you remove them from the oven.*

Let sit in the pan for 15 minutes if you are not serving immediately. See note below.

# Notes:

**For freezer prep:**

Slice open each English muffin. Top each muffin with an egg and close with top half. Wrap each sandwich individually in wax paper. Place in gallon storage bag. Set in freezer once cooled.

**Serving immediately:**

Toast the English muffins, and then butter them to your liking. Add a warm eggs and place on the top of toasted English muffin, close with top half.

These homemade egg McMuffins are delicious just as they are, but feel free to add some ketchup or hot sauce if you like.

If you need a little caffeine to start the morning, these breakfast sandwiches go great with a homemade vanilla sweet cream cold brew iced coffee. You’ll love this combination and the pocket savings!",16,1748311313.0,budgetfood,3,1.0,False

1kwbqsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kwbqsc/this_past_weekend_was_incredibly_distressing/,This past weekend was incredibly distressing,"**This past weekend was incredibly distressing, and I’m still trying to process everything that happened.**

**(Context: My mother hurt her ankle a month ago and as a result, quit her job completely. My wife, my aunt, and I came down south to visit her and pay for going out to eat for lunch and dinner every day this weekend.)** 

On Saturday evening, we arrived at a restaurant a little after 7 p.m., only to be told there was a 90-minute wait. My mother became visibly upset. We decided to make a reservation at another restaurant across the street for 30 minutes later, giving us plenty of time to relocate and find parking.

While taking the elevator down to the garage, a young boy kindly tried to hold the door open for his grandparents. Rather than appreciating the gesture, my mother lashed out. She yelled at the child for not waiting until everyone had exited the elevator and then berated his grandparents for “not teaching him better.” I followed behind, horrified, and sincerely apologized to the boy’s grandfather.

I hurried ahead to start the car, hoping to get the air conditioning going—it was still unbearably hot even at sunset. My wife, trying to be helpful, assisted my mother down the ramp while my aunt and I waited inside the car. Later, I found out that during that walk, my mother directed verbal abuse at my wife, calling her horrible names and making cruel, gendered comments like telling her to “man up.” Just a month ago, my mother had seemed genuinely supportive of my wife’s transition and happy for us as a couple. The whiplash was heartbreaking.

In the car, my aunt gently suggested that my mother consider resuming physical therapy for her sprained ankle. That one simple suggestion triggered a violent outburst. My mother began shouting and cursing, making threatening comments toward my aunt. My aunt calmly told her that if she followed through on any of those threats, she would call the police. I backed my aunt up and made it clear I’d testify on her behalf. My wife reminded my mother that such behavior could have legal consequences. I added, only half-joking, that I’d visit her twice a year in prison. My mother laughed. Then she tried to kick us out of her house.

My aunt refused to be intimidated. She said, “No, we aren’t leaving. Get over it.” We dropped my mother off at home and went on to our dinner reservation without her.

Later that night, my mother texted me her dinner order—including a request for dessert. I brought her food but deliberately left out the bread pudding. I told her they were out, though they weren’t. After the way she treated my wife, I couldn’t bring myself to indulge her with something special.

The next morning, I was woken at 7:30 a.m. by my mother arguing with my aunt again. My aunt tried to stay calm while my mother hurled insults. On my way to the kitchen to make coffee, my mother confronted me aggressively:  
“Did you not put the garbage on the street last night because you didn’t feel like it or because you didn’t want to?”

I had no idea trash collection ran on federal holidays in her town—where I live, it doesn’t. I gave a short explanation, drank my coffee as fast as I could, and started packing. My wife and I had the car packed and the room cleaned within 30 minutes. We were supposed to go to New Orleans with my aunt for lunch and to visit an art gallery I was looking forward to, but my nervous system was completely shot. I told her we’d come back in August—we had to leave immediately.

We made it home after a six-hour drive, part of it through thunderstorms. I ran a hot bath to try to calm down. When I took off the shirt I’d slept in (the same one I’d hurriedly thrown a bra and jeans over), I saw that I had second-degree burns on my chest from the scalding coffee I drank that morning. I’d been so overwhelmed, I hadn’t even registered the pain when it happened.

And then—just to top everything off—my mother sent me a TikTok that said:  
**“The people in your life should be reducing your stress, not causing more of it.”**

I can’t even begin to unpack the irony. She pushed me so far that I didn’t notice I was literally burning myself.

I'm sharing this because I know others here understand how emotionally disorienting it is when someone who’s supposed to love and care for you instead becomes a source of pain and fear. Thank you for holding space for me while I process all of this.",3,1748311190.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I remember listening to this tune a few times back in the \~late 1990's. It's a Trance/Techno kind of song, I assume was made around mid to early '90s. I've been trying to search for it ever since.. Every few years I spend days/weeks listening / searching to no avail.

I managed to recreate it based on what I think it sounded like, but mind you, this was \~25-30 years ago, and I didn't touch GarageBand before so excuse my mediocre skills :)

So, life’s been a little chaotic lately, and I’m realizing I need more connection—with people who get it. I’m 40, based north of Seattle, and coming out of a situationship that made it very clear neither of us was in a good place for anything healthy. But it also reminded me how much I miss having people to talk to, laugh with, and share the messy, beautiful in-between moments.

Someone recently told me I shouldn’t wait until I have my shit together to find my people—and honestly, they’re probably right.

I work full-time (and then some), have a tiny but mighty dog sidekick, and I lean introvert. I’m plus-sized and on the shorter side, but that’s never stopped me from reaching for what I want—or climbing shelves to get it. I’m also running mostly on caffeine and stubbornness—neither of which is doctor-approved. Neurodivergent, which means my brain is a funhouse mirror of thought spirals and creative tangents—but I’m learning to work with it. I love books, slow mornings, and I’m improving my embroidery skills one half-finished project at a time. I’m also trying to get out more—see the mountains, the water, the moody skies that make the PNW what it is.

Looking for friendship, first and foremost. If it becomes something more, cool. But mostly I just want to find good humans to share life with—messy bits and all. I tend to vibe best with people in a similar age range (30s–40s), but I’m open if the energy is solid.

Bought it for 200$ CAD, fully functional, only needed the group head gasket replaced. When I opened it up, I was surprised with the quality of the parts. It has a 200ml brass boiler, a 53mm group head, stock adjustable OPV and pressure gauge, and it comes with the same generic 38mm conical burr grinder found in the Lelit Fred and most combi machines of this period. 

However, it didn't have a solenoid purge valve, and that was unacceptable. I looked up if it would be an easy retrofit but couldn't find much on it. Spoiler alert, it wasn't. So on my quest for dry pucks, I then spent every weekend for the next month buying and making parts, and modifying/restoring/modernizing this damn thing.

I installed an aftermarket solenoid valve by drilling into the boiler in two sport and welding (brazing) a tube that runs from the coffee chamber, through the boiler and around the heating element, and comes out the side. I then made a custom discharge tube that dumps into the drip tray.

I then decided to modify the grinder coffee chute, as the original had a long horizontal section that would clog-up and the retention was off the charts. With a mechanical engineering degree and a 3d printer, this was no challenge. I then proceeded to also model and print a worm gear and bracket to upgrade the grinder adjustment. 

I also rewired the grinder to add a toggle switch and installed a time delay circuit to have time-dosing. That was a pain, as the casing of the machine is deep, narrow and full of sharp edges. In the end, the result is worth it.

Finally, I wrapped the hole machine in a mat black vinyl wrap, and hand-made a bunch of wood bits out of the same wood. I think it turned out awesome. 

If you'd like to see pictures of the whole process, I posted them on Imgur, with photos, videos, descriptions, schematics and wiring diagram. Enjoy!

This was upsetting to hear because I had shared with D in confidence and expressed that it was private. So to learn that she confirmed I had spoken to her about the fight was very disappointing. I told her this and she told me she wasn’t comfortable lying… so now I feel like I can’t trust her and that if anyone were to ask her something about me or inquire about a conversation I’ve had with her that she will just cave because not sharing what I said to her in private is “lying” to other parties.

1kwba2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kwba2g/rf_humanity_forsaken/,[RF] Humanity: Forsaken,"# Washington D.C. — November 7th, 2051

“Madame President, we just lost contact with the European Union.”

The words sliced through the bunker’s stale air like a scalpel through a corpse. The speaker, a clean shaven young man in dark green fatigues, stood rigid beside the Resolute Desk. His voice was quiet, calm, almost too calm, like a man trying not to wake a sleeping beast.

President Amira Halim didn’t look at him. Her eyes were locked on the bunker’s communications switchboard, where a ghastly green light flickered one last time before fading to black. Berlin had gone dark.

Her fingers massaged her left temple, slow, circular, automatic. A lit Treasurer cigarette sagged from her lips, ash trembling on the edge of collapse. Her dark blue blazer, wrinkled and spotted with stale coffee, clung to her like dead skin. Behind her, the fluorescent lights hummed with mechanical indifference, spilling cold light onto the wood-paneled walls. A silent tomb, dressed in civility.

“Get a drone over the capital,” she said, voice hoarse. “We can’t operate off guesswork.”

The officer tapped rapidly on a tablet, his expression carefully neutral. But when he looked up again, something had broken. The young Lieutenant tried to look into her eyes but failed. 

“Madame...” he started, then swallowed hard. “The drone over Berlin… stopped transmitting. Mid-feed.”

She blinked. Once. Twice. Then the silence cracked.

“Then reroute Paris. Or Istanbul. I don’t care where it comes from. Get me something.”

Her voice flared like a match, hot, sudden, volatile. The cigarette tumbled from her lips, scattering red-hot embers across the oak desk. Before it could burn out, she slammed a ceramic mug down over it. Whiskey-laced coffee sloshed out the sides, mingling with the ash. The caffeine did nothing. Neither did the alcohol. Not anymore.

On the switchboard, more lights began to blink out, methodically, mechanically.

Berlin. Paris. Istanbul. London. Rome. Madrid. Athens.

Now **Oslo**.

She noticed that one. Oslo wasn’t just another name on the map. It was the Nords, pioneers in drone defense and counter-intrusion systems. If they’d gone silent, this wasn’t a glitch. This was a warning.

“Madame President...” the officer whispered, trembling. “All Union contacts are down. Every drone. Every feed. It’s… it’s like they just vanished.” 

He choked on the last word. He stood at attention but his knees shook. His eyes glistened. Sweat streaked his face, cutting vulnerable lines through the tension. The tablet in his grip drooped, like his hope.

She didn’t scream this time. She just stood. Her loafers creaked as she rose to her toes. Her bronze complexion had gone ashen.

“Contact the North African Federation,” she said quietly. “Get us eyes on Europe.”

The officer nodded, too fast, too eager, and turned on his heel. He didn’t walk. He fled.

“Somebody get Algiers on the line! Right fucking now!”

His voice echoed through the control room bouncing off concrete walls slowly fading  to nothing. Operators moved like wisps, quickly abandoning European contact protocols, chasing new signals. No one spoke above a whisper. Barely anyone spoke.

Alone in her office, the President pulled a fresh Treasurer from a brass case. Her hands trembled. The gold lighter, a gift from her wife, caught the bunker lights, the Seal of the Presidency engraved beneath the flame well. The eagle’s gaze stared up at her, cold and unblinking.

It took three tries to strike the flame. When it finally bloomed, it cast long shadows across her worn face. She inhaled, but tasted nothing. 

Then, the alarm hit.

**BLARING SIRENS. RED STROBES. BLOODLIGHT.**

The bunker screamed.

Her monitor came to life. Not with intelligence feeds. Not with topographic scans. With a photo. The Alps in spring, snow-capped and serene. In the foreground, two women stood arm-in-arm, laughing. Her wife. The First Lady. A frozen moment from a world that no longer existed. No longer could exist.

Then came the message:

**MISSILE DETECTED — 3 MILES ABOVE D.C.**

She didn’t move.

She had clawed through eight years of endless diplomacy to stop this. Tried to cool the Pacific. Tried to stall the EU’s advance in Sudan. Tried to hold peace together with duct tape and dying promises. But the damage had been done long before her. The Great Recession of 2041 had shattered America’s illusion of dominance. The previous administration had retreated. The East and South had risen.

And in the void… monsters grew bold.

**Terror attacks. Digital plagues. Executions streamed to billions.**

Peace was a ghost. The world had already chosen war.

Now, someone had chosen to end it.

She reached beneath the desk and yanked the chain from her neck. The titanium beads hit the floor with a metallic clatter. Her fingers wrapped around the matte black case hidden beneath the desk.

Protocol Zero.

She inserted the key and turned it.

**Click.**

The pressurized hiss, a cobra uncoiling. 

The resin case lifted, revealing two crimson keys already waiting. Waiting for this moment. Waiting for *her*.

She turned both counterclockwise.

**Another hiss. Another click.**

The protective panel retracted.

**A red button stared back at her. Not Crimson. A Deep Blood Red.**

She hovered. Just for a breath.

And then she pressed.

**Click. Lock. Final.**

Above her, a screen flickered to life.

**2051 WARHEADS LAUNCHED.**

The button glowed softly in the dark. A strange, pathetic comfort.

She pulled hard on the cigarette until her lungs burned and her eyes teared up.

“Sorry, God,” she choked out through a plume of smoke. “Humanity has decided to forsake the world you gave us.”

A single tear slipped down her cheek and landed on her trembling hand, still resting on the console.

Somewhere above, silos yawned open, dragons woken from a deep slumber. Steel titans screamed skyward. The world, having reached the edge, chose the fall.

The walls began to shake. The ground rumbled in recognition of its own death sentence.

She slid to the floor. Curled beneath the desk like a child seeking shelter from a storm too large to name.

Eyes closed.

Sleep, long a stranger, finally returned to claim her.

1kwb8v6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwb8v6,At a loss with this kitchen layout,"I feel like this kitchen layout is strange and I can't land on an improved use of the space. 

Here is what we're planning to do:
Pantry space will be increased (depth + width, out left though - not into the kitchen).
Swap out the gas range for an induction cooktop + deep drawers for cookware underneath. Add a wall mounted hood above for adequate ventilation.
Open shelving to the right & left of the hood. 
Add a wall microwave oven combo.
Have bottom cabinets (top of picture) run all the way to the window wall on the right - the space near the window will be the coffee/tea bar (espresso machine, open shelves for mugs, etc). 

This is where this setup becomes an issue. I want counter space on both sides of the cooktop, so if I add the wall oven to the right of the cooktop it feels too close to the peninsula. If I get rid of the peninsula I lose precious counter space. If I bump out the peninsula the breakfast nook area starts to get awkwardly small - though I don't intend to use that as a breakfast nook anyway (the family room will be the dining room - so no need to have 2 dining spaces so close by). 

Welcome any ideas on how to best utilize this space given the above upgrades, and ideally keeping the work triangle as-is, or close to it. ",1,1748309642.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

1kwb6aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kwb6aj/how_many_homes_have_mice_in_the_attic_without/,How many homes have mice in the attic… without knowing it?,"Okay, here’s the deal. For a while now, I’ve been hearing scratching noises above my bay window, nothing in the living spaces. My gut said “mice” or maybe “squirrel squatters.” So I called in the pros.

Pest Company #1: Tossed a few bait stations in the house, threw some poison into the attic like it was a war zone, looked around and said, “We don’t see anything, but to be safe we put some baits.”
Uh… yeah, thanks? Super reassuring when I’m still hearing them.

Company #2 (Wildlife control): Whole different vibe. These folks do exclusion work. They’ll seal up every nook, caulk the soffit edges, install one-way doors, and they don’t use poison. It comes with a 5-year warranty. They’ll do their work on Friday.

Today: A roofer came by to install soffit vents. I casually mentioned the mystery noises, and he said, “Hmm. Might’ve seen a mouse earlier, disappeared into the attic.” He slapped some poison into every opening just in case and also caulked around the bay window and its capping. He mentioned that some areas he caulked could have been entry points. 

Now the noises have stopped. But it’s unlikely poison worked that fast. So either:
	1.	The entry point got sealed, and they’re locked out.
	2.	They’re dead already.
	3.	Or… they’re still up there, nesting like a tiny, whiskered civilization I’ll never hear because of the thick insulation.

So naturally, I googled:
“How many attics have mice unknowingly?” Google’s like: “Oh, over 95%.”
Apparently, most mice stay in the attic, never venture into living spaces, and unless you have paper-thin insulation, you might never hear a thing.

So now I’m spiraling:
Is it true? Is my attic secretly Airbnb-ing to rodents while I blissfully sip coffee downstairs?

The three of us chatted and when the other mother found out about my interest in beginners pottery, she asked for my cell number so we could talk/learn from each other.  Mind you this was probably the second time I have laid eyes on this person.
So, I was surprised when I received a text from her to indeed, connect to talk about pottery. Okay, how should we do this?
She suggested a coffee/ bakery place, which I knew off and didn’t smell overwhelming like coffee, so I said okay. (hate the smell of coffee)
We met mid last week, and it wasn’t about pottery.  It was because she learned from my DIL, I was divorced, and in part, why.
Seems she and her husband of 3 years were reminiscing about their history as as a couple. She said she was so excited when he proposed. He told her his parents told him he should marry her, as they had dated for 3 years.  He said he told his parents he wasn’t sure he loved her, and his parents responded, “You love her, you just don’t know it yet.”
She told me she did a haha, and changed the subject, but she felt like her marriage was a sham, and her trust in her husband and her judgment was wrecked.
She was coming to me to ask my advice as she knew I was divorced!
I suggested to her to think carefully, and we would chat/meet again.  If we meet again, it will need to be for cocktails!
What would you recommend I advise her?

# 🛒 Ingredients:

* 200g cream cheese (I used Philadelphia)
* 250ml sweetened condensed milk
* 300ml whipping cream
* 300ml warm milk + 1 tbsp cappuccino powder
* Biscuits (ladyfingers or tea biscuits work great)
* 200g chocolate + 60ml milk (for ganache)

# 👩‍🍳 Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix cream cheese and condensed milk.
2. Option 1: Add whipping cream directly. Option 2 (for thicker texture): Whip the cream separately and fold it in.
3. Dip the biscuits in the cappuccino-flavored warm milk.
4. In a dish, layer soaked biscuits + cream mixture.
5. Melt chocolate with 60ml milk and pour over the top as ganache.
6. Refrigerate until fully set (a few hours or overnight).

That’s it! Creamy, chocolatey, and perfect with a coffee on the side. Let me know if you try it or make your own twist on it! 🤍🍫☕

End of 2023 we ran into financial issues (sort term) while saving money before apartment hunting in the city she had offered multiple times we can live with her while we “sort things out”. The goal was to be as quick as possible, 2 weeks in tensions start to rise I’ve done something but I’m not sure what? I can see she is angry with me? 

So I ask her she said I looked at her wrong? I apologised we moved on but from then on it just got worse her mood would change like the weather I was crying to my partner about it at least twice a week. She was so passive aggressive, and just mean. We spilt all cooking down the middle me and MIL would alternate nights, it got to a point where I hated being down stairs I isolated myself for the last 6 weeks of the 3 months. Coming down in the morning for a coffee “hi hello good morning” stay for 15 mins then up to the room, at lunch I’d come down when I know she wasn’t in the kitchen and then dinner we all eat together I do the dishes and excuse myself at about 9pm they watch tv together till like 11pm and then he comes to the room, both my partner and me work remotely so the room we stayed it we also worked in we had enough space but it did star to feel small when you in it all the time my only escape was the gym for 1hr a day. 

My partner has openly said since he could’ve done more but didn’t know what to do it was a balancing act for him also he could see his mum was unhappy and then I was vocal about my unhappiness to him. 

Anyway skip to the end of my stay I she has said to my partner that she doesn’t like how I am controlling him changing him and that I call all the shots, I’m lazy and ungrateful and this one hurt disrespectful. All I had tried to be is respectful I come from a culture where this is very important. I asked her if we could speak my goal was to apologise and understand what I had done wrong with a goal to mend the relationship. From when I asked if we could speak she waited one day and said yes what do you want to talk about I addressed the things she said to my partner and said I’m sorry I never wanted to come across as any of those things. She lunges in I have a health epilepsy and sometimes it flares up badly my seizures happen at night but they wake me up my partner helps me if I need help and that’s it. 

She said I used my seizures to control him? And people around me… my seizures started out of the blue when I was 21 and almost killed me, my family was in the hospital for 2 months and I have done a lot of therapy to deal with the trauma, and guilt I felt for putting people I love through so much. This is just one of the horrible things she said. At that point I asked my partner to come and join us and repeated what she said “do I use my seizures to control you?” I was scared if he didn’t join us he might not believe me because a lot of her passive aggressive comments and things were always down when he is not in the room. 

He answered no. 

She then continued on all the ways i was fcked sorry I don’t have a better work it was horrible I just sat there I apologised that she felt that way I didn’t raise my voice. Went upstairs cried came back downstairs and said I have apologised many times but she has not apologised once and in the spirit of moving forward. She said my apologies mean nothing it’s actions that count. She said that she has nothing to be sorry for because everything she did was unknowingly or they were her opinions which are based in xyz examples and facts. So no she has nothing to apologise for. My partner stood there through this and said nothing. 

I called my dad to pick me up and left about two hours later. My partner joined me in 2 days the date we were supposed to leave and we cried he apologised it’s been a long road forgiving him and I think I’m still angry sometimes. He went back to her and told her she was wrong about me and did therapy and listened to my cry for months. Our relationship is fine it’s just her.

He told her we were in therapy about this and she asked to join I said no. She can’t even apologise or own her part what is the point in therapy? 

Anyway it’s been a year this month and we exchange merry Christmas happy birthday texts. I don’t want to but I don’t know what to do she is his only family and means so much to him. I don’t know what to do? ",2,1748308545.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.75,False

4/24
We started our day by dropping our kids off at my parents’ house, and then we drove the four hours North to Orlando. Is there some guilt about doing an adult only trip to Disney when I know my five year old loves Disney? Yes, but we often do trips catered specifically to him and his brother (6 months old, so hardly of an opinion at this point).

Anyway, we left Miami at 8 am and arrived at Disney’s Yacht Club resort just shy of 11:40 am. So, a bit quicker than four hours. We had booked a resort view, but I put in my notes that if it was at all possible, we’d love to switch to a water view.  Our room was ready from the moment we got to the hotel. Check in is technically at three, but we were in our room by 11:50 am. When we got to our room on the fourth floor, upon opening the door we realized we had been upgraded to a water view with a view of Crescent Lake and Storm Along Bay (currently under construction). But what was best, was that we faced EPCOT and would be able to see some of the fireworks from our balcony. I checked my app to see if we had been charged for the upgrade, but it still read as resort view and had the same prices. 

We dropped our things off and went to explore the boardwalk for lunch. We grabbed a sandwich to split at the Boardwalk Deli. I didn’t love how much aioli was on it, so my husband ate it. We picked up a raspberry champagne cake slice from the The Cake Bakeshop to-go side. We happily meandered through the Boardwalk Hotel and Beach Club side of the resort before heading back to our room. Despite being before dinner, we both sampled a bite of the cake. It was good, light, and moist. I wouldn’t buy another slice for $22 though. It was fun for the experience, but there are better sweets to be bought around Disney.

My husband announced he was a bit tired and needed a nap before dinner. He ended up sleeping three hours (the joys of parenthood sleep deprivation!). As much as Disney vacations are for fun and exploring, the fact that our kids were home with grandparents also meant we were able to get much needed rest. 

At 5:00 pm, I poked him to get ready for dinner. We had a reservation at Flying Fish. We walked back over to the Boardwalk, and were seated for dinner very quickly. He ordered the potato crusted snapper, and I got the filet mignon. His fish was good, perhaps a little over, but the crispy potato wrap around the fish was great. The filet mignon on the other hand was way overcooked. I ordered medium rare, and got something bordering on well done. I didn’t want to complain, so I ate half of it and my husband had the rest. We ordered after dinner coffee desserts. We got the Boardwalk Cafe drink (bourbon, coffee, whipped cream), and an espresso martini. They were quite strong, but good. 

When we got back to our hotel room, we showered and then watched the fireworks from the balcony. It was very romantic. My husband also brought up some chocolate covered strawberries he had made back home, and some prosecco, and kept them in a cooler on the drive up. So we each had a strawberry and some bubbly. So just a little extra romance for our night. 

4/25
The next morning, I naturally woke up a little before 6 am, but felt wildly well rested as I didn’t wake up at 4 am due to a screaming baby. This post makes it sound like I don’t like my kids, I do, I just cannot emphasize how having a proper amount of uninterrupted sleep can change a human’s energy levels. I made myself some black tea in the keurig, and took a very relaxing shower. I love that the Yacht Club hotel has a handheld shower in addition to the overhead. We also had a double vanity area. So I give the room an A+ for bathroom space. I took time doing my sunscreen and make up. I had a pink pair of sequined Minnie Ears, and I decided to have some extra fun and place some pink crystal decals around my eyes. It’s the little things. 

My husband decided that he needed to steam his shorts before heading out. He might be the only person steaming clothes before going to Disney. By 8:00 we had our bags packed with extra sunscreen, hand lotion, and raincoats (he has a purse that straps around his chest, and I have a little backpack purse). 

We walked the five minutes to EPCOT and were in line for Guardians by 8:15, they started moving the line at 8:28, and we were on the ride by 9:02. We got the song Conga. It’s not my favorite song, but being on Guardians is amazing no matter what. 

We then walked over to Les Halles in France to get a croissant with ham and cheese, and a beignet. Croissants and cheese are one of the world’s finest creations. Once we finished, we decided to walk around and take pictures with some of the topiaries while we waited for our friends to arrive. They live about an hour away, and had to acclimate their daughter to the babysitter before leaving. While waiting, we grabbed snow cones from the Japan Pavilion, and watched the Voices of Liberty performance in the America Pavilion. They always sound so beautiful. 

When our friends arrived, we headed back to France as they wanted quiche and croissants. They went to the bakery, and my husband and I got a goat cheese croissant from the Fleur de Lys booth. The croissant had a good amount of goat cheese stuffed inside, so it was a thumbs up from me. 

We then walked to Canada because they had goat cheese poutine. I’m a cheese lover with lactose intolerance… the amount of lactaid pills I went through that day was ungodly. The goat cheese poutine was very okay. The fries weren’t crispy, the goat cheese was just cut into huge cubes. I think it would be a lot better if the fries were crispy and the cheese was melted. I had a couple and then decided to save room for better things; things like a mango cream liqueur dole whip. 

One of our friends isn’t a coaster lover, so she decided to wander on her own, while we went off to wait in the line for Guardians again. My husband got a margarita for the wait. The wait time was posted at 75 minutes. It took 80 minutes to the second. We know this because we all placed bets, and my husband won. This time we got Everybody Wants to Rule the World (best song). 

We then went to the Moana water walk through. It was at that point where I missed my kids, because my five year old would have loved that. After that we grabbed some fish and chips from the Yorkshire booth. The fries were okay, and the fish was too much batter to fish ratio. At that time the UK pavilion had Command Presence performing British rock songs, so we enjoyed that. 

Our friends wanted to grab gelato before they left, so we headed over to Italy where they got a cookies and cream gelato, and an affogato. My husband and I shared an affogato (espresso shot with a scoop of vanilla gelato). Our friends then had to leave as their babysitter would be done at 7:00 pm. They left at exactly the right moment as it began to pour down. Luckily, or rather, plannedly we had our raincoats. 

The raincoats of course did nothing for our shoes, but we’ve weathered many a storm at a theme park. We don’t call ourselves Floridians for nothing. Sunscreen and raincoats are the name of the game here.  We decided to hop back into the line for Guardians. Yes, we did standby for Guardians three times in one day. What lives we lead! I suppose the first might not count due to early entry. Anyway, it was a heavy amount of rain. Not so thick you couldn’t see in front of you, but still enough to make a 90 degree day chill you up. The line for Guardians snaked outside, but what did that matter when the reward of a smooth coaster was but 90 minutes away?  

As we waited in the rain, there were some people who tried to cut the line. They were very loudly booed by many of the people in line, but nobody did anything about it. In fact there were several other people who pulled the, “excuse me, excuse me, I’m trying to catch up with my party,” trick. Nobody said anything, but many an eye roll were shared among the patiently waiting. 

We got on the ride in about 80 minutes, so ten minutes faster than the posted wait time. This time we got Disco Inferno, which we’ve never gotten before, so it made for an exciting and fresh experience. I’ve yet to get One Way or Another, or I Ran. So those are future hopes. I’m out here trying to collect songs like Pokémon. We have gotten Everybody Wants to Rule the World three times now, Conga twice, September once, and now, Disco Inferno once. My least favorite is September, which I understand many people adore as seen from the polls on this very subreddit.

When we got off the ride, it was raining a little less than before. We debated going for a fourth, but decided that taking off our squelching shoes and a hot shower sounded just a bit more divine. We walked back to the hotel and picked up a bananas foster bread pudding on the way from the booth at the America Pavilion. I think it’s called Magnolia terrace. It was good, but I wish it were gooier on the inside. 

Being able to walk back to the hotel was amazing! By the time we got back to the hotel we had done ten miles on the dot, so I felt good about myself.  When we got in we immediately showered and I made myself a hot green tea. We watched fireworks from the balcony and then fell asleep feeling nice and cozy. 

4/26
I woke up unprompted at 6:50, again, feeling so refreshed from uninterrupted sleep. I made some black tea, and let it cool while I went down to the marketplace next to the lobby to get a Mickey Waffle and bacon for my husband. 

I got back to the hotel and decided to take my tea and waffle to the balcony to enjoy the view of crescent lake. All was beautiful and serene. I had my waffle, but just as I was finishing my waffle, the world’s most giant crow flew at me. I shrieked and ran in. This is not my first encounter with overly-bold Disney wildlife. Back in 2018 we stayed in the cabins at Fort Wilderness, and an aggressive aviary stole half a sandwich straight out of my hand. The birds are frightening! 

Once I sufficiently emotionally recovered from the crow, we went back on the balcony sans food, and enjoyed our time until minutes before check out. When we checked out, we drove to Disney Springs for lunch. We went to Eet by Maneet. We got the chicken tikka poutine. I’m usually wary of fusions, but wow, who knew that cheese, chicken tikka masala, and French fries were the combination I needed in my life. I honestly want to go back again just for that. It was hands down better than anything we got at Epcot. 

After lunch, we went to the tea and spice exchange and smelled and looked at everything. I was tempted to buy some spice mixes, but rationalized that it wasn’t necessary. We then went to Erin McKennas to get some cookies and cake to bring back to our allergy ridden five year old. We finally went to the ganachery to get chocolates to thank my parents for taking care of the kids. Then we loaded up in the car to go home, which is where writing this trip review finds me; on the way home wistfully thinking of the glorious hotel room and beautiful feeling of Cosmic Rewind.

*FRONTIER WORLD INFITAR-8217*

*JULY 5, 2026 (HUMAN GREGORIAN CALENDAR)*



He didn’t miss the taste of blood in his coffee.

He still remembered that night. Kurzikstan. Nasra. 2004. The kid. A little ferret kid, for fuck’s sake. Ran up for candy, and the next second a wave of heat and blown-off body parts were hurtling around the bazaar.

He’d been sitting inside the compound, drinking a cup exactly like the one before him. Some sort of Baristan blend, imported from offworld. Hella expensive. It cost him about half the day’s pay, which sucked because he was just a Sergeant at the time. So maybe 100 credits tops.

To have it *transported there*. *By drone*. The actual transportation fee for the deep-space haulers that had rolled in the week before was about ten thousand credits. Kurzikstan was as backwater a shithole as any assault trooper unlucky enough to be busted down a rank for striking a superior could go.

Man, he still missed that coffee.

Major Karn Mantueffel stared down at the brimming red mug before him, some cheap knockoff fabrication they definitely printed in a Xeth sweatshop factory. It was illegal to use children in manufacturing and utterly pointless, since even shipbuilding was automated these days, but who gives a damn when you can pay some poor twenty-year-old schmuck to do it for free?

He took another sip of his coffee and nearly spat it out. Infitarians couldn’t brew jack shit. Not that he really blamed them. Most of the planet, like any other Umaffid ex-colony, was stuck in the medieval period. Women still went around wearing burqas, men in turbans, and militants in both, but with VK-47s hidden beneath their robes and sometimes suicide vests.

There was a buzz on his earpiece and a filtered voice announced, “Sir, our visitor is here to see you. He’s alone.”

“Pass him through.”

""Sir, I don’t think –”

“Lieutenant, just do your fucking job. We aren’t being paid to play detective. You wanna go back home to Holt? To those industrial skies, the slag rivers, breathe in shit for thirty more years until they press-gang you into the Army again, but under some disposable penal unit?”

It was an unnecessary insult and deeply personal, but Karn wasn’t in the mood for defiance today. He had to get this done.

“No, sir.”

“Then let him through.”

“Aye, sir.”

Karn forced himself to drain the rest of his mug – too many credits wasted on it already – and slid it to one side before folding his hands flat on the steel table and waiting.

The door to the shipping container soon slid open, and a man entered.

A snow leopard.

He looked about seventy, so young enough but approaching middle-age, with a huge scar running across his face. He wore a red beret, the only colour on his entire uniform, since the rest of him was in mismatched assault trooper armour and a bulletproof vest.

“Master above, did you step out of Soldier of Fortune Magazine or what, Rickard?” Karn joked.

“Spare it, Karn,” Rickard grumbled. “We’re here to talk business. You brought the wine, right?”

Karn motioned behind him.

“Hand me one. I need a drink after today.”

“It’s your funeral.” Karn reached into the crate of wine bottles sitting behind his chair, and took out one for Rickard. Rickard took it, passed it between his hands, and then popped the cork with a slight hiss. He frowned at its contents, narrowed his eyes at Karn, then frowned back inside the bottle, before finally relenting and drinking half in one swig.

Karn coughed politely. “Shall we begin?”

“Skip the kangaroo court and go straight for the execution shot,” Rickard snarled.

“That’s insulting to kangaroos.”

“Half of them are muscled up on steroids on every fucking Frontier dogshit colony filled with too many cheap whores and vat-grown beer, and the other half are all painters or doctors or some liberal arts crap. Their existence is insulting.”

“Relax, Rickard. No one’s coming to bite off your head. Except Black Box, maybe.”

“So let them bite.”

Karn sighed. Rickard was no fun at this age anymore. The pair had served in the Brushfire Wars which ended just the year prior. That was even worse than Kurzikstan. The Ascendancy deployed about a billion soldiers across the most violent Frontier worlds – and then been bombed, shot, stabbed, crushed, and rioted into forcing their hand and glassing half of them.

Which meant *more* bombing, shooting, stabbing, crushing, and everyone losing their minds in three stampedes a week that entailed even *police mechs* being dragged down and beaten into scrap metal.

What a shitshow.

But not as bad as Rickard’s was about to be.

Karn flicked out a small remote from his pocket and activated a holoprojector mounted in the upper right-hand corner of the container. Immediately it hummed to life, before a bank of holoscreens displaying various images strobed in midair.

He zoomed in one: that of a long black crate that looked to be about ten meters long and two wide.

“You know this one, don’t you, Rickard,” Karn deadpanned.

“I do. The same one that led me here. And presumably sent my men to an asteroid gulag.” Rickard took another deep mouthful. “So? What’s the verdict, bossman?”

“I’m not your boss. I don’t even call the shots.”

“You have their blessing.”

“There’s a difference between being brave and accepting your fate, Rickard.”

“Touche.”

Karn zoomed in on the crate. “So. Let’s start with the basics. Tell me where you found it.”

Rickard took a deep breath. Karn mentally swore he almost witnessed a vein pop.

“We were in Zone 17 based on NAVSAT footage,” Rickard explained. “Tracking a militant convoy from the Yahudi Network. Y’know, the same guys who kept fucking up that one humanitarian mission down in Arrakun thirty klicks south.”

Karn nodded along, already disinterested.

“Well, we hit ‘em with a cluster suicider. The usual pair. One did overwatch and the other airbus and hit those fuckers with bomblets. Karn, don’t you fucking fall asleep on me, or I swear to the Master I’ll rip that smug smile off your prick face.”

“Keep going, Rickard.”

Rickard finished the rest of his bottle. “Wine first.”

“A real negotiator, aren’t you? No wonder Steel Front contracted you. Your sparkly ass always did know where to find the money.” Karn whipped out another bottle and popped the cork this time for the leopard. “Think of it as a professional courtesy.”

“Suck my dick.”

“Funny. I thought you lost it after that one stripper – what’s her name? Evelyn? – swallowed you too hard.”

“Get to the point, Mantueffel.”

Karn zoomed in on another image, that of a dozen burning pickup trucks and dead jihadis lying with shattered corpses strewn about in the sand. “You caught the Yahudi with their pants down, I’ll give you that. But what you did with their ordnance was unacceptable. Higher-ups wanted to know what was inside it. Your men released the serpent before breaking the seal.”

“My men were detained and punished for breaching contract,” Rickard replied harshly, his tone flat and accusatory.

“Yes, but the issue is that *you* also technically breached it. These were *your* men. *Your* responsibility. You are being held liable for both the financial and scientific damage incurred.”

“You sound like a lawyer, you know that, you shitfuck old otter?”

Karn smiled from ear to ear.

Rickard downed half the bottle. “So. What’s the verdict? Seven months’ hard labour in your blacksite gulags? Maybe a personal visit from one of those Enforcer “supermen” you have lying around? I’ve seen them on the news.”

“Would you prefer mining rocks all day that could clearly be done by a minemech or be torn in half like a rotting phone book?”

“I’d prefer if you just shot me.”

Karn’s smile grew even wider.

Rickard, still oblivious, drained his bottle entirely. “You mind if I have another crack at the purple stuff or are we done?”

Karn arched an eyebrow. “No, no. I’ll hand you one.” He reached behind him again, this time passing *two* bottles of wine to the PMC. “There. Drink up.”

“You’re not even popping the corks?”

“Ohhhh, is someone a little baby? Does someone need a corkscrew?”

Rickard huffed but popped one’s cork and began to down it.

Karn leaned back in his chair. “Listen, bro. I secured you something of a deal. I can waive a prison sentence for you *if* you help me out with something.”

“Name it.”

Karn leaned forward, fingers steepled, a dangerous glint in his eye. “I need you to sell out your men. Hand them over. So we can run a few tests. With the ordnance. Box needs a return on their investment.”

“*Their* investment? From what I saw it was some weird parasite-looking thing. Latched on to those dead bodies like barnacles to a tanker ship. The ones on the water.”

“I’ve been to Terrestria. I know what a tanker is.”

“Funny, I thought you were an ancient relic.”

“It *is* from Black Moon,” Karn admitted, taking back one of the wine bottles he’d offered Rickard and having a sip himself. “The virologist spooks there apparently cooked up some real nasty shit. They said it could reanimate the dead. Naturally, the feds are intrigued.”

Rickard’s breathing became more bated. “You made my team handle a Class One biohazard and didn’t inform us.”

“Yes and no.”

Rickard’s claws tightened around his bottle. “Okay, Karn. It’s *your* turn to explain now.”

“How about I show you?”

“What?”

Karn rolled his eyes. “Oh come on, Rickard. I’ll show you what the thing does. What I know. And even though your men are cuffed and being watched like hawks by my battle mechs, I’m sure they’ll want to know what they risked their lives and rep for.”

“And their contract.”

Karn rose stiffly from his seat. “Do you want to see or not?”

“I’ll bite.” Rickard rose as well and joined him.

They stepped out into the chilly night air. Jawani tended to cool down this time of day, like most deserts had a habit of doing. Hot enough to fry a uni chick looking for a suntan when it was light, and cold enough to store your ice cream sandwiches outside when it was dark. For this sole reason alone Karn was happy they’d issued A/C in all trooper armour back in ‘87.

Rickard followed Karn not without some suspicion to a concrete bunker, where two of Karn’s troopers saluted stiffly. He didn’t like how they were glorified sentries now, but that was probably better than having them blown apart by a VBIED out in the rest of Qurzdhof. 

They entered, the titanium door latching shut behind them, and descended down a badly-lit staircase.

The pair stopped before another titanium door, this time flanked by two battle mechs who saluted on instinct. Well, more accurately based on programming. They were still dumb as hell and could take an hour to be outmaneuvered by an insurgent on a good day.

Inside Rickard was met with a terrible sight.

Four assault troopers with NODs down over their visors stood at the far wall. They each carried an M230C SAW. The NODs were functionally useless, but Karn had chosen them for intimidation.

On the floor before them lay all six of his squad – his team – shot through their necks, backs, and skulls. A puddle of red swirled around both men’s boots.

Karn’s earpiece buzzed. A voice crackled, “*Eagle-One, this is Harbinger Actual. No loose ends*.”

“Copy, Actual. No loose ends,” Karn replied smoothly, even as Rickard’s stunned eyes moved over his murdered team, to the troopers with NODs, and then back to his team.

“I know you understand.” Karn’s hand dropped to his holster.

“What in –” Rickard snarled, beginning to whip his head around.

He heard a sound like thunder, and then his world went black.



Karn stood there, watching as Rickard’s brains and pieces of his skull floated down a small crimson river and spread out across the concrete. It was a shame, betraying the man like this. But it had to be done. Orders were orders. One did not simply contradict Black Box – they would always find someone else, often right the next day. Besides, the bonus for this was enticing …

He looked at the troopers. “Bring in the sample. Use it on these fools. Then let them rampage around the base. Put a timed lock on the door for two hours. That’s all the time we’ll need to jump ship.”

The four all nodded and left the room to retrieve the crate.

The same one Rickard and co had fought so hard to get … and would now be the next unwilling subjects of.

It was a terrible fate, Karn knew. He had seen the videos, heard the screams, when they’d called him into Black Moon five days ago. It was a terrible choice he’d been “encouraged” to make. 

Alas, Rickard was a mercenary. No one at home would miss a dead merc.

He pulled out a cigarette from his pocket, and then a lighter, before flicking the cancer-stick to life.

He drew slowly, inhaling the sweet, sexy smell of Baristan tobacco. And then prayed to whatever gods were listening that for his roster of stupid, even crazy choices, this had been the one that would finally matter a damn.

1kwar72,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwar72,Full day of eating - 3k edition,"Some context - I'm 30M, 6'1"" ,  ~163 lbs


I'm eating and lifting at maintenance for the last 2.5 months. In April, I was eating 2750 calories daily, but I was slowly losing weight. I didn't really want to lose weight while I'm only lifting 2x per week, so I increased my calories to 3000 daily at the start of May. Interestingly, I've still lost ~3-4 lbs this month. 


I know, I get mixed feedback in this sub when I talk about my maintenance calories being so high. Obviously it's easier to eat high volume when I'm able to just eat more calories. But y'all, my hunger is constantly through the roof. Even at 3k, I have to do some volume hacking to keep myself in check. Today was the first time in a while that I actually used a measurable amount of oil in the pan for each meal, as opposed to just spraying a little Pam. but it was totally worth it. Noticable increase in flavor compared to recent meals.


Anyway, I felt good about today. These meals were VERY yummy. Probably A LOT of food for the average person. Somehow still getting more shredded 🤷🏼


Disclosures - I tracked everything except seasonings. So total today was probably more like ~3,050. But given the context above, I'm not concerned about the extra 50ish calories. Screenshots show my ingredients, but I'll list below anything that I didn't track. Salt to taste on everything. 


Breakfast -

Garlic powder

Sriracha 

Mexican oregano Leaves


Lunch -
