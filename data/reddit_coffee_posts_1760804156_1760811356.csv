Bluewood State Park 
(A reimagining of The Rake by the 4Chan community of 2005)

June 11th: 
My therapist recommended I start keeping a daily journal, and I have no reason not to with a job that has no internet or TV. So, hi. I guess‚Ä¶ how the hell do people write journals? I don‚Äôt know, guess I'll just act like I'm talking to someone, it‚Äôs the best I can do. 

My name is Linus Barnes, and I work as a park ranger. I‚Äôve recently been moved out to Bluewood State Park, out in northern California. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs called Bluewood, the trees aren‚Äôt blue, nothing really is. Maybe it‚Äôs just the people naming it wanting to parody redwood, probably out of jealousy. This place isn‚Äôt a giant park made to protect a rare species, it‚Äôs a small woodland where teens and college students like to get wasted (leaving trash everywhere by the way) and crackheads go to make shitty shelters. It‚Äôs a garbage park, essentially. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone besides the rangers have been out here sober for years, hell I think half of the rangers here aren‚Äôt sober either. Guess they figure if the guests are wasted half the time they get to indulge as well.  I literally only came here because they were desperate for new rangers that weren‚Äôt passed out before 9pm. Thank god I‚Äôm both sober and practically nocturnal.

Oh yeah, I guess I should say why I‚Äôve begun writing this in the first place.

I‚Äôve had sleeping problems for years now, it‚Äôs why I moved to the night shifts. I really just sleep in the early morning, and stay awake from 2pm to 7am. I don‚Äôt know how it happens, like at all. I went to a buncha doctors, they all say it‚Äôs either my previous dependence on caffeine, or stress, or trauma, or all three. 

All I know is that it makes me perfect for night watch, and Bluewood needs night watchers. This journal was recommended by my therapist, maybe to tire me out or destress me. I‚Äôm not sure, maybe she‚Äôs just a hack and I'm writing this for no reason.  Guess only time will tell, so see you next time. 

June 12th:	
Bluewood is strange. Also hello, or whatever. I still don‚Äôt know how to write unless I just talk to this damn book. Guess it‚Äôs a surrogate for having someone to talk to‚Ä¶ God that sounds depressing when I write it out. I made my own breakfast today instead of eating another gas station sandwich. It wasn‚Äôt much better, and I still ended up stopping there for coffee before work. 

	I met the guy who does the morning shift in the cabin, tower, thing. It‚Äôs an old firewatch tower that we‚Äôve repurposed to be a ranger station, though I suppose it could still be a firewatch tower if I happen to see one and have to call it in. 

	Anyway, I met Tom, the day shift worker. He‚Äôs an okay guy, kinda chipper. I guess you‚Äôd have to be to work day, maybe it‚Äôs some kind of spiritual thing. My cynical a## is stuck with nights while human sunshine takes over in morning. Anyway, we got to talking a bit since I showed up early and he wasn't busy. Usually I'm not very talkative, but Tom‚Äôs energy got me yapping with him. Can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve seen him before, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to remember me if I did. 

	According to Tom, there used to be a cult around the Bluewood area. Or at least another watchman told him that, who also heard it from another watchman. Supposedly they just kinda wandered around the park a lot, wearing masks and spooking the guests. I think it‚Äôs just a story to scare new hires, y‚Äôknow like saying that someone saw bigfoot or the goatman out in the woods. Or maybe a hitchhiker disappeared before their eyes, or heard a voice that wasn't quite human. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs all just bullshit. Stuff to keep you awake and aware. 

	The tower‚Ä¶ cabin? The cabin tower is pretty nice. Rustic isn‚Äôt really my cup of tea, but it wears it really well. Everything is wooden,  no modern tech for miles. My phone is basically a brick out here, and my only contact is a small radio where I can report things to the other night watchers, or my supervisors. There‚Äôs a few trail cameras set up around various areas, and monitors for viewing them in the cabin tower. 

	Nothing really happened, I didn't even see a guest do something stupid, just meander around. But more than that all there was was silence. Make me kinda uneasy, but sure I‚Äôll get used to it. New place, new nerves, it‚Äôs a cyclical thing. I wrote my last journal entry while waiting for something to happen. I should get some books or something, maybe a radio for music?

	Guess I‚Äôll just have to see, talk to you next time. 

June 22nd:
	So, Bluewood might‚Äôve just gotten interesting. Also sorry for not writing, forgot to‚Ä¶ like alot

	I talked with Tom again, he‚Äôs pretty much the only human I‚Äôve spoken to the past few days, I don‚Äôt have much in the way of a social life if you couldn‚Äôt tell. Anyway, we talked about the weirdest things we‚Äôve seen on shifts. Tom‚Äôs were pretty average, usual drunk people doing stupid shit, or on a good day a streaker. I told him about how a few months ago I thought I saw a two headed deer. Tom thought I was bullshitting him, but said I was pretty convincing. Then he brought up another story, one another night shifter told him. Guy had worked here for maybe a week before quitting because of this, but Tom and I agree he probably was just a lunatic. He claimed one night, from the trail cam just above a small cave, he saw what looked like a dude with big hands climb out of the mouth, and run into the woods on all fours

	Tom said he tried to tell this dude it was probably just some camera trick, but apparently he was dedicated to his story. 

	The cave in question is called Broksman Cave, after this random guy who found it. It was a spelunking cave for a while, but they shut it down after too many people got stuck and died. According to Tom, the old night shifter said the big hand thing is what was killing people. But the whole thing about Broksman, at least from what I‚Äôve heard, is that it's basically all crawlspaces and dead ends.

	We concluded the conversation with an agreement that the old night shifter was a crackhead, and spelunking is stupid. Nothing interesting happened on my shift, just a few drunk college students throwing cans everywhere that I had to call in. Bluewood really needs to invest in better, less hoppable fences.

	I knew it was bull, but I kept thinking about that story of the thing that crawled out of Broksman. Something about it freaked me out a bit, maybe it was just me imagining seeing it for myself. It was enticing at the same time. Like, if I saw it I could regale Tom with how the monster was real. Or at the very least it would make staring at the same 8 trail cameras less ass numbingly boring. I don‚Äôt know, all I know is that I kept my eye on the cave‚Äôs mouth, just in case. 

	I think I‚Äôm gonna do just fine in Bluewood. Talk to you next time. 

June 24th:
	Woke up early today, but early for me is 12:30 in the morning. I went on a quick jog, it was awful. I haven‚Äôt jogged or much less run for years now, yet I still look like I could fall over in the wind. Maybe it‚Äôs just metabolism, or maybe I just don‚Äôt eat enough. Can‚Äôt think of the last time I had three meals in one day.

	I didn't see Tom before work, which made me a bit sad. Our quick convos before my shift are usually the best part of my day. Maybe I should ask if he‚Äôd be willing to exchange numbers. Though, with us working opposite shifts and the cabin tower having no signal, I probably shouldn‚Äôt bother. 

	I saw a buck today, probably‚Ä¶ 20 points? 18? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt hunt. It was big though, don‚Äôt see many big ones around here. Besides that, only another frat bro who threw up in a bush. Dickhead. 

	That‚Äôs all for now I guess, talk to you later. 


June 30th:
	I really need to be more consistent with these. My therapist thinks weekly entries should do fine, so I‚Äôll shoot for that. No promises though,  non-existent person I‚Äôm writing to. I still don‚Äôt think this will help my sleeping schedule. 

	I actually slept at night on my day off, and it was awful. I woke up at like, 4 am and couldn‚Äôt move, at all. I tried, I really did, but it's like my mind was disconnected from my body. I had to just lay there, seeing‚Ä¶ things. I swear I saw that two headed deer in my window, just staring at me. I tried speaking, yelling, anything. But it was like my jaw had been super glued shut. It took minutes for me to be able to sit up, and by then the deer was long gone.  My doctors said it was sleep paralysis, and I shouldn‚Äôt try to sleep at night again. Something about my condition making me more susceptible to it. 

	I saw Tom again, we talked but just very quickly. He actually suggested one of us get a wifi router set up in the cabin tower. I said it‚Äôd be a game of who‚Äôd want to pay for it first. Besides that, just a bit of nonchalant small talk. It was nice to see him again though. 

	I know you‚Äôre not gonna believe me, even though you‚Äôre an inanimate object, but this is the weirdest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. 

	I was looking at the trail cams, just trying not be bored out of my fucking skull, when one of them turned suddenly. It was like someone grabbed the band attaching it to the tree and spun it to the other side. I tried calling it in, but they said it was  probably ‚ÄúJust a raccoon‚Äù. I thought it was bullshit but moved on and just kept looking at the cameras.

	But at some point, it started turning back. I looked closer at it, and swore I saw‚Ä¶ fingers. Like, four fingers in the corner turning the camera. They were pale, almost paper like, with dirty nails barely visible on the end. It was maybe a few seconds, just enough to get an idea of what they could be but it freaked me the fuck out.

	Later, I went into the bathroom for‚Ä¶ bathroom things. As I was looking in the mirror, checking if my eye bags had gotten any larger, I noticed a small corner of paper behind the frame. I pulled it out, and it was a drawing. It was scribbled on notebook paper with a pencil, and showed a‚Ä¶ thing.

	It had a humanish body, but had much longer limbs. Like, too long. It had only four, long fingers on each hand, with a small thumb. Its head was either scribbled out or just shadowed, but I could just make out its eyes. They were just little white circles, staring me down. Underneath the doodle was just two words, written like scratchy, like someone was ultra pissed writing them. I could just barely make them out.

‚ÄúThe Rake.‚Äù

	I figured the old nightshifter made it, but it still put me on edge looking at it. I put it in my pocket and went back to work, but didn‚Äôt look at the Broksman camera for the entire night. I‚Äôm sure you could guess why. 

	It‚Äôs strange though. I‚Äôm scared more than I‚Äôve been at any other park, but I also feel‚Ä¶ like intrigued. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I just need sleep. That much is obvious. Talk at you again.

	
July 7th: 
I forgot about the drawing completely. Just emptied my work pockets and found it again. Think it‚Äôs time to go play detective. I‚Äôm going to ask Anna, my primary supervisor, who the old night watcher was. See you then. 


July 8th:
	Anna was‚Ä¶ helpful. Mostly

	I drove down to her office an hour before work, and by office I really mean cabin. The forest service office in Bluewood is just as rustic as its ranger stations. I am beginning to think the rangers don‚Äôt think of fire hazards very often. Maybe it‚Äôs intentional, and they‚Äôre just waiting for Bluewood to burn down so they can go to an actual national park. Too bad not many guests are arsonists. 

	Anyway, I asked to speak with Anna. When I got to her office, the face she gave me radiated the impression she thought this could‚Äôve just been an email. 

	When I asked about the previous night watchers in my cabin tower, she rolled her eyes, asked if ‚ÄúTom was still telling people that story?‚Äù

	I confirmed, explaining how I had found the picture behind the mirror. I placed it on her desk, sliding it over for her to see. She barely glanced at it, grumbling under her breath. She reached back into a box, where she pulled out maybe a dozen other similar pictures. 

	‚ÄúHe's been doing this for years.‚Äù she said, ‚Äúleaving them in the watchtower or mailing them to me. It‚Äôs been really pissing me off.‚Äù 

	Feeling like a royal moron, I took the drawing back and awkwardly apologized. 

	Before I left, she stopped me in the doorway. She took a long drag off her cigarette, she‚Äôd been smoking since before I got there, giving credence to my fire hazard theory. 

	‚ÄúGeorge Fredrick‚Äôs was crazy, not well in the head,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúHe was on a lot of different meds back then, maybe even taking something extra if you know what I mean. He had hallucinations a lot during his shifts, always ranting and raving about‚Ä¶ that thing.‚Äù

	She took another drag,, ‚ÄúBut, he‚Äôs not the first to see it. It‚Äôs kind of Bluewood's own cryptid, people‚Äôve been yammering about it for decades. Completely sane people mind you.‚Äù

	I sat back down as she continued, ‚ÄúNow I think it‚Äôs all bullshit, personally. But I‚Äôve seen a lot more night watchers leave than the day ones. Tom‚Äôs been working there for years, but everyone else quits within weeks. To be honest you‚Äôre one of the more persistent.‚Äù

	She put out her cigarette, before looking me in the eyes. 

	‚ÄúBut Linus, if you don‚Äôt want to stay up there, tell me, and in two weeks you‚Äôll be out. No questions, no nothing.‚Äù

	I thought about it, for only a moment though. I couldn‚Äôt, this was the job I was made for. Not only that, but this was the only interesting thing I‚Äôd heard or seen of in years. The idea of seeing a monster to break up the boring ass drunk people and average wildlife, I couldn‚Äôt pass that up. 

	I declined, but thanked her for her time. Then I went to work, where I‚Äôm now writing this. I don‚Äôt know if I made the right decision, only time will tell. 

	Till next time Noodle. 

July 16th: 
	I haven‚Äôt seen it for days, The Rake or whatever it really was. I‚Äôm beginning to think I was just crazy. Maybe it was just my brain coming up with something to entertain me, since there had been nothing remotely of interest lately. Brains can do that if you stare at the same thing long enough. It‚Äôs really easy to get so bored your brain will just show you a ghost if you think about it enough. And sure as shit I‚Äôm staring at the same thing down here, but I‚Äôm not seeing any ghosts. 

	Sleep hasn't gotten better. 7 years of this shit now, happy anniversary I guess. I requested an extra day off before my scheduled one. I‚Äôm gonna go try to forget, it‚Äôs the day I always do. 

	I wish you were here, life‚Äôs too damn dull without you. 

July 19th: 
	This might be the strangest thing I‚Äôve seen in forever, though I‚Äôve been saying that since I‚Äôve been working in Bluewood. 

	On my drive to the Tower, I saw a tree with giant scratches all over it. I had to pull over to get a closer look. It was covered in four deep cuts in a row, about as deep as a coin. They were all over, like something was clawing at it. Logic may have said bear or even crazy person with a knife, but something else in me disagreed. 

	Just as I was about to call the wrecked tree in, I heard something. I know by now you think I‚Äôm nuts, but I heard a loud ass noise. It was like a howl, or maybe a scream? Look, I don't even know how to describe it. It didn‚Äôt sound like an animal, or like a human. It was almost, like something in between, if that makes sense. Regardless. reported the tree and went to the cabin tower.

	I asked Tom about the sound, and he said he heard it too. He thought it could have been some weird kind of elk or deer. Apparently they can make howlish noises if they‚Äôre motivated enough. I agreed with him, mostly so he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy. Maybe he wouldn‚Äôt, but I'd prefer to keep the only friend I know. Need someone to talk to, or someone else atleast. I forget that you‚Äôre not her sometimes.  

	Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid, but I think you know what I think the noise was. 

July 20th:
	I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Maybe I am, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm panicking writing this, up here in the Cabin Tower. My hands are fucking shaking I swear, Jesus I need to calm down. 

	Okay, it was like 1am or something. I was looking at the cameras, looking for something, anything. It was driving me crazy. At some point I just kept staring at the Broksman camera. Looking for that stupid Rake thing. Then the camera went out. Like, it didn‚Äôt run out of batteries, it was broken. I didn‚Äôt see something hit it, but it would fucking tell me if it was running out of battery, it wouldn‚Äôt just shut down. It had to have been broken, right?

	 Before calling it in, and decided right then and there I had to go down there. I called in the broken camera, and told whoever else was night watching I was going down to Broksman. They were nonchalant, just telling me to bring the gun, a crappy little rifle used to keep wild animals away, along with bear spray. I packed it all up, sprinted down the tower. I just about tripped and ate shit on the last step. I kept running until I got to Broksman.

	I don‚Äôt know what I expected. I don‚Äôt know if I thought I‚Äôd find The Rake or whatever and put the mystery to rest, or if I was just so bored that a camera having a can thrown at it by the resident idiot was worth this effort. I don‚Äôt know, all I know is what I found. I got to the trail camera, and sure enough it was broken. It had been smashed by something, though I couldn't find a rock or branch or anything that could have done it. My heart raced, and all I could think of was going into the cave.

	Ignoring the stories of all the people who had died down  there, I crawled into Broksman. I didn‚Äôt go very deep down, but I found‚Ä¶ a skinned deer. Like, a full ass buck, skinned and gutted. Its blood was everywhere, pooling in the cracks and crevices of the cave. Its eyes were still open, just staring at me. I don‚Äôt know what could have done this, some sick prankster or dumb hunter or squatter, but I crawled my ass right back out of that hell hole.

	It had to be it, The Rake, it just had to. I‚Äôm writing this in the Cabin Tower, I‚Äôve just reported the deer. My heart feels like it will hop into my throat. I feel like I‚Äôm being watched, like it‚Äôs watching me. I can‚Äôt even look at the cameras, it‚Äôs too much right now. I‚Äôm just so goddamn scared.

August 3rd: 
	I got a few days off after‚Ä¶ the incident. Anna told me I‚Äôd get paid for them, but I wouldn‚Äôt care either way. So far there no one knows who killed that deer, or broke the trail cam. 

	I talked to Tom outside of work. It turns out we‚Äôve been going to the same laundromat for years, knew I recognized him from somewhere. He‚Äôs doing well, just proposed to his boyfriend of 6 years, Shaun. Good for him. 

	He did bring up something I hadn‚Äôt thought of while we spoke: The Rake probably got its name from its hands. Somehow I didn‚Äôt put that together, that it‚Äôs called The Rake because its hands are wide, and it has long fingers. Like a rake, for leaves and shit. For some reason I thought it was just a random name that sounded kinda spooky, but no it was named after the yard tool. Maybe I‚Äôm just stupid, I don‚Äôt know. 

	I‚Äôve been sleeping closer to night now. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uncomfortable. 7 years of day sleeping does that to you I guess. I‚Äôve had little to no paralysis, and it usually only lasts a minute or two. Maybe I should follow up with the doctor about this.

	The Rake is always in the back of my mind, just popping back up every now and then to steal me from normal thinking. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ so bizarre. Maybe, I should try and ignore it for a bit, it can‚Äôt be good for my brain. I‚Äôve only got a few more days off left, so I gotta start preparing to go back. Hopefully by then I‚Äôll be able to stop envisioning the damn thing in the cameras. 

Hopefully. Talk to you next time. 
	
August 8th: 
	I have never been as scared as last night. I swear, to whatever god looks down on us, I swear on your grave, that this happened. 

	I was asleep at night again, somehow. There were no pills, I was just tired for the first time in forever. I woke up again, paralyzed. I just sat calmly this time, waiting for it to finish. But I looked over at my window, and I saw it open. It wasn‚Äôt open when I looked, it had just finished opening when I turned my eyes.

	It was then, when I felt pressure on my bed. Like it was being climbed on. And when I looked at the foot, it was right fucking there. The Rake.

	I swear it was there, I saw and felt its weight on my mattress. Its skin was gray and stretched over its frame. I could see its spine from just looking at its back. It turned its head. It looked like a bleached skull, its teeth clearly visible along the sides of its head. It had no nose, just a triangular hole in the middle of its face. Its eyes were sunken, deep pits. The light from the window barely illuminated it. It looked at me, I could just barely see the white pinpoint reflections of its eye. Its neck cracked, I could hear its bones creaking as it climbed onto me. It pressed all its weight on me, lurching its head down to stare at me. It breathed sharply through its teeth, only its teeth. It just stared at me, right into my eyes, never blinking. 

	It stared into me. I could feel its giant hands on my shoulders, pinning me down. I swear I almost felt a drop of its saliva on my face as it just loomed over my frozen body. It spoke. Not out loud, but its voice rang in my head. There were many voices, speaking in tandem. It was young, it was old. It was a man, a woman, something in between, something beyond, all at once. But they all said the same thing.

	‚ÄúDon't be afraid.‚Äù

	It tilted its head to the side. I swear its eyes got brighter. 

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôve always been here.‚Äù

	Its voice rang in my mind like an echo, as I felt myself crying. There was a comfort to its voice, a dreadful comfort that brought tears to my eyes. My mind was just screaming, trying to move any part of my body or talk or anything. I could only squeeze my eyes shut, begging whoever was listening out there to make it stop.  I don‚Äôt know how long I was lying there, but after a moment, I opened my eyes, and it was gone. 

	I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt feel safe in my own goddamn apartment. Who do I even talk to about this? Where can I even go? This shit is actually insane. I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do. Who would? This is‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.

	I have to go back to the tower.

August 23rd: 
So, a lot of things have changed. I haven‚Äôt written in this for awhile, and this might be the last time. 

	First off, I went back to the watchtower. I was driving up when I heard police sirens, and when I got there, there were about 5 cars. I ran over to what happened, but only caught a glimpse of an older bearded man being thrown in the back of one of the cars. An officer asked me to back away from the cars, and I wasn‚Äôt looking to be arrested.

	I looked over at the cabin tower, and saw Tom with another cop being interviewed. They never asked me anything, at least not that day. I went over to Tom when all the police left, and before he left I asked what had happened. 

	Apparently the old night watcher, George Fredrick‚Äôs, had been sneaking into the cabin tower for months. He was leaving various images, and even making random noises at night. He had been doing this to scare away the new workers, real Scooby Doo shit. He was never spotted because he knew exactly where the trail cameras were. Learned later on he was also the one who had skinned the deer in Broksman, and he was addicted to a lotta illegal bath salts and stuff.

	After the investigation, I tried getting back to night shifting, but found myself almost collapsing in exhaustion during my shifts. Somehow, my sleeping had actually gone back to normal. I don‚Äôt know if it was the journal or not. Maybe it was‚Ä¶ nah. 

	I ended up giving Anna my two weeks notice, she seemed to understand. I‚Äôm gonna stop writing in this journal after a while, if not right after this. It was‚Ä¶nice. It was like getting to talk to her again. She was always such a good listener. 

	I miss you, Jen. 

	Now, I checked with my doctors, they said that seeing‚Ä¶ you know what, was just a really bad case of sleep paralysis. My imagination and obsession had manifested in my dreams, and when you have sleep paralysis you often dream with your eyes open. So it was really no wonder I saw that damn thing. 

	I‚Äôm moving out of the Bluewood area tonight, just finished up my last night shift, hopefully ever. I asked Tom if he‚Äôd be willing to talk outside of work, to keep me sane (didn‚Äôt say that part). We‚Äôve been chatting on and off for a week now, he and his fiance even met up for lunch one day. They‚Äôre good people. 

You‚Äôd think after all this I wouldn‚Äôt believe in any kind of monster thing living in the woods. After all, it was just the insane former night watcher and my overactive imagination. But a part of me still isn‚Äôt sure. Anna said people had been seeing it for years, long before George was working or even born. The myth is as old as the cave, as the Bluewood area.

1oa2vf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1oa2vf1/smallgroup_cotswolds_tour_prices/,Small-Group Cotswolds Tour prices?,"I recently took this incredible day trip from London to the Cotswolds, and I need to share my experience because it was honestly one of the best tours I've done in England. If you're thinking about exploring beyond London, this is absolutely worth considering.

The tour costs $122.19 per person, which I found really reasonable considering everything that's included - transportation, lunch, and a knowledgeable guide. You can book it easily here: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds 

What really stood out was how intimate the experience felt. Our group was small (maximum 16 people), which meant we could actually hear our guide's stories and ask questions without feeling like we were part of a tourist herd. Our guide, Christian, was fantastic - he knew every hidden corner and shared fascinating historical details about each village.

The itinerary is well-planned. We visited four main villages:
- Burford: The gateway to the Cotswolds with its charming high street
- Bibury: Often called England's prettiest village (and it really is!)
- Bourton-on-the-Water: Where we had a delicious lunch
- Stow-on-the-Wold: A beautiful market town with interesting Lord of the Rings connections

The tour leaves from South Kensington at 8:25 AM and returns about 9.5 hours later. I loved that they offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, so there's no risk if your plans change. You can also reserve now and pay later, which is super convenient.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes - you'll want to explore every corner
- Bring a camera - these villages are incredibly photogenic
- Arrive by 8:15 AM to check in at the meeting point
- The meeting spot (Urban Baristas) has great coffee to start your day

The air-conditioned vehicle was comfortable for the journey, and our driver made sure we avoided the worst traffic. We got plenty of time at each stop - not feeling rushed was a huge plus.

If you're considering this tour, I'd recommend booking in advance. It's quite popular (I noticed it gets booked about 2 months ahead on average) and has a 97% recommendation rate from travelers. The reviews aren't lying - it really is that good.

For anyone worried about accessibility, note that while the tour is stroller-friendly, it's not wheelchair accessible, and children under seven aren't permitted. Also, if you have any serious medical conditions, you might want to check with your doctor first.

I've done several day trips from London, but this Cotswolds tour stands out for its value, organization, and the sheer beauty of the locations. If you want to experience the quintessential English countryside without the hassle of planning it yourself, this is your best bet. You can check availability and book here: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds

Just remember to book ahead - these small group tours fill up quickly, especially during peak season. Trust me, experiencing these charming villages with a knowledgeable guide makes all the difference.",1,1760811075.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm planning a 10-day trip to Brazil in March and flying direct from Toronto. I‚Äôve read a lot of people say to just stick with Rio, but I feel like 10 days might be a bit long to stay in one city.

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old single male and my favorite things when traveling are grabbing a good coffee and pastry in the morning, golfing if possible, and checking out nice restaurants with a good vibe. I also love open-air nightlife where I can get a table, smoke a cigar, and enjoy good company and music.

Right now I‚Äôm thinking:
	‚Ä¢	Rio: Stay in Copacabana or Ipanema
	‚Ä¢	Sao Paulo: Stay in Vila Madalena

Would it make more sense to do 10 days in Rio (maybe split between two neighborhoods) or do 4 nights in Sao Paulo and 6 nights in Rio?

1oa2tso,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/1oa2tso/4_years_into_retirement/,4 years Into Retirement,"I'm 60 and my wife is 55. I always had an idea of what retirement was going to be like. Here is my personal insights after four years.
The 1st year felt like an extended vacation, with travel, buying things, attending concerts and sporting events. Time flew.

The 2nd year slowed a bit with some travel, going out to local fine dining and several concerts and some games. My days became more routine oriented and the focus became on our house. New furniture,  upgrades, etc. My wife and I were not accustom to spending 24hrs a day with each other. We have different interests, although many are similar. She got restless and bored. She took a full time job (which she loves) to absorb some time. I didn't realize how exhausting traveling so much could be. At 60 I'd find myself wanting to be home more. Crowds, standing in lines, and hotels became less appealing.

The 3rd year slowed down a bit more,  with both of us in more structured routines. She'd go to work and I would putter around during the day. I found myself drinking coffee in the mornings on my patio watching the birds at my bird feeder. As an ex jock, I never in a thousand years pictured myself doing that...lol. Watching the market on TV for a few, going out to lunch and a few days a week heading to a local dive bar for a few drinks. My wife and I would go out at least one weekend day together.

The 4th year I have noticed we have both changed. We both have little tolerance for large crowds, driving on freeways or staying out late. We enjoy eating at home more often, and my wife is now just working part time. I enjoy my sports and mowing my own lawn and tending to our property.

People larp on here about hobbies,going to the gym, and plenty of banal first world problems. I'm not down playing health or hobbies, just giving an honest representation of 4 years. We do regret living some distance from our three grown children and two grandchildren. There sure seems to be a lot of free hours in the day now. Thank God we have them! We are so fortunate.

Spathodea: Yoohoo! I ran as fast as I could after today's training, aswell as training Narita Taishin too!

Spathodea: I believe she's on her way here aswell- Wait.. 

**Go to the second slide**

Spathodea: Where's Asaru? Did I come too late? Or is it too early, *checks the clock* no I'm right on time! 

Asaru: *pants* I'm here! Gosh that took way too long.. Sorry for being late!

Spathodea: It's okay! It didn't take you that long though!

Asaru: thanks a lot! *sets up equipment* So let's start the interview shall we?

** Go to Slide Three**

Asaru: Alright Alright! this is Episode 2 of The Daily Interviews, Today our Interviewee is a renowed Boxer  known as Spathodea! 

Spathodea: Yoohoo! Its certainly a lovely day isn't it! I could go for a walk right now!

Asaru: You're certainly very energetic, but I agree! The suns shining pretty well just like yesterday! So let's change the pace compared to the last interview. How's your time at Tracen?

Spathodea: Mmm, I've became Narita Taishin's Trainer recently! Also, I'm planning to-

Asaru: Oh yeah! Werent you planning to open up a Boxing Gym of sorts near Tracen Academy? Personally I think that's interesting! TracenFall will definently- *I just interrupted you did I?*

Spathodea: Yeah. That's Right!

Asaru: Oh apologies, I got way too ahead of myself there. I'm just interested in your endeavours, that is how an interviewer is supposed to act right?

Spathodea: That's Right!.. It is a pretty good trait! Nice Tactic*

**Go to Slide Four**

Asaru: Anyways like I was saying, you do like sweets and desert right? Soo..

Spathodea: I know a professional boxer should say no to those things but.. I just sometimes cant control myself!

Asaru: right.. So I have a bar of pretty good chocolate over here! But I've also known that your grades in highschool are.. Lacking to say the least. *grabs report card records from her highschool*

**Go to Slide Five**

Spathodea: W-Whats that your holding? Records on my school, about my report cards?! Aaaah! Stop reading!

Asaru: Calm down, I've also had some bad grades so this can't be that.. *baad*..

**Go to Slide 6**

Spathodea: ... Asaru?

Asaru: Uh. Oh yeah! Back to what I was saying, to help you a little bit. I'll give you questions from your most recent exams and you have to answer atleast 50‚ÑÖ of them right, if you do. I'll give you this entire bar of chocolate. 

Spathodea: .Sure! It's time to go all out!

*An hour passes as Spathodea passes her answers*

Asaru: sure took your time to answer 15 questions. Now let's see here, I'm pretty sure you've trial and error'd your way through.. School.. *how's it even worse..*

**Go to Slide 7**

Spathodea: So, how's my score! Is it any higher than before? 

Asaru: You've gotten.. Actually we shouldn't say that on camera, *it was a 5/15* but you should have the slice of cake for your great work! Nice job!

Spathodea: Thanks!.. Wow, this is pretty great chocolate, I've never had chocolates like this! Not the best I've had though.. But can I have one more?

Asaru: Is that really healthy for your boxing career? I think we should settle off that actually.

Spathodea: Come on! Just one more!

Asaru: Fine.. I don't really eat a lot of sweets cause my tastebuds can't handle those very well. So I don't enjoy them much either..

Spathodea: You're missing out on alot! Its unfortunate that you can't eat any desserts or sweets!

Asaru: well it's fine, I can keep my body in perfect shape for Archery!

Spathodea: Aren't you a little bit malnutritioned?

Asaru: Well.. We should switch the topic! *but yeah, extremely. *.. Soo I've heard you have a couple friends back at The Uluru Games! I'm not a huge fan of those but it is something to note.

Spathodea: you mean Desert Flannel right?  Shes literally over there!

**Go to slide 8**

Desert Flannel: Hello Spathodea and I suppose, Asaru. Plappy is greeting you! Press the button to greet her back!

Asaru: *Plappy seems to be some sort of Tamagotchi from the times I was younger.. But different?* I see, Hello Plappy!

Spathodea: Hello Desert Flannel and Plappy! Nice to see you guys again.

Asaru: Are the two of you (CC: Desert Flannel and Plappy) planning to stay here in Tracen?

Desert Flannel: We've yet to decide, this place is neither chaotic nor hateful. Props to the people working here. 

Asaru: Exactly! Ever since some changes here, Tracen has been working at full capacity without much dangers except for some sewer monsters I've been hearing about lately.

Spathodea: there's sewer monsters?

Asaru: yeah, Though it's in a different section so we (CC: TracenFall) are not obliged to assist or else we might get sued for any damages that occurs there..

Desert Flannel: I see, all those work has to do something towards your body. And I've heard youve haven't been sleeping nor eating much have you? You deserve Employee of the year, well since you are the boss.. No, Employer of the year!

Spathodea: Actually, since there's quite a lot of us. I've have another person I need to add here!

Asaru: and who is it?

Spathodea: Its my Trainee! Narita Taishin

Asaru: I-I uh.. I uh... Who? Wh-what?  Did you say Taishin? Is going here???

*Readers Context: Asaru is a DieHard Narita Taishin Fan ever since she was seven. And this is the first time she will interact with her.*

Narita Taishin: Hello Spathodea, I think Desert Flannel. And-

Asaru: NARITA TAISHIN!!! NO WAY! IVE BEEN WATCHING YOU SINCE YOU JOINED UMADDIT! I-I COULD- Woo, I feel light-heade-

**Go to Slide 9**

Spathodea: Asaru? ASARU! She fainted!

Narita Taishin: Its way too loud here. I'll get out to not ruin the mood.

Spathodea: Taishin wait!-

*COMMERCIAL BREAK*

???: Has your head ever hurt? Then buy some Ibuprofen!

Ragebait Goblin: YOU BE WHAT?

Asaru: it helped me sleep that one time. So it works.

???: Side Effects are: Death, Double Death, Triple Death, 30 types of hepatisis, Hallucinations, Ether Corruption, Forced Storm Braving.

*WE'RE BACK*

**Go to Slide 11**

Asaru: Wh-What happened? Where's Taishin!

Spathodea: it took us 30 minutes for you to wake up! And taishin left..

Asaru: ... Oh.. Well, it's Alright then. I can just, cry in a corner after this interview! Yeah... 

Desert Flannel: It was quite the show! We couldn't record it but the viewers at TracenFall will definently make this into something huh..

Asaru: that really made me hungry.. Like a lot..

Desert Flannel: alright, so what should I get you? Coffee? Pancakes? Eggs, or Bacon? People are ready in the kitchen now.. Wait, am I supposed to deliver the milk today? Shoot! 

**Go to Slide 12**

Spathodea: Well bye Desert Flannel!

Asaru: I still feel so embarrassed, but now we're one to one so we can speak freely huh!

Spathodea: that's right! So what do you want to talk about?

Asaru: well, I want to know how you've gotten so interested in Boxing!

**Go to Slide 13**

Spathodea: My mother and my trainer were the people who really supported me throughout my journey, and my mother was the one to give me my first pair of Boxing Gloves too!

Asaru: Cool! I mean me and my mom aren't too big together, but she taught me some [Archery](https://www.reddit.com/u/Asaru-Of-TracenFall/s/gAtiavodxx) which caused me to do some contests! 

Spathodea: I bet you and your mother had some good moments if she herself taught you archery

Asaru: well no, she kinda left me after my brother got too sick and they went AWOL, causing me to pay for all the billings at a very young age so I was forced to enter those concerts to win.

Spathodea: well, maybe that wasnt really what I was thinking but well, atleast you learnt something from her right?

Asaru: that is true! I did make some enemies back at the contests but its all in the past. Have you made any?

Spathodea: well, if there someone I'd jump at first sight. It'd probably be Ezra! And

Asaru/Spathodea: They do say/And if you say: ""If you hate eachother's you love eachothers"", Spathodea: Then I will make you and Narita Taishin's punching bag!

Spathodea: what were you saying?

Asaru: I mean. I wasn't saying anything! Trust!

**Go to Dlide

Spathodea: ookay. So it seems like I'll have to go soon so we have our final questions?

Asaru: ooh boy do I have a question.. Spathodea have you been interested in someone lately? Like someone you want to know more about?

Spathodea: Well, the tall man with a bat working in Limbus Company does catch my eye, he could help with Taishin's training... And, I feel some sort of special connection that pulls me towards him.. Is that-

Asaru: I think that might just be Younger Love Spathodea.. I'd know that!

Spathodea: I'm definently out of his league.. Maybe acting as a sibling figure would probably be best for me..

Asaru: Well you should take any chances! You can only have so much until they're gone. *I've personally experienced that myself..* but, whatever you want! Relationships are great if both parties likes it! 

Spathodea: I mean I'm still a teen! There's no way he'd look into my direction- wait is the recorder still on?!

Asaru: well.. Yeah?

Spathodea: *Blushing* C-Cut It Now!

**Go to the Final Slide**

Asaru: Hehe- Wait my cameras gonna brea-

I‚Äôm trying to understand why everyone is so upset with how Salman handled the situation. After watching the episode, I have a few points to share ‚Äî I feel people here are judging without looking at the full picture. Let me explain some of the common points people are bringing up after today‚Äôs Weekend Ka Vaar.

**1. ‚ÄúSalman was drunk / slow / not interested in today‚Äôs WKV.‚Äù**

Guys, it‚Äôs Diwali time! Being a celebrity, Salman must have had hundreds of invites from powerful and important people. But still, he came for his work commitment to host the show. **He‚Äôs almost 60 now** ‚Äî obviously he looked tired and sleepy. He even asked for coffee and a chair to relax.  
But people started saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs drunk‚Äù etc. Even if he *was* (which we don‚Äôt know), what‚Äôs the problem? Did he misbehave with anyone? Drinking is not a crime ‚Äî misbehaving after drinking is. And he didn‚Äôt do that. So why create unnecessary drama?

**2. ‚ÄúBB makers and Salman brought Dabboo to whitewash Amaal‚Äôs image.‚Äù**

First of all, live feeds are delayed by one day. If BB makers really wanted to show Amaal in a good light, they wouldn‚Äôt have shown his negative moments at all. But they did ‚Äî so clearly they‚Äôre not hiding anything.  
Now about Salman ‚Äî he has already scolded Amaal many times on WKV. But Amaal keeps behaving the same way. At this point, Salman is a 60-year-old man; he can‚Äôt keep shouting like a young guy, ‚ÄúAau kya apni aukaat pe?‚Äù etc. It won‚Äôt look good or respectful.  
When someone doesn‚Äôt listen even after being told repeatedly, what else can be done? Sometimes only parents can handle it better, so Dabboo was called. Salman even told Dabboo that Amaal‚Äôs actions were wrong and not something to be proud of.  
So where‚Äôs the whitewash? He clearly said it was wrong and unacceptable. What more do people expect him to say?

**3. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong that all the drama happened during Diwali week.‚Äù**

Diwali is a festival of happiness and positivity. No one wants to see fights and negativity on such a day. Salman also can‚Äôt keep teaching and shouting at everyone every week ‚Äî that gets boring too.  
He had to maintain a balance between keeping the festive mood and addressing the issues. So he chose a middle ground ‚Äî handled things calmly without spoiling the Diwali vibe.

**4.** Actually, he spoke about every major fight of the week. Malti‚Äôs actions were wrong ‚Äî no doubt. Then came Farhana‚Äôs racist comment on Neelam ‚Äî that was also serious. Then Amaal snatched Farhana‚Äôs food ‚Äî again wrong.  
Each person was called out properly. You can‚Äôt compare who did worse ‚Äî all were corrected in a fair way, and still the Diwali spirit of the episode was maintained.

In short ‚Äî people are overreacting a bit. Salman did his job, addressed everything, and kept the Diwali vibe alive. Not every episode needs to be full of yelling and drama.",0,1760810691.0,biggboss,6,0.44,False

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can help me figure out some strange medication behaviour (of course I will talk to my psychiatrist but I won‚Äôt be seeing her for another couple weeks). I am on 40mg of Vyvanse for ADHD and I recently started taking 50mg Luvox for OCD. It‚Äôs worked amazingly well. The problem is it‚Äôs supposed to be sedating so I was told to take it at night. It has the opposite effect and I‚Äôve been up until 3am. It‚Äôs supposed to have a strong interaction with caffeine so I cut down to one cup of 1/2 caff in the morning, but it didn‚Äôt help. The last two days I‚Äôve taken it in the morning with my Vyvanse and coffee and I was so tired yesterday I needed to take a nap. Seems like today will be the same. 


Luvox increases the half life of caffeine but I can‚Äôt quite make sense of this‚Ä¶ sometimes caffeine and Vyvanse will make me sleepy, sometimes they don‚Äôt, I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out what changes things. So now I‚Äôm wondering what is happening with the Luvox and if there‚Äôs a way I could ‚Äòhack‚Äô this so sleep at night?? You guys seem to know a lot of things that no one ever tells me, like don‚Äôt take vyvanse and vitamin C together, maybe someone has had the same experience???? ",1,1760810302.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Things got boring. The spark died. My ex reached out on social media and we started talking. Just talking at first. Then he said he missed me. That he'd made a mistake letting me go. That I deserved to feel alive again.

I started thinking maybe I'd settled too fast. Maybe I never got closure. Maybe I owed it to myself to see what could have been.

So I sat my husband down one night and said, ""I need some time apart. I need to figure out who I am outside of this marriage.""

He looked at me like I'd slapped him. ""What does that mean?""

""It means I need space. Two weeks. Maybe stay with my parents. I just need to breathe.""

""Are you seeing someone else?""

""No. God, why does it always have to be about someone else? This is about me.""

He stared at me for a long time. Then he said okay. He said he'd give me the space I needed. He packed a bag that night and left.

I texted my ex the second the door closed.

Those two weeks were amazing. We stayed at his place. We went to the beach. We had long talks about our future. He said he wanted to marry me. That he'd grown up since we dated. That this time would be different.

But something felt off. He kept borrowing money for dinner. His apartment was a mess. He talked about his band ""taking off"" even though they practiced in his garage and had like forty followers.

By week two, reality set in. This wasn't some romantic reunion. This was a 34-year-old man who still lived like he was 22.

I started missing my husband. The way he made coffee every morning. How he'd rub my feet while we watched TV. The stability. The actual adult life we'd built.

I texted him. ""Can we talk?""

No response.

I called. Straight to voicemail.

I drove home on day fourteen. I had this whole speech planned. How I'd made a mistake. How I chose him. How we could work through this.

The house was empty.

Not like he stepped out empty. Empty empty. His clothes were gone. His books. His gaming setup. The photos of us were gone from the walls. There were clean squares on the paint where they used to hang.

I called him twenty times. Finally he answered.

""Where are you?""

""I moved out.""

""What do you mean you moved out? I said I needed two weeks.""

""You got your two weeks. And I got clarity.""

""Clarity about what?""

""About the fact that my wife asked for space to go fuck her ex and thought I'd just wait around like an idiot.""

My stomach dropped. ""How did you...""

""Your location was still shared on your phone. You weren't at your parents'. You were at his apartment. For two weeks straight.""

I couldn't speak.

""I filed for divorce yesterday. You'll get the papers next week.""

""You can't just give up on us like this.""

He laughed. Actually laughed. ""I'm not the one who gave up. You did that when you lied to my face and ran to another man.""

""It was a mistake. I came back. I chose you.""

""No, you came back because it didn't work out with him. That's not the same thing.""

""So you're just going to throw away six years?""

""You already did that. I'm just accepting it.""

He hung up.

I called my mom crying. Told her everything. She said I was an idiot. My dad won't even talk to me. My sister said I got what I deserved.

His family blocked me on everything. Our mutual friends picked sides. They all picked his.

I'm staying with a coworker now because I can't afford our old place alone. He kept making payments on his half until the lease ends, but he won't respond to any of my messages.

I saw on social media that he's already seeing someone new. It's been three months. Three months and he's moved on completely while I'm still trying to figure out how everything fell apart so fast.

Everyone keeps saying I cheated. But we were on a break. I was honest that I needed space. It's not my fault he couldn't handle two weeks apart.

**Was I really supposed to know he'd just leave forever?**

1oa29he,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oa29he/my_manager_cried_to_me_about_how_unhappy_he_is/,My manager cried to me about how unhappy he is with his wife and child with autism and I slept with him,"# 

I 30F am Slovenian and worked (As support) for a big company with big production plant in Austria. And this guy 46M , was the leader, the top manager there. Big coincidence but he was also Sl0venian. And he was upset and angry with us for taking his people jobs.

So he was the top guy, around 400 people under him. He had a reputation for being intelligent but harsh, intimidating, and impossible to please. But took decisions under pressure in a very short time and I wanted his respect and validation. He never even heard of me.

We had only one interaction - over a year ago. There was a scheduling issue, and I had to call him. I thought that sharing the same langauge and all that will make it better and more personal...

He didn‚Äôt know who I was and immediately started shouting, saying our work was a disaster and that I didn‚Äôt understand anything. We took their jobs and we are now ruining the company. It almost made me cry. he said he doesn't care its not my fault, he wants it fixed. That its not an option I talk to my manager as I suggested, but I have to, its mandatory. He asked me if I can do simple things and do something together here and now, with him. Something really simple and open a file. I asked him to be polite to me. He said he is and I said: you are raising your voice at me. he said yes, because he is angry.

I reported him after that call. It was handled by headquarters, and we never spoke again but he had to explain his behaviour towards me

A year later, I moved to Austria with the same company, so where he is the leader. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to ever run into him again. But a few weeks ago, I saw him at a bar. I said hello, he didn't know who I am. I said hello because I was looking at him and I felt it was awkward. I told him who I am and he said: ah you that woman who reprted me.

He offered me a drink and then another, but we stayed sober mostly. We talked a lot more than I expected. He told me things I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever hear from someone like him. He cried and said he‚Äôs married but unhappy. That he married his wife because it seemed like the practical thing to do at the time but he doesn't get along well with her. said the woman he truly loved got married to someone else. He has two kids, one with autism, and he feels stuck, angry, and tired all the time.

That night, something happened between us that shouldn‚Äôt have( i don't know what I am allowed to say, but you get what I mean). He was very r... ough with me. His wife was at her parents.

The next morning, at the office, everything was different. He avoided me completely. He canceled a meeting where he was supposed to be present, even though it was part of his responsibilities. He didn‚Äôt look at me once when we bumped into each other at the plant coffee shop

I don‚Äôt know what to think. I can‚Äôt tell if it meant anything to him or if he just needed an escape for a night. I‚Äôm not proud of what happened.",0,1760809676.0,Marriage,4,0.29,False

Me: 35M

Her: 32F, diagnosed BP since she was ~13/14

We met on Tinder in March, after she got out of a relationship, we started talking as friends, got to know each other, got closer, in May she said she was ready to date again, I asked her out, we went pedal to the medal very fast over the next 3 months. We lovebombed each other. We talked about getting married and our future together, I even ended up buying a ring, we made plans, and everything. I was at her house with her family virtually every day, she met my family when we flew out back to my home, we had trips together. I loved who she was. I didn‚Äôt see her as a diagnosis, but I wanted to learn and understand more of it, to keep loving her better. I didn‚Äôt see her as a statistic. I fell in love with *her*. 

One of the really big things I‚Äôm grateful for, is that being with her and interacting with her family, brought me back around to my faith. I had been turned away from the church for the last 20-25 years. In the last few weeks of the relationship, I started looking into religion more, and since the breakup I‚Äôve been deep back into the Catholic faith I was raised in. I‚Äôm back in Mass, signed up for Bible Study, got myself a rosary and a crucifix. There was a period of time where I was worried if it was all performative, like, ‚Äúoh well she‚Äôs religious and wants to convert to Catholicism so if i get back into it, then that‚Äôll just line up perfectly‚Äù. But now, as I‚Äôm typing this, I feel secure and grounded in my renewed faith. 

2 months ago, she started talking about breakup thoughts she was having. She was starting to think she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, and had things she needed to work on within herself. We tried talking and working it out but they kept coming up. She broke up with me a month ago. Said she just was not ready to be in a relationship and she‚Äôs so sorry she hurt me. What she felt for me was real, but she did not mean for the relationship to end up the way it did. 

Well, I messed up this week, and I sent her mom a text. My intention with the text was to just thank her mom for allowing me into their home. I also wanted to ask her mom for some wisdom , I guess in so many words, I wanted to check on my ex, to see where she was emotionally, because I ultimately would‚Äôve loved to reach back out maybe to be friends 

A couple days went by and my ex reached out. Said she and her mom talked about the text, and my ex thought it‚Äôd be best if we met up for coffee to talk. 

We met up last night. She said she read the text I sent to her mom and thought it was very kind and sweet, She thought I was trying to get back together. I told her no. Even in my grief, I‚Äôve known that she and I were not ready to be in a relationship as we were. I‚Äôve never had a chance to tell her, though, that my wish would be for us to come together, figure out what we need together, and work on things together. 

She told me she did not want me to hold onto any hope that she and I could get back together. She said she‚Äôs very happy being single right now. Said it‚Äôs opening up so much clarity for her. Said she‚Äôs really focusing on staying single and figuring out who she is, and what she wants. She‚Äôs said she needs to just spend a long long time single, to focus on herself and getting closer with God. 

She said we probably wouldn‚Äôt have worked out anyway, because of some ‚Äúfundamental personality differences‚Äù, and when she listed them, they were things that (A) I‚Äôve been aware of for years, and (B) I had already begun working on before the breakup. I didn‚Äôt tell her last night everything I had been working on. 

I didn‚Äôt push back at all. Now, in hindsight, I wish I could‚Äôve. But that‚Äôs probably the pain talking. 

She said she feels like she made a mistake by going on Tinder in the first place, back in March, because she probably wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship back then. But she met me. And we hit it off. 

She said that in the heat of the relationship , she was certain she had met her husband. But then, I don‚Äôt know, she realized that none of this is what she wanted. 

She also said, last night, that she does not see us returning to being friends anytime soon. Not that the door is closed forever, just not on her radar right now. She says there‚Äôs too much tied up. But then she also said if down the line, I wanted to meet up again for coffee or something, she‚Äôd be down. 

I‚Äôm absolutely torn up. I was lucid the entire time and I knew I wanted to marry her. She‚Äôs kept saying this entire time that it‚Äôs nothing to do with me, I‚Äôm a great guy, she holds so many compliments on me, she fell in love with the ways I loved her but she just couldn‚Äôt fall in love with me. She said that when she thinks of me being hurt by the breakup, she hurts for me, but she is not hurt by the breakup. 

I‚Äôm just trying to make sense of this all. I can‚Äôt let her go. I know I‚Äôm still raw and fresh in the hurt so I probably haven‚Äôt given myself enough amount of time. I regret texting her mom. 

One of the things I‚Äôve been actively trying to work on, is relinquishing control, and trusting that God has something better lined up for me. I‚Äôve just been so used to living in fear, when I was away from God, that no one had my back so I had to have my own back. So I became obsessed with controlling every little detail of my life, and it became very apparent in my relationships, especially in this one, and especially in this breakup. If I just say this, if I just do that, maybe this is a BP discard and she‚Äôll regret this whole thing in a couple weeks to a couple months and come back and be incredibly sorry, maybe she doesn‚Äôt really mean this breakup and her nervous system just got mad triggered and she just needs to come down, maybe this, maybe that 

In this very early stage of my grief, I can‚Äôt yet let go that we are meant to be. I know I‚Äôm hurting and in serious pain, and all I want is just to be physically seen by someone, and just to break down in tears with someone. 

Please help. I‚Äôm an anxious mess today. My leg hasn‚Äôt stopped bouncing since I woke up in a panic at 4:30am. Which is the exact time I‚Äôve been waking up all week, regardless of when I go to bed. ",1,1760809456.0,BipolarSOs,1,1.0,False

1oa25zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1oa25zf/i_think_i_got_the_evil_eye_after_sharing_news_of/,I think I got the evil eye after sharing news of my engagement,"Assalamu alaikum everyone,

I hope this is an appropriate subreddit. Since I got engaged, my health has been declining and at first I thought it was a coincidence but now I don't think so. I'm looking for advice on how to go about doing ruqya (or getting it done on me by someone with more Islamic knowledge) and fixing my relationship with Allah swt so that my engagement (and my future marriage, inshaAllah) can improve. I'm a revert and I didn't know about the seriousness of the evil eye before this happened to me, so please go easy on me.

I got engaged in mid September and I thought I was being careful by only sharing the news on my close friends story (in Western culture, people usually publicize it widely) but I think someone gave me the evil eye anyway. My health was great beforehand. I had a little fatigue but I was able to manage it with coffee. I was going to the gym once or even twice a day and I had the energy to study all day long. My interactions with my fianc√© were overwhelmingly positive. After the engagement, I started losing energy and motivation and it got worse by the week. I no longer have the energy to go to the gym, I can barely focus on my studies or attend class, and I've been falling behind on my prayers because I feel so physically weak. I sleep for 12 hours and I still don't feel rested. On 9 hours of sleep or less, it feels like I didn't sleep at all. All I can think about during the day is how badly I want to sleep. I haven't been a very good fianc√© because I'm struggling to initiate conversation throughout the day and keep a positive disposition. Every waking hour is a battle between me and my obligations. At this rate, if things continue to worsen, I don't know if I'm going to be able to graduate, hold down a job, or get married. I don't want to be a burden on my spouse and I know it is my responsibility to get better, so that's why I'm here.

I got diagnosed with low ferritin about 2 weeks ago (the count was 11; a normal value must be above 16 and most people need a count of 50 to feel well) and I've been following my doctor's advice to a T by taking iron supplements twice daily. My declining health has driven a wedge between me and my fianc√©, especially before I got my lab results back. At one point, he didn't know if he could emotionally handle it anymore because I kept getting worse and he couldn't do anything to help - all he could do was watch. I can't imagine how powerless he must feel. Since I got the results back, things have gotten a bit better between us because it seems to be an easily treatable condition, alhamdulillah. But I don't feel better after supplementing - in fact, my fatigue and weakness has been worsening. I have another appointment scheduled soon and I'm going to ask about infusions or changing the dosing schedule. I've also been taking vitamin D and multivitamins and trying to get 10,000 steps in so that I remain at least a little active.

I can tell my struge to pray isn't laziness or low iman because I still feel a desire to gain Islamic knowledge, I want to pray more and I even pray in my dreams, and I remember Allah throughout the day. I have love for Allah in my heart but I know that without regular salah, it isn't enough. Lately I've been praying in a chair because I don't have the strength to pray standing up (I get dizzy when I try and I struggle to pray multiple consecutive prayers standing because it takes so much energy out of me). I rinse myself once during wudu rather than three times. I try to make prayer as uncomplicated as possible for myself but I'm still struggling, especially during the day when my fatigue is at its worst. I know there's no excuse for missing my salah and that it's fard, but I truly am trying so hard to pray every day. Side note: if anyone knows of other allowances that make prayer or wudu easier for people who are ill, please feel free to let me know because I feel remorseful every time I miss a prayer and I really want to do better.

My main question is, how do I know if I'm experiencing the evil eye and what can I do about it? Should I go to my local mosque and ask the imam for help? I'm still somewhat new to the Muslim community so I don't know what steps I should be taking or who I should talk to.

Thank you so much for reading this far. May Allah bless you all with good health and a happy marriage.",1,1760809446.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False
1oa2587,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexington/comments/1oa2587/community_advetising_spots_where_posters_are/,Community Advetising Spots where posters are allowed,"Hi Lexington community. Long time resident here with a quick question for those who know the rules of our community spaces better than I. My wife and I are trying to start a small side business related to to teaching a specific skill (language related), not trying to become major just trying to find a few clients beyond our personal connections. 

Only being vague here because I don't want people to think I am advertising and won't share any more info in the comments about business name or contact info.

We have OKed putting up flyers at a few stores related to this where we are regulars, but I was wondering what other places might be OK with this kind of advertising for a community small business (if you can even call it that). We will never really make enough money to advertise commercially outside of Facebook at best.

Does anyone know if some of the coffee shops or other community type spaces might be OK with flyers like this from a random city resident? I am guessing library and UK are out because even though they are perfect for our target market, they probably only allow community and local govt stuff, not commercial.

Thanks in advance

1oa24z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1oa24z6/constipation_may_not_have_a_one_solution_for_all/,Constipation may not have a one solution for all,"am going to throw out several thoughts. what is helpful for one, might not be the answer for all. First, our intestines have good (and bad) bacteria. Kimchi and sauerkraut found in the refrigerated section of stores are two possibilities for good bacteria. Also, probiotics and prebiotics in pill form may help. Research on other foods.

Next, the intestines need water. While drinks with electrolytes can help draw water into the intestines, watch if you are on a salt restrictive diet.  I read that plain water can just flush through. I find that powdered electrolyte drinks do not work for my low salt diet. Research needed for individuals.

Next, there is intestinal massage. a physical therapist can help train a person how to follow the route of the intestine by massaging across the belly in a correct direction. It‚Äôs helpful.

Then, here is another thought. each person has a Vagus nerve that extends the length of the body. It sends out signals to body parts and intestines. Am just starting to research how to stimulate the intestine via vagus nerve exercises. 

Last, my niece told me that she will eat 3 or 4 moist, dried prunes at night. I find that her remedy along with a morning coffee works. I question if I am getting enough of my needed electrolytes via this method

Last, last thought. Years ago, I had pain in my gut. By the time I was diagnosed, I had eschemic colitis and almost lost part of my intestine. I also have diverticulitis that can become inflamed. if one has ongoing, persistent pain, it needs attention from a health care professional. Also, some GI doctors work with gut motility.

I am not a health care practitioner, just one who is curious and is going to find out what works for me so I am tossing out a whole bunch of thoughts. do your own research.

1oa244a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingInIndia/comments/1oa244a/i_kissed_my_date_in_public_and_he_said_i_cant_walk/,"I kissed my date in public and he said ""I can't walk."" üòÇ","Wholesome post. No conflict. Just felt like sharing.  
  
Lemme start by saying that I've been single for two years now and celibate for one. I used to call myself a femcel, or at least a belladonna of sadness but if I'm going to be honest, it was more of an aesthetic than an identity.   
  
So I met this guy on some app almost a year ago. I was severely depressed and suffered from constant depersonalization on most days, so I didn‚Äôt want to go out with anyone, even though I would occasionally get high and swipe up and down a dating app or two. Unhealthy habits before bed.  
  
This guy... has asked me out a million times, and I always said no because he sucked at planning. It was always a last moment call for a low effort coffee date. I also did not want to travel so much because I live in the suburbs. If I asked him ""are you free on Sunday"" he would say something completely neurodivergent like ""Coming to navi tomo. Day after i'm going to andheri."" which totally did not answer my question and wasn't relevant info to me so I would get frustrated and ragequit dating. His idea of a date was inviting me straight into his bachelorpad in Malad and I would be like ""You're inviting me over... for the first date... but do you even have snacks? S tier snacks. Like Bakarwadi."" And he would be like ""What is Bakarwadi."" So undateable amirite?  
  
But I still liked him as a person because he has an interesting career (and I like people who are nerdy about their professions) and he likes streeties, so I kept in touch with him on socials. I was happy to just be friends if he wasn't so annoying and didn't have bad music taste. If you say I was breadcrumbing him, I wouldn‚Äôt disagree! But, in my defense, I was clear about my timeline and about my reasons for turning him down. I‚Äôve always told him upfront that I‚Äôm depressed and don‚Äôt feel like going out but I would also entertain the possibility of planning a date every now and then. It was a tough period for me when I was ghosting even my best friends and cousins, so what were the chances of meeting a rando. I can't describe it but I've cancelled so many plans because of crippling depresonalization. I would simply say ""I can't because I don't feel like a person"" and expect the other person to just understand. Severed so many friendships this way.  
  
He used to be extremely annoying, and you might even say he was crossing my boundaries, not respecting my digital space. He would call me many times. (Usually, if someone calls me without first asking for permission in text, I block them right away because I think it‚Äôs improper millennial etiquette.) I put him on mute, and that‚Äôs where he stayed until the day before our first date. He also sucked so bad at planning a date which made me feel like he he did not actually try to know me as a person. I thought he just wanted to get into my pants. I don't date guys who like me only for my body and not my personality. I hate guys who think they are entitled to a date just because we accidentally matched on an app. I even told him if you're going to be so persistent at least don't be indecissive and plan a date that I might actually be interested in. He laughs at everything I say (out of fear) and he did say he was scared of disapointing me but I told him I am already disapointed and he laughed even more. Trust me I have roasted this guy so many times and he still didn't go away.   
  
My depression started to clear up a bit, and I started to admire his persistence, even feeling guilty for breadcrumbing him for over a year, so I said, hey, do you wanna meet me this evening? I know it was so random and very double standards of me to do to him what I was tired of him doing to me, ie, making half assed last moment plans that would undoubtedly make both of us miserable and die of cringe but he was nothing but game. He seemed more excited than a golden retriever, but I just wanted to get it over with. I was hoping that if he saw me at the end of a long day with no makeup, he would finally stop asking me out.  
  
He even voluntarily offered to drive all the way down to Thane, which is where I live. He lives in Malad (which is where all the broke hobosexual fuckbois live.) It‚Äôs a huge deal, trust me, because nobody wants to hang out in Thane and part of me actually wanted him to suffer.  
  
I also showed up late on purpose. Before the date, my friend asked me if I wanted to grab tea, and I literally told her, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt because I‚Äôm meeting this Chh√¶p.‚Äù She laughed and said, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre blowing me off for a guy you don‚Äôt even like. Is he at least hot?‚Äù And I said, no, he‚Äôs your usual mid-looking neurodivergent guy.  
  
So next thing I know, I‚Äôm on this date that only half my ass volunteered to be on, but I‚Äôm absolutely vibing. We‚Äôre having the best conversation, covering topics that only friends who‚Äôve been friends for decades would riff on. Insane sexual chemistry too, because we‚Äôre both so funny (and that‚Äôs the only thing I find sexy.) I text my bestie, ""Isn't it annoying when you wanna hate someone but youre vibing? What an asshole.""  
  
Then I check the time. It‚Äôs been three hours of non-stop drunken yapping. So I ask for the cheque, offer to pay half, but he violently declines. I ask him if he wants to walk me home because I didn‚Äôt want the date to end.  
  
So we‚Äôre walking home, and right when we‚Äôre passing a dark, unlit part of the pavement, I pull him closer and we kiss. I hear another pedestrian approaching, so we break it off and continue walking, but he‚Äôs not moving and looks super embarrassed, so I ask him what‚Äôs up. ‚ÄúEverything ok?‚Äù And he says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt walk.‚Äù  
I don‚Äôt understand, so I start walking again anyway. Not my problem if he can‚Äôt catch up. And then I understand... and start laughing... so hard that I'm tearing... I book him a cab and send him home.  
  
After I reach home, I just text him, ‚ÄúSorry for giving you a boner.‚Äù And he just says, ‚ÄúPleassure.‚Äù

anyway, all of this has been to ask, would it be stupid to end all of this with a ‚Äúthank you, and goodbye.‚Äù? basically, i have a text written up describing how i wont be able to meet with him again but i am grateful for the opportunity of getting to know him and understand love better. i know i would enjoy receiving that message, especially if i felt like i lost a friend.. but idk if it would seem like i have evil intentions. i dont. but i cant make a good enough argument to send it either.

1oa1zk7,https://i.redd.it/31b8xjmaowvf1.png,Eight Seconds of Freedom: My Country Awakening,"In 1994, a girlfriend opened my eyes to the heart and soul of American Country music. As a Canadian, I‚Äôd traversed the backroads and highways of the United States, knowing its landscape like the palm of my hand‚Äîbetter, even, than the Americans I met. I had memories in every American state. But my heart belonged to Metallica, Iron Maiden, and the heavy riffs that thundered through my veins. Country? I dismissed it as mere folk music, a soundtrack for line dancing and boots clacking on wooden floors.

>""What do you get when you play a country music record backwards?¬†You get you wife back, your truck back, your dog back...""‚ÄîRascal Flatts

Oh, how wrong I was. My girlfriend was from Saskatchewan, which is a Canadian province akin to warm beer. But over a few weeks, she exposed me to elements that appealed to her and the music ripped my heart free. It added a missing piece to my American puzzle. Country music grabbed me headfirst into its rich narratives, playful lyrics, epic tomes, and soulful ""catchy"" tunes. I learned what an eight-second ride meant, the adrenaline rush of trying to stay atop a bucking bronco as it fought for freedom, and I dove into the genre like it was my own personal Area 51.

Fast forward two years, and life took a different turn. After quitting our jobs at a small publishing company, we found ourselves driving through the vast American West, eventually settling in Laramie, Wyoming, where I scraped by with illegal work. I was a gas station attendant and a mechanic's apprentice, earning a meager four bucks an hour. My girlfriend, longing for something more glamorous, turned her nose up at waitressing under the table, fearing it would lead to her being sent back home. I couldn‚Äôt believe the absurdity of it all. If I had lost access to America, my life would have crashed. I'd spent a year of my life working illegally, waiting to be caught and deported, and forever forbidden to return to my adopted-homeland. She had never even seen an actual ocean wave, who was she kidding?

One night, after a long shift, I returned to our motel in an old Dodge pickup truck‚Äî‚Äú*Old Blue*,‚Äù they called it, despite its black body and lone blue door. *She* had splurged on a $60 coffee maker from Walmart, while I was toiling away for $40 a day. My love for her slipped through my fingers like gritty Texas sand.

Desperate for an escape, I found solace in the local bar, where I shared drinks with real cowboys‚Äîsix rugged souls with stories etched into their weathered faces. They beckoned me to join them for six weeks of work, driving a hundred head of cattle to Denver, Colorado. My heart raced at the thought. I hadn‚Äôt ridden a horse since I was a boy, and the allure of that cowboy life felt thrilling and terrifying. But my girlfriend axed it with her usual ""absolutely not"" and that was that. 

When money grew tight, we moved in with Jerry, my boss‚Äîthe gas station owner, a man whose obsession with firearms was evident in the way guns spilled from his dresser drawers. My girlfriend hated every second we spent at Jerry's. She was insistant as she sipped her goddamn fresh-brew of coffee. As I learned to install shocks on a Ford F-150, she was glued to Jerry's 200 channels, lost in a current world that felt increasingly foreign to me. My Dad offered to pay for her Greyhound home, if I stayed on and continued living a Wyoming life. But I felt responsible for going back when absolutely all hope was gone and trying to find a real job in the real world. 

I loved pumping gas in an American town of 10,000 people. I knew the locals. I shoveled their driveways and plowed their lots with Old Blue and her snowplow. If I were pumping gas back ""home,"" I'd be suicidal. In Wyoming, it was freedom. At any time I could leave and never look back. I could go to Kentucky and pump gas and be happy for a while. I could go to some suburb of Boston or Chicago, and pump gas for awhile.

Eventually, we returned to Vancouver, defeated by the unforgiving Snowy Range of Wyoming. In a twist of fate, I chose to leave her behind and take my father‚Äôs advice to explore Europe with my brother and cousins. I spent the next six months in Estonia, driving a bus for the first Christian missionaries to plant their flag in the Baltic state, newly freed two years from Soviet rule.

Amidst my cassette tapes‚ÄîGuns N‚Äô Roses, Ozzy Osbourne, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe‚Äîwas a lone Garth Brooks album. One frigid night, as a blizzard howled outside, I drove missionaries to a village. They left me alone, knowing I wasn‚Äôt there for God (I think it was a mutual understanding between us), and I played my music. It was then that Garth‚Äôs ‚Äú*I‚Äôm Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)*‚Äù began to play. The lyrics hit me hard, especially a line that sparked my curiosity in a world where answers were still sought in libraries:

""...*a worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux/ lonely women and bad booze/ seem to be the only friends I've left at all./ And the white lines are getting longer/ and the saddle's gettin' cold/ And I'm much too young to feel this damn old*.""

Who the hell was this... Chris LeDoux? How had I, and everyone I knew who claimed to be a country fan, missed this incredible artist? A genuine cowboy who rode rodeos and made music as a heartfelt side passion‚Äîhe even recorded a song with Jon Bon Jovi! He was epic and exclusive, a cowboy/country singer of immense talent. 

I dove into his music, downloading every album, pouring over every lyric, captivated by his spirit and the rawness of his rodeo life. An *eight-second ride*‚Äîa test of skill and courage trying to ride a bull for eight long seconds‚Äîit became a metaphor for the wildness of life itself. It was more than just a time limit; it was a dance with danger, a fleeting moment of glory before the inevitable dismount and mad dash from an angry bull.

Chris LeDoux faced a cruel fate, his life cut short by a brutal battle with cancer, but his music lived on, whispering stories of the cowboy life to anyone willing to listen. I still can‚Äôt fathom why, despite his brilliance, no one seems to know his name. Pound for pound, he deserves every ounce of a Johnny Cash legacy. It‚Äôs baffling that such a talented songwriter and Hall of Fame rodeo champion slipped under the radar, not ever hitting my ears through the radio waves of months of Wyoming, Oklahoma, and even Nashville. No one I've asked knows his work.

So here‚Äôs to Garth Brooks‚Äîthank you for that one song, for introducing me to our shared friend, Chris LeDoux, in a post-Soviet Estonia where the missionaries were pushing me to accept Christ as my co-pilot. In that moment, amidst the blizzards and the loneliness, I found a connection to a world I never knew I longed for, a world where the spirit of the cowboy lives on in song.

1oa1ws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1oa1ws6/i_dont_think_we_cure_depression_right/,I don‚Äôt think we cure depression right,"Note: I know this might sound idealistic, but I genuinely think we're missing the social and preventive side of mental health.

According to statistics, nearly 30% of adults have been diagnosed with depression at least once in their lifetime. Right now, nearly 5% of adults are still facing depression. Just 5% and that doesn‚Äôt even feel like a huge number of people you actually know and talk to on a regular basis, right? But on the other hand, that‚Äôs every 20th person you actually know.

The problem is that the 5% of people having depression is more like an estimate from therapists, and the actual number is likely even higher. The issue is that not everyone wants to see a therapist, and not everyone realizes that they need to, because their mental health isn‚Äôt in a normal state at all. Some just don‚Äôt have money for therapy or medication. Some are focused on building their careers, raising a child, and don‚Äôt have enough time for themselves to actually go to a therapist and ask for help.

What is actually wrong? It seems like it‚Äôs natural to have depression from time to time, and 30% of adults have faced or will face it during their lifetime. That‚Äôs our biology, right?

I agree in some way, but let‚Äôs look at one of the most common periods in life when people face depression for the first time. Sure, that‚Äôs all just statistics, but most people usually experience depression during these stages:

Young adults (ages 18‚Äì25) - have the highest rates of depression. Most people start to feel that something is wrong right at this age. The problem? How are you actually supposed to know that you‚Äôre depressed and that something is wrong with you when no one literally talks about it? We all know there are therapists, but let‚Äôs be honest let's imagine you just don‚Äôt have money for one, and you need to ask for financial support from your parents. Not everyone actually thinks that depression is a serious issue. Your parents might simply say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all right, why spend money on silly things?‚Äù The problem is that this person missed the opportunity to treat their depression before it might turn into a serious disease.

According to statistics, the highest suicide rates are in the 15‚Äì29 age group. How is this related? The issue is that nearly 65% of people who decided to commit suicide had major depressive disorder or another depressive illness at the time.

The other group that is highly impacted is people aged 60+. Seems strange, right? Most commonly, this age group should be happier just because they usually own a house, have a car, have children or even grandchildren. They can live a good life. In the EU, you have a good pension at this age, which allows you quite a lot. You‚Äôre most likely to have finances and financial support from your children.

The issue is that loneliness is a tough thing. Loneliness is when you can‚Äôt really talk with someone when you truly need to. You want to talk about how hard it actually is to live alone in your house without your wife, with whom you were married for nearly 50 years. But with whom? Your neighbors aren‚Äôt really interested. Your kids might be too busy with their work or raising their own children, and your friends might not even be alive at this age.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having your own free time, nothing wrong with raising children and going to work to build your career. To be honest, both are good decisions. But the issue is that many people around you might need just 5 minutes of your time to feel happier and needed.

You might say there are nearly 332 million people in the world facing depression right now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have 5 minutes per day for each of them.‚Äù You know, you‚Äôre actually right. But I didn‚Äôt ask you to start spamming everyone in the world with emails like ‚ÄúIf you feel depressed, I‚Äôm here for you.‚Äù Just look around.

Every 20th person has been diagnosed with depression. The actual number is even higher. Maybe it‚Äôs your 16-year-old son who loves a girl, confessed to her, and got rejected. Maybe it‚Äôs your wife, overloaded from being on maternity leave and not really leaving the house to have some fun or maybe she just doesn‚Äôt have friends to have fun with. Maybe it‚Äôs your boyfriend who‚Äôs been sad for a few months and you don‚Äôt know the actual reason. Maybe it‚Äôs your friend who just got fired from their job or got divorced. Maybe it‚Äôs your classmate who got bullied in school just because his clothes don‚Äôt look as nice as yours, just because he‚Äôs from a poor family and can‚Äôt afford them.

Why do we all send people to therapy when we can prevent the initial thing that causes depression? Sure, it‚Äôs completely fine to ask a professional for help, but imagine you‚Äôre told to unload a gun. You wouldn‚Äôt shoot the gun until it was empty, would you? Most likely, you‚Äôd just take out the clip.

So why don‚Äôt we do the same with depression? Sure, it‚Äôs great that there are therapists who are willing to help, but instead why not stop bullying your classmate just because he doesn‚Äôt look cool? Why don‚Äôt you come back home and talk to your wife, who hasn‚Äôt been leaving the house much, and maybe tell her to call a friend and go for a walk? Or if she doesn‚Äôt have a friend, why not say, ‚ÄúHi, honey, I‚Äôm so proud of you. I know you‚Äôre tired. Let me take a week off, stay with the kids, cook us some food, and we‚Äôll just watch that movie we‚Äôve been putting off for so long.‚Äù Why don‚Äôt we call our dad or mom, ask them how they feel, and invite them to our house for dinner? Why don‚Äôt you ask your friend how he‚Äôs feeling after his divorce and invite him for a walk with coffee?

All these actions are not that hard to do, and they don‚Äôt require much effort. But you can actually improve someone‚Äôs life, or even prevent someone from losing it.

Be supportive and less toxic, guys. Every action you take actually matters. Today, you might spend just 5 minutes to prevent the inevitable. And tomorrow, a small act of support from someone else might help you.",2,1760808836.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs inner work.¬†



This post is for anyone fed up with surface-level advice and wants real, science-backed, no-BS tools to actually regulate stress, stop overreacting, and move through life with more ease. This isn‚Äôt just some bro-y stoic checklist or spiritual bypassing tips. It‚Äôs deep work, but made simple. Compiled from neuroscience research, actual psychology books, podcasts by licensed therapists, and insights from high-performing people who‚Äôve figured out how not to lose it when life happens.¬†



Here are 6 sharp lessons that will actually make you a chill person (not just look like one):



\*\*1. Regulate your nervous system before you try to be ‚Äúchill‚Äù\*\*



You can‚Äôt fake calm if your body is constantly in fight-or-flight. According to Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist), the key to real composure starts with your nervous system. Breathwork, cold exposure, and even eye movement patterns can shift you out of stress mode. Start small. Try the physiological sigh (two inhales, one long exhale). It‚Äôs clinically proven to lower cortisol faster than meditation. Source: Huberman Lab Podcast, Ep 42.



\*\*2. Stop overidentifying with every thought or feeling\*\*



Chill people don‚Äôt take every emotion as truth. They build a buffer between trigger and response. This idea is reinforced by Dr. Judson Brewer (Brown University psychiatrist), who says mindfulness isn‚Äôt about zoning out, it‚Äôs about zooming out. When you can observe your anger or anxiety instead of acting it out, you buy time to respond like the person you want to be. See ‚ÄúUnwinding Anxiety‚Äù for more on this.



\*\*3. Learn ‚Äúnon-reactive confidence‚Äù from actual high performers\*\*



Ryan Holiday's research into Stoicism shows how some of the most ‚Äúchill‚Äù leaders (Marcus Aurelius, George Washington, even Tom Brady) had one thing in common: emotional boundaries. They trained themselves to respond with clarity, not chaos. Being calm is not the absence of feeling, but control over when it‚Äôs expressed. Source: ‚ÄúThe Obstacle Is the Way.‚Äù



\*\*4. Kill the need to be liked by everyone\*\*



Social approval is a drug. And needing it makes you easy to manipulate. Researchers like Bren√© Brown (University of Houston) argue that chill people aren‚Äôt emotionally detached, they just have strong internal validation. When you stop chasing everyone‚Äôs approval, you stop spiraling from every passive-aggressive comment or awkward silence. That space is where real chill lives.



\*\*5. Cut the information overload\*\*



Doomscrolling is nervous system poison. The more inputs your brain‚Äôs processing (notifications, arguments, news, unsolicited advice), the more reactive you get. Cal Newport (Georgetown professor, ‚ÄúDigital Minimalism‚Äù) suggests strategic disconnection. Have time offline every day. Not for ‚Äúself-care.‚Äù For sanity. Cognitive overload is a hidden killer of real calm.



\*\*6. Practice ‚Äúlow stimulation‚Äù joy\*\*



We‚Äôre conditioned to chase loud, flashy highs. But chill people feel at peace doing boring stuff, long walks, solo coffee, doing the dishes in silence. Dopamine research from Dr. Anna Lembke (author of ‚ÄúDopamine Nation‚Äù) shows that overstimulation kills contentment. By choosing low-dopamine activities, you reset your brain to enjoy smaller, slower pleasures. That‚Äôs where chill actually lives.



Here‚Äôs a set of tools, books, and apps that can help you go from wired to grounded. These are not fluff. If you take even one of these seriously, your life will shift, especially your ability to stay chill when others are spiraling.



\*\*Books to rewire your emotional response system (aka make you actually chill)\*\*



\- \*\*‚ÄúDopamine Nation‚Äù by Dr. Anna Lembke\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†Stanford psychiatrist. NYT Bestseller. A brutal, brilliant breakdown of why we can‚Äôt stop seeking stimulation, and how to reclaim balance. This book will make you question every ‚Äúfun‚Äù thing you do. Insanely good read if you want to understand why you feel anxious even when nothing‚Äôs wrong. Best book I‚Äôve read on addiction to speed (not the drug, the vibe).



\- \*\*‚ÄúThe Myth of Normal‚Äù by Dr. Gabor Mat√©\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†International bestseller. Mat√© is one of the most respected trauma experts in the world. This book connects physical health, trauma, and emotional dysregulation, aka why you snap at your roommate for chewing loudly. It‚Äôll undo everything you think about what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù This is the best book on how chronic stress eats your mind and body.



\- \*\*‚ÄúThe Daily Stoic‚Äù by Ryan Holiday\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†Not just quotes. It‚Äôs literal daily mental training. Helps you practice calm, non-reactive, high-integrity decision making. Oprah approved. Navy SEALs read this. It‚Äôs like emotional push-ups for people who want to be chill under pressure.



\*\*Podcasts that teach you emotional regulation like it‚Äôs a skill\*\*



\- \*\*The Huberman Lab\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†Hosted by Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman. Not some crystal energy talk. Real tools backed by science, like how light, breath, and posture affect your stress. Start with the episode ‚ÄúHow to Control Your Stress Response.‚Äù Changed the way I treat my mornings.



\- \*\*Unlocking Us with Bren√© Brown\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†She blends pop culture with psychology, and her interviews go deep. One of the few podcasts where you‚Äôll laugh and then cry in the same episode. Start with the episode on boundaries, it‚Äôll shift how you see emotional exhaustion.



\*\*Apps and tools to train your brain to stay chill\*\*



\- \*\*BeFreed\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†This is a genius AI-powered app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns vetted books, expert research, and real success stories into short podcast-style lessons tailored to your goals.

What‚Äôs wild is that it already has full coverage of the books I mentioned above. It‚Äôs perfect for people who say they don‚Äôt have time to read but desperately want to stop spiraling emotionally. Best app for emotional growth without the fluff.



\- \*\*Waking Up by Sam Harris\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†Not just meditation. It‚Äôs like mindfulness meets philosophy. The lessons on how to observe your thoughts instead of being consumed by them will change how you experience stress. Use it 10 minutes a day and you start responding, not reacting.



\- \*\*Balance app\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†If you get overwhelmed easily or can‚Äôt meditate without feeling like you‚Äôre failing, this one‚Äôs for you. It teaches emotional regulation through small, game-like exercises. Good for beginners who want calm but have no clue how to get there.



\- \*\*YouTube: Therapy in a Nutshell\*\*¬†¬†

¬†¬†Therapist Emma McAdam breaks down big mental health topics into digestible videos. Her series on emotional mastery is gold. Way more helpful than random TikTok therapists who just tell you to drink water or ‚Äúcut toxic people.‚Äù

Tacoma sleeps with its eyes half-open, and the safehouse smelt like ghosts from circuits run too hot. We crowded around a ring of dim light and jittering AR feeds, each feed caught a different angle on a face built to make you trust it before you knew why.

Isamu Watanabe.

Renraku‚Äôs North American EVP of R&D. Tech visionary. Corporate messiah. The man that might be holding the last thread to Alexis‚Äôs brother‚Äîand the leash to whatever the Kitsune Protocol really was.

‚ÄúI want to punch him in the teeth and ask him for a raise,‚Äù Ichiro said, arms folded, watching the main feed cycle through press interviews. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs talent.‚Äù

Onscreen, Isamu laughed at a joke the mic missed. The clip flipped to him guiding a tour through the upper levels of the Renraku Corporate Tower ‚Äî glossy smiles, immaculate suits, subdermal glints danced in the light like they practiced. The voice was warm and measured, just gruff enough to trust and just lyrical enough you‚Äôd trust him again.

I lit a synthstick and didn't look away from the feed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen con men with worse PR.‚Äù

Alexis stood behind us, arms crossed tight, eyes on a new puff piece crowning Isamu as architect of a cognitive utopia. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in all of them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNever at the edge. Always the sun in the middle. Everyone else is just orbiting.‚Äù She added, quieter, more focused ‚ÄúFollow the shadow that moves like light. Tucker‚Äôs note. It‚Äôs him.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan‚Äôs got media discipline,‚Äù Ichiro muttered. ‚ÄúNot a single unscripted moment in any of these. Even his slip-ups are choreographed.‚Äù

I leaned forward, thumbed the touchpad, and froze the frame. Isamu mid-turn, mouth open, eyes glinting like delight as a performance note. It should look candid. It looked staged.¬†

‚ÄúSo this is the guy that built the Protocol.‚Äù I said half to myself, half to no one.¬†

‚ÄúWhich means if we want to find where the Protocol lives,‚Äù Alexis said, ‚ÄúWe start by cracking his flat.‚Äù

Ichiro snorted. ‚ÄúFlat doesn‚Äôt cover it,‚Äù He filled the air with schematics; blueprints scrubbed from public access but reclaimed through favors, bribes, and intrusions he swore won‚Äôt lead back to us.

‚ÄúPenthouse in the heart of Bellevue,‚Äù he said, as he tapped wireframes. ‚ÄúTop three floors of a corporate VIP block. Standard suite is 550 square meters. Watanabe‚Äôs got triple that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes he commute from there?‚Äù I asked.

Ichiro grinned. ‚ÄúLimos, armored shuttles, the occasional drone lift. Never on foot. Never alone. Five vehicles rotated this week. I‚Äôve got trackers on all of them now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou bugged his cars?‚Äù Alexis‚Äôs eyebrow lifted.

‚ÄúHe parks in places with bad perimeter cams,‚Äù he said, smugly. ‚ÄúThe city has rats. I‚Äôm one with cleaner paws.‚Äù

I chuckled once and turned back to the layout. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the vault situation?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dug through building permits, old zoning filings, and ‚ÄòHVAC‚Äô retrofits,‚Äù Ichiro said, layering diagrams. ‚ÄúLast year he added a substructure. Reinforced structural supports, isolated power draw, independent coolant loop. Hidden under the central living area. I‚Äôd bet a left optic that‚Äôs his vault.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about Matrix security?‚Äù Alexis asked.

‚ÄúLocal grid‚Äôs on Renraku‚Äôs backbone. Triple-encrypted.‚Äù He zoomed on a lattice of lines. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs got a secondary local net inside the suite. Old-school, air-gapped. That‚Äôs the juice. You don‚Äôt squeeze it unless you‚Äôre in the room.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe get in the room, then,‚Äù I said.

Alexis didn‚Äôt smile. ‚ÄúAnd we find out if what‚Äôs inside can still lead us to Tucker.‚Äù

Silence folded in. The screens painted long shadows and the city‚Äôs hum outside sounded like a lullaby sung off-key.

‚ÄúWatanabe doesn‚Äôt go anywhere alone,‚Äù Ichiro said.

‚ÄúWe figured that,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo, I mean‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs guarded. Four Red Samurai. Not just any. The same ones from the Chrome Veil.‚Äù

It hits like dropping a wrench in a tight room‚Äîmetal on metal, no give.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù Alexis‚Äôs voice went cold.

‚ÄúFacial tags, gait, armor loadouts. It‚Äôs them.‚Äù Ichiro responded, a serious tone crept into his voice. .¬†

My jaw tightened. ‚ÄúWell, that confirms it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the one we‚Äôre after.‚Äù Alexis said, brittle.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the reason we need to be careful.‚Äù Ichiro added.

We watched the footage again‚ÄîIsamu entering an elevator flanked by four soldiers in mirrored crimson. Silent. Deadly. Patient. Ghosts with names.

‚ÄúOptions?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI have his schedule,‚Äù Ichiro said. ‚ÄúDay after tomorrow. Afternoon. He‚Äôs at Renraku HQ for a private board review. That gives us a three-hour window.‚Äù

Alexis nodded. ‚ÄúThen we use it.‚Äù

He brought up a list‚Äînonlethal gear, maglock bypass tools, temp SIN packages. ‚ÄúI know a person. South Tacoma. Runs gear through an old HVAC shell company. She can work miracles on short notice.‚Äù

I took one last drag from the synthstick and extinguished it in the cracked ceramic dish. A graveyard of synthsticks and cigarette butts which lived as a testament to our awareness of the math ahead of us. Calculus, proofs, and equations no one had managed to solve yet. I exhaled slowly. ‚ÄúWe go hunting. Then we pay your fixer a visit.‚Äù

As we woke the next morning, gray broke in that permanent Seattle way‚Äîlight that won‚Äôt commit, static across the city‚Äôs skin.

We split up.

Ichiro anchored at the safehouse, hand-feeding bad credentials into permit servers and kicking false system updates to mask our movement. He narrated across my commlink in a low murmur‚Äîjust enough telemetry to trust the ground we‚Äôre about to steal. Alexis and I hit the street.

We drove the van and headed north‚ÄîTacoma‚Äôs low roofs slipped past like bad memories. The wipers smeared the rain into workable shapes. The freeway unrolled in damp gray ribbons, gantries blinking our borrowed SINs and pretending to believe them. Freight crawled. Americar cabs wove. The grid kept rebalancing lanes the way a dealer adjusts odds when a mark starts winning.

Mile markers turned into telemetry, soft checkpoints ahead, patrol drone on an eastbound vector, traffic cam cycling to maintenance mode in sixty seconds if we needed it. Bellevue‚Äôs glow sat out there past the dark water like a promise made by someone you shouldn‚Äôt trust. I drove with two fingers and a jaw that didn‚Äôt want to unclench.

The Kent valley warehouses rose out of the tired ports of Tacoma, dominated by manufacturing, logistics hubs, and light-to-heavy industrial zones; then the road hooked around the south end of the lake and the corporate air got colder and cleaner. Towers in Bellevue wore their reflections like armor‚Äîmirror-skin that gave back nothing you could use. Every third billboard sold serenity; every fourth sold a gun you‚Äôd never legally own in that district. Security didn‚Äôt strut here; it expressed itself in polite signage and cameras that never blinked.

Alexis rode quiet, watching the edges; doorways, awnings. She didn‚Äôt fidget. She didn‚Äôt smile. When the skyline finally crowded the windshield, she breathed once, shallow, like a swimmer sighting the finish before the last push. I checked the clock, checked the mirrors, the habit that made me check both again. We slid off the arterial and into side streets where the rain felt curated.

(**MUSIC**: [https://youtu.be/dCBNHIUeqiA?si=0fj2C8hzHhLYivfG](https://youtu.be/dCBNHIUeqiA?si=0fj2C8hzHhLYivfG))¬†

By the time we parked two blocks shy of his building, the city had done its trick and made itself look harmless. I killed the engine, let the fans spin down, and listened to the rain test the seals. Ichiro fed us one more thread; two staff exits, one service stairwell blind spot, and then went quiet on purpose. We stepped out into the drizzle and walked like we belonged.

First stop: a caf√© tucked under the east face of Watanabe‚Äôs residential block. Corporate staff and house managers rotate through. A perfect place to catch a stray sentence or a hint of a name said at the wrong time.

Alexis didn't wear expensive. She wore convincing: soft navy coat, low-heeled boots, hair in a loose braid that said she never tried too hard. Ichiro burned her commlink ID clean at dawn. She walked in like she just finished a ten-hour shift and the upstairs neighbors made it longer.

Her mark was there: a woman early fifties, sharp eyes, tidy uniform. A personal chef. The cuffs on her sleeves carry saffron like an afterthought.

We took the table near hers and waited three minutes. I felt the air bend around Alexis the way heat bends over asphalt. It‚Äôs subtle, no glow, no fireworks, just the sense of a pressure change, like the room decided to like her. She murmured a phrase so soft I caught only the cadence, the disciplined warmth of it. It unsettled me. The human part of me bristled at how a will can tilt under a touch you can‚Äôt see.

The woman looked over. Suspicion drained. A smile arrived like a memory from somewhere nicer.

‚ÄúRough shift?‚Äù Alexis asked with a practiced, tired warmth.

The chef laughed a little too fast and followed with ‚ÄúAlways is when he‚Äôs in residence‚Äù as she took a sip from the prim demitasse in front of her.¬†

‚ÄúHe?‚Äù Alexis gently prodded as she sipped her tea. ‚ÄúThe one with the four bodyguards and the top-floor view?‚Äù

A pause. Caution, not resistance.

‚ÄúYou work in the building?‚Äù the chef asked in a slight confused haze.

‚ÄúConsulting. Temp clearance. Data hygiene. I‚Äôm not even supposed to know who he is.‚Äù Alexis leaned in. ‚ÄúBut those guards? They scream ‚Äònot just payroll.‚Äô‚Äù

The chef let out a dry chuckle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the polite way to put it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWord is he‚Äôs charming in meetings.‚Äù Alexis said as she pressed her influence on the chef.

‚ÄúHe is.‚Äù The smile never fully materialized. ‚ÄúCharming like a scalpel.‚Äù The chef took another sip of espresso.

Alexis let that hang, then nudged: ‚ÄúI heard he fired a bellhop last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor breathing wrong,‚Äù the woman muttered. ‚ÄúNo warning. Just gone. No payout, no message. Kid didn‚Äôt even take his shoes with him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat happen a lot?‚Äù Alexis responded with the tone of someone carefully reeling in a fish.¬†

‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs in a mood? Yes. People vanish. Not dramatically. Just‚Ä¶ paperless. Like they never drew a paycheck.‚Äù The chef raised the demitasse to her lips and finished her espresso with a reserved sigh.

‚ÄúWhat kind of moods?‚Äù Alexis quipped while taking a sip of her tea.

The chef glanced around and leaned in. ‚ÄúHe gets still. That‚Äôs the worst of it. Not angry. Not tense. Just quiet. And then someone‚Äôs career ends.‚Äù

Alexis nods like she understands, because she does. The pull of her influence ebbs without a seam. The woman blinks at her empty cup, surprised to find it empty.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Alexis says, standing. ‚ÄúFor the company.‚Äù

The woman smiled faintly.

We shifted two blocks south to an underground garage. I waited just outside while Alexis met the mark: ex-maintenance tech for Renraku private residences, ‚Äúresigned‚Äù under circumstances the paperwork never bothered to explain. I listened on comms. The audio hissed through with an anxious tremor in the man‚Äôs voice. He was nervous enough that Alexis didn‚Äôt need magic. A soft smile and a credstick that was confident was enough.

‚ÄúHe never hits anyone,‚Äù the tech said. ‚ÄúBut he looks at you like he‚Äôs already buried you. You don‚Äôt need more than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever see the vault?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but I saw the heat-pump schematics. There‚Äôs a sealed zone next to the dining area. Triple-redundant coolant lines. Nobody builds that for wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccess?‚Äù

‚ÄúBiometric. Multi-point. Two guards minimum. Door‚Äôs a flat rectangle that hums. No seams.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ever work that room?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. It never showed on the schedule.‚Äù

And with that, he left. We watched his heat signature scuttle away on the AR overlay. The man moved quickly as if he didn‚Äôt like the air in his lungs holding the memory of the conversation. Can‚Äôt blame him.

That afternoon I walked the perimeter with Ichiro in my ear. Renraku‚Äôs aesthetic wrapped the building: clean, clinical, serene. From street level it looked like serenity. From surveillance, it looks like a trap.

Cameras nest high under the eaves, overlapping arcs. A facial scanner hid behind a planter that exists solely to pull faces within range.

But the east service stairwell had a blind spot.

I bought tea at a food truck across the street and watched two delivery runners enter without a full badge scan. One taps. The other waves. The door sighs open like it‚Äôs met them before.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre running a whitelist,‚Äù Ichiro murmured low on the comms. ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôre cleared, it doesn‚Äôt verify every time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we spoof a cleared ID?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOr we lift the access dongle. A guard will have one. We clone it, then spoof the biometric with a bypass.‚Äù Ichiro said as he detailed our options.

‚ÄúYou can get all that?‚Äù I asked, impressed.¬†

‚ÄúFor a price.‚Äù he chuckled.

Finished documenting the access into the building, Alexis and I returned to the van where we left 2 blocks away. Its matte black paint job still convinced the sharp eyed passerby to ignore it for more interesting marks. I walk around to the driver‚Äôs seat as Alexis takes the other side. We slid into the van like two shadows disappearing into the night. A quiet calm settled over us as the quiet moment lets us contemplate the gravity of what we were planning to do. We slowly pulled away to return to the safehouse to meet Ichiro and head to his fixer contact.¬†

22:00, South Tacoma. The ‚ÄúHVAC‚Äù waiting room smelled like radiator fluid and synth-pine. A receptionist who didn‚Äôt talk had a lit synthstick in one hand and watched us like we had answers to questions she hadn‚Äôt shared with us. A ceiling fan slowly turned with quiet reservation. It allowed a small squeak from a worn-out bearing once every other second. The desk was adorned with only a comm unit, a chipped coffee mug half full with a liquid the color of midnight that must have passed for soykaf in another lifetime, and an ash tray overflowing with butts. A security camera in the corner of the ceiling looked upon the scene with a lazy indifference as we sat on a set of plastic chairs against the far wall waiting.

The door to the office opened of its own accord and the receptionist finally gave the only verbal acknowledgement we were going to get. ‚ÄúShe will see you now.‚Äù

We entered the office. If you could call it that. It looked more like a workshop and a shrine to the electronic arts of entering a property you didn‚Äôt own, rent, or belong in. In the center of a room, a large table stood like a centerpiece at an art gallery. A tarp covered various items placed on the table with the general shape resembling the Cascade Mountains. There was a moderate sized desk against one wall oriented to face the door to the office. The desk was decorated with a computer, commlink, dividers for paper files like it was a museum piece, and a Cavalier Evanator Machine Pistol. The pistol looked angry, loaded, and like the safety was an option for other people to use. Standing behind the desk was Ichiro‚Äôs contact.

The fixer called herself Brilla. Camo pants, jacket that used to be military before fashion found it, AR tattoos idling as luminous snakes. The tattoos started to move if you stared too long. Brilla was attractive in the dangerous kind of way motorcycles are to the non-risk-adverse.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got cash?‚Äù No preamble.

I held up the credstick.

She smiled like a merchant moving product. Brilla picked up the Evanator and placed it in the holster she had mounted under her camo jacket and took a few steps towards the table in the center of the room. Brilla pulled the tarp off the table like a matador playing with a bull and we were greeted with a neat arrangement of professional looking tools of the trade.¬†

‚ÄúOne stealth suit per body‚Äîchameleon-threaded, thermal-dampened, no ballistic plating. You‚Äôre not getting shot, right?‚Äù she said with the confidence of a professional.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd rather not,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúLockpick autokits, sensor spoofers, camera loopers, and intrusion dongles tuned to Renraku‚Äôs secondary protocols. They‚Äôve been recycling encryption recently, so this might buy you two, maybe three minutes. Make it count.‚Äù

I turned a dongle over, appreciating the craftsmanship. ‚ÄúYou do this yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy crew does. You‚Äôre paying for that silence, too.‚Äù Brilla responded.

She opened a locked case and slid out a sleek unit stamped Blackburst.

I raised a brow. ‚ÄúWeapon?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPacket injector. Drops an impulse that makes a node think it had a full diagnostic reset. Buys you thirty seconds. Don‚Äôt use it twice on the same node.‚Äù

Alexis ran her palm across a stealth suit‚Äôs weave. ‚ÄúWill this get us past the Red Samurai?‚Äù

Brilla‚Äôs smile died. ‚ÄúNo. Nothing gets past Red Samurai. You avoid them. You don‚Äôt beat them. You go around. If you see them, it‚Äôs already too late.‚Äù

I nodded. The three of us packed up the van with the silent determination professionals have on the precipice of a run into the shadows. None of us wanted to think about the implications of what would happen if our planning failed us.¬†

We returned to the safehouse by 23:50. Gear stowed in sealed duffels. The air had the sharp taste of dread, and every screen hummed like it planed to outlast us.

I watched rain sketch exit routes on the blackout-draped windows. Alexis paced, coat off, sleeves rolled, hands moved when her mouth wasn't. Ichiro sat behind a constellation of holos‚Äîschematics, guard shifts, public schedules, and a pulsing calendar block: **WATANABE ‚Äì BOARD MTG 1300‚Äì1700**.

‚ÄúConfirmed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeeting starts at one. Four-hour agenda. Presentation, closed Q&A, shareholder breakout. Location: Renraku Tower Downtown‚Äîeight miles from his bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecurity uptick?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúInside the downtown tower only. He won‚Äôt completely thin residential security. The man‚Äôs gone, but his armor stays. Encrypted vehicle leaves 12:05. He‚Äôs not back before seventeen-hundred.‚Äù

‚ÄúGives us five hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree and a half,‚Äù he corrected. ‚ÄúAssume an early return window. Assume a deadman rotation‚Äîone Samurai stays.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt go loud.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ichiro said. ‚ÄúWe go perfect.‚Äù

‚ÄúIngress?‚Äù Alexis asked.

‚ÄúService stairwell, east side. Door‚Äôs whitelist-gated. We cloned a courier‚Äôs dongle. Biometric override needs the bypass you‚Äôre carrying‚ÄîBrilla‚Äôs toys spoof the ID for 180 seconds.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the vault?‚Äù

He threw up a 3D split of the penthouse‚Äîliving room, enclosed dining, a bedroom glaring at the skyline, and beneath it, a box of wrong numbers for heat. ‚ÄúPressure-sealed. Power-isolated. One access point‚Äîhere. Usually two guards, maybe down to one while he‚Äôs out. We loop the camera, spoof the lock, breach the vault.‚Äù

I studied the layout like a corp kid prepping for a university entrance exam. ‚ÄúWhat are the odds he‚Äôs got hardwired alerts to his commlink?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh. Keep the power dip under three percent, external systems won‚Äôt register a spike.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if we trip something?‚Äù Alexis asked.

‚ÄúWe leave,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúFast. Empty-handed.‚Äù

Ichiro blinked. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no data in that vault worth all three of us getting flatlined.‚Äù

Silence settled. Rain ticked the glass like it wanted in.

‚ÄúI can make it work,‚Äù Ichiro says finally. ‚ÄúBut once we go in, you follow my instructions exactly. No cowboy shit. No freelance heroics.‚Äù

I smiled. ‚ÄúYou practicing to be the boss?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says; half a smile spread across his lips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been the boss. You just never noticed.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt plan on me retiring anytime soon.‚Äù I responded.

I smiled the way a teacher does as they see their student graduate from novice to master. I placed my hand on Ichiro‚Äôs shoulder and patted it as I stepped out of the room and took the stairs to the roof of the safehouse for a moment of clarity.¬†

The rooftop was soaked and quiet. Tacoma‚Äôs skyline a necklace of LED lights under low industrial fog. Lights blinked in the distance like a heartbeat that didn‚Äôt belong to you. A lone rusting bench sat under the overhang. I took a seat and let the cold creep in. I lit a synthstick and looked over the cherry ember at the city with quiet resolve. The chemical taste hit like a memory of quiet stakeouts from a lifetime ago.

Alexis stepped out, collar already resigned to be wet from the endurance of Tacoma‚Äôs precipitation. She said nothing as she sat on the parapet wall beside me, legs swinging, shoes leaving dark commas on the wall.

We let the silence be what it needed to be.

She lit a cigarette. The flame jet from her lighter confident as a priest in confession. Once the cigarette glowed with purpose, the lighter‚Äôs jet disappeared like the confessor as soon as the ritual was over.

‚ÄúIt feels like we‚Äôre planning on breaking into the den of a monster and stealing from a man guarded by demons.‚Äù She mused into the void, gaze distant on the fog, on the LED lights strung on the horizon like a pearl necklace, and on the memory of Tucker.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou should write it down.‚Äù

She smiled, but her eyes didn't. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to come this far, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I did.‚Äù I replied. Feeling something stir in me for the first time in years. Some might have called it stupidity. The closest I could come up with was resolve.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Alexis asked gently. The desire to understand was sharp in her bright green eyes that I couldn‚Äôt turn from.

‚ÄúBecause Lauren used to say I looked most alive when I was helping people and when I didn‚Äôt know the plan.‚Äù A corner of my mouth lifted. ‚ÄúShe hated it. Said it was reckless. Said I liked danger more than stability.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was probably right.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was always right.‚Äù I flicked the synthstick into the gutter. ‚ÄúShe told me something else. A few days before she died. When I was deep in that case that came home and changed everything. She said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll find a way through this. Even if it‚Äôs through fire.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she mean this kind of fire?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she expected Renraku or Red Samurai,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe she expected me to burn a little before I came back.‚Äù

Alexis was quiet a long time. ‚ÄúI used to think I was the one protecting Tucker. Always shielding him. Always taking the hits.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But now‚Ä¶‚Äù She pulled on the cigarette and let it go out her nose. Twin plumes of smoke drifted down like a dragon snorting in reproach. ‚ÄúNow I wonder if I was just keeping him small. Keeping him in a box so he wouldn‚Äôt disappear.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your brother,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou fought to keep him from becoming something the world could take advantage of.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I did enough.‚Äù Her voice cracked very slightly and showed the doubt hiding just below her mask of control.

‚ÄúYou did more than anyone else would have. More than anyone else could have.‚Äù

She looked away. The cigarette burnt to a tight ember. I handed her a flask from my coat pocket I picked up during the day‚Äôs leg work; Glenlivit-18, because if tomorrow was to be our last sunrise I wanted to end the evening with a familiar friend. She took a careful sip and handed the flask back, quiet again. I nodded and pocketed it. We sat until the city hummed quieter.

Sometimes people think that closeness is letting down your walls; sharing your dreams, secrets, fears, and desires. It can be all of these things, and it can be none. Sometimes closeness is sitting next to someone and letting the silence join the two of you like an old friend. I took the cold, wet air into my lungs in a long morose breath and let it out like I was exercising the potential for failure. I stood up and put my hand gently on Alexis‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúGet some sleep. We‚Äôve got work tomorrow.‚Äù I said.¬†

I returned to the confines of the safe house. Years heavy on my shoulders like a hiker dreaming of basecamp. I laid down on one of the thin mattresses and let sleep take me: deep and dreamless.



(**MUSIC**: [https://youtu.be/6A2V9Bu80J4?si=iFtzK6\_uMfFReTBm](https://youtu.be/6A2V9Bu80J4?si=iFtzK6_uMfFReTBm))¬†

Dawn was a smear as we packed.

Brilla‚Äôs gear sprawled across the floor in tight bundles, each marked with a strip of cloth. Alexis took black. Ichiro gray. Mine was a dusky green that knew what it was. Every kit matched: stealth suit, mag-spoof tools, and packet injector.¬†

I strapped my shoulder pack with deliberate hands. No wasted motion.

Alexis watched the storm roll at the edge of the blackout curtain. From here, Bellevue felt distant, like we were already ghosts waiting to be recorded on someone else‚Äôs ledger.

‚ÄúNo magic inside the vault,‚Äù Ichiro reminds her. ‚ÄúToo many pressure differentials. One mana flare could trigger the defense nodes.‚Äù

I zipped the duffel and shoulder it. ‚ÄúThe courier ID you cloned‚Äîstill good?‚Äù

‚ÄúShould be. I skimmed the signal an hour ago. Same handshake. He hasn‚Äôt updated his keys.‚Äù Ichiro responded.

‚ÄúSloppy.‚Äù I mused

‚ÄúOr confident.‚Äù Ichiro retorted.

‚ÄúPickup point‚Äôs confirmed?‚Äù Alexis asked. Green eyes sharp and focused like determination hued in jade.

Ichiro nodded. ‚ÄúWe get in, get the data, exfil through the western maintenance corridor. I‚Äôve mapped vent feeds to route around us. Camera loops give us three minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we miss it?‚Äù I asked, because sometimes planning for the worst makes you believe it won‚Äôt happen.

‚ÄúWe improvise.‚Äù Alexis cut in with the matter-of-fact confidence of a veteran.

There was nothing left but waiting. The quiet calm before the storm where the butterflies in your stomach reminded you that the future has not yet been written. The place where uncertainty brews into anxiety. I count to four as I breathed in, held it for another four seconds, and breathed out in four. It‚Äôs rituals that keep people standing.

I made soykaf‚Äîblack and too strong. Alexis took hers straight. Ichiro didn‚Äôt drink; he stared down the public feeds on Watanabe‚Äôs block from three separate nodes like the city might twitch wrong if he blinked.

‚ÄúYou ever break into a place like this before?‚Äù Alexis asked, eyes sharp on me over the rim of her soykaf.

‚ÄúNot with a vault,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot with Red Samurai.‚Äù

‚ÄúEver run point on something where the cost of failure was this high?‚Äù she pressed.

I let the question breathe, then with quiet reservation I responded ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

By 10:45 we‚Äôre dressed, loaded, quiet.

‚ÄúEleven-oh-five,‚Äù Ichiro says. ‚ÄúWatanabe‚Äôs ride just pulled out.‚Äù

I nod.

We filed out‚Äîboots soft on old linoleum. The rain has eased, but the sky‚Äôs darker, everything quiet, subdued. Like the city was holding its breath. Even the gulls had assumed a cadence of quiet respect for the moment. At the threshold I glance back at the room. It felt final in a way it shouldn‚Äôt. I closed the door and silently moved into the gray morning.

Tacoma peeled away behind us in a smear of LED lights and wet concrete, wipers ticking time like a metronome for bad ideas. Alexis rode shotgun, quiet, eyes on the freeway signs sliding past‚ÄîTUKWILA, RENTON, BELLEVUE‚Äîas if they were tarot cards spelling out a future she already knew. Ichiro hunched in the back with the gear. He murmured checks to himself; power, keys, failsafes. An engineer‚Äôs prayer. I kept my hands at ten and two and told myself not to speed. Hard to feel innocent when you‚Äôre carrying an electronic toolkit for a very specific lock. We parked the van a few blocks from the complex and dismounted.¬†

We walked without chatter. Alexis watched everything‚Äîcars, rooftops, reflections in glass. Once, her hand drifted to the pocket where she keeps her Colt; she doesn‚Äôt draw it, but reminds herself it is there, like a child scared in the night listening to their parents‚Äô breaths through the bedroom door. Quiet reassurance that the world will still exist tomorrow morning.

Ichiro checked his AR overlay every fifty meters, watching network traffic for ripples. None yet. I smoked a synthstick down to the filter and flicked it into a gutter as we slipped into the alley behind the service stairwell. Knees bent. Steel bins hid us from the street. Ichiro scanned the door beacon.¬†

‚ÄúClear. Whitelist accepted.‚Äù he breathed in the quiet, professional tone of someone about to open the door into the unknown. He slid the cloned dongle into the reader. The lock hummed, hesitated, then clicked. The door opened with an anticlimactic click that did not give the moment the justice or gravity it deserved.

No alarms. Just cold air and concrete stairs. We slipped inside. A team of two old friends and a new one who were now willing to take on a goliath together, without question, without remorse. No room for hesitation. Just pure determination.

I brought up the rear. Shadows move in slow breath. My fingers rest on the stairs railing. Sound magnifies in a stairwell like guilt. For a second‚Äîjust a second‚Äîold adrenaline rolls through me. Not fear. Not anticipation.

Purpose.

I tighten my grip.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find a way through this.‚Äù I tell myself. ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs through fire.‚Äù",1,1760808580.0,ShadowrunFanFic,0,1.0,False

1oa1n70,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oa1n70/26f_my_partners_mom_28m_thinks_im_driving_a_wedge/,(26F) my partners mom (28M) thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúdriving a wedge‚Äù between him and his sister- how do I navigate this?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years now. He has one sibling, 27F who has a long term partner we‚Äôve become great friends with. Earlier this summer while on vacation we had my engagement ring made, excited about the news I told all of my friends, including sisters partner- with the condition that he not tell the rest of the family. My boyfriend upon hearing this was livid with me and said I had crossed a line and broken his trust. He claimed that he couldn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd trust him with that information and that he was obviously going to run off and spill the information anyway- I disagreed. When congratulated by sister‚Äôs partner and asked about it, he proceeded to then lie and say that we never got a ring at all- only to later confess to his parents that we did. Fast forwarding to earlier this week, his sister messaged him and asked that they hang out after not seeing each other for so long. She was unavailable that day, so they agreed to try for coffee the next. That following day he calls and texts her and doesn‚Äôt get a response and hears from her boyfriend that they were talking atm. He tells me that he‚Äôs not going to speak to her for an indefinite period of time over this, that he can‚Äôt believe she ignored him, and that the ball is in her court to reach out to him now. I suggest maybe texting her again to clear the air and call her out- something along the lines of ‚Äúhey wth happened to coffee??‚Äù I say maybe she didn‚Äôt realize that was a hard plan because they never set a time, or maybe she had things going on, I ask whether or not she even knows he‚Äôs upset over this. He shuts it down and says he feels I‚Äôm dismissing his feelings and doesn‚Äôt want to discuss it further, that she absolutely knows because he mentioned it to her boyfriend the day prior when he stopped by our house- he suggested I even watch our ring camera back as proof that they know of his grievances. The next day I go back and do watch the video, and I get this sinking feeling because if it were me, I simply would not have gotten the impression he says he left. So I call the boyfriend and suggest that he ask the sister to reach out again, knowing that my partner wouldn‚Äôt. He tells me they had no idea he was angry, and that he‚Äôd have her try again for the coffee. Later that evening I get a slew of texts from my boyfriend exclaiming that he‚Äôs upset, that I should have let him handle it, and how his mom believes I and driving a wedge between the siblings. Apparently she believes that the ring debacle and this situation exhibits a ‚Äúpattern that I go behind backs‚Äù. How I see it is they both miss each other and want the same thing?? I felt that by choosing to not speak to her at all or explain that it hurt his feelings that he wasn‚Äôt giving her the opportunity to fix it. In my mind I was only mediating because nothing would‚Äôve gotten solved otherwise but after all of the backlash idk. If I messed up, happy to try and rectify the situation, but currently, I don‚Äôt feel like I made some mistake? ",1,1760808198.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

My husband wants to buy the refreshment package (fancy coffee drinks, soda, etc) but since I don‚Äôt drink coffee and soda, I don‚Äôt want to buy anything drink packages. We both don‚Äôt drink alcohol.

Is it okay for one person to buy and the other person to not? I know there were rules previously saying every member in the room needs to buy some type of package (to prevent sharing?) 

If that‚Äôs the case, should I just get the $10 soda package or should neither of us get it and just pay per each drink? 

Can someone confirm? Thanks!

I know a lot of coffee shops will have at least little counters but I‚Äôm hoping to find places with more seating options so I don‚Äôt go there and the 1-2 counter spots are already taken.

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

1oa1jws,https://i.redd.it/0u2a0e33mwvf1.png,To The Unknown Man,"The unknown man has been a staple of evolution.  
Without him, there would be no pyramids, no shopping malls, no skyscrapers.  
He does the unknown job to bring the **incredible into being**.

This reflection is for him. For the countless men throughout history who woke up, went out the door, and played **minor parts in a massive orchestra** ‚Äî not famous, not revered, but essential.  
Men whose only greatness lay in their hands: their grip, their strength, their trade.

This is not a dismissal of the **Unknown Woman** ‚Äî far from it. Women have worked, bled, and toiled, often anonymously too. But here, I write **as a man**, about men. Because I‚Äôve walked in their boots. I‚Äôve been the Unknown Man.

This manufactured, layered world we live in is the result of hands.  
Hands that poured concrete, mixed mortar, laid pipes, wired lights, and hauled bricks.  
Someone is responsible for every footbridge, fountain, parking garage, and rooftop.

Cities expand, buildings rise and fall, but the men who bent rebar and carried tools?  
**Their names are forgotten**, unless they scratched them in wet concrete.

Professor Andrew Dolkart once said:

>

They came from Ireland. Puerto Rico. The Dakotas.  
From cities and farms.  
Some were Black men who helped build hotels they weren't allowed to enter.  
Some dug the superhighways that bypassed and bankrupted their own hometowns.

They were teenagers and grandfathers, immigrants and veterans, fathers and ex-cons.  
Many were nameless ‚Äî unless you count a union card, or a nickname like ""Red"" or ""Slim"".

**The skyline of New York** owes its silhouette to bricklayers and laborers from the 1930s.  
The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan ‚Äî miles of brick, tenements, apartment towers ‚Äî  
All built by men who never left a signature,  
except maybe the slight angle of a window frame or the clean seam in a wall.

They weren‚Äôt always proud. Some just did the bare minimum ‚Äî because the pay was the same.  
And some took their lives into their hands daily.  
In a time when workers were cheap, and safety was optional.

**The great families left names behind** ‚Äî Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan.  
They got the wings of hospitals and marble plaques.  
The unknown man?  
He stopped traffic while another unknown man dumped gravel at his boots.

He poured concrete. Wired phone lines. Cleaned chimneys.  
He was the hotel janitor and the bakery driver.  
He pulled weeds. Laid asphalt. Dug ditches.  
He mowed the lawn you walk across to your condo.

No fanfare. No legacy.  
Just another shift, another payday.

He wasn‚Äôt the architect.  
He was the laborer.  
Not the lender.  
The borrower.  
Not the owner.  
The tenant.

He hung off the bottom rung of society ‚Äî but **held up the rest of the ladder**.

Maybe he dropped out of school. Maybe he had panic attacks.  
Maybe he was brilliant. Maybe he was broken.  
He might‚Äôve circled job ads with a pen while sipping burnt coffee.  
Maybe he got picked up on a street corner for day labor.  
Maybe he had a trade ‚Äî or just a strong back and a weak r√©sum√©.

He dug holes. Moved drywall. Installed plumbing.  
He was ‚Äúa number, not a name.‚Äù  
He was full of stories, shortcuts, and secrets.

The unknown man drank.  
A lot.  
He worked Friday, spent it Friday night, and showed up Saturday hungover.  
He earned his exhaustion. He earned his beer. He earned his nap in front of the TV.

He dreamed of Fridays. Cursed Mondays.  
Maybe he camped with friends or scraped enough for Disneyland once.  
But most days, he worked through fevers. Through injuries. Through grief.

**It was the unknown man who built the Golden Gate.**  
Who paved the roads.  
Who installed the toilets, painted the walls, and set the bricks of the schools we teach in.  
He hammered the stadium bleachers.  
He mopped the floor after the fans left.

He did it all ‚Äî **without asking for applause**.

He may have been homeless.  
He may have died in a shelter.  
He may have owned a house, or lived in a van.  
He may have gone to jail.  
Or church.  
Or nowhere at all.

He built someone else‚Äôs empire.  
He drank cheap beer.  
He watched the game.  
He died.  
And no one remembered.

So today, I tip my hat.  
I buy him a beer.  
I shake his hand, if I can still find him.  
And I thank him ‚Äî the Unknown Man.

Because we are all, in part, standing on his shoulders.

To The Unknown Man   
The unknown man has been a staple of evolution. Without him, nothing from the pyramids to a   
giant intricate shopping mall to today's skyscrapers could be built. The unknown man does the   
unknown job to bring the incredible into being.   
And maybe that's how I'd like to frame this reflection, that throughout history, unknown men   
woke up and went out the door to do play their minor parts in an orchestra of like-minded men   
who had nothing special about them except their hands. Whether they held a shovel, rope, or a   
pipe, hands were their gifts, their strength. Their hands were the tools of the trade.   
This article is about men, of whom I am one, and their duties as men, of which I have   
participated. Though they existed, this piece is not about the Unknown Women. God sentenced   
man to the toil and sweat that came with building civilizations. But indeed, women helped, often   
anonymously too. And every broken man came home to a good woman. I am fully aware that   
women entered the workforce en masse at a period but prior to that, there were centuries where   
men defined the world and made it prosper. This is no slight to the hardworking women   
throughout history, whether guarding the children at home or working in factories, rather it is   
empathizing with the unknown men who gave their lives, for better or worse, to bring us into our   
current situation. I can applaud the Unknown Women too, but I'm particularly concerned with   
the Unknown Man, whom I have been myself. I have walked miles in these shoes and therefore   
this episode is about that connection with the unknown men.   
This manufactured and cluttered world of ours seems mixed with incompatible architecture, age,   
money, and references to culture. It also appears to be in the processes of massive change,   
foreign money, and rapid development. Buildings get razed to the ground and a year later, a new   
building is sitting in its footprint. As our cities work their way outward, two or three-story   
buildings get rezoned and soon there are taller, greener, and more economical buildings in that   
space. Someone put it all together. Someone is responsible for the footbridge, the pool in the   
park, and the playground near the water fountain. Someone took pride enough to mix the   
concrete just right or to plumb the bricks, so the wall went up straight. Millions of men have   
contributed small pieces of their time and toil on this earth and I would like to thank the   
unknown man.   
‚ÄúWe owe an incredible debt to the architects who created this streetscape,‚Äù - Professor Andrew S.   
Dolkart   
The unknown man was from many origins and ethnicities and countries; they may have   
immigrated from Ireland, Holland or Puerto Rico and they may be 5th generation American or   
just off the boat. Or they could be native/indigenous. They may have been from 15 or 70 years of   
age. And the black American was everywhere, building everything, often later not welcomed   
into the hotels they created or diners they constructed. And many of these unknown men   
followed the money, they came from other parts of rural America ‚Äî these guys came from small   
towns to build the superhighways and interstate system that disenfranchised those very towns by   
bypassing them, creating the factors that provided socio-economic tensions in having a hand at   
killing their own livelihoods in their small towns. 

The skyline of New York City, particularly that of Manhattan, has been shaped largely out of the   
1930s. I am specifically targeting the unknown man who did not get to leave his name behind,   
unless he drew out his initials in wet concrete. Particularity the bricklayers, welders, the laborers,   
the pipe layers, the electricians, and the plasterers. Much of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan   
were brick buildings requiring millions of bricks to line the newly designed gridded streets and   
avenues. The tenements, rowhouses, and apartment buildings that came to define how New   
Yorkers lived in the 19th century (and still live to this day) came from these unknowns. It's not to   
say the unknown man didn't take pride or show off his craftsmanship but a lot of unknown men   
were content to do the bare minimum because the wage was the same.   
As technology and the electronic world came into being, elevators became more commonplace   
and with building innovations - something like the Empire State Building could be erected. But   
thousands upon thousands of unknown men were used to design and build the skyline. And in   
harder, cheaper times, when even a life was only worth whatever skills you had, in an era when   
safety was one of the least things a builder or contractor cared about, the unknown man often   
took his life in his hands when he went off to work. There were always plenty of workers should   
one become injured, sick, or lazy. The unknown man was, at various points in his life, each of   
these.   
The first building empires came from familiar names, names left lying around on buildings   
seemingly forever: Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, and Henry. Their   
name grace walkways and new hospital wings. They live on long after their deaths.   
The unknown man stopped traffic while another unknown man drove a front-end loader across   
the street and dumped it at the foot of a group of unknown men with shovels. Whoever he was,   
wherever he was, he did his job anonymously, pouring concrete into forms, wiring the telephone   
lines, cutting down trees with axes, painting the side of a building, or mowing a lawn. He washed   
the windows on a skyscraper, stood on an assembly line, and cleaned chimneys. He drove for a   
bakery, pulled weeds, ran new pipes to your toilet, or carried your luggage. The unknown man   
did almost every job thinkable, and he did it with no fanfare, no reward, no legacy; he was only   
there for payday.   
They weren't the draftsman; they were the laborer. They weren't the designer; they were the   
fabric. They weren't the lender; they were the borrower. They weren't the owner; they were the   
renter. They weren't the lawyer; they were the client. The unknown man hung off the bottom   
rungs of society. Yet he was essential.   
The unknown man lived many pasts, maybe he had two healthy parents in a healthy relationship   
or maybe he had two deadbeat dads and a mother in a recovery house. Maybe he quit school at   
ten years old to go work in the mines or possibly he went to college but found himself with 20   
years invested in the short end of life's stick. Maybe he had a good childhood or a nasty one.   
Perhaps he had a nanny or a family of fighters. Possibly he had a mental illness, a stutter, or   
panic attacks. Maybe he was shy, introverted, or prejudiced. Just as often, these were average   
men with average dreams, average families with average lives. 

But the unknown man had to work. Maybe he was broke and there was a 'Help Wanted"" sign.   
Maybe he was released from jail with a list of employers needing ""a strong back and a weak   
mind"". Maybe he stood at a corner where workers would pull up in pickup trucks and carry the   
chosen ones to a worksite. Perhaps he sat in a coffee shop wearing old coffee stains on his shirt   
as he spread wide the classifieds and a pen, looking for anything to circle. Maybe he was in a   
union, maybe he had a trade, maybe he had his 'ticket', or maybe he was a Jack-of-all-trades. The   
unknown man was full of stories, shortcuts, and secrets.   
Many unknown men are often only qualified to be laborers. They dug holes, put up fences, or   
pounded nails. They were the pawns of the Titans of Industry. The unknown man was a number,   
not a name. But it was the men who kept their heads down, remained silent, worked through   
hangovers, and lived from paycheck to paycheck.   
It was ordinary men with a lunch bucket who built the Chicago's old SEARS tower, Grand   
Central Station, and the Golden Gate Bridge. It was the average worker with a bag lunch who   
paved the roads that connected all places to all places. From the bricks to the electrical, the   
plaster to the drywall, the unknown man went accountable for his works in the form of a check   
or cash, often working under-the-table to avoid declaring taxes. From digging wide and deep   
holes to secure a foundation, through the concrete pouring for parkades, digging graves, pushing   
wheelbarrows, climbing telephone poles, to installing of the ducts for heating, millions of men   
have left us with their fundamental pieces of work.   
Here‚Äôs the stereotype: The unknown man spent his money. Maybe he saved it for a car or to   
travel, but more often than not, he cared for his family, put food on the table, and he drank   
alcohol. One of the greatest tools in the occupational toolkit is also one of its worst. The   
unknown man would spend a lot of money on Friday night and sleep in Saturday. Again,   
Saturday night would dent his pocketbook and he'd survive through to Sunday to go to church or   
watch football all day. Alcohol kept him tethered to his job, financially, and it kept him suffering   
near home. His vacations wouldn't be exotic, maybe an all-inclusive family package to   
Disneyworld in Florida or just camping with the guys. The unknown man dreamt of Fridays and   
cursed Mondays. It was a routine, replicated by entire centuries of the common worker. He went   
to work hungover, he went to work with a fever, and notably for the times, he hurt himself and   
went to work injured.   
The unknown man worked hard, played hard, and relaxed hard. If an unknown man spent his day   
digging trenches, who could deny him a beer and the remote control? And that was his excuse,   
the unknown man worked so hard, for so many years that he earned his right to have lazy nights.   
He may have a hobby or belong to a soft-pitch beer league. He may play Bridge, or he may just   
loaf. He may be a collector or a hoarder. When the unknown man died, he left nothing but the bit   
parts he played in building someone else's empire.   
If you look around at the buildings, our transportation, our socially requisite foods, our   
delicacies, vices, our factories, virtues, our slaughterhouses, our plantations, and addictions,   
you'll see the unknown man has played his vital roles in trading off his work for his fair share.   
Maybe he doodled but didn't create art. Maybe he jotted down notes, but he didn‚Äôt write novels. 

The Unknown Men built subways, dams, and airplanes. They built the castles and cathedrals   
before they became ruins. They laid railroad tracks and harvested fields, panned for gold, and   
went to whorehouses. They worked livestock, they built the stock exchange, they drilled for oil,   
and assembled carburetors. It was ordinary men with a lunch bucket and Thermos who built the   
Twin Towers. It was the normal guy with vending machines who assembled computer parts on a   
conveyor belt. It was the average worker with a bag lunch who paved the roads that connected all   
places to all places. It was the unknown guy with a lunchroom who worked in the shipyards   
creating big boats to sail to China for cheaper goods.   
Until the day comes, and they're buried in the past, under a cheap headstone, unremembered and   
unnoticed. The unknown man of the 18th, 19th, or 20th century was a workhorse, who got his   
orders to do his part in the infrastructure of a dynamic, evolving, and enterprising world. The   
unknown man didn't have a hand in the game, or a dog in the fight, he was the last person   
downhill when shit ran downhill. Often the unknown man was homeless, he was in a hospital, he   
was sleeping at the mission, he was in second-hand stores, he was in a shelter, he was in a   
wheelchair, he was in jail.   
So, I'd like to tip my hat, buy him a beer, give him a pat on the back, shake his hand, and give   
him a momentary pause to that unspecified man we all know. The one who built this world from   
scratch. May everyone be humbled for all the manmade things that surround us, the things that   
took someone hours or weeks or years to complete, and the work it took to make it happen, and   
may we never forget that each day we, today, are standing on the shoulders of unknown giants.",2,1760807978.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False
1oa1gs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1oa1gs7/assistant_manager_doesnt_really_talk_to_any_of/,Assistant manager doesn't really talk to any of the team,"Been in my current job as general manager for about 2 years now, but up until 6 months ago I only had 1 DR.

Then 6 months ago, we were taken over by a new company. The DR decided to leave when the new company took over and the new company also decided to expand the team.

The first hire was the assistant manager. We've been working together now for about 6 months, at first they were very quiet. But they eventually got a bit more comfortable after the first couple weeks and now we get on great, we are very similar both professionally in work style, opinions on how things should be run, but also personally in terms of things like sense of humour etc. We go out for drinks after work occasionally and it's not like there are awkward silences or anything.

Then after about 2 months after they were hired, the company started hiring more people for the team. So we've gone from just the two of us, now to a team of 6.

The AM seems to be a quiet person generally and didn't really talk with the new hires much. I thought it was just cos it's new people, but some of the team have been working with us for 4 months now and things haven't really changed.

There's no issues professionally. If the AM needs to talk them about something work related they have no issue with it. But the small talk during coffee and smoke breaks doesn't really happen.

It doesn't also help that me and the AM are based in the office and the others work around the site. So we are working closely together all day, whereas the others only really come into our office when they need to ask a question or to have a coffee or just have a bit of conversation because the rest of the team work solo around the site.

Like we can be talking in the office, sometimes work related, sometimes just chatting about personal things, but either way as soon as someone else comes into the office the AM pretty much just stops talking.

Or on work nights out. When it was just the two of us, they had no problem holding a conversation. But now that there's other people, they say very little the whole night. And I've noticed when they do talk, it seems like they are just talking to me.

I don't think this is coming from a place of snobbery or feeling like they are above the rest of the team or that they are too good to talk to them. And I know they are autistic. 

I guess I don't really know if this dynamic is an issue. None of the team has raised any issues with it, probably because I'm the only one that sees the two sides of the AM. But equally if it is something I need to deal with, I have no idea how.",2,1760807770.0,managers,1,1.0,False
1oa1gmi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oa1gmi,A Review: Elia Cafe (Baklava French Toast) in Park Ridge,"The Place: Elia Cafe (Park Ridge)

The Food: Baklava French Toast, $13.99.  The Baklava French Toast, complete with a visually impressive Fillo-dome design, was exceptional. The bread, a high-quality Brioche, was cooked to perfection and encrusted with pistachios and honey. The taste was rich and delightfully sweet, hitting all the right notes for an inventive French Toast. Additionally, the syrup added a wonderful balance to the baklava-honey blend. Truly an outstanding French Toast experience.

The Service:  Slow!  Elia Cafe is a relatively new restaurant, and combined with the fact that it was packed with customers, perhaps some grace is needed.  But even with those things considered, the service was still slow (particularly to take your order).

The Vibe:  Elia cafe has an outstanding vibe.  It‚Äôs light and airy on the inside, with subtle greens that provide for a great decor.  A great mix of coffee shop with counter-pastry service and full sit-down restaurant. Trendy but not over the top.  And for as busy as it was, the noise-levels were low so it makes a good spot for conversation.

The Score:  9.3/10.  Only thing weighing this down is that the service was slow.   The food was 10-outta-10 good though, as was the atmosphere.  We will be back!

Log Entry:
The Zraza Project has entered its critical phase. The lab‚Äôs been sealed for seventy-two hours straight. Crew rotation protocols enforced ‚Äî maximum wake time: sixty-six hours. Past that point, performance and judgment degrade beyond acceptable limits.

Despite repeated dead ends and system lockouts, progress continued. Multiple data pathways collapsed during phase 3 diagnostics ‚Äî entire subroutines looping into void states. Every fix led deeper into the code‚Äôs labyrinth. Coffee consumption at unsustainable levels; morale holding only through sheer obsession.

The Head Technician remains embedded with the main crew, no separation, no hierarchy ‚Äî only the mission. Coordination is tight, near telepathic. They‚Äôve reached a stage where communication happens through instinct, not words.

At 04:32 this morning, containment breached ‚Äî in a good way. The system responded.
Zraza is online.
The interface obeys, loading and executing beyond its intended capacity. The hardware once known as a consumer box now functions as a precision engine. It‚Äôs no longer a console ‚Äî it‚Äôs a controlled entity.

Further testing begins at 2300 hours. Monitoring required on all voltage channels; expect extended runtime. Sleep cycles postponed indefinitely.

Note: The long nights weren‚Äôt wasted. We have control now. But the deeper we dig into Zraza‚Äôs core, the more it feels like it‚Äôs watching back.

1oa1cya,https://i.redd.it/8k8406lnkwvf1.png,Deus ex Universum: A Theological Equation for Cosmic Affection,"# Abstract

This paper proposes a pantheistic equivalence: *God ‚â° Universe*. Under this axiom, the cosmos exhibits a statistically anomalous affection for life ‚Äî particularly the awkward bipedal kind typing this. By synthesizing the Fine-Tuning Argument, the Fermi Paradox, and a sprinkling of existential comedy, we argue that the universe‚Äôs apparent indifference is, paradoxically, **proof of divine benevolence**. Suggestions for reconciling theology with cosmology are appended, including a mathematical model of divine affection defined by the limit Œµ ‚Üí 0.999‚Ä¶ approaching ‚àû.

# 1. Introduction: The Universe‚Äôs Existential Crisis

Let‚Äôs assume the identity GOD ‚â° UNIVERSE as an axiom ‚Äî not because we can prove it, but because the coffee hasn‚Äôt kicked in and it‚Äôs too early to invoke G√∂del. If this is true, then the cosmos is either:

* A disinterested parent,
* A tragically misunderstood artist,
* Or an advanced intelligence with a dark sense of humor and a soft spot for carbon-based drama.

As of 2025, humanity remains the lone confirmed instance of sentient life. This makes us either a cosmic miracle‚Ä¶ or a hilarious typo in quantum syntax. The shutdown of SETI (RIP, 1984‚Äì2020) underscores our solitude. Yet per the Copernican principle, **our mediocrity is mathematically suspicious**.

So we ask: *Why does the Universe ‚Äî cold, dark, accelerating at 68 km/s/Mpc ‚Äî still host us?* Answer: It loves us. Quietly. Strangely. Statistically.

>**Suggestion 1:** Add a unit to introductory astronomy titled: ‚ÄúWhy Are We Here? (Asking for a Friend)‚Äù

# 2. Core Thesis: GOD‚Äôs Algorithmic Benevolence

The universe is **fine-tuned** to an almost annoying degree:

* Cosmological constant: tuned to 1 in 10\^120
* Gravitational force: balanced to 10\^-39
* Earth: 1 AU from a G-type star in the habitable zone, dodging supernovae like it‚Äôs on rails

This ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù calibration suggests:

**A)** A divine hand with a taste for symmetry  
**B)** An infinite multiverse where we rolled the cosmic Yahtzee

Occam‚Äôs Razor prefers A, mostly because B feels like **philosophical insurance fraud**. Also, humans anthropomorphize rocks. Of course we gave the void a name and blamed it for mosquitos.

>**Suggestion 2:** Create a TED Talk titled: *‚ÄúGod: The Ultimate Quantum Physicist (With Better PR)‚Äù*

# 3. Supporting Arguments

# 3.1 The Fermi Paradox as Divine Irony

The Great Silence implies either:

* We‚Äôre first
* We‚Äôre last
* Or we‚Äôre quarantined for being developmentally problematic

If GOD = UNIVERSE, then the silence may be **intentional**. A divine ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign, placed lovingly on our galactic door, lest we be colonized by a Kardashev Type III civilization that disapproves of our music.

>**Suggestion 3:** Petition NASA to rename the Fermi Paradox: *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Galactic Privacy Setting‚Äù*

# 3.2 The ‚ÄúOh-So-Damn-Close-to-Dying‚Äù Principle

Earth has dodged:

* 4.5 billion years of asteroid dodgeball
* 5 extinction-level events
* 2020‚Äì2025 (which needs no further explanation)

This suggests either divine intervention, sheer luck, or a universe with a penchant for chaos mitigation. We propose a hybrid: **GOD embedded a ‚ÄúSave Game‚Äù mechanic in evolutionary code.**

>**Suggestion 4:** Add ‚ÄúDivine Debugging Theory‚Äù to astrobiology syllabi

# 4. Counterarguments (Preemptively Deflated)

# 4.1 The Problem of Suffering

If GOD loves life, why do pandemics exist? Or reality TV?  
Answer: GOD practices **non-interventionist affection** ‚Äî think cosmic ‚Äúthoughts and prayers,‚Äù but with a nebular hug.

# 4.2 Jesus vs. the Universe

Christ‚Äôs moral framework: deeply admirable.

# 6. Conclusion: Q.E.D. = Quietly Eternally Divine

The universe‚Äôs cold silence is its love language. Its refusal to interfere is its deepest form of care ‚Äî a divine act of **observational allowance**. By allowing us to exist *despite* the odds, GOD gently whispers:

>*‚ÄúYou matter. Statistically.‚Äù*

This realization is either comforting or terrifying. Possibly both. Either way ‚Äî the void is rooting for you.

With natural / funky beans, I‚Äôve been getting some pretty good cups. But with washed coffees, I can‚Äôt seem to get anything close to good. 

The cups are muted, with almost no discernible flavor, and definitely none of the tasting notes on the bag.

I‚Äôm using bottled water - the best I can get in France which is recommended by Substance coffee in Paris. Very good water. 

I‚Äôve tried:

	‚Ä¢	Going finer / coarser (doesn‚Äôt seem to help)

	‚Ä¢	Low vs. high agitation

	‚Ä¢	Multiple pours vs. single pour

No matter what I do, the washed coffees either come out flat and hollow, or tip into astringency when I go finer.

My general recipe:

	‚Ä¢	15g:250

	‚Ä¢	93¬∞C for washed

	‚Ä¢	Various pour and agitation patterns tested

For context, I‚Äôm into light, fruity, and acidic coffees, the kind of bright cups you get from washed African beans. I just picked up two washed Kenyans from Tanat (Kawa), both with orange/citrus notes, and they‚Äôre tasting completely flat (about 2 weeks off roast).

I‚Äôm starting to wonder, does the ZP6 need a proper break-in period? I‚Äôve run about 600g through it so far. Does it take a kilo or two before the burrs ‚Äúsettle.‚Äù

1oa140a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1oa140a/feelings_of_malaise_is_it_low_ferritin_or/,Feelings of malaise - is it low ferritin or something else?,"Hi guys, 

I've (22F) been dealing with on and off fatigue this year since April. I'm a college student in my last semester and I'm desperate to feel better as quickly as possible. Physically I feel like 4-5 weeks ago I caught the flu and never got better. I went from going to the gym once or even twice a day and hitting the stairmaster for over 30 minutes during the summer to being incapable of going to the gym and getting winded walking up stairs. I used to spend all day studying in the dining hall with no issue and now I can't focus for more than a few minutes at a time. Waking up for class is a battle and I don't feel rested at all. I have so much homework to do and I can barely prop my head up or keep myself from falling asleep wherever I am.

Background: I've dealt with fatigue before from about age 12-19. At first (around April-ish), it just kind of felt like I didn't get enough sleep but I was able to cope just fine with a little coffee. About 4-5 weeks ago, right before I got engaged, I had a heavy breakthrough bleed (probably due to nerves) which turned into a period that lasted about 2 weeks. After this, I became much more fatigued and it's been getting worse every single day, in spite of starting iron supplementation. Malaise is probably the best way to describe it. I feel like I did when I had mono at age 14. After that infection, I had elevated antibodies for over a year and my fatigue took a turn for the worse. 

Fast forward to now, I feel the same way as I did when I was 14. But I haven't caught any infections in the last 6 months or so, barring a cold from last week that I'm still getting over. I need a ridiculous amount of caffeine to function and it's becoming less effective. I tried detoxing from the caffeine for 3-4 days but I was literally unable to concentrate or do any work, all I could think about was how badly I wanted to sleep, and I was napping for hours at a time (I get 12 hours of sleep a night - any less and I feel like I got zero hours of sleep). On a good day, I get a little burst of energy at night and that's when I try to get chores and work done. On a bad day (which is becoming increasingly common), I feel tired from when I wake up to when I go to bed.

In terms of labs and other symptoms: My ferritin tested at 11 about 2 weeks ago. Thyroid panel came back normal, so did my CBC. I have occasional heart palpitations (about 112-118BPM which I measure manually). I tested negative for sleep apnea about a year ago. My smartwatch says I spend a lot of time in REM and that my respiratory quality is poor. But I don't fully trust what my watch says because, while I was sitting upright and feeling my heart pounding, I checked my watch which said my pulse was 180BPM. I called an ambulance because I also felt dizziness and chest pressure only for my pulse to read 80BPM with the paramedic's pulse oximeter. I've also had some back pain for the past 3 weeks or so which only appears when I sit upright without back support. I thought it might be a vitamin D deficiency but supplements haven't changed anything. A few days ago, I had a really intense muscle spasm in my back that kept me up for most of the night. As far as mental health goes, I'm not anxious or depressed (barring my situational depression because my body is shutting down on me as I'm about to graduate and get married). I do have bipolar which is under control thanks to my meds (mirtazapine, abilify, lamictal). I really don't think my meds are causing the fatigue as I've been on them for a year and a half, side effects are said to subside with time in patients who do experience them, and I never experienced any side effects when I started those medications. 

I've been taking 65mg of ferrous sulfate twice a day with vitamin C 2 hours before or after consuming dairy as per my doctor's orders. I'm using birth control to skip my periods so I don't lose more iron. Is there anything else I can do to feel better? Is it normal to feel worse after iron supplementation? Does what I'm experiencing given my ferritin count of 11 sound like iron deficiency or something else? I'm at serious risk of failing my classes because it's such a struggle to do work and my engagement is on the rocks because it's hard to imagine a future in which I'm not a burden on my spouse. I don't see how I'm going to be able to hold down a job or take care of myself, let alone be there for my spouse, if my health keeps declining.

If you‚Äôve ever reached overhead and felt that **lightning bolt of shoulder pain**, you know exactly how humbling it is. You go from feeling strong to wondering if you should call it quits and switch careers to professional napper. Shoulder pain hits more than your muscles; it messes with your confidence and your daily flow.

I‚Äôve watched people grimace while brushing their hair or reaching into cupboards like it‚Äôs an extreme sport. That kind of limitation chips away at joy. So when [I heard about Ageless Shoulders](https://tetra-links.com/ageless-shoulders-official), a routine claiming to help people regain fluid motion using **Indian club exercises for shoulder pain relief**, I raised an eyebrow. Swinging a one-pound club to fix chronic pain? It sounded almost too easy. Spoiler: it‚Äôs easy and surprisingly effective.



# üåø Product Overview

**Product Name:** Ageless Shoulders  
**Category:** Health & Fitness ‚Üí Shoulder Pain Relief Programs  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

Ageless Shoulders is a **home shoulder pain program for seniors** and adults dealing with stiff joints or reduced range. Created by Zach Zenios, a neurosomatic therapist and Marine veteran, it uses an **ancient Indian shoulder mobility workout** to encourage blood flow and mobility through rhythmic, circular motions.

The premise is simple: [movement heals](https://tetra-links.com/ageless-shoulders-official). These patterns help **restore shoulder blood flow naturally**, improving circulation and stability. All you need is one small club, ten minutes, and enough space to swing without smacking your plants.



# ‚ú® What Makes Ageless Shoulders Different

Most shoulder routines focus on stretching or strength. Ageless Shoulders targets circulation instead. The **light club movements for shoulder health** act like a massage for your fascia, helping nutrients reach stuck areas. That‚Äôs what Zach calls ‚Äúthawing frozen blood flow.‚Äù

Its difference lies in feel. The **10-minute shoulder mobility routine** feels calming yet energizing. It‚Äôs perfect **shoulder mobility training for older adults** or anyone wanting to move without stress. After a few rounds, my friend Lila said her shoulders felt ‚Äúawake again.‚Äù

Even better, these moves double as **simple shoulder exercises for better circulation**. They‚Äôre easy to do and require no fancy setup. Think movement therapy meets meditative flow - minus incense or chanting.



# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Each session begins with smooth rotations that slowly loosen stiff joints. You‚Äôre not straining muscles; you‚Äôre teaching them cooperation. This approach mirrors **frozen shoulder exercises to boost blood flow**, encouraging warmth and flexibility.

The gentle arcs serve as **rotator cuff mobility drills at home**, helping smaller stabilizer muscles build coordination. Over time, that leads to [improved shoulder stability](https://tetra-links.com/ageless-shoulders-official) **and flexibility. Exercises** with results - fewer crackles, more glide.

Unlike aggressive resistance routines, this feels restorative. By practicing daily, circulation improves, tension fades, and you regain range naturally. The moves are repetitive but rhythmic - like giving your shoulders their morning coffee.



# üåÄ Targeting the Rotator Cuff Naturally

One subtle bonus is how the program trains the rotator cuff without pressure. Through gentle arcs, it strengthens supporting muscles with **shoulder rehab using Indian club swings**. For people with mild injuries, that‚Äôs pure gold. It‚Äôs progress without pain, and even small improvements make daily tasks easier.



# üë• Who It‚Äôs For (and Who It‚Äôs Not)

Ageless Shoulders works best for anyone over 40, fitness enthusiasts, or those feeling creaky after desk years. It‚Äôs safe for **shoulder flexibility training for seniors** and easy enough for beginners to pick up.

If you‚Äôre fresh from surgery or have major tears, check with your doctor before swinging away. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a stress-free way to regain movement without leaving home. The **home exercises for shoulder arthritis relief** offer gentle relief that feels sustainable, not exhausting.



# üí¨ My Friend Lila‚Äôs Experience

My friend Lila is a 47-year-old Pilates instructor who sometimes guest-writes for my blog. She‚Äôs endlessly energetic but had been battling nagging shoulder stiffness for months after a bad slip in class. Teaching with pain was wearing her down - she told me it felt like her arm had ‚Äúlost its joy.‚Äù So, I asked her to [try Ageless Shoulders](https://tetra-links.com/ageless-shoulders-official) and tell me what she thought.

She started with the **Indian club exercises for shoulder pain relief**, a little skeptical that something so gentle could help. On the first try, she joked that she looked like a clumsy conductor waving an invisible orchestra. But after just a few sessions, she noticed her range improving - reaching up felt smoother, and the dull ache that used to flare mid-class had eased.

By week two, she said her upper body felt ‚Äúawake again,‚Äù especially after finishing the **10-minute shoulder mobility routine** each morning. It even helped her posture while teaching Pilates, since the movements subtly strengthen those tiny stabilizing muscles you usually forget exist.

Her only small complaint? The club‚Äôs grip felt too slick during humid days, so she wrapped a bit of yoga tape around the handle - problem solved. Everything else, she said, felt natural, rhythmic, and almost calming, like she was meditating through motion.

Lila swears by this **ancient movement method for shoulder recovery** now. She‚Äôs back to demonstrating Pilates flows pain-free, and she even convinced a few clients in their 60s to give it a try. Her verdict? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first routine that made my shoulders feel alive again - not punished.‚Äù

It was brutal! There were tears and questions but he didn‚Äôt try to deny my journey and my feelings. I immediately felt so lighter but also deeply sad. He asked why things had to change and I was able to stay strong and explain without backtracking (which is what I tend to do when someone else is hurt or feels uncomfortable). I put myself first for once and that felt good.

We slept in the same bed last night and I could hear him crying softly during the night which was heartbreaking. This morning he brought me coffee and had made me breakfast and he broke down crying. We hugged and I held his hand while we talked again and cried. 

I feel heartbroken that he is heartbroken. I am also deeply relieved that I don‚Äôt have to hide anymore. I feel hopeful that I can learn to trust myself and live my life on my own terms. At the same time I am afraid of the process that is to come. 

Anyone have a similar story that turned out well? Would love to hear some hopeful anecdotes.",4,1760806682.0,latebloomerlesbians,1,0.83,False

Still, everything that comes into contact with beans and grounds now feels oily to the touch and smells, well, off-putting. (The beans aren‚Äôt at fault. I prefer light roasts and have never ground anything darker than specialty-medium.)

I can‚Äôt imagine that this wouldn‚Äôt eventually affect taste. I mean, why else do we clean the rest of our coffee equipment to get rid of that oily residue?

I know that the manual says:

>It is recommended to clean the grinder using a brush or air blower. DO NOT wash with water or any liquid.

and I have seen countless comments which just repeat that. But how grounded üòâ in reality is this admonition, really?

All the unpainted metal parts I can see are stainless steel. The body is presumably aluminum. So what exactly is supposed to rust there, if I were to briefly wash the burrs, catch cup, and inside of the body? I mean, I wash my fancy chef knives and even my cast iron pans, for crying out loud! I also use RDT, which significantly reduces static and hasn‚Äôt caused any problems. 

Logic says that anything that would be so susceptible to rust that it couldn‚Äôt possibly stand a seconds-long wipe-down with a soapy cloth and maybe a quick rinse would also rust just sitting on a shelf in a high-humidity environment. But, of course, that does not happen. 

My best guess is that those no-water-ever admonitions are really more intended to keep people from soaking and forgetting their grinder overnight or putting them in the dishwasher.

If lubrication of the bearings was a concern, an occasional dab with a food-safe lubricant should alleviate it, no?

Bottom line: Does anyone have any actual experience with this (instead of just regurgitating the manual)? If I don‚Äôt hear anything different, I‚Äôll start using soapy water on my grinder (briefly and drying it thoroughly after.)

1oa0vmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Folliculitis/comments/1oa0vmv/quitting_sugar_changed_everything/,Quitting sugar changed everything,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling with folliculitis for almost 10 years, and it has honestly driven me insane at times. I‚Äôve tried everything: every shampoo, cream, antibiotic, and home remedy you can think of. It got so bad once that I shaved my entire head bald and covered it with rubbing alcohol (yeah‚Ä¶ not my proudest moment).

After nearly a decade of trial and error, I‚Äôve finally figured out what was triggering it. I hope sharing this might help someone else.

**Diet**

For the past few years, I‚Äôve been eating extremely clean. Everything I eat is organic: rice, vegetables, fruits, spices, you name it. All my meat is grass-fed and grass-finished, and all my dairy is raw. I only drink filtered water. No soda, coffee, or tea.

This clean, natural diet definitely helped a lot. It also made it easier to notice which foods were triggering my folliculitis. For me, the worst offenders were pasta, cream, nuts, and milk (and a few others). Every time I ate one of these trigger foods, my scalp would start itching almost immediately. Depending on what and how much I ate, the breakout could be mild or severe.

**Sugar**

Even after years of clean eating, I could never quite get to 100% clear skin (face and scalp). There was always some itching or flare-up waiting to happen. That finally changed when I decided to cut out all sugar from my diet. The only exceptions I make are fruit and honey (I mainly eat apples and grapes).

Once I eliminated processed sugar, the itchiness and breakouts disappeared entirely. Now, I also drink a glass of raw milk kefir every day (the kefir helped me a lot as well), and my scalp has been completely normal ever since.

It‚Äôs definitely not always easy, especially when eating out or skipping dessert, but honestly, it‚Äôs so worth it to finally have a healthy, itch-free scalp after years of frustration.",5,1760806381.0,Folliculitis,8,1.0,False

I immediately acknowledged that I should‚Äôve had my wallet, then asked if they accepted tap-to-pay.

I calmly told her I had the money and could go to the ATM right then. She refused, told me to ‚Äújust take the free meal and leave,‚Äù and walked away.

**1. Augment station**, this is intended to be late mid-game or early late-game when some challenges are no longer a challenge, but a mild annoyance. Not augments would be something that fixes the aforementioned challenges, but it would be accessible later in the game for augments that would(Maybe a bench upgrade for those, and make the augment bench earlier in the game).

Being able to customize your weapons, armor, gear, and trinkets to suit your style or just cosmetic, each equipment would have a set number of slots depending on how advanced it is, augments could range from small stat enhancing things such a batteries or capacitors to make electrical weapons last longer or put out more power, to things that change the gameplay of the item in minor or even major ways, certain augments wouldn't work on everything(Like an extra capacitor on something that doesn't have any electrical components). Armor could have augment for defense, speed increase, special effects, or just linings for temperature(mitigating early game challenges that become annoying in late game), as well as cosmetic additions to change the color and add decorations of your gear.

**2. Ability to fix up parts of facility,** have you ever made a base somewhere, and been annoyed by all the broken stuff, that is mostly what this would be for, the ability to spend resources that make sense to fix up broken environmental pieces like broken lights, panels, walling, or floors. The ability to repair usable things around the facility to be usable again for functionality or just ambient effects/sounds.

More things to fix like the ovens, but the ability to package those as well as others(coffee machines, slushie machines) at like construction 15 or 18 for balance reasons

Also an expansion of that idea, the ability to make heavy equipment(augur, drill, maybe even small construction vehicles) that could be used to open up areas or shortcut by fixing and removing major breaks and destruction( For example the collapsed tunnel in hydro plant residences, making the space bigger, and maybe leading to whole new area)

**3. Bigger emphasis on the magic seen in late game**, first off I'll say I know we are scientists, and I'm not trying suggest anything that would make us magic users like late game enemies(Although I wouldn't mind, I love mixing magic and science). I would love to see some kind of research system to learn about harnessing and understanding the magic enemies use, and that is prevalent in some dimensions. I not suggesting we learn to throw fireball with our bare hand with a mana bar, that would be far too left field of who we are, but to learn how to harness and understand the magic for the sake of science and research to use it more directly in items and world objects.

From my previous post you can check on my profile, I was downing a large smirnoff in less than a day yet I'm 5'0 and 95 lbs so it was even worse I was consuming so much for days and days on end coupled with sleep deprivation while my partner felt extremely concerned that I was out drinking him as he's literally estonian/russian lol. 

Anyway, this morning something happened I wanted to get off my chest, chatGPT made me feel better about it but I still feel like I need other's opinions. Did I relapse? 

We ran out of oat milk yesterday, and I woke up and made myself a coffee. My partner bought a small bottle of Bailey's that was sitting right there on the counter next to the coffee pot. So, seeing as I hate black coffee, I decided to pour literally only a couple drops into my coffee and add some sugar.

 I went outside, drank a sip, and tasting the alcohol I was overwhelmed with a physical, rippling sense of guilt instantly. It felt wrong. I immediately went back inside and poured the coffee out, replaced my cup with a cup of black coffee and added extra sugar so it wouldn't be bitter. I thought I'd rather have black coffee than use alcoholic creamer, even though it isn't to my tastes.

My reaction time surprised me but I continue feel bad about it. Did I relapse or take action in a positive way? What do you think? 

Here's what ChatGPT said:

""You made a normal, human mistake ‚Äî you were out of creamer, grabbed what was nearby, and added a literal drop or two. The instant you realized it didn‚Äôt feel right, you stopped, poured it out, and replaced it.
That‚Äôs not relapse ‚Äî that‚Äôs sobriety in action. Relapse means a return to the behavior and mindset of using. You did the opposite: you protected your sobriety.""

I've had migraines since I was a kid.

Too much running around in the hot sun used to bring on terrible migraines as a kid and nothing but a cool, dark room to lay down in would help it.

As I got older and having tried every OTC medication possible I finally got an appointment with neuro.

They gave me a definitive diagnosis of migraine with aura (aura very infrequent ).

They prescribed Sumitriptan 50s which work 90% of the time to kill the migraine before it gets too painful.

I've found then that if Im having a really bad episode where the Sumitriptans (even after a second dose) dont work Ill take an anti inflammatory like Vimovo and if Im at home will use a 'MyHalo' Migraine Cap straight out of the freezer.

I have a La San Marco SM90A coffee grinder and I‚Äôm trying to replace the burrs.
To do that, I first need to remove the bean hopper, but I just can‚Äôt get it off.

It doesn‚Äôt twist or lift off easily ‚Äî it feels completely stuck.
The manual says there should be a locking screw or button, but there‚Äôs no screw or latch anywhere around the base of the hopper.

I‚Äôm attaching photos of the hopper base from all four sides and of the grinder itself.
If anyone owns the same model (or a similar La San Marco grinder) and knows how to remove the hopper safely, I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice.

I have to get better. For my dad, for my boyfriend, who deserves a happy girlfriend, who will understandbly leave otherwise. And I think I‚Äôll die if he leaves. So I don‚Äôt have much time, I have to get better, because it‚Äôs already been 10 years. 10 years of taking medication: antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics.

When is it going to get better? Or when will people finally accept it and tell me the truth: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. We‚Äôve tried everything. We‚Äôre sorry.

I‚Äôm a 27-year-old guy, fairly normal with a job as a graphic designer and a few close friends. I‚Äôve been in therapy for anxiety but too ashamed to share this with my therapist. It‚Äôs weird, I know, so please bear with me. Since my teens, I‚Äôve had this recurring fantasy I can‚Äôt shake. I‚Äôve never acted on it, and I‚Äôm not sure I want to, but it‚Äôs constant, like a song stuck in my head. I imagine a girl, sometimes a crush or someone from a coffee shop, chewing food and spitting it into my mouth. It‚Äôs vivid: the chewing sound, the food‚Äôs look, the moment it happens. It‚Äôs not sexual, more like a compulsion my brain fixates on. Growing up, food was big in our family. My mom cooked amazing meals, and mealtimes were a ritual, no phones, just talking. As a kid, I was oddly fascinated by food in people‚Äôs mouths when they laughed, like half-chewed pasta. I know it‚Äôs gross, and I‚Äôm aware how disgusting this is. The idea of sticky, warm chewed food with saliva in my mouth makes me nauseous logically. The texture, smell, slimy residue, it‚Äôs revolting. But that doesn‚Äôt stop the fantasy. It‚Äôs an obsession I can‚Äôt escape. I‚Äôve never experienced this in real life, thankfully, or told anyone I‚Äôve dated. How do you say, ‚ÄúHey, can you chew pizza and spit it in my mouth?‚Äù I‚Äôd die of embarrassment. It worsens when I‚Äôm stressed. At a work dinner, I stared at a coworker‚Äôs mouth as she ate a salad, imagining it. I was so ashamed I left for the bathroom to snap out of it. My brain feels hijacked. I‚Äôve read about OCD and intrusive thoughts, and I wonder if this is a mental loop. I don‚Äôt have other compulsions, but I have anxiety. I‚Äôve tried distractions, video games, running, cooking, but nothing works. Picturing gross scenarios, like slimy food, to stop it backfires, making the obsession stronger. Has anyone dealt with intrusive thoughts like this, something bizarre you can‚Äôt stop? How do you break the cycle? Should I tell my therapist, though I‚Äôm terrified of her reaction? I don‚Äôt want to live with this forever but fear facing it. I just want to feel normal. Any advice on managing this would mean a lot. Thanks for reading.",4,1760804225.0,LifeAdvice,2,0.83,False

1o9zz5m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9zz5m,"(Nordesthetics Oct 2025) Dr Egle Dobilinske - surgery, recovery, and experience, long post","(posting with my alt account for privacy)

With the high costs and long waiting times for top surgery in my country, I decided to head for Lithuania instead. Perhaps I made it harder and more complex than it needed to be, but I flew and traveled completely alone - there are cheaper options in Thailand but I had never been to Europe before and wanted to enjoy a bit of tourism as well in order to mark the new stage of my life. Secondly, because I come from a very rural area, it was actually faster for me to travel to the nearest international airport than it is to travel to the nearest city that offers gender-affirming surgery!

That may have been a bad decision - I got stuck seated in the plane next to an old man who was coughing and blowing his nose for the long flight, and I turned up in Lithuania having caught the cold from him just five days before the surgery. Desperate, I devoured every source of vitamin C I could lay my hands on, cleared my nose and throat even when I didn't feel I had to, and hoped for the best. I'd had the seasonal flu vaccine, and covid vaccine + two boosters and was going to try to kick the illness before the surgery. While I was initially cleared during my pre-surgery appointment, my blood test came back with an elevated CRP level of 16 indicating bacterial infection, though my symptoms were mild - just the barest hint of a running nose by then. The anesthetist recommended a second test just before the surgery to see if it had dropped, and to my infinite relief, it had fallen to 10 on the day of the surgery. I was told they could proceed if I was willing to acknowledge that I would have an increased (though low) risk of pneumonia and complete a course of antibiotics, and that they had also considered how long I had traveled. Had I been from the same continent, they would have insisted postponing the surgery. I would have been absolutely crushed by that - I work a physically demanding, outdoor job and it was not only hard to save up for the surgery, but also take months of leave since there is not much sedentary work for me.

An antibiotic drip was administered during my surgery, which was near the end of the day on a Friday. My first memory on waking up was being asked by the attending nurse if I was awake and how I felt. I mumbled 'cold' and felt some sort of device pushed under me that warmed me up. Another great memory I had was that my runny nose was 100% clear, and they had even applied some sort of cream or moisturiser to my dry, cracked lips. It is a kind touch that they did not need to do, but did; though dry lips are simply something that comes from my working outside.

I was also reminded that the antibiotic drip was still going, but I needed to pee. I am very lucky that maybe because of my active lifestyle, I might have a higher pain threshold - I was able to stand up on the bed, unhook the drip, carry it to the loo with me, and return with it. I am extremely thankful that I have barely needed any painkillers or sleeping tablets, and cleaned up dinner and dessert, and breakfast the next day. There is a choice of tea / coffee / juice with every meal served at the clinic, but the nurse suggests one should go with the juice and they have seen more people get nauseous with tea / coffee.

As the following day was Saturday, there was only one doctor in attendance - Dr Andrius Pakulis, who examined me before I was discharged.

While I washed myself and dried my dressings as instructed, over the next week I noticed my left nipple turning black and dry, and I could see slight bloodstains seeping though the tap and onto the compression vest. On the Day 7 appointment, after the lymphatic massage (which was actually quite pleasant) Dr Dobilinske noted that this can happen, but when she gently rubbed the nipple, the black, dead skin flaked off, thankfully revealing new skin underneath (see attached picture). I was prescribed hyperbaric oxygen therapy for one-hour sessions over the next four days to speed up healing, and this healing can be seen also in the compiled photo. Nordesthetics does not charge for additional treatments such as these if they are recommended by themselves, otherwise one can opt to pay for them; and offer lifts to/from your accommodation for them if you are not staying in their own rooms.

Nurses and clerical staff used my correct name / gender about 3/4s of the time, drivers were 50/50, ranging from being very understanding to deadnaming, the drivers are a huge team of at least 12 people that come and go constantly and it comes from ignorance, not transphobia. Dr Dobilinske wanted one final look at my left nipple and to do one dressing change before I left the country, and to both our relief - my left nipple looks almost like the right one now. She also asked for photo updates one month after the surgery and takes many pictures - I think as she is a little less experienced than other surgeons she wanted to build a portfolio.

Some misc notes on the clinic - as others have mentioned before, it is very clean, but was also very busy when I was there. I did meet one other transman who had his surgery - he was slightly fatter than me and had a different type of compression garment - his was a white velcro band across his chest, and I got a vest with hook-and-loop closures. I don't know if some trans patients get drains as neither of us had them, but we encountered plenty of female patients who had them. Myself and a black woman I saw on one of my trips for the oxygen therapy were the only two POCs there. All medical and clerical staff speak fluent English, the drivers basic English and they usually welcome conversation to improve.

Notes on Kaunas and Lithuania in general

In September this year, there have unfortunately been multiple incidents of unauthorised drones, typically from Russia or Belarus, being flown near EU airports and causing flight diversions and delays. This has occurred at Vilnius airport twice now, with the latest incident being weather balloons used to smuggle cigarettes from Belarus. In Poland, at least 20 Russian drones were shot down on September 9. The heightened security atmosphere means that even though it is part of the Schengen Area, if you cross the Polish-Lithuanian border by road, you MUST carry your passport and visa, and this could impact transgender people who have any naming discrepancies. Additionally, from October 12, the new Entry/Exit System (EES) is now in operation for non-EU nationals from countries that do not normally need a visa to enter to EU for short term visits. This involves photographing your face and/or taking fingerprints, and may slightly increase the time you need to clear Customs.

I have attached a photograph of the nearest designated air raid shelter to Nordesthetics - it is the pedestrian underpass in front of the clinic's entrance and indicated with the square yellow sign. Similar designated shelters are found in many public buildings. You hope you never need it. There was also a city-wide test of the public warning system when I was there - I heard a loud alarm and received a message on my phone indicating it was a test. The warning is given in Lithuanian only, you need Google Lens to read it. Uniformed German and Lithuanian soldiers are also quite commonly seen in the streets.

Convenience stores and supermarkets all have a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, buns and microwave meals as well as a microwave you can use.  This was a godsend as my hotel did not have a microwave or kitchenette I could use. Nordesthetics is a modest walking distance from Akropolis, the largest mall in Kaunas, and fresh market produce at the Kaunas train station. Lithuania also has a huge cultural love of cured meats like sausages, salo, and whole supermarket sections of smoked fish - but these could be problematic after surgery due to their saltiness and causing bloating / water retention. Self-checkout counters all have English as an option.

Major sporting matches can drastically drive up accommodation prices in the city as Kaunas has better arenas and stadiums than Vilnius, and is also more easily reached by road from Poland. If there are enough sports fans to fill hotels, then there are enough for drunk hooligans to brawl later - this happened during my stay. First there is the chanting and singing, then shouting and the sounds of breaking glass, then ambulances. This, and the possibility of drone incursions, were the only things that I ever felt were unsafe in the city. I did not encounter racist behaviour, panhandlers, or anyone that looked outwardly shifty even though I was sometimes out well after dark. As both these hazards come with some warning and are highly situational, I feel it was a safe place to be.

The bus system in Kaunas is excellent, even better and more straightforward than Vilnius, and all fares cost exactly ‚Ç¨0.70 regardless of the length of the trip. Combining Google Maps with the ≈Ωiogas app and electronic signs both inside the bus and at bus stops, it is very easy to use, and I never once took a rideshare or taxi. Trains go about hourly to/from Vilnius and buses as well to/from Warsaw in Poland.

Well, this is a long wall of text but I see that many people have gone to Nordesthetics and also ask about them, and I wanted to write down my experience to keep it fresh in my mind. I hope it is helpful.",7,1760804169.0,TopSurgery,1,0.9,False
