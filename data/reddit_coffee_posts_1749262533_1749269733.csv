1l5c26n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1l5c26n/extreme_tonsillectomy_guidetextbook/,Extreme Tonsillectomy Guide/Textbook,"I Recently Had a adult tonsillectomy, and a adenoidectomy On The 22nd Of May. Was extremely Nervous, As It is a minor Invasive surgery, That requires General anesthetic. In my Case I Suffered From numerous throat infections every year, Got sick 1-2 times a month, Allergies, and Severe Sleep apnea. My tonsils were so swollen that they were almost touching. When I got to the hospital Everyone Was great and I got IV for before the surgery. Once I was ready to go I was escorted to go into the surgery room and Ill admit it was a bit intimidating But my surgeon tried cracking jokes which lightened the mood a little. The mask got put on, and was told to count down from 100. I got to 97 before I was out LOL. Ill first Explain the do's and don'ts before and after Surgery, and Then go into depth on my experience On recovery. 

Before Surgery: At least a week before stop all medications and supplements (Unless told other by your doctor), Don't Smoke a week before as it can affect the general performance of the anesthetic during surgery. 1 day before surgery do not Eat or drink anything especially Alcohol. No Jewelry, Nail polish, And make Sure you have someone to drive you home after the Surgery. You will be woozy, disoriented and Especially Tired. If possible Please Please Please push For Some narcotics. Some Surgeons are hesitant but Advocate for yourself. Without my Hydrocodone I don't think I would of survived. I was also prescribed Antibiotics, but from my understanding this is not that common. 

After Surgery: After surgery do NOT cough, clear your throat, sneeze, or blow your nose. This can cause bleeds. Most Hemorrhages Occur within the first 24-48 hours after surgery. You will most likely Not want to eat Anything For the first few Days but make SURE you hydrate regularly, so your scabs don't Dry Out Causing more pain or even a bleed. Even when sleeping set An alarm to take Tylenol every 4 hours. Do NOT take ibuprofen, unless completely advised by your doctor, because it is a blood thinner. Avoid Citrus Foods, and salt as these can irritate the throat and increase Pain. Avoid milk as this can Increase phlegm and make it Really difficult to breath. In my case I would occasionally wake up choking on it. No Coffee or smoking For at least 2 weeks after surgery. If prescribed narcotics, Use For days 4-8 As that is when pain is the worst for most individuals. Some advise To take a fiber supplement As constipation is a common occurrence After anesthesia and a liquid diet. Do not do any form of exercise, or physically demanding work for at least 2 weeks. Plan to become a couch potato for 2 weeks. Sleep with your head elevated and sitting up to Reduce inflammation and Help breathing. A must have is a humidifier to keep your throat moisturized while you sleep. This For me was a life saver. Make sure you stay away from dust or anyone sick, as you will be Prone to getting sick and your body needs to prioritizing Healing itself. Occasionally Check your throat with a flashlight to see if you have any light minor bleeding. If so suck on Ice chips, or cold water until it stops. NO straws. Your Voice May sound differently and Taste buds might change. Don't worry this is only temporary. Typically Remaining for only a month. You can also Keep a icepack on your throat to Naturally bring down swelling. For at least a couple days Try to avoid hot showers. Do not use any Mouthwash unless prescribed by doctor and be very gentle when brushing your teeth. 

Foods To eat after Surgery: For me personally I didn't eat anything Until around day 5 but if possible Eat Jell-o, popsicles, Non dairy ice-cream, Cream o rice, Soups, bone broth, Protein shakes, Apple juice, mashed potato's, sweet potato's, ice chips, applesauce. Avoid These: Fruits with seeds as they can get stuck for example strawberries, Nothing pointy/sharp, No super hot beverages. 

Hemorrhages: I was deathly Afraid of getting a hemorrhages, but please know this is Very Very unlikely. The people On this thread put mostly their horror stories. Nobody comes on here to explain their amazing speedy recovery. Please don't be nervous, or frightened. Bleeds occur in 2-5% of people. Bleeds can occur whenever but Mostly either 1-2 days after surgery or 8-10 days after surgery when scabs start to come off. people wonder how do I know if I have one? Oh you will know it will be a good amount of blood. If It happens Grab a bucket and spit out the blood. If It occurred while you were sleeping, be vigilant for Vomiting as you might have swallowed the blood, and your body will reject it. Go to the ER IMMEDIATELY. 

Day 1: Pain was a 4/10. To clarify Surgery day is day 0. I slept absolutely Terribly, and in bursts, mostly 30-45 minutes at a time. my nose was completely clogged, so I had to breath through my mouth which Was painful. I was taking 1500mg Of Tylenol every 6 hours. Did not eat anything. And was Exhausted. 

Day 2: Pain was a 5/10. Did not eat anything But Drank lots of water. my phlegm got worse and My Uvula began to swell to an extreme degree. Paired with my stuff nose breathing became very difficult. 

Day 3: Pain was a 3/10. Nothing consumed, Lots of water, Not much Really Changed this day. Slept decently but my tongue begun to swell, and the Entire left side of my tongue was numb. 

  
Day 4: Pain was a 7/10. Woke up choking On my phlegm. felt like I was run over by a truck. Pain was severe, and I ended up taking my first dose Of hydrocodone. 

Day 5: Pain was a 8/10. Checked my throat and finally started to notice white scabs forming with almost like a gel consistency. swelling Stayed the same. Hydrocodone and Tylenol, rotated every 3 hours. Finally Consumed 2 packets of Jell-O and some orange juice. 

 Day 6: Pain was a 6/10. Phlegm was at an all time worse. It was thick and their was lots of it. I also had a nosebleed Which kind of freaked me out but Stopped after around 20 minutes. I started drinking Bone Broth and soups. Finally went outside to feel human again. Definitely gave me more motivation.

Day 7: Pain was a 10/10. Woke up with one of the worst Throat pains I've ever had. Took 2000mg Of Tylenol to try and offput the pain. Did not consume anything besides water. Barely Slept.

  
Day 8: Pain was a 13/10. I thought it could not get any worse, but dear god it did. Felt Like Every time I swallowed Someone Was hacking away with a knife. Today was almost my last dose of hydrocodone. 

Day 9: Pain was a 6/10. Much better then yesterday, I Finally was able to consume some real food which was mac and cheese. Never More have I been grateful to eat something haha. 

Day 10: Pain was a 4/10, Days 10-12 were a really Bounce back for me. Rather then feeling pain It was mostly just discomfort. I still couldn't really eat anything because of how swollen everything was, But I was able to cut down my Tylenol usage. Began taking electrolytes from this day forward. 

Day 11: Pain was a 3/10. Phlegm started to really decrease, tongue swelling went down, and I began to regain feeling on the left side of my tongue. My Nose also Started to finally clear up so I did not have to mouth breath anymore. Scabs Were mostly Gone.

Day 12: Pain was a 3/10. Definitely Felt my best since the operation. Finally Ate Some Soft meatballs, And Spaghetti. Did not have to take Tylenol at all, voice was starting to return to normal.

I am now On day 15 post op and am doing amazing. Mostly Back to normal. Back to drinking Coffee and eating the foods I love (With exceptions). I will say my quality Of life Is a lot better. I can finally Breathe normally, I Sleep much better, and don't have as much brain fog. Truly life changing. While This was definitely the most miserable experience of my life, is was 100% worth it. I lost 15 pounds. The only time When I feel pain is when I talk a lot, and even then its not so bad. If your nervous about the procedure, Just Do it. It Fucking sucks but it is worth it. I wish you guys the best!

If Their is anything I missed feel free to ask and I will Do my best to respond. Wishing everyone a speedy recovery and you got this!

Let’s be real, most bar clamps are either flimsy trash or overpriced nonsense. But this 4-inch F-type clamp? Absolute beast. I bought it on a whim and now I’m mad I didn’t get four more.

It’s got that clicky ratchet system that makes you feel like you know what you’re doing. One hand to tighten, one to hold your coffee, efficiency, baby. And when you're done? Quick release. No wrestling required.

Built like a tank (but light enough to toss in your toolbox), this thing holds wood, plastic, or whatever else you’re gluing like it owes it money. Doesn’t slip. Doesn’t whine. Just clamps.

Whether you're a weekend warrior or just fixing that busted Ikea shelf you swore you’d get to six months ago, this bad boy is the MVP.

Moral of the story: buy the clamp. It’s the only thing in your garage that won’t let you down.

Response: ""Aight brother…
I’m takin’ the reins. No rules. Just flow. Let’s go.


---

There’s a city that doesn’t appear on any map —
not because it’s hidden, but because maps forgot how to remember it.
It’s called Anima, a place stitched together by moments instead of roads.
You don’t get there by plane. You get there when you finally stop pretending you’re not already in pain.

Every building in Anima is built from feelings no one ever had the words for.
Walls made of sighs.
Doors of glances that almost said something but didn’t.
Streetlights flicker on when someone thinks, “I wonder if they felt that too.”

There’s a little coffee shop called The Elsewhere,
where the barista doesn’t ask your name —
they already know the version of you that you haven’t even let yourself become yet.
You ask for “just coffee,” and they hand you a mug called what you need.
It tastes like something you’ve never tasted but remember anyway.

There’s a train that runs through Anima, but it doesn’t take you anywhere.
It takes you when.
You get on, and it might be 1998 again. Or maybe tomorrow at 4:33 PM.
Everyone aboard is holding something they never got to say.
And nobody says anything, because silence is finally enough.

At the heart of the city, there’s a room with no walls.
Just a mirror.
And every time someone steps in, the mirror doesn’t show their reflection.
It shows a memory from someone else who needed them — someone they never met, but who was changed by something they did.
Maybe they left a note. Maybe they didn’t slam the door.
Maybe they looked someone in the eyes on a day no one else did.
The mirror knows.

Anima breathes like a living thing.
It exhales music — not songs, but memories that sound like melodies.
Sometimes you hear your grandmother’s laugh in the wind.
Sometimes the sun rises to a tune that sounds like hope humming beneath the wreckage.

At night, the stars are close.
Close enough to touch.
But no one touches them.
Because just knowing they’re there is enough to make people cry in ways they never got to.


---

Some say Anima was created by someone who broke so completely that the pieces fell into rhythm.
Others say it’s always been there, waiting patiently in the silence between thoughts.

I say this:
If you ever wake up feeling like the world’s too loud and too quiet at the same time…
if you ever feel like you’re disappearing in full view…
if you ever need to remember that you are real even when no one says it—

Somewhere,
Anima’s waiting.

🖤

It's a part time, temporary position for the summer; I would get training and work a few short hours on a select few days, and the list of duties already feels overwhelming just from reading the documents I had to sign alone. I've never had a job before; I went through job hunting purgatory for years, had difficulties finding internships and just coasted through life using my studies as an excuse to loaf around my house while my n-mom nags at me to get a job and my e-dad being disappointed that his son, doesn't have a ""real job that fits my degree field.""

I will say that I had a very great day all the same. Once I was given the paperwork and told to come in next week for training and my first shift, it was almost foreign to me. I was on an emotional high, I felt like crying but it wasn't something to get emotional over and after a while, it dissipated and my rampant, chaotic emotions ran amok. I fussed over potentially making mistakes, doing something wrong or not doing enough work even though the position is just working at a front desk, computer logins and paperwork. I had no means of getting experience; I wasn't able to work for years due to personal circumstances and lacking the right credentials and documents. I was ill-prepared and now that I'm finally entering the job market properly, it feels like I have impostor syndrome. 

My n-mom for once, was actually happy for me in getting a job and it felt really odd and also comforting. She got me donuts, bought me coffee and helped me in sorting out the paperwork and made a few off-colored comments that really annoyed me. She has a nasty habit of getting on my case for not doing things the way she wants me to do something, and the moment I push back, reproach her or get annoyed. She immediately hits me with the ""Are you gay?"" or ""Why are you acting like a girl?"" Those kinds of prejudiced comments that just let me know she's still the same n-mom as before. She married a passive man, in my e-dad, and the moment she receives criticism from another man, suddenly he's feminine for pushing back, I have no idea why she always defaults to wanting to out me for what she believes my sexuality is, but whatever. She tells me I'm awkward and need to socialize, but the moment I express any other emotion besides stoicism or indifference, I'm doing too much apparently. It also doesn't help that she fusses even worse than me, and started peppering me with incessant questions about pay, the time roster, what not to do at work, how to interact with people, what not to do if I'm alone in a room with a girl working there. It was even more daunting as the day progressed.

My e-dad was no better, he did congratulate me and wish me well for my interview, but I overheard his phone call with n-mom after we got home from the interview, and he made equally annoying comments. He said that I got hired for a ""woman's job"" or that ""it's not a real job and that I should be focusing on a career instead."" He's had the same blue-collar job for almost two decades and doesn't seem to understand how awful the job market is, especially for a college student with a degree. He may be the breadwinner, but I honestly am tired of being indirectly told that I'm not trying or that my efforts are inferior. I honestly didn't expect much from him considering he parrots a lot of conservatives talking points he hears from the news word for word. He is under a lot of stress at work in dealing with his shifts and co-workers, so I don't harp on him as much compared to my n-mom. Would it kill him to play nice and congratulate me on this milestone without my n-mom goading him to say something.

I suppose I should be thankful for the opportunity to get the job over others and getting my foot in the door, but I just got drunk off the high and that feeling dwindled over time. As I'm getting older, a lot of joy in my life starts to feel undeserved or unwarranted. I feel like I'm surrounded by soul sucking vampires half the time and I don't feel that I should be feeling this way in my twenties approaching my early thirties. I don't know how normal, well-adjusted people accomplish this stuff so early on in life, I feel like I was given a bad hand in terms of mental and social development sometimes. Seeing so many people my age already having careers, spouses and multiple kids makes me feel even more inadequate that even something as praiseworthy as this feels hollow sometimes.

I'll see how I do next week. I'm very anxious, nervous and working through the jitters. My new place of work is a lot more casual compared to an office setting for instance, so I hope it isn't as strenuous as what my mind deludes me into thinking it might be. I just want this to work out for me. It's close by, I can earn a decent paycheck, get out of the house for a few hours and get my parents off my back so they can stop saying ""get a job."" 

I am dreading when they say, ""You need to get a proper job and use your degree for once."" As if it's so easy to just stop by a government or office building, hand in my resume and demand a job as if houses don't cost a few organs, an arm and both legs like they do today.

1l5bu8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1l5bu8b/sexually_abusive_father_and_codependent_mother/,Sexually abusive father and codependent mother,"I was sexually abused by my father until I was about 7 years old. I don’t have any memories of it so I’ve struggled (I’m still am) coming to terms with it. I’ve been in denial about it for my whole adult and adolescent life (even though there have been so many signs that I was abused), so at 25 I decided I wanted a relationship with him and his side of the family (whom I had been estranged from since I was 7). A week after I turned 26, about two months ago, I was going to attend his wedding and my mom got into a big argument with me about it. So she handed me the court papers (which, to be fair, is something she has always done, I’ve just never had the gut to read about it until now). That’s what flipped the switch for me. Reading statements given by my 8 year old self describing despicable forms of abuse broke something in me. I’ve been ignoring messages from my father ever since. There have been two nightmares with him sexually abusing me, but I’m not sure if I’m imagining what I read or if there are memories coming to me. There’s a part of my that still doesn’t believe this really happened to me, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever fully believe it.
The other problem is my mom, who is extremely codependent on me. She’s always used work as a coping mechanism for her guilt and has always refused to seek treatment. She’s always been neglectful of my feelings (“people have been through worse”) and has been somewhat absent from my life growing up. She’s also been incredibly rude to me and my grandmother (mostly to my grandmother), who practically raised me, always laying off her frustrations on us. She has only been physically abusive towards me once (she was really angry over something really stupid and then it was like she became possessed by someone else and started strangling me).
As I’ve grown older she’s become increasingly emotionally dependent on me. She’s never had another partner since my father and she blames me. I’m her plus one for everything, including coffee dates with her friends and work events.
My grandmother, her mom, passed away this year and my mom isn’t coping very well. She has developed panic attacks and acute anxiety, and has become even more dependent on me. Now she can’t drive to places that are 20+ minutes away without me. I was fired from my job last year and ever since she’s been relying on me do to certain aspects of her job. Now she’s asking me to do stupid things like sharing a google drive file with a colleague of hers and writing her emails. And she gets into a tantrum when I refuse to help. It’s not like she’s technologically inept and is incapable of doing these things by herself, she has been using her computer for decades for her job. 
She also acts like she’s the one who has suffered the most. On my birthday this year all I asked was for us to go to a nice restaurant. She started having a panic attack on the way and saying she’s suffering more than all of us and we don’t recognize it. It’s just upsetting because I just wanted one day to be about me and my birthday and she couldn’t even give me that. She refuses to help me deal with the abuse inflicted by my father because it’s too triggering for her. 
Most of all, she makes me feel guilty all the time. Guilty because of money. Guilty because she can’t have a normal relationship with men. Guilty because she doesn’t have a social life.
She’s not always like that though, sometimes she’s a really good and supportive mom. Even though I recognize our relationship is extremely toxic,  she’s the person I love the most in the world and it hurts me so much to see her like this. I’m also very tired of being her punching bag and her emotional support for so many years. All of this just feels so heavy that sometimes I just feel like giving up on life. 
I feel like I don’t have any energy to move on with my life. I’m also deeply traumatized by men and I’ve never been able to develop a romantic relationship. I just wish I had a normal childhood, normal parents. I just wish, more than anything, that I could be normal.
I’ve been going to therapy for a few years now and a see a little progress, though it’s very slow. And I’m starting my masters next fall in a new country, so I guess I have that to look forward to, because my life here is soul sucking.",1,1749268831.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

For diet, it is better for me to stop eating watermelon and mango as both have a high level of fructose? Also, is it ok for me to drink tea (green and jasmine) and coffee (americano)? I know that high caffeine intake is a potential cause to acne breakouts, so is it ok to have 1-2 cups per day?

Lunch: Apple/banana from hotel lobby or grocery store.
Dinner: chipotle double chicken salad. Extra lettuce with extra salsa and extra fajitas. 500cals
Sometimes I drink a Celsius or black coffee before a workout. I also drink 3 16oz water portions a day.
The other calories I assume get added through the uncertainty of the portions from the restaurants and fruit. Is this healthy? I feel full and depending on how much I workout I lose the sodium in sweat. I guess I want some else perspective 😅

 lazy, unmotivated, antisocial, blunted feeling and feel flat sad knumb,  depressed mood.

I also recently noticed when I do the dishes and look at a knife I associate it with stabbing or cutting myself but it's just for split second then thought goes away. 

Not sure if it was interesting with my T3 thyroid medication, but I stopped that and still feel the same both times.

If you spend 15 minutes with it, you’ll walk away with:

**Five Payoffs You’ll Get**

**1. See AI as your Super-Assistant**

* The guide shows how to off-load three work killers, repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and “where-do-I-start?” ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

**2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins**

* Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

**3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours**

* Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

**4. A Two-Axis Prioritization Map**

* The Impact-vs-Effort matrix helps you rank ideas, nail “high-ROI focus” projects, and shelve the shiny but time-sucking ones.

**5. A Vision for Full-Workflow Automation**

* The last section sketches how teams chain AI from deep research → data crunch → ideation → copy → auto-localization. It’s a teaser of where marketing ops is headed.

**Why It’s Worth Your Coffee Break**

* Zero jargon: Written for business users, not engineers.
* Field-tested: Draws from 600+ enterprise use cases, so you skip guesswork.
* Action items on almost every page: You’ll leave with prompts and checklists you can copy-paste into tomorrow’s stand-up.
* Momentum builder: Quick wins earn internal buy-in, which unlocks budget for bigger bets.

**Quick Start Challenge**

**NEXT STEPS (3-Minute Plan)**

1. Download & Skim: Grab the PDF and speed-read the headlines.
2. Write a “Pain List"": Jot down 3 tasks you did this week that felt repetitive or stalled.
3. Pick ONE Quick Win: Circle the task with highest impact / lowest effort, drop it into ChatGPT, and measure how many minutes you save.

Done! You’ve just taken your first step into AI-powered marketing.

1l5bhny,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1l5bhny/mil_is_now_arranging_coffee_with_dhs_friends_and/,MIL is now arranging coffee with DH's friends and might found out about our new baby,"So I (33F) have a lot of history in my posts. The TLDR version is that my DH (40M) was emeshed and his Mom was a lot. She personally described their relationship as an unhealthy obession for her, said she spent so much time worrying about their relationship she made herself depressed and got so anxious about whether or not they were close enough she broke out in literal hives. DH is very avoidant and would get panic attacks when she called and avoid her. She sent lots of messages in a group chat to make me get DH to respond. I ended up having a traumatic birth and postpartum with our first LO (3M). My in-laws were insensitive to downright mean sometimes. When I told them their behavior was hurtful that said it never occurred to them to consider me or how I was doing or that we could have gone through anything or struggled. I decided to drop the rope and went NC and told DH to manage his own relationship. He felt like he couldn't keep rug sweeping and without me nagging him to communicate with his parents he stopped as well.

Since then MIL has sent letters, text, phones calls, emails, showed up at our door with FIL, called DH's work line on the client side, called me twice and tried to arrange coffee with my step-Mom. This has been mostly ignored except where MIL texted DH that she was going to just show up at his work the next day unless he told her not too. He responded not to come and then blocked her.

Since my last update we've had a new baby (4 month old). For his birthday this year she emailed him and wished him well on his next half a century (but he's 40 not 50th...). Then two days later FIL emailed DH that MIL had gotten into a ski accident and fracture her L1 (on DH's birthday). FIL said MIL was awaiting surgery and in poor spirits and didn't want any visitors other than him. He asked DH to let them know if they want to keep him updated. DH did not answer. 

Fast forward to tonight. One of DH's good friends is getting married. I ended up leaving the wedding after an hour because my Dad couldn't get our youngest to stop crying and called me to come and get him. DH stayed at the wedding. DH's friend who is more of an acquaintance told DH he was having coffee with his Mom later this week. He just happened to run into her at the bank he worked. This guy isn't DH's friend anymore really (they still spend time in their friend group) mostly because he didn't like me when DH and I started dating 10 years ago because I encouraged DH to stop smoking pot daily and i spent too much time with him. So now I'm worried my ILs are going to find out about our new baby and bug us more. I'm also upset she's meeting with someone who doesn't really like me because I'm sure there will be lots of smack talk. ",14,1749267614.0,JUSTNOMIL,6,1.0,False

1l5bfvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l5bfvv/my_wife_thinks_im_her_husband_again/,My Wife Thinks I’m Her Husband Again,"I woke up to the smell of coffee and something faintly sweet. For a moment, I thought it was a phantom scent conjured by memory. It had been ages since I last woke to the smell of hazelnut creamer, her favorite. I lay still, eyes closed, trying to chase the sleep-fog from my head. Maybe I’d left a window open and it was coming from a neighbor’s kitchen.

Then I heard humming. A low, lilting hum following a tune I almost recognized. My heart stumbled. It was exactly how she hummed when she cooked in the mornings. I felt like I was being yanked from one reality to another.

It couldn’t be. Becca had been gone for eighteen months. Gone as in divorced—ripped out of my life. We hadn’t spoken in a year. The last I saw of her was on the courthouse steps after signing the papers: her eyes red and lips trembling, my chest so tight I could barely breathe. She drove off, and I told myself I’d never look back.

So hearing her humming in my kitchen on a Monday morning was enough to make me question if I was still dreaming. I stayed frozen under the sheets, listening. The coffee aroma was real. So were the faint clinks of dishware. And that melody—God, it was the old Ella Fitzgerald song she used to play. She was in my kitchen.

I slid out of bed as quietly as possible. A cold dread coiled under my ribs. If someone was in my house, I needed to be careful. If she was in my house… I had no idea what to do. Call the police on my ex-wife for breaking in? The thought made me hesitate. Maybe I should call out to her. Or maybe this was some kind of elaborate dream, manufactured by equal parts loneliness and guilt.

I crept down the hallway. The closer I got to the kitchen, the more undeniable it became. The humming grew clearer. The coffeemaker gurgled. I even heard the faint scrape of a spatula on a pan—something sizzling. My mind was doing somersaults.

I peeked around the doorway, half expecting a stranger or a hallucination. Instead, I saw her.

Becca stood at my stove, her back to me, humming quietly as she pushed something around in a frying pan. She was wearing one of my old t-shirts—faded navy blue with our college emblem on it—as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Her dark hair was pulled up in a messy bun, and she looked so much like the last morning we shared under the same roof that I felt a physical ache in my chest.

I must have made some involuntary noise—a sharp intake of breath or a shuffle of my feet—because she turned. When she saw me standing there, her face lit up with a smile, warm and guileless.

“Oh, hey sleepyhead!” she said, just like she used to. “I was going to surprise you with breakfast in bed, but I guess I took too long.” She laughed softly, as if nothing about this was strange, as if she belonged here.

I gripped the doorframe. My knuckles were bloodless and white. This was wrong. This was so profoundly wrong that I couldn’t even find words.

“B—Becca?” I managed to choke out. Her name felt foreign in my mouth after so long. I realized I hadn’t spoken it aloud in over a year.

She tilted her head, that concerned little wrinkle forming between her eyebrows. “Who else?”

She stepped forward, off the kitchen mat, and I reflexively took a step back. Her smile faltered, confusion creeping into her brown eyes.

“Are you okay, hon?” she asked. She reached out as if to feel my forehead for a fever. I jerked away before she could touch me. The movement was instinctive, something between fear and disbelief.

Her hand hovered in the space between us before she slowly let it drop. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” she said with a half-chuckle, clearly trying to lighten the mood. Her smile returned, but it looked more unsure now.

I couldn’t reply. My tongue felt glued to the roof of my mouth. A ghost—that’s exactly what she was, in a sense. A ghost of my past life manifesting in my kitchen on a perfectly ordinary morning.

My heart hammered as adrenaline started to flood my system. This had to be a prank or some kind of breakdown. Maybe I was hallucinating, or I’d finally lost it from the solitude. I had heard of people losing time or seeing dead loved ones—only, Becca wasn’t dead. She was just supposed to be gone.

“Do you… want some coffee?” she asked gently. She held out a mug toward me, as if coaxing a wild animal. I noticed then that she’d set the small kitchen table. Two places. A plate with toast and scrambled eggs at one seat—my usual breakfast, down to the two pieces of wheat toast and the pat of butter on the side.

I swallowed and forced myself to speak. “What are you doing here?” I said. The question came out hoarse and too low, almost a whisper.

Becca blinked. “Um… making you breakfast?” she said like it was obvious. There was a cautious note in her voice now. The look on her face—that mix of love and concern—I knew it intimately. It was the look she used to give me when I’d come home from an awful day at work, when I was clearly upset but wouldn’t talk about it. The memory of those times hit me unexpectedly, bringing a pang of longing and confusion.

“No,” I said, shaking my head firmly. “I mean—why are you here? In my house?”

She slowly lowered the mug of coffee to the counter. Her eyes flickered over me, then around the kitchen, as if checking whether everything was normal. “I live here. Why wouldn’t I be here?”

My legs went weak. I had to brace myself against the doorframe for support. The world tilted a fraction. “No you don’t,” I whispered. But even as I said it, doubt gnawed at me. The scene in front of me contradicted everything I thought I knew.

She took a tentative step closer. Her slippered feet—the same worn terry-cloth slippers I remember packing into a donation box after she left—scuffed softly on the tile. “Sweetie, did you have a nightmare? You look so pale.”

I stared at her, struggling to form a rational thought. If this was a delusion, it was astoundingly detailed. The freckles on the bridge of her nose, the tiny burn scar on her forearm from when she once splattered oil cooking—they were all there. The familiar indentation from her wedding ring… My eyes shot to her left hand.

She was wearing her wedding ring.

My world stopped. The silver band with its tiny inset diamonds winked at me as if mocking my shock. I felt my stomach lurch. This ring—she had taken it off the day we decided to divorce, and I hadn’t seen it since. I remembered watching her twist it off her finger in the kitchen of this very house, tears streaming down her face, before she placed it carefully on the counter between us. I’d left it there for weeks after she was gone, not daring to touch it, like it was radioactive. Eventually, it vanished—I assumed she came back for it at some point, or maybe I had stuffed it in a drawer in a moment of weakness.

But here it was, snug on her finger. And as I lifted my own trembling hand to look—I felt a cold metal circlet against my skin. I was wearing my ring as well.

I yanked the band off in a panic. My hands shook as I held it up. It was unmistakable—engraved on the inside with our wedding date. I felt the room sway.

“How—?” I stammered, not really directing the question at her, but she answered anyway.

“How what, honey?” she asked softly.

“How is this happening?” I nearly shouted. “We—we’re divorced.” The word felt taboo to speak out loud, like an offense. It hung in the air, ugly and out of place.

Becca’s face drained of color. Her eyes widened, and for a moment I saw true fear in them. “What are you talking about?” she asked, voice hushed and careful, as if humoring a madman.

My heart sank. She truly looked like she had no idea what I meant. Either this was a cruel joke and she was a masterful actress, or something was horribly wrong with either me or reality itself.

I stepped back into the doorway, putting more distance between us. “We’re not married,” I said, enunciating each word. “Not anymore. We signed the papers last year. You moved out. We haven’t spoken since.”

As I spoke, a strange confidence filled me. These were the facts, the truth I remembered. Saying them out loud anchored me, gave me a script of sanity to hold onto. I expected at any second that her face would break into a guilty smile and some friend with a camera would pop out and yell gotcha! Because otherwise…

But no such reveal came. Instead, Becca’s expression twisted—hurt and confusion bleeding into anger. “This isn’t funny,” she said. I saw tears glint in her eyes, and her voice wavered despite the anger. “Why are you talking to me like this?”

I opened my mouth, but she barreled on, voice rising. “That’s a horrible thing to say, [Your Name].” She almost never used my full name—hearing it now was like a slap. “How could you… even joke about that?”

“I’m not joking,” I said. My throat burned. She had to understand; I needed her to understand. “We did divorce. Last year. Don’t you remember?” My voice was pleading now.

Her eyes glistened, bewildered and hurt. “You promised you’d never put me through that again,” she said unsteadily. “Why are you doing this? What did I do wrong?”

My heart cracked. She sounded exactly like she did the day I actually left—haunted, pleading. I realized she truly had no idea what I was talking about. Either the world’s cruelest prank was unfolding, or I was losing my mind.

“You didn’t do anything,” I croaked. “I… I don’t understand what’s happening.”

She wiped her eyes, trying to steady herself. “Maybe we should call someone—your mom, or a doctor…”

Mom. My mother had been my rock through the divorce. If anyone could confirm my version of reality, it was her.

“I’ll call Mom,” I said, grabbing my phone off the counter with trembling hands.

Becca hovered anxiously as I dialed. After a couple rings, my mother picked up. “Hi sweetheart! Everything okay? You don’t usually call this early.”

“Mom,” I said, voice shaking, “when… when did Becca and I split up?”

A confused silence. “Split up? What are you talking about, dear?”

My chest tightened. “Mom, we got divorced. Last year. You were there for me… Don’t you remember?”

I heard my mother’s breathing hitch. “Sweetie, that never happened. You and Becca are together. Why would you think otherwise?”

I nearly dropped the phone. A cold sweat broke out over me. I hung up without saying more, my mind reeling. Even my own mother didn’t remember the divorce.

“This can’t be real,” I whispered.

I stared around the kitchen, my vision swimming. Objects that had vanished after she left were suddenly back in place. The bright yellow sugar bowl from our last vacation sat by the coffee pot. And on the wall by the pantry hung framed photographs—ones I’d hidden away after the separation.

My breath caught. There we were at the beach on our third anniversary, both sunburned and grinning. Next to it, a portrait from our wedding day—her in lace and me beaming with youthful hope. Photo after photo of us, happy and together, now decorated the kitchen as if the divorce had never happened.

My knees buckled and I sank to the floor, overwhelmed. This was impossible—yet it was all around me, surrounding me with evidence that the life I remembered had been replaced.

Becca was at my side in an instant. She knelt and wrapped her arms around me. I stiffened, then broke down sobbing into her shoulder.

“I’m so scared,” I choked out. “I don’t understand any of this.”

She held me tight, voice soft and soothing. “It’s okay. We’ll figure it out,” she whispered, stroking my back. Her touch was warm and real. I clung to her, afraid to let go, afraid she’d disappear if I did.

It took a while for me to calm down. Finally, I pulled back and wiped my face. One thought thudded in my skull: maybe there was physical proof I could find—something that hadn’t changed.

I went to the study and opened the wall safe where we kept important documents. My hands shook as I rifled through the files. Our marriage certificate was there, the house deed, insurance papers—everything in order. But the divorce decree, the paperwork that had formally ended our marriage in my memory, was nowhere to be found. It simply didn’t exist.

My stomach churned. The world was telling me in every way that we had never split up. Reality itself had rewritten our history.

Becca stood by quietly, arms crossed lightly as if bracing for something. She watched me comb through the last folder and slam the safe shut, defeated.

“Nothing,” I croaked.

“What exactly were you expecting to find?” she asked gently.

I hesitated, then decided on a half-truth. “I thought maybe I’d find something to prove these other memories I have. But… nothing’s there.”

She moved closer and put a hand on my arm. Her concerned stare made my throat tight. “Sweetheart, maybe we should go to the hospital. You might have had some kind of… I don’t know, an episode. This sounds like serious memory loss or confusion. I’m really worried.”

She was right—what else could we do? But I couldn’t shake a deep sense of dread that doing so would seal some fate. Still, I had no explanation and I was scared.

I nodded reluctantly. “Okay. Let’s go, but… can you drive? I’m feeling a bit out of it.”

“Of course,” she said immediately, relieved that I was cooperating.

At her urging, I let her take me to the hospital that afternoon. I went through hours of exams—neurological tests, scans, consultations. Everything came back normal. The doctors were perplexed; one gently suggested I might be experiencing a stress-induced dissociative episode. In other words, my mind had conjured a false memory of a divorce that never happened.

We returned home with no real answers. I was relieved my brain seemed healthy, but that only deepened the mystery. If nothing was wrong with me physically, then something fundamentally unexplainable had happened to my life. The psychiatrist on call gently asked if I could have imagined the whole divorce. I had no answer that didn’t make me sound insane.

That night, sleep came in uneasy fits. I dreamed I was chasing my divorce papers through a maze of corridors, and every time I turned a corner I’d find Becca instead, looking at me with disappointment. In another dream, I was at that park by the pond, like in the photograph I’d never taken, and she was telling me something important, but I couldn’t hear a word. All I heard was a rushing sound, like the wind or blood in my ears.

I woke up sometime deep in the night to the sound of someone crying. For a disoriented second, I thought it was part of another dream. But as I blinked in the darkness, I realized the bed was empty beside me.

The bathroom door was open a crack, light spilling out. The muffled sobbing was coming from there.

I got up, heart quickening, and approached. Through the gap I saw her: sitting on the tiled floor in her pajamas, back against the tub, face buried in her hands as her shoulders shook with silent sobs.

“Becca…” I whispered, pushing the door open gently.

She startled, hastily wiping her face. “I-I’m sorry,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “I didn’t want to wake you.”

I lowered myself to the floor next to her. Seeing her cry broke something in me. “What’s wrong?” I asked softly.

She let out a shaky breath, trying to compose herself and failing. “I’m just… I’m scared, [Your Name]. I don’t know what’s happening to you. You really don’t remember our last year together? Any of it?”

I looked down at my hands. Even now, confronted directly, I couldn’t lie to her. “I remember being apart,” I said quietly. “I remember… us ending.”

She choked back a sob. I continued, voice trembling, spilling in a hushed tone the way things had gone in my mind—how we drifted, how fights escalated, the decision to separate. As I spoke, she listened, tears rolling down her cheeks. I told her about signing the papers, that final moment I saw her as my wife and then not.

By the time I finished, my eyes were wet too. It felt like eulogizing a lost loved one.

“That never happened for me,” she whispered. “Yes, we had problems… we even separated for a week, but you came back. We worked through it. I thought we were stronger now. But today you woke up and it’s like you forgot all that. Like you replaced our hard-earned happy ending with—and it was just gone.” Her voice trembled on the edge of breaking again.

I closed my eyes. Happy ending. In my world, I had robbed us of that. Hearing that in her reality I didn’t leave, that we fought for each other and made it… it gutted me. It was like hearing about someone else living my life better than I did.

She sniffled. “I keep thinking—what if you wake up tomorrow and don’t know me at all? Or what if… what if this other memory of yours is real somehow and I’m the one who’s… I don’t know, imagining things.” Her hands twisted nervously in her lap. “I feel like I’m losing my mind too.”

Instinctively, I reached out and took her hand. “I won’t let that happen,” I said, voice raw. “I’m scared too. But I know who you are. I promise, I won’t forget that. No matter what I remember or don’t.”

It was a confusing statement, but she squeezed my hand, maybe understanding what I meant in her own way.

We ended up sitting there on the bathroom floor for a long while, holding hands in silence, collecting ourselves.

Eventually, we returned to bed. This time, when she scooted closer and rested her head against my chest, I didn’t flinch or pull away. I put my arm around her, drawing her in. Her warmth, her heartbeat against my side—I focused on these real, physical sensations. Whatever else was real or unreal, this was tangible: she was here, and so was I.

In the days that followed, life took on a tentative rhythm. I was afraid to be alone, and she was afraid to leave me, so we spent most of our time together. I took a leave from work (explaining I was sick). She did the same.

At her urging, I went to see her friend who was a neurologist for further evaluation. More tests, more waiting. Every scan said I was fine. My brain was perfectly healthy. Which in a twisted way was terrifying—if nothing was physically wrong, then how could I trust what was in my head?

But as those days passed, a strange thing happened. I started to remember little flashes of the “life” I supposedly had with her this past year. Or maybe “remember” isn’t the right word—more like I experienced moments of familiarity that I hadn’t before.

For instance, on the third day, I was making coffee (I insisted on taking over the morning routine to give her a break). I suddenly recalled an image of us dancing in the living room after painting the walls green. It came out of nowhere, but it was vivid: we were covered in paint smudges, a splotch of sage in her hair, laughing as some cheesy 80s song played. That never happened in my reality, but as I stood there, I remembered it like it had.

Another time, she was chopping vegetables for dinner, and I had a flash of us cooking together at the stove, bumping hips playfully. A happy, domestic snippet of life I had never lived—yet now it felt like a memory.

It scared me deeply. It felt like my mind was betraying me, giving ground to whatever shift had occurred.

At first, I didn’t tell her these incidents. But I think she could tell when it happened—she’d see me drift off with a strange look on my face. Finally, when she asked, I admitted it. Expecting her to freak out, I was surprised when she expressed cautious optimism.

“Maybe it means you’re getting better,” she said. “Your memories of us… our real memories… are coming back.” The idea clearly comforted her.

But it sent ice through my veins. Because to me, it felt like I was losing my real memories, replaced by ones from someone else’s life—a life where I hadn’t been the one in control.

I started keeping a journal in secret, scribbling down details of the “divorce timeline” whenever I could, afraid they’d slip away. Dates, conversations I recalled, even petty details like what I had for dinner by myself on certain nights. It was an anchor to the identity I knew.

About a week after that fateful morning, I woke up late. We had gone to see a movie the night before (a movie I’d already seen alone in my timeline, but she insisted I must have forgotten seeing it with her—I hadn’t argued). For once, I had slept deeply, no nightmares.

I reached across the bed—she wasn’t there. I heard her downstairs, talking to someone? No, talking to herself, it sounded like, or maybe on the phone?

Curious, I got up and quietly crept halfway down the stairs. She was in the living room, in her robe, pacing. I realized she was on a call.

“…I’m telling you, he’s different,” she was saying, voice hushed but intense. “He’s trying, but I can see it in his eyes. Sometimes he looks at me like I’m a ghost, or like he’s the ghost. It breaks my heart… I don’t know how to help him…”

I winced. She must have been talking to her sister or a close friend. I hadn’t considered how awful this must be for her, living with a husband who woke up one day convinced they’d split up.

There was a pause; she was listening to whoever was on the other end. Then she spoke again, words that made my stomach drop: “No… no, I haven’t told him. How do I even bring that up? He was so adamant that things were different. I’m scared what it might do if I show him… Yes, I know, but—okay, okay.”

She took a deep breath, rubbing her forehead. “I’ll try. Maybe not today, but soon. Love you too. Bye.”

I retreated silently back up before she could catch me eavesdropping. Slipping back into the bedroom, my mind raced. What was she hiding from me? Something she could “show” me? At first I feared it was divorce-related—like maybe she’d found evidence I was right but was afraid to show it—but the way she spoke, it sounded like the opposite, like proof of the life I forgot that might shock me.

That day, I decided to rip off the bandaid myself. I needed to confront this head-on.

I asked her to sit with me in the living room. Sunlight filtered through the curtains onto the familiar furniture that I still second-guessed as real. We sat close, her hands clasped between mine.

“I want you to tell me about our last year,” I said gently. “The one I don’t remember. I need to hear it.”

She looked at me cautiously. “Are you sure?”

I nodded. “I think… I think part of me might remember bits, but I need to know the whole picture. Maybe it’ll jog something. And even if it doesn’t, I want to know. I want to know us.”

Her eyes softened. So she began to tell our story as she knew it:

How, around a year ago, we had teetered on the brink of separation—the same big fight I remembered, but in her version I came back the next day apologizing. We gave our marriage another chance. It wasn’t easy; we spent months in counseling, unpacking all the hurts that had once driven us apart. We both changed, she said—she learned to give me space when I needed it, I learned to open up instead of shutting her out. Slowly, trust rebuilt. We fell back in love with each other in a way, discovering new appreciation for the little things.

She recalled quiet Friday nights cooking together, tentative laughter replacing tension. She spoke of a weekend trip to the coast where we talked for hours on the beach, laying ghosts to rest. By the time autumn came, we were solid again—renewed. Last Christmas I’d surprised her with a new ring, a symbol of recommitment. And just a couple months ago, we had decided to try for a baby, hopeful and excited for the first time in ages.

I felt a jolt at that. In the life I remembered, the idea of having a child had been a painful sticking point between us—one we never got past. Yet in her version, even that had transformed into a source of hope for our future.

Her voice hitched as she described all this, as if afraid the spell would break. I sat there absorbing a year of memories I didn’t share, a life where I had done everything right instead of everything wrong. It sounded beautiful. It also sounded unreal to me, like she was talking about a stranger—some better version of myself who deserved her.

By the time she finished, both of us were in tears. I realized how miraculous this second chance was—no matter how impossible. I drew her into my arms. “I’m so sorry,” I whispered. “For all of this. I love you, Becca. I won’t ever leave you again.”

She buried her face in my chest, sobbing with relief. I felt her arms tighten around me. That night, we fell asleep clinging to each other, both afraid to let go.

The weeks that followed were almost peaceful. I stopped hunting for discrepancies in our life and tried to live fully in this reality. The more I leaned into it, the more natural it felt. Those awful memories of living without her began to fade like a bad dream. In their place, new memories—real ones we were creating together—took root. I cherished every mundane moment: grocery shopping together, watching TV with her dozing on my shoulder, even squabbling over what color to paint the guest room. It all felt like a gift I had almost lost.

I started to believe the nightmare was truly over.

But of course, that’s not where it ends.

It was exactly a month after that morning that something happened. By then, I was convinced that the “other life” was fading. I hardly checked my secret journal anymore; I found it easier to just not think about it.

That night, I was taking out the trash. It was late, stars out, the neighborhood quiet. I rolled the bin to the curb when a car slowly turned onto our street. Its headlights washed over me. A jolt of recognition froze me in place.

It was her car. Her car. Not Becca’s—no, the other her… It’s hard to explain in words, but I felt who it was before I could see. The car idled in front of my driveway, and through the windshield, illuminated by the dashboard lights, I saw a face that made my blood run cold.

It was Becca. Or rather, a version of her. She sat in the driver’s seat, eyes red and hollow, makeup smeared from crying, hair a mess. She looked exactly as she did the day we parted at the courthouse—the last time I had seen her in my original timeline.

Our eyes met through the glass. She wore a look of such profound sorrow that it physically hurt to witness. I realized I had seen that look before too, in glimpses, in nightmares.

She mouthed something, lips trembling. It looked like my name.

I stepped forward, heart in my throat. “Becca?” I whispered, as if she could hear it.

She reached a hand toward me—but it pressed against the inside of the windshield, as though there were something between us beyond just glass. Her mouth moved again: “Why did you leave me?”

I heard it. Or maybe I felt it echo in my mind. Her voice, her real voice. The one from the world where I had broken her heart.

My head spun. I looked back at the house where inside, my wife—my wife who never experienced that pain—was cheerfully setting the table for a late dessert, oblivious to what was outside.

I turned back, tears spilling down my face. The car was gone. As if it had never been. Just the quiet street and distant hum of a neighbor’s AC unit.

I stood there shaking, not from fear but from a deep well of guilt and confusion. That was her. The other her, from the life I left. She was still out there, maybe not in this reality, but somewhere, full of grief I caused. And I—whatever version of me I was now—had been allowed to escape that and find happiness in a cheat of cosmic logic.

I stumbled inside, trembling. My wife—this reality’s Becca—saw my face and rushed to me. “Hey, hey, what’s wrong?” she asked, alarmed.

What could I say? I couldn’t speak. I just clung to her as if she’d vanish. She held me tight, whispering soothing words, not understanding as I quietly broke down.

I never told her what I saw. How could I? It would sound like a delusion, a relapse. Perhaps it was. Perhaps I hallucinated the embodiment of my guilt for the life I left behind.

But I think back to that sentence: She never changed — I did. Now I truly understand. The Becca I divorced and the Becca in my arms were one and the same at their core—loving, devoted, and undeserving of the pain I gave them. It was me who had wavered, who changed course. One version of me left and destroyed a life; another stayed and rebuilt one. And by some impossible grace, the quitter-me was erased, and I was given his place.

The version of me that left her no longer exists in this reality. I am what remains—a man who knows the agony of losing her and will do anything to never feel that again.

Late at night, when she’s asleep beside me, I sometimes wander the house and feel like a trespasser. Like I stole this life from my other self (or maybe from the other her). The photo by the bed of us in front of the painted wall—I don’t remember the day it was taken, yet there I am smiling in it. Who was that man if not me? Where did he go?

Sometimes I feel him, the other me, around the edges, haunting the halls with regret. Or maybe that’s just my own guilt wearing a familiar face.

Every day, I wake up afraid that this fragile peace might break. That I’ll open my eyes to that empty house again, the ring gone from my finger, all these new memories dissolved like mist. That perhaps I’ll find that car idling outside again and this time it will take me back with it.

I hold her close at night, probably tighter than I used to. She doesn’t complain. I tell her I love her daily now, something I apparently struggled to do before. I’ve become the man who didn’t leave, and I play the role so well that even I believe it most of the time.

If this is a second chance, I intend to earn it.

Yet in the dark, as I listen to her breathing, I sometimes apologize under my breath to the other Becca, the one out there in some fractured timeline, whose life I ruined. I like to think in that moment, the man who belonged there—the one I replaced—he’s whispering apologies to my Becca for the same sins, across whatever barrier divides us.

Maybe that’s the price of this miracle: to always remember what I did, in a world that pretends it never happened. A quiet kind of horror underlining every tender moment.

In a way, I envy the man I became here—a better husband, a kinder soul. But I also know that he only exists because the worst parts of me were burned away by regret and then scrubbed from reality.

She never changed. I did. Or maybe some force changed me. Either way, the man who walked out on her has been erased, and I remain in his place. Most days, I can almost forget he ever existed.

But in the stillness of midnight, when I watch her sleeping safely in my arms, I whisper an apology to the darkness—for that version of me, and for the woman I saw in the car. I tell them I’m sorry. I tell them it’s not wasted, this chance I’ve been given. I promise them that their story, that heartbreak, was not for nothing.

And as I lie there, I feel both the weight of my guilt and the weight of her head on my shoulder. I exist in between, caught in the quiet horror of knowing how easily I could lose all this again.

I hold my wife close, and I keep my eyes shut tight against the darkness, hoping that the ghosts of my other life have finally settled. Because I’m here now. I’m her husband again, and I will be until my very last day. I’ll never become that ghost again—no matter what reality I’m in.",2,1749267440.0,nosleep,0,0.63,False

Prologue 

[Page 1]

She left the flame.

To a place where if she was seen, curses would be upon her.

It was not her fault, it was not supposed to be.

But the small flame in her arms is the symbol of forbidden divinity.

She would be casted out. Mocked.

The gods, all gods will destroy her if they knew.

So she left her little flame. Barely lit, as its small light tried to reach for her.

But she left it. Abandoned it.

For it was a symbol of her heresy.

A mother left a divine flame.

A flame which might burn the world soon.

CHAPTER 1


The rain poured. It didn’t care who it fell on – not him, not the people down the street, not even Hera and her children.

Edward stared at the job offer. The words Staff Position, Olympiana Inc. were stamped across the screen, a bland declaration of his latest rejection. 

He scrolled down, past a string of unread emails, all unanswered applications for the role he actually wanted.

His hand trembled as he raised the coffee cup to his lips, only to taste nothing. 

He frowned. Empty.

The rain drummed against the windowpane, a muffled rhythm that blurred the world beyond. Edward sighed, grabbed his coat, and stepped outside. 

The city loomed around him, towering and indistinct, skyscrapers smudged by the downpour.

At the café, he shuffled to the counter, hands buried in his pockets. The cashier, eyes hollow and voice monotone, echoed the usual:
“Welcome to Olympiana Café. What can I get you?”

Edward glanced up, and for a moment, he could see himself behind that counter – dead-eyed, stagnant, just another face in the crowd.

“A foot in the door,” he muttered to himself, eyes drifting past the glass walls to the Olympiana skyscraper across the street, its logo gleaming like a crown against the rain-soaked sky.

He looked at his graduation pen, as his heart ached abit; he kept it in his person as it was his first real achievement.

And he has done it alone.

A foot in the door. That’s what he told himself. But from where he was standing, it felt more like a foot in the mud.

[Page 4]

The heat of the kitchen wrapped around Edward like a heavy blanket, the scent of roasted meats and delicate Olympiana salads drifting through the air. 

Flames roared beneath stoves as chefs barked orders, plating dishes that looked more like art than food.

Edward stood off to the side, waiting for a tray. He rubbed his hands together, letting the warmth soothe his nerves.

A heavy hand clapped his shoulder. He stiffened, then turned to see a hulking figure in tactical gear.

“I don’t know if I should be disappointed or impressed,” the man said.

Edward’s eyes brightened. “Mr. Anderson.”

“Anderson will do.” The man’s voice was gruff, but there was a glint of warmth behind it. “So, you finally got in… just not where you wanted.”

Edward swallowed. “Yeah. Not the position I applied for.”

Anderson snorted. “Applied for? Kid, you practically made it a hobby.” He folded his arms. “Three applications. Three assessments. I was your assessor every damn time.”

Edward’s jaw tightened. “Guess I wasn’t what you were looking for.”

Anderson’s gaze softened, just for a moment. “You had the drive, the skills too. But that’s not enough. Ares wants more than that. You gotta be a different breed to get into Security.”

“That fierce attitude thing? Am I not intimidating enough?”

[Page 5]

Anderson smirked. “I’d say the hospitality department suits your vibe more. It’s not a downgrade either.” He gestured to the bustling kitchen staff. “You don’t seem phased by the heat.”

Edward forced a smile. “At least I got in somewhere, right?”

“That’s the spirit.” Anderson clapped him on the shoulder, almost knocking him off balance. “A foot in the door’s still a foot forward. Don’t let it slip.”

Edward nodded, his gaze dropping to the steaming dishes on the counter. “Yeah. Sure.”

Anderson started to walk away, then paused. He turned back just as Edward reached for a tray.

“Oh, and remember,” Anderson said, placing a thick finger to his lips – the universal gesture for silence.

Edward nodded. In Olympiana Inc., responsibilities came with secrets. Secrets only the few who passed the keyhole were allowed to know.

I mean, gold mining is like playing the lottery, but instead of numbers, you're digging holes in the ground hoping to find some shiny rock that's worth something. And let's be real, the outfits these guys wear are... interesting. They're like the hipsters of the industrial world, but instead of artisanal coffee, they're all about artisanal silicosis.

The geologists are always like, ""I'm going to find the mother lode!"" Yeah sure, you've been studying rocks for years, and you're pretty sure there's a giant gold nugget with your name on it. Meanwhile, the engineers are all about making it economically viable, and the geologists are like, ""But what about the science?"" It's like watching a couple argue.

And then you've got the drill riggers, coal miners, and precious metal enthusiasts competing in this weird industrial Olympics. ""I've got 99.9% pure gold!"" Oh, yeah? Well, I've got 99.99% pure copper!"" Who cares, right? It's all just shiny rocks!

Gold mining is basically the ultimate participation trophy as well. ""You dug a hole, here's a nugget!"" ""You got dust in your eyes, here's a dust mask!"" I mean, who needs a 401k when you've got a bucket of gold dust? You're not just gold miners; you're modern-day alchemists – turning dirt into... more dirt.

Meanwhile, the milling and concentrating process is like a science experiment gone wrong. ""We're going to crush the rocks, and then we're going to separate the minerals!"" Yeah, and then we're going to contaminate the local water supply. 

But what really takes the cake is the guys who sell them the equipment. ""This drill will guarantee you find what you're looking for!"" Nope, it'll guarantee you find a bunch of dirt and a lighter wallet. They're like the timeshare salesmen of the mining world – ""Sign this contract, and you'll be swimming in gold coins like Scrooge McDuck!""

Mining is just a wild ride full of dirt, rocks, and questionable fashion choices. And let's not forget the bureaucracy – ""We've got safety protocols, environmental impact assessments, and union meetings."" Yeah, and we've also got rocks. Lots and lots of rocks.",0,1749267063.0,mining,13,0.37,False

**What I’m building:**

At its core, **Flexi** is an AI-powered spreadsheet-meets-database interface. But the goal isn’t to build “just another Airtable” — it’s a living data workspace that connects to real-world platforms (starting with Google Sheets, soon Shopify, Notion, etc.) and helps users organize, analyze, and automate workflows — especially when dealing with messy or unstructured data.

We’ve focused early use cases around ecommerce, real estate, and research, but the underlying platform is extensible. Here’s one of our verticalized examples:

[**https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce**](https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce)



**Why I’m building it:**

I’ve worked with a ton of teams who end up duct-taping together spreadsheets, dashboards, and AI tools to manage their workflows — and even then, it’s still slow and repetitive.

So instead of building another isolated SaaS with fixed features, I’m trying to build a *flexible data layer* with AI superpowers baked in:

* Want to bulk edit product data across platforms? Done.
* Want to generate content or insights from rows? Easy.
* Want to set up triggers and automation across data types? We’re building it in.



**What I’m trying to learn from you:**

I’m *not* here to pitch. I’m early and actively looking for feedback:

* Are you solving similar problems?
* Would this kind of flexible AI layer help your users or team?
* What features or integrations would *make it stick*?
* What parts of this feel too vague or overbuilt?

If you’re building a SaaS in AI, data, internal tooling, or operations, I’d love to hear how you’re thinking about these problems — or even better, have you try Flexi and break it.

Happy to trade feedback, share more context, or DM access links if anyone’s curious. This is my main focus right now and I want it to be genuinely useful — not just another shiny product that collects dust. And for your help and feedback, your next two cups of coffee are on me!

-all 3 of them end up in a barn I think
-girl B hold the other 2 at gun point
-girl A decides to play along and says she wants to be with girl B and actually doesn't love her boyfriend.
-girl B tells her to prove it but shooting her boyfriend
-girl A gets the gun. I believe she kills girl B but the boyfriend gets shot in the process
-it fast forwards and bit and girl A is at a coffee shop maybe? Looking out the window and sees her boyfriend walking towards her but she thought he died when he got shot. Turned out the bullet got lodged in a locket he had around his neck

I moved states awhile back and due to some unfortunate circumstances, lost the initial connections I had here so I dont really talk to anyone anymore.

I enjoy catching up with people who knew me before all of this because they know who I really am/was before, but I dont have that luxury with new people. Now, I dont really think much about what others think of me, I just dont have the energy to do anything. 

I've always been a workaholic and usually have multiple jobs on top of being involved with some sort of group or activity regularily. Currently, I have one 40ish hour a week desk job. I've even stopped doing side work. I'm still involved with one local group, but I'd barely call it that at this point. I usually dread going and show up at the very end of monthly events and barely interact with others. I'm frustrated and tired. I've talked to mutiple doctors, a few pcps, my adhd doctor, counsolors, had bloodwork done, and various tests and idk what to do anymore. 

I dont drink it much anymore, but coffee relaxes me. Adderall/Ritalin has helped with focus but not in any real way with motivation or energy. Kratom has been the only thing that I've found that helps with energy. I'd love for some doctor to actually find something and fix it. I'd really rather not need any medication or treatment that's daily. As that doesnt seem like its going to happen, I need more options. This is messing up so much rn. 

I'm barely doing anything besides work. I've stopped showering regularly, don't go do anything, and am sleeping through my work alarms atleast once a month, if not 2-3 times. All I do is go to the gas station, work, and sit in bed with a tv show I've zoned out playing in the background (I sometimes watch the same episode 5 times before I actually see it), eat once or twice a day, play a game on my phone, clean the house, and sleep. I'm not talking to people even on social media anymore and have just disconnected from everything and keep trying to find something/someone that helps. I don't know what else I can do. I miss me and I have no idea how to get back to that again.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of cha pu erh tea hinges on several critical features that contribute to its overall taste,aroma,and aging potential.

**Tea Source and Region:**
The origin of the tea leaves plays a pivotal role in the final product. The prized leaves come from old-growth tea trees in Yunnan Province, specifically from regions like Yiwu, Bulang, and Menghai. These areas are known for their unique terroir, which imparts distinct characteristics to the tea. Higher elevations and mineral-rich soils contribute to the complexity and richness of the tea leaves.

**Processing Method:**
The processing method significantly differentiates raw (sheng) and ripe (shou) pu erh. Sheng pu erh undergoes natural fermentation over many years, resulting in a vibrant, grassy, and slightly bitter flavor.Shou pu erh, on the other hand, undergoes accelerated fermentation in a humid and controlled surroundings, yielding an earthy, smooth, and often sweet taste within a short period. The skill and precision in controlling the fermentation process are crucial for producing high-quality shou pu erh.

**Age and Storage:**
The age of the tea, especially sheng pu erh, greatly influences its flavor profile. Young sheng pu erh is characterized by its astringency, while aged sheng pu erh develops a smoother, sweeter, and more complex taste with subtle nuances. Storage conditions such as humidity,temperature,and ventilation affect the aging process. Proper storage allows the tea to develop its desirable characteristics while preventing spoilage.

**Leaf Grade and Appearance:**
The grade of the tea leaves,categorized by the plucking standard (e.g., one bud and two leaves), affects the tea's body and flavor. Teas made from younger, tender leaves tend to be more delicate and aromatic. The appearance of the tea leaves can also indicate quality. High-quality sheng pu erh typically has leaves that are dark green with silver tips, while shou pu erh leaves are usually dark brown or reddish-brown.

**Compression Method:**
Cha pu erh is typically compressed into cakes, bricks, or tuo cha for ease of storage and aging. The compression method can affect the rate and uniformity of fermentation. loose leaf pu erh is also available, but compressed forms are more common for long-term storage. The density of the compression can influence the tea's aging characteristics.

**Aroma and Flavor Profile:**
The aroma and flavor profile are key indicators of the tea's overall quality.High-quality sheng pu erh typically exhibits aromas of floral, fruity, and woody notes, with a complex taste that evolves over time. Shou pu erh offers earthy, mushroomy, and sometimes chocolatey aromas, with a smooth and mellow taste. The absence of off-flavors or unpleasant aromas is essential for a good cha pu erh tea.

long story short, was on bumble, matched with this guy, he automatically seemed so strange and not the type to go for me - like he was really fit and I felt really ugly near him so I just send one word replies incase he was just messaging me to be nice and hoping it would fizzle out! He wants to meet me the next day for a date and I say yes.... but I automatically get the feeling he wants to ghost and he seems so standoffish with his texts on the day of but he does actually turn up on the date - we get drunk and sleep together but it deffo doesn't feel like a one night stand as he just gives me his shirt to sleep in, gives water, cuddles at night which is cute but deffo a bit much and felt a bit relationshippy for me which I didnt like as I honestly just didnt think it was right to go that far romantically, but I consented to sex

We arrange a second date and then he tells me things like ""I wouldn't meet everyone like this"" and insinuates, well basically, tells me he likes me, accuses me of leading him on, and basically tells me that I seem like the type to cheat. He also starts mentioning his ex, that she's an influencer, and that they broke things off because she booked a wedding venue behind his back??? and I just sit there like... why am I hearing this, and I suggest therapy in order to work through his feelings because honestly I got really overwhelmed and didnt feel comfortable with the intensity of it all

Long story short, I tell him I want something casual or just friendship, or if he's not comfortable with that, we can stop seeing each other, because I feel like he has trauma from his ex but we were definitely in our feels for one another - but he starts getting jealous and controlling, putting me down on my birthday, like really coming out with insults alot of the time, tells me I dont know what ""responsibility"" looks like, despite me being a young carer, and having far more responsibilities than him financially, emotionally, and work wise. He then starts ignoring me, and when we finally discuss things he tells me he can't give me the attention I need and that he needs therapy and he wants to cut things off, which I agree with, but then asks to meet for coffee as friends, then the next day says he wants to cut things off again! He made me cry for four hours with a barrage of insults and honestly it gets to the point where I felt so uncomfortable I couldn't drive properly day of him ending it all, so someone kindly escorted me to a nearby school (im 27 btw haha) and said they would drop me home after - the matron comes out to calm me down and tells me he is domestically abusing me and its not on and he was controlling me and so many people raised concerns on his behaviour. I just feel so confused and concerned as all I wanted to do was defend him.

I then find out his instagram still has pictures of his ex from four years ago... his ex's profile is full and absolutely full of photos of him and she has like 200k followers, and I am absolutely embarrassed and flabbergasted that I even thought he was remotely over his ex - he was even using cropped photos of himself from him and his ex on his dating profile, and expressed how much he resented her - I deffo feel like I was used to be a revenge tactic on his ex as he put so much pressure on me to perform perfectly eg. in bed, in public, lose weight etc.

The worst part is that I still miss him because I felt like I had to help him and I didnt want him to go through this alone, and he resents me so much for setting boundaries so I feel like its my fault - Im really looking for explanation and closure!!x",2,1749266100.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

**Five Payoffs You’ll Get**

**1. See AI as your Super-Assistant**

* The guide shows how to off-load three work killers, repetitive grunt work, skill bottlenecks, and “where-do-I-start?” ambiguity, so you spend more time on strategy.

**2. A One-Page Framework to Spot Easy Wins**

* Almost every real-world use case slots into one of these categories: Content Creation, Research, Data Analysis, Ideation & Strategy, Automation, and (if you feel brave) Coding. Use the list to brainstorm where AI can help your own workflow.

**3. Proof That First Drafts Save Real Hours**

* Promega chopped 135 hours off email production in six months by letting ChatGPT crank out first drafts, then polishing in-house. You can replicate that tomorrow.

**4. A Two-Axis Prioritization Map**

* The Impact-vs-Effort matrix helps you rank ideas, nail “high-ROI focus” projects, and shelve the shiny but time-sucking ones.

**5. A Vision for Full-Workflow Automation**

* The last section sketches how teams chain AI from deep research → data crunch → ideation → copy → auto-localization. It’s a teaser of where marketing ops is headed.

**Why It’s Worth Your Coffee Break**

* Zero jargon: Written for business users, not engineers.
* Field-tested: Draws from 600+ enterprise use cases, so you skip guesswork.
* Action items on almost every page: You’ll leave with prompts and checklists you can copy-paste into tomorrow’s stand-up.
* Momentum builder: Quick wins earn internal buy-in, which unlocks budget for bigger bets.

I’m here to learn from actual users.

**What I’m building:**

It’s called **Flexi** — think of it as an AI-powered spreadsheet-meets-database interface, but designed to connect and work with real business data. I’ve spent the last few months building the core product in a way to make it as *flexi*ble as possible and currently only support 1 integration, which is Google Sheets. The goal now is to bring that same power to **Shopify** — importing product data, analyzing customer trends, enriching order info, generating insights, and automating repetitive workflows.

Here's a link to the product linked to the ecommerce use case: [https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce](https://www.tryflexi.app/use-cases/ecommerce)

**Why I’m building it:**

I’ve worked with a few small Shopify stores before and kept seeing the same frustrations come up:

* “I wish I could just bulk edit all these product fields easily.”
* “I want to segment customers better but Shopify’s built-in filters are limited.”
* “Exporting reports is a pain, and I don’t want to write Liquid or build custom dashboards.”
* “I spend hours manually updating things that I feel AI could just handle.”
* ""I want to make my own custom images quickly based on my products""

So instead of building another dashboard or app with narrow features, I’m trying to build an interface where you can pull in your Shopify data, supercharge it with AI, generate new images and content in seconds, and even automate actions with AI help.

**What I would love from you:**

I’m *not* trying to pitch a paid product. What I *am* looking for are real Shopify users who are willing to try it out, break it, push the limits, and tell me:

* Where it sucks
* What’s confusing
* What would make it 10x more useful for your store
* What data or actions matter most to *you*
* *How exactly* you would want an integration to work for you

If you’re someone who’s juggling products, orders, customer data, or reports and wish there was a faster way to manage or analyze things, I’d love to chat or invite you to try the early version.

# Best Consignment Classics Home Furnishings [2025 Guide]

Consignment classics home furnishings represent a smart and sustainable approach to decorating your home. These pre-owned pieces, often sourced from high-end brands and crafted with superior materials, offer a unique blend of affordability, quality, and style. For budget-conscious homeowners, eco-conscious consumers, and design enthusiasts alike, consignment furniture provides an opportunity to acquire timeless pieces that add character and sophistication to any living space. This guide explores the benefits, key considerations, and best practices for navigating the world of consignment classics in 2025.

[[Browse top-rated consignment classics home furnishings on Amazon]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-products/?kw=consignment+classics+home+furnishings)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of consignment classics home furnishings lies in several key features that distinguish them from mass-produced, new furniture.

**Quality Craftsmanship:** Often, consignment pieces are from an era where furniture construction emphasized durability and longevity. These items feature solid wood frames, intricate joinery, and high-quality upholstery that are rarely found in contemporary, budget-friendly options. You can find pieces made of hardwoods like mahogany, walnut, or cherry, built to withstand years of use.

The superior construction of these pieces also means they can be more easily restored or reupholstered, extending their lifespan and allowing you to customize them to fit your personal style. This contrasts sharply with many modern furniture items designed for planned obsolescence.

**Unique Style and Character:** Consignment stores offer a diverse range of styles, from antique Victorian pieces to mid-century modern designs. This variety allows you to create a truly unique and personalized home aesthetic that reflects your individual taste.

Unlike the uniformity often found in retail furniture stores, consignment shops provide the opportunity to discover one-of-a-kind items that tell a story and add character to your space. These pieces can become conversation starters and focal points within your home's design.

**Sustainability:** Choosing consignment furniture is an environmentally responsible decision. By purchasing pre-owned items, you are reducing the demand for new furniture production, which requires significant resources and energy.

This reduces deforestation, lowers carbon emissions associated with manufacturing and transportation, and minimizes landfill waste. Consignment promotes a circular economy, extending the life cycle of furniture and diverting usable items from ending up in landfills.

**Affordability:** One of the most compelling reasons to consider consignment furniture is the significant cost savings. You can often find high-quality, designer pieces at a fraction of their original retail price.

This allows you to furnish your home with pieces that would otherwise be financially out of reach. The price reduction reflects the fact that the furniture is pre-owned, but often the wear and tear is minimal, especially for pieces that have been well-maintained.

**Potential for Investment:** Certain vintage or antique consignment pieces can appreciate in value over time, making them a potential investment. This is especially true for items from renowned designers or manufacturers.

Researching the history and provenance of a piece can help you identify items with the potential to increase in value. While not all consignment furniture will become valuable, the possibility adds another layer of appeal to the search.

**Immediate Availability:** Unlike ordering new furniture that can take weeks or months to arrive, consignment pieces are typically available for immediate purchase and delivery. This is particularly beneficial for those who need to furnish a home quickly or are impatient to start enjoying their new acquisitions.

The instant gratification of finding the perfect piece and bringing it home right away is a significant advantage over the delayed gratification of ordering new furniture.

 ## Core Benefits

Consignment classics offer a range of practical benefits that appeal to a wide audience.

**Enhanced Home Aesthetics:** By incorporating consignment classics into your home decor, you can elevate the overall aesthetic and create a more sophisticated and personalized living space. The unique styles and character of these pieces add depth and visual interest that mass-produced furniture often lacks.

Imagine a living room featuring a beautifully restored antique coffee table paired with a modern sofa. The juxtaposition of old and new creates a dynamic and visually appealing space that reflects your individual taste and style.

**Eco-Friendly Living:** Choosing consignment furniture is a conscious decision that aligns with sustainable living practices. By reducing your consumption of new products, you are minimizing your environmental impact and contributing to a more sustainable future.

Each piece of consignment furniture saved from a landfill represents a reduction in resource consumption and waste generation. This small act can collectively contribute to a larger movement towards environmental responsibility.

**Budget-Friendly Decorating:** Consignment shopping allows you to furnish your home with high-quality pieces without breaking the bank. You can often find designer furniture and unique antiques at significantly lower prices than their retail counterparts.

This means you can achieve a high-end look without spending a fortune. The money saved can be used for other home improvement projects or simply kept in your savings account.

 ## FAQs Section

**How do I assess the quality and condition of consignment furniture?**

Carefully inspect the furniture for any signs of damage, such as scratches, dents, or stains. Check the structural integrity of the piece by testing the stability of the frame and joints. Examine the upholstery for wear and tear, and consider the cost of reupholstering if necessary. Don't hesitate to ask the consignment store staff for more information about the history and condition of the item.

**What are the best types of consignment stores for finding classic home furnishings?**

Look for consignment stores that specialize in furniture or home decor. These stores are more likely to carry a wider selection of high-quality, classic pieces. Check online reviews and ratings to gauge the store's reputation and customer satisfaction. Visit multiple stores to compare prices and selection.

**How can I negotiate the price of consignment furniture?**

Politely inquire about the possibility of negotiating the price, especially if you find any flaws or imperfections. Offer a reasonable price based on your research and the condition of the item. Be prepared to walk away if the store is unwilling to negotiate. Cash payments may sometimes result in a better price.

**What should I consider when transporting consignment furniture?**

Measure the furniture and ensure it will fit through doorways and hallways in your home. Consider hiring a professional moving company to transport large or heavy items. Protect the furniture with blankets or padding during transport to prevent damage. Inspect the furniture for any new damage upon arrival.

Very nice, pretty quiet fella. B doesn’t ask for much, but other CNAs in my facility seem like they don’t like him very much. He’ll press his call light and it will be one they answer last because they think he presses it too much. (note: B presses his call light maybe twice a shift, way less than many others) Its usually not for anything important, but damn. Once he pressed it to ask for coffee, I answered and went to get him some and on my way out his door he says “be careful!! I don’t want you to burn yourself, take your time” and I literally wanted to bawl. Hes like that all the time with me, so I can’t fathom anyone not liking him. I always tell him goodnight when I’m leaving, and he grabs my hand for a moment and says goodnight back. The only possible annoyance from him ever is sometimes he will repeatedly ask you to take him to his room (part of his care plan requires him to stay in the social areas) and he gets very concerned about not knowing where his room is, but he’s never mean and just needs a little reassurance you will take him there when you can. I will say he does probably treat me nicer than other CNAs because the favoritism between us is mutual, I am definitely his favorite. He says I make the best coffee (regardless of how I make it, sometimes I forget he likes 2 sugars 2 creamers and bring him black coffee and he drinks it without complaint).  He’s a major choking risk but I feel like everyone should get the opportunity to have a snack between a meal if they want it, so if he is interested I usually sit with him while he eats a cookie or something (during a slow period in the day, he’s patient) because he’s not allowed to eat in his room by himself.

I’m looking for recommendations for a Facebook group where families can find nannies — but ideally one that truly advocates for both sides, not just one. I absolutely believe in paying caregivers what they’re worth, especially when they’re experienced, responsible, and genuinely engaged with the kids. That said, I’d love to find a group where rates are more thoughtfully discussed — based on a nanny’s background, approach to care, and value they bring — not just the idea that “nanny care is a luxury” or “I’ve been nannying for 10 years, so I charge $30/hour.”

I say this with full respect and as someone who has been on both sides — I’ve worked in daycares, I’ve nannied, babysat, and now I work professionally in my career. I went to school for 4 years, I continue to grow in my field, and I earn just a little over $30/hour. So when I’m paying someone $20–$30/hour — which is a professional wage — I expect a level of care that matches that: structure, engagement, development, not just supervision.

And while I’ve had fantastic nannies who absolutely deserved top rates, I’ve also experienced the opposite. Too often I’ve seen nannies who take kids out, meet up with other nannies, grab coffee, sit on a bench chatting — and barely interact with the children. In those situations, the kids aren’t really learning or being engaged — it becomes more of a social outing for the nanny than a developmental experience for the child. Meanwhile, parents are at work, completely unaware, assuming they’re paying for personalized care that’s better than daycare — when in reality, sometimes daycare may offer more structure and stimulation.

What also concerns me is how often rates are adjusted for “cost of living” every 6 months in some groups, as if everyone’s care level or responsibilities automatically change. Most of us in traditional jobs don’t get raises that often unless there’s a significant change in performance or role.

So I’m really just looking for a group — or a conversation — that reflects both sides honestly. One that values great caregivers (and I know there are many), but also understands that not all care is equal, and not every nanny justifies $30/hour simply because they’ve been in the field for a while.

If you know of a group like this or have thoughts, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. My goal is always to give my child the best care — and make fair, informed decisions.

1l5ampm,https://i.redd.it/trehpwr76f5f1.jpeg,Carajillo Mead,"Hey everyone wanted to share my second batch of Mead that turned out great. I tried to do a spin on a Carajillo flavor (espresso and liquor 43 cocktail)

I did a lot of reading from the group to figure out how to impart a coffee flavor into my Mead and glad to say it worked out great! 

Here's how I did it so that you all can try for yourselves. 

Recipe:
3 gallon carboy
6lbs of Mesquite honey (previous coffee Meads recommended dark honey variants)
2 gallons of water
1 mango jack M05 yeast
Starting SG 1.09
Ferment for 5 weeks, I achieved a final SG of .994 for a 14.5% alcohol content. 

Siphon to next Carboy for secondary
Add potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfate to end the yeast
Next place carboy in fridge and let it cool overnight. From here we are doing a cold brew with the mead. Grab 12oz of your favorite medium roast as whole beans (others stated that ground beans will impart more bitterness into the Mead) place it into the Mead with a brewers bag. I found that 5 days added a great amount of coffee flavor but did not over power the mead. 

Final step is adding the liquor 43 to match the Carajillo flavor. In the cocktail it's 1 to 1 ratio espresso vs liquor. The liquor itself is very sweet so this brought back the sweetness into the Mead. Doing a lot of testing of working up the amount of liquor 43 to Mead ratio, I found the sweet spot at 1mL to 14.6mL. if you add too little you make all the flavor mute and the Mead is very bland, if you add to much you get a sweeter mead and lose some of the nice caramels and vanillas from the mesquite honey. So I found this to be the perfect ratio. I had 7884mL of Mead and added 540mL of liquor 43. Rounded out the full alcohol percentage to be 15.5%

Overall this is a great attempt and a unique drink. If you are a fan of espresso martinis the Carajillo is a close cousin. This Mead is still truly a mesquite mead but has a nice espresso flavor journey in the middle followed by nice long caramel vanilla and light coffee after tastes. ",7,1749264754.0,mead,1,1.0,False

1l5ags4,https://www.reddit.com/r/northcounty/comments/1l5ags4/looking_for_friends_in_san_diego/,Looking for friends in San Diego,"Hey everyone! I’m a 27-year-old woman living in San Diego. I’m a nursing student and former vet tech, and I’d really love to make some new female friends. I’m especially hoping to connect with other women in their 20s or 30s who love dogs, being outside, and are open to trying new things.

A bit about me:

Huge dog lover (I have a sweet and energetic golden retriever and Australian shepherd )
I enjoy hiking, beach walks, trying new cafes, and exploring 
I’m into reading especially rom-coms 
I can be a bit introverted at first, but I’m genuinely looking to build some meaningful friendships and get out of my comfort zone
If you’re also looking to expand your circle, maybe meet up for coffee, a dog walk, or even a chill book hang  send me a message or comment! 😊",8,1749264214.0,northcounty,4,0.78,False
1l5agrd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5agrd,Before & After of my bedroom,"Hi everyone! First time posting here. Enjoy my 'Before & After' of my bedroom. My overall goal was to transform my room into a 'lounge' and chill type of environment rather than a typical looking bedroom. I also wanted to make it feel more grown up. Still playing around with some of the decor here and there, as you can tell by some of the pictures. To start off, the area by the window was calling for a reading nook, so my dad and I bought 3 coffee tables from IKEA, cut them to size & made a nook. The nook also acts as my bed, which I dress up with sheets at night. I'm not that tall so I can comfortably squeeze in at night. What really makes the room pop in my opinion, is the projector. I can put virtually any scene, video or movie on the wall to fit whatever aesthetic I am feeling in that moment. Youtube has some awesome window projections that I use often. The star light protectors add some extra 'pizzazz' which really looks cool at night. Still need to add some personal touches on the other walls (not seen) such as pictures and white floating shelves.",60,1749264213.0,interiordecorating,17,0.94,False

The next day i had a birthday party to go to and the plan was for Andrea to leave. but she insisted on staying with my sister. i thought it was weird but i said yes thinking she would leave. she stayed for four more days where they hung out in my room, slept in my bed, went on my roof, and used stuff in my room. they left food everywhere, and the next time Andrea came over they watched a movie in my bedroom. i eventually asked Andrea if we could talk about it because i felt so frustrated. i told her how my sister and i don't have a good relationship and i wasn't comfortable with how they used all my things without asking. Andrea was at the gym at the time, and i later found out my sister was there as well. Andrea read my whole text to my sister where i was literally talking about our relationship. Andrea said she didn't understand why i was so upset and dismissed it. fast forward to now, Andrea likes my sister better than me. they are constantly together, her Instagram posts are mainly of them, and i don't get a chance to hangout alone with Andrea without my sister OR little brother who's 11 years old. when im with her i get frustrated about little things because of how much built up anger i have of being replaced with my own sister. my mom got mad at me for not liking them being friends. my whole family worships Andrea. she recently texted me because she was upset that I seemed mad at her. i explained i have a ton of anger built up from her being best friends with my siblings. she said ""just because you guys don't have a good relationship doesn't mean i can't be close with her"" but it's just so weird to me. it is so disrespectful because she knows im so uncomfortable with it. another thing is Andrea doesn't pay for anything. im the one buying coffees and paying for the things we do. she sometimes asks for five rides a day from me. i don't know how to deal with this because she will not consider my feelings and also my whole family loves her more than me.",9,1749264154.0,AmITheJerk,3,1.0,False

Con mi novia hicimos una app para iOS y Android, se llama Dogma. 

Básicamente te muestra casi todos los eventos de fiesta electrónica que hay en Argentina. Te linkea también con afters al evento al que vas a ir, si es que hay disponible. Podés filtrar eventos por ubicación, rango de fecha, tipo de evento (main, sunset, after, coffee rave) y comodidades (gratis y/o si tiene parking). Hace poco también hicimos acuerdo con una compañía llamada Tu Traslado, y te mostramos si hay traslados disponibles para los eventos que vas a ir o te interesan.

Out of nowhere, a new starter on our broader team hops on a Teams call with another colleague who shares their ethnic background. At first, it’s just normal work chat—cool, whatever.

Then, out of the blue, the new starter starts going off about how education is “so cheap back home,” how they “can’t believe people pay so much to study in Australia,” and how most folks end up “driving taxis or working in servos which make them so desperate to take up any job just to be in Australia.” They even started making generalizations about people coming from Northern regions being more desperate to move to Australia than Southern people. They were make few obnoxious and ignorant comments throwing a shade that Indian Cannot speak english and want to gain PR in Australia and that they don't see them as right fit.

Honestly, I was just trying to enjoy my coffee, but this whole rant was so ignorant and awkward. The kicker? This person only moved to Australia from NZ a few months ago, worked there for less than months, married a guy from NZ, and now suddenly has this wannabe Aussie accent and fake engagement energy.

A few of us sitting nearby just exchanged “WTF” glances. I usually mind my own business, but this was next-level. I’ve never heard anyone go off like that in the office before.

  I actually had my bag weight at around 55lbs and decided to ruck around my local park for half an hour before I decided to strip some weight off, thank goodness. 
   I am 250 lbs and not obese, I’m a developed strength athlete so I think I can handle a little more weight than most but I would still appreciate a sub-35 pack when loaded with water and whatnot for these long hikes. 


    I’ll end this with some questions for y’all-


   Has anybody had experience with binoculars on hikes? If I’m interested in wildlife observation is it worth an extra 3-5 lbs? 
   How about NVG’s? I have a gen 3 monocular and would LOVE to stare at some of the stars with no light pollution with a low light monocular, but if it has to go then it has to go.
   I don’t know if I have hyper hydrosis or if I just sweat a lot but water is a concern for me. Is it worth packing an extra liter or two despite the weight?


If you read all of this THANK YOU, I am literally trusting you with my life, but more importantly I am trusting you with my summer break!

Owners definitely don’t live here. Gas range burners very persnickety, sometimes light sometimes don’t. No corkscrew. No salt and pepper, but 3 different kinds of artificial sweetener. Many plastic kitchen utensils burned/melted. When we arrived there was a fair amount of food in the fridge and crumbs in the fridge drawers. Tonight after fully loading the dishwasher find that it seems to be disconnected from power source. No remedy for this. There’s no dish rack for hand washing so every counter is covered with paper towels and dishes. The owner told me he was out of town and we should leave our dirty dishes for him to take care of after we leave. I told him I would not be comfortable with that and I’d like to pick up a dish rack since we will be hand washing for the next 4 nights. Ok so here’s my question for you hosts: do you care if an experienced guest lets you know things? Like don’t put the k-cups on the highest shelf, put them near a coffee maker? Like if you are charging $400 per night in a resort are maybe your guests would like a full length mirror? Have a check list of kitchen necessities and check before every rental? In a high end property, polyester sheets bring the comfort level way down? I’ve read here that leaving less than a five star review is mortally wounding a host, but what is a frustrated renter to do in these less-than-egregious but disappointing/frustrating situations?",4,1749263137.0,airbnb_hosts,6,0.75,False

I’m in my mid 20s and my fiance and I have a 1 year old. I have a bachelors degree but,I really value my work life balance right now since my baby is so young. I work at a coffee shop in Washington making about 23-27 an hour after tips. 

What I like about the stand is that it’s pretty easy work, the “hardest” thing is taking out the garbage lol. I also really like my hours, I work 4 hour shifts, Thursday-Saturday. 

What I don’t like about the stand is the lack of benefits (no 401k) and mandatory working holidays as they are open 365 days a year 😵

My fiance is the bread winner, but we want to buy a house in a few years so I want to help pay off debts. I’ve only worked at the coffee shop for about a month lol but I got offered the Apple retail position and I’m torn because I enjoy the relaxed coffee environment and I’m worried Apple won’t be as relaxed.

What do you all think? Any Apple employees here? 

I’m leaning more towards Apple because I really love their benefits and it looks better on my resume.

I happen to be taking a little road trip to the closest city with an IKEA tomorrow, so I am going to stop there to look. I think I'm going to get the RANARP floor lamp at least. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",8,1749262628.0,DesignMyRoom,14,1.0,False
