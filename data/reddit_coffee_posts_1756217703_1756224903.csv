1n0q2t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n0q2t5/should_you_buy_the_best_countertop_blender/,Should You Buy the Best Countertop Blender Breville Super Q,"Reviewing the Breville BBL920BSS Super Q blender has been quite an enlightening experience for me. This commercial-grade blender practically screams efficiency and power while maintaining a design that feels right at home in any modern kitchen. It’s been touted as one of the strongest blenders in its category, and after giving it a go in my kitchen over the past few weeks, I can safely say, it certainly lives up to most of the claims! Whether you're blending smoothies, crushing ice, or preparing soups, this machine tackles it all with electric muscle and finesse.

**Power and Performance**

The Breville Super Q stands out for its raw power. With an 1800-watt motor and a blade tip speed reaching up to 186mph under load, I’ve found this blender capable of handling just about anything I throw into it. Crushing frozen bananas and ice cubes has become an effortless task, which was a lifesaver during summer mornings when smoothies were on repeat. Even better, it doesn’t just pulverize—it maintains the texture of ingredients like a seasoned chef. The 12 speed settings allow for precise control, which really came in handy when emulsifying creams or grinding coffee beans.

**Ease of Use**

I have to say, even with so much power packed inside, this blender doesn’t intimidate. The digital controls are straightforward and user-friendly, featuring five one-touch programs that can handle everything from smoothies to soups with zero manual tinkering. It was especially fun experimenting with the soup function, which miraculously turned cold ingredients into steaming hot soup in just six minutes. The auto-clean function was an unexpected gem. With just a press of a button, the blender’s jug and blades were cleaned using warm water and a dab of soap—no hassle and no mess. 

**Highlights**

- An elegant, brushed stainless steel finish that looks modern while resisting fingerprints
- A 68-ounce copolyester jug for those family-sized smoothie mornings 
- Noise suppression technology that noticeably muffles the often-ear-splitting sound of most blenders
- BPA-free materials that are reassuring for anyone cautious about food safety

Personally, the noise suppression feature has been a godsend. I've had blenders in the past that sent my dog running every time they turned on. This one doesn’t stir the same chaos, and that alone makes me want to keep it on my countertop forever.

**Shortcomings**

While it excels in many areas, there are some points worth a mention that might be drawbacks for certain users:

- It’s heavy. At nearly 15.5 pounds, moving it back and forth from storage to the counter was not something I particularly enjoyed.
- Price might be a sticking point for some, especially when compared with mid-range options.
- The additional accessories, like the Vac Q vacuum pump, need to be purchased separately, which adds to the already premium cost.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this blender to other top-notch contenders like the Vitamix A3500 or Blendtec 725, Breville's offering carves its own niche. While the Vitamix boasts incredible reliability and comes with extensive pre-programmed options, Breville holds its ground with its noise-suppression feature and soup functionality. I’ve also found the Breville's digital interface more intuitive than that of the Blendtec, which can feel dated at times. However, for those focused purely on raw motor performance, Blendtec’s high-speed power could be a marginally better pick. On the flip side, the Breville Super Q feels like the most balanced choice for versatility and usability.

**Affordable Quality**

For anyone assessing performance against price, there’s a solid argument to be made here. This blender justifies its cost through its sheer power, adaptability, and silence while being operated. It’s ideal for someone who needs a day-in and day-out workhorse in the kitchen, capable of everything from simple shakes to restaurant-quality sauces. That said, for casual users who just want an occasional smoothie or don’t care about programmable options, a less expensive model might suffice.

I recently finished reading [All the Devils Are Here - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/all-the-devils-are-here-louise-penny/) and I just had to share my thoughts with you all. If you're looking for a compelling mystery that's also a deep dive into human nature, pull up a chair and let's chat about this one.

---

**What's It All About? (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

So, this book takes Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, his wife Reine-Marie, and the rest of his family out of their beloved Three Pines and drops them right into the heart of Paris. They're there for the birth of a new grandchild, a happy occasion that quickly turns dark when Gamache's billionaire godfather, Stephen Horowitz, is attacked and seemingly targeted. Suddenly, Gamache isn't just a guest; he's embroiled in a deeply personal investigation that brings up old family secrets, corporate intrigue, and a whole lot of questions about who Stephen Horowitz really is. It’s a classic Penny setup: a mystery that's far more than just ""who did it.""

---

**What I Absolutely Loved**

First off, **the setting!** Paris is almost a character itself. Louise Penny describes the city with such vivid detail, you can almost smell the coffee and feel the ancient cobblestones under your feet. It's a wonderful contrast to the cozy, familiar Three Pines, and it really adds to the sense of disorientation and danger for Gamache.

The **characters** continue to be the heart of these books. Gamache is as thoughtful and morally grounded as ever, and seeing him grapple with a case that strikes so close to home is incredibly compelling. The family dynamics are front and center here, and Penny does a fantastic job exploring the complexities of family bonds, loyalty, and the secrets we keep. I especially appreciated how the existing characters evolve and react under pressure.

Penny's **writing style** is just beautiful. It’s elegant, rich, and full of wisdom. She weaves in philosophical insights and observations about life that elevate the story beyond a simple whodunit. The **pacing** is more of a slow burn, but in the best possible way. It allows you to really sink into the story, ponder the clues, and connect with the emotional depth of the characters. This isn't a book you rush through; it's one you savor.

---

**A Couple of Things to Consider**

Now, while I adored this book, it's worth mentioning a couple of points. If you prefer your thrillers to be non-stop action from page one, this might feel a little slower for you. Penny focuses a lot on character development and the internal lives of her characters, which I love, but it might not be for every reader. Also, if you're completely new to the Chief Inspector Gamache series, you *can* read this as a standalone, but you'll definitely appreciate the nuances and character histories much more if you've read some of the earlier books. That said, it's still a strong story on its own merits!

---

**Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!**

Yes, without a doubt! I wholeheartedly recommend [All the Devils Are Here - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/all-the-devils-are-here-louise-penny/) to anyone who enjoys a sophisticated mystery.

**Who is this book for?**
*   Fans of character-driven mysteries and psychological thrillers.
*   Readers who appreciate beautiful prose and thoughtful storytelling.
*   Anyone who loves to ""travel"" through books, especially to Paris!
*   If you're looking for a mystery that makes you think and feel, rather than just delivering jump scares.
*   Those who enjoy authors like Tana French, P.D. James, or Agatha Christie (but with more modern depth).

---

**A Little Guide for New Readers (or Just Anyone!)**

If you're new to reading mysteries like this, or even just getting into reading more, here are some friendly tips:

1.  **Don't Rush It:** These books are meant to be savored. Allow yourself to get lost in the descriptions and the characters' thoughts. Don't feel pressured to finish quickly.
2.  **Embrace the ""Slow Burn"":** Some of the best mysteries build tension gradually. Trust the author to lead you through the story. The payoff is usually worth it!
3.  **Find Your Comfort Zone:** If you find yourself enjoying the atmosphere or a specific character, lean into that! It helps you connect with the story on a deeper level.
4.  **It's Okay to Not Know:** You don't need to figure out the mystery before the detective does. Enjoy the ride of discovery alongside the characters.
5.  **Talk About It!** Reading can be a solitary activity, but discussing books with others (like here on Reddit!) can really enhance the experience.

So, if you're looking for your next great read, definitely consider picking up [All the Devils Are Here - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/all-the-devils-are-here-louise-penny/). It's a gripping, emotional, and beautifully written mystery that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page.

I live somewhere where the public transport is good and I had no need for it (nor the money. It's very expensive in Ireland). 

I bought my own first car 3 months ago after saving up. It sat in the driveway long enough for it to need a jumpstart as I had spent the summer travelling. Learning about insurance, car maintenance etc is something I have to do all on my own. It's been insured for a couple of weeks now. I finally got it out of the driveway and around my neighbourhood today, and all on my own :) Just getting used to the clutch and the sensitivity of the pedals.

The biggest thing for me to tackle is the anxiety. I have an anxiety disorder, so it makes me disproportionately anxious, even over things I know I'm capable of doing. I drive manual, and this is the 6th car I've had to learn how to drive within the past 2 years, so it's a big learning curve each time, which doesn't help. 

I feels quite shameful to have taken so long to properly get out on the road on my own at all. Anybody else who struggles with an anxiety disorder knows, it takes going at your own pace. I'm not quite where I want to be just yet, but I'm very far from where I was :) My next goal is to drive to my local coffee shop on my own and see where I go from there.",2,1756224332.0,driving,0,1.0,False

Which apartment should I choose?,"Hi all - I (28F) am moving to Chicago from out of state (second week of September) and need help deciding between two condos. I wrote a bit about myself and the options below. 

I have two amazing (1B/1B) condo options, but one is $320 more a month, and I’m not sure the amazing location of it is worth the price difference. They’re both technically within budget, but the more-expensive one is at the higher-end. I have a realtor helping me since I’m out of state, and she’s toured them while on FaceTime with me. My friends who live in chi also walked around and checked out the places/areas for me and approved of both. I have driven through both areas, but I’m not super familiar with all that’s nearby. Based on those of you familiar with the city/areas, which would you say is a better choice for me?

About me: 28/F, single (actively dating), and work in healthcare (in person). I have a dog and cat (ESAs). Things I enjoy: taking my dog to parks, trying new restaurants/coffee shops (def a foodie), fitness/working out (Pilates, yoga, lifting, walking/running), playing soccer, spending time at the beach/reading, socializing with friends, going to local events/meet ups/farmers markets, and traveling. I will go out every here and there, but I’m no party animal by any means. 

-Both units: Both are newly-updated units in condo high rises, amenities are comparable, mgmt is the same, almost all utilities included. Parking is $200 a month for the garages, but I’ll likely leave my car at a family member’s house outside of the city since both are a 10-15 min walk to the L. They’re both fairly equidistant to the hospital I’ll be working at and in close proximity to the lake. Both are on lower levels which is good since I sometimes take the steps when letting out my dog. Comparable app and moving fees.

#1) Apartment A: unicorn find (cost wise), on Clark near the border of old town and Lincoln park (right across from The park/zoo). Slightly bigger (about 50ish sq ft more), includes all utilities except electric, smaller (but functional) workout room, card/app laundry in the building. Within budget, just at the high end of it. Will be ~$300 more/month with electricity factored in. ~10 min longer to get to work via the L. A good friend lives ~14 min walking distance and has a car. Everything (shops etc) at my fingertips. Self parking if buying a monthly pass. 

#2) Apartment B: on Pine Grove near the northern border of Lakeview East. Includes all utilities except electric and gas, junior one bedroom (has separate area/walls for the bedroom, just no door), ~50 sq feet smaller than the other unit). ~$300 less/month with gas/electric factored in. 5-15 min walk from shops, etc. A tad closer to the L (by like 5 min). Larger workout room, coin laundry in the building. A good friend lives around ~15 min away and has a car. Valet parking (only option) if buying a monthly pass. 

Both seem like solid options, but I have no idea if the prime location in option A is worth the $300 more a month. Based on the information written about myself/the units, what would you recommend? If it was a smaller difference, I’d definitely go for the one on Clark, but I’m afraid to commit to it not knowing much about the vibe of the areas/what is nearby. 

Thanks so much in advance!!  All advice and input is much appreciated!!! 

Note - I have applications in for both since they are both first come first serve, rent is (thankfully) fixed because of that. I’m the first applicant for both, have approval for pets.  ",0,1756224229.0,chicagoapartments,1,0.5,False

Christian Walker has actually hit a Home Run in 3 of his last 5 games, and has snagged at least 1 base in 4 of those last 5. To be frank, I don’t expect Walker will have any issue bagging a double against starter Tanner Gordon. The Astros have yet to release their starting lineup, but assuming Walker is in it, this is the play.

* 🏔 **Rocky Mountaineer** – Luxury rail through Canada’s dramatic landscapes.
* 🌍 **Eurail & Global Rail Passes** – Hop between European cities at your own pace.

* **Full rail vacations** with hotels, excursions, and meals
* **Pre- or post-cruise/tour** rail add-ons to extend your trip

If you’ve ever dreamed about sipping coffee while watching mountain peaks, rivers, or vineyards roll past your window — rail travel might be your next adventure.

I’m 36, gay, married, and living in Arizona. By day I work in healthcare informatics, and by night I’m the grad student who apparently thought “sure, let’s make life busier.” Outside of that, you’ll usually find me paddle boarding, hiking, baking, brewery-hopping, or wandering through a theme park or some random corner of a city that feels like an adventure. Travel’s a big part of my life too — often in California and Michigan, but honestly open to wherever the connection takes me. I’m equally happy at a Night of the Living Dead double feature as I am with a quiet night in.

Life’s good — solid partner, steady job, overall pretty grounded. But the trickier part at this stage? Friendships that *fit*. Priorities shift, people grow, and sometimes your 20s crew doesn’t make the leap with you.

So if you’re also married or settled, doing your thing, but missing that “person” — the one you can laugh too loud with, vent to, or grab that unnecessary third coffee with — we might click.

Prked parking rental business. not gonna lie, this is a pretty solid opportunity for passive income in jacksonville. think about it. you can rent out your extra driveway space, garage, or even a spot in your yard. in jax, this is gold. you could offer short-term parking for people going to jaguars games near the stadium or concerts downtown. but the real money is in monthly parking. with so many people moving into new apartments and condos that might only have one parking spot, there's a huge need for monthly car or boat storage. especially around the naval bases like NAS Jax or Mayport, where people deploy and need a place to keep a vehicle. you're just listing your space on the Prked app and making money off something you already have. startup cost is basically zero.  
  
3. port and industrial park food truck. everyone wants to park their food truck in riverside or at the beaches, and that market is crowded. instead, take your truck to the places where thousands of people work every day: the port of jacksonville and the surrounding industrial parks. these guys are hungry and usually only have fast food options. bring a quality coffee and breakfast truck in the morning or a great cuban sandwich truck for lunch, and you'll have a loyal customer base. startup is the cost of a truck, maybe 20-50k to get going depending on what you buy.  
  
4. eco-focused boat tours. yeah, people do boat tours, but make it different. our st. johns river is an incredible ecosystem. offer guided kayak or small boat tours focused on the wildlife, the history of the river, and the conservation efforts. target both tourists and locals who are looking for cool experiences. with our younger population, experiences are everything. you'd need to invest in some kayaks or a boat and get your captain's license, so startup could be anywhere from 10k to 60k.  
  
5. corporate wellness provider. jacksonville has a huge number of people working in finance, healthcare, and insurance. these are stressful desk jobs. start a business that goes to corporate offices and offers things like 15-minute yoga sessions, mindfulness coaching, or healthy meal prep delivery. companies are actually looking for these kinds of perks to keep employees happy. startup is low, mostly based on your own certifications and marketing.  
  
6. high-end cleaning services. with the real estate market booming and so many people moving into new, expensive homes, the demand for cleaning services is high. don't just be a basic cleaning company. specialize in deep cleans for move-ins and move-outs, or offer premium services like window washing and pressure washing for the nicer neighborhoods. you could start this with a couple thousand dollars for supplies and insurance.  
  
7. senior care services. florida is full of retirees, and jacksonville is no exception. but it's not just about medical care. think about a service that offers companionship, runs errands, provides transportation to appointments, or helps with household chores. a lot of seniors are perfectly healthy but just need a little help to stay independent. this is a business with a lot of heart and a steady stream of clients.  
  
8. microbrewery. okay, this one's a little more common, but jax loves its craft beer. the key is to find a niche. maybe you specialize in sours or create a really cool, family-friendly tasting room in a neighborhood that doesn't have one yet. the startup cost is high, you're looking at well over 100k, but the payoff can be huge if you create a great local brand.  
  
9. hyper-local marketing agency. small businesses here are starting to realize that marketing to the entire city isn't effective. they need to target specific neighborhoods like san marco, avondale, or the beaches. if you're good at social media and digital ads, start an agency that specializes in this geo-targeted marketing. help local shops connect with the people right in their zip code. you can start this from your laptop for almost nothing.  
  
10. pet services. from dog walking to specialty pet bakeries, jacksonville loves its pets. with so many young professionals and families, people are willing to spend money on their furry friends. consider a mobile grooming service that goes to people's homes, or a doggy daycare that offers more than just a place to sit, like training and agility courses.  
  
so there you have it. just a few ideas to get you started. starting a business is tough but super rewarding, and jacksonville is a great place to do it right now. good luck.",1,1756223967.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

He also maintains a 'new music tuesday' playlist on Spotify which he adds to every week, so it's a good way to keep up with new good independent country releases.

How long did it take and how did it feel for you?,"I’ve currently got a 3 year toy poodle ex-breeding rescue who is showing signs of separation anxiety. It’s only day 2 so obviously she may settle quite a bit over the next few weeks but I do feel worried for her that she will struggle to find a home and that she will be at risk of being returned. Yesterday was quite tough as she wanted to be held constantly and was so distraught when I put her down (literally inconsolable, pure panic, and throwing herself back into my arms like a baby kangaroo), whereas today she is ok to just be near me but not on me. She does whine and bark if I leave the room for more than 20 seconds which I am still doing regularly in very small doses just to do normal things (make a coffee, go to the bathroom etc), however she had to sleep with me because she is just too distraught otherwise, which I know isn’t good to reinforce as not all adopters would be willing to continue this. So I guess my question is two things:

1) Are adopters willing to work with some separation anxiety in your experience? Is there a certain point I realistically need to try get her to?

2) How do you cope with the worry and guilt about not adopting them, knowing how much they’ve attached to you and how scared they will be to leave you?

hey guys, so i know the cost of living in san diego is insane and everyone's looking for a side hustle. thought i'd share some ways to make money online that actually work from here. i've tried a few of these myself. skip the boring survey sites, here's some real stuff.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one: online marketplace for local artisans. there are so many creative people in SD selling stuff at farmers markets in places like little italy or north park. you could create a simple website or etsy-style marketplace just for san diego makers to help them sell online. you'd take a small cut. it's a cool way to support local and make some cash off every sale without having to make anything yourself.  
  
2. local seo consultant for small businesses. honestly, every brewery, taco shop, and surf shop in this city needs help getting found on google maps. most owners are too busy to deal with it. if you can learn the basics of local seo (there's tons of free info out there), you can charge a monthly fee to manage their online listings and help them rank higher. pretty decent money in this.  
  
3. Prked parking space manager. okay hear me out. parking here is a nightmare, especially near the beach or downtown. if you have a driveway, garage, or even a spare spot in your lot, you can rent it out online with Prked. it's semi-passive income. you can manage the whole thing from your phone. think about the demand in pacific beach on a summer weekend, or monthly parking for people who live in apartments in hillcrest with no dedicated spot. you're basically using an online platform to rent out a physical space. its a solid online hustle for anyone in san diego with a patch of asphalt to spare.  
  
4. virtual assistant for biotech startups. san diego is a huge hub for biotech. a lot of these small companies and research labs need help with admin stuff – scheduling, emails, data entry – but don't want to hire a full-time person. you can do all of this from home as a virtual assistant. helps if you have some science background but not always necessary.  
  
5. creating tourist engagement content. this is more of a creative one. you could start a youtube channel, tiktok, or a blog that's hyper-focused on san diego tourism. not just the zoo and sea world, but cool neighborhood guides, where to find the best california burrito, secret surf spots, etc. you make money from ads, sponsorships with local businesses, or affiliate links for tours.  
  
6. online personal trainer for beach workouts. if you're into fitness, you don't need a gym. create workout plans that people can do at places like balboa park or on the beach. you can offer personalized coaching sessions online via video call and sell your workout guides as pdfs.  
  
7. managing social media for local food trucks. food trucks are everywhere here, from mira mesa to barrio logan. they need a good instagram presence to let people know where they'll be. you can manage their accounts, post cool pictures of their food, and engage with followers for a monthly fee. all done from your phone.  
  
8. dropshipping surf or skate gear. take advantage of the san diego lifestyle. you can set up an online store through something like shopify and sell beach-themed apparel, surf wax, skate wheels, whatever. you don't have to hold any inventory yourself, the supplier ships it directly to the customer.  
  
9. freelance writing or editing. this one's more general but it works well here. there's a big remote work scene in SD. you can find gigs writing content for websites, editing reports for companies, or even writing grant proposals for non-profits. it's flexible and you can do it from any of the thousand coffee shops in the city.  
  
10. online tutor for military families. with so many military bases around, there are a lot of families whose kids might need extra help with school, especially when they have to move frequently. you could offer online tutoring services in subjects like math or english.  
  
just a heads up, if you do start making money, you'll probably need a business tax certificate from the city of san diego. it's not too complicated to get.  
  
hope this helps someone out. it's definitely possible to build up a decent side income online from here to help with that san diego rent. good luck.",1,1756223672.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

That’s another thing! I don’t normally use cash but when I go out I use a debit card Why am I still getting charged a credit card fee? A lot of places say it does not matter that my card is a debit it’s still technically run as a credit card? Also, you have to be a paying customer to use the bathroom now? So many changes when grabbing food now. Just seems bizarre as times were much simpler a handful of years ago. Feels like owners are finding a way to charge for every little thing or make a rule for anything they can make a rule on or add a fee. I'm sure in the future there will be no more free wifi and there will be a charge for that. Probably a charge to use the bathroom also or to park in the parking lot.

3. What's the WiFi password??
4. How do I get slides or recordings?
5. How much does it cost?

The problem was, while I was giving a quick demo to one person, three others would walk away because they just wanted a price or a business card. We were losing people we couldn't talk to at that exact moment.

We needed a way for people to get these basic answers themselves, right there, without waiting for us.

So we built a simple thing to fix it.

You just type in your answers one time. The tool creates the page and the QR code for you. It’s completely customizable. You can even add your logo.

Now, when someone asks ""What's the WIFI password?"", we just point to the sign. They scan it, get the password, and we get to keep talking about what actually matters.

It saved us. I think it could save other teams, too.

We’re giving it away for free because, honestly, every event should have this. No strings attached.

I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile.

I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes.

1n0pgn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClubDiscussion/comments/1n0pgn3/interview_with_dmitry_the_author_of_te_amo/,INTERVIEW WITH DMITRY (THE AUTHOR OF TE AMO & GLADIATOR CHRONICLES),"**❗ ORIGINAL SOURCE: club\_50shades\_RC (TELEGRAM) ❗**

**❗ DATE PUBLISHED: AUGUST 26TH, 2025 ❗**

**❗ TRANSLATED FROM RUSSIAN TO ENGLISH USING GOOGLE AND YANDEX ❗** 

*There is magic in creating an entire universe out of an empty sheet and silence, filled with voices, destinies and choices that will excite thousands of players. This is the magic of the screenwriter… Get ready for a deep and sincere conversation. Welcome, reader! 3… 2… 1…*

**(1) Admin:** Dmitry, thank you very much for the conversation. We are truly glad to communicate with you! Let's start with the most intimate thing – from creative sources. Visual novels... They are often built on recognizable tropes and archetypes. But have there been completely unexpected sources of inspiration in your practice – maybe some scientific article, a painting, a forgotten music album – that literally turned your approach to work upside down?

**Dmitry (thoughtfully):** You know... I deliberately turned to tropes more in ""Gladiator Chronicles"" than in ""Te Amo"". After all, in GC we have a classic story about the formation of a hero, so there is a sage (Cassius), and a femme fatale (Augusta), and the loss of relatives, and the trope of ""from friends to lovers"", etc. **(with a slight smile)**. In ""Te Amo"" there are fewer of these ""designer"" elements, so I allowed myself a slightly more intuitive approach based on the experience gained. This does not mean that I prepared less for ""Te Amo"", no. From the very beginning, we determined how the story would begin, how it would develop and how it would end. But since the genre is different, the archetypes are more mixed, although, using Aunt Marguerite as an example, we see that the Sage has seeped into this story :)) **(pauses, collecting his thoughts)** In general, at first I was guided by books popular with beginning writers and screenwriters, such as ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", ""The Million Dollar Story"", ""Save the Cat"", as well as Robert Johnson's books – ""He"", ""She"". It was the latter that introduced me to the approach of Carl Gustav Jung.

**(2) Admin:** Oh, Jung – that's already serious depth! But tell me, based on this rich experience: what seemingly completely useless or even bad advice on writing turned out to be valuable to you? And vice versa, what common ""golden"" advice do you consider a dangerous myth?

**Dmitry:** Hmm... I don't remember any. Apparently, I had good teachers from the very beginning of my creative writing career. **(Suddenly perks up)** But off the top of my head, I'll say that advice related to inspiration most often turns out to be harmful. **(Confidently)** Discipline, that’s what decides. Especially if we play the long game and are focused on long-term development. Unfortunately, I can't yet call myself a very disciplined writer (or even a person, for that matter), but I'm working on it. It's hard, but one day the victory will be won!

**(3) Admin: (nods approvingly)** Discipline is, yes, a universal key to everything. But your stories, Dmitry, do not only touch on light topics. How do you manage to find that fragile balance between harsh truthfulness and the necessary artistic embellishment when it comes to complex, truly difficult psychological scenes?

**Dmitry:** This balance... It is a matter of taste, I think. In Chisinau, I was at four performances of a very famous Moldovan director who had great success with audiences in Romania and Russia. He has his own taste, his own style. It took me a long time to get used to it, but during each performance, after about forty minutes to an hour, I caught myself thinking: “Well, everything can’t be so bad for them (the characters) all the time.” I stopped believing what was happening on stage. **(Lowers his voice)** It’s scary, it just turns you off from what is happening. It's the same story with visual novels - you need to try not to ""overdo it"" so that the reader doesn't fly out of the story, no longer believing and feeling the characters. (With a kind smile) I have a bad habit of feeling sorry for my characters, but maybe it is this that allows me to somehow maintain this balance. But then again – all people are different. Some will have enough drama, some will not)

**(4) Admin (sympathetically):** You mentioned the characters... **(With a twinkle in their eyes)** Many authors love to hide personal Easter eggs and ciphers in their texts for the most devoted. Tell us today, do you have a special, very personal reference that you think only a few have noticed and deciphered?

**Dmitry (smiles relaxed):** For me, it's mostly related to the names of the characters. **(With a warm intonation)** There are characters in both GC and Te Amo that I've named after people I've talked to or still talk to.

**(5) Admin (softly):** This is very... It's touching. But creativity is also business, commerce. Has there ever been a time in your practice when you had to sacrifice your artistic vision for the sake of strict company requirements or the expectations of a mass audience? And how did you survive such an internal compromise?

**Dmitry (sighs, but without bitterness):** This happened even before I started working at YSI. I worked on a TV channel, where sometimes I had to filter some jokes and sketches very carefully (we had a comedy show), and sometimes turn a blind eye to the disadvantages of people whom the channel's management felt special sympathy for. It's important to understand that when you're an independent writer, you can do anything, because you have no obligations to anyone except yourself. But teamwork already presupposes certain limitations (because everyone is different) and new opportunities (because everyone knows how to do something different). It's all part of not only a writing career, but also just life. It is important to be able to be flexible – to give in sometimes, to stand your ground sometimes.

**(6) Admin:** Flexibility is really important. How do you feel about criticism in general? Is it a fuel for growth for you, or is it a poison that poisons the creative process? What is the most valuable feedback for you?

**Dmitry:** Listen... I've somehow learned to take criticism normally. Moreover, you can feel the weak points yourself, you know where you haven't finished, where there's not enough logic, etc. You agree with it and move on. Enthusiastic criticism is pleasant, devastating criticism brings you back down to earth, constructive criticism improves your skills, and unexpected interpretations often amuse you) **(Pause)** It hurts... Yes, I guess not anymore. **(With a slight grin)** I recently turned 31, so I've gained some armor :))

**(7) Admin (laughs):** Armor is a very useful acquisition! And has it ever happened that your characters began to live their own, unpredictable lives? Changed their character, fate, role in the plot? Or do you always strictly follow a pre-written plan?

**Dmitry (confidently):** In Te Amo, everything is according to plan. And the one-volume format does not allow for too much freedom. In GC, the characters went through a longer journey, therefore, they changed more, sometimes even in a direction that was unexpected for me. This is not better or worse than in Te Amo, it's just different. You must always answer the question: ""Will this make my story better? Will it add something significant? Will it become empty?""

**(8) Admin:** A very practical approach. (Changes the topic) Let's change the direction a little. Tell me, does working as a visual novel scriptwriter bring you any amazing bonuses in everyday life, besides, of course, financial rewards?

**Dmitry (sincerely):** One of the most pleasant bonuses is seeing the surprised faces of people playing Romance Club and whom I know personally, when they find out that I work there)

**(Enthusiastically)** It's no secret that in my free time I play in a private theater. Thanks to scriptwriting, I began to watch plays differently. **(With a slight note of dreaminess)** I'm also thinking about a production where I would act as a director, but I haven't decided yet – it takes a lot of time, and this resource is difficult at the moment.

**(9) Admin:** The theater is wonderful! **(Thoughtfully)** Speaking of personal stuff... Is this unusual ""Memorable Attic"" in Te Amo pure fiction, or is it still a piece of someone's real experience, maybe even your own, woven into it? How autobiographical is this story overall?

**Dmitry (speaking slowly, as if to himself):** The attic... is a metaphor in some sense. A place inside yourself where you rarely go and try to get out as quickly as possible, because it's dark, scary, maybe there's a bogeyman hiding behind the closet. **(The tone becomes warmer)** And then you come there with some person, he helps you clean up, hangs up a garland. And now it's not so scary. **(With slight sadness)** And you'll definitely find albums with memories there. Because of which, perhaps, you once abandoned this attic.

**(10) Admin (after a short pause, more quietly):** This is a very... deep and poignant metaphor. Thank you for sharing this. **(Returns to a businesslike tone)** Now let's talk about the technical side of the process. How does the player choice mechanic affect the architecture of the plot? Do you first build a steel core and then build up the branches, or is variability the foundation from day one?

**Dmitry (collecting his thoughts):** Depends on the story, I think. Te Amo is quite intimate, where the main concept is hidden in the narrative itself. I hope that after the finale, our ideas will become clear to everyone. The plot branches are not too significant, because you need to maintain a balance between the part that everyone will see (general content), and the part that will be visible only from one of the paths. I am afraid to make too strong plot branches, since our timing is not infinite.

**(11) Admin:** I see. And how is the process of your collaboration with artists and composers structured? How meticulously do you write visual cues into the script – facial expressions, poses, background changes – so that they carry an independent narrative load?

**Dmitry (getting animated):** I am always for co-creation! Technical assignments may include mandatory elements. For example, there must be a sea / one or another vase / painting on the backdrop, or fast jazz must be playing. This means that the artist must draw the sea, the vase, the painting – in all other respects, they are free to add (after approval) any elements that seem interesting or suitable to him. I also try to give the characters the necessary emotions so that they correspond to the context. It's a kind of directing, this narrative design of yours)

**(12) Admin (laughs):** Directing – that’s for sure! (More seriously) How do you fight off accusations of too much ""water"" in the text? How do you manage to maintain a dynamic rhythm so that a modern, pampered player doesn't get bored?

**Dmitry (confidently):** It all depends on the tempo of the narrative. A calm 200-line dialogue in the kitchen is better diluted with a lot of choices, since the location does not change, the characters do not argue, do not conflict. Flashbacks are also perfectly embedded here. The characters of the same Te Amo could describe in words what their mistakes of the past and their pain are. But we made flashbacks out of it, showing the player through other locations and characters what was happening there. **(Emphasises)** Cut out the flashbacks from this section, and it won't be as dynamic.

**(13) Admin:** This is a very smart and clear move! (With admiration) And it is thanks to such decisions that your novellas have such powerful, truly emotional climax scenes. But how do you create them when players come to them in completely different ways and with different knowledge about the world?

**Dmitry (smiles gratefully):** Thank you for the compliment 😊! It's all because of the mix of common scenes, the general tone of the narrative, the attempt to see the picture in front of you from different points of view. (Seriously) You also can't offend players who don't take premium content - they should also be interested (although with premium content, of course, it's more interesting). Well, you don't feel sorry for your characters, otherwise who will the player empathize with? And it would be good to do everything so that the player is imbued with this or that hero.

**(14) Admin:** Empathy - yes, that's the key word. How deeply do you describe the inner world, the reflections of the main character, considering that players often project themselves onto them and make choices based on purely personal experience? How to avoid destructive dissonance?

**Dmitry (philosophically):** RC has a very large audience, each person is different. Someone has one experience, someone else another... You can't reach everyone. You just need to recognize this, accept it and work on, relying on what may be familiar to a large number of people you want to reach. **(Enthusiastically)** Stats also help the hero and the player to become somewhat “akin” - some try to solve their problems as they arise, some wait until they are ready to solve them, some put them off for a long time or allow difficulties to resolve themselves (stats ""Achiever"" and ""Observer"" from Te Amo).

**(15) Admin:** Stats are still an ingenious solution for interactivity. Can you briefly describe how a raw idea turns into an interactive story format? What are the most difficult ideas to come up with when adapting to non-linearity?

**Dmitry (thinks for a second):** I can't remember such ideas... When you write a story, you already know that it should be nonlinear, so everything adapts to this automatically.

**(16) Admin (smiling):** And what is your favorite and driving stage of story development? And which one, perhaps, causes a mild groan?..

**Dmitry (thoughtfully):** There are pros and cons at all stages of development... I won't name an unloved one, but my favorite is not so much the stage as the moment when you understand that you have found the key to all the characters – you feel them, you know how each of them speaks and how they react.

**(17) Admin (with understanding):** It must be a magical feeling – like you're connecting to a collective mind. And the last general question: how do you personally feel about the system of hidden stats that quietly influence the ending? Will we see more sophisticated mechanics in your future works?

**Dmitry (enthusiastically):** Such stats are in Te Amo, by the way! I feel great about it, it's just important not to overdo it with them.

**(18) Admin (happily):** Great! But we still have many questions from your devoted fans and subscribers! Shall we continue? The main character of Te Amo is a writer. Tell me, will we ever be able to get acquainted with at least a small fragment of her book?

**Dmitry:** Of course 😉

**(19) Admin:** Will players be able to briefly play the role of Roza Syabitova and bring together characters? For example, Thomas and Jeanne? I really want to try!

**Dmitry (with slight doubt):** I can't really imagine such a mechanic in a single-volume edition. If there was more time, then yes. The question is what – there are only ten chapters. Three or four are spent just on getting to know the favorites, not to mention any certainty. And for the ""mixing"" to be organic, it needs to be given after the branches are closed, so that conflicts do not arise. And in Te Amo, our closing happens at the very last moment, so there is not much time for ""Roza Syabitova"".

**(20) Admin:** How did you choose the names and surnames for the characters? Was it a long process or an epiphany?

**Dmitry:** According to the euphony and, to some extent, the geographical principle. Michael is a classic English and American name, Jeanne is French and Creole, Thomas is Tomasso– Italian, etc.

**(21) Admin:** ""Te Amo: The Bay of Hope"" ... Was that the original title, or were there other, maybe even crazy options in the process?

**Dmitry (with a warm note in his voice):** ""Bay of Hope"" was the original. I really liked this name. So warm) And then the name of the anthology was added – Te Amo.

**(22) Admin:** More than a year has passed since the finale of ""Gladiator Chronicles"". How do you now, with a fresh look, evaluate your first big work? Would you like to radically fix or rewrite something?

**Dmitry (with a chuckle):** You know, I (and other scriptwriters I asked) have a funny thing – a chapter disappears from my memory almost immediately after writing the last word. I remember the sequence of events in GC in general terms, but I'm sure that if I reread it from the first chapter, I would have found something to complain about.

**(23) Admin:** What do you think about the innovation in ""Code Blue"" – the gender selection function for the main character? Are you glad that players once again have the opportunity to play the story from the perspective of a male character?

**Dmitry (sincerely happy):** Great! Innovations are cool. The more options players have, the better. I wish Yim great luck and success)

**(24) Admin:** The situation with Li and Nick seemed very complicated and ambiguous to many. Why didn't anyone around her, including the MC, try to push Li, or rather dissuade her from such a hasty and emotional decision – adoption? It would be so unconventional for the RC universe! Have you considered such a turn of events?

**Dmitry (calmly and judiciously):** Nick and Li need a third person who could show them the situation from the outside. They've both been through a lot of stress, and so they're both under the influence of emotions, so Jane's words can be the catalyst that will allow them to restore their faith not so much in each other, but in themselves. **(Short pause)** Besides, Li herself is wondering if she's doing the right thing. Her obsession with this idea is growing into something more meaningful, maybe even frightening – after all, such a responsibility…

**(25) Admin:** Which of your stories' settings do you personally like more – GC or Te Amo? They're radically different!

**Dmitry (admits):** Not only the settings are different, but also the genres. It's easier to love GC – there's an author's world, action, adventure - this always evokes more emotions than a quietly told story about the problems that ordinary people face... But Te Amo is probably closer now.

**(26) Admin:** Why is the setting of Te Amo associated with the sea, relaxation, and a calm atmosphere? Did you consciously want to ""dilute"" the current line of dynamic stories with something more measured and intimate?

**Dmitry (with obvious pleasure):** I read the comments and am glad that ""The Bay"" turned out exactly like this – romantic, a little melancholic, despite the sun, sea and beach, warm. Its leisurely pace really seemed to play into our hands - ""The Bay of Hope"" is read to relax, to smile somewhere, to cry somewhere.

**(27) Admin:** The first volume of the story is almost finished. Are there plans to introduce achievements and achievements for it?

**Dmitry:** Yes, I am working on them at the moment of giving this interview)

**(28) Admin:** Will there be a second volume of Te Amo? And if so, will you be its author or will you pass on the baton?

**Dmitry (restrainedly):** I can't answer this question yet.

**(29) Admin:** Do you often make weird or funny ""margin notes"" while working? If so, what was the most recent one?

**Dmitry (laughs):** That you need to do push-ups more often)

⭐

**Admin:** Dmitry, now get ready for our traditional, lightning-fast blitz survey! Answer quickly, the first thing that comes to mind. Let's go!

***Paper/pen or keyboard?***

**Dmitry:** Typewriter! **(Laughs)** But if you have to choose from the options, then paper and pen)

***A bustling metropolis or a quiet countryside?***

**Dmitry:** A quiet countryside, preferably near the mountains and the sea. **(With humor)** The lip-rolling machine has already left :D

***Day or night? When are the best ideas born?***

**Dmitry:** At night. Or late in the evening.

***Tea, coffee or...?***

**Dmitry:** Coffee, but less of it. Cocoa top. Oh, a protein shake with milk!

***The main enemy of creativity?***

**Dmitry:** Fear. And not only creativity.

***Rix or Jane?***

**Dmitry (thinking for a second):** I've gotten older, so Jane. **(With a grin)** But if I were 18, definitely Rix!

***Protagonist or antagonist? Who is more interesting to write about?***

**Dmitry:** It's easier to write a character that you can better imagine, that resonates more strongly, that is clear to you - his goals, his methods.

***You need to fit the climax into the last 20 slides. An intimate scene or a powerful plot point?***

**Dmitry:** Intimacy. Slow, final. **(With irony and a smile)** Although you were stingy, of course) 20 slides are not enough for both an intimate scene and an action scene.

***What annoys you most in books/movies/TV series?***

**Dmitry:** Illogicality.

***What is the strangest or most ridiculous search query in your entire time working?***

**Dmitry:** Heating system in houses in New Orleans :)))

***Three words describing the finale of the Bay of Hope.***

**Dmitry:** Cry, smile, hope.

⭐

**Admin:** Dmitry, it was incredibly sincere, deep and sometimes very funny! Thank you so much for this interview, for your openness and, of course, for your creativity. We are all waiting with bated breath for the finale of the Bay of Hope!

The good--

\-Nobody cares. Literally nobody. Yes, people do a little double-take the first time you see them, but that's it. My close friends and even my mom have all seen me and none of them have asked. After 8 weeks, I can count four people who have asked me about it-- one nosy coworker, two people who are considering it and wanted to pick my brain, and one date. 

\-Yes, I'm actively dating with Invisalign, and guess what? Nobody cares. It's visible in all the pics on my dating profile. I do zero disclosure before a first date because I think that would make me seem self-conscious, and I'm not self-conscious! To my surprise, two of the girls I saw could relate, saying they had done Invisalign in the last few years for a minor correction themselves.

\-I eat healthier, more nutritious meals to prevent myself from getting hungry. I don't want to mess with  the aligners during my busy work day. 

\-The results! I can see the difference! Peeking ahead at the last tray in the set is exciting. 

  
The bad--

\-The surprise of seeing the treatment plan in detail on the first day. I thought my correction was minor and my orthodontist agreed at the consultation. I knew the attachments were highly variable, but I figured minor correction, minor attachments, right? Not even close. Installation day included attachments on 25 teeth. Only the molars are spared. All of them are big, blocky, and in different directions, which increases their visibility. And there are hooks for rubber bands that I wear for the entire treatment plan. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I saw myself in the mirror, because it isn't \*that\* bad, but I was seriously nervous until I saw it for myself.

\-Comparing myself to others. Basically everyone I see with Invisalign has a lower attachment burden than me, and that is a bummer. 

  
\-The tooth sensitivity during the first two weeks. Everyone warns you about the pain. I say, bring it on. I don't care about the soreness/pain at all. But that electric tooth sensitivity? Holy smokes. I brushed my teeth so gingerly during those first weeks. Thankfully, like everyone says, it gets better. 

\-Concern about staining attachments/aligners or damaging my teeth. I have never eaten/tasted/snacked on any food with the aligners. I've had some nights where I'm out at bars for several hours, and I've settled on light beer only with lots of water swishing. I have basically given up coffee because I won't drink it with the aligners in. I will go the entire course without drinking red wine.

\-Brushing my teeth in public bathrooms. This is especially bad in crowded restaurants/bars, when I occupy a sink and a line forms. You can't help but feel a bit silly. 

\-Carrying Invisalign stuff with you. Even the slim case I found is still too big to comfortably keep in my pocket when seated, so it ends up on the table with my phone. It's a bit finicky. ",2,1756223220.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False

""The Intelligent Player: A Coach's Comprehensive Guide to Defining, Teaching, and Mastering Soccer IQ,"" by Etienne Noumen, **explores the concept of Soccer IQ** as a crucial element distinguishing elite players. It **breaks down game intelligence into five core pillars**: tactical awareness, game vision, decision-making, anticipation, and positional understanding, arguing that **cognitive ability often surpasses raw athleticism**.

The guide then **introduces the ""Dan Blank Method,""** emphasising the importance of speed of play and offering **practical habits for intelligent players**, such as the ""one-touch mindset"" and ""3-step rule"" for off-the-ball movement. Furthermore, it **provides coaches with a toolkit**including small-sided games, Socratic questioning, and video analysis, alongside **a progressive drill library** to implement these principles, culminating in a **tactical intervention plan for common youth soccer challenges**.

# Part I: The Architecture of the 'Soccer Brain'

The modern game of soccer is played at a blistering pace, a fluid and chaotic environment where technical proficiency and physical prowess are merely the price of admission. The quality that separates the good from the great, and the great from the elite, is a less tangible but far more decisive attribute: Soccer Intelligence, or Soccer IQ. This cognitive capacity is the central processing unit of the elite player, the software that runs the hardware of their physical gifts. For coaches, particularly at the developmental levels, understanding and cultivating this intelligence is the most profound and impactful contribution they can make to a player's long-term success. This report provides a comprehensive blueprint for coaches to move beyond the buzzword and into the practical, on-field application of teaching Soccer IQ. It deconstructs the concept into its core components, presents a proven methodological framework based on the work of Dan Blank, and offers a progressive library of drills designed to forge smarter, more effective players.

1n0pdif,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n0pdif/why_bonavita_bv1901ts_coffee_maker_review_stands/,Why Bonavita BV1901TS Coffee Maker Review Stands Out for Perfect Home Brewing?,"**Bonavita BV1901TS Coffee Maker: An Honest Review**

Testing out the Bonavita BV1901TS Coffee Maker over the past few weeks has been quite an experience, to say the least. As someone who drinks coffee religiously and enjoys experimenting with brewing methods, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to try this SCA-certified machine. It claims to deliver a perfect 8-cup carafe with just one touch, so I had to see if it really lives up to the hype—or if it’s just another coffee maker trying to dazzle us with fancy advertising.

**Design and Build Quality**

The moment I unboxed this coffee machine, the modern stainless-steel finish immediately grabbed my attention. It’s sleek and compact, not taking up much space on my kitchen counter, which is a bonus for those of us with limited kitchen real estate. Its dimensions—16.5""D x 8.1""W x 14.6""H—make it fairly manageable. The included components, such as the 1.3L stainless steel double-wall thermal carafe, brewer, filter basket, and even descaling powder, show that they’ve thought of convenience. However, I did notice that at 6.13 pounds, it feels lighter than I expected for something in its price range, leaving me wondering about its long-term durability.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**

This coffee maker boasts a 1500-watt heater capable of bringing water to the optimal brewing temperature of 194°F–205°F consistently, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it brews a full 8-cup carafe in six minutes flat. I found the one-touch brewing process super simple, especially during those groggy mornings when you’re barely awake. The brewing completion alert is a small but helpful touch, though it’s loud enough to scare my cat every time (so, maybe keep your pets out of the kitchen).

**[Check Bonavita BV1901TS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b076pfmrgx/)**

The bloom feature—an optional pre-infusion mode—was a game-changer for me. It pre-wets the coffee grounds before brewing, something only more advanced brewers offer, resulting in a richer and more aromatic cup. The flat-bottom filter basket and showerhead work hand-in-hand to ensure even water distribution, which definitely enhanced my coffee's flavor profile. That being said, I will admit that this brewer favors medium-coarse coffee grounds. Whenever I used finer grounds, I noticed some minor clogging in the filter basket.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Cleaning is one of those chores we all dread, but this machine makes it bearable. The filter basket, showerhead, and carafe lid are all dishwasher-safe, which is probably my favorite feature for everyday use. I hate scrubbing coffee residue out of awkward components, so this was a relief. Plus, the BPA-free parts gave me a little extra peace of mind when using it. However, the stainless steel carafe, though great at retaining heat, can sometimes be tricky to clean thoroughly by hand without a proper bottle brush.

**Key Benefits**

- Effortless one-touch brewing process.
- Consistent heating between 194°F–205°F ensures quality extraction.
- Optional pre-infusion mode enhances coffee flavors significantly.
- Compact design fits small kitchen spaces.
- Dishwasher-safe and BPA-free components for easy cleaning.

**Caveats**

- Lighter build raises questions about long-term durability.
- Finer coffee grounds can lead to minor clogs during brewing.
- Louder brewing alert might not be suitable for early mornings or quiet households.  
- Carafe can be slightly inconvenient to clean manually without proper tools.

**Competing Products**

A machine like this inevitably draws comparisons to other top-tier brands like Technivorm’s Moccamaster and Breville’s Precision Brewer. Technivorm’s Moccamaster excels in build quality with its handcrafted European design, but it comes at a significantly higher price. Breville’s Precision Brewer, on the other hand, offers more brewing customization options than the Bonavita BV1901TS but lacks the simplicity of its one-touch operation. Where Bonavita stands out is its balance of cost-effectiveness and ease of use, especially for those who prioritize a quick, consistent, and straightforward cup without fiddling with complicated settings. However, if design aesthetics or ultra-fine brewing controls hold importance, other options may seem more appealing.

**Affordable Quality**

In all my time experimenting with coffee machines, striking the right balance between quality and affordability has been a challenge. This brewer, for its price, does a decent job of offering a premium experience without punching a hole in your wallet. It might not outshine every competitor in bells and whistles, but it delivers where it counts—your morning coffee. Considering its inclusion of useful features like pre-infusion, dishwasher-safe components, and compact size, it’s worth checking out, especially if you’re not looking to splurge on higher-end models.

Coming to Armenia for the football match in a few weeks and after doing research, still have a few questions: 

is the N100 night bus mentioned here still active? https://www.zvartnots.aero/EN/Content/Transport I can only it online and at that link. Is it easy to spot the bus stop at the airport for the nightbus? Reading out the ""taxi driver"" situation, I'd like to know in advance where to go when exiting the terminal. Finally, from looking at Yandex, the stop to go towards the airport seems to be also on France Square. I guess you buy ticket from the Telcell terminal there? Does the bus driver also take cash? Do the Telcell terminals take cash as well or just card? 

Booking GG at the airport, if you book GG at the airport say arrivals, where does the car wait? Again want to avoid issues outside the building with w@nker taxi drivers.. I assume itÄs enough to book GG over the app on airport Wifi (I read it can be spotty) and then walking out to wherever a few minutes later, or driver might call. Only there for a few days and no need for a Armenian sim.

What's the Wifi situation like in restaurants / bars at night? Ok to book GG to the airport if needs be? 

We're arriving fairly early morning, probably getting into town around 6am-ish Sunday morning. Are there any recommended places in the city centre of Yerevan to have breakfast or coffee to kill some time? Or is everything shut at that time? Don't need anything fancy, anywhere locals go is fine as well. 

Likewise, what's the late night situation like for killing some time before going to airport around 1am? Are restaurants open late into the night (as in Spain for example) or we are stuck with bars after a certain time?

SAS supermarkets are the best place to change cash from what I read. Are they really open 24 hours?

The fact is that on many occasions, such as when inserting the milk jug or removing it, the machine tells me to empty the coffee grounds drawer. Until I take out and put the drawer back in, the machine doesn't work. 

Speaking with customer service, they have given me 2 possible solutions. Return the machine (I have 30 days) and buy a new one or have them send me another box of coffee grounds. 

It seems that this drawer has a tab on the right side that makes contact with the sensor that is responsible for indicating whether the drawer is full or open. 

For now I have asked for the box to be sent to me and I will continue testing. 

If I am careful and hold the drawer when putting the milk jug in and out, the warning does not appear, but as soon as I am careless and the jug touches the lower rack, the warning appears.

1n0p777,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoFishing/comments/1n0p777/fishing_with_kids_and_what_ive_learned_along_the/,Fishing with Kids and What I've Learned Along the Way,"I've been trying to publish this with some fishing blogs, but I haven't gotten a response to my inquiries so I wanted to share what I wrote here. I would love any feedback! 

I recently returned from a camping trip with my family and have been thinking about how much fun I have fishing with my kids. Recently, I've found that my kids are excited to go and typically, we experience few, if any, problems while we're out. At most, I might have some complaints that they're hungry or thirsty or even the occasional request to go home, but for the most part, it's been smooth sailing. It hasn't always been this way, though. There have been a handful of times that I've lost my temper, become frustrated, yelled, or just plain wanted to pack up and head home because it became unenjoyable or I became too focused on the fact that I wasn't getting to fish. I was upset that I was out with the kids while my wife got a break at home (albeit a well-deserved break). Over time, and with a lot of work, I've been able to change my mindset to one that's more conducive to fishing with my kids, one that I hope will instill a love of fishing in them rather than stain it with memories associating it with frustration and anger, an outcome I've heard all to often from my friends who I've invited along on trips.

One story stands out the most. I was spending time with a friend and invited him along to fish. He tells me that he hates fishing because he doesn't feel that he can be quiet long enough. When I asked him what he meant, he said that his only memory of fishing was his grandfather yelling at him to be quiet or he'd scare the fish away. There was no recollection of fishing being a good time, just being yelled at for doing something all kids excel at doing: making noise! I'm certainly not innocent in this. I’ve had my share of frustrations—like untangling fishing line for the 50th time or hearing my four-year-old’s ‘unreasonable’ requests that, in hindsight, were perfectly reasonable for a kid. Most vividly, I recall a few incidents early in the fishing season where it's very cold in the morning and trying to get one of my kids to understand that if he gets his jacket wet, he's not going to have a good time. Naturally, he dives into the bucket we have filled with water so he can watch the fish for a bit before releasing and gets his sleeves soaked! One time he went through two jackets! But again, this is normal for kids. It's not easy to get over, and I'm not claiming to be perfect, but I'm hoping to share some of the insights I've gained along the way and how I accepted these normal behaviors as exactly what kids are supposed to do. 
 
When someone becomes a dad, one of the first things you often hear is a dad planning all the awesome things they hope to do with their kids whether that be to share their favorite sport, to take them hunting, to teach them about their passion, and so many other things. It's an awesome time to plan and hope for all of the great experiences that lay ahead and the relationship that we'll get to build along the way. But no one ever preps to handle the speed bumps along the way. Sometimes we've had great parents that give us a role model to embody when things get rough, but some of us don’t have that luxury. We never learned how to manage frustration, at least not in a healthy way or in a way that maintains a relationship. And without some serious work, we often stay stuck and are at risk of passing off our own poor coping skills to our kids, the same kids who we had so much hope for and who we hoped to be great models for. So how do we get past our frustrations to teach them these life lessons on the water? To teach them how to handle frustrations when the big one gets away or we lose our favorite lure? Or how to deal with it when we get tangled in that dang tree again!?
 
The biggest shift for me was a switch in my mindset: I'm not fishing with my kids because I like to go fishing and want to catch fish; I'm fishing with my kids to introduce them to the sport and foster an enjoyment of fishing and the outdoors in them.
 
Sure it's great catching fish. I still struggle to this day with some pangs of jealousy when my kiddo is catching fish--even the bluegill sometimes--and I can't seem to land a dang thing. The little booger will even comment sometimes, ""Dad! I'm catching so many and you haven't caught one yet!"" Thankfully, he softens the blow by saying, ""If you want to catch some bluegill, come over by me."" I appreciate the connection he's looking for with the last comment, though. My point being, if you can foster an intrinsic enjoyment of fishing in your kids, they'll ask to come along with you instead of asking to stay home or do something else. I can still remember the first time my oldest asked me to go fishing. I was so excited to hear that he wanted to come along. My little one tends to be a homebody and will often ask to go home, but if she sticks it out, she loves seeing the fish, the wildlife, birds, and everything else around her. I'll often find her playing in the dirt, looking for bugs, or following her big brother around to see if he will catch a fish for her. She's also a great helper when I'm struggling to reel in a big fish and she comes over to help me reel it in!

Often, an intent behind taking kids fishing extends beyond sharing a passion with them; it's about teaching life lessons. While so many lessons can be taught on the water, I most often hear a desire to teach patience, an appreciation for nature, distress and frustration tolerance, and tenacity. Patience is key with fishing and one that can be difficult to manage with small children as they by nature can struggle with this. Sure, we all have experienced the days we can't keep a hook wet because we dialed in on what the fish are biting--thankfully, my kids and I recently got to experience this on a trip where we brought in 47 fish in five hours!-- but we've all experienced the slow days, the days we're likely to get skunked or the days we ultimately walk away empty handed. As an adult, we can often see the brighter side of things: you got a day outside doing something you love or you got a chance to get away from everything and connect with nature. For a kid, it's often catching fish that they're most looking forward to and managing that disappointment can be hard! 

There's a few ways I manage this. First and foremost, I focus on connection and sharing how I'm frustrated too. I say something like, ""I'm sad we didn't catch anything too, but I'm glad I got to spend this time with you guys. You're fun to spend time with."" I'll also add something to highlight what we did, ""what about that awesome animal you saw!"" (One time we saw a wild mink, a rare occurrence around here) or some of the exciting bugs they saw while we were out and about. Finally, I keep it simple; I'll do the tried and true techniques most often with stocked trout so we rarely walk away empty handed. Sure, it's not as exciting as chasing our dream species, honing our skills, going to destination or remote lakes, or learning new techniques, but I've found that catching something can keep that excitement alive. We're also often stuck at local ponds or easily accessible places which comes with its own challenges of overly pressured fish or too many people. Thankfully, here in Colorado, we have an amazing state park system with opportunities in many places to catch fish. 

Even with all of that, you can still teach those hoped for life lessons along the way. Patience is just part of fishing and waiting for that bobber to drop or that bell to ding is just part of it. Over time, my kids have been able to entertain themselves by looking for bugs, playing a game together, looking for crawdads, or any number of activities near the fishing area. Building this patience took time. I'll be honest, I let my kids watch tablets from time to time, but outside of some early trips it's been a hard no for the tablets or other screens to come along. Early on, this tested my patience because now I needed to be the source of entertainment, but with consistency they were able to entertain themselves. It took quite a few trips of me baiting up my poles with some worms and Powerbait instead of fishing all the ways I wanted to get there, though. I had to show patience to teach patience. 

Another important lesson I touched on earlier was frustration tolerance. There are so many frustrating aspect of fishing for a young kid from learning how to cast, to tying knots, to the occasional hook, to almost hooking your parents and getting yelled at, to putting bait on a hook and so on. As an adult, I think it's easy to forget that we had to learn these skills too. I often have to manage my own frustration in these situations to be a good model though I'm certainly not perfect here. I try to remember that coordination is still being developed and that the fine motor skills needed to hook a worm or salmon egg are still developing. We've also casted thousands of times so we have the muscle memory of when to release the button or let go of the line and how to properly load a pole to get the farthest distance or get close to where we want to go. Kids are just learning these skills! They're building that muscle memory we take for granted! I've found that giving gentle reminders about technique and pointing out when they've done well can pay dividends. We've also spent a handful of days at a local park with a big field casting our poles together! I get a chance to figure out my dang baitcaster and my kid gets to practice casting. I'm still using my spinning reel anytime we go out, but my kid is casting farther than ever! You win some and you lose some…

Lastly, some survival tips: bring snacks, an extra set of clothes, prepare for the sun, and be safe. While I certainly struggle with getting hangry, I can often make it most of the day with an average breakfast and some coffee. Your kids can't. A hangry toddler or small child is a different beast entirely that should only be approached with the utmost caution and care (and snacks, preferably).  All jokes aside, this is no fun for any party involved. By including snacks, lunch, and more water in my trips, I've been able to extend our fishing trips by multiple hours. Yes, it increases the amount you have to carry since it's unlikely a small child could carry much; but with a wagon, it's been easy! The extra clothes should be self-explanatory. There have been a handful of trips my kids have gotten muddy, gotten fish blood on them, fallen in the water (bring a lifejacket if they can't swim, even if you're shore fishing), or simply wanted to jump in the shallow part of the lake. I can rest easy knowing they'll be warm and dry in the car when we leave by having some extra clothes in the car. If it's cold, I've also had them dress in layers occasionally even having them layer up in long underwear on a few situations. It's easier to take off a layer than warm up. Just make sure you're mindful of how hot it is outside with the extra layers, especially on those cold mornings that heat up quickly! My last two points above are somewhat tied together. Sunburns are painful and dangerous over long periods of time. I've invested in sun shirts, breathable pants, and sun hats for myself and my kids and I gotta say, it's been a game changer. I'm no longer dealing with as much sunscreen as I was before and we're still cool on the hottest days. We also need to be mindful of the gear we bring along. I use hooks renowned for their sharpness and while I know how to get a barbed hook out of myself, dealing with a hooked kid is no fun for anyone. Teach awareness and mindfulness here as to what's around, who is where, and where things are going when I cast to help here.

Well, I spent quite a bit more time explaining my points above, but I wanted to go a bit more in depth to my points than what I've found in other articles while sharing my own struggles along the way. I've been fishing with my kids for three years now and while I've certainly grown a lot myself, I still struggle remembering the above points from time to time, especially in the heat of the moment. We're all going to mess up from time to time, but acknowledging and owning our mistakes, apologizing, repairing, and actually doing better next time can go a long way. Getting my kids outside regularly and fostering something in them that I enjoy has been a wonderful experience for me. We've shared so many awesome memories and have had the opportunity to explore so many awesome places around our beautiful state that I wouldn't trade it for anything. I've grown into a better person, and I hope a better dad, and my kids have grown exponentially in all of the aspects I've mentioned above. I hope some day that they'll have their own lessons on the water that they can pass on to others.

1n0p71a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n0p71a/awkward_ghosting_after_the_first_date/,Awkward Ghosting after the first Date.,"So basically I asked this girl out and she was very happy to get coffee sometime. 
I asked if she wanted to get coffee on the weekend when I got her number and asked her she didn’t respond for a week. Then came back and apologized for not responding and we went on a Date on the next Weekend. 
On the date we had great chemistry and it was super fun. She said that she never laughed this much before and this was one of the best dates she ever had. While we were on the date we talked about a lot of topics and we always laughed and had fun while doing so. One of the topics was „relationship issues“ and I said that I have attachment issues due to childhood and past relationships. Which basically means I love a lot but I’m scared to take a step because that makes vulnerable in the future. 
She said something similar. She said that she doesn’t really respond to texts and is sometimes taking a step back to think logically about situations so that doesn’t mean she’s not interested but she’s also somehow scared to do something wrong. 
Either way the date was great and we constantly talked for 11 hours straight. When I brought her home she was standing there for a couple of minutes obviously waiting for me to kiss her. But I couldn’t. I told her I really can’t and that I really really enjoyed it but I’m to scared to take a step. 
She was very understanding the whole time even after she was waiting and said that the date was super fun and that we can take things slow. When I got home she told me to call her and we talked about it briefly and she comforted me by saying it’s very okay and there’s no need to worry. And that it was fun either way. 
We are both 24 years old. 

Now a week has passed and we texted a couple of times on the first 2 days after the date and then she stopped responding for the rest. 
My question is: 
Has anybody experienced something similar and how do I proceed ? 
Could it be that she just needs time as she stated or did I f- up too bad ?",1,1756222643.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I decided to book a hotel outside of Boston (about 40 minutes) because I will have my car and I honestly really like driving through new areas. I wanted to also stay out of the busy areas for sleeping at night. I’ll probably only spend my time at the hotel sleeping. 

Anyway, I am going for the weekend, will be arriving around 11a-12p. I planned bringing some extra clothes to change into once I’m there and exploring Boston during that day before heading to my hotel at night to check in. 

The next morning, I plan to wake up early and head to Salem for the day. I am going very early October - and I’ve read that it’s honestly crazy during *all* of October which I do not mind at all and am fully anticipating - I’m just extremely excited to explore the town and just walk around. I’ll definitely plan a nicer sit down dinner for that night and probably the night before in Boston too, unless anybody has other recommendations. 

If I’m overwhelmed by mid afternoon in Salem I may head over to Manchester by the Sea or another beach (please recommend) - will they be open for people to go on? 

I planned on my last day, after check out, exploring different beaches along the coast, or going back to Boston/Salem, whichever I like more. But honestly, I am extremely open to mixing up this itinerary - this is my first solo trip and first time in Boston - so I am going in sort of blind. 

So, I’m looking for any and all recommendations. Like I said - I have my car, & I don’t mind making a drive (clearly lol). I really like history - so I am already looking into some walk through tours. I love smaller coffee shops/pastry shops, and mom/pop shops. I like to walk lol. I love food and drink - and I like going out to a restaurant alone so that’s not an issue.

I seem to have surrounded myself with people who would classify as ""capitalism's wet dream"". They're hardworking high achievers who work 6 days a week, barely eat and spend the little freetime they have isolating themselves. 

See, i live in a european country with a culture which generally speaking value life/work balance, and although i am aware there are people who don't have the luxury to take a day off, I can with confidence say that these people are not even trying to take care of themselves, not even on their one day off. 

I know this because one of them is my mother, and the other is a lifelong friend. I've brought my mother tea in the evening for years, and ive listened to how she can't deal with anything anymore. It doesnt matter that her health is declining, and she's getting weaker. She will still down prioritize her health and take on extra shifts. She still refuses to take her medication, and she still complain about me pushing it onto her and ""trying to raise her"". 

I had to drag myself out of my own mental health, which took a lot of energy and time. I now try to prioritize working out, eating better and getting enough sleep. My schedule is busy, but i still manage to take these things seriously, maybe not perfectly everyday, but i try to, and it works. I'm feeling much better.

However, Ive noticed how im getting less empathetic over time, and that's the main reason im writing this post. I'm getting tired of seeing the same people go in the same pattern,  and im tired of being compassionate, understanding, supportive and patient. It just annoys me at this point. They also get annoyed at me, saying im ""trying to lecture them"", and maybe im pushing it too hard, but their pain affect me and i obviously want to help. 

 It feels like they're fishing for empathy, not even trying to work through their own issues. There's no wonder you can't sleep, your depression and anxiety is back again, and your back hurts, if you work 9 hours everyday 6 times a week, survive on coffee, and never talk to anybody. I'm sorry, I just CAN\*T sit here and feel sorry for them, does that make me a bad person?

On the day of check-in she asked to check-in early but we told her cleaning wouldn’t be done yet to which she replied no rush at all and to take our time. When she checked in she sent a very friendly message saying how much she loved the place and thanking me for everything.

We started noticing strange behaviour on our outdoor cameras later that night. She started bringing in a ton of personal belongings and seemed agitated and was slamming her things down on the porch. She sent an overly excited message to me asking if I wanted to join her on a yacht with her friend shortly. The closest body of water to the Airbnb is very far away and I politely said I wasn’t available and asked what lake she was headed to. She never replied (and it didn’t look like she even read the message). She left in her car at around 9pm and got back around 530am. All seemed normal until later that 2nd night when she oddly rearranged our patio furniture and strategically placed our watering can directly in the middle of our back porch. She continued to bring a ton of her stuff in and out of the house and then left around 9pm that night and didn’t come back (she was supposed to be there for 3 more nights). We could see she left our bathroom items (towel basket) and trash on the front porch all night and we could see the windows were cranked wide open. We decided to drive by the house to make sure everything looked okay. When we drove by we saw sheets covering windows that didn’t have blinds, the screen door of our top balcony wide open and garbage everywhere. We pulled in and messaged her asking if she was home and said we had concerns. We then went to the door and looked in the window and saw the start of the destruction: Art torn off the walls, substances all over the floors and walls, her stuff and garbage absolutely everywhere. We tried calling her and she didn’t answer. We called Airbnb support immediately and after a frustrating conversation they canceled her reservation and told us we needed to let her check out but said they would “support us calling local authorities”. We called the police and had them escort us into the home because we were terrified of what else we would encounter. 

Our entire home was vandalized in the most unsettling ways: 
- garbage literally everywhere
- substances (blue, brown & white liquids) smeared all over walls, floors, ceilings & furniture
- Food (cereal, pop tarts, chips, cheetos, coffee grinds), pills, white powder & wet dog food thrown on literally all floors, rugs & furniture
- Both toilets filled with feces, toilet paper, garbage, plants, beer cans
- Bathtub filled with water and then 3 pillows, plants, linens, garbage, a remote thrown in
- Feces in the shower
- Samsung Frame tv pulled half off wall and cables ripped out and cut
- multiple items stolen (inc. all remotes for tvs, fireplace, garage, fans)
- All linens, towels, pillows stained/ruined
- Lightbulbs gone, outdoor string lights torn down/ruined
- Chopsticks stuck in the electrical outlets and fuses blown
- knives scattered throughout the house and hidden in random areas
- Most of our Hunter Douglas custom blinds are broken 
- Board games & books ruined and thrown everywhere
-  She left a ton of her personal items everywhere. Many of these items we suspect may have been taken from other airbnbs: a ring camera, boardgames, home decor, artwork

Police are actively searching for her to lay charges. They had other calls that day about her. Last we heard from the police they found her car on the side on the road near the border somewhere hours and hours away from our Airbnb.  

Our regular home insurer is sending a remediation company to come and inspect the damage and provide a quote. We don’t know what our coverage will be yet (through Airbnb or through our insurer). 

I can’t explain how violating and unsettling it is to see our home destroyed in this way. The emotional toll is awful and sleep has been difficult. I couldn’t face seeing the worst part of the house and haven’t looked at that part (my fiance/cohost and the police did).

It doesn’t appear Airbnb shut down this guests profile so she may well be continuing this elsewhere. Since she hasn’t left a review for us, my review isn’t visible to other hosts yet. If you are a host: do not rent to a “Jessie” from Pittsburgh with a small white dog. 

Any advice from other hosts would be appreciated. We have extensively photographed and taken videos of everything and have been sending it all in to Airbnb. ",13,1756222204.0,airbnb_hosts,11,0.93,False
1n0ozo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1n0ozo3/met_a_guy_whos_now_ghosting_me/,"Met a guy, who’s now ghosting me","So I’ve been single 8 weeks, I wasn’t looking for ANYTHING serious. One day I’m out in the evening, looking for some you know what and well I started chatting to this guy. The vibe was great, the chat was there. Didn’t actually meet him that night for anything but found myself talking to him non stop all week. The end of the week he suggests coffee, I was honest, explained that I’m recently single and not looking for anything serious but we do get along and it would be great to meet him. 

We meet, it goes great! Go back to his, relax, chat, get pritty deep and then I go home. Afew days later, we meet again, have a full evening together, again super good chat, really deep conversations about life etc, watched a film, fell asleep in his arms and yeah, let’s say my guard was dropping. I could feel myself starting to really like him. After this for afew days I relax a little, then afew days later we chat again this time I did declare that I do actually like him, and I wanted to clarify while I’m not specifically looking for anything, I am open when the connection is there, and I do feel it with him. At which point he said he likes me too but feels I need to be free for a while as I’m recently single. A fair comment, but equally landing abit tough. From there he decided we should have some distance, ghosted me basically so I took it on the chin, didn’t chase just let it be. Is what it is. 

Wind forward to this weekend, Manchester pride. I’m there, I see he is there. Sent him a wee message, “you look good” just cos if I seen him I didn’t want anything to feel awkward. Then I head out, I see him and boom sparks again straight away. We then spend the whole day/evening and night together. The next day we went for a walk, back to the hotel and just cuddled before heading out into the village again for the evening. Everything was great, I felt really happy and to be honest, open and hoping to continue getting to know him. It was actually a really intense day/evening/night/next day together. Loads of cuddles, you know the kind where you can’t physically be any closer, and ofc abit of  … but hey, it’s pride and it was electric. Sometimes that kind of passion takes over. 

Then that evening, I go to the toilet come back out and boom he’s gone. Try to call, nothing. Send a text nothing. I assume he’s tired and just headed back, no panic just abit scared he’s gonna ghost me again. 


Well, he did. Now his insta is deactivated. I don’t know what I did wrong. I know I’m recently single, but I’m also very emotionally secure in myself. I allowed myself to lean into what felt so natural and now I’m here like, what the actual hell. 

All the while hoping he shows back up. 

For context he did say to me also he was struggling mentally, he was abit off the rails but in a normal human way. Yes abit chaotic, and yeah probs should have known better. But I kinda liked that realness about him. He’d told me about his struggles, I got it, no judgement just understanding. 

Cried today 😂 a guy whose last name I don’t even know, who was so intensely in my life for such a short period of time. Now gone, for good? Who knows. Anyone else been through this ",1,1756222183.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

This time I was greeted by the scent of a pine forest with a hint of cinnamon. My stomach began the morning routine of waging war on itself, a war fueled by coffee, copious amounts of chocolate milk, and a questionable gas station breakfast sandwich. The door creaked shut behind me like an old barn door. The throne was warm from a stranger’s sins but this time for the first time I felt completely unbothered. The air? Pleasant like I stepped from a desert hellscape into an enchanted cinnamon rainforest oasis. The throne? Clear of mysterious fluids. 30 minutes went by in the outside world but upon the throne, time stood still.

1n0ovnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1n0ovnu/reveal_if_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_hamilton/,Reveal if the Best Drip Coffee Maker Hamilton Beach 46299 Delivers,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach 46299 coffee maker has been an interesting experience over the past few weeks. As someone who starts their day with a warm cup of coffee, having a reliable coffee machine is necessary, not just nice to have. This sleek drip coffee maker promises a streamlined morning routine, programmable settings, and plenty of customization options, which immediately caught my attention. Although it delivers on most fronts, there are a few quirks that stood out during daily use. Let's dive in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and modern design of this coffee maker is definitely a standout feature. Its black exterior with stainless steel accents feels more premium than expected at first glance. It fits neatly on my kitchen counter, and I like that it doesn’t consume a lot of space. Measuring 9.5 inches deep, 11.4 inches wide, and 12.9 inches tall, finding a spot for it wasn’t hard. The cord storage feature, a seemingly small detail, kept my counter clutter-free and surprisingly made things look much tidier. Even the nonstick warming plate was a nice touch, as cleaning it was as easy as a quick wipe.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
In daily use, the Hamilton Beach coffee maker impressed with its consistent coffee brewing. The programmable timer is the hero here—no exaggeration. Setting it up the night before meant I woke up to the smell of fresh coffee, a lifesaver for groggy mornings. The Select-a-Brew feature gave me options for regular, bold, or smaller brews. My personal favorite is the bold setting, as it delivers richer, stronger coffee that packs a punch. For days when only a cup or two is required, the 1-4 cup option is a practical addition. Plus, the Auto Pause & Pour functionality actually works—I was able to sneak a cup mid-brew without spilling a drop!

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Good Aspects**  
- Sleek and space-saving design with stainless steel accents.  
- Programmable timer for freshly brewed coffee right when you wake up.  
- User-friendly buttons and clear setup for effortless operation.  
- Auto Pause & Pour feature for quick access to your first cup.  
- Dishwasher-safe carafe and brew basket for easier cleaning.  

**Bad Points**  
- The water reservoir isn’t removable, making the filling process slightly tricky.  
- A bit noisy during brewing, which might disturb a quiet early morning.  
- The coffee maker’s hot plate, while functional, only stays warm for 2 hours.  

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning is always a concern with coffee makers, but this one alleviates much of that stress. The 12-cup borosilicate glass carafe is dishwasher safe, as is the Lift & Clean brew basket. These are details I initially overlooked but came to appreciate after just a couple of uses. The hot plate being nonstick was another thoughtful design choice, though debris does occasionally build up in the small crevices along the edges of the brew basket area.

**Competing Products**  
Looking at similar models, a common rival is the Cuisinart DCC-3200, which offers slightly more brewing strength adjustments and a longer warm-keeping feature. However, I found the Hamilton Beach model’s compact design and easy-to-use interface preferable. Compared to the Keurig K-Duo, which handles both single-serve pods and drip brewer functions, this one is more stripped down, but it’s perfect for someone who values simplicity over multifunctionality.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This product lands in the sweet spot of offering strong performance without breaking the bank. While certain features like the lack of a longer warming time or more advanced brewing options might make it feel slightly less comprehensive than high-end coffee makers, it strikes a great balance for people looking for solid functionality at a reasonable cost.

She responded back with a vague response. Then July 2024, I asked her out again in chat and I told her that ""Hi [Her Name]! Remember when I invited you for coffee date last time? The offer still stands! Pray about it ""

She just read the message and did not reply back. Then I have the opportunity to have a clarity talk with her in person September 2024, if she is interested to go out for a coffee date or not. She told me that she is not interested

1n0oqny,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1n0oqny/stop_applying_for_jobs/,Stop applying for jobs....,"I have been looking for work since March. I would drop my daughter off at school, go to the local coffee shop, look at job postings, research relevant companies when I found a job I liked, target my resume, and apply on the company's site.  8-9 hours a day, every day, with no Luck.  
By chance, right before bed, I saw a recruiter (Chuck) post a job as a post on LinkedIn. I reached out, asked if he was the recruiter for the position to which he was not. He was just posting it because he loved the organization's mission and what they were about, but he offered to help me out in my job search.  We scheduled a call which went very well and then later the next day he started dumping links on me. SO MANY GOOD LINKS. But they weren't job postings. They were events. Seminars, Social Events, and NETWORKING EVENTS.

Chuck, led me down a road that has become invaluable to my job search, and taught me a couple of things along the way.   
*1. STOP APPLYING FOR JOBS (as your full time job.)*   
*2. Go out and take care of yourself, you'll get through the misery that is transition.*  
*3. Meet people. That is how you will find the position that is right for you, rather than a company that is toxic and soul draining.*   
*4. GO TO YOUR YOUR LIBRARY.*

**1. STOP APPLYING FOR JOBS (as your fulltime job)**  
Ok, so a little clickbait-esque for the title. But, applying for work as a full time job is going to be like running in sand.  You might get some bites and nibbles but it should really be focused to about 20-30% of your time. If you are an outlier and you've landed THAT'S GREAT! I am very happy for you (really). 

**2. Go out and take care of yourself.**  
Mental health is EXTREMELY important to your wellbeing as a person. 60-90 minuets a day. Go exercise, a walk, spend time just watching nature, find some quite, anything that makes you feel calm and relaxed.  You won't miss an opportunity because you are taking care of yourself for 4% of your 24 hour day.

**3. Meet People and Network - 80% of jobs are secured from networking.**  
This is where we strike gold. AND if you say ""I'm an introvert, I hate networking"", I'll say ""research shows that introverts are better at networking than extroverts"" and I'm not saying it to say it. Its a studied observation.  
Going out and networking does several things, but mainly it lets you meet people who can help you do your job hunt for you. Treat this like one of those godforsaken MLM illuminate Cult Pyramid Scheme companies. If each of your connections can provide you with just 2 connections and those are able to do the same, then its not long until you are able to reach the entirety of the US working population.  Feasible, not really but you get the idea. Just a few good connections can put you onto some solid leads!

**4. Go to your Library....DO IT NOW!**  
I just started going to a library that is about an hour away from me. Is it the closest, NOPE, but what it does have is a stellar Jobs & Careers resource. They hold meetings weekly with speakers from around the area, they have an amazing schedule of classes to teach people of all levels key skills and how to utilize resources, and they also have a staff of volunteer job coaches and career professionals to guide job seekers through their transition.  Will your library have these? Maybe, Maybe not. But Libraries are wizards when it comes to finding information and showing you how to find information as well.  Go, Ask, and Learn. You may be surprised if you haven't yet.

  
After this novella of a post. I just want to reiterate, get away from your screens, and start talking to real people. You'll be surprised what you learn and how it can help you find your next position along the way.

1n0oq2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1n0oq2t/evaluate_the_best_electric_kettle_chantal_mia_for/,Evaluate the Best Electric Kettle Chantal Mia for Pour Over Fans,"**Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03R CM Review: A Stylish and Reliable Everyday Companion**  

The Chantal Mia electric kettle ELSL37-03R CM caught my attention with its compact design and vibrant Matte Blue Ryder finish. As someone who relies on a kettle for multiple daily tasks, I decided to test it thoroughly to see if it lived up to its reputation. From its promise of safety features to quick boiling capabilities, this little device seemed to tick all the boxes. After weeks of use, both its strengths and minor quirks became apparent, and here's the honest take on how it performed.

**Design and Materials**  
This electric kettle definitely stands out in the kitchen. Its sleek, painted finish in Matte Blue Ryder feels modern while complementing the aesthetics of almost any countertop. Made primarily of 304 food-grade stainless steel, I appreciated that the inside is entirely free from plastics, ensuring no odd tastes or harmful chemicals in my water. The size is just right for small households or offices, with a 32-ounce (4-cup) capacity being enough for a couple of tea servings or pour-over coffees. What really made this design shine was the ergonomic heat-resistant handle. Whether I was filling it with water or pouring the perfect cup of tea, it felt sturdy and stayed cool to the touch—a subtle but important detail I came to appreciate during hurried mornings.  

**Patented Dual-Function Spout**  
One of the most unique aspects of this kettle is its patented dual-function spout. As someone who loves experimenting with pour-over coffee, the precise control offered by the slow-pour option quickly became a game changer. The fine-tuned design even cools boiling water to 205°F during the pour, hitting the sweet spot for brewing coffee. On the other hand, for quick tasks like filling a teapot or cooking oatmeal, the swift-flow function came in handy. I liked the flexibility this spout provided, eliminating the need to own separate kettles for coffee and general use.  

**Pros**  
- Architecturally pleasing with a minimalist, modern design.  
- All stainless-steel interior ensures water safety, free from rust and plastic.  
- Heat-resistant ergonomic handle for comfortable handling.  
- Dual-function spout tackles precise coffee brewing and everyday tasks.  
- Compact, lightweight, and ideal for small spaces.  

**Heating and Speed Performance**  
This 1000W kettle doesn’t waste time. I was impressed with how quickly it brought water to a boil, clocking around 3 minutes for a full 32-ounce load. It operates quietly, unlike some kettles that sound like a jet engine ready for takeoff. Auto shut-off made it a set-it-and-forget-it kind of device, while the boil-dry protection guaranteed peace of mind if I got too distracted and forgot to refill it. This feature proved invaluable during my busy work-from-home afternoons when I needed cups of tea in split-second breaks.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this electric kettle was straightforward thanks to the wide-opening lid. It's big enough to fit my hand and a cleaning cloth inside without any awkward maneuvering. Hard water areas sometimes make kettle cleaning a dreaded chore, but I only needed a quick rinse and occasional vinegar soak to prevent scale buildup. The interior gauge helped ensure accurate filling every time, which was a bonus when I only needed a single tea cup's worth of water.  

**Your Everyday Partner**  
This kettle quickly became my go-to for daily rituals. Whether it was whipping up a fresh herbal tea, brewing coffee in the morning, sterilizing baby bottles for my niece's little one, or making late-night ramen, it performed flawlessly. It’s amazing how such a seemingly small gadget could integrate into so many aspects of life. It doesn’t simply end at beverages—it heated the water I needed for all sorts of kitchen tasks.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Water capacity is limited to 32 ounces, which might not be sufficient for larger gatherings.  
- The painted exterior, while attractive, requires gentle handling to avoid scratches over long-term use.  
- Higher-priced compared to similar models in the market.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to its direct competitors like the popular Fellow Stagg kettle, the Chantal Mia holds its ground with its dual-function spout, which offers both precision and versatility. However, the Fellow Stagg offers slightly more advanced temperature controls and a sleeker build. On the other hand, budget models such as Hamilton Beach lack Mia’s stylish design and premium materials but are more accommodating for those on a tighter budget. For anyone prioritizing aesthetics, safety, and user-friendliness, this particular kettle remains a solid choice among its peers.  

**Value for Money**  
When talking about price-to-quality ratio, you’re not just paying for a regular electric kettle here; you’re buying a premium small appliance. The material quality, attention to safety features like auto shut-off and boil-dry protection, and unique pour options cater to people who love precision and a bit of luxury in their kitchen. While it’s priced higher than your average kettle, the features justify the tag for those who’ll fully utilize its capacities.

Some time passed and we started talking during coffee breaks and I noticed she touched my shoulder twice which I took as a friendly aproach, but lately I can notice she always seems a bit too excited when I turn to my colleagues for a coffee break. And today as I was talking about my work with my colleagues (as a graphic designer) she liked one of my works and came pretty close to the monitor like really close to me, which was a bit weird and yesterday she said that I have the same shirt her ex left her and jokingly that we should put them together some day. This really made me uncomfortable back then and I put some borders to that - it's not happening and that this is weird to say.

She also said she saw my Wife on Facebook (since we're friends there) and that she's too cute and all, today as we were having lunch with the entire team she said the food I brought looks delicious, and if my wife did it - which she did and I added that she cooks very very well, which isn't a lie and then the conversation in this direction died.

I am pretty sure she might have some attraction to it, honestly, not used to being as attractive throughout the years so I can't fully decide if she has it for me or not, but if she does that would make me feel very uncomfortable.

1n0ojmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1n0ojmz/top_10_small_business_ideas_in_columbus_ohio_to/,"Top 10 small business ideas in Columbus, Ohio to start this year","  
  
hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in columbus? good call. this city is growing like crazy and there are a ton of opportunities if you know where to look. i've started a few businesses here myself and wanted to share some ideas, especially the ones you probably haven't thought of.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one: a specialized moving service for students and young professionals. with ohio state and the growing number of young people moving to columbus, there's a constant need for movers who can handle small-scale moves, like a single room or a small apartment. you could offer packing services and storage options too. not gonna lie, the logistics can be a pain, but if you're organized, it's a pretty solid opportunity. startup costs would be relatively low if you start with a used van and some basic equipment, probably in the $5,000 - $10,000 range.  
  
2. here's a non-obvious one for you: Prked. you can start a parking space rental business right from your home in Columbus. if you have a driveway, garage, or even just some extra space in your yard, you can rent it out to people who need parking. short-term parking near popular spots like the short north or the arena district would be a goldmine on game days and weekends. but honestly, the real money is in monthly parking. so many people who live in apartments or condos with limited parking would love to have a dedicated spot. it's a great way to make passive income, and since parking is a headache in many parts of columbus, you'd be providing a real solution.  
  
3. a mobile pet grooming service. people in columbus love their pets, but not everyone has the time to take their furry friends to the groomer. a mobile service that comes to them would be a game-changer. you could start with a specially equipped van and offer a range of services, from baths and haircuts to nail trims and teeth cleaning. startup costs would be a bit higher for this one, probably in the $20,000 - $40,000 range to get a good van and equipment.  
  
4. a curated gift box service featuring local columbus products. there are so many amazing small businesses in columbus making everything from artisanal chocolates and coffee to handmade soaps and candles. you could partner with these businesses to create unique gift boxes for different occasions, like birthdays, holidays, and corporate events. it's a great way to support the local community and offer a really special product. you could start this business from home with a low initial investment, probably under $5,000.  
  
5. a healthy meal prep and delivery service. with so many busy professionals and families in columbus, there's a huge demand for healthy and convenient meal options. you could offer a weekly subscription service with a rotating menu of delicious and nutritious meals. this is a pretty competitive market, but if you can carve out a niche, like focusing on a specific dietary need or using only locally sourced ingredients, you could do really well. startup costs would depend on whether you're using a commercial kitchen or starting from home, but you could probably get started for around $10,000 - $20,000.  
  
6. a home organizing and decluttering service. let's be real, everyone has too much stuff. a business that helps people organize their homes and get rid of clutter would be a lifesaver for so many people in columbus. you could offer a range of services, from a one-time decluttering session to ongoing organizing support. startup costs are super low for this one, you really just need a good website and some basic supplies, so you could get started for under $2,000.  
  
7. a handyman service specializing in small jobs. it can be really hard to find someone to do those small jobs around the house, like hanging a picture, fixing a leaky faucet, or assembling furniture. if you're handy and reliable, you could build a really successful business just by focusing on these small tasks. startup costs are minimal, you just need some basic tools and a way to get around town, so you could probably get started for under $3,000.  
  
8. a social media management agency for small businesses. so many small businesses in columbus know they need to be on social media, but they just don't have the time or expertise to do it well. if you're a social media whiz, you could offer your services to help these businesses grow their online presence. you could start this business from home with a very low initial investment, probably under $1,000.  
  
9. a personal shopping and styling service. with a growing number of young professionals and a thriving fashion scene in columbus, there's a real opportunity for a personal shopping and styling service. you could help people build a wardrobe they love, find the perfect outfit for a special occasion, or just feel more confident in their clothes. you could start this business with a low initial investment, probably under $2,000.  
  
10. a food truck specializing in a unique cuisine. columbus has a great food truck scene, but there's always room for something new and exciting. if you have a passion for a particular type of food that's not well-represented in the city, a food truck could be a great way to get your start. startup costs are higher for this one, you'll need to buy or lease a truck and get it outfitted, so you're probably looking at an investment of $50,000 or more.

1n0ogqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1n0ogqq/should_you_try_vanish_pre_treat_stain_remover_gel/,Should You Try Vanish Pre Treat Stain Remover Gel for Laundry?,"I recently tried out the Vanish Pre Treat Stain Remover Gel, and I must say, it quickly found its place in my laundry arsenal. This stain remover gel promises to tackle stubborn stains with its powerful and fast-acting formula, and I was eager to see how well it performed on the unexpectedly tough stains my toddler creates. From food smudges to paint splatters, I tested it on a variety of fabrics, and the results were quite surprising.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features of this product is its ergonomically designed bottle. The gel comes in a compact, user-friendly container that fits nicely in your hand, and the dispenser makes it easy to target specific stains without wasting the product. I found this especially helpful when dealing with small, tricky spots on clothing. Additionally, the clear, easy-to-follow application instructions on the packaging left no room for confusion, which is always a plus in my book!

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
The effectiveness truly impressed me. With its super-boosted formula, it worked wonders on dried, set-in stains that had me almost ready to toss some items out. I applied the gel directly to the affected areas, let it sit for a few minutes as advised, and then threw the garments into the wash. More often than not, the stains disappeared after the first wash. What caught my attention most was its ability to tackle a myriad of stains like grease, coffee, and even mud on both colored and white fabrics, performing consistently on all of them.

**Check Vanish Pre Treat Stain Remover Gel price on Amazon.**

**Suitability for Different Fabrics**  
What sets this stain remover apart is how versatile it is. It claims to be suitable for both whites and colors, and it held true to its word during my tests. I used it on my kid’s white school shirt, my colorful workout clothes, and even delicate silk fabric, and there was no fading or damage in sight. It's been a lifesaver for restoring several garments I had labeled as ""beyond saving."" However, I always recommend doing a test patch on a hidden area, especially for more delicate fabrics, just to be safe.

**Good Aspects**  
- Effectively removes tough stains, even ones that are dried on.  
- Safe for use on whites and colored fabrics alike.  
- Simple and straightforward to use with clear instructions.  
- Compact packaging makes storage effortless.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The gel has a strong scent, which might be off-putting for those sensitive to fragrances.  
- Not as effective for larger or heavily embedded stains without multiple applications.  
- Some fabrics may require longer treatment times for optimal results.

**Market Rivals**  
When comparing it to other popular stain remover products like OxiClean MaxForce and Resolve Pre-Treat Spray, the Vanish gel really shines due to its targeted application and fast action. While OxiClean offers comparable stain-removal power, the gel form of Vanish feels more controlled and less messy to use. On the other hand, Resolve’s spray format is great for convenience but lacks the precision Vanish provides for tackling smaller, stubborn spots. However, the scent of Vanish is slightly stronger than both, which might be a dealbreaker for sensitive users.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given its features and performance, this product offers excellent value if you’re fighting everyday stains. While there are cheaper alternatives in the market, most don’t deliver comparable results on a wide range of fabrics and stains. Investing in this gel feels worthwhile, especially if you're frequently dealing with tricky stains from kids, pets, or an active lifestyle.

I'm in college and was studying in the library the other day.so their is this girl,I am her senior and she knows me well like we had talked earlier about studies in library itself, so I messaged her asking if she wanted to grab coffee. At first, she said no(she is so introverted), but I was persistent (maybe a little too much?), and she eventually agreed.
We went to the cafe, and she told me she doesn't actually drink coffee; she just came along for the company. We ended up chatting for a while about our hometowns, families, and hobbies. It was a really nice conversation, but now I'm wondering... was this a coffee date?

1n0oe6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n0oe6q/location_uk_df564_versions_cost_and_plug_options/,"[Location: UK] DF[56]4 - versions, cost, and plug options?","All of the locations I've found selling the DF54 or DF64 gen II worldwide (\[MiiCoffee\](https://miicoffee.shop/products/miicoffee-df54-single-dose-coffee-grinder), etc) list the version for UK sale as '220v, EU plug with UK adapter'. I'm really short on space, even depth, on my countertop, so a chunky adapter on the plug socket is something I really want to avoid (plus it just doesn't look great).  
  
The UK stockists of the DF range \_don't\_ specify that on their sales pages: \[Bella Barista\](https://bellabarista.co.uk/products/the-solo-df54), \[Sigma Coffee\](https://sigmacoffee.co.uk/products/df-df54), \[Earl Coffee\](https://earlcoffee.co.uk/products/df54-electric-coffee-grinder-by-earl) etc.

So, question 1: Plug.

Can anyone who has bought a DF54 or DF64 gen II in the UK confirm that they received it with a UK plug on the cable? And was that from a UK or worldwide stockist? I would be more than happy and capable to chop the EU plug off and fit my own UK one, but I suspect doing so would completely invalidate the warranty... I also don't want to go with a UK stockists specifically to get a UK fitted plug, if they still don't come with one.

Question 2: Price, UK vs international.

MiiCoffee lists the DF64 gen II as \~£300, which is a significant saving on the \~£400 to get it from a UK stockist. Same with the DF54 at \~£180 vs \~£240. \_But\_ it also says that this doesn't include shipping (only calculated at checkout) or, crucially, VAT. UK VAT being 20% I'm looking at at least £360 even before any shipping costs. Assuming UK shipping from a UK stockist is free/included (at these prices it should be IMO, and normally is). Plus UK stockists give the legal 2 years warranty as standard, where MiiCoffee is only 1. So suddenly the price advantage of buying from a supplier outside the UK seems pretty nonexistent.

Question 3: Versions.

I'll be pairing this with a Sage (Breville) Bambino. Not even the Plus. One day I might upgrade to something like an \[Apex v2\](https://sigmacoffee.co.uk/products/gemilai-apex-v2-espresso-machine), but I'm unlikely to go beyond that, and even that would require shuffling (and spousal negotiation) to make space. I'm currently using the Sage Smart Grinder Pro, but I really want to try flat burrs as I prefer to be able to make out individual flavours as much as possible.

I could \_technically\_ afford the DF64v, but that's a lot to drop when I've never even tried a flat burr grinder before. And it's more than the coffee machine cost, but I understand the grinder tends to be the more important part. But is the Bambino just too low-end for a good grinder to make really good coffee on it, so it'd be wasted on me?

The DF64 gen II is £400, so still a fair whack. Then the DF54 is £240. I'm unlikely to ever disappear down the rabbit hole of different burr sets, but I'm having trouble even finding replacements for the stock burrs available anywhere for the DF54. Has anyone had to replace their burrs on theirs yet? How awkward was that? Is there any other advantage of the DF64 apart from being able to get different burrs (And it being chunkier, which is a disadvantage in my limited space)?",1,1756220866.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

She excused herself from the table and walked to the patio of the little Parisian coffee and wine bar, the cool night air caressing her heated skin. Her slinky silk dress didn’t cover up much, but she still felt like she was going to melt into a puddle if she sat next to Michael a minute longer.*

*She took a deep breath and gazed out at the glittering skyline, the Eiffel Tower standing like a proud beauty amidst the other architecture. Maybe love really was in the air in this city.* 

*Or maybe it was just the wine she’d had. Or they way Michael’s big, warm hand had rested on her thigh under the table. She’d found herself biting her lip, wishing his fingers would inch just a little higher.*

*But no, she couldn’t lose her head tonight. It was all just an act. Michael just needed a plus-one to show off to his high-class colleagues, and as his nanny, Anelise was the easiest option available. After tonight, this delicious dream would be over, and the two of them would go back to the way things were.*

*Anelise tried to tell herself that was for the best. But then she felt a familiar warm body brush up beside her at the railing, and she lost all her resolve.*

*“Something wrong?” Michael asked in his husky baritone.*

*She looked up into his clear green eyes and suddenly found her own filling with tears. Concern etched itself into his handsome face and he lifted a hand to her face, brushing away a traitorous tear with his thumb.* 

*“None of this is real,” she whispered, afraid to break the spell.*

*His eyes dipped to her lips and he leaned in closer. “Do you want it to be real?” he asked.*

*Anelise’s head spun. He was too close. She’d had too much to drink. The flowers in full bloom all around the patio filled the air with a sweetness that made her dizzy.* 

*She knew it wasn’t the smart answer. But when she opened her mouth, all she could say was, “Yes.”*

*Then Michael’s mouth was on hers, and she didn’t need to worry about what to say anymore. Maybe tomorrow, she would wake up back in reality where he was her employer and she was his nanny. But tonight, she would enjoy the dream that they belonged together.*

\*\*\*

“You’ve got to be kidding me, Kathy,” said Michael in disbelief, completely thrown off kilter.

“I’m so sorry, Michael. But I’m already in Vegas with Shawn. After we tie the knot, we’re going on a long honeymoon,” Kathy replied.

“We’re leaving in two weeks!” Michael winced at his tone and lowered his voice. Kathy was adamant about never yelling at his kid, so he figured he owed her the same courtesy. “What am I going to do without a nanny?” 

“I regret leaving on such short notice, but you’ll have to find someone else. When it’s love, it’s love. You understand, don’t you?”

“Yeah, sure,” Michael grumbled. He didn’t, really. 

“Can you say goodbye to Ollie for me?” she asked softly.

“I will. He’ll miss you,” he said before hanging up. Then he threw the phone on the table, cursing, “Son of a bitch!”

“What’s wrong, Michael?” Kim inquired. Kathy had called him in the middle of lunch with his neighbors, the Morgans.

“Oh, nothing, just my nanny quitting on me!” he fumed as he leaned back in the chair, running his fingers through his hair.

“Kathy just up and quit right before your big trip?” Neil asked, leading a cherubic little boy to the table with a sippy cup of milk.

Michael definitely had to mind his tone in front of his son. “She’s in Vegas, eloping,” he gritted out.

“Wow,” Kim said. “I never knew she was such a romantic.”

Romance caused more problems than it was worth in Michael’s opinion. Not that he ever regretted Ollie, but his mother… There were a lot of regrets there. 

“I just had a thought,” said Neil, squeezing his wife’s hand. “What about our daughter, Anelise? She’s almost done with her semester and loves to babysit.”

“Really?” Michael was willing to grasp at any glimmer of hope. “Do you think she would be interested in spending her summer nannying?”

“Oh, I think it would be perfect for her!” Kim enthused. “I’m sure she’d rather work for a trusted friend of the family than some summer job where they just want to take advantage of her.”

Neil nodded. “She’s a good girl, never gets in trouble, maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA. And she doesn’t party, even though she has a rowdy roommate. She’ll be a great influence on little Ollie,” he said, ruffling the kid’s hair.

“How old is she again?” Michael asked.

“She’ll be turning twenty-one in October,” Kim beamed.

Michael didn’t hate the idea. She really did sound like a good kid. “Well, may I have her number? I’ll give her a call and see what she thinks.”

“Of course. I’ll text her to give her a heads-up,” said Neil.

Michael glanced at the pictures of the neighbors’ daughter on the walls. She was a chubby young woman with glasses, dark auburn hair, and a nice smile. She looked like an archetypal bookworm, every bit as responsible as her parents claimed.

\*\*\*

Anelise was making notes for the thesis proposal that she would be writing over the summer. She had to turn it in after the final, but she just wasn’t pleased with it. She wanted something more, but didn’t know what.

When she was discussing her proposal with Professor Andrews, she had felt it was lacking something, some excitement or passion, some spark that ignited her soul.

Professor Andrews, on the other hand, said what she had would make a good final project. But Anelise didn’t want just good; she wanted her thesis to be great.

Anelise sighed as she went to get a cup of sweet tea, which she allowed herself to have once a day. She believed that if she didn’t limit herself, the weight loss she had worked so hard for would go down the drain.

She took a long sip, feeling thankful that her roommate and best friend, Leslie, was out having Sunday brunch with her ridiculously wealthy family and the apartment was quiet so she could stew in peace.

She was walking around her room, trying to clear her head to study for the rest of her finals, when her phone rang.

Without recognizing the number, but seeing the Chicago area code, she figured it could be the neighbor that her parents had said might call with an interesting proposal.

“Hello?” she answered.

“Hello. Is this Anelise?” asked the caller in a deep baritone. Her name in that voice sent goosebumps tingling all over her body. She shook herself out of it. The stress of finals must be getting to her.

“Yes, this is Anelise. How can I help you?”

“My name is Michael Whitlock. Your parents gave me your number. I’m their neighbor,” he explained.

“Yes, they mentioned that you might be calling with a proposal. What can I do for you?”

“Well, I know this is completely out of left field, but I’m in one hell of a bind. Your parents mentioned that you like kids and have done some babysitting jobs before. My nanny quit yesterday. She’s eloping, if you can believe it.”

“That’s awfully romantic,” she said with a smile.

He sighed. “Very. The problem is, I’m leaving for three months for work and she was supposed to come with us and watch my son, Ollie. Is that something you might be interested in? I’ll pay you handsomely.""

She bit her lip, more money would be welcome. She had come to really enjoy shopping with Leslie since she had lost so much weight.

“Well, I’m not sure... I’m going to be writing my master’s thesis…”

“I know. Your parents told me. They said you might like to know we’d be in London for the summer. You would get days off to explore and do research for your paper.”

“Seriously?!” Analise took in a sharp breath.

“Yes, we’d leave in thirteen days, and I’d be paying you $1,500 per week. Food and accommodation would be covered by my company, of course. But I’ll be working *a lot*, and you’d be responsible for Ollie well into the nights.”",1,1756220827.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1n0oa2h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0oa2h,"An Unforgettable Experience at Geranium***, Copenhagen","Sat at the Kitchen Table at Geranium the night following dining at Plenitude. One of my most anticipated meals for several years, I was actually a bit worried going into the meal following how epic Plenitude was, but within the first few bites of Geranium, I knew I had nothing to worry about.

You are first greeted by a host outside of the stadium the restaurant is located in, who then guides you to the eighth floor. From the art to the elegant simplicity of the decor to the sheer number of staff that are constantly in motion, I was in awe of the space and energy from the outset. In terms of the kitchen table vs. normal dining room, I’d say for a first experience eating there, I have no regrets around choosing the kitchen table. Sure there is staff constantly moving around you and other diners walking by you on their kitchen tours, but having such a clear view of the kitchen at work and feeling the passion the staff puts into each of their dishes and seeing how intentional each of their movements are feels special. Being able to witness small moments like the assistant head chef discussing what the best dish of the night was at the end of the night with other junior chefs to coaching more junior members on the team on cleaning technique was a testament to how a young staff is able to develop so well and be so in sync.

Shifting to the food, the meal kicked off with oysters in crispy algae with cucumber, dill, and aquavit. In similar fashion to Plenitude that also kicked off with an oyster dish, this bite was stunning but my least favorite bite of the night. It felt like several other Nordic bites I’ve had pairing fresh seafood with the lightness of local herbs and vegetables but the flavors felt a bit too restrained for me. Was basically a more aesthetically beautiful version of a bite I’ve had many times before. (14/20)

Next was the lightly smoked bleak roe with milk and kale. This was everything I could ask for in an opening dish and was one of the best roe dishes I’ve ever had. The perfect amount of smokiness to complement the sea saltiness of the roe. Not sure what the crispy little crouton-like component was but holy. The dish felt crunchy and like it could melt in your mouth all at once. (19.5/20)

Danish salted mackerel with thyme flowers and “essence of tomatoes” convinced me that I’d just had the wrong mackerel preparations all my life. I often struggle with the super metallic taste of mackerel and often hear chefs describe it as one of their favorite fishes but struggled to understand why. I understand now. With the sweetness and umami of the tomato broth, it just balanced the fish perfectly and brought out the best parts of it. Wow. (19/20)

Geranium’s daily harvest with pickled pine and smoked cheese rounded out the appetizers. I’ll poke fun at fine dining sometimes for putting some vegetables on a plate and waxing poetic about how their piece of squash is different from any other. Had to eat my words after trying this. This assortment of oxalis, celery, broccoli, squash, tomatoes and radishes all had such distinct flavors that made me re-evaluate how beautiful vegetables could be. My friend couldn’t help but laugh after trying the tomato confused at how a tomato could evoke such a candy-like sweetness. The smoked cheese dip tasted like a light Mediterranean dip that complemented each vegetable so well. (18/20)

Shifting to the “savory servings”, this started with kohlrabi, söl (seaweed), raw apple, pumpkin seed oil, and Danish caviar. One of my favorite plated dishes I’ve seen, it looked like squid tentacles, and the combination of the kohlrabi and söl captured the flavor and texture of squid as well. With the nuttiness of the pumpkin seed oil and saltiness from the caviar, this was just so perfectly balanced and delicious. (19.5/20)

Followed by brown mushrooms with lightly smoked egg yolk, and fermented kale foam. Egg yolk and mushrooms will always be a cheat code. (18/20)

Next was one of the most creative bread courses I’ve had that included one of my top 5 favorite bites I’ve ever had. Consisted of three different breads with this heavenly cep butter. The steamed and fried bread with cheese (comte I believe), caramelized shallots, and black truffle was simply perfection. This bite was richness restrained in the best way. The crunchy grain bread dipped in the cep butter was great, but saving this to dip in the next course of grilled vegetable and potato soup with asparagus beer and a mountain of Australian black truffle was even crazier. Eating this felt like a heightened emotional experience I didn’t want to end. I think I audibly moaned eating this and must have frightened the staff but just couldn’t help it. 20/20

The scallop with juniper and elderflower was buttery in a way I’d normally love but may have suffered from following the bread and soup courses. Felt like it was cooked 10 seconds over, and I think if this was cooked on higher heat for a bit less time, would’ve potentially added more crisp on the outside while maintaining the melt in your mouth flesh and been a standout dish. As someone allergic to lobster, this was about as close as I can get which I appreciated. (16/20)

Last savory course was the hake with beach plants and horseradish. The hake was crusted with parsley and other herbs and the lemon and mustard seeds added a nice punch with the horseradish. (17.5/20)

First dessert course was chamomile, green strawberry, buttermilk, and vanilla oil. The flower tuile on top was such detailed perfection that it felt painful to take my first bite of it. Bringing some of my favorite ingredients together in such harmony, yum. (17.5/20)

Chocolate with Jerusalem artchichoke, prunes, and grain coffee was next. Was a bit of a chocolate overload for me but I could see chocolate lovers adoring this course. (15/20)

Last course was a tart with sunflower seeds and plums glazed with fig leaves served with some fresh berries on the side. Not overly sweet, just right. Fantastic closer. (18/20)

Looking back on this meal, I’m so excited that it felt like I got to experience a top restaurant operating in their prime. Sitting at the kitchen table felt like what I imagine watching a symphony or ballet on a grand scale is like. There are 40+ staff members in perfect sync with each other, one dropping two drops of oil on a dish immediately followed by someone masterfully pouring a beaker of velvety sauce, followed by someone picking up the dish the second it is complete and gliding over to your table. The staff is engaging, the flavors are superb, the meal is filling, and the experience regularly leaves you speechless. Truly worth the journey.",29,1756220621.0,finedining,3,1.0,False

I self isolate because I only really feel safe & calm when I’m alone. Other people are scary and potentially dangerous.

I struggle to keep in contact because people just really don’t excite me at all. A social event or even going to get coffee together is always a burden, and I only feel exhaustion towards it. After being with other people, I feel mostly just  exhausted and annoyed.

I feel like it would be good for me to have more people in my life, but I have no idea how to make more friends or how to feel anything other than exhausting and annoyance for the prospect of having to ever meet them or text them.

My best friend is a beautiful soul. She is funny, loving, smart, and kind. She also has BPD. When she gets emotionally escalated or feels criticized, she gets lost in self-loathing and rapidly becomes emotionally abusive until the spiral is over and she feels ashamed and guilty. We've been friends for 10 years, and I don't see her BPD-self as her ""true self"" if that makes sense. I am committed to supporting her. 

A year ago she spun up a local book club that I'm a member of. It's become a loosely associated group of \~20 folks who gather every other week for coffee and to chat about our current read. It historically had been going well, but recently she has been getting feedback on some of the structure, book choices, etc that she has taken very personally. It culminated with her spiraling, being rude to various members publicly, and kicking out someone from the group (who wasn't even in conflict with her). 

Myself and a few other members approached her individually yesterday (not knowing the others were) and suggested gently that she step down as the leader to give herself some space from the criticism and heal. She did agree but expressed feeling forced, extremely paranoid, that everyone hates her, and is deep in self-loathing. This morning, she is upbeat, says she is excited and has a ""great idea"" for this that she will tell me on Friday when we next hang out.

Frankly: I'm scared for her. I am worried this happiness is either grandiose thinking or her hiding being in a very bad place. What can I do right now and over the next few weeks to make sure she has all the support she needs?

1n0o1h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1n0o1h1/good_days_still_happen/,Good Days still happen,"About a month ago I decided no more stealth mode because hrt changes became much to obvious to do so. The twins got big and my face feminised a lot. Also with hips forming and a very obvious hourglass figure I had no choice.

The only issue however was my hair. Previously shaven close and now nearly touching my shoulders. And did you know that estrogen can curl your hair? I didn't and it was a big curly mess instead of the totally straight haire before

So now the search for a hair salon started. Everyone friendly, untill they realise I am trans. One of the replies was that their stylists weren't trained to cut transgender hair. Wow. One told me straight that it is against her beliefs and morals to cut a transgender's hair. I actually thanked her for her honesty since by then I have heard about 20 excuses and stories.

Well, as they say Google is your friend and I started searching. Via a picture search I saw a salon that just might work - some very funky and obviously queer and gender neutral styles in the pics. So I phoned and they replied that I would be most welcome. I booked then for a Saturday past appointment. They were in a different town and I would have to drive about an hour to get there..

Saturday came and I dressed in a new pair of skinny jeans and a matching top with jewellery to match, feeling very fem.  
Struggling to find the salon, I asked for directions from locals. Maybe because it is a student town, everyone on the streat were very friendly, no strange looks and no misgendering. Even a beggar on the street called me lady! He received a very generous donation in return.

Found the salon and was warmly greeted by everyone inside, staff and customers included. The stylist discussed possible styles with me and we settled on a curly pixie cut. I swear that as he was cutting, a smile appeared on my face getting bigger and bigger all the time. I imagined a butterfly emerging.   
After the cut and style, I then had a brow shape and lashes done. The salon then offered a complimentary facial and it felt like a dream. I stepped out of that salon a new woman.  
Afterward I went to a coffee shop where I was adressed as Miss, and when I asked the waitress for directions to the restrooms, she directed me to the ladies. Unbelievable and a dream I thought.

Not once, during the whole day, was I misgendered or talked about in a negative way or even have to feel uncertain or embarred or scared.  It was the best day of my life and shows how it can be in a tolerable accepting society that takes you for who you are inside and not for a polititians cautionary tale. I wish this feeling for everyone.",7,1756220083.0,MtF,2,1.0,False
1n0o19x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleMentality/comments/1n0o19x/top_10_small_business_ideas_in_san_diego_ca_to/,"Top 10 small business ideas in San Diego, CA to start this year","  
  
hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in san diego? good call. this city is honestly a great place to be an entrepreneur, but it's not always easy to figure out what to do. i've been around the block a few times with my own ventures here, and i've seen a lot of businesses come and go. so i wanted to share some ideas that i think have some real potential right now. and not just the same old stuff you see on every list.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one: a ""blue economy"" business. san diego is a huge hub for ocean research and technology, and there are some really cool opportunities here. you could start a small-scale sustainable seaweed or shellfish farm in the bay. it's good for the environment and there's a growing market for local, sustainable seafood. or, if you're more tech-minded, you could develop and sell ocean monitoring sensors or even smart buoys. the port of san diego is actively encouraging these kinds of businesses. startup costs can vary a lot here, from a few thousand for a small aquaculture setup to more for a tech-based business, but the potential is huge.  
  
2. another one you probably haven't considered is a parking spot rental business with Prked. seriously, parking in san diego is a nightmare, especially near the beaches and downtown. you can rent out your driveway, garage, or even a spot in your yard as a parking space. it's a pretty solid opportunity for passive income. you can offer short-term parking for people heading to the beach or to a padres game, or monthly parking for people who live in crowded neighborhoods with no street parking. so many people in san diego need monthly parking for their cars, boats or rvs. it's a super flexible business and you can get started with pretty much no money if you already have the space.  
  
3. how about a business focused on affordable pet services? the local animal shelters are overflowing, and a big reason is that people are struggling with the cost of pet care. you could start a mobile vet clinic that offers low-cost vaccinations and basic check-ups. or a subscription-based service for pet food and supplies that's cheaper than the big pet stores. there's a real need in the community for this, and you'd be doing something good too. startup costs would depend on what you offer, but a mobile service could be started for less than a traditional brick-and-mortar.  
  
4. ok, here's a fun one: a community-focused fitness business. people in san diego are super active, but they're also looking for a sense of community. instead of another generic gym, think about something more unique. maybe a hiking group that meets up at different trails every week and then goes for coffee afterwards. or a ""sober-curious"" social club that organizes fun, active events that don't revolve around drinking. the startup costs for something like this would be pretty low, mostly just marketing and your own time.  
  
5. a niche food truck. yeah, i know, food trucks aren't a new idea. but there's still room for new and interesting concepts. instead of the usual tacos or burgers, think about something more specific. maybe a truck that only sells healthy, plant-based meals. or a dessert truck that specializes in one thing, like gourmet ice cream sandwiches or churros with unique dipping sauces. the key is to find a niche that isn't already saturated and to have really, really good food. startup costs for a food truck can be anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000, depending on the truck and the equipment.  
  
6. an eco-tourism company. san diego is a beautiful place, and people come from all over the world to see it. you could start a business that offers guided tours with an environmental focus. maybe a kayak tour of the la jolla sea caves where you talk about the local marine life and conservation efforts. or a bird-watching tour of the tijuana river estuary. you'd be surprised how many people are looking for a more meaningful and educational travel experience. startup costs would be relatively low, mostly just your own gear and some marketing.  
  
7. a personal concierge service for seniors. san diego has a large and growing senior population. a lot of them are still active and independent, but they could use a little help with things like grocery shopping, running errands, or getting to appointments. you could start a business that provides this kind of personalized assistance. it's a great way to help people in your community and build a business at the same time. startup costs would be minimal, mostly just transportation and marketing.  
  
8. a co-working space with a twist. there are already a lot of co-working spaces in san diego, but most of them are pretty standard. you could create a space that's tailored to a specific niche. maybe a space for artists with a studio and gallery. or a space for tech startups with a focus on collaboration and networking. the key is to create a community, not just a place to work. startup costs would be significant, mostly for rent and renovations, but if you can find the right niche, it could be a big success.  
  
9. a mobile car detailing service. this is a classic for a reason. people in san diego love their cars, and they're willing to pay to keep them looking good. a mobile service is great because you can go to your customers, whether they're at home or at work. you can start with a pretty basic setup and then expand as you get more clients. startup costs are relatively low, mostly just for equipment and supplies.  
  
10. a home organizing and decluttering service. life can get messy, and a lot of people are willing to pay for help getting their homes in order. this is a business you can start with very little money and a lot of hard work. if you're a naturally organized person and you enjoy helping people, this could be a great fit for you.  
  
i hope this helps someone out. starting a business is a lot of work, but it's also incredibly rewarding. and in a city like san diego, the sky's the limit. good luck",1,1756220071.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

I’d love to know:

* Would this kind of coffee shop appeal to you or do you think people want the sugary/milkshake-esque drinks too much for something like this to work?
* What would make or break it for you if this opened in your city?

My wife and I were trying to conceive our first and only child. We were at it for maybe around a year trying to get pregnant, with no luck. 

So fast forward to a trip to my In-Laws for Thanksgiving. That morning I was getting ready to go play some golf with my wife’s uncle and my wife came up to me and asked me to go and get a pregnancy test. Now, this has happened maybe 4-5 times throughout the year, so I didn’t think anything of it. 

I went down to the drug store real fast and bought two. Came back and her uncle was already at the house waiting on me to come back so we can go play. I walk up to my wife and hand her the bag of tests. Told her I would see her here in a few hours. 

So we drive to the golf course and I was thinking about the tests. By hole 3 or so, I thought about why she hasn’t texted me the news yet, and then it dawned on me, no way she is going to text me that she is pregnant, but she would text me that it was negative. I knew at that moment that she was pregnant. The next 15 holes I was just grinning ear to ear. Played terrible. 

After the round I get back to the house and immediately look at her and smile. She knew I knew. 

Funny thing is, she took the test and then went back out into the kitchen. Her Mom, my MIL, asked her if she wanted a coffee, as she was making a pot. My wife said, “no she didn’t need one.”  My MIL immediately looked at her and asked, “Are you pregnant?”  

It literally took my MIL 3 minutes to find it out. 

Sorry, the story just puts a smile on my face. ",214,1756219613.0,pregnant,8,1.0,False

A breakfast rich in fiber (whole-grain bread, oatmeal, fruits) and protein (eggs, milk, and nuts) calms the body and keeps you from getting caught up in a vicious cycle of overthinking, hunger, and anxiety. The issue is that many of us choose quick fixes like cookies, coffee without food, or a lot of sugar in the morning rush. At this point, the day starts off lacking in energy. Which breakfast, in your opinion, best helps you begin the day feeling relaxed and at ease?

1n0nt2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacSources/comments/1n0nt2x/uwant_d100_wet_dry_vacuum_review_effortless/,UWANT D100 Wet Dry Vacuum REVIEW Effortless Hard-Floor Cleaning Made Easy,"https://preview.redd.it/ix64hmaamdlf1.jpg?width=1575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d60dce269e2c64dbba6c6b22e1f2159912602a4

Keeping my floors clean has always felt like a time-consuming chore. I remember when my mom would spend hours mopping our kitchen floor because it involved moving the table and chairs to cover the entire area. She would sweep, spot clean, and then mop. While that can still be necessary, wet dry [vacuums](https://macsources.com/?s=vacuum), like the D100 from UWANT, can turn this time-consuming task into a quick, painless one.

# About D100 Cordless Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner

UWANT is a home appliance brand known for integrating smart technology, modern design, and user-friendly features into household cleaning tools. The company focuses on creating solutions that minimize effort while maximizing efficiency, bringing convenience and innovation into everyday home care.

The UWANT D100 Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner reflects this approach by combining vacuuming and mopping into a single cordless system. It offers powerful suction up to 17,000 Pa, an Intelligent Floor Sensing System (IFSS) that adjusts performance based on surface conditions, and an 18-path precision spray for even, streak-free cleaning. Maintenance is simplified through a self-cleaning function and hot-air drying system, which keep the roller brush hygienic and odor-free after use. Lightweight and designed for easy maneuverability, the D100 makes quick work of both wet and dry messes, offering a streamlined solution for maintaining hard floors.

# Pricing & Availability

The list price for the D100 vacuum is $499.99 from [uwanthome.com](http://uwanthome.com/). It’s currently being offered for $289.99 there and $279.99 on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/47Jjmmr).

# User Experience

The UWANT D100 arrived well packaged, with all components secured in styrofoam and wrapped in plastic. Unpacking was straightforward, and I made sure all parts were included before beginning assembly. Setting up the vacuum was simple, essentially just inserting the handle into the body and positioning the charging dock against a wall near a power outlet. The vacuum had some charge out of the box, but I placed it on the charger immediately to ensure a full battery for its first use. One minor hiccup was that the instructions were a little confusing. I had to start using the vacuum to figure out how to power it on, as it requires a slight tilt first. Even with that small learning curve, it was clear from the start that the vacuum is well-built, with high-quality materials and solid construction.

I found that the UWANT D100 handles a wide variety of debris with ease. From dust and crumbs to outdoor elements like leaves and grass, the vacuum did a great job of picking it all up. In our entryway, which sees heavy foot traffic, it has been simple to run the vacuum across the tiled floor to quickly clean up tracked-in dirt. It also performs well on spills in the kitchen, effectively picking up liquids such as coffee and soda. The D100 has consistently delivered strong results.

https://preview.redd.it/bpkihn4cmdlf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=329d067478cff556c9752ddde5da15b80070e404

I thought its Intelligent Floor Sensing System did a great job since moving between our entryway into our kitchen means moving from tile to linoleum. I was able to transition between those areas without making any manual adjustments for water flow or suction. f

The D100 is exceptionally easy to control and maneuver. Being self-propelled, it often feels as if it moves on its own, reducing the effort required from the user. Its lay-flat design has allowed me to reach under furniture such as kitchen tables, tackling dust and debris in hard-to-reach spots. While I’ve had to squat to see exactly what the vacuum is cleaning, the D100 does the heavy lifting, making the process comfortable and efficient. The controls are intuitive, and the LED display clearly communicates battery life and cleaning modes, further enhancing usability.

Maintenance with the D100 is simple and convenient. The hot-air drying feature thoroughly cleans and dries the roller after use, helping to prevent lingering odors, which is something I’ve fought with wet-dry vacuums in the past. I haven’t had any issues with removing and emptying the dirty water tank, which makes it easy to prepare the vacuum for the next cleaning session.

https://preview.redd.it/fzib4skdmdlf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf1a3278ca60d03b41fac5688a80baf6c99d242c

In terms of battery life, the advertised 35-minute runtime seems to be accurate. I didn’t use a stopwatch to time the battery drain, but that seemed to be a good estimate for a vacuuming session. It allowed me to clean the two bathrooms (small footprint), the kitchen, and the entry way thoroughly. The D100 is very quiet. There is a whirring noise when the motor is on, but it’s not as loud as a standard upright vacuum. Overall, I feel that the D100 delivers strong value for the price. While there are minor quirks, the ease of maintenance, effective cleaning, and thoughtful features makes it a reliable tool for keeping hard floors clean.

# Conclusion

The UWANT D100 Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner is a thoughtfully designed solution for busy households looking to simplify hard-floor cleaning. By combining vacuuming and mopping in a single cordless device, it saves significant time and effort. Its Intelligent Floor Sensing System adjusts suction and water flow automatically, while the self-cleaning roller with hot-air drying keeps maintenance minimal. Lightweight, maneuverable, and effective on a range of surfaces, the D100 delivers a satisfying, hassle-free cleaning experience. For anyone who wants to reclaim time spent mopping and make daily floor care easier, this vacuum stands out as a solid choice.

I had coffee with a fellow business owner last week who was tearing his hair out. His 12-person team kept asking about AI, but the moment he mentioned implementing anything, they'd freeze up like deer in headlights.

Turns out, 42% of SMEs are already seeing real wins with AI – faster workflows, smarter decisions, serious cost savings. But here's the problem: most teams feel totally unprepared to use these tools effectively.

# Here's How to Bridge That Gap Fast

✅ Start With a Reality Check

Send an anonymous survey to your team rating their tech comfort 1-10. You'll probably discover your ""non-tech"" people are more ready than they think. One construction manager I trained was convinced he'd never ""get"" AI – by day two, he was using it for project scheduling and cost estimates.

✅ Focus on Immediate Pain Points

Don't start with complex automation. Pick tools that solve daily headaches right now. Email templates that adapt to customer queries. Scheduling assistants that eliminate meeting coordination hell. Data analysis that turns your messy spreadsheets into clear insights.

I worked with a retail owner who used basic AI to analyze sales patterns. Result? 15% revenue boost in three months – not from working harder, but from working smarter.

✅ Make It Hands-On, Not Theoretical

Forget PowerPoints about machine learning algorithms. Give everyone 30 minutes with a simple AI tool that directly relates to their job. Let them play, experiment, make mistakes. Learning happens when people touch the technology.

✅ Create Psychological Safety

The biggest barrier isn't technical – it's emotional. People are terrified of looking stupid or breaking something important. Set up practice environments where mistakes are encouraged, not penalized.

✅ Tie Training to Tangible Benefits

One accounting firm offered £200 bonuses for completing AI training and implementing one new tool. Not only did everyone participate – they started competing to find new applications. Track time saved too – when people see AI giving them back 2 hours per week, motivation becomes unstoppable.

# The Compound Effect

Once your team gets over the initial hump, something magical happens. They start seeing AI opportunities everywhere. The admin discovers forecasting tools. The sales manager finds better lead qualification. The marketing person creates social content in minutes, not hours.

Productivity doesn't just improve – it compounds. And that's where real competitive advantages are built.

AI isn't here to replace your team – it's here to remove the boring work so they can focus on what actually drives revenue.

What's the biggest barrier stopping your team from embracing AI tools? Fear of the tech, lack of time, or something else entirely?

By the time I got on the train I could barely keep my eyes open. The seats were way too comfortable and that was the end of me.

Next thing I know I wake up to a dark, empty train parked in some random station I’ve never even heard of. I check my phone and it’s 1:30am. Took me a full minute to realize I somehow slept through not just my stop but the last few stops until they shut the thing down for the night.

I start wandering around this half-lit station feeling like I’m in the beginning of a horror movie. Eventually I run into a security guard who looks at me and goes “you’re not the first” before letting me out. Which was great except now I’m two hours from home, no trains running, and the only Uber option I had was almost $200.

I ended up walking to the only diner that was still open and just sat there drinking coffee until 5am when the first train finally came. The waitress felt bad and gave me free refills so at least someone was on my side.

I literally just got out of my therapist appointment and the first thing that happens is this.

My mom and me arrive back home, and my dad is having coffee in the table. My mom kind of has a sour expression on his face and I think this is one of the things that set him off.
He started saying that he thinks the reason I was diagnosed with depression is because of my vitamin D deficiency. Which I think can cause a lot of similar symptoms. 

I added that I felt there were more things causing my depression than just a vitamin D deficiency. Especially because I had felt that way since before I had the deficiency. 

He immediately got angry and started telling me and my mom that he knew what he was talking about. He has a degree in biology and immediately started saying that he’s basically smarter. He also said that he was shocked we didn’t believe what he was saying. We never said that…

He’s been acting like this the entire week. I know it bothers him that we don’t always agree with him, but the fact that he starts yelling and gets defensive immediately is insane. 

For example: He always feels the need to comment on everyone’s body weight. Yesterday, I told him I didn’t want to talk about body weight, (especially because it’s making my mom feel terrible about herself) and he immediately got angry. He he told me that it was just trivial and adult conversation and I was being very rude towards him. 

It’s really hard to talk to him sometimes, because he is a huge pessimist. When I tell him I want to talk about other things, I also do it to get him to stop thinking negative things all the time. But he genuinely thinks that we just hate him and everything he ever wants to talk about. 

It’s really hard on my mom and I don’t know what to do.

(PS: I am very involved in his interests. I listen to his music and watch his favorite movies and tv shows)

Kevin Smith is giving fans of his 1995 movie Mallrats a sequel, of sorts, in a tribute to late star Shannen Doherty. 

On Wednesday, Aug. 20, Smith, 55, shared an Instagram post with illustrator Ryan Gajda that revealed a cover for Smith's Quick Stops Vol. 3 — meant to resemble Doherty and Jason Lee’s characters from Smith’s cult classic — as they announced the comic book will release Sept. 24.

“I've been excited about mentioning this for a while... but earlier this year I drew a whole comic written by @thatkevinsmith for his Quick Stops series with @darkhorsecomics and it's out next month on Sept 24th,” Gajda wrote in the caption. 

“The story is a tribute to the incomparable Shannen Doherty and a continuation of the story of Mallrats based on Kevin Smith's sequel script that would have checked in on Brodie and Rene 30 years on from the events of the original,” the illustrator added.

“When I was fifteen I drank a bunch of coffee and stayed up especially late one night with my brother to watch Mallrats on BBC2 after seeing Dogma and falling in love with it. If you'd told me then that I'd be doing this now I think my brain would have exploded.”

Doherty, who died at age 53 in July 2024, starred in Mallrats opposite Lee and Jeremy London. The movie follows a number of characters who converge at a local mall in New Jersey, where many of Smith’s movies are set. Smith and his frequent costar Jason Mewes appear in the movie as Jay and Silent Bob, and the film primarily follows a relationship between Doherty and Lee’s characters.

As illustrator Gajda mentioned in his Instagram post, Smith once wrote a sequel to the movie titled Twilight of the Mallrats. After Doherty’s death last year, Smith told PEOPLE in an interview at San Diego Comic-Con that Doherty said she ""really wanted to do"" the sequel in some of their final conversations.

""At the very least, as a 'for Shannen,’ that'd be a cool thing to do,"" Smith said at that time.

Penguin Random House, which publishes Smith's Quick Stops comic book series, wrote in an official description of the new volume that Smith ""honors his friend and costar Shannen Doherty with two stories"" in the new book, ""one about Shannen’s immaculate sense of humor, and the other a requiem for her character in Mallrats, Rene."" The new edition also features stories related to Smith's movies Chasing Amy and Dogma.  

Smith’s new comic sequel to Mallrats is available for purchase Sept. 24.

1n0nhmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1n0nhmr/i_need_urgent_advice_abusive_mother_paralyzed/,"I need urgent advice: abusive mother, paralyzed father, and my only escape is to leave Peru for university before it’s too late.","Hi everyone, I (18F) live in Peru and I’ve been abused by my mother for as long as I can remember. Since I was 7, she has attacked me every single day, called me horrible names, and blamed me for everything that goes wrong in her life. I grew up being told I was “ungrateful,” “worthless,” “a disappointment,” “a parasite.” Nothing I do is ever good enough for her. If I succeed, she says it doesn’t count because I didn’t suffer enough. If I fail, she says it proves I’ll never be anything. Both me and my father (non biological) are victims of every form of abuse and coercion from her, we live permanently threatened by her.   
  
My father is completely controlled by her. She doesn’t let him see his own family, forces him to cook and drive her around, and keep her financially stable, as she is not working and has no intention to do so. He agrees with me in private, but when she screams, he sides with her out of fear. He keeps telling me: “There’s nothing we can do, she’ll ruin our lives if we fight her.” Meanwhile, she treats my younger brother like he’s a saint. She celebrates his smallest achievements, never lays a hand on him, and gives him all her affection. I’ve been the scapegoat my entire life.

She has been physically violent my whole life. She slaps me, hits me  constantly, and has made me bleed multiple times. Two days ago, she threw a cup of hot coffee (among other things) at me during an argument. When I didn’t apologize to her afterwards, she tried to kick me out of the house. I left in tears, but she immediately weaponized the entire family against me, telling my sick grandmother (who is on chemotherapy) that I was “abandoning” her, and sending my uncle to mock me, saying “if you were really abused, you’d be covered in bruises.” That destroyed me. My father was threatened that if I didn’t come back, he would also be thrown out. Out of fear, I returned home.

Coming back didn’t mean safety. Now she’s forcing all of us to move into one small room in my grandmother’s house, in a poor neighborhood far away from my university. That house is filled with her family , her support network, the people she runs to whenever she wants to twist the story and paint herself as the victim. I only agreed to return because both my grandmother and my father promised me they would support me in finally leaving the country and escaping her.

 I have everything I need to succeed abroad: strong grades, extracurricular activities, prizes, certificates, and a high enough IB score to get into a well-ranked university. But my mother refuses to pay a cent unless it’s for a scholarship, because in her words, anything else would mean giving in to a “mediocre and ungrateful” daughter. Even though she has the money, she would rather use it to keep me trapped.  
  
My father is completely paralyzed by her. He refuses to meet with the admissions center unless my mother is involved, because in his words “we can’t do anything behind her back.” I’ve suggested divorce so he can use his financial freedom to support me (because currently my mother has taken away his credit and debit cards), but he says it’s impossible because she still has control over my younger brother, and he’s terrified of what she would do. His “solution” is to bring her into the conversation , but I know exactly how that will play out. She’ll either invent impossible conditions, make everything harder, or flat-out say no. The truth is, she doesn’t want to let me go, and she will never agree to put a single dollar into me if it means losing control.

That’s where things get terrifying. I’m running out of time before my IB becomes invalid, and I feel like the only way to move anything forward is to do something extreme, to blow up the situation so badly that my father has no choice but to finally step up for me after years of living in fear and conformity. Staying in Peru isn’t an option: if I try to live on my own, she will make a public scene, drag me back, and the law here won’t protect me. She’s volatile, unstable, and capable of hurting herself or someone else, and that’s exactly why my father refuses to act. But if nothing changes, I lose my only chance to ever escape her.

But the truth is: I can’t live like this anymore. I’m 18, legally an adult, but still financially dependent. The only possible escape I have is leaving the country to study. I’ve worked incredibly hard, I'm gifted (that is why she is never content with anything I do, because in her eyes, I'm lazy and never willing to put effort), I have the academic background, and I have family abroad who would take me in. But time is running out, If I don’t use it now, I lose the one shot I’ve spent years preparing for.

I’m scared. I want to live, I want to get out, I want to finally be free of her control. But I don’t know how to make this happen before it’s too late.

Please, if anyone has advice, I desperately need it. Even if it’s just one suggestion, or if anyone knows what I can do legally in Peru to protect myself until I’m able to leave. I do have possible support networks abroad, family in California who would gladly take me in, and close friends in Spain and Italy who could help me if I manage to transfer universities there. But I feel stuck between time running out, my mother’s control, and my father’s fear. My mother has caused me a chronic illness, she has clouded my judgment, and I feel terrified all the time. At this point, even if you have advice that isn’t strictly ethical, please feel free to share it. This is my last option before I completely give up, because living under her has become unbearable.

Like, how can something make you feel thrilled one moment… and suspicious the next?  

On the one hand, they scream freedom. A little rectangular ticket into possibility. On the other hand, are they secretly just saying: “I didn’t know what you like, so here’s… an assignment”?  

- They’re convenient. Easy to buy, easy to use, no weird sizes or mismatched colors to worry about.  
- They can feel thoughtless. It’s literally the modern version of handing someone cash but dressing it up in a shiny wrapper.  
- They excite. Because even if people complain about them, you *know* you’re gonna spend it, and you *know* you’ll like what you got.  

And then there’s this other layer: isn’t it wild how we treat them differently based on where the gift card is from? A card from a luxury boutique feels like getting edged toward indulgence. But a card from the coffee chain you go to every single morning? That’s almost intimate—it says: “I see you ordering your overpriced latte at 8AM like clockwork.”  

### Here’s where my brain gets messy with it:  
Why do I sometimes roll my eyes when I receive one, but when I have to give a gift last-minute, they suddenly look divine, shimmering, wrapped in golden redemption?  

Go figure.  

Also… how come nobody talks about the unspoken dread of card limits: like when the thing has an awkward remaining balance of $3.47 left. Are you supposed to save it? Pull out exact change? Frame it as modern art? 

And maybe the real kicker is this: sometimes a gift card works as the perfect placeholder for something bigger. Think of it as saying: “Here’s a starter. Get what you *really* want.” Almost like a bridge into personal choice—but with the wrapper of luxury intact.  

- They’re half surprise, half homework.  
- They’re loved, they’re hated, yet nobody returns them.  
- They’re unavoidable.  

Still, whenever I give one, I try to tuck it inside something personal. A small handwritten line. A miniature creative object. Or even a recommendation—like sharing a link that makes the moment feel special. Which is what I’ll drop here too: https://goodnovel.org/  

Because what if the upgrade to a gift card is pairing it with a world of experiences—something they can choose for themselves, but also something you hinted toward? Like blending their freedom with your thoughtfulness.  

Sometimes people want sparkle, sometimes surprise, sometimes both.  
Sometimes a gift card *is* the answer, sometimes it’s not.  
Sometimes we overthink, sometimes they just want coffee.  

If nothing else, gift cards remind me that gifts aren’t always about the thing—it’s about how much of *you* you actually put in.  

And maybe next time, I’ll remember that a card isn’t the absence of effort… it’s just another doorway.  

https://goodnovel.org/  

So now I’m just curious—does anyone here feel like gift cards *count* as luxury when paired thoughtfully, or do you all see them as a backup plan?

I was at 500lbs at  my heaviest and I'm 6'6, I either disgusted or terrified people. I lost the weight and gained muscle a few years ago but feels like I did it too late. The damage of decades of rejection have taken their toll and women just aren't as outgoing or social as they used to be in their youth.

  
The rejections now are 'better' but they are still rejections and at this point, I'm so far behind that it feels like I'll never catch up.



If I had one date in my life, I'd probably feel differently but as it stands, going decades with nothing but rejection is painting me with toxic mindsets. I'm tired of fighting it, why should I repress how I feel to make someone else who doesn't care about me feel better?

Outside of 1 bad experience when I was younger (and before anyone jumps to conclusions, she gave me a rejection that hurt my soul and made me question my worth as a man, so it was justified), I don't blow up when I get rejected, regardless how I feel but I'm starting to wonder what's the point? Why am I feigning optimism when I get yet another rejection? I'm so tired of feeling like this, of feeling like being a dreg to society for wanting the same basic human companionship that everyone else had in their teens and take for granted.",2,1756218357.0,AskForAnswers,6,1.0,False

This morning I have my normal breakfast. Two pieces of Old Tyme bread with some peanut butter, a cup of light yogurt, coffee, and a protein shake. About 650 calories with 98g or protein and 18g of fiber.

I eat this breakfast almost everyday and can usually eat a protein bar or something else right after.

This time I felt like I was struggling to get through my protein shake, and now I feel almost nauseously full.

Opening Scene – Ally’s Apartment
Ally (mid-50s, still stylishly quirky) is humming while making tea.
Fantasy sequence: she imagines herself in a courtroom, slamming down a gavel as the “Judge of Love.” Larry’s image flickers in front of her—she bangs the gavel harder until the tea kettle whistles, snapping her back.
Ally (to herself):
“Don’t even think about him. Past tense. Very past tense.”
Scene 2 – Cage, Fish & Associates (Firm Lobby)
Richard Fish (still the same, older but none the wiser) is talking about “face bra lifts” to a young associate.
The doors open—Larry Paul walks in. He looks older, softer, but determined.
Richard nearly spits out his coffee.
Richard:
“Well, if it isn’t Frosty the No-Show. What brings you crawling back from Canada, eh?”
Larry (calmly):
“Looking for Ally.”
Richard warns him Ally may not welcome him.
Scene 3 – Ally’s Office
Ally is at her desk when Larry appears at her door. Silence.
Music cue: “Both Sides Now” plays faintly in Ally’s imagination.
She blinks, imagining herself literally shrinking into her chair like a child trying to hide.
Ally (coldly):
“You have some nerve.”
Larry:
“I know. But I had to see you.”
Ally keeps her walls up.
Ally:
“Go back to Canada, Larry. Whatever you’re looking for—it’s not here anymore.”
He tries to explain his son is grown, that he never stopped thinking about her.
Ally cuts him off, walks out, leaving him in her office alone.
Scene 4 – Ally at Home (Night)
Maddie (grown, mid-20s) visits. They eat takeout on the couch.
Ally is restless. Maddie notices.
Maddie:
“Mom… you saw him, didn’t you?”
Ally (defensive):
“No. Yes. Maybe. Why should I tell you?!”
Maddie (softly):
“Because you’re still angry. People don’t get angry over nothing. They get angry when they still care.”
Ally pretends not to listen but is clearly shaken.
Scene 5 – Larry Alone
Larry is in his hotel room, looking at an old photo of him and Ally from years ago.
He whispers to himself:
Larry:
“Not giving up. Not again.”
Fantasy Closing Scene – Ally’s Dream
Ally dreams she’s in a wedding dress, walking down the aisle. The groom’s face flickers between Larry and a faceless shadow.
Just as she’s about to lift the veil, she wakes up in a sweat.
Ally (to herself):
“Damn you, Larry Paul.”

1n0n71b,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1n0n71b/the_train_ride_that_changed_everything/,The train ride that changed everything,"A few years ago, I was commuting to work every morning on the same crowded train. Same people, same tired faces, same endless scrolling on phones. It was routine, boring, forgettable.

One morning, the train was packed and I had to stand. At the next stop, a woman got on and ended up squeezed right next to me. She was holding a coffee cup and a book, trying desperately not to spill either while the train lurched forward. Without thinking, I offered to hold her coffee so she could grab the railing. She laughed, handed it over, and said, “If you run off with that, I hope you like your lattes sweet.”

That was the beginning.

Every morning after that, we somehow ended up on the same train car. At first it was just polite smiles. Then small talk. Then full conversations that made the train ride feel way too short. She started saving me a seat when she got there before me, and I started grabbing her favorite croissant from the bakery by my apartment.

Months went by, and one rainy morning, she sighed and said, “It’s crazy how this awful commute is now my favorite part of the day.” I laughed and admitted, “Me too.” Then the train jolted to a stop, and in that awkward, cinematic way, she stumbled right into me. We both froze, way too close, until she finally whispered, “So… are you going to kiss me, or should I miss my stop?”

Reader, I kissed her. She *did* miss her stop that day. And the next day, she didn’t bother saving me a seat because she was already sitting next to me, holding my hand.

That was three years ago. We don’t take the train anymore we moved in together. But sometimes, when we’re walking to the bakery, she still teases me: “You’re lucky I trusted you with my coffee.”",2,1756218115.0,story,0,0.75,False

1n0n4ga,https://i.redd.it/4on272rmhdlf1.jpeg,OThe Dark Side of Balinese Luwak Coffee: What Tourists Don't Know (Or Choose to Ignore),"Just got back from Bali, and everywhere you go—on every other street, at plantations, in souvenir shops—you're aggressively marketed the ""world's most expensive coffee,"" Kopi Luwak.

For the uninitiated: Kopi Luwak is coffee made from beans that have been eaten by an Asian palm civet, passed through its digestive tract, and then... um... ""naturally collected"" from its feces. Enzymes in the animal's stomach supposedly break down proteins in the beans, giving the coffee a unique smoothness and lack of bitterness.

Sounds wild and exotic, right? That's exactly the hook all the tourist spots use. Spoiler alert: I didn't try it. And here's why.

1. Industry Cruelty. 
The original concept was that farmers collected beans from the droppings of wild civets in the jungle. It was a rare, accidental product. Now, demand is so huge that 99% of all Luwak coffee is produced on factory-farm cages. Civets are kept in tiny, cramped cages and force-fed an unnatural diet of almost only coffee berries (their natural diet is omnivorous—they eat insects, fruit, etc.). This leads to disease, severe stress, and early death. Look it up on YouTube; it's heart-wrenching.

2. Low Quality & Scams. 
What's in your cup is almost certainly not the unique coffee you're imagining. Often:
   · Beans from sick, stressed-out animals are blended with regular ones.
   · It's a mass-produced, low-quality product. Producers care about the ""Luwak"" brand, not the actual flavor profile.
   · You're paying a huge premium (a cup can be $5-10, a kilogram can be hundreds of dollars) for a myth and cruelty.

3. There are amazing alternatives! 
Coffee in Bali and Indonesia in general is fantastic! Try traditional Bali Kintamani (grown in volcanic soil, with a bright citrusy note) or the legendary Sumatra Mandheling. These are incredible single-origin beans that don't require any animal suffering.

The bottom line: 
Balinese Luwak coffee is, in most cases, not an exclusive gastronomic experience but an ethical tourist trap. We all love coffee and adventure, but let's make an informed choice.

So, have you tried it? What were your impressions? Or did you also refuse based on ethical concerns?

If you need a more physical relationship, I’m not the right person for you. Let’s be respectful :)

**Who I’m looking for:**

* someone who’s around my age, so 25-30
* located somewhere in Europe
* since I’m ace, someone with a very low drive, or maybe you’re ace too
* someone who wants to eventually settle down, but doesn’t want kids
* emotional intelligence, honesty, reliability and stability are desired

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person with liberal views (leftie, feminist, pro-choice, ally…)
* childfree
* chubby and short (160cm), some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* short dark brown hair (but I change it up, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* don’t smoke or drink at all
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* also enjoy a quiet evening at home
* into fashion, photography, k-pop, anime, writing, reading, traveling
* sports or gaming are not really my thing lol
* dog person but sadly allergic :(

**Dealbreakers**/ **Big** **NOs for me:**

* far right ideology/views
* racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* severe mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries other people’s troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

**NOTE:** Please do not message me saying “you just haven’t met the right person” or thinking you can change or “fix” me. I’m not ill, I’m not broken, I’m not faulty. I was born this way and I’m happy. Go find a partner that meets your needs and stop trying to change others.",2,1756217842.0,r4r,1,0.55,False

We’re a couple, who recently moved to Sweden. We love meeting new people and trying out new things together. Our interests include video games, board games (from classics to more complex ones), music, and just wandering around the city.

We’d be happy to meet for a coffee, a beer, some gaming nights, or just a walk. We speak English, and we’re also learning Swedish. We’re also pretty open-minded and curious about different kinds of connections, so if you’re looking for more than just casual friendship, that could be fun too :)",1,1756217756.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
