I pray to God that you would start seeing your downfall soon,"I usually order a pico sized cappuccino, and I used to get a good amount of coffee. But today I only got two sips of coffee in this cup. I am so fucking furious right now because I paid 250 rupees for two sips. I am already having the worst day, and on top of all the problems I have, I get one disappointing, shitty cold coffee. I am just tired of living in a hostel and relying on these shit coffees. One thing I’ve noticed is that I get good coffee during non-peak hours, but during peak hours they just fuck it up.",1,1765808196.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

Should the pile filling go in the center layer of the cake or be dispersed throughout? 

Will adding all this extra moisture effect the cakes ability to rise and can I combat that?

I'm thinking of making some kind of sticky glaze or caramel to drizzle lightly on the top.

1pn8cmw,https://i.redd.it/ga4y7qcpld7g1.png,Turning common coffee mistakes into a simple tool,"Over the past year I’ve been diving into what really causes bad coffee at home. There are tons of “mistakes” people post about wrong temp, grind size, ratios, technique and they sound different but often stem from a few recurring habits. 

That got me thinking: what if instead of guessing what went wrong, you could answer a few simple questions about how you brew and get back what likely mistake is affecting your cup?

So I started building a little tool that does exactly that based on real community discussions and common mistakes people make, not marketing hype. It’s meant to help people figure out whether they’re actually dealing with:

technique issues

gear mismatches

or just bad habits that most beginners overlook


It’s completely free, doesn’t track you or require email, and the whole point is to help people avoid wasting cash on gear they don’t need. 

Before I polish it up and officially publish it, I’d love to hear from here in this sub specifically what are the most common mistakes you see around here?

For example:

water temp issues

skipping bloom

press speed

grind inconsistency

anything else?


I’m trying to make the tool actually useful for real needs, not just theory.

1pn8ciy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn8ciy,Coffee vs dark chocolate: what changed in my brain scans,"Hey everyone! Someone here asked if I could test dark chocolate vs coffee, so I did and wanted to share the results.

dark chocolate gets mentioned a lot as a gentler stimulant because of theobromine (plus a bit of caffeine). The idea is that it might improve alertness or mood without the jitter or overactivation.

**My setup**

* Baseline brain scan
* 30-40g of 85% dark chocolate
* Waited around 50 minutes
* Second scan

**Dark chocolate: before vs after**

Baseline (before chocolate):

* High beta and beta elevated, even with eyes closed (persistent vigilance)
* Alpha low overall, with very weak alpha response (1–3%), meaning my brain doesn’t easily settle into a true resting state
* Theta drops with eyes open (focused), then drifts a bit when trying to rest
* Fatigue index relatively high

In short: sharp and functional, but not great at switching into rest mode.

**After dark chocolate:**

* High beta and beta stayed elevated (no calming effect)
* Alpha stayed low, alpha response barely changed (around 1–2%). technically, it increased but remained very low.
* Theta and delta showed some normalization with eyes closed, but without a clear shift toward a calmer or more relaxed state
* Fatigue index dropped (about 2.2 to 1.9)
* Mental strain increased a bit
* Engagement stayed high but felt less effortful

my interpretation: in my case, dark chocolate added stimulation without improving the brain’s ability to settle. The maps looked more amped rather than more organized.

**How this compares to coffee**

For context, here’s what coffee did for me in an earlier test, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1p24zeh/my_brain_before_and_after_coffee/) are the scans:

**Before coffee:**

* High beta elevated and somewhat scattered
* Alpha response very low (3%)
* Mental strain: 0.59
* Engagement high but not very stable

**After coffee ( around 40 min):**

* High beta didn’t increase; it became more organized, especially frontally
* Beta looked more coherent instead of noisy
* Alpha response jumped from 3% to 10%
* Mental strain dropped slightly (0.59 to 0.53)
* Engagement stayed about the same
* Fatigue index increased a bit (1.97 to 2.12), which makes sense after stimulation

**my interpretation:** Coffee seemed to improve organization and state-shifting, while dark chocolate increased arousal without that regulatory effect.

Disclaimer: I work at Myndlift. I’m sharing this because the before/after patterns were genuinely interesting to me. This is a single-person experiment, not medical advice, and results will vary between people. If you have ideas for other conditions I should test, I’m happy to run more and share the data",1,1765807979.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False
1pn8bhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1pn8bhf/on_politics_as_a_comedy_for_the_misinformed/,"On Politics, As A Comedy, For the Misinformed","Between bombings, they read the funny stories. Of course, the funny stories are about them. The funniest jokes, it is said in the trenches and bombed out sheds, are always about themselves. Someone has written a bad one about a dancer, or a stage, the meaning is so muddled you puzzle over it in an early morning huddle, breath fogging, till the coffee cups are empty and the cigarettes are stubs.

The sun as it breaks the damaged horizon shines hard, throws long and lethal glints over mile upon mile of cable. Cable in the trees children used to play beneath, cable on the road that would take you to your parents house, cable on the river your uncle used to fish. The cables are the world sliced into grids, mechanically sectioned, cut into digestible squares.

War makes the world odd. Misshapen. Men and women disappear under their metal visors to become all-seeing oracles, hunting through metal insects that can kill. Untouched mailboxes stand guard at lifeless craters where there were once homes, familiar faces. The men that had friends or family there pat them as they pass, unwilling to break the bad news or acknowledge the tragedy.

On the long walk up and down the Line you think about the dancer. Or was it a stage? It seems less funny now, further away. It prickles in your mind the way a landmine does to those with sensitive, knowing feet. A trap, barbed and primed, laid for the uncertain and the foolish. Someone is dancing. Of that you are certain. But, as the sun rises over a city made lifeless and nameless, caught in killer cable like an animal— you are certain it is not you.",1,1765807905.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

I put together a simple free tool for a quick way to see which brands are currently doing creator collaborations.

It updates multiple times a day now and you can filter by:

* Brand
* Creator
* Sub-niche
* Platform (both IG and tiktok now)

I’ve spent the last few weeks making some major updates to the database, so I wanted to share the new version.

What’s new:

* More Data: Now tracking 2,600+ active creators and 1,700+ brands (both TikTok & Instagram) and over 3000 collabs
* engagement rates
* Captions
* Creator profiles 
* saving creators to favorites

The live feed is still completely free to browse without a login. 

I added a simple sign-in *only* if you want to use creator profiles or save favorites. CSV exports with business contact details of creators are optional and paid, everything else is free.

1pn88he,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1pn88he/alex_coopers_unwell_beverages_launches_unwell/,"Alex Cooper’s Unwell Beverages Launches Unwell Energy, Expanding Into the Energy Drink Category","Alex Cooper’s Unwell brand is officially moving beyond hydration and protein with the launch of Unwell Energy, marking a new phase for the platform now known as Unwell Beverages. Originally launched as Unwell Hydration, the brand has steadily expanded into electrolyte mixes and protein products, and now enters the crowded energy drink space with a women-first, better-for-you positioning.

Unwell Energy is designed to balance taste and function, leaning into clean ingredients, moderate caffeine, and electrolytes — while staying aligned with the brand’s broader message of rejecting “perfect” wellness culture in favor of something more realistic and accessible.

The product launches nationwide at Target on December 28, signaling a strong retail push out of the gate.

Key Details:

* Brand evolution: Unwell Hydration → Unwell Beverages
* New product: Unwell Energy
* Flavors: Cherry Lime, Passion Fruit Orange Guava, Watermelon, Pineapple Coconut
* Functional profile per can:
   * 150 mg natural caffeine from green coffee extract
   * 745 mg electrolytes
   * 6 essential B vitamins, including biotin
   * 3g sugar, sweetened with stevia
* Made with real fruit juice and no artificial sweeteners
* National launch at Target stores and [Target.com](http://Target.com) on Dec. 28
* Six-month brand campaign: Unwell Forever, rolling out across Instagram and TikTok

Why this matters:

Unwell’s move into energy follows the broader trend of creator-led brands expanding into high-velocity beverage categories — but energy is crowded, expensive, and unforgiving. Distribution at Target gives Unwell a meaningful shot, but long-term success will hinge on repeat purchase, not audience size.

Do creator-founded brands have enough staying power to win in energy, or does the category now demand legacy-scale execution to survive?

Someone mentioned in comments that GCGC is the reason GPGP wouldn't get chapter updates and that GCGC is more successful.

I've tried playing today, I don't vibe with it, but I kinda see why someone could like GCGC more. Throwing out and serving things is easier (I wished I could throw pizzas in the bottom of the screen), the game looks more pinkish/cute, there are more customer variations, plus daily energy, so the game seems similar to other mobile games with that mechanic. 

And I guess multiple coffee every day seems more realistic than pizzas. I kinda though that buying pizza everyday is a running gag, yet in comparison GCGC now seems more realistic and relatable, like nothing crazy happening.

I made an double espresso and after some time there was only a little sip left. When she wanted to add milk, I took the espresso and said I didn’t think it made sense, because that much milk overpowers the taste of an espresso and feels like a waste of good coffee.

I know she wouldn’t enjoy it anyway, since the taste of the espresso would be completely lost in that amount of milk, I suggested a few alternatives. I said she could drink it black, I could drink the espresso myself and make her a fresh coffee that actually works better with milk, or she could just have milk if that’s what she was in the mood for. From my perspective, this wasn’t meant to be controlling, but rather an expression of how I personally value coffee and my reluctance to see it used in a way that, to me, didn’t make sense.

She didn’t want a new coffee and just wanted to drink the little sip of espresso with milk. After some discussion, she told me madly that I can just drink her espresso. She said she felt disrespected and said I crossed a line by trying to dictate how she drinks her coffee.

Now we disagree on whether I was being unreasonable or whether this was just poor communication over a minor issue.

On paper it sounds incredibly convenient but I am not sure if they are actually worth it compared to using loose grounds and a resusable filter.   
  
The biggest appeal for me is the lack of mess, no measuring, no straining and no dealing with soggly grounds afterwaqrds. Just pull the pack out and you are done, I am wondering if you lose anything in terms of flavor control. With loose coffee you can adjust grind size, bean origin and rations pretty easily.   
  
With filter pack you are locked into whatever grind and blend manufacturer chooses. I think it might come out more expensive though so not sure if it is worth the added costgs, I know that buying beans in bulk like from a site like Alibaba will come out cheaper compared to using prepackaged sachets, but just wanted to find out if it is better to use the prepackaged ones. I am thinking if they are more effective then this it could be worth it. I am also curious about how strong the coffee is, will it  be weaker then using fresh grounds?

I’ve had so many fillings, cavities, crowns, root canals - I’ve spent thousands trying to “fix” them and they’re STILL bad. At the moment I can't chew on either side because on one side, I have a filling that after 2 times being done it started hurting again. Other side I have a tooth that's between crown appointments so it's drilled to it's last bit.

The thing that drives me insane is that I actually take care of my teeth. 

I brush twice a day (Electric tooth brush that I change the head on every month)
floss, use mouthwash (between brushing, never immediately, just during the day) don’t eat that much sugar, don’t live off fizzy drinks or sweets. I don't smoke. Have 2 coffees a day. Drink maybe biweekly? Not every week for sure.

Meanwhile my partner:

Eats loads of sweets

Drinks energy drinks

Has 3+ coffees and teas a day

Rarely brushes his teeth

And his teeth are completely fine. No pain, no cavities, no expensive dental work. Better teeth than mine by a mile.

I’m so sick of people acting like bad teeth automatically mean you’re lazy or unhygienic. It feels like I lost the genetic lottery and now I’m paying for it over and over again. Once you’ve had fillings/root canals, it just snowballs, things fail, new problems pop up, more money gone.

It’s exhausting, embarrassing, and honestly unfair. I do “everything right” and still get punished, while other people abuse their teeth and somehow get away with it.

1pn7xox,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn7xox,Got offered a $214k diamond Royal Oak at my first AP visit - is this normal?,"So I visited an AP boutique in New York recently and had an interesting experience that I wanted to get the community’s perspective on.

I walked in wearing my rose gold Daytona on Oysterflex and met with a sales associate who was incredibly welcoming. We sat down and I explained my interest in AP, how my entire collection is currently Rolex, Panerai & gshock pieces that I’ve gotten at retail, and how I don’t buy gray market. She was curious about my Daytona and how I got allocated for it, so I walked her through my history and purchase journey with Rolex.

She explained AP’s approach which is no waitlist, just a “journey” where you typically start with certain models. I told her I was looking for stainless steel, something I could wear daily, as I wanted to diversify beyond Rolex. She brought out several pieces: Code 11.59s, Offshores, white dial Royal Oak chronos, regular Royal Oaks - basically my whole wish list. She mentioned that some of the pieces I was interested in would be hard to get as a first purchase, and that I’d likely need to start with an Offshore or Code 11.59.

The whole experience was top-tier - she asked about my hobbies, interests, what I do in my spare time. They brought me coffee, the service was impeccable. We talked about AP’s events and artist collaborations. She even showed me a Concept watch the kaws collaboration that was over $200k.

As we’re wrapping up, she says she has “something special” for me. Goes to the back and brings out a Royal Oak Jumbo Extra Thin (Ref. 16202BC.ZZ.1241BC.01) - completely iced out with diamonds. Offers it to me for $214k before tax.

Beautiful piece, but I was looking for a stainless steel daily driver, not a fully diamond-set watch. It actually took them a while to even figure out the exact pricing since it was under a certain threshold.

My question: Is this normal? Do they typically offer heavily diamond-set pieces to first-time customers? I’m genuinely curious if this is standard AP strategy, or if there’s something else at play here.

My friends said maybe it was the Color of my skin haha but idk. Unfortunately I turned down the offer. Would love to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences at AP boutiques.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ",13,1765806920.0,audemarspiguet,14,0.93,False

down which kind youd need acc to your reqs:

pod machines or fully automatic: quick cup so for people who dont have the time or mood

compact [semi automatic machines](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO1374):
for cafe types coffee. You get to control the basics (pulling shots, steaming milk) so you can
tweak stuff according to your taste. This i think is sorta the middle ground.

larger semi automatic or prosumer machines: with these you get to be specific with every
detail(dialing in shots, grind size n consistency) but again that can get too much if you dont have
the time. 

fully automatic bean to cup machines: these honestly arent that bad taste wise and super
cheap.

I love to enjoy a good espresso doppio, but never took the step to make it at home by myself.

I used to brew my coffee in a Bialetti with fresh beans (Kingrinder K6). After much research one year ago, I invested in a Moccamaster. I didn't do the step towards an espresso machine, as I was a bit overwhelmed by all input an was not sure if I wanted to invest as much time to be able to brew a good espresso. 

Now for mz home office I want to take the chance to start my espresso journey. At first I want to keep my Kingrinder as I only will consume around 2-3 cups a day.
The right machine for the start is my biggest question mark.

Should it be a DeLonghi dedica, which requires a new basket and temperature surfing but is able to create good results, or a Bambino I repeatedly read of here? Shall I start directly with a more expensive machine with PID like the LELIT Victoria, or some thermoblovk like a quickmill? Is a gaggia enough without its gaggimate adaptions, or...

But I’m in DESPERATE need of a Jack Frost or icy king story before Christmas season closes. There’s one Jack Frost story I read on Wattpad years ago, but I don’t have it in me to try to hunt it down. 

I remember the FMC owned a coffee shop, I really want to say her name was Summer, and the spice was decent? I just know it gave me the feeling I’m trying to achieve right now. 

I’m not picky at all when it comes to the books I read, as long as I’m having fun with it I’ll most likely finish it.  I just need a MMC with ice running through his veins, and the only one who can melt his ice heart is the FMC. I usually like a lot of spice, but if the story is good I’m fine without it.

I recently moved teams (and technically businesses but I’m in the same office and I worked with a lot of my new colleagues before joining the team) and in those two months I have attended six work drinks (pub after company away day, pub after a training session, paid for thank you dinner (with my old team), two leaving drinks and the Christmas party). All of these have cost me no more than any drinks I’ve chosen to buy (so nothing, because I also don’t drink, pub is a very cheap social event for me). Pretty much all of these were wider company events so lots of people were invited. 

However, our team also has a history of organising team social events, for just the 7-10 of us but those we have to pay for and I just don’t understand why we are doing this. We are quite a young team, most people in their twenties, I’m 30, and managers are in their early 30s, and we all almost always go to general work events. So it’s not like the team isn’t at work socials. But they also try to organise team events a few times a year just for us that’s like, going bowling, and we’d have to pay £20 each, or go to a comedy club (£20 each), darts (£15 each), crazy golf (£20 each) and I don’t understand why they’re trying to organise properly after work events that I have to pay for to attend, regardless of my choice to drink. Is this common? Again, I’d just rather they organised more going to the pub, or something during work like a coffee break where someone brings in a cake. I think having to pay for work organised fun is crazy. Am I just being cheap?",2,1765806458.0,jobs,3,1.0,False

1pn7obm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1pn7obm/my_last_post_on_top_meta_advertisers_got_a_lot_of/,My last post on top Meta advertisers got a lot of good feedback. Here are 9 eCom brands that started as dropshippers and are now scaling hard — spending €100K+/month on EU Meta ads (and what’s working for them),"My last post about top performance marketing brands got some attention, so I thought I'd make a follow-up.

This time I'm focusing on brands actually spending hundreds of thousands on the EU/UK market specifically. These are the brands with massive active ad counts in Europe. Most of them have way more ads running outside the EU, which means they're operating at an even higher scale worldwide.

After receiving feedback that some of the brands were ""branding"" plays, I decided to focus 100% on performance brands. These are performance-focused DTC and app brands optimizing for ROAS, testing creative strategies weekly, and scaling what works.

Here are 9 brands crushing it in EU/UK (and also WW) right now:

# 1. Loop (14,022 active ads)

Premium earplugs that turned a commodity product into a fashion accessory.

They're running ads in 11 different languages with 182M+ total EU reach. Their localization game is unmatched — same winning concepts adapted for every major market. They let winners run for 200+ days while constantly testing new angles.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1225102349320243) – Launched 222 days ago, live. 8.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 \~€107K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/1275477364246325) – Launched 126 days ago, live. 4.4M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 \~€53K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/2015663765868742) – Launched 88 days ago, live. 4.1M EU reach, 3x creative (💰💰 \~€49K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 114 ads):**

    This discount won't wait forever.

Simple urgency. They also crush it with ADHD-focused messaging (""People with ADHD are not just lazy and unmotivated"") and gifting angles.

# 2. The Ridge (1,276 active ads)

Wallet and accessories brand that made wallets cool again with premium materials and smart features.

They focus on English-only content for US/UK markets but dominate with product-led storytelling. Their Kintsugi collection ran for 258 days with 4.3M reach — they find winners and let them run.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/960331649418900) – Launched 258 days ago. 4.3M EU reach (💰💰 \~€52K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/734512885752065) – Launched 158 days ago. 1.5M EU reach (💰 \~€18K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1531497301214409) – Launched 39 days ago, live. 1.4M EU reach (💰 \~€17K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 10 ads):**

    Your wallet sucks. That's why we invented the Ridge Wallet.

Direct, provocative, and positions them as the solution. They also dominate wedding ring content with hooks like ""Men's wedding rings suck, so we created something better.""

# 3. HexClad (843 active ads)

Gordon Ramsay-backed cookware brand that's mastered the ""lifetime warranty"" angle.

They run a mix of celebrity endorsement (Gordon), UGC testimonials, and recipe content. The ""why it costs €1000"" justification ads perform incredibly well — they're not hiding the price, they're explaining the value.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/674675868548161) – Launched 84 days ago, live. 4.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 \~€59K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/2998387620362711) – Launched 68 days ago, live. 2.7M EU reach (💰💰 \~€32K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1539745014031292) – Launched 68 days ago, live. 1.6M EU reach (💰 \~€19K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 17 ads):**

    This is the best gift on the planet.

They lean heavily into gifting and holiday angles. Also crushing it with ""Why I'll NEVER buy Gordon Ramsay's non-toxic pan"" reverse psychology hooks. I found this hook across A LOT of brands and it's been working well for us too.

# 4. Leaf Co (318 active ads)

French skincare brand dominating the collagen mask niche with before/after testimonials.

They're 100% focused on the French market with UGC from real women (especially mature skin). The transformation format is simple but incredibly effective — they show the mask going on, time passing, and the visible results.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1714420702547346) – Launched 100 days ago, live. 6.4M EU reach, 5x creative (💰💰💰 \~€77K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/4174387169469219) – Launched 47 days ago. 1.8M EU reach, 5x creative (💰 \~€21K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/2801957659995635) – Launched 100 days ago, live. 1.3M EU reach, 5x creative (💰 \~€16K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 6 ads):**

    Ce masque collagène partout mais jamais testé sur une peau mature. Alors je vais l'essayer pour vous.
    (This collagen mask is everywhere but never tested on mature skin. So I'm going to try it for you.)

The ""testing for mature skin"" angle is genius — they're speaking directly to their 40+ female audience who feel ignored by skincare marketing.

# 5. The Essence Vault (229 active ads)

UK fragrance brand selling ""designer-inspired"" perfumes at a fraction of the price.

They use urgency like nobody else — ""SCENT PRICES HIKE INCOMING"" warnings that create FOMO. Their visual style is clean and premium, making £15 perfumes look like £200 bottles.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1300154065212432) – Launched 6 days ago, live. 2.6M EU reach, 4x creative (💰💰 \~€31K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/691801213801959) – Launched 6 days ago, live. 1.3M EU reach, 4x creative (💰 \~€16K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1850804995551461) – Launched 73 days ago, live. 838K EU reach (💰 \~€10K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 4 ads):**

    What are the top three best sellers on the Essence Vault?

Curiosity-driven listicle format. They also use comparison hooks like ""Take Baccarat Rouge for example, sells for £245. Meanwhile, the Essence Vault's version sells for £15.""

# 6. Endel (8 active ads but 11M+ reach)

The ultimate example of quality over quantity. This ADHD/focus app runs just 8 active ads but achieves massive scale.

They found the perfect hook — 852 Hz sounds for ADHD brains — and let it run. Their meme-style content (""me listening to this sound 24/7 ever since I found out it blocks your brain from overthinking"") drives insane engagement.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1860830991492795) – Launched 47 days ago, live. 6.3M EU reach, 2x creative (💰💰💰 \~€76K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/4041880446064249) – Launched 168 days ago. 5.9M EU reach (💰💰💰 \~€71K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1454773869009255) – Launched 146 days ago. 5.0M EU reach (💰💰 \~€60K spend)

**Their top hook:**

    This sound is 852 Hz. If you have ADHD, listen for 10 seconds and see how your brain reacts.

Interactive hooks that make you stop and actually engage. The meme format also works incredibly well — a dog on a train with text about blocking overthinking went viral.

# 7. AG1 by Athletic Greens (362 active ads)

The supplement giant with aggressive German/Dutch localization.

They run problem/solution format ads targeting morning fatigue, brain fog, and digestion issues. The Black Friday bundle offers with ""€88 GRATIS"" value stacking perform exceptionally well in German markets.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/792807713518393) – Launched 40 days ago. 1.4M EU reach (💰 \~€17K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/803131242567221) – Launched 40 days ago. 916K EU reach (💰 \~€11K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/1293336925733645) – Launched 150 days ago. 565K EU reach (💰 \~€7K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 9 ads):**

    Time to lock in on your health.

They also use creative formats like a woman holding signs listing problems (brain fog, tired, digestion) that flip to solutions.

# 8. WHOOP (45 active ads)

Wearable fitness tracker with aggressive EU localization push.

They're running Portuguese, German, and English variants of discount offers. The ""10% off annual memberships"" angle is consistent across all markets — they've found what works and are scaling it geographically.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1233610935250731) – Launched 4 days ago, live. 1.7M EU reach (💰 \~€21K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/1123060939907347) – Launched 4 days ago, live. 428K EU reach (💰 \~€5K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/25697937783134440) – Launched 4 days ago, live. 217K EU reach (💰 \~€3K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 5 ads):**

    There's still time to save 10% on Whoop memberships.

Urgency + discount. Simple but effective for a premium product.

# 9. Reverse Health (33 active ads)

Intermittent fasting app crushing it in Italian and Spanish markets.

They use localized testimonials and ""lose X kg without exercise"" messaging. The before/after transformation format dominates their creative strategy.

[**Example 1**](https://skaler.app/ad/1083185000441117) – Launched 149 days ago. 2.7M EU reach (💰💰 \~€33K spend)  
[**Example 2**](https://skaler.app/ad/790433980002960) – Launched 146 days ago. 1.7M EU reach, 2x creative (💰 \~€21K spend)  
[**Example 3**](https://skaler.app/ad/776307845085981) – Launched 149 days ago. 1.5M EU reach (💰 \~€18K spend)

**Their top hook (used in 3 ads):**

    Il tuo caffè nero senza zucchero. Vuoi un dessert?
    (Your black coffee without sugar. Want a dessert?)

Conversational Italian that feels native, not translated.

# Key Patterns I Noticed

**1. Localization separates the winners:** Loop runs 11 languages, AG1 dominates German markets, Leaf Co owns French skincare. The brands winning in EU aren't just translating — they're actually creating native content (and possibly have in-house deps for it).

**2. Before/after still works:** Leaf Co, Reverse Health, and even HexClad (for cookware results) all use transformation content. It's an evergreen format.

**3. Let winners run:** Endel runs 8 ads with 11M+ reach. The Ridge ran one ad for 258 days. Loop keeps winners live for 200+ days. Don't retire what's working.

**4. Duplicated creatives within different audiences:** Multiple brands run the same creative across 3-5x ad sets with different targeting. Leaf Co runs their best UGC across 5 different ads. This only shows they're either scaling or testing different audiences.

**5. Urgency works (when done right):** The Essence Vault's ""price hike incoming"" angle, Loop's ""discount won't wait forever,"" WHOOP's ""still time to save"" — urgency drives action.

1pn7mfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Wallaby_9624/comments/1pn7mfd/i_started_testing_the_10_drinks_that_slow_down/,"I started testing the 10 Drinks That Slow Down Aging: Science-Backed Sips for Skin, Brain, and Body — here’s what actually felt different","I don’t think about “anti-aging” in a dramatic way. I’m not chasing youth or miracles. What I do care about is waking up with clear skin, steady energy, and a brain that doesn’t feel foggy by mid-afternoon. After a stretch of poor sleep and too much coffee, I realized most of what I was drinking wasn’t helping any of that.



So instead of buying supplements or fancy products, I focused on liquids. That’s how I landed on the idea behind 10 Drinks That Slow Down Aging: Science-Backed Sips for Skin, Brain, and Body.



I didn’t change everything at once. I just rotated a few drinks into my day—one in the morning, one later in the afternoon—and paid attention. Within about a week, the changes were subtle but real. My skin felt less dry. I wasn’t reaching for caffeine as often. Digestion felt calmer. Nothing dramatic, but definitely noticeable.



What stood out is that these aren’t “beauty drinks.” The 10 Drinks That Slow Down Aging: Science-Backed Sips for Skin, Brain, and Body idea is more about reducing inflammation and oxidative stress—things that quietly affect how we feel long before they show up on the outside.



A few things I learned quickly:



Hydration matters more than I thought, but how you hydrate matters too



Antioxidant-rich drinks work better when they replace something (like soda or excess coffee)



Consistency beats intensity—daily habits matter more than occasional “healthy” days



One mistake I made early on was expecting fast visual changes. That didn’t happen. What did happen was better focus and fewer energy crashes, which honestly felt more valuable.



I followed this guide on 10 Drinks That Slow Down Aging: Science-Backed Sips for Skin, Brain, and Body

 because it explains the science behind each drink without hype. It helped me choose based on what I actually needed—skin support, brain clarity, or overall recovery.



I don’t believe drinks alone can stop aging. But the 10 Drinks That Slow Down Aging: Science-Backed Sips for Skin, Brain, and Body approach made me realize how much daily beverages influence inflammation, hydration, and long-term health. That mindset shift stuck with me.



Now I keep a short rotation instead of trying everything:



One antioxidant-focused drink



One hydration-focused option



One calming or brain-supporting drink



That’s it. Simple and sustainable.



Curious what others think—have you noticed real differences from changing what you drink daily, or do you feel anti-aging drinks are mostly hype?

1pn7lgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pn7lgt/new_to_this/,New to this,"So I'm posting in this forum because I believe I have gerd although I haven't gone to a doctor to confirm. 2 years ago I quit smoking Marijuana after years of chronic use with only a few breaks in between (pregnancy 6 years ago). A few weeks after quitting i ate a hamburger and got really really bad heartburn. I decided to cut back on meat as it was a trigger and since my mom has gerd and ibs i figured i have it too. A few weeks later I started smoking pot again chronically and never had a single bout of heartburn or stomach aches no matter what I ate. 

Fast forward two years later to now, I quit smoking pot again and this time it came back with a vengeance. Its affecting my daily life and my mental health. The reason I'm posting this is because my symptoms are confusing. Ive had a constant sour taste in my mouth and developed severe periodontal disease that went unchecked by my dentist for years. That's a whole other topic but I believe its related as my periodontist said it advanced drastically for someone my age. 

Anyways, my symptoms lately are heartburn (a mild burning and sometimes phlem i hack up) but no chest pain and I don't regurgitate but rather feel a constant sour stomach feeling. Im always bloated and have gas and burping throughout the day. Im getting keen on avoiding trigger foods but when I don't avoid them my stomach hurts so bad. It feels empty with bloating and a sour feeling. I have a sore throat sometimes and when I'm having a flair up, my nose and eyes burn and any strong smells around me make me sick and dizzy. It feels somewhat like i have pepper in my throat and nose and eyes. I also get in a bad mood. Im trying to be positive but the thought of eating this gerd diet forever makes me very depressed. I love to eat and cook and I love my coffee and chocolate. Im vegan so I don't eat dairy or meat and im eliminating triggers but its hard. Im 37, at a healthy weight and i dont smoke cigarettes. Im scared to go to the doctor because I've heard bad things about the meds they recommend and i know they recommend diet changes which im doing. Tums helps a little but when my stomach is sour it only works a little bit. The stomach aches return. The stomach aches are my biggest symptom. I also feel starving often especially in the morning combined with the stomach aches. Its not affecting my sleep but I'm often scared to eat. Its taking a toll on my mental health especially combined with my periodontal disease. I've done research till I'm blue in the face and feel stressed daily. I guess I just am confused and in need of someone to support me or relate. Does this sound like gerd? Or a stomach ulser? Thanks guys!",1,1765805998.0,GERD,2,0.99,False

AI Science and math would be empowering.  AI that can help achieve important breakthroughs that will make everyone's lives better.

AI that can make your latte at the local coffee shop is not going to change the world.

Last year I wore cute pajamas and felt like a slob in the photos lol, a year before I wore a nice outfit and was uncomfortable and overheated all morning... there has to be a middle ground between ""just rolled out of bed"" and ""why is mom dressed like she's going to brunch.""

I need something that looks intentional in photos but is basically as comfortable as loungewear. Ideally something I could also wear if we go to my in laws later without changing, you know? my requirements are basically: comfortable enough to sit criss cross on the floor, not too hot, looks put together on camera, can handle coffee spills and kid hugs, and doesn't scream ""I'm trying too hard for 7am”

Too many promises, not enough reality. Still, after a stretch of feeling bloated, low-energy, and off my routine, I decided to experiment—carefully. I didn’t starve myself or do anything extreme. I just added a few drinks to my day and paid attention to how my body responded. That’s what led me to the idea behind the **6 Best Detox Drinks to Flush Out Toxins & Boost Weight Loss**.

First thing I learned: detox drinks aren’t magic. They don’t “erase” bad habits. What they *can* do is support hydration, digestion, and consistency—especially when you’re trying to reset without going all-in on a strict plan.

I tried rotating simple options (lemon water variations, ginger-based drinks, green blends) across the week. I kept meals normal and focused on listening to cues. What surprised me wasn’t dramatic weight loss—it was how much *lighter* I felt by day three or four. Less bloating. Fewer late-night cravings. More motivation to keep meals simple.

The key with the **6 Best Detox Drinks to Flush Out Toxins & Boost Weight Loss** approach is timing and intention. These drinks worked best:

* In the morning before coffee
* Mid-afternoon instead of snacking
* With meals to encourage hydration

Another thing that helped was avoiding sweeteners. Once I stopped treating detox drinks like flavored juice, they felt more supportive and less like a sugar hit.

What I appreciated most is that the drinks are built around real ingredients you probably already have. No powders, no pricey cleanses. The guide I followed lays out options clearly and explains *why* each drink might help, which made it easier to choose what fit my day. If you want the exact breakdown, I used this guide on [**6 Best Detox Drinks to Flush Out Toxins & Boost Weight Loss**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/6-best-detox-drinks-to-flush-out-toxins-boost-weight-loss/).

Would I say detox drinks alone cause weight loss? No. But paired with normal meals and better hydration, the **6 Best Detox Drinks to Flush Out Toxins & Boost Weight Loss** can make it easier to stay on track—especially when motivation is low.

I’m curious: have any of you added simple detox-style drinks (lemon water, ginger, green blends) into your routine? Did you notice real changes, or did it feel like hype?

1pn7bj7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn7bj7,Unpopular Opinion? Z-Image might just be the new King of Realism & Speed (vs Flux.2 & Ovis),"The speed of AI image generation models right now is insane. Just when we thought Flux.1 was the endgame, we suddenly have **Flux.2**, **Z-Image**, and **Ovis Image** dropping at the same time.

I’ve spent the last few days stressing my GPU to compare these three. Everyone is hyping up Flux.2 because of its massive parameter count, but after extensive testing, I think **Z-Image** (from Tongyi Lab) is actually the one sleeping on the throne—especially if you care about **photorealism, character consistency, and speed**.

Here is my breakdown of the ""Big Three"" right now.

# 🥊 The Contenders

**1. Flux.2 (The Heavyweight)**

* **Stats:** 32B Parameters.
* **Vibe:** The ""brute force"" monster. It understands complex prompts and spatial logic incredibly well.
* **Best for:** Cinematic composition, complex multi-subject scenes.

**2. Ovis Image (The Designer)**

* **Stats:** 7B Parameters.
* **Vibe:** The typography specialist.
* **Best for:** Rendering text inside images, posters, and UI design.

**3. Z-Image (The Speedster)**

* **Stats:** 6B Parameters (S3-DiT architecture).
* **Vibe:** The photographer.
* **Best for:** Raw realism, ""uncensored"" textures, and lightning-fast generation.

# ⚔️ The Showdown

I tested them on three main criteria: **Realism**, **Consistency**, and **Speed**. Here is why Z-Image surprised me.

# Round 1: Realism (The ""Plastic"" Test)

We all know that ""AI glossy look""—smooth skin, perfect lighting.

* **Flux.2:** Technically perfect, but too perfect. It often looks like a high-end CG render or a heavily photoshopped magazine cover.
* **Z-Image:** **This wins hands down.** It embraces imperfections. It generates skin pores, grease, film grain, and ""messy"" lighting that looks like a raw camera shot. It de-synthesizes the image in a way Flux hasn't figured out yet.

# Round 2: Consistency (The Storyteller Test)

If you are making comics or consistent characters:

* **Flux.2:** Good, but micro-features (eye shape, hair flow) tend to drift when you change the camera angle.
* **Z-Image:** Because of its Single-Stream DiT architecture, it locks onto the subject's ID incredibly well. I ran a batch with different actions, and the face remained virtually identical without needing a heavy LoRA training.

# Round 3: Speed (The Workflow Test)

* **Flux.2:** It's a 32B model. Unless you have a 4090 (24GB VRAM), you are going to be waiting a while per image.
* **Z-Image:** It has a **Turbo mode (8 steps)**. It is ridiculously fast. On consumer GPUs, it generates high-quality images in seconds. It’s vastly more efficient for rapid prototyping.

# 🧪 Try It Yourself (Prompts)

Don't take my word for it. Here are the prompts I used. Compare the results yourself.

**Test 1: The ""Raw Photo"" Test**

>raw smartphone photo, amateur shot, flash photography, close up portrait of a young woman with freckles, messy hair, eating a burger in a diner, grease on face, imperfect skin texture, hard lighting, harsh shadows, 4k, hyper realistic

**Test 2: Atmospheric Lighting**

>analog film photo, grainy style, a messy artist desk, morning sunlight coming through blinds, dust particles dancing in light, cluttered papers, spilled coffee, cinematic lighting, depth of field, fujifilm simulation

# 🏆 The Verdict

* If you need **text on images**, go with **Ovis**.
* If you need **complex spatial logic** (e.g., ""an astronaut riding a horse on Mars holding a sign""), **Flux.2** is still the smartest.
* **BUT**, if you want **photorealism that fools the human eye**, **consistent characters**, and **fast workflow**, **Z-Image** is the current meta.

Flux.2 is an artist; Z-Image is a photographer.

**TL;DR:** Flux.2 is powerful but slow and ""AI-looking."" Z-Image is faster (6B params), locks character faces better, and produces results that look like actual raw photography.

1pn79f3,https://i.redd.it/xqr6oi94dd7g1.jpeg,What going through years of unjustified experiments does to a MF,"Some instances :
- Diane Tremblay: with the power of revealing the truth, she is firm as a teacher, but outside of it, she is chill, enjoys walks, coffee and weekend drinks
- Aka Lunka: blind old man with fatherly attitude, showing some tough love to his students. Manipulate rocks and metal
- Leonora Greenwich: extroverted woman, controlling plants, that would grow weed of you ask politely. She is ""live, love, laugh""
- Frederick Bant: not a teacher, but the school med. Former benevolent for *Médecins Sans Frontières*, before he went back to his native home after being shot in the shoulder. Despite still being in pain, he has a constant warm smile, a lot of patience, and infinite care. His powers allows him to do X-RAY on the spot
- Archibald Forge: school principal, an old man that has a loud and easy laugh, ready to tap yoir shoulder while calling you ""son"" right before you go on detention. And he loves whiskey. And can bend metal


Okay, now the last one, more developed because he has the advantage of being one of the main characters: Guillaume Norian. In the middle of this stable cast of teachers, he is taciturn, bitter, cynical, and deep contempt against professional heroes. One topic he works on, philosophy, has one main question : ""if someone is a villain for 95% of the population, but a hero for 5, what are they ?""
Deep down, he is in constant pain because of the power he was forced to have through experiments : he can materialize a sort of dark matter to shoot beams or create weapons. But each usage slowly corrodes him. He spiralled into an addiction to oxycodone, a self destructive behaviour, and adopted a secret identity as a villain (or maybe anti-villain) trying to get revenge. He is alone, lives alone, and tries to push away anyone who tries to get closer to him, fearing that they could be injured by association with him. So he tries to be as corrosive as possible with everyone, so that the day he will have to pay for his actions as a villain, no one will be truly hurt. He would rather be hated than seeing anyone suffering because of his quest for revenge

That's obviously destroying him even more, but he prefers self destruction than wanting anyone to worry about him

Up until the 50% completion mark, I kept thinking that this was some kind of Dark Souls of racing games and I was wondering why such a fun game had no cult following whatsoever. Without any embellishment, I truly thought that Crash Time II is an incredible love child of Flatout and Burnout. I was quite surprised when I saw the top reviews were negative and the game sat at a mixed score.  
  
Following baddies across town in a miniaturized Germany that still looks on par with most recent indie and AA games, taking them down by some well-executed manoeuvres and ridiculous stunts, or using my map knowledge to halt them at exactly the right spot was thrilling. Having to end my pursuit because I got spun out by a high-speed train, or not being able to follow the AI because a bus inadvertently blocked the autobahn exit, the AI having a good degree of unpredictable behaviour created some great moments of emergent gameplay. Adding the ridiculous challenges to this gameplay formula where you need to jump on top of a skyscraper to take down a helicopter or skipping through some half sunk containers to get across a canal quickly, or using RC cars to blow up trucks made this the Flatout sequel I always wanted, even more than Wreckfest.  
  
There is a sweet spot between tension and comfort. Comfort, in knowing your abilities and the limitations of the tool you have in your hand and tension in having to apply your abilities in difficult situations. Crash Time II hit that exact spot. I like being afraid of my own speed and having to manage my finger on the W button. Crash Time II’s car physics are pretty good and weighty, and busy streets and autobahns make pressing W a choice you have to make. Damage model is impressive too, even today. There is nothing more satisfying and infuriating than resetting progress because I’ve lost a wheel when I rammed into a bad guy without thinking about the consequences.  
  
The voice acting sucked, story was boring at best, and those feeble attempts at humour fell flat on their face because of their innate Germanness. Still, even if I disregarded the gameplay, there was much to love here. Crash Time II perfectly encapsulates not only late 2000’s but also Germanness with its Euroslop soundtrack, missions where you have to stop beer carrying trucks because fermentation process went wrong, and environmentalists kidnapping a nuclear plant manager. Humour often missed its mark, but initial setup for most missions are “we have nothing to do, let’s go grab a coffee/get tickets for the circus/have a race for the fun of it/have a beer with a friend” and this drew a chuckle out of me every time by inadvertently showing how useless the pigs are. I even loved this game’s feeble attempts at humour.  
  
Still, I’m an idiot. I was losing between 5 to 15 percent of my speed anytime during gear changes, even though I was playing with automatic transmission. I didn’t get the reasoning for this design decision, but it made the car fight against what I want to do. This was frustrating, because one wrong move could set my progress back ten minutes and make me replay the same case over and over again. I liked this decision though, because not only I had to conquer my enemies, but I also had to tame the car I was driving. I attributed the loss of speed to gear ratios being wonky and thought that this would be fixed when I unlocked better cars.  
  
Better cars didn’t fix the issue and around 50% completion I came across a dirt race that required jumping over an obstacle at a certain speed. This was simply impossible, because right before the jump I was losing 20 kph and there was no space to gain more speed before the jump. So, I checked out Steam forums for a walkthrough and stumbled upon a thread talking about how unbinding shift up button will cause the game to think you’re shifting up any time you press A to turn left…  
  
There has never been a harder facepalm in the history of men. This game wasn’t challenging at all, let alone being the Dark Souls of racing games. This game was easy as fuck. There was no challenge other than the one I idiotically set for myself. If there is no challenge there is no sweet spot, there is no tension, there is no fucking comfort. The remaining 50% went by like a breeze, without excitement, without difficulty. I unbinded the shift up button again, but the magic was lost and it wasn’t coming back.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


#### **1. WANNY & BUZZY - Saints On Edge 💎 [Ridmic]**  
*Recommended if you like: NELSØN, KNGHT, Genetics*  

**WANNY & BUZZY**? What is this, a reboot of the _Hanni & Nanni_ cinematic universe? Not quite. With this debut release of theirs, we actually got a _Hidden Gem Of The Week™️_ on our hands, but let's first introduce our protagonists here.

**1.1. Buzz Lowfeber**

First up, we've got Dutch producer-CEO-coder Bas Lefeber - who I guess is the BUZZY part of the name? As is most often the case with debuts as lovely as this, there's some artistic history to uncover, aside from him playing piano from an early age and studying at the Herman Brood Academy. That's right, since 2017 he's also been known as **Buzz Low**! With a hands-in-the-air remake of _Supermode_'s legendary 'Tell Me Why' and a handful of healthily bouncy singles on _Strange Fruits_, he started to make a name for himself, but the real breakthrough came with two specific chunes. First, his remix of _PLAYDED_'s 'Friends & Lovers', which saw early support by _Oliver Heldens_, and shortly after, his original 'This Is Us', similarly pushed by HI-LO's alter ego. This early, wider attention in the scene kept rising and rising, thanks to Bas landing a top 5 slot, and thus an official release, in _Afrojack_'s _Global Remix Battle_. 

All that jazz turned the heads of even the one and only _Spinnin' Records_, leading to a series of seriously successful singles on Spinnin', with his Tech House rework of _Sisqo_'s fantastic family-friendly 'Thong Song' being his biggest hit. We really get all kinds of classics covered on here don't we! This whirlwind of an early career lead to more and more releases across the likes of _One Seven Music_, _Hexagon_, and _Kontor / Armada_, but Bas wanted to try out something else: Afro House! With his newly founded moniker **BACOLE**, he has been delivering all sorts of summer-y beach-y vibes on _One Seven_, _LoudKult_, and _It Was All A Dream_, but that's not all either! He has created _The Vocal Market_, a place to buy or sell acapellas, tried his hands at app development with _Rezept Tresor_, is fiddling with AI stuff - I'm gonna stay far, far away from any of that - and has now finally decided to put the Drum & before his first name, as **WANNY & BUZZY **. So let's talk about WANNY then!

**1.2. SWANtje WANNYka**

On the other side of the equation we got Swantje Wanika, who just _has_ to be WANNY or my world is going to collapse in on itself. To be honest, I could not find a whole lot about her, outside of more entrepeneurial ventures like the co-founding of _PuriPet Petfood_, who even made it to the German version of _Shark Tank_, and _leckker_, a freeze-dried fruit store, as part of her Marketing Strategist job. None of that has anything to do with DnB or music though, so I'm just gonna jump into their debut now!

**1.3. Saints On Edge**

As the newest entry on the discography of **Ridmic**, Liquicity's imprint for up-and-coming names in the DnB realm, **Saints On Edge** fits right in. Most lovely vocals that lyrically walk the line between sin and virtue on top of soft pianos reverberating throughout our inner church halls lead us to a delightful vocal chop synth frolicking in our ears while a chuggy, bouncy dancefloor bassline keeps the pace. While not necessarily _groundbreaking_, the way these high quality key ingredients were sliced, diced and cooked together still very much results in one wonderful meal of a tune, and speaks to the aforementioned experience of the people involved.

**1.4. Conclusion**    

A bit of a bouncy, beautiful, buzzy banger. Excited to see what else they conjure up in the future!

Other dancefloor from this week:  
- ShockOne, Loboski, In:Aura - Rewired   
- BTWRKS, Rex Hooligan, Maggie - through the haze  
- [BORDERS], Puzzle - Against All Odds  
- Xave - Show Me Love 💎 (fka as Xav James)  
- Various Artists - Riot Supply

#### **2. GROUND - Petrichor [Drum & Bass Arena]**  
*Recommended if you like: Submarine, Fre4knc, Rizzle*  

Staying in the general German-understanding and in this case even -speaking area of Europe, we head on over to Switzerland, or Zürich, to be perfectly precise, to talk about one of this scene's finest, and genuinely still most underrated artists in the deeper and darker subgenres. Let's talk about **GROUND**!

**2.1. Back-GROUND**

While quite the prolific artist under the very alias we have come to know and love here, there is not a whole lot that GROUNDskeeper Pascal Schubert has shared of his musical upbringing, possible bands or classical training, so we're just going to start in 2016. As **Tinderbox**, Pascal dove head-first into the scene with his debut EP _Abyssus_ on _IN:DEEP_ - and that's all the Tinderbox lore I got for ya. A year later, _Ground_ and then _GROUND_ were already born, with free downloads 'Ssy' and 'Form', _Principle Records_ one-off 'White Russian' and, most notably, his entry into _Flexout_'s _ONYX_ EP series. Truly hitting the ground running (sorry) early on, he launched into a proper _avalanche_ of releases on the likes of _Dispatch_, (the one and only) _Music Squad_, _Overview_, and even VISION sub-label _Invisible_, right before its demise, collaborating with names like _Skylark_ and _Fre4knc_, all before we even get to the 2020s! Oh yeah, he also founded _NATIVA:LEAF_ during these times. A surprising amount of GmbH talk today! 

Not only did the new decade see Pascal deliver more outrageously huge tunes and entirely extraordinary EPs on _Flexout_ (shout-out 'Two Ways' and 'Regain'), and _Overview_ (that 'Ein' EP, man!), he also created the music for Linus von Stumberg's short film _Lion's Cage_ and provided the absolute earthquake-ian production that was _Terra_ for _LaMeduza_'s self-titled EP. In more recent times, he branched out a bit, tackling _Pilot_ and _UKF_ with _Skylark_, and officially remixing _Noisia_'s 'Collider' and _Buunshin_'s 'Retaliate', but he still very much took part in Overview's legendary writers camp, resulting in the mega collab 'Geiser' with _YAANO_ and _Rueben_. This week, he added another name to the label rolodex of his: formerly award-hosting and forum-having imprint **Drum & Bass Arena**!

**2.2. Petrichor**

For this formidable debut, Pascal bottled up the smell rain produces when falling on soil and turned it into a musical journey through the darkest depths our ears are able to process, on **Petrichor**. Ominous, nay, outright _threatening_ growls vibrating through the night, drums coming in closer and closer, all leading us to the foundation-rattling earthquake of a drop, where nasty little dark outbursts trade blows with the stylish snare, before everything wobbles further and further into the abyss, with hi-hats raining down upon us. Maximum volume recommended.

**2.3. Conclusion**

Outstanding atmospheric work, bass so deeply rattling it will unravel even the tightest knots in your body - I could bathe in this sort of tune

1pn75zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pn75zd/inconsistent_espresso_shots_whats_going_on_lelit/,"Inconsistent espresso shots, what's going on? [Lelit Elizabeth / Timemore Sculptor 078SSP]","Hello [r/espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/)! After being gifted a Lelit Elizabeth a couple weeks ago I'm on my own espresso journey and struggling with dialing in a good shot. I went all in on buying a Timemore Sculptor 078SSP to go with the machine. I figured I wanted a grinder for the long term but now I wonder if I overcomplicated myself with high-end burrs.

My results with this setup have been mixed. I managed to dial my current coffee to 1.8 in the Timemore's scale and I'm able to get around 1:2.5-3 with some consistency, with 18g on the double basket. But every other shot seems to go wrong and end up getting 1:4-5 which ends up being bad even for a latte. I don't seem to be able to get to the 1:2 that I'm looking for although I've been close a couple times.

My theory right now is that for some reason sometimes the puck channels like crazy, but I don't seem to be doing anything differently between shots. I do WDT and make sure the puck is flat and smooth before tamping and I'm pretty sure I tamp appropriately (I got an auto leveling MHW3 tamper with pressure feedback).

Of course I've been dialing the grinder but it's really confusing when I cannot know if the changes are the result of the grind size change or because I messed something in the process.

Another theory is that I need to grind coarser and thus I'm just getting different amounts of channeling each time. Also I've heard the grinder is supposed to get more consistent results as I keep using it for around 7-8kg but I wonder if this should be so noticeable.

So I would love any tip about what to look for. I'm waiting for a bottomless portafilter so I can analyze the extraction better, but meanwhile I'm just guessing.",1,1765804824.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1pn7545,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn7545,"My First Time in Aveiro, Portugal in Spring 2018","On my first trip to Aveiro, I was incredibly excited, it was something I had planned for months. I visited in spring 2024, which turned out to be a great time to go thanks to the mild weather and fewer crowds.

When I arrived, the first thing I did was head to my accommodation near the city center, close to the canals. Staying in this area is very convenient: everything is walkable, and you’re just steps away from cafés, restaurants, and the main sights. Aveiro has a calm, relaxed atmosphere, especially early in the morning when the canals are quiet and the city slowly wakes up.

After checking in, I took a walk along the canals and explored the historic center, admiring the Art Nouveau buildings and watching the traditional moliceiro boats glide through the water. I also stopped by the area near the Aveiro Museum (Santa Joana), which gives a nice cultural insight into the city’s history.

Another highlight was visiting Costa Nova, just a short drive away. The iconic striped houses along the beach are even more charming in person, and the Atlantic coast there feels wild and refreshing. Walking along the beach and the lagoon at sunset was definitely one of my favorite moments of the trip.

I also made sure to try ovos moles, Aveiro’s most famous traditional sweet, simple, but absolutely delicious. Sitting by the canals with a coffee and dessert felt like the perfect way to slow down and enjoy the city.

If you’re planning a trip, I’d say 2–3 days is perfect to explore Aveiro at a relaxed pace, especially if you combine it with Costa Nova or nearby towns. It’s an ideal stop between Lisbon and Porto.

In the photos: 1 and 2 Aveiro canals and moliceiro boats

1pn73hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1pn73hb/i_lied_on_my_resume_and_now_im_trapped_in_my_own/,I lied on my resume and now I’m trapped in my own “success”,"I got hired for a job I genuinely wanted, and I’ve been doing it for a few months now. I should be happy. Instead I feel like I’m walking around with a flashing sign that says fraud. The confession part is simple: I lied on my resume. Not like “I speak fluent French” when I can only order coffee. I stretched my experience in a way that got me through screening and into interviews, and I know it was wrong.

I was stuck in a loop of applying, getting rejected, applying again. I kept hearing “we need someone who’s already done X.” The problem is you can’t get X without someone letting you do X. So I changed a few lines. I took a project I helped with and made it sound like I led it. I bumped my title on one previous role, not wildy different but enough to look like a step up. I also listed a tool as “proficient” when really I’d used it in a tutorial and a couple small tasks. In my head it felt like I was just translating what I could do into the language employers want to see. In reality I know I crossed a line.

The worst part is… it worked. I got hired. The team is actually nice. My manager is supportive, gives clear feedback, doesn’t humiliate anyone. The pay is the first time in my life I’ve felt like I can breathe. I’m not rich or anything, but I can buy groceries without calculating every item, and I can say yes to a friend inviting me out without panicking. I don’t want to lose that. I also don’t want to keep lying. I keep thinking, okay, I’ll prove myself and it’ll “even out” and then the lie won’t matter anymore. But that’s not how integrity works, I know.

Day to day, I’m doing fine. I ask questions, I take notes, I stay late sometimes. I’ve been quietly learning the stuff I claimed I knew. I watch videos at night, I read documentation on weekends, I practice on a dummy account. But every meeting I’m terrified someone will ask something super basic and I’ll freeze. And if I do answer correctly, I still feel sick because it’s like I’m wearing someone else’s ID and getting away with it. There are moments where my manager says “great work on that” and I feel this sharp guilt, like I’m stealing praise.

I’m also scared of the practical consequences. If this ever comes out, I’m not just embarrassed, I’m fired. Maybe blacklisted. I’m the kind of person who used to return an extra dollar if a cashier gave me too much change, so I don’t even recognize myself here. The pressure got to me and I did something I never thought I’d do. I’ve even started deleting old messages and being weirdly careful about what I write down because I’m afraid of leaving a trail, which is gross and paranoid and makes me feel worse.

I don’t know what I’m asking for, because I know the right answer is “don’t lie.” I know. I already did it. I just needed to say it somewhere because I can’t tell anyone in real life. My friends would judge me, my family would freak out, and I can’t risk my job. I feel guilty even typing this, but also relived. I keep thinking about the person who maybe got rejected because I took a spot I didn’t deserve. And I keep thinking about how one background check or one call to an old coworker could blow up my life. I hate that I’m in this situation, and I hate that I put myself here.

The owner was popping in and out to talk to me. I mentioned to him that I was waiting for my partner and he should be here shortly. Anyway, the man invited me inside and gave me coffee on the house because he was cold while talking to me. I went in KNOWING he will walk in and see the owner and I.

Fast forward to now, he’s saying I act like I’m single, I don’t protect him, or us or the relationship. He also stated that I’m bonding with other men and inviting them in for a connection. He’s saying he’s gonna meet up with females who are interested in him just for “harmless coffee.” I told him to go ahead as I trust him and I trust myself. 

I told him he engages and interacts with women and entertains them. He had one friend send him 50+ messages. Another one who was harping on childhood memories. Another one he has to be a reference for. All of these people have/had feelings for him. I told him he’s applying a double standard to me and if he wants me to not interact with any men then he shouldn’t entertain others because according to his logic, that’s inviting them in.

I really feel stuck.

TL;DR:

I was waiting for my partner outside a café when the owner invited me inside and gave me a free coffee. I did nothing secretive and expected my partner to walk in at any moment. He’s now accusing me of acting single, emotionally bonding with other men, and not protecting our relationship. In response, he says he’ll meet women who are interested in him for “harmless coffee.” I pointed out his double standard — he regularly interacts with women who have or had feelings for him — but he doesn’t see it that way.

1pn6wtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pn6wtq/would_anyone_use_a_simple_coffee_app/,Would anyone use a simple coffee app? 🤔,"Hey coffee people,

I’m fairly new to specialty coffee and keep running into the same issue:
I tweak grind size, a shot gets better or worse… and a few days later I’ve already forgotten what I changed and why it helped.

I’m not looking for a hardcore brew log. No temperatures, no ratios, no spreadsheets.

The idea I’m exploring is a very user-friendly coffee log where you can:
	•	Add a coffee you’re currently drinking
	•	Keep personal grinder notes (just for yourself)
	•	Log simple dialing attempts like:
	•	ground a bit finer / coarser
	•	extraction felt under / ok / over
	•	taste moved in the right or wrong direction
	•	Over time, see which changes actually worked for you with that coffee

More “was this better than the last cup?”
Less “93°C, 18g in, 36g out”.

No social feed, no rankings, no flexing. Just a personal learning tool.

I’m curious:
	•	Would you personally use something like this?
	•	What features would it absolutely need to be worth using?
	•	Do you already use an app (or method) that solves this well? If yes — which one and why?

Not selling anything — just trying to figure out if this solves a real problem or if existing tools already do it better.

Blunt feedback welcome.

1pn6v4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pn6v4s/fixing_my_mental_health_was_the_biggest_life/,Fixing my mental health was the biggest life cheat code (everything got easier after this),"I spent years trying to be productive, disciplined, and successful while my mental health was in the gutter.

Nothing worked. I'd start strong Monday, crash by Wednesday, hate myself by Friday.

Then I fixed my mental health first. Everything else fell into place without effort. Productivity. Relationships. Money. All of it got easier.

Here's what nobody tells you:

Mental health isn't a separate category from ""real life"" - it's the foundation everything else is built on

You can't build discipline on depression. You can't build wealth on anxiety. You can't build relationships on emotional instability.

I was trying to construct a house on quicksand and wondering why it kept collapsing.

1. Sleep is 80% of your mental health, fix it first

I used to sleep 5-6 hours, chug coffee, and wonder why I felt anxious and depressed all day.

Turns out your brain literally can't regulate emotions properly without sleep. Everything feels catastrophic at 6 hours that feels manageable at 8.

What I changed:

* Lights out by 11pm, no negotiation
* Phone charges in bathroom, not bedroom
* No screens 30 minutes before bed
* Room completely dark (blackout curtains)
* Same wake time every day, even weekends

Within two weeks, my baseline anxiety dropped by half. Not exaggerating. Sleep debt was making everything harder.

2. Movement is medicine, not optional

I'm not talking about intense workouts. I'm talking about moving your body for 20-30 minutes daily.

Depression had me glued to my couch. Anxiety had my chest tight and breathing shallow. Both improved dramatically when I started walking every morning.

Why it works: Exercise literally changes your brain chemistry. Increases BDNF (grows new brain cells), regulates cortisol (stress hormone), releases endorphins (natural mood boost).

Start here with 20-minute walk outside every morning. Before phone, before work, before excuses. Non-negotiable. Watch your mental state shift in two weeks.

3. Your environment is poisoning you and you don't notice

Messy room. Cluttered desk. No natural light. Junk food everywhere. Toxic people in your phone.

All of it compounds into mental fog you think is just ""who you are.""

I cleaned my space, added plants, opened curtains, organized my desk. Sounds stupid but my brain calmed down immediately. Your environment creates constant background stress you've normalized.

Quick wins:

* Make your bed every morning (one tiny win before the day starts)
* Clean your space weekly (chaos outside creates chaos inside)
* Get sunlight within 30 minutes of waking (regulates circadian rhythm)
* Remove junk food from your house (willpower has limits, environment doesn't)

4. Therapy isn't weakness, it's efficiency

I avoided therapy for 3 years because I thought I could ""figure it out myself.""

Wasted 3 years spinning in the same patterns.

First session with a good therapist? Got tools I'd never have found alone. CBT techniques for anxiety. Framework for processing emotions. Perspective on patterns I couldn't see.

Real talk: You wouldn't try to fix your car's transmission without a mechanic. Why try to fix complex mental health issues without a professional?

If money's tight, look into sliding scale therapists or online options like BetterHelp. One month of therapy taught me more than three years of self-help books.

5. What you consume shapes your mental state

I was doom-scrolling news, watching depressing shows, listening to angry podcasts, hanging in negative Reddit threads.

Then wondered why I felt hopeless and anxious all day.

Changed my inputs:

* No news first thing in morning (starts day in fear mode)
* Curated social feeds to remove negativity
* Audiobooks and educational podcasts instead of doom content
* Positive or neutral TV before bed, not crime docs

Your brain doesn't distinguish between real threats and consumed threats. Feed it negativity all day and it thinks the world is ending.

6. Connection is non-negotiable for humans

I isolated when depressed. ""Don't want to burden anyone"" and ""they won't get it.""

Big mistake. Isolation makes everything worse. Humans are wired for connection. Without it, your brain starts eating itself.

What helped:

* One real conversation per day (not texts, actual talking)
* Joined a gym/class/group (forced social interaction)
* Called one friend per week (even when I didn't feel like it)
* Said yes to invites even when anxious (usually felt better after)

You don't need 50 friends. You need 2-3 people you can be real with.

7. Track your basics like data, not feelings

Started rating my day 1-10 and logging: hours slept, if I exercised, if I ate real food, time outside, social interaction.

Patterns emerged fast. Bad mental health days ALWAYS followed: poor sleep, no movement, isolated, ate garbage, stayed inside.

It wasn't random. It was predictable.

Now I know: if I sleep 7 hours, skip the gym, and eat fast food, tomorrow will suck. So I don't let those align anymore.

Track for two weeks. You'll see your patterns clear as day.

Fix your mental health and everything else gets easier.

Better sleep → more energy → easier to work out → better mood → easier to eat well → better sleep

It's a positive spiral once you start it.

But most people try to build discipline while depressed and anxious. That's like trying to run a marathon with a broken leg.

Heal first. Build second.

Fix your mental health. Everything else gets easier.

That's the cheat code.",8,1765803934.0,TheImprovementRoom,2,1.0,False
1pn6v1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafe/comments/1pn6v1o/would_anyone_use_a_simple_coffee_app/,Would anyone use a simple coffee app?,"Hey coffee people,

I’m fairly new to specialty coffee and keep running into the same issue:
I tweak grind size, a shot gets better or worse… and a few days later I’ve already forgotten what I changed and why it helped.

I’m not looking for a hardcore brew log. No temperatures, no ratios, no spreadsheets.

The idea I’m exploring is a very user-friendly coffee log where you can:
	•	Add a coffee you’re currently drinking
	•	Keep personal grinder notes (just for yourself)
	•	Log simple dialing attempts like:
	•	ground a bit finer / coarser
	•	extraction felt under / ok / over
	•	taste moved in the right or wrong direction
	•	Over time, see which changes actually worked for you with that coffee

More “was this better than the last cup?”
Less “93°C, 18g in, 36g out”.

No social feed, no rankings, no flexing. Just a personal learning tool.

I’m curious:
	•	Would you personally use something like this?
	•	What features would it absolutely need to be worth using?
	•	Do you already use an app (or method) that solves this well? If yes — which one and why?

Not selling anything — just trying to figure out if this solves a real problem or if existing tools already do it better.

Blunt feedback welcome.

Every night shift, the sonar shows something pacing us just beneath the hull, always matching our speed. The captain says it’s been doing that longer than I’ve worked there...","I’ve been afraid of deep water for as long as I can remember.

Not drowning — that’s too simple.
It’s the idea of distance.
Of standing on something thin while miles of dark press up beneath you, empty and alive at the same time.

That’s why I took the ferry job.

Short routes.
Close to shore.
Shallow enough that charts still showed numbers instead of blanks.

And it paid well.

Night shifts, mostly. Less traffic. Fewer passengers. Just the hum of the engines, the slap of water against the hull, and the steady green glow of the instruments in the bridge.

I avoided the sonar screen at first.

Everyone does. You tell yourself it’s just data. Lines. Blips. Noise.

Until it isn’t.

My third week in, I noticed it for the first time around 1:30 AM.

A return.

Clean.
Solid.
Too steady to be debris.

It sat just off our starboard side, maybe thirty feet down. Not below us — beside us.

I watched it for a full minute, waiting for it to drift.

It didn’t.

It matched our speed exactly.

When the ferry accelerated, it accelerated.
When we slowed approaching the dock, it slowed too.

I leaned closer to the screen, pulse creeping up my throat.

“Probably a seal,” I muttered.

The captain didn’t even look.

“Seals don’t do that,” he said.

I waited for him to elaborate.

He didn’t.

The return stayed with us all the way to the dock.

When we stopped, it stopped.

When the engines idled, it hovered.

And when we pulled away, it followed again — slipping back into position like it had practiced the maneuver a thousand times.

After that, I tried not to look.

Tried.

But night water does things to your brain. The horizon disappears. The ferry feels smaller. Thinner. Like a plate floating on ink.

And every time I glanced at the sonar, it was there.

Same depth.
Same distance.
Same pace.

Always just below the hull.

Never directly under.

That was worse.

I finally asked the captain on my sixth night shift.

“How long has that thing been on the sonar?” I asked, keeping my voice casual.

He took a sip of burnt coffee and stared straight ahead through the windshield.

“Longer than you’ve worked here.”

I laughed weakly. “No, seriously.”

He didn’t smile.

“This route used to be longer,” he said. “Used to cut farther out before they redrew it.”

My stomach tightened.

“And?”

“And it followed us then too.”

I swallowed. “So what is it?”

The captain finally turned his head and looked at me.

Not amused.
Not scared.

Just tired.

“We don’t name it,” he said. “Names make people curious. Curious people lean over rails.”

I didn’t ask anything after that.

I wish I had.

Because around 3:00 AM, something changed.

The sonar return rose.

Not fast.

Not aggressive.

Just… closer.

Ten feet shallower than before.

Then another five.

I stared at the screen, my mouth dry.

“Captain,” I said quietly.

“I see it,” he replied.

The water outside looked calm. Black glass. No wake disturbance. No surface ripple.

But the sonar showed a shape now.

Not just a dot.

A long, curved return that bent parallel to the hull.

Like something matching not just our speed…

…but our length.

I felt dizzy.

“How deep is the water here?” I asked.

The captain checked the chart.

“Eighty feet,” he said.

The sonar return sat at twenty-five.

I did the math without meaning to.

That left a lot of space beneath it.

A lot of dark.

A lot of room.

The ferry creaked softly — metal expanding, contracting, alive with stress.

Then the sonar blipped again.

The return dipped.

Then rose.

Then dipped again.

Like footsteps.

My throat closed.

“It’s pacing us,” I whispered.

The captain’s hands tightened on the wheel.

“No,” he said.

I looked at him.

He didn’t take his eyes off the water.

“It’s walking.”

The ferry horn sounded suddenly — long, low, mournful — though neither of us touched it.

I felt the vibration through my bones.

On the sonar, the shape adjusted instantly.

Perfectly.

Matching us.

Learning us.

And for the first time since I took the job, I realized something far worse than drowning:

Whatever was down there didn’t live in the deep.

It lived with us.

And it had memorized the route.

After that night, I couldn’t stop checking the water.

Not the surface — the surface lies. It reflects stars, hides depth, pretends everything below is calm and empty.

I started watching the sonar like it was a heartbeat monitor.

Every shift.
Every crossing.

And every time, it was there.

Same depth.
Same pace.
Same distance from the hull.

Never drifting.
Never falling behind.

Never passing us.

Always keeping up.

The worst part wasn’t the shape.

It was the consistency.

Ocean life moves. It wanders. It reacts to noise, light, vibration. Whales dive. Sharks arc. Schools scatter.

This thing didn’t do any of that.

It followed the route.

Not us.

The ferry could be replaced.
The crew could change.

But the path through the water?
That mattered.

I started noticing patterns the captain never pointed out.

At certain bends in the route, the sonar return adjusted before we did — like it anticipated the turn.
When we slowed early for fog, it slowed early too.
When we drifted off schedule, it waited.

Waiting was worse than following.

One night, I asked the captain why we never deviated.

“Why not cut a wider arc?” I asked. “Test it.”

He shook his head.

“Company tried that years ago.”

“And?”

“They lost sonar for twelve seconds.”

My stomach dropped. “Lost it how?”

“Blank screen,” he said. “No bottom. No returns. No depth.”

I stared at him. “In eighty feet of water?”

He nodded.

“When it came back,” he continued quietly, “the ferry was still moving. Still afloat. Still fine.”

I waited.

“But the return was underneath instead of beside.”

I felt my hands go numb.

“Directly under,” he added. “Matching the keel.”

That night, I dreamed of standing on glass.

Perfectly clear glass.

Miles of black water beneath my feet.

And something pressed up from below, testing the thickness.


---

The first passenger noticed it a week later.

She was leaning over the rail on the night crossing, staring down into the wake like people do when they want to feel small.

She didn’t scream.

She just backed away slowly and asked if there was “supposed to be a shadow down there.”

“There’s nothing there,” I said automatically.

She shook her head. “Not on the surface. Under it.”

I didn’t look.

She left early at the next stop.

After that, more people started avoiding the rails at night. Standing back. Sitting inside. Acting like the water made them uneasy without knowing why.

Fear travels upward.

It seeps.

The ferry started groaning more too — not damage, not strain. Just sound. Metal complaining the way it does when pressure changes.

Every creak made me imagine something brushing the hull.

Not scraping.

Just keeping pace.

I finally broke on a night when the sonar showed something new.

A second return.

Fainter.
Deeper.

Trailing behind the first.

I stared at the screen, bile rising in my throat.

“Captain,” I whispered.

He looked once.

Then closed his eyes.

“No,” he said. “Not yet.”

“What do you mean not yet?”

“They don’t come up together,” he said. “Not until—”

The ferry lurched.

Not hard. Not enough to alarm passengers.

Just enough to feel like the water had shifted against us.

The first return rose five feet.

The second rose ten.

My breathing went shallow.

“How many?” I asked.

The captain’s jaw tightened.

“We’ve only ever seen two,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean—”

The sonar blipped again.

A third return appeared.

Deeper still.

Far enough down that the bottom should have been between it and us.

But the bottom wasn’t there.

Just empty black on the screen.

The water depth reading flickered.

Dropped.

Rose.

Dropped again.

Like something massive had displaced it.

I felt the old childhood fear claw up from my gut — that primal terror of not knowing where the bottom is, of realizing the water under you is far deeper than you were told.

“How deep are we?” I whispered.

The captain didn’t answer.

He stared at the sonar.

At the three returns.

At the growing, impossible gap beneath them.

Then he said something I will never forget.

“They’re lining up.”

The ferry horn sounded again — long, low, automatic.

On the sonar, all three shapes adjusted at once.

Perfect synchronization.

Like feet stopping mid-step.

And beneath them…

The screen finally showed the bottom.

Much farther down than the charts claimed.

Much farther down than the water should allow.

As if the sea had been holding something open.

Waiting for us to pass.

After the third return appeared, the captain stopped speaking unless he had to.

That scared me more than anything he could’ve said.

The bridge felt smaller.
Lower.
Like the ceiling had dropped an inch and nobody wanted to admit it.

The sonar screen glowed sickly green in the dark, three long shapes pacing us now — staggered, layered, each one deeper than the last. They moved with a precision that made my skin crawl.

Not circling.
Not hunting.

Escorting.

I kept glancing out at the water even though I knew better. The surface was calm, black and flat, reflecting the night sky so perfectly it felt upside-down — like we were sailing across a void with stars below instead of above.

I hate that feeling.
Like the world could flip at any moment and nothing would change.

“Captain,” I said finally, my voice barely steady, “why doesn’t anyone talk about this?”

He exhaled slowly.

“Because it doesn’t touch us,” he said. “Not directly.”

My stomach twisted. “That’s not comforting.”

“It’s not meant to be,” he replied. “It’s a rule.”

“A rule for what?”

He didn’t answer right away. He reached into a drawer and pulled out an old laminated route chart — yellowed, edges cracked from years of use.

“This isn’t the first ferry,” he said quietly. “Or the second. Or the fifth.”

He pointed to a stretch of water marked faintly in pencil, not part of the official route.

“This used to be deeper,” he continued. “Much deeper. Before the shoreline was filled in. Before the dredging.”

I leaned closer.

The pencil markings weren’t notes.

They were tallies.

Short lines. Grouped in fives.

“How many?” I asked.

The captain swallowed.

“That’s just for this crossing.”

The ferry creaked again — longer this time. A low groan that ran the length of the hull, like something heavy had leaned against it.

The first sonar return rose again.

Twenty feet.

Then fifteen.

I felt my legs go weak.

“That’s too close,” I whispered.

“I know,” the captain said. “It means they’re curious.”

“About what?”

He looked at me then.

About who.

A cold realization hit me all at once.

“They’re not pacing the boat,” I said slowly. “They’re pacing the people.”

The captain didn’t deny it.

“Certain shifts,” he said. “Certain crews. Certain passengers.”

My mouth went dry. “Why me?”

He studied me for a moment.

“Because you look down,” he said. “Even when you tell yourself not to.”

The sonar blipped again.

The second return shifted sideways — not much, just enough to break formation.

It was no longer parallel.

It was angling inward.

Toward the keel.

Toward the space directly beneath where I stood.

The ferry shuddered.

Passengers murmured somewhere below deck, uneasy without knowing why.

“Captain,” I said, panic creeping into my voice, “it’s under us.”

“Yes,” he said.

“And the others?”

“They’re waiting.”

“For what?”

He tightened his grip on the wheel.

“For it to decide.”

The depth gauge began to fluctuate wildly.

Eighty feet.
One hundred.
Two hundred.

That was impossible.

This route wasn’t that deep. I knew that. Everyone did.

But the numbers kept dropping.

Three hundred.
Four.

The third return began to rise.

I felt it then — not a bump, not a scrape.

Pressure.

Like standing on ice and realizing it’s bending.

The captain reached up and shut off the internal lights on the bridge.

“What are you doing?” I hissed.

“So they can see us better,” he said.

I stared at him. “That’s insane.”

He shook his head slowly.

“They don’t use eyes,” he said. “They use attention.”

The glass in the windows vibrated faintly.

I looked down at the sonar one last time.

The three shapes were no longer walking.

They were standing still.

Directly beneath us.

Stacked.

Perfectly aligned.

And beneath them…

Something vast shifted in the darkness — too big to show fully on the screen, only its outline flickering in and out like the edge of a continent moving.

The bottom vanished again.

Replaced by nothing.

Endless, waiting nothing.

My childhood fear came roaring back — that ancient, suffocating terror of deep water — the certainty that if you fall, you won’t hit anything for a very long time.

And something will notice you before you stop sinking.

The captain leaned close to me and whispered:

“Don’t think about how far down it goes.”

I shook, barely holding myself together.

“Why?”

Because the sonar blipped one final time.

And a new line of text appeared on the screen.

Not numbers.

Not data.

A word.

LOOKING.

The water outside the windows darkened, like the night itself was leaning upward toward us.

And somewhere beneath the hull, something enormous adjusted its stance…

…as if preparing to step.

The word LOOKING stayed on the sonar screen longer than it should have.

Five seconds.
Ten.

Sonar doesn’t do that. It refreshes. It scrolls. It replaces old data with new.

This didn’t move.

It just sat there, glowing faintly green, like the system itself was holding its breath.

Then the screen went blank.

Not off.
Not dead.

Blank.

No depth.
No bottom.
No returns.

Just an empty grid.

The captain shut the engines down.

The sudden silence was worse than the noise. Without the hum, the ferry felt lighter — unanchored — like the only thing holding us in place had been the sound.

Passengers began to panic below deck. I could hear it now: confused voices, footsteps, someone crying. The ferry drifted, slow and helpless, the water lapping softly against the hull like a reassurance that meant nothing.

I grabbed the edge of the console to keep from shaking.

“We can’t stop here,” I whispered.

“We didn’t,” the captain said.

I stared at him.

“They did.”

The ferry shifted again.

Not a wave.

Not current.

A lift.

Barely noticeable — just enough that my stomach floated for a split second, like the beginning of a drop on a roller coaster.

I gagged.

The captain braced himself.

“Do you know why you’re afraid of deep water?” he asked quietly.

I shook my head.

“You think it’s because of drowning,” he continued. “Or not seeing the bottom. Or what might be down there.”

Another lift.

Stronger this time.

The metal groaned — long, deep, like something enormous was taking our weight carefully.

“But it’s not that,” he said. “It’s because your body knows something your mind refuses to accept.”

The sonar flickered back on.

One return.

Directly beneath us.

So close it might as well have been touching.

The shape wasn’t long anymore.

It wasn’t walking.

It was upright.

“Captain…” I choked.

“It’s standing,” he said.

The depth gauge began counting upward.

Not down.

Up.

Like the water was being pushed away from us.

Like the sea itself was making space.

“I told you,” he said softly. “They don’t live in the deep.”

The ferry rose another inch.

I felt the pressure in my ears, my chest, my bones. Like being slowly lifted by hands you never see.

The sonar flashed again.

Three returns reappeared — the walkers — now positioned farther out, spaced evenly, facing inward.

Watching.

Guarding.

The captain leaned close to me.

“Don’t look down,” he said.

Too late.

I pressed my forehead to the glass and stared into the water.

The surface didn’t ripple.

It didn’t break.

It thinned.

And for a moment — just one unbearable moment — I saw it.

Not clearly. Never clearly.

A suggestion of scale.
A darkness deeper than the night around it.
A shape too large to understand, too close to comprehend.

Not a creature.

A presence.

The kind of thing that doesn’t hunt — because hunting implies hunger.

This didn’t need anything.

It simply noticed us.

The ferry creaked again.

Then settled.

Gently.

Like it had been placed back down.

The engines restarted on their own.

The sonar cleared.

Depth returned to normal.

Eighty feet.

The walkers were gone.

The bottom was back.

The water outside looked exactly the same as it always had.

Passengers calmed. Conversations resumed. Laughter returned, thin and fragile.

I sank into my seat, shaking uncontrollably.

“What was that?” I whispered.

The captain didn’t answer right away.

Then he said:

“Why do you think the sea feels so big?”

I swallowed.

“Because it has to be,” he continued. “Some things don’t fit anywhere else.”

The ferry docked.

People disembarked, unaware they’d just been lifted by something older than charts, older than routes, older than fear.

I quit the job the next morning.

Couldn’t stand the sound of water after that. Couldn’t look at the horizon without feeling like it was looking back.

But sometimes, late at night, when I’m far inland and trying to sleep…

I feel it.

That gentle lift.

That careful pressure.

Like something beneath me is still pacing.

Still matching my speed.

Waiting for the moment I forget how shallow the ground really is.

Because the ocean isn’t scary because it’s deep.

It’s scary because it isn’t.

Not all the way down.

Not where it matters.

And some things down there?

1pn6rgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1pn6rgr/the_devils_dictionary_2026_edition_draft/,The Devil’s Dictionary 2026 Edition (draft),"Hi looking for some feedback on this draft of an idea I had to continue the works of Ambrose Bierce’s The Devils Dictionary:

The Devil’s Dictionary: 2026 Edition

Introduction

In 1906, Ambrose Bierce offered the world The Devil’s Dictionary, a work that turned language upon itself, exposing the hypocrisies, absurdities, and contradictions of human nature with wit, cynicism, and relentless precision.

This 2026 Edition continues that tradition, observing the peculiarities of the modern age with the same sharp lens of satire. Here, words, behaviors, technologies, and obsessions are subjected to unflinching scrutiny. From the petty cruelties of human society to the absurdities of our diets, digital habits, and self-inflicted anxieties, nothing escapes the gaze of this dictionary.

Each entry is offered in homage to Bierce’s style: concise, witty, and occasionally extended for emphasis. Where Bierce illuminated the world of his time, these pages aim to illuminate ours—often cruel, often ridiculous, always human.

May you find, within, both recognition and amusement, and perhaps a shadow of truth you had hoped to ignore.

Started building this automation 6 weeks ago after realizing I was spending 4 hours weekly manually checking research papers across three academic platforms. Knew there had to be a better way.  
  
  
THE JOURNEY:  
  
  
Week 1 was research and planning. Looked at different academic APIs. ArXiv has good coverage but misses papers from other sources. Google Scholar has everything but rate limits are tough. Semantic Scholar has great metadata. Decided to use all three for comprehensive coverage.  
  
  
Week 2 built the core search functionality. Got multi-platform queries working with proper filters for year and keywords. Initial version just dumped everything to a file. Quickly realized I needed better filtering and organization.  
  
  
Week 3 focused on data quality. Some papers have abstracts some don't. Some have PDFs some are paywalls. Built validation logic to ensure papers have complete metadata before saving. Added console logging to track what gets filtered and why.  
  
  
Week 4 added database integration. Chose Notion because it handles rich text and URLs well. Mapped all the metadata fields including DOI citations authors abstract references count. Took forever to get the property mappings right with n8n expressions.  
  
  
Week 5 built the digest functionality. Started with basic Slack messages. Improved formatting to include paper titles and clickable links. Added empty results handling so it doesn't fail on slow news days.  
  
  
Week 6 was refinement and testing. Ran it daily for two weeks to validate accuracy. Adjusted search keywords to get better relevance. Fine tuned the limit to 5 papers per day which feels manageable.  
  
  
CHALLENGES FACED:  
  
  
Biggest struggle was handling inconsistent data across platforms. ArXiv uses one format. Google Scholar uses another. Semantic Scholar has different field names. Solution was normalizing everything in the validation step.  
  
  
Second challenge was rate limiting. Google Scholar gets aggressive if you query too often. Fixed by spacing out requests and using reasonable limits. 50 papers per search gives good coverage without hitting limits.  
  
  
Third issue was Notion API complexity. The property mapping syntax is weird and errors are cryptic. Solved by testing each field individually and building up the complete mapping incrementally.  
  
  
TECHNICAL DECISIONS:  
  
  
Chose n8n because it has native nodes for academic search Notion and Slack. Could have used Make or Zapier but n8n handles complex data transformations better.  
  
  
Went with Notion instead of Airtable because the team already uses Notion for documentation. Made sense to keep research in the same ecosystem.  
  
  
Set digest time to 8 AM because that's when I start work. Morning coffee plus research digest is a good routine.  
  
  
COSTS AND TOOLS:  
  
  
n8n: Free self-hosted on DigitalOcean at 12 dollars monthly  
Academic APIs: Free tier sufficient for daily searches  
Notion: Already had it for documentation  
Slack: Already had workspace  
Total monthly cost: 12 dollars  
  
  
RESULTS AFTER 5 WEEKS LIVE:  
  
  
Research time: 4 hours to zero manual effort weekly  
Papers tracked: 175 total across 35 days  
Database: Searchable with full citations  
Morning routine: Wake up to curated digest  
Research anxiety: Gone completely  
  
  
CURRENT STATE:  
  
  
Workflow runs reliably every morning. Never miss important publications. Research database growing daily. Team members asking for similar workflows for their topics.  
  
  
WHAT ID DO DIFFERENTLY:  
  
  
Should have started with all three platforms instead of trying ArXiv alone first. Would have saved two weeks of iteration.  
  
  
Would have documented the Notion property mappings better from day one. Came back after a week and couldn't remember the field structure.  
  
  
Should have added more logging earlier. When things broke it was hard to debug without visibility into the data flow.  
  
  
WHATS NEXT:  
  
  
Adding email digest as alternative to Slack. Building topic-specific searches for team members. Exploring citation network analysis to find related papers automatically.

I’m new to this coffee community and I need some advice. I was considering the Sage Bambino Plus, which costs around €450 here in Romania. In my opinion, that's a bit pricey for what it offers.

I’m also thinking about the Sage Barista Pro at €640. I need something reliable because I don't want to buy another machine for the next 5 years.

In short, I'm looking for a machine that is:

* Reliable
* Capable of professional results (I want to learn everything about coffee)
* User-friendly (though this is not strictly necessary)
* Size doesn't matter (I have plenty of counter space)
* I am open to other suggestions as well! If you know of a better machine in this budget (around 400€-650€), please let me know.

Gavin Harrison is a drumming hero of mine, and meeting him showed me what a genuinely nice person he is.
Working at a coffee shop, struggling with English, I'd lost momentum with drumming after selling my gear to move to the UK.
Then he walked in, and I stuttered, ""G-gavin Harrison?"" His smile suggested he wasn't expecting recognition.
Despite my poor English, we chatted, and I gifted him a coffee.
Later, he came back, surprised me with a Porcupine Tree album, and we took a photo.
This brief encounter sort of rekindled my drumming passion, even stronger than before.
I often wonder if he still visits that coffee shop or recalls our meeting, which remains to me a treasured memory.

1pn6mg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pn6mg0/how_do_i_bring_up_my_dates_messy_apartment/,How do I bring up my date’s messy apartment without sounding judgmental?,"I’ve been seeing a guy (late 20s) for about two months. He’s genuinely kind, funny, remembers little things I say, and he’s been consistant about showing up. The problem is his place. The first time I went over, I told myself it was a “bad week” situation. There were piles of clothes on the couch and floor, dishes stacked in the sink, and a pretty strong smell like old food and maybe cat litter. I didn’t say anything, we watched a movie, I left. Second time, same, maybe worse. There were takeout containers on the coffee table with dried sauce, a sticky spot on the kitchen counter, and I had to move stuff off a chair just to sit down. The bathroom had a ring in the toilet and the towel looked like it had been used for a month. I know this sounds harsh but I’m trying to be accurate. I grew up in a house where “company clean” was a big deal, so I’m aware I might be more sensitive than average, but this feels past “a little clutter.” It makes it hard to relax, and I find myself getting grossed out and then feeling guilty for being grossed out.

What makes it tricky: he is not defensive in general. He’s open about other things, he talks about therapy and mental health casually, he doesn’t do macho posturing. He works long hours and has a commute, so I get being tired. But he also invites me over like it’s normal, like he’s proud of his place, which confuses me. I don’t want to “parent” him or become the girlfriend who cleans his apartment. I also don’t want to stop going over and then have him feel rejected with no clue why. We’re not official-official but it’s heading that way, and I don’t want to build resentment early. Another detail: he has a cat, and I think the litter box is part of the smell, but I’m not 100% sure, and I really don’t want to be the person who criticizes someone’s pet care. I’ve tried small hints like “want to come to my place instead?” or “we can grab dinner out” and he’s fine with that, but he still suggests his place a lot. I also offered once to cook at his place, and he said yes, then we got there and the kitchen was so chaotic I ended up ordering in instead, which felt awkard. I keep replaying it like, am I shallow? Is this a dealbreaker? Or is it something you can talk about kindly and move on.

How do you bring this up in a way that’s direct but not mean? Do I frame it as “I have a hard time being in messy spaces” or do I just say “your apartment is kinda gross”? Also, if he reacts badly, is that my answer right there? I’d love practical phrasing and boundaries, because I don’t want to pretend it’s fine when it’s not.

I nearly doubled my body weight by using food as a coping mechanism. Developed pre-diabetes in 2021 and got up to 330lbs. Reversed the pre-diabetes in December 2021. 

I lost my first 20lbs by not ordering food delivery anymore.

I lost the next 20lbs by checking into a camp in Carlsbad, CA. But I yoyo’d from December 2021 to July 2025. 

I lost the next 10lbs by volunteering as a counselor at summer camp this July. 

And I’ve lost the next 40ish by taking my nutrition and exercise seriously again (started 9.18.25). 

I eat a piece of fruit at 11am and 7pm almost every day. I have a meal at noon and 6pm that consists of 4-6oz of lean meat and veggies. At 3pm I have vegetables, soup, or a smoothie made from water, fruits and veggies. 

I got a little too hyper-fixated on the scale so I stopped weighing myself every morning. I also started working on my conditioning. I feel much better and happier.

• I gave up tobacco/nicotine 11.17.23

• I gave up energy drinks 5.12.23

• I only drink water and black coffee/cold brew for the most part

1pn6i6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1pn6i6h/we_tried_nervolink_this_mushroompowered_blend/,"We Tried NervoLink 🍄 This Mushroom-Powered Blend Targets Tingling, Burning, and Nerve Pain Naturally","# 🌿 Full NervoLink Review ...

If your feet feel like they're auditioning for a tap dance you didn’t sign up for, you’re not alone. **Nerve pain** messes with everything — from sleep to sanity.

It’s hard to stay upbeat when **tingling and numbness** steal the show during your morning walk. And let’s not even talk about the frustration when nothing you try seems to work.

I’ve watched a lot of friends try *everything* — heat packs, cold packs, foot rollers, potions — and still come up short. That’s where [NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) walked in (pun intended).

# 🧾 Product Overview

* **Product Name:** NervoLink
* **Category:** Nerve Support Supplements 🡒 Mushroom-Based Nerve Formulas
* **Overall Verdict:** 4.9/5

# 🍄 What Is NervoLink and How Does It Work?

NervoLink is a **plant-based supplement** with a special focus on mushrooms. Not the pizza kind — the medicinal kind used for **natural nerve pain relief**.

It includes **lion’s mane**, **reishi**, **shiitake**, and **cordyceps** — each one offering a different angle to help with **nerve damage recovery** and discomfort.

This formula is a great option for those trying **mushroom stacks that may ease nerve pain** without synthetic chemicals or harsh side effects.

If you’ve been considering **using mushrooms for natural nerve pain relief**, this blend makes it easy to try several in one capsule.

# 💬 Alyssa's Personal Experience With NervoLink

My friend **Alyssa**, a yoga instructor I met during a plant-based wellness retreat in Santa Barbara, has been dealing with nerve pain on and off for years — especially in her feet.

Between barefoot beach flows and long sessions on hard floors, her nerves were constantly aggravated. She described it like “needles doing salsa on my soles.” Ouch.

A few months ago, during one of our post-practice smoothie chats, she mentioned she was fed up with synthetic nerve meds that left her foggy.

I told her [about NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) after reading up on its ingredients — I figured if anyone would appreciate a **mushroom supplement for nervous system health**, it’d be Alyssa.

She gave it a shot and texted me about 10 days in saying, “Wait… my feet aren’t buzzing today?”

By week three, she was back to holding longer tree poses without wincing. She said the formula made her feel “calmer from the inside out,” which honestly sounds exactly like her.

One minor complaint? She wasn’t thrilled about the capsule size. Said it reminded her of swallowing a mini yoga block. 😅 But she stuck with it and hasn’t looked back.

Seeing her walk comfortably through a full moon hike last month — barefoot, of course — totally sold me on the power of **natural remedies that help with nerve damage**.

She still takes it daily and swears it’s been a major part of her healing routine.

# 🔬 Key Ingredients & Their Benefits

**Lion’s mane** helps promote growth of new nerve cells and is often rated as the **best mushroom for nerve regeneration supplements** \- and for good reason.

**Reishi** supports nerve relaxation and is great for people dealing with high stress or tension that flares up nerve symptoms.

**Shiitake mushrooms**, aside from being delicious, are known for their role in **supporting the nervous system** and reducing inflammation.

**Cordyceps** helps increase ATP production — that’s cellular energy — making it helpful in **supporting nerve repair** and overall vitality.

Combining these with B-vitamins and minerals makes [NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) a **top-rated natural supplement for neuropathy**, all in one bottle.

This **organic supplement for nerve support** reportedly works gently and effectively.

# 📢 What Real Users Are Saying

Across health forums and Amazon reviews, people are praising this product for delivering actual relief without harsh side effects.

Users with diabetic nerve issues said NervoLink helped them sleep better by easing the nightly foot tingles. Others called it a “calm in a capsule.”

There were a few notes about mild bloating — mostly when people took it without food. So maybe don’t down it with just black coffee.

Some also mentioned delays from third-party sellers. If you’re wondering **where NervoLink can be purchased safely**, stick with the official site.

It’s also where you’ll find real **user testimonials** and the **money-back guarantee**, which brings peace of mind when trying something new.

# 🕒 How to Take NervoLink (Dosage & Tips)

Two capsules a day is all it takes. No strange powders, no weird rituals. Just pop them with breakfast and get on with your life.

If you’re curious about **how mushroom complexes support nerve health**, consistency is key. Give it a few weeks for the full effect.

Some people feel a difference faster. For others, it's more of a gradual shift. Either way, no crash, no jitters — just gentle support.

# ⚠️ Safety, Side Effects & Interactions

Most folks tolerate it well. The mushrooms are familiar to those who take [natural remedies](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) **that help with nerve damage** or immune issues.

No stimulants, gluten, soy, or dairy make it friendly for those with dietary sensitivities. Always smart to check labels though.

If you're already taking meds, especially for chronic conditions, check with your doctor. It’s always good to stay on the safe side.

# ⚖️ How It Compares to Other Supplements

Most nerve support formulas rely heavily on B12 and skip the **mushroom-based ingredients** entirely. That’s where NervoLink shines.

It brings together both sides of the nerve support world — classic vitamins and **anti-inflammatory mushrooms used for nerve issues**.

It also saves you from buying five different bottles of supplements. This **organic mushroom blend for neuropathy support** makes things simple.

It's a punchy supp that takes a full-body approach without getting complicated or clinical.

# 💲 Pricing Options

Here’s what you’re looking at:

* **1 bottle:** $69
* **3 bottles:** $59 each
* **6 bottles:** $49 each Free U.S. shipping on the bigger bundles, which helps if you’re in it for the long run.

It’s solid value for a product that gives you an entire **mushroom complex for nerve support** without buying them all separately.

# 🛒 Where To Buy NervoLink

Only trust [the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official). That’s where you’ll find authentic stock, accurate ingredient info, and their 60-day return policy.

There have been reports of knockoffs online, and those shady sellers don’t offer refunds. So yeah — better safe than sorry.

It worked like a charm! Thanks to that and the exceptional sunny weather we had, I felt great all weekend, walked around a lot, talked a lot, and all around had a lot of fun. It had been so long since I'd felt like that. 

And now today... It's back to the same old daily pain, brain fog, and fatigue. I'm feeling jealous of people who feel like I did this weekend every single day. No wonder I have so much trouble keeping up with adult life.

I woke up this morning with rare motivation.

Not change my life motivation just enough to clean one thing. I decided on the kitchen. One task. Ten minutes. In and out.

I picked up a cup from the counter and noticed it was sticky. That felt wrong. Cups shouldn’t be sticky. So I rinsed it, which reminded me the sink was full, which reminded me the dishwasher was clean.

I opened the dishwasher. Something smelled warm.

Apparently, at some point in the past, I had placed a single spoon inside, then ran the dishwasher, then forgotten about it. The spoon had been steam-aging alone like fine cutlery.

While putting it away, I opened the utensil drawer and discovered chaos. Forks mixed with spoons. A whisk living where knives should be. Absolute anarchy.

So I fixed it.

Which meant taking everything out.

Which meant wiping the drawer.

Which meant noticing crumbs.

Which meant asking myself how crumbs get *inside* a closed drawer.

Ten minutes had passed. I was sweating. My coffee was cold. I was holding a whisk and questioning my life choices.

The kitchen was now worse than when I started.

I gave up, sat down, and ordered food delivery from a restaurant five minutes away.

### Training
I'm a 37M, started distance running about 2 years ago. 2024 I ran about 1000km total. This year I've taken it more seriously, running 3000km to date. My marathon PB was set in Paris in April of this year. This was my second marathon and my first with proper training etc. After April, I recovered and re-entered marathon training with the aim of sub 3 in Tallinn in Sept but was derailed with a non- running injury about 6 weeks out. I still completed Tallinn in 3h18 before entering the training block for Valencia. There were 12 weeks between the marathons, so my plan was 2 weeks recovery, 8 weeks of training then 2 weeks of taper. 

For the 8 weeks I averaged around 85km/week with a couple of weeks just over 100km. The focus was on longer runs to target strength endurance and threshold. It was a self modified Norwegian Singles plan. I did 0 VO2 Max sessions (nothing faster than about 10k pace) in this block.

My weeks structure: 
Mon = easy, 25-40 mins 
Tues = sub threshold (usually 8-10*3 mins) 
Wed = easy MLR (approx 1h45 at HR<140, 5min/km)
Thurs = sub threshold (usually 4-5*6 mins)
Fri = rest/ recovery 30 mins
Sat = MP intervals, started at 4*10 mins, up to about 4x20 mins/5k
Sun = hilly long run, usually easy run pace (between 2 and 3 hrs, only 1 run at >32km; 36km/3hrs 3 weeks out)

I've tried Pfitz styled long runs or MP efforts at the end of long runs but often that's too hard in this NSA styled training where you have a reasonable amount of fatigue at any point. Instead, this block I did some fartlek styled long runs (eg 1k @MP, 1k float @around 90% MP repeating for 15-24km). This was similar to Dan Nash's workouts for those that listen to him (reduced volume as I run a lot less lol). This usually meant I would only need to reduce the volume or skip one sub threshold session the week after and rarely felt like I was on the border of injury! 

Training block highlights: 
New half marathon PB (from 1h29 to 1h24), 4 weeks out 
2x10km at GMP with 1km float (Strava gave a half marathon time of 1h28 for this session), 2.5 weeks out

As I entered the taper I felt confident of sub 3 and was hoping that with perfect conditions 2h56/57 could be on the cards.

### Pre-race
Flew into Madrid from the UK Friday evening. Due to Ryanair (flight delays/ baggage issues etc) almost missed our late train from Madrid to Valencia. Arrived in Valencia at 11:30pm Friday. Pizza for dinner to maintain the carb load (and restaurants were starting to shut). Checked in to a hotel around 1am with a mate, I hardly slept (as is normal for me before a marathon). 

Up at 0830 Saturday for a shake out, ran through the old riverbed in Valencia to the finish line of the marathon. Everyone else had the same idea, we saw at least 5,000 runners! The most famous was Jess Stenson, calling out split times to her group of training partners (she is now the Aussie female marathon record holder). After about 3 hours getting our race bibs etc, we needed to rest. Grabbed hasta la pasta and went back to the hotel where I watched a bluey (kids cartoon) marathon and missed my 6, 4 and 2 year old's that were at home for this race. Valencian paella for dinner followed by another sleepless night!

Race day morning I was up at 0530, well before my alarm as usual. 2x coffee (my first caffeine in a week) and a simple breakfast (toast, muesli, orange juice and a local sports drink 500mL). Due to no bag drop unless you pre booked, we left the hotel in our race kit, with no additional layers and jog/walked the 3km to the start line. Luckily it was 15 degrees, much warmer than any day in the UK for the prior 3 weeks - and the sun was yet to rise in Valencia!

### Race
I was starting in the 3:00 - 3:12 group as everyone needs to submit a time for start wave seeding. This is known as one of the fastest marathons in the world and it was full of what looked like seasoned runners with the aim to pb. There were close to 40,000 runners and around 6,000 went sub 3 hrs! I was expecting this to mean the start would be a bit congested but I was surprised to find that the congestion continued for the better part of 5km and it was still crowded, particularly around the corners for most of the race. The plan due to the predicted heat (around 21 degrees at the finish line for me) was to try and split halfway in 1h29 flat.

It felt warm but not too hot through the first 10km, I focused on staying hydrated (bottled water at every drink station was great) and getting some carbs in. Effort felt ok but not as easy as I'd hoped. I decided not to try and make up the seconds lost due to congestion in the start just yet. At 15km after tipping part of a third bottle over my head to stay cool, I realised my bib number had torn off one of its corners, a problem I later found impacted a lot of runners. I slowed to repin the bib but was still feeling good and was able to make up the time easily.

I went through halfway at approx 1:29:30 and was a little worried at how hard the effort felt. I had a bit of pain/tightness in my left hip flexor but aerobically it still felt pretty comfortable. I decided to focus on a slightly higher cadence to see if that would help out my quads/hip flexors. Around 23km we were caught by the 3hr pace group which was a bit concerning; however, our pace felt consistent and was confirmed with the next 5km split. At 25km I decided the 3hr pace group was too crowded and that I was still feeling good enough to push a bit more. I also noticed my bib number had come free again, this time from two corners and was at risk of falling onto the ground completely. I decided to tear the bib off and put it in my gel pocket and hope for the best. I picked it up and settled into around 4:10/km. It was around this time when the sun was starting to get pretty hot as well. 

My fuelling strategy was precision gels with a total of 210g of carbs + 100mg caffeine that I finished by the 2h15 mark. I had the on course gels in my pocket as a back up but felt as though that would be enough to get me through to the finish.

At about 32km I suddenly hit a bad patch and, in hindsight, I had probably pushed a bit too hard over the last few kms. I tried to hold onto 4:15/km (sub 3 pace) but couldn't do it. Strava has my 34th km at 4:26. During this period, I was watching my mate pull further and further away. At 35km, he was about 80m up the road and I could just see his hat in between other runners sporadically. I thought at this point that sub 3 was gone but I refused to give up just yet, the road tilted downhill slightly, I thought of my kids and training in the cold and dark back in the UK. I decided to roll the dice one last time and pushed my pace down to about 4:06-4:08/km, I managed to hold this effort until about the 39km mark as I caught back up to my mate. 

Unfortunately, that effort tipped me over the edge and the rest of the race was just trying to keep going while calculating splits in my head. At 40km, I had 10 mins to make the finish line, I thought it would be enough, but I was struggling to hold 4:18/km by now. At 500m to go, my shoelace came undone and I knew that if I stopped I would struggle to start again. Valencia has a large downhill from about 450m to go then onto the last 200 metres which is a flat stretch out over the water to the finish line. Somehow I managed to run down that hill without tripping on my lace or having my legs cramp up completely. As I ran through the line, I took my bib out of my pocket in one hand and crossed the line with my mate on the other side. Joy, relief, pride and fatigue washed over me, what a great feeling.

### Post-race
I'm not sure the 2km+ walk past the finish line was super necessary! Valencia is a beautiful city and it was great to sit in the 24 degrees sunshine in winter while enjoying an Aperol Spritz. I did feel for the 4+ hour marathon finishers that were still out there in that heat!

### Future Goals
I'm pretty keen to test the limits of my body by chasing a marathon PB, especially before I hit 40/ while I can. I'll have managed around 3200km/2000 miles by the end of 2025 and I think I can fit in enough training to increase that again for 2026. So, I've set my first target of 1000 miles between Valencia marathon and London 2026 in April. 

Thank you for all those who have managed to read to this point. Any advise or specific recommendations on how to make the jump from a 3hr marathon runner to 2h45 or faster would be appreciated. For those who can, there's also a link for Children with Cancer UK who I'll be trying to fundraise for London 2026 - https://2026tcslondonmarathon.enthuse.com/pf/reece-cordy 

Finally, anyone who wants to follow along on Strava, feel free - every run is recorded there.

1pn66sm,https://i.redd.it/0e08m47z2d7g1.jpeg,‘He’s living his best life’: drunk raccoon hit DMV for snacks before liquor store (Continuing Coverage),"This party animal won’t quit!

The drunk raccoon that went viral for guzzling whiskey then passing out by a toilet at a Virginia liquor store is a serial offender who has broken into at least three buildings — and lived to tell the tail, er, tale.

The half-cocked critter, who tickled America’s funny bone last week, has long been ransacking other businesses near the Ashland store in search of goodies, according to the cop who nabbed him.

“This is not the first time he’s been in one of the buildings,”  Animal Protection Officer Samantha Martin said Thursday.

“This is the third break-in he’s had. He was in the karate studio — I think he got into the DMV \[and\] ate some of their snacks one time,” Martin said on the podcast Hear In Hanover.

The drunk-as-a-skunk furball spent the night sobering up and was released near the Ashland ABC Store, where he left a trail of broken whiskey and gin bottles on Black Friday.

“We don’t relocate him, because that’s a death sentence for raccoons,” Martin said. “But somehow he knows how to get back in this building. He’s a smart little critter!”

The four-legged boozehound went viral last week, inspiring t-shirts, coffee mugs — and even signature cocktails such as the “Trash Panda Old Fashioned” and the “Midnight Masked Gin Fizz.”

Ultimately, Martin hopes it will be the blotto bandit’s last burglary.

“I hope he learned his lesson,” she said. “But I just say, ‘Enjoy your life.’ I think he’s living his best life — and why not? Have a drink or two, especially on Black Friday.”

1pn66rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/1pn66rf/how_many_times_have_you_been_dnrd/,How many times have you been DNRd?,"I'm embarrassed at how many times I've been DNRd from a facility- I get agency they'll DNR you without a care in the world with no reason but it's been 9 times for me over 3 years since I started traveling :/

I've looked back and just- I feel like all but 2 were genuinely my fault? And I know it doesn't sound believable. I've been doing this for 7-8 years though, I love and care about what I do. In my opinion and experience, it's the people you work with that make this job harder than it is. I feel like a lot of people could agree with that, ESPECIALLY those who are also in healthcare. Teamwork is 100% of this job, and for me I recognize mistakes when I make them, I take accountability, and respect it's my responsibility to fix those mistakes so that both the people I work with and the people I take care of can rely on me 

I don't take 9 DNRs lightly - I literally have questioned ""at this point is it me???"" - and tell me if you feel like it is. I feel that a lot of these DNRs have been because of drama and other people and just a bunch of other bullshit and I just want a break :/ 

First time I ever got DNRd was my first contract. The scheduler extended my contract and some other CNAs then immediately DNRd all of us. I found out the she had been lying to the DNS (whom i had never met the 3 months I was there). I overheard the both of them on the phone and the DNS was like ""I thought you didn't like her you just told me to DNR her"" - I thought me and the scheduler had a good relationship?? We literally would get each other coffee and shit? Sure that doesn't make you automatic friends but make it make sense. Found out later scheduler threw her coffee at the DNS's car when they fired her because they found out all the drama she was making up and had the facility 28k in debt and she was doing time card fraud. I also had a friend I worked with there tell me the DNS moved facilities and asked her to ask me if I wanted to come work at the new facility she moved to (absolutely not).

Second time I was DNRd I was 1 week away from finishing my contract and a nurse who idefk why she had a problem with me my first interaction with her was her slamming a cup down next to me saying a resident needed water. Did she *pass by the water station* on her way to this? Yes, yes she did. She would also leave resident's briefs open/exposed then spend god knows how long looking for me to tell me to change them even though I would be in the middle of my rounds. I just dealt with her by just doing things her way because it wasn't worth arguing with her, she was staff. Agency you can't say shit or advocate for yourself and this is where I learned that. One night (when shit hit the fan), she came down to my nurse's station that was on the opposite side of the building ((: and went off on me saying that me and my coworker left in the building alone for an hour. 

We both let her know we were going outside to grab something real quick, gone 2 minutes max. Hell the parking lot was RIGHT outside the door. And why am I the only one being yelled at? She would also spend the whole shift outside with her dogs without telling us when she was stepping out so having to look in the building and outside to find her to tell her resident's needed medications I guess didn't matter lol 

Her and my coworker got in a screaming match, then the nurse started trying to tell a resident ""they hit you didn't they?"" Like full on manipulation bro we were like what the fuck. I wrote a statement, covered for my co worker about the screaming match (my co worker also denied it). The part I fucked up on was explaining how the nurse had been on me since day one and including my feelings which = drama which = facility doesn't want to deal with it which = DNR. That nurse ended up getting fired later on, lol and my co worker ended up working there as staff, she told me the scheduler wishes she could have me back but the facility won't budge. 

The third time I got DNRd this med aide decided to do my entire final rounds for me. I liked to do mine around 5am an hour before shift change, she went and started them at 4:30  so it looked like I didn't do anything (((: I was helping other people with their rounds when she did all this so when I had to give report I couldn't even give times of when my people were changed because then she just disappeared and then complained 

Third time I was DNRd I was with my ex, he decided to hop on the agency grind with me to travel together. It was fun, I had already been living in hotels and just hopping around going all over. The facility I was at was nice and I was there for months already before we got together. One day I asked him to get our time cards signed and send them in (my agency knew we were together) -though normally I was usually the one to send them in.

**Tell me why this man put his mother's signature on my time card, and his, and then wrote a** ***clearly false name*** **on the main signature line. We both got DNRd because my time card included one of his mom's signatures. Yeah I was pissed, the lack of fucking common sense was outstanding.** 

  
The 4th time I got DNRd was also because of my ex (yes i know), and him putting extra time on his time card. I got the girlfriend association DNR. Should I have checked his time cards? Yeah probably. Thought he understood after I was pissed the first time (nope) 

The 5th time I was DNRd I actually DNRd *myself*. Way too long to explain, but I was there for over a year and they had to fill in like 100 of my shifts lol - even the staff was mad I left 

The 6th time I was DNRd was actually the same facility again (#4 they had let me come back and not my ex) - new management, terrible, they were DNRing people if you didn't have a name badge on. I would wake up at 2:45am to get there at 6 to help cover shifts. I come in one morning and I wasn't on the schedule and they were like oh well and didn't care. So I just said hey if you can, just please let me know / can we communicate directly (instead of through my agency, which I had done before)  since I wake up at etc etc etc. Lol DNRd. They tried to say I had attitude and was screaming and yelling. 

((((: 

I swear to god ya'll I'm not stupid, I knew how strict they were hell everyone gets a heads up how terrible the new management is. Being agency is a gamble when it comes to work and this place was easy and my favorite co worker was working with me and the hours were perfect why in the ever loving FUCK would I jeopardize working there. How the fuck is someone supposed to know asking/figuring out better communication RESPECTFULLY gets you DNRd? Oh and the facility lying - this is a very, VERY big bullshit thing that pisses me off the fucking most. My agency knows me and always has my back, but when a facility lies my agency just literally can't do anything. I've explained misunderstandings (coming up) and even when my agency is able to PROVE shit the facility can still just be like nope fuck you even though you caught us lying. 

My 7th time being DNRd my god this list is long but this one was actually my fault. I was working there for a hot minute loved it and then one day I was on my phone a little too much and got DNRd. I would always have all my shit done when I was on my phone but yes I know shouldn't have been on it even during downtime. 

My 8th time being DNRd and I actually just now found out the reason why - they said I didn't write down my changes...even though me and the girl I was with did all of our rounds together...and have never wrote down our changes...and she didn't get DNRd lol. When I first found out I had just woken up and saw I was DNRd with no explanation even though they'd reach out to me first to cover/literally asked me to work the day before. 

My 9th time being DNRd this bitch who 1. is known for getting people fired and 2. i thought me and her were good nope. She tried to say I refused to take someone to the bathroom - when I tell you I thought about the entire shift trying to think of wtf they were talking about I realized she twisted the context of it. Resident wanted to use the bathroom and she was both cont/inc - so I always ask if they felt like they've already went a little before I transfer them so I don't get covered in shit/piss when I stand them up lol the fuck. She went and said that I told the resident I wasn't going to take them to the bathroom since they've already soiled themselves. This bitch watched me transfer the resident to the bathroom and everything too but that's staff word against agency's for ya

Anyways, yeah I'm embarrassed about the number of times i've been DNRd but literally how much of this is even my fault bro I can't win",3,1765801842.0,cna,12,0.64,False

The kid was accompanied by her mom. Nung nadinig nila yung bato hitting the screen they immediately went to my area to find out what happened. Fast forward to us going to the police station to file an incident report detailing what happened. She acknowledged the report and left her details with me/the police.

Problem ko now is need ko magpa-quote sa authorized service center kasi gusto kong resolution is maayos yung laptop back to the state it was before mabasag.
