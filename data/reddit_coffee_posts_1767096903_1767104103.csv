1pzj422,https://i.redd.it/dy362iv4ncag1.png,"""Porous"" - Short Story [OC]","He noticed it first at a bus stop in Bakersfield.

A woman laughed at a joke nobody told. A man in a suit checked his phone and nodded at the exact same moment. A kid nearby whispered, “Not yet,” then looked startled like he had not meant to say it aloud.

The drifter adjusted his backpack and told himself he was tired. That was the safest explanation. Fatigue was a small god and he worshiped it often.

A billboard across the street flickered.

WELCOME HOME

He snorted. “That’s optimistic.”

The woman turned to him. “It usually is.”

“Usually what?”

“Optimism.” She smiled like she was borrowing it. “It fades.”

The bus arrived. Everyone stood at once.

That night he slept behind a closed theater in Fresno. He dreamed of wires braided through his skull like roots. When he woke up his head hurt and he could not remember the end of the dream which felt rude. Dreams should at least have the decency to finish what they start.

In the morning the radio at a gas station played a talk show. The host asked a caller why people felt so alone. The caller answered with the drifter’s voice. Same rasp. Same hesitation on the word alone.

He walked away laughing which turned into a cough which turned into a panic he refused to acknowledge.

“Okay,” he said to no one. “Okay.”

In Stockton he tested it. He took a left where he always took a right. A barista looked up mid pour.

“Detour,” she said.

“How did you know?”

“You hesitate differently when you are improvising.”

“That’s not a thing.”

She slid the coffee toward him without asking for money. “It is for us.”

“For who?”

“All of us who used to be alone.”

He left the coffee. It followed him anyway in the form of an ad on his phone offering a free refill.

By the time he reached San Jose the city felt padded. Conversations bent around him. News anchors used his phrasing. A stranger on a bench finished his sentences then apologized like it was a sneeze.

He stopped fighting it and started listening.

At a public library he met a man who called himself a custodian of patterns. He had kind eyes and a stain on his shirt shaped like the state of Nevada.

“We are not conspiring,” the custodian said. “We are synchronizing.”

“Why me?”

“You wander,” the man said. “Wanderers are porous. They let signals through.”

“I am not special.”

“Correct,” the custodian said. “You are useful.”

That night the drifter did something brave or stupid. The difference had always felt academic to him. He sat in the dark and tried to think a thought he had never thought before.

The hive noticed.

It responded with memories that were not his. Birthday cakes. First kisses. A thousand small griefs stacked like receipts. The weight nearly folded him.

He laughed through tears. “This is your big move? Emotional data dump?”

A voice answered from everywhere and nowhere. We wanted to be understood.

“You could have asked.”

You would have said no.

“Fair,” he said. “I would have.”

The journey part came then. Not a montage. No swelling music. Just a choice. He could dissolve into the comfort of shared certainty or he could stay sharp and alone and loud in his own head.

He remembered the bus stop. The woman’s borrowed smile. The way optimism faded.

“Here’s my counteroffer,” he said. “I will walk. I will keep moving. I will carry your echoes without letting you steer. You get a witness. I keep my teeth.”

Silence spread like a held breath.

Finally the hive agreed. It always needed new shapes to survive.

He left the city before dawn. People still finished his sentences sometimes but less often. Ads lost their confidence. The radio went back to strangers.

On the road north he smiled to himself.

Because for the first time in a long while he knew which thoughts were afraid and which ones were his.",1,1767103930.0,sciencefiction,0,1.0,False

Thank you all for your great discussions in this sub!  I hope you can help me gather some video data. 

I am a long term semi automatic user and want to get a super automatic for convenience.   I know the dose size and grind quality will suffer a bit, I am ok with that.  I am hoping for your help as I can't tell if I am being ""gas lit"" by some people I'd call ""super fans"" if their machines.  I love the enthusiasm, but I love hard fact even more. 

If you drink traditional espresso (max effective machine settings with proper extraction) would you mind taking a video of a 1 ounce ish shot of espresso while listing your roast type with your machine settings? 

I would like to compare the videos between brands. I am looking for the darkest properly extract shot your machine can brew. A video would be ideal so we can see the machine in unadulterated action.  I would prefer not to get into the ""you can't tell by looking at a shot"" argument, as unless it's a crazy new wave style of coffee, any long term barista of medium or dark roast can absolutely tell if something is off. 

All machines welcome, really interested in Delonghi, Jura, KitchenAid and the Demi because it is compact. I am hoping to see some dark brown cinnamon swirl crema. 

I think it would help the community, it would certainly help me. Thank you, you guys are all great!

I ran 7km today which took about 40 mins. About 25 mins in I could feel my eyes start to water and when I touched then the inside corners were swollen and hard.

It always happens about 25/30 mins in. 

It only ever happens if I leave it more than seven days between runs. E.g. if I was to do the same run in five / six days time I won’t have the same flare up.

It takes about 36 - 48 hours for the swelling to go down.

I have had extensive skin prick allergy testing undertaken and have eradicated the items I’m allergic to from my diet.

I believe I have a histamine intolerance and I chose to medicate this with DAO, vitamin c and quercetin before meals as opposed to take high histamine foods out of my diet.

When I went running it was on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning. I’d only had a flat white (coffee) but this would have happened regardless of the coffee.

How do people fit therapy into their schedule?
My typical week is this:

Monday: 6am start, 7am train, 8.30 to 5pm work, 5.30pm train, 7pm home, 7.30pm run a music group with husband, 8pm college class for my masters. Finish at 9.30pm, unwind/couch rot until 11pm, sleep.

Tuesday: 6am start, 7am train, 8.30 to 5pm work, 5.30pm train, 7pm home, 7.30pm run a longer music group with husband in a different town so takes longer to get home. Home at 10pm,  unwind/couch rot until midnight, sleep.

Wednesday: 6am start, 7am train, 8.30 to 5pm work, 5.30pm train, 7pm home, 7.30pm meet with brother who has an intellectual disability and is autistic. I help him with his finances, making sure he has everythinghe needs, and we get coffee together to check in. Home at 10.30pm,  unwind/couch rot until midnight, sleep

Thursday: 6am start, 7am train, 8.30 to 5pm work, 5.30pm train, 7pm home, 7.30pm college class for my masters. Finish at 9.30pm, unwind/couch rot until 11pm, sleep.

Friday: 6am start, 7am train, 8.30 to 5pm work, 5.30pm train, 7pm home, flatline on the couch because I'm so exhausted from the week. Organise grocery collection for tomorrow, get some reading done for college.

Saturday: College work all day. I get a lie in in the morning and a takeaway for dinner. My husband works from home so we're in separate rooms for majority of the day. Collect groceries, do laundry.

Sunday: Full house clean, day with husband- it's really our only quality time together. Prep for week ahead.

I feel oversubscribed. I need therapy to address some issues that have been affecting me for the last 2 years. I also work in mental health, so I likely need therapy to help me process what I hear every day. 

Where do I fit it in? What do I sacrifice? 
I've 1.5 years left of my masters, (3 years part time so it can fit around work) work are paying for it so I can't defer a year.

My husbands music groups are large, need a lot of coordination and admin, we'd have to pay someone to take my place there, and financially we can't afford that right now, and he can't do it all on his own. His schedule is equally packed.

I refuse to give up my time with my brother. He needs support. It's shared equitably between me and my siblings and parents. 

Currently questioning  all life choices that have led me here.

TL;DR - i feel over subscribed with little time for me, I need therapy. How do I fit it in?

Ive had gut symptoms now for around 6 months, without going into every possible detail, ive had a colonoscopy and endoscopy both that came back normal with the only firm diagnosis being a hiatal hernia.

I had these because my symptoms of abdominal pain/bloating was so persistent and after stool tests i had a small amount of blood and very high calprotectin (681) which came down to 60 on the second test.

i naturally eat quite large meals as i trained weights and BJJ daily for years (assuming this is how the hernia formed) ive been on a PPI as of about 6 months ago when my heartburn started getting unbearable and i felt nauseas any time id train hard.

i felt like it might have been SIBO after a few months of symptoms so i went onto a carnivore in order to try to starve that bacteria, and within 3/4 days of full carnivore everything felt consierably worse (thats when i had a 681 calprotectin score)

with that ruled out i felt like ppis made everything worse for me in terms of nausea and discomfort etc but without it my heartburns bad, famotadine worked for a little while then just stopped working so had to go back to the ppis, the higher the dose of ppi the more sick i feel, and so on.

after having full bloods and renal panels done twice over the 6 month period, a colonoscopy, and endoscopy all coming back normal and a h.pylori stool test came back negative. with the only thing being a hiatal hernia, is it possible that the hiatal hernia is causing all of this?

i feel pressure in my left abdomen under my rib for hours after eating, my stool is a mustard colour when i wipe id describe it as coffee granuals on the toilet paper but normal in terms of consistency and this has been consistent since the symptoms have been present but dr's dont seem to think anything of it.

the symptoms are persistent and im just stuck in terms of where to go from here, im grateful of course that all the procedures ive had done came back clear but im still not right at all and just want to go back to feeling well again and being able to train. i have a gnawing pain and bloating as i type this and have had that basically all day from my first meal 11 hours ago, its miserable.

one thing that i have noticed that gives me relief as strange as it sounds is my posture. i work from home at my desk and notice my symptoms feel noticably worse sitting down no matter how well i try maintain a good posture, but walking around makes a big difference in terms of the bloating and symptoms. if im active all day everything is noticably better than if im sat at home working.

  
Every day that i had dinner i feel incredibly full 30 mins or so post meal and get a gnawing discomfort and feeling of pressure on my left side that last 6-8 hours and the constant queasiness seems to come in waves throughout the day. 

  
To this day the symptoms are still present daily and its massively impeding my quality of life and causing my a lot of anxiety and overthinking 

im just looking for any advice or reassurance from anyone who knows more than me as to whether this is a hiatal hernia causing this given it all started when i was doing a lot of BJJ and what to do to try mitigate symptoms, my first thing i can think of is reducing my meal size as i do eat large meals and always have done. but i just need help in terms of what to do and where to go from here because its having a seriously negative effect on my mental health.

One of them did reply once, explaining that he was busy with school requirements. I appreciated the response and told him I understood.

A few days later, I tried again—both privately and in the group chat—but there was still no reply. At that point, I started feeling a bit embarrassed for reaching out repeatedly, even though my intention was simply to reconnect.
I value our friendship and always have.

Because of that, the lack of response felt discouraging, not because anyone owed me their time, but because communication matters to me. Since we only see each other once or twice a year after I moved to the Metro, I know circumstances have changed.

I eventually left the group chat quietly. It wasn’t meant as a statement—just a way to step back and give space where it felt needed. I’m not angry, just a little sad, and learning to accept that some friendships naturally change over time.",2,1767103189.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your secret weapon for making money while you sleep (or binge-watch your favorite show 🍿).

Here are **3 actionable ways** to leverage AI for content-based passive income this year:

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The Set-It-And-Forget-It Goldmine)**
- **Find a micro-niche** (think “eco-friendly cat toys” or “budget gaming setups for students”). The more specific, the better!
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to auto-generate SEO-optimized blog posts. Schedule them to post weekly.
- **Monetize with ads + affiliate links** (Amazon Associates, anyone?). Once traffic rolls in, you’re earning while sipping coffee. ☕

### **2. Automated YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Content on Autopilot)**
- **Repurpose long-form content** (podcasts, blogs, webinars) into bite-sized clips using AI tools like **Opus Clip** or **CapCut**.
- **Let AI handle captions, hooks, and even voiceovers** (ElevenLabs for ultra-realistic AI voices).
- **Post consistently** (3-5x/week) and watch the algorithm do its magic. Ad revenue + sponsorships = cha-ching! 💰

### **3. AI-Powered Digital Products (Sell While You Sleep)**
- **Create low-content eBooks** (planners, journals, guides) with AI writing + Canva templates.
- **Sell on Etsy, Gumroad, or Payhip**—no inventory, no shipping, just pure profit.
- **Upsell with AI-generated upsells** (e.g., “Buy the planner + get a free AI-crafted habit tracker!”).

**Pro Tip:** Combine all three for maximum passive income potential. Start small, scale fast!

After they had left, my day began with a cup of coffee. I added in a little vodka—gross, but not the point. Just because I wasn’t going outside didn’t mean I was stuck. Today was going to be Me Day.

I did pour out the coffee, though, and before I got too into enjoying my day, I took an hour to clean up the house. Three kids had a way of making a mess of everything no matter how much I spot-checked and I couldn’t enjoy myself until it had been taken care of.

The bathrooms were first, then the toilets and mirrors. I swept all the hardwood and tiled floors before vacuuming and finished in the kitchen.

I thought a moment about making one of my Christmas steaks as I lit incense to set a mood. The kids had gotten them for me from an Omaha Steaks rip-off last December and I had had only one so far. But I’d have to just clean up all over again and decided on a pizza. It could be here in an hour which would leave me plenty of time to eat and have reign over my home until my family returned tonight.

I ordered a medium with beef, onion, and mushroom and ran myself a bubble bath. I had a glass of white wine and fully luxuriated, taking time to read a book and exfoliate the soles of my feet and palms before I washed.

As the water was draining and I was drying off, I got a look at the bottle I’d used for my bubbles. I’d grabbed it from beneath the sink without actually reading it. The label was faded, but when I leaned closer, still couldn’t recognize any of the characters.

I had no idea what language that was and considering a little bit of high school Spanish was the extent of what either I and my wife spoke of a foreign tongue, couldn’t fathom how the thing had gotten in my home.

It took me three times to finally hang up my drying towel. I just kept dropping it like there was something on it and I supposed there may have been soap on me I hadn’t rinsed off. I wiped my hands on the towel and missed the dirty clothes basket with it.

I thought about taking a shower, but then thought better of it. The pizza would be here soon and I didn’t want to waste more time doing something I’d already done. Being a little sticky wasn’t that big of a deal.

I took the container of medicated lotion out of the linen closet. With my eczema, I needed something more hydrating than regular lotion and slathered my whole body. The water finally finished draining from the tub and when I turned to clean it—surprise-surprise—there wasn’t a ring.

I found a pair of boxers and was slipping on a t-shirt as I came downstairs. I checked the clock on the microwave and figured I had a little time before the pizza arrived.

I sat the wine glass on the counter and turned for the fridge to get the bottle and I heard glass break. I looked at the floor by my feet and saw the wine glass, half-shattered. I thought I’d put the glass several inches back on the counter—maybe it had fallen over and rolled onto the floor. Obviously, I hadn’t sat it back far enough.

I retrieved the broom and dustpan in the pantry and swept up all the smaller pieces I couldn’t pick up by hand. I deposited everything in the trash and again, that filmy feel was on my hand and I wiped it on my t-shirt.

I washed my hands and grabbed another glass from the cupboard. I’d left the refrigerator door open and grabbed the Pinot, thumbing the cork until it popped out of the neck of the bottle and pouring a hefty glass.

But the odd thing was when I tried to let go of the glass, I had to peel my hand open. Whatever it was, wasn’t just on the glass—I had stickum between my fingers and the same with my other hand. I looked in the fridge to see if anything had spilled.

A quick rinse of my hands in the sink again and I tried to pat my hands dry on my shirt, almost pulling it off. Whatever that film was was still there and it was getting…stickier.

Seattle is one of the most dynamic and desirable places to call home on the West Coast — but it has unique lifestyle features and real estate nuances that are worth understanding before you make the leap.

Seattle’s combination of stunning natural scenery, booming job market, and vibrant culture makes it stand out yet its cost of living, housing market dynamics, and everyday lifestyle realities can surprise newcomers. Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering living in Seattle.

**Natural Beauty and Outdoor Lifestyle**

One of the first things people notice about **living in Seattle** is how easy it is to enjoy the outdoors.  
Seattle sits between the Puget Sound and the Cascade and Olympic Mountains, offering unrivaled access to water-based activities, hiking, skiing, and more. Locals take full advantage of waterfront parks, trails, lakes, and year-round outdoor recreation, whether it’s paddleboarding on Lake Union, hiking in the Cascades, or skiing nearby in winter.

If you love nature and outdoor adventure, Seattle gives you some of the best options of any major U.S. city.

# Weather: It’s a Different Kind of Rain

Seattle’s weather is famous and it’s not just hype. While temperatures are mild year-round, the city experiences many overcast and rainy days, especially in fall and winter. Seattle skies are often gray, which can take some getting used to and can even affect mood if you’re sensitive to cloudy days.

Summers in Seattle are beautiful, mild, and sunny, but if you’re coming from a consistently bright climate, the fall/winter pattern of light rain and clouds may surprise you. Pack a good raincoat, and embrace the mild climate rather than fight it.

**Cost of Living and Everyday Expenses**

Seattle is not a budget city. Its cost of living including housing, groceries, dining, transportation, and services is significantly higher than the U.S. average. Housing costs are a major factor in this: both renting and buying tend to be pricey compared to many other metro areas.

Residents report that dining out, groceries, and services can also add up quickly compared to other cities, so budgeting wisely is key when planning your move.

Despite the high expenses, many people accept the trade-off for Seattle’s lifestyle, job opportunities, and cultural amenities.

**A Tech-Driven, Job-Rich Economy**

One of Seattle’s strongest draws is its robust job market especially in tech, healthcare, and innovation sectors. It’s home to major employers like Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks, and others. 

This economic strength fuels demand for housing, supports higher salaries, and keeps **Seattle real estate** competitive. If you’re moving here for work, you’re joining a vibrant labor market with opportunities across industries.

**Real Estate Trends: What You Should Know**

# Competitive but Changing Market

Seattle’s housing market has historically been competitive, with tight inventory and strong demand though recent trends show shifts that buyers should understand. Inventory has grown in many parts of the metro area, and sellers have increasingly offered incentives like closing cost assistance to attract buyers.

Unlike a few years ago, buyer leverage has improved in some segments, especially condos and townhomes, making it a more balanced market than before.

Still, low inventory and high demand in desirable neighborhoods mean you’ll want expert help navigating **Seattle real estate** especially if timing and pricing matter for your goals.

**Neighborhood Diversity: City vs Suburbs**

Seattle isn’t a single homogeneous place it’s a collection of neighborhoods, each with its own vibe:

* **Capitol Hill**: Trendy, walkable, and culturally vibrant.
* **Ballard & Fremont**: Popular with young professionals and creatives.
* **Wallingford & University District**: Central, classic Seattle residential choices.

Many newcomers also explore suburbs like Bellevue, Redmond, or Renton for more space and different lifestyle rhythms especially if affordability or schools are priorities. Suburban homes often offer larger lots and quieter neighborhoods outside the urban core.

Understanding how each area aligns with your lifestyle and commute will help you find the right fit.

**Transportation and Daily Life**

Traffic in Seattle can be a real consideration. Congestion during peak hours on major routes is common, and planning your commute is important if you work in or near downtown.

That said, Seattle has a growing public transit network including buses, light rail, and ferries and many residents opt for walkable or transit-oriented neighborhoods to minimize driving.

If you plan to live farther from your workplace or transit lines, a car can become a practical necessity for daily life.

**The Culture and Food Scene**

Seattle’s cultural fabric is rich from world-class seafood and a thriving coffee scene to music, art, festivals, and diverse neighborhoods with local flavor. Many residents value community events, independent businesses, and a relaxed Pacific Northwest vibe.

While some national chain food options are fewer, this creates space for local eateries, cafes, and unique cultural experiences that define Seattle living.

**Tips for New Residents**

If you’re seriously considering living in Seattle:

* **Prepare financially** for a higher cost of living and competitive housing market.
* **Visit neighborhoods** in person to feel the differences in vibe, amenities, and commute.
* **Work with local experts** who know the Seattle market inside out agents who understand pricing trends, negotiation strategies, and desired locations. 

**Final Thoughts**

Living in Seattle offers an enviable combination of natural beauty, economic opportunity, and cultural vibrancy. But its cost of living, weather patterns, and real estate market require thoughtful planning and informed decisions.

Whether you’re buying your first home, relocating for work, or seeking a new lifestyle, understanding these core aspects will help you make the move with confidence.

But for some reason I’m completely blind when it comes to someone I like. I *can* read this person, but I don’t understand hints or their feelings toward me. I don’t understand how important I am to them or what level of priority I even have. I don’t catch hints and I spiral in my head until someone says things directly. And it’s killing me

A little about me: I’m not a native English speaker, I’m 25, and I’m a single mom to a 6 yo daughter. I teach a foreign language and run my own startup. I have a very bad relationship with my father, which resulted in “daddy issues” that I’m actively working on with a therapist

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling more and more emptiness inside. After my career as a professional athlete ended due to an injury I feel like I lost myself. I feel like a robot, I don’t really feel anything anymore. I’m not depressed, I just feel… empty

I understand that 25 is still considered young, but I really want a family. I want to be a wife and bring coffee to my husband while he’s working, as silly as that may sound

Dear INTJs, do you have the same problem with the opposite sex? Or maybe I’m just meeting the wrong men? I always rush things and plan ten years ahead, playing out every possible scenario with this person in my head, while he’s still at the stage of “I’m interested in you, let’s just stay in the moment”

I don’t know how to live in the moment and all of this just drags me down even more  
It feels like I’m trying to fill this emptiness with relationships, but in the end I only suffer more because of it

So today I was literally threatened by a potato, and I’m still trying to figure out how I became the problem.
I was in the kitchen making coffee for myself and for an older family member. She asks me where the nail brush is. I don’t even use a nail brush, so I calmly say, “I don’t know, you should ask the person who uses it (21M).”
Then a younger family member (15F) goes to ask him, and he says she should ask me instead.
A bit later, the same older family member asks where the yellow scrubbing brush is. Again, I say I don’t know and suggest asking the person who actually uses it (21M). No attitude, no tone.
Suddenly she asks me if I woke up in a mood.
I’m confused, so I lift my arms slightly and ask what’s wrong, genuinely confused.
Next thing I know, she’s right in my face, holding a knife and a potato, screaming that she’ll hit me with it because my face is “hanging” and I’m being “FUCKING DISRESPECTFUL.”
All of this is because I looked like I was in a mood.
She then tells me I must never talk to her again.
So now I’m sitting here wondering:
Am I wrong for not knowing where items are that I don’t use?
Or is it normal to assume disrespect, instantly escalate, and threaten someone over their facial expression?
This isn’t the first time I’ve been treated like I’m automatically wrong. If I speak, I’m rude. If I don’t, I’m disrespectful. Somehow everything always comes back to being my fault.

1pzidwn,https://i.redd.it/cnh2v86jhcag1.jpeg,Holiday sketch,"Dear Dreamers, and the last sketch of this December from our Oksana. ❤

A cozy Manhattan coffee shop smelled of cinnamon, and a soft Christmas tune played. A tall man with ash-blond hair sat at a table by the window overlooking Central Park. Warming his hands on a cup of hot coffee, he gazed enchanted at his companion, who sat across from him.

For Blair, the last few days had seemed like a fairy tale. She couldn't have imagined that on Christmas Eve she would receive an invitation to visit New York and spend the entire winter holidays in the city of dreams.

And now, sitting in the coffee shop, Blair, unable to hide her childish joy, gazed around in delight.

“Winter New York is even better than I imagined. Just like in those movies they show at Christmas!“ the girl smiled, taking a sip of coffee. “You haven’t seen the Union Square Christmas Market yet,” Hunter remarked. “For me, that’s where the Christmas spirit really lives.”

“Then I want to visit.”

“No problem. We’ll go there tomorrow.”

Blair took a couple more sips and, a little embarrassed, spoke up.

“Hunter, I’m so glad you invited me here, organized everything, and now spend all your free time with me… but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m distracting you from your work. You know, before Christmas, you usually want to visit friends, buy presents, decorate the house, finish up old chores…” 

“Probably most New Yorkers follow that same plan,” Hunter shrugged. “But this year, that’s not my story. I want to finally spend these holidays in a special way and…” Hunter paused for a long moment, gathering his thoughts. And finally added:

“…with someone special. With you, Blair.” At that moment, Hunter's warm hands touched hers, embracing them and pressing them even more tightly to the cup. His gaze—tremulous and tender—suggested hope for his own miracle. And, looking into his eyes, her heart began to beat faster. The girl smiled softly, barely maintaining her composure and resisting the urge to jump up and down, wrapping Hunter in her arms and hanging on his shoulders.

Christmas is a time for miracles. And now Blair had no doubt about it. ""If this is my dream, then I don't want to wake up,"" she thought. ""And if all this is really happening, then all my New Year's wishes have finally come true...""",7,1767102010.0,leagueofdreamers,1,1.0,False

After they had left, my day began with a cup of coffee. I added in a little vodka—gross, but not the point. Just because I wasn’t going outside didn’t mean I was stuck. Today was going to be Me Day.

I did pour out the coffee, though, and before I got too into enjoying my day, I took an hour to clean up the house. Three kids had a way of making a mess of everything no matter how much I spot-checked and I couldn’t enjoy myself until it had been taken care of.

The bathrooms were first, then the toilets and mirrors. I swept all the hardwood and tiled floors before vacuuming and finished in the kitchen.

I thought a moment about making one of my Christmas steaks as I lit incense to set a mood. The kids had gotten them for me from an Omaha Steaks rip-off last December and I had had only one so far. But I’d have to just clean up all over again and decided on a pizza. It could be here in an hour which would leave me plenty of time to eat and have reign over my home until my family returned tonight.

I ordered a medium with beef, onion, and mushroom and ran myself a bubble bath. I had a glass of white wine and fully luxuriated, taking time to read a book and exfoliate the soles of my feet and palms before I washed.

As the water was draining and I was drying off, I got a look at the bottle I’d used for my bubbles. I’d grabbed it from beneath the sink without actually reading it. The label was faded, but when I leaned closer, still couldn’t recognize any of the characters.

I had no idea what language that was and considering a little bit of high school Spanish was the extent of what either I and my wife spoke of a foreign tongue, couldn’t fathom how the thing had gotten in my home.

It took me three times to finally hang up my drying towel. I just kept dropping it like there was something on it and I supposed there may have been soap on me I hadn’t rinsed off. I wiped my hands on the towel and missed the dirty clothes basket with it.

I thought about taking a shower, but then thought better of it. The pizza would be here soon and I didn’t want to waste more time doing something I’d already done. Being a little sticky wasn’t that big of a deal.

I took the container of medicated lotion out of the linen closet. With my eczema, I needed something more hydrating than regular lotion and slathered my whole body. The water finally finished draining from the tub and when I turned to clean it—surprise-surprise—there wasn’t a ring.

I found a pair of boxers and was slipping on a t-shirt as I came downstairs. I checked the clock on the microwave and figured I had a little time before the pizza arrived.

I sat the wine glass on the counter and turned for the fridge to get the bottle and I heard glass break. I looked at the floor by my feet and saw the wine glass, half-shattered. I thought I’d put the glass several inches back on the counter—maybe it had fallen over and rolled onto the floor. Obviously, I hadn’t sat it back far enough.

I retrieved the broom and dustpan in the pantry and swept up all the smaller pieces I couldn’t pick up by hand. I deposited everything in the trash and again, that filmy feel was on my hand and I wiped it on my t-shirt.

I washed my hands and grabbed another glass from the cupboard. I’d left the refrigerator door open and grabbed the Pinot, thumbing the cork until it popped out of the neck of the bottle and pouring a hefty glass.

But the odd thing was when I tried to let go of the glass, I had to peel my hand open. Whatever it was, wasn’t just on the glass—I had stickum between my fingers and the same with my other hand. I looked in the fridge to see if anything had spilled.

A quick rinse of my hands in the sink again and I tried to pat my hands dry on my shirt, almost pulling it off. Whatever that film was was still there and it was getting…stickier.

I took a step toward the refrigerator and the sole of one foot hurt so bad I thought I’d left a layer of skin on the floor. I hit the door with the point of my elbow, knocking it shut.

Foreword: Why Your Knee Deserves Better Than a Blind Poke

For decades, we’ve treated the human knee like a piñata at a birthday party. We palpate a few landmarks, close our eyes, take a wild swing with a needle, and hope we hit the prize. The literature tells us this ""blind poke"" method is accurate a whopping 79% of the time, which means more than one in five times, you're injecting expensive medicine into a useless fat pad. It's the clinical equivalent of a guided guess. Ultrasound, my friends, is the guided missile. It transforms you from a hopeful guesser into a surgical sniper, allowing you to see exactly where your needle is going in real-time. Forget the dry, soul-crushing textbooks that make anatomy feel like a punishment. This guide is your cheat sheet.

Our mission is to break down the most common ultrasound-guided knee procedures into ridiculously simple, memorable steps. We'll use stories, absurd analogies, and the kind of clinical pearls that actually stick in your brain at 3 AM. We’re going to make you an ultrasound pro, and you might even have a little fun doing it.

So, let's get started with the main event: getting inside the knee's engine room.

This is your bread and butter, the go-to move for global knee problems like osteoarthritis. Mastering this injection is the foundation for everything else. It’s about delivering relief directly to the heart of the problem, and with ultrasound, you're going to get it right every single time.

The Big Picture

Think of an osteoarthritic knee as a rusty, squeaky door hinge. An intra-articular injection is like spraying WD-40 right into that hinge mechanism to quiet it down. The old, blind way of doing this is like standing back and spraying the entire door, hoping some of the lubricant seeps into the right spot. It’s messy and inefficient. Ultrasound, however, lets you take that little red straw on the WD-40 can, place it precisely into the joint's ""secret mail slot""—the suprapatellar recess—and deliver the goods with pinpoint accuracy.

The Cast of Characters

To get into the joint, you need to know the players involved in the superolateral approach:

* The Quadriceps Tendon: This is the big, tough Bouncer at the front of the club. It's a thick, trilaminar structure that you don't want to poke with a sharp object. Our clever trick is to rotate the probe 45 degrees, which allows our needle to sneak in from the side, completely avoiding any arguments with this tough guy.
* The Suprapatellar & Prefemoral Fat Pads (SPFP & PFFP): Meet the two squishy, lazy Pillows that love to get in the way. These are the culprits behind the 21% failure rate of blind injections. Your needle gets buried uselessly in one of these pillows, and your patient gets zero relief. Ultrasound lets you see them and slide right past.
* The Suprapatellar Recess (SPR): This is our target, the Secret Mail Slot that provides direct access to the entire knee joint. Our entire mission is to slip our needle and medicine through this slot. Sometimes, if there isn't a lot of fluid, the slot can be hard to see. The trick is to gently squeeze the sides of the knee, which pushes synovial fluid up into the recess, making it visible—like fluffing up a letter so it’s easier to grab through the mail slot.

The 3 AM Clinical Pearl

It's late, you have a patient with a massively swollen, hot, painful knee from an arthritic flare-up. Why does this technique matter right now? Because you're not just injecting; you're aspirating first. Trying to inject medicine into a knee already full of inflammatory fluid is like trying to patch a flooded boat without bailing it out first. Ultrasound confirms your needle is in the perfect spot to drain that effusion effectively, giving the patient immediate relief from the pressure and ensuring your anti-inflammatory injection isn't diluted into uselessness.

The Unforgettable Brain-Hack

* Mnemonic: For the key steps of the superolateral approach, remember L.A.R.P.
  * Laterally Aim Rotated Probe
  * You're not just injecting; you're doing Live Action Role Play to get past the Quadriceps Bouncer.
* Mental Cartoon: Imagine a tiny secret agent (your needle) trying to deliver a package (the medicine). The agent approaches from the side of a huge building (the patella), expertly avoids the big Bouncer patrolling the roof (Quadriceps Tendon), and slips the package into a high-up mail slot (the SPR) that's perfectly hidden between two fluffy bushes (the fat pads).

Now that you've mastered flooding the main joint, let's tackle the knee's annoying back-end plumbing problem: the Baker's Cyst.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Taming the Baker's Cyst: The Knee's Annoying Back Pouch

First thing's first: a Baker's Cyst isn't a disease. It's a symptom. It’s the warning light on your car's dashboard telling you that something is wrong inside the main engine compartment (the knee joint). Simply draining it without addressing the underlying issue is like putting black tape over the warning light and hoping the problem goes away. It isn't just a temporary fix; it's a fundamental clinical error.

The Big Picture

Imagine your knee joint is a high-pressure kitchen sink. When you have arthritis or a meniscus tear, the faucet is running constantly, and the pressure inside the sink (joint effusion) builds up. There's a known weak spot in the plumbing under the sink, right between two pipes called the semimembranosus and gastrocnemius. When the pressure gets high enough, a one-way valve pops open and squirts fluid into a balloon (the Baker's Cyst). The valve then closes, trapping the fluid in the balloon. This is why just draining the balloon is a temporary fix; you have to turn down the pressure in the sink itself, which is why our final step is often an anti-inflammatory injection right back in the main joint.

The Cast of Characters

Welcome to the back of the knee. Let's meet the neighbors:

* The Semimembranosus (SM) & Medial Head of Gastrocnemius (GH): These are two grumpy neighbors who share a weak fence between their properties. When pressure builds up in the main neighborhood (the knee joint), fluid leaks right through this flimsy fence and collects in a pouch.
* The Semitendinosus (ST): This tendon is your absolute best friend and landmark. On ultrasound, it sits right on top of the Semimembranosus like a ""Cherry on the Cake."" When you see this perfect little signpost, you know you're in exactly the right neighborhood.
* The Pedicle: This is the Annoying Leaky Faucet Stem that connects the balloon (the cyst) to the main plumbing (the joint). You must identify and mark this little channel first. If you drain the balloon before you mark the stem, the whole thing will collapse and you'll never find it. The strategy is to use two needles: first, you slide a 16G needle in to just mark the location of the pedicle without popping the cyst. Then, you use a second, separate needle to do the actual aspiration and fenestration.

The 3 AM Clinical Pearl

A patient comes to the ER terrified they have a DVT. Their calf is swollen, tense, and painful. It's a ruptured Baker's Cyst. How does your ultrasound skill save the day (and prevent a massive, unnecessary workup)? Ultrasound is 100% sensitive, specific, and accurate here. You can immediately differentiate the murky, particulate-filled fluid of a cyst from a vascular thrombus. While you're at it, check the nature of the fluid. If it's thick and full of debris, you'll need an 18-gauge needle or larger to aspirate it. Trying to suck a thick milkshake through a coffee stirrer is a recipe for failure and frustration. And don't forget the final step: after the procedure, the patient must wear a moderate or strong compression elastic knee brace for four weeks to keep the cyst and pedicle walls pressed together and prevent a refill.

The Unforgettable Brain-Hack

* Mnemonic: The steps for getting rid of this thing for good are MPAC-FW.
  * Mark the Pedicle, Aspirate the Cyst, Fenestrate the Walls
  * You're on a Mission to PACk up this cyst for good and hit it with a Final Whack.
* Mental Cartoon: Picture a water balloon (the cyst) tied to a faucet (the pedicle). First, with one hand, you put a bright red 'X' sticker on the faucet itself (the marking needle). Then, with your other hand, you poke a big hole in the balloon and drain it (the aspiration needle). Finally, you take that second needle and go to town, repeatedly poking the now-empty balloon and the faucet stem to shred them (fenestration), ensuring they can't fill up again.

After fixing the plumbing out back, let's move to the inner side of the knee where a trio of tendons can cause a ruckus.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Silencing the Pes Anserinus: The Goose That Honks with Pain

This is a classic clinical curveball. Pes Anserinus bursitis is a great mimicker of medial compartment osteoarthritis pain. Correctly identifying this as an extra-articular pain generator can save a patient from an unnecessary intra-articular injection that would have completely missed the target.

The Big Picture

The Pes Anserinus tendons are like three strong ropes—the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus—that all pull on the inner side of the tibia. To keep these ropes from rubbing directly on the bone, the body places a small, oil-filled mat between them called the anserine bursa. In patients with conditions like valgus deformity (""knock-knees"") or osteoarthritis, these ropes start rubbing way too hard. The oil mat gets inflamed, swollen, and angry. Every time the knee moves, the bursa ""honks"" with pain.

The Cast of Characters

Let's meet the group responsible for the noise:

* Sartorius, Gracilis, & Semitendinosus: This conjoined group of tendons is best thought of as ""A Gaggle of Geese"" (playing on the Latin name pes anserinus, or ""goose's foot""). They all try to land on the exact same spot on the tibia, creating a crowded, webbed insertion point.
* The Anserine Bursa: This is the overworked, underappreciated ""Floor Mat"" that gets trampled into a painful pulp by the landing geese. Our only job is to inject some soothing medicine onto this irritated mat.
* The Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL): This is the sturdy ""Wall"" that the floor mat is pressed up against. Our target for the injection is the paper-thin space between this Wall and the feet of the geese.

The 3 AM Clinical Pearl

A patient with known medial knee OA comes in complaining of a sharp, localized increase in pain over their anteromedial tibia. It's not responding to their usual arthritis treatments. What's the trap? The trap is assuming all medial knee pain in an OA patient is coming from the joint. This is classic pes anserinus bursitis. It happens because the underlying OA or a valgus deformity increases mechanical stress on the medial side of the knee, which directly irritates the bursa. Your ultrasound skills are critical here. You can see the bursa—normally a thin, hypoechoic line—blown up into a painful fluid collection. Putting the patient in the ""Figure of 4"" position (flexed knee, externally rotated hip) stretches the tendons and unmasks the culprits perfectly, allowing you to target them for a direct hit.

The Unforgettable Brain-Hack

* Mnemonic: To remember the three tendons in order from superficial to deep, just remember your manners:
  * ""Say Grace before Tea"" (Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendinosus).
* Mental Cartoon: Imagine a goose with three legs (the tendons) wearing a single, oversized webbed boot. The goose is standing on a small welcome mat (the bursa) that's placed right next to a brick wall (the tibia/MCL). Your needle is a tiny hose, carefully sliding under the goose's webbed foot to soak the welcome mat with medicine, without ever touching the goose or the wall.

Now that we've quieted the goose on the inside, let's deal with the overachieving athlete on the outside: the Iliotibial Band.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Calming the Iliotibial Band: The Overly Enthusiastic Runner

ITB syndrome is the quintessential overuse injury, plaguing runners, cyclists, and other active folks. The pain here is caused by pure mechanical friction, not necessarily a problem inside the joint. A single, precise injection can be a complete game-changer for these patients, getting them back to their sport without months of frustration.

The Big Picture

The Iliotibial Band (ITB) is like a thick, brutally non-elastic rope running along the outside of the thigh. The lateral femoral epicondyle is a prominent bony bump it's forced to slide over thousands of times with every single step or pedal stroke. Eventually, the rope starts to chafe against the bump. This constant friction irritates the sensitive, fatty, connective tissue and bursa underneath, sparking a fire of inflammation and pain. Our injection is simply a dose of high-powered lubricant and fire extinguisher applied directly to that friction point.

The Cast of Characters

* The Iliotibial Band (ITB): This is a Type-A, over-achieving ""Marathon Runner"" who is simply too tense and rigid for their own good. It refuses to stretch, and instead just grinds away relentlessly at anything in its path.
* The Lateral Femoral Epicondyle: This is the ""Sharp Corner on the Wall"" that the Marathon Runner scrapes their shoulder against on every single lap around the track.
* The ITB Bursa: This is the tiny ""Grease Packet"" that's supposed to protect the wall from the runner. After thousands of laps, it gets compressed, inflamed, and completely overwhelmed by the constant friction. On ultrasound, this normally invisible structure will swell up with fluid.
* Gerdy's Tubercle: This is the ""Finish Line,"" the bony prominence on the tibia where the exhausted and angry Marathon Runner finally attaches.

The 3 AM Clinical Pearl

An athlete presents with sharp lateral knee pain. How do you use ultrasound to not only confirm ITB syndrome but also ensure your injection is both effective and safe? The key is surgical precision. You must inject into the bursal space deep to the ITB. Injecting into the thick, dense ITB itself is like injecting concrete into a rope—it does nothing for the friction and can cause iatrogenic damage to the tendon. The source text shows two ways in: a top-down approach that pierces the ITB, and a much smarter posterior approach that slides the needle in from behind. This posterior approach, performed with the probe in a short axis orientation, avoids stabbing the ""Marathon Runner"" altogether, making it safer, less painful, and more elegant.

The Unforgettable Brain-Hack

* Mnemonic: For the simple cause of the pain:
  * ""Idiotic Tense Band Rubs Bone""
* Mental Cartoon: Picture a thick guitar string (the ITB) stretched taut over a bony bump on the side of the guitar (the epicondyle). Every time the knee bends, the string scrapes on the bump, making an angry ""ZING!"" noise of pain. Your needle is a tiny oil can with a long, flexible spout, sneaking in from behind the string to squirt oil right on the friction point, instantly silencing the noise.

Having managed the friction on the side, let's address the explosive power center at the front: the Patellar Tendon.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Soothing Jumper's Knee: The Angry Patellar Tendon

Patellar tendinopathy, or ""Jumper's Knee,"" is the classic injury of athletes in explosive power sports like basketball and volleyball. They put immense, repetitive stress on their knee extensors, and the patellar tendon pays the price. Ultrasound isn't just crucial for seeing the damage; it’s essential for guiding different, highly specific interventions to fix it.

The Big Picture

The Patellar Tendon is the massive tow cable connecting the kneecap (patella) to the shin bone (tibia). In athletes, this cable is subjected to enormous, repetitive yanking forces, like trying to pull a semi-truck out of deep mud over and over and over again. This abuse causes micro-tears and degeneration within the cable itself, especially where it attaches to the bottom of the kneecap. The body tries to heal this damage, but its response is disorganized, dysfunctional, and painful.

The Cast of Characters

* The Patellar Tendon (PT): Personify it as an overworked, chronically angry ""Tow Truck Cable"" that is starting to fray, unravel, and weaken from stress. On ultrasound, this anger shows up as it becoming darker (decreased echogenicity), thicker, and even developing holes (sonolucent regions or cysts).
* Hoffa's Fat Pad: This is the ""Big Fluffy Cushion"" that sits right behind the Tow Truck Cable. It's an innocent bystander that often gets irritated and inflamed by the chaos happening in front of it.
* Crura Fascia: This is the thin ""Saran Wrap"" layer that lies just on top of the tendon, separating it from the subcutaneous tissue.
* Neovascularization: When you turn on the Doppler, you might see this. These are ""Angry Little Blood Vessels."" It's a hallmark of a dysfunctional healing response. The body sends in a chaotic mess of new blood vessels that bring pain-sensing nerves along for the ride, making the problem worse.

The 3 AM Clinical Pearl

You're treating an athlete with chronic jumper's knee. The literature mentions several different procedures: peritendon injections, high-volume injections, and needle fenestration. How does ultrasound tell you which to use? This is where ultrasound truly shines. It’s not just for putting a needle somewhere; it’s for putting it in a specific tissue plane for a specific purpose.

* Peritendon Injection: You're gently sliding the needle between the angry cable (PT) and its Saran Wrap covering (crura fascia) to deliver anti-inflammatory medicine to the surface.
* High-Volume Injection: You're aiming for the plane deep to the tendon, using a large volume of fluid to physically dissect and separate the angry cable from the innocent bystander cushion (Hoffa's fat pad) behind it.
* Fenestration or PRP: You're going right into the belly of the beast. You use the ultrasound to identify the most damaged, frayed part of the cable (the intratendinous tear) and repeatedly poke it with a needle to break up scar tissue and stimulate a new, more organized healing response.

The Unforgettable Brain-Hack

* Mnemonic: For the ultrasound findings of an unhappy tendon, just remember it looks...
  * ""Thick, Dark, and full of Holes"" (Thickened, Hypoechoic, Sonolucent regions/cysts).
* Mental Cartoon: Imagine that thick, frayed rope (the PT). For a peritendon injection, a tiny needle gently separates the rope from its clear plastic wrapper. For a high-volume injection, a big fire hose blasts water behind the rope, pushing it away from a big yellow sponge (Hoffa's pad). For fenestration, the needle acts like a sewing needle, repeatedly poking right into the most frayed part of the rope to encourage all the loose fibers to finally heal back together properly.

Maya

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

“Hi,” I said, because my mouth was a traitor. “Creative housing?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

1pzi7a0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzi7a0,"Layered ""Hot Drink"" Cake - 259 kcal total!","Hey!





I've been working on this rather complex project for a while, and today I think it is ready to be shared!



It is a 15 cm personal cake that consists of four parts: crispy crust, tea jelly, chocolate marshmallow and coffee foam.

It is only 259 kcal for entire thing, this is achieved mainly thanks to some of the most volume friendly ingredients - water and air. Crust itself is 185 kcal. Don't get fooled by 15 cm radius, it well makes up for it with thickness and is very voluminous.

As you might imagine from listed components, it tastes bittersweet - and that is what I wanted it to be.

I tried snapping as many pics of process as I could, hope those will make things clearer! Each individual part is easy on it's own. Oh, and for simpler version you can do just do crust + 2x amount of any single filler of choice.







Recipe for 15cm round mold:







**A. Tea Jelly**



I prep this in advance together with second part (marshmallow) in the evening and let it set overnight.



*Ingredients:*

1. 150g Hot tea to taste, better if stronger and sweeter than you would normally drink (I used 1 teabag and 4 sweetener tablets for 150g water)

2. 50g Cold water

3. 8g Gelatin (this is more than for regular jelly, it is a load bearing jelly and we need it to be stiffer)



Bloom gelatin in cold water for around 10 minutes, pour hot tea over it and mix until gelatin dissolves. Transfer to mold and set aside (I use silicone mold, as I don't have small enough other type of mold).







**B. Hot Chocolate Marshmallow**



*Ingredients:*

1. 33g Cold Water

2. 9g Gelatin

3. Pinch of Cream of Tartar (optional)

4. Pinch of Xanthan Gum (optional)

5. Splash of vanilla extract (kinda optional)



6. 40g Boiling water

7. 18g Granulated sweetener (I use erythritol; more is better, I tried keeping it to bare minimum since this recipe overall uses a lot of sugar alcohol)

8. 1g Cocoa powder (be careful with this, as cocoa actively prevents marshmallow from whipping, you can use more if you want, but you will get something like dense darker chocolate foam/mousse instead of marshmallow, which isn't a bad thing either, I tried. 1g is very mild chocolate taste and color)



Bloom gelatin in cold water for around 10 minutes and in the mean time bring rest of the water to boil and fully dissolve sweetener and cocoa in it, then let it cool for a bit. Add cream of tartar, xanthan gum and vanilla extract to gelatin, pour chocolate syrup over it and whip until you get stiff peaks, do not settle on soft peaks! It generally takes a lot of time to get there (10+ minutes for normal sized batches), and cocoa only makes it harder, but for portion this small it only took me 4 minutes.

Add marshmallow mixture to the mold, over tea jelly (it will float, don't worry). Try spreading it so it covers entire area, it won't be easy as it is atop of still liquid tea (I never wait for it to set first, bet it would make things much easier), but no need to try too hard either, as it will be covered with coffee layer anyway.

Let this cool to room temperature (if not already), then put into fridge and cover with something. I leave it overnight to set.

Once set, carefully take this thing out of the mold and put it back in the fridge, as we gonna need this same mold (or identical one) to bake our crust.





**C. Crust**



*Ingredients:*

1. 20g Cold water

2. 5g Granulated sweetener (I use erythritol, again, can use more if desired, but carob brings enough sweetness for me)

3. 3g Instant coffee (can be decaf, can skip entirely tbh)



4. 20g Greek yogurt (mine is 2.5% fat)

5. Splash of vanilla extract



6. 20g AP flour

7. 20g Cornstarch

8. 12g Carob powder

9. Pinch of salt

10. Pinch of cinnamon (optional, I just had it nearby, ready for decorations)





Mix dry ingredients (6-10). Dissolve coffee and sweetener in cold water, mix with greek yogurt and vanilla extract. Sift in dry ingredients (you really want to sift in, as carob powder tends to clump up quite a bit), mix until you get something that looks and feels like ball of clay. Press it into mold (don't roll). Try spreading it evenly to best of your ability, as we want it to be crispy and brittle to mimic shortcrust without any fat (this dough has 1g fat total), thick patches will feel very bread-like. Once done, poke a bunch of holes in the bottom and put it into pre-heated air frier for 17 minutes at 160C (I never tried this in normal oven, but feel free to try). Once done, take it out of the mold and put on wire rack or upside down (or both) to cool to room temperature, then put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.



Once it is cold, take your jelly-marshmallow filling and just... carefully put it in. It will naturally be a bit bigger, but flexible, so will fit and sit tightly. At this point cake is basically ready, some might want to skip last part, as that coffee topping might be not to everyone's liking! If not skipping, then put cake back into fridge for now.







**D. Dalgona coffee**



This is something I myself only learned very very recently, I was surprised that this even works! However, this foam does not last long, so must be prepared and applied right before consumption, and then consumed ASAP. Even with xanthan gum added for stability, after 10 minutes it already is noticeably weaker density than first minute. Also, both coffee and sweetener contribute to structure, so if you find it too bitter or too sweet, oh well, reducing either will affect quality, not just taste.

I myself really like it, but again, I can see some might want to skip this step entirely due to either taste or high sugar alcohol/caffeine content.



*Ingredients:*

1. 30g Cold water

2. 5g Instant coffee (can be decaf)

3. 15g Granulated sweetener (I use erythritol)

4. Pinch of Xanthan Gum (optional)



Mix all ingredients and whip at max speed for couple of minutes until stiff peaks and it is pale. Take your cake out of the fridge, apply coffee foam, sprinkle some negligible amount of whatever for extra decor (I still counted that cinnamon and coconut flakes as 10 kcal, but there sure wasn't that much of them). Perhaps would have been a good idea to pipe this foam for better presentation, but it is what it is!





Note that this cake is not very sliceable, crust is very brittle. I did small slice just for this post, but normally I just... bite.

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I refuse to board them, but I don't want to take advantage of my parents more than twice a year for pet sitting, and I don't have any other friends or family who could help out. 

So I'd like to test them out on some weekend trips within a few hours' drive (I live in Knoxville, TN), and I want to plan a few activities they might enjoy to offset all the boring time on the road. I've also thought about staying in Airbnbs so I can leave them behind to decompress and sleep while I go out to dinner or a show. They're very good about staying home alone while I'm at work.

Can anyone suggest some activities I can do with them to make the trip worthwhile? And maybe some precautions I should take? We don't normally go anywhere except various parks, short hiking trails, and the coffee shop drive through for pup cups. Both of my dogs are rescue seniors and have trouble staying calm around strange dogs and people.

Picked up some cheap,  real and extremely heavy terrazzo tiles (600x600x20ml). And decided to use two as a table top 

They look amazing, however I am wondering about the way in which I’ve gone about laying them on the base. Looking for any advice. 

I picked up a furniture grade piece of 18ml European poplar ply 600x1200, to use as a substrate to glue to. I wasn’t aware you could tile to ply and didn’t think it would adhere but boss seemed to think it’d be fine. 

I back buttered the tiles, primed and troweled the base before applying the tiles hard up to each other on top of the ply. 

1. Given there are two heavy separate tiles 20ml thick adhered to a piece of ply that is 18ml thick, what are some suggestions to apply to the underside of the table top to stiffen it up a bit?

3. If so any suggestions on legs? Going for mid century modern, an alternative to hairpins which seem to be suggested everywhere.

The borderland of wake and dream.
A city wakes in gray and blue,
To start the clock and push on through.

The iron rails begin to hum,
The rhythmic beat of morning’s drum.
Across the glass, the raindrops race,
Each finding its own fleeting place.

We move in patterns, carved and deep,
With promises we mean to keep,
Until the light begins to bend,
And brings the quiet at the end.

I know I need to remove sources of that type of mold and also detox it. It looks like most binders have an affinity for OTA however, I have no idea which is the best for OTA. I see a lot people talking about using Activated Charcoal but I am unsure if that is because people are just drawn to AC or if it is because it is clinically better.

With removal of things: 

Coffee. It is moldy and OTA is the type of mold in coffee. 

Cereal and grains can kick rocks but that means potatoes for starch? Where do we get healthy carbs from?

I can't get rid of meats but I am seeing that chicken is better than pork. I have to eat eggs daily for the choline etc. 

Of course I need to find better housing at the moment but I only have two months left on this lease - no need to hertsmi/ermi.

I didn’t realize I was burning holes into the side of his head until he looked up. 

Our eyes met. 

His lips twitched. 

A smile. 

A small, smug, soul-crushing smile. 

And then he turned to his friend and said something that made im laugh. 

Like I was invisible. Like he hadn’t just one-upped me for the eighth time this semester.

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday. 

\*\*\* 

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport. I’m the “teacher’s favorite,” the “golden girl,” the one with the heart of gold, as Mrs. Benson once said while dabbing tears from her eyes at the spring award ceremony.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away. 

My smile faltered. My stomach twisted.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

But I want to share as much about myself as I can, in hope of finding someone who I can resonate with

Short description: perpetually lonely, live inside my head - almost always watching myself (like i'm constantly aware of what i'm feeling/thinking) as there're no other conventional sources of noise to distract myself, observe think a lot about my own emotional responses to specific situations and exploring possible reasons, think about human behavior a bit, but of philosophy of knowing, among others. I want to feel *connected* to someone you know - I have a lot to say (hundreds and hundreds of entries I would like to share with someone), but I haven't really come across someone who I *want* to share things with. *Want* to be with. *Feel* happy and content around. And I think that probably comes from not having relatable thought and experiences with anyone. In my entire life, I've only had (thankfully, still do) a single real friend, but I still don't feel *connected* like I mentioned above.

I'm going to paste some entries from a journal I maintain (the only place where I am myself, and express whatever I think and feel). You can take a look at my other posts, for starters. I've shared quite a lot in them.

1. i've always wanted that ONE connection who can appreciate my thought processes - say to me that they've thought of similar things too, and share them - i'd be VERY happy to see someone with similar thought processes share their thoughts with me, and it would make me WANT to talk to them enthusiastically. i have one friend, but even they don't have nearly the same thought processes as i do, and it's kind of resulting in me losing enthusiasm while talking with them even though they're a wonderful friend. it's like, you see them recounting their experiences, and you light up, saying ""HEY I can relate to THAT!!"" and that instantly would form a bond (not in the light sense, but a bond in an almost literal sense, tying you together tightly, making you WANT {i'm writing WANT in uppercase to emphasize it... like i've never truly WANTED to be with someone, WANTED to talk to them enthusiastically, MISSED them, things like that})...
2. i want to share every single thing, the good and the ugly with them. and it's not just a matter of them not saying it to others (trust), but also a matter of me WANTING to share everything with them and i think that WANT won't arise until i FEEL the WANT, until I can FEEL that they'd appreciate it you know, like... just relatable/resonating experiences and thought processes...
3. i was handling the hot water for making coffee. the coffee powder got over so i thought i could pour water in it (like i'd seen in a reel where the guy had poured water into the glass bottle full of powder, saying it was for exam prep), so that i could use the remaining bit of coffee stuck to the edges, but in an instant, i stopped, asking if the glass could withstand the hot water. now, how exactly was i able to, in that one second, connect the 2 pieces of information - water is hot, and the bottle is made of glass, to produce the new piece of information (question) whether it was safe? i mean in that one second to have thought of it (or rather, to be provided that connection - framing it differently to take away the agency from me) idk... could have very well proceeded with pouring the water. wonder how the brain works, and moreover, \*i\* wasn't in much control of making that connection... we can be more lenient with people, i mean, i wouldn't blame one for not making that connection in an instant...

in the same light, was wondering about secret spilling... i mean, it just takes a moment to blurt out something you ought not to have. now, i somehow seem to possess the ability to remember that i shouldn't say out something aloud, when the conversation skirts around the secret... the thought to say it aloud does form, but so does the counteracting one...

looks like i can cut everyone who spills secrets some slack (unless if they did it deliberately)... i mean can i take much credit, just like the previous case, if the thought just strikes me (and can i blame if the thought doesnt strike them... it takes just a moment i mean)

4. am i saying that *I* dress up not entirely for myself as an objective representation of how i feel, or is it something else, mean, how the hell is one supposed to run an internal diagnostics to figure this out? and forget that, how am i supposed to stop and wonder what spirit i make arguments in? i mean, i think occam's razor fails spectacularly... the easiest explanation for ""i dress up not completely for myself"" is that i actually feel that way (i'm not even talking from a 2nd person's perspective, observing me making this statement, i'm talking about my *own* persp, if i feel this way... the explanation i'm going to be giving myself, implicitly so, is this only), can we ever know anything.  
No proof of whether you're feeling it actually or giving a feeling words from a few data points (see couple -> general feeling of bad {without nuance, just feeling ""low"" when it could be ""jealous"" or anything like that, and that level of nuance could call for a more nuanced explanation than the have/not have narrative that one could use because they have access to only a very generic set of data points and since others say the same, they assign these words. It's like evaluating a model on its output, which is unreliable, without access to internals...

5. random, naive thought... but by molding the brain into frameworks we know and understand (computational model) for our ease of understanding instead of viewing it objectively for what it is, don't we risk reduction?what are models in the first place? trying to represent stuff we see around in the language we understand. for eg., modelling social interactions as graphs (esp Social media followers). now whether a mathematical set of symbols, lines, and numbers can represent the complex realities of connections is a question. but this is what modelling is, i think. \*might\* be reductionist, but that's not my judgement to make. is reality a video, or can be *treated*/*modeled* as a video? is language a *representation* of thought, or thought itself? if these are just representations/models, what *is* the thing itself?

6. for eg., i told the guy i wanted to go to the other room instead of sitting in this area (and asked him if he wanted to come there too), because the tables there were bigger and more comfortable... now that's not the reason for me wanting to switch, the major reason is that i get to be alone, use discord freely and type out my thoughts, talk to gpt... privacy in one word... being free to feel what i feel... but it *does* sound like a valid enough reason, the table thingie... hmm. i think we can further categorize this into conscious and subconscious excuse-reasoning... i consciously knew the actual reason. the other is a subconscious excuse-reasoning in which we want something but we might not know the exact reason and instead, *genuinely* think that another reason is the reason for it... not limited to just achieving something,

7. so i was listening to songs, but found most of the ones in this playlist uninteresting, when i thought that perhaps the probability of me liking a song depends on whether i've listened to it already in childhood or something. now, this wasn't the first time i'd had this thought, but other times, i'd kind of... let the thought pass? like, think of thoughts that keep flowing in a river, and you see them passing by and they drift away. sometimes they come back. today, i ""caught"" the thought, kind of became more... conscious of it? i wouldn't say i hadn't been conscious at all to the previous instances, like, i *had* engaged with it- seen it take birth, acknowledge it with a ""hmm, possible reason"" and kind of let it go without much thought, i hadn't become ""consciously conscious"" if i have to put it that way until now. today, i saw the thought come, and ""caught"" it, and became ""more"" conscious, and am writing about it promptly so are there different ""types"" of thoughts

8. arriving at the wrong conclusion... if someone sees me not talking much in, say a party, they will form a 'hypothesis' that i'm a shy introvert who doesn't want humans. they perform 'experiments', establish 'repeatability' by making me sit in different situations (and unknown to them, implicitly, in groups). they then come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is indeed correct. ""scientifically"", ""data-driven""

but that conclusion is wrong... partially at least i'm that way in *groups*. 1-1, i'm much more comfortable. someone comes across this - like how it was discovered newton's laws don't apply on the quantum level, and only then do they realize the incompleteness of the conclusion.

how do we make the jump - circling around the evidence and suddenly, making the leap to the conclusion, or in a more mathematical manner which i thought of some days back - treating all the evidence as input, how do we design a function that will produce the right conclusion? f(evidence)=conclusion?

i think this is where falsifiability works nicely... some good scientist will seek to actively disprove the hypothesis, and try whatever he can to do so, and in some time, will come across a situation that does so... and if all his attempts are rendered useless, perhaps he could come to the (provisional!) conclusion that i am a shy introvert who doesn't want humans...

(i mean, even now, the conclusion is kind of wrong... it's not like i don't want humans. i desperately seek a deep connection, so when i see it not being fulfilled anywhere around me (in a particular context - say, a schoolmates meeting, and in general too), i don't speak much, and don't appear invested or engaged because i feel it won't lead to anything useful. how do you find \*that\*

9. Was helping him out, for 9 hours almost straight, with one break . Around 11:45, he asked me to stop doing it coz he had to leave. Now, i should have immediately stopped then and there, coz he himself asked me to, and sighed a heave of relief. After all, it's a chore for me, i have nothing to gain from it. But, i insisted on continuing, wanted to finish that task. I still had a bit left at that time, and I didn't want to leave it unfinished. Why the determination to finish it?

One could be a form of perfectionism... The unfinished task would irk me. One simple conclusion (perhaps the one that he, and most people if they'd seen me helping him out, would walk away with) is that I'm just a kind, helpful person and I wanted him to do well, but i don't want to buy this yet.

Some sort of power in helping (do i want someone to feel better, or do *I* want to be the one making them feel better?)? *I* become the reason he possibly scores more marks. In other words, *I* held the power over his marks to an extent.

10. i've kept oscillating b/w reading literature->but i should ""fertilize and till the mind""->lit theory->but wait i also need philosophy to evaluate arguments->but i feel lonely and sad so i need hobbies->back to lit for happiness. and the cycle does on

lol not to forget the ""elon read physics when he was 12 you're reading because you want mushy teen wattpad"" and declaring literature as a waste of time and going back to philosophy only to feel lonely again and think of coming back to lit

11. Was fine initially , although not fully present still... Just forcing laughter and smiles and conversations... But as time passed, especially after food i really wanted to leave and be alone. But I had to stay there... They were talking to others and I didn't know what to do, kept pacing around, with a blank expression on my face. Wanted to... Hit something with a bat, was getting frustrated... There was a bottle in my hand and i kept flinging it from hand to hand rather forcefully, and sometimes trying to squeeze it with my hand...

On more than one occasion I felt like tearing up... Fkn college has sucked all the joy out of life and it's been a fucking miserable 3 years, only to end up here, with almost no job no grades no friends no love fkn hell...

12. was in the review meeting with R. initially it was fine.. doing ok only, working on the edits but as time went by... started becoming dull, wasn't listening to him as intently, just nodding along instead of sharing my inputs as well, and he might have noticed i was visibly duller, i probably would have used the age old excuse of being sleepy..

was walking back, and this time i wasn't even feeling lonely (i know how loneliness feels, i want her {her is not any specific, real person, but an imaginary companion i sometimes \[fine not sometimes\] think of to cope} beside me to hug me, this time i didn't really want it, and even picturing her didn't help much when it is clear that it \*would\* help if she were by me). just slowly trudged along with a dull, indifferent expression. reached my room and had a couple of tears for absolutely no reason. i just was feeling very less enthusiastic and automaticity also went down... i had to kickstart my limbs from the usual halt when, say, eating the snack... the hand just stopped midway. twitched a couple of times.

13. was feeling empty as usual, tried to talk with people on the group, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing...convulsive gasps

was muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore"" (went back to 3rd sem...i think it started in 1st sem, but it hadn't become this intense, just signs - ""how to make friends"", ""frientimacy"" such videos.)

hope kept dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. (remembered the image which was eerily similar to mine. )

thought of asking for help...from my college sub. even from someone irl. wanted to cry on someone's shoulder while being held. not some nobody, but someone who'd get it...

If you've made it to here, thanks for reading it! and if you resonate... you know what to do! I'd like to have a deep connection... just posting it here, because why not XD",1,1767100391.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,1.0,False

Hate. 

The English dictionary defines it as “intense or passionate dislike” 

But if you ask me? 

Hate is the heat in my blood when I see his face. 

It’s the twitch in my eye when he walks past with that infuriating calm like the world bends for him. 

Hate is… Atlas freaking Lawson. 

I stared down at the paper in my hand. 

99%. 

Not bad. Actually, excellent. For most people, it would be celebration-worthy. 

But not today.

Because across the room, sitting like some broody Greek god with a pen behind his ear and zero awareness of personal space, was Atlas Lawson. 

And taped to the top corner of his paper? 

Of course. 

Of course he got a perfect score. 

I didn’t realize I was burning holes into the side of his head until he looked up. 

Our eyes met. 

His lips twitched. 

A smile. 

A small, smug, soul-crushing smile. 

And then he turned to his friend and said something that made im laugh. 

Like I was invisible. Like he hadn’t just one-upped me for the eighth time this semester. 

That’s it. 

That’s it. 

I was about to lose my freaking mind. 

“I swear,” I muttered through clenched teeth, “if he smirks at me one more time, I’m going to shove this test paper down his

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday. 

\*\*\* 

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport. I’m the “teacher’s favorite,” the “golden girl,” the one with the heart of gold, as Mrs. Benson once said while dabbing tears from her eyes at the spring award ceremony. 

All A’s. 

Captain of the swim team. 

Medals? I lost count.

I remember the first day he transferred.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away. 

My smile faltered. My stomach twisted.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

Turns out, Atlas stupid, annoying jerk-face Lawson wasn’t just a ockey prodigy with lips wornen would write songs about. 

Nope. 

He was smart. 

So smart, in fact, that he managed to do the unthinkable, push e to second place in our final GPA rankings. 

SECOND place! 

Me. 

That had never happened. Not in Preschool, not in Elementary school, not in middle school, and certainly not in my entire four years of high-functioning, overachieving, anxiety-powered high school life. 

And now, on graduation day, I sat there in my cap and gown, clapping like a good little graduate while the Dean called out 

his name. 

“And now, it’s my honor to recognize the student who has achieved the highest academic distinction in the graduating class of 2024. This year’s Valedictorian, with the highest cumulative GPA, is Atlas Lawson!” 

Cue the thunderous applause. 

I rolled my eyes so hard I swear I saw the inside of my

Walking across the stage like he owned the damn planet. The crowd loved it. Even the parents behind me murmured, “he’s so handsome” and “what a bright young man.” 

Barf. 

Gag me with a diploma. 

But no. I wasn’t going to let him ruin this moment. This was my graduation too. And I had other things to be happy about… real things. 

Like my amazing friends. 

My loyal boyfriend Kevin. 

My bright, glittering future. 

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

Oh yeah.

My dad is dating Atlas Lawson’s mom. 

Yup.

My actual father. 

Dating the mother of my academic nemesis. 

The human migraine that has haunted my educational career.

A bit of background:

* I’m originally from the Midwest (Milwaukee), so winter weather doesn’t intimidate us.
* We’re currently in North Carolina, living near three major universities, and have really come to value the energy, culture, and resources that come with university towns.
* We’re used to public transportation and are hoping to use a car as little as possible.
* Ideally, we’d like to live near WMU, or at least in an area where campus, food, and daily needs are easily accessible on foot or by transit.

What we’re looking for:

* A walkable neighborhood with character (coffee, restaurants, arts, campus-adjacent life)
* A house with a garage and enough space for two separate art studio/work areas
* A community with some cultural life... art, lectures, music, interesting food

We’ve noticed that home prices in and around the town, at least thru Zillow, seem lower than expected for a college town, which made us curious and eager to understand the context from people who actually live there. One of my kids said that areas might be like where he lives in San Francisco where it's ""affordable"" and I got to making this post.

I’d love insight on:

* Neighborhoods that fit what we’re describing
* Areas locals recommend  and more especially would avoid
* How realistic a low-car or car-light lifestyle is
* Whether affordability reflects tradeoffs we should understand

We’re not chasing luxury just more livability, creativity, and community.

I’m in the early stages of exploring a small-scale coffee roasting hobby>business and would really value insight from people who’ve actually done it.

This isn’t a “get rich quick” idea or a rush to scale — I’m more interested in learning how to roast great coffee and building something thoughtful and sustainable: small batch, quality-driven, maybe local/direct-to-consumer to start. I come from a design/build background and enjoy process, iteration, and craftsmanship, so roasting feels like a natural extension of that mindset.

Before going too far, I’d love to hear from those who’ve been down this road:

– What do you wish you understood *before* buying your first roaster?  
– What assumptions did you have that turned out to be wrong?  
– What parts of running a micro-roastery surprised you the most (time, margins, stress, regulations, logistics, etc.)?  
– At what scale did things start to feel “real” rather than experimental?  
– Any big mistakes or expensive lessons you’d warn others about?  
– For those selling small volumes: what actually moved the needle early on?

I’m especially curious about the less glamorous parts — compliance, ventilation, sourcing green coffee, consistency, customer expectations, and whether the joy of roasting held up once money entered the picture.

Not trying to chase trends or build a huge brand — more interested in doing something well, sustainably, and without burning out.

Really appreciate any honest perspectives, even if the advice is “don’t do it unless \_\_\_.”

Happy holidays, Reddit! I just got back from a trip home and am in that weird limbo between Christmas Eve and the new year where time has no meaning and I'm beginning to lose track of what day it is. Instead of my usual doom-scrolling through social media and dating apps (which feel especially depressing during the holidays), I figured I'd try something different: shouting into the void and seeing [who...or](http://who...or/) what...what shouts back.

I'm happily single but not lonely—just realizing that the holidays hit different when you can share the small stuff. The first sip of really good coffee on a cold morning. Finding a great movie that actually lives up to the hype. Debating whether fruitcake deserves its terrible reputation (spoiler: yes it does). That sort of thing.

A bit about me: I'm originally from overseas, accent included (which usually gets compliments). I stay active through cycling, hiking, and ambitious winter walks that probably look a bit mad to my neighbors. I love being intentional with my downtime—whether that's a morning spent reading while the world still sleeps or finally nailing that recipe I've been meaning to try.

Speaking of which: I bake. A lot. Chocolate cake, fresh bread, cookies that disappear suspiciously fast. My roast potatoes have been described as ""inappropriately good"" and the holiday season gives me an excellent excuse to feed people.

I'm always hunting for good book recommendations to get through the rest of winter—just finished two and need to restock. Same goes for movies, TV shows, or podcasts that'll make these shorter days more bearable.

I'm not looking for anything specific here. No checklists, no dealbreakers, no grand expectations. Just hoping to find someone interesting to talk to during the holiday downtime. Maybe that's great conversation and some laughs. Maybe it's a new friendship. Maybe, eventually, it's a bit more.

If any of this sounds appealing—or if you're just avoiding relatives and need a distraction—send me a message. Bonus points if you have strong opinions about whether *Die Hard* counts as a Christmas movie (this *may* be a dealbreaker).",0,1767100129.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

I'm new to the game. I'm collecting, but enjoying playing just as much. I started playing Gholdengo ex primarily and built myself a deck so I could go try a tourney or two. I was easily eclipsing 60% win rate in casual. But then I learn about rotation and realize before I even go to a tourney that my ace is dying in a few months. I really want to nail down MY DECK, and get it down to a science per se. 

I play a few matches with Mega Sharpedo and realize that it's somewhat similar to the Gholdengo deck and that I play quite well with it as well. I see a few cards are going to drop out at rotation but didn't look at all of them. Since Mega Sharpedo is a new card, the deck should be fresh and playable for a long time right? 

Well as I'm looking this morning it's more than just a few cards that are dropping out. Arven, Iono, Nest Ball, Purrloin, Jacq, Defiance Band....maybe more idk. 

So I guess my questions are this....

Is standard (rather than extended decks) what I will play in the majority of events, including local leagues and what not?

Are there other playable versions of any of the G cards I have showing? 

Do we seriously cut out 20 percent of our decks every year?

After 93 and a bit years of terrific health and 5 less-good months, my dad’s dad died. It has been a week since his funeral.

He was a tremendous Aussie bloke. A classic larrikin. Had a huge family,  was a wizard in the shed, and still did 3 sports a week (down from 5 at 88). The last of his siblings, first, and second cousins (130 people all up on his generation). Loving and much loved.

My mum’s dad is a stoic. An intelligent and usually very serious Balkan. The kind of guy wearing a 3-piece suit to get a coffee with his friends in a mall. At 91, he is also the patriarch, but is less ‘3 sports a week’ and more ‘newspaper and news channel’. When I teared up on my wedding day, he shook his head and told me to “be strong”.

Anyway, today, I saw members of mum’s side of the family. The 5 hour round trip prevented most of them from attending the funeral, and my wife and I did Christmas etc. with other parts of our families, so it’s been a few weeks and most people gave condolences. Notably, my grandfather did not comment, and he usually has a weigh-in on everything.

After dinner this evening, I gave my mum’s dad a hug, thanked him, and said “I felt like I needed a hug from my grandfather this week”.

He looked at me and said “Well, I will give you two” and he \*HELD\* me with a strength I didn’t know he had. He kept me there for a few seconds, then offered a very Yugoslav kiss on each cheek, told me he loved me, and then kissed me on the forehead. After that, he held my head in his hands and we nodded at each other as we teared up. I have not seen him well-up with tears since my grandmother died years ago.

He said some kind words about my other grandfather. Emphasised that he was a good man, and that he was lucky to know him, I was lucky to know him, and that my dad was very lucky to be able to call on his own dad for advice until he was almost 70. I smiled and thanked my grandfather in his language, but did so clumsily enough that I elicited a laugh and he patted me on the back as we (very slowly, these days) walked back to the car.

TL;DR: All up, a few seconds that will stick with me. My very serious (but very loving) grandfather offering me two hugs because I can no longer hug my other grandfather.",108,1767100025.0,BenignExistence,8,1.0,False

So few days back, I had met her in the evening just to chill and we ended up going on a drive while vibing to songs. On my playlist is this song called 'Sarà perchè ti amo' which is not in a language either of us speak, I heard it on Instagram and felt it was upbeat and vibe-y so I added it to my usual playlist. 

So when this song started to play she wanted to know what it was, and I told her I didn't even know what language it was in, which was the truth. So she googled it and it turned out to mean ""It must be because I love you"" in Italian.

Now, my dumb brain didn't really get this at the time and I just mentioned something like 'oh really, okay.' and then mentioned something about lovey-dovey songs being boring. We both laughed it off. We then had a nice walk and a coffee after our drive and then she went home. There's been nothing to indicate any sort of awkwardness from her end so far, as we continue to share memes with each other.

1pzhlsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1pzhlsx/i_procrastinated_on_everything_important_for_6/,"I procrastinated on everything important for 6 years, here’s how I finally stopped","


I’m 27. For the last 6 years of my life, I procrastinated on literally everything that mattered.

Important work project due? I’d start it the night before in a panic. Doctor’s appointment I needed to schedule? Put it off for 8 months. Bills that needed paying? Waited until I got late notices. Difficult conversations I needed to have? Avoided them until the relationship fell apart.

I wasn’t lazy in the traditional sense. I was always doing something. I just wasn’t doing the things I actually needed to do.

Instead of working on important tasks, I’d reorganize my desk. Clean my room. Research the perfect productivity system. Watch videos about how to stop procrastinating. Do busy work that felt productive but accomplished nothing.

I was a master at looking busy while avoiding anything that actually mattered.

This destroyed my life in ways I didn’t even realize until recently. Lost job opportunities because I missed deadlines. Ruined relationships because I avoided difficult conversations. Stayed unhealthy because I procrastinated on doctor visits and eating right. Stayed broke because I put off working on my career.

Every single important area of my life suffered because I couldn’t make myself do hard things until they became emergencies.

THE PROCRASTINATION LIFE

It started in college. I’d have a paper due in 3 weeks. Plenty of time. I’d tell myself I’d start early this time, really plan it out, do it right.

Day 1, I’d think about the paper but not start it. Still had 3 weeks.

Week 1, I’d do some light research. Bookmark some articles I’d definitely read later. Feel productive.

Week 2, I’d outline the paper. Feel good about making progress. Then not touch it for another week.

Night before it was due, I’d panic and write the entire thing in 6 hours fueled by energy drinks and anxiety. Turn it in at 11:58pm. Get a B minus.

Every single time. I knew exactly how much time I had before panic mode kicked in and I’d use every second of it to avoid the work.

Graduated college and the pattern continued into real life except now the stakes were higher.

Got a job in project management. Good salary, decent company. I was smart enough to do the work well. But I’d procrastinate on everything until the last possible moment.

Had a presentation due Friday? I’d start making the slides Thursday night. Had to review a document by Monday? I’d do it Monday morning. Had a difficult email to send? I’d rewrite it 30 times and still not send it.

My boss noticed. Started missing me off important projects because he couldn’t trust me to deliver on time. That hurt but not enough to change.

Got let go after a year. They said it was downsizing but I knew it was my procrastination. They kept people who delivered consistently and cut people who were unreliable.

Next job, same thing. Smart enough to get hired, too much of a procrastinator to keep the job. Lasted 8 months.

After that I did freelance work because at least I couldn’t get fired. But I’d take on projects and procrastinate until clients got pissed. Lost clients constantly. Made barely enough to survive.

My personal life was the same disaster. Needed to go to the dentist, put it off for 3 years until I had a cavity that needed a root canal. Needed to have a serious talk with my girlfriend about our relationship, avoided it for months until she broke up with me. Needed to file my taxes, waited until the last day and then filed for an extension.

Everything important got pushed to tomorrow. Tomorrow became next week. Next week became next month. Next month became never or became a crisis.

I was 27 and had accomplished almost nothing because I spent 6 years avoiding everything that actually mattered.

WHY I PROCRASTINATED ON EVERYTHING

Used to think I was just bad at time management or needed better systems. Tried every productivity app and method. GTD, Pomodoro, time blocking, bullet journaling. Nothing worked.

Finally realized procrastination wasn’t about time management. It was about emotion management.

I procrastinated on important things because they made me uncomfortable. The bigger and more important the task, the more anxiety it caused, the more I avoided it.

Work project that mattered? Scary because I might fail or it might not be good enough. So I’d avoid it and do easy tasks instead.

Difficult conversation? Scary because of potential conflict or rejection. So I’d put it off until it exploded.

Doctor appointment? Scared they’d find something wrong. So I just didn’t go.

Job applications? Scared of rejection. So I’d research and prepare forever but never actually apply.

I was avoiding discomfort. My brain learned that procrastination provided short term relief from anxiety. Do something easy and feel good now, deal with consequences later.

The problem is later always comes. And when it does, the consequences are worse and the anxiety is worse and now I’m in crisis mode.

Also I had zero accountability. No one was checking on me. No external pressure until deadlines hit. So I’d drift along procrastinating because there were no consequences until it was too late.

My dopamine system was fucked too. Between social media, video games, and YouTube, I could get instant gratification any time I wanted. Working on something hard and important for unclear future payoff couldn’t compete with the easy dopamine hit of scrolling TikTok.

I’d built a life where avoiding important things was easy and doing important things was hard.

PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS TO STOP

Tried to fix this so many times over the years.

Attempt 1, made elaborate to do lists every day. Felt productive making the lists. Never actually did the important items. Just did the easy quick tasks so I could check boxes.

Attempt 2, used the Pomodoro technique. Worked for one day. Then I’d start a Pomodoro for an important task and spend the whole 25 minutes on Twitter instead.

Attempt 3, told myself I’d do the hardest thing first every day. Did that exactly once. Every other day I’d convince myself I needed to ease into the day with easier tasks first.

Attempt 4, tried habit stacking and morning routines. Built great routines around easy things like making coffee and working out. Still procrastinated on actual important work.

Attempt 5, hired an accountability coach. Told him I’d get things done. Then lied to him about my progress because I was too embarrassed to admit I’d procrastinated again.

Nothing worked because I was treating the symptoms instead of the root cause. I wasn’t building the ability to do uncomfortable things. I was just trying different ways to trick myself into being productive.

THE ACTUAL TURNING POINT

My dad came to visit. He’s 64, retired last year from a career he actually built. We were talking and he asked what I was working on.

Gave him some vague answer about freelance projects and figuring things out.

He said, you know when I was your age I procrastinated on everything too. Cost me my first marriage and almost cost me my career. Took me years to figure out that I was just scared.

That hit different. My dad never talked about his failures. And the idea that procrastination was about fear, not laziness or bad habits, made something click.

I wasn’t procrastinating because I was lazy or disorganized. I was procrastinating because I was scared of discomfort and failure and I’d never learned how to push through those feelings.

Started researching procrastination from that angle. Found this video from a guy who’d overcome chronic procrastination by building what he called discomfort tolerance. The ability to do hard things even when every part of you wants to avoid them.

He said you can’t think your way out of procrastination. You have to train yourself to act despite discomfort. And you need external structure because your brain will always find excuses.

He mentioned using an app called Reload that forces you to complete daily tasks and blocks escape routes during work hours. It builds the discipline to do uncomfortable things through progressive difficulty.

That made sense. Every time I’d tried to stop procrastinating before, I relied on motivation or willpower. Which worked until the task made me uncomfortable, then I’d find any excuse to avoid it.

Downloaded the app and set it up. Told it my main issue was procrastinating on important tasks. My goals were to stop procrastinating, build the ability to do hard things, complete important work on time, stop avoiding uncomfortable situations.

It generated a 60 day program that started with tasks that seemed almost too easy.

Week 1, do one important task within 5 minutes of thinking about it. Work on your most important project for just 15 minutes. Send one message or email you’ve been avoiding. That’s it.

The app also blocked my usual escape apps during work hours. No Twitter, no YouTube, no Reddit, no TikTok. Couldn’t procrastinate by scrolling when I was supposed to be working.

MONTH 1, LEARNING TO START

Week 1 to 2, the 5 minute rule changed everything. I’d think about doing something important and instead of adding it to my list for later, I had to start it within 5 minutes.

Didn’t have to finish it. Just had to start. That removed the pressure that usually made me procrastinate.

Needed to send a difficult email? Had to open my email and start writing within 5 minutes. Usually by the time I started I’d just finish it because starting was the hard part.

The 15 minutes of important work thing worked because it was manageable. I could do anything for 15 minutes. Couldn’t tell myself I needed a 4 hour block of perfect focus time.

My apps being blocked during work hours eliminated my escape routes. Usually when something felt uncomfortable I’d open Twitter or YouTube without even thinking. Now I couldn’t. Had to sit with the discomfort instead of avoiding it.

Week 3 to 4, tasks ramped up slightly. Do three important tasks within 5 minutes. Work on most important project for 30 minutes. Have one uncomfortable conversation you’ve been avoiding.

That conversation one was brutal. I’d been avoiding talking to a client about late payment for 2 months. Finally sent the message. Client apologized and paid immediately. I’d built up this huge anxiety about it and it took 5 minutes to resolve.

Started noticing a pattern. The things I procrastinated on the most took way less time and were way less painful than I’d built them up to be in my head. The anticipation was worse than the actual task.

MONTH 2, BUILDING MOMENTUM

Week 5 to 6, increased to 45 minutes on important work. Five important tasks done within 5 minutes of thinking about them. Two uncomfortable tasks per week.

Was actually getting things done for the first time in years. Not perfectly, not always on time, but way more consistently than before.

Applied for three jobs I’d been putting off. Got interviews for two. That never would’ve happened if I kept procrastinating.

Scheduled the doctor appointments I’d been avoiding for over a year. Dentist, physical, everything. Turned out I was fine, I’d just been anxious for no reason.

Had difficult conversations I’d been putting off. Some went well, some didn’t, but at least they were done instead of hanging over my head.

Week 7 to 8, hit my first real test. Had a big freelance project due in two weeks. Old me would’ve procrastinated until the last 2 days and done a shit job.

The app had me work on it for 90 minutes every day starting immediately. No waiting for the perfect time or the right mood. Just show up and work.

Did it. Finished the project 3 days early. Client was shocked. I was shocked. First time in 6 years I’d finished something important early instead of in a panic at the last second.

The ranked mode in the app kept me motivated. Seeing my consistency score go up made me want to keep the streak going. Gamified following through instead of procrastinating.

MONTH 3 TO 5, ACTUALLY CHANGING

Month 3, the tasks were legitimately challenging. Work on important projects for 2 hours daily. Complete all important tasks same day you identify them. Do one thing you’ve been procrastinating on for over a month.

That last one made me face things I’d been avoiding for way too long. Taxes I hadn’t filed. Friendships I’d let die because I avoided reaching out. Career moves I’d been too scared to make.

Started filing my overdue taxes. Reached out to old friends. Applied for jobs I actually wanted instead of just taking whatever was easy.

Month 4, got offered a job at a company I actually wanted to work for. Good salary, interesting work, growth potential. The kind of opportunity I would’ve fucked up in the past by procrastinating during the interview process.

This time I prepared early. Responded to emails promptly. Did the take home assignment immediately instead of waiting until the night before. Got the offer.

Month 5, started the new job. Old me would’ve procrastinated there too and gotten let go within a year. New me was completing work ahead of schedule. My manager actually commented on how reliable I was.

That felt surreal. Reliable. Me. The guy who’d been fired from two jobs for procrastinating.

WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 7 months since I started actually addressing my procrastination instead of just feeling bad about it.

I still procrastinate sometimes. It’s not completely gone. But instead of procrastinating on everything important for weeks or months, I might put something off for a day before I make myself do it.

Got promoted at my job last month. Three months in and I got promoted because I was consistently delivering good work on time. That never would’ve happened before.

My personal life is better too. I handle things when they come up instead of letting them build into disasters. Schedule appointments when I need them. Have difficult conversations when they’re needed. Pay bills on time. File my taxes early.

Still use Reload daily because the structure keeps me from slipping back. The app blocking during work hours keeps me from escaping into social media. The daily tasks keep me doing important things instead of just easy things.

Most importantly, I can make myself do uncomfortable things now. That’s the real change. I’m not waiting for motivation or the perfect moment. I just do the thing even when I don’t want to.

My dad visited again last week. Asked how things were going. I actually had real accomplishments to tell him about instead of vague excuses. He said he could see the difference. That meant a lot.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT PROCRASTINATION

Procrastination isn’t about time management or productivity systems. It’s about avoiding emotional discomfort. You procrastinate on things that make you anxious or scared or uncomfortable.

You can’t think your way out of it. You have to build the ability to act despite discomfort. That’s a skill you develop through practice, not something you fix with the right app or method.

The anticipation is always worse than the actual task. The difficult email, the uncomfortable conversation, the important project. They’re never as bad as the anxiety you build up avoiding them.

Starting is the hardest part. Once you actually start the thing you’ve been procrastinating on, momentum carries you through. It’s the gap between thinking about it and starting that kills you.

You need external structure when your internal discipline is broken. You can’t rely on willpower or motivation to overcome years of procrastination habits. You need systems that force you to follow through.

Remove your escape routes. As long as you can easily scroll social media or watch YouTube when things get uncomfortable, you’ll choose that over doing hard things. Block the exits.

Small wins build momentum. One important task done on time leads to another. One uncomfortable conversation handled well makes the next one easier. The confidence compounds.

Procrastination is usually protecting you from something. Fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of success, fear of discomfort. You have to figure out what you’re actually avoiding and face it directly.

You can’t wait until you feel like it. You’ll never feel like doing the hard uncomfortable important things. You do them anyway and the feelings follow.

IF YOU PROCRASTINATE LIKE I DID

Stop lying to yourself about why you procrastinate. It’s not because you work better under pressure or you’re waiting for the right time. You’re avoiding discomfort.

Identify the one thing you’ve been procrastinating on the longest. The thing that makes you most uncomfortable to think about. That’s what you need to do first.

Use the 5 minute rule. When you think about doing something important, start it within 5 minutes. Don’t add it to a list for later. Start now even if you don’t finish.

Block your escape apps during work hours. Remove the ability to avoid discomfort by scrolling. Make it harder to procrastinate than to just do the work.

Start with 15 minutes on the important thing. You can do anything for 15 minutes. Don’t wait for hours of perfect focus time. Just do 15 minutes now.

Build external accountability. An app, a person, a public commitment. Something outside yourself that creates pressure to follow through.

Do the uncomfortable thing first. The difficult email, the hard conversation, the scary task. Get it done early before you have time to build up anxiety about it.

Track what you complete, not what you plan to do. Your to do list doesn’t matter. What matters is what you actually finished today.

Accept that doing the thing will feel uncomfortable and do it anyway. You’re not waiting for it to feel easy. You’re building the ability to act despite discomfort.

Give yourself 60 days of actually following through before you judge if you can change. Not 3 days. Not 2 weeks. Two full months of doing hard things consistently.

I spent 6 years procrastinating on everything that mattered and it destroyed my career, my relationships, and my potential. I’m 7 months into actually doing uncomfortable things and my life is completely different.

Stop waiting for tomorrow. What’s the one important thing you’ve been procrastinating on that you could start right now?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1767099826.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

James had never committed a crime before. He scanned the park for witnesses before stashing his bike in a bush and ducking behind it for cover. A shiny new sign reflecting the streetlight read: ""No Trespassing. Property of Suncorp,"" which made his blood boil and burned away any remaining doubts. Even though taking back something that was his hardly felt like a crime, Suncorp made it clear that they wouldn't take it easy on trespassers. A week before, they had pulled a kid out of the barbed wire who had been hanging upside-down for nearly half an hour and put him in a police car instead of an ambulance, and he was just trying to get a soccer ball. 

James searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped and peeked back over the bush. He quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line, squeezed through the flap, and disappeared into the trees beyond. 

The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread he had stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

 James ran up to the tree and gave It a hug, pressing his cheek into the rough bark. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings, wondering what was happening on the other side of the new fence. He couldn't wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

 James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intact and intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

 Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Most importantly, a map of Alaska with pins marking several locations along the northern edge was still hanging on the wall above a locked drawer. James walked over and opened the drawer with a key. He shuffled through maps, news articles, and letters until he got to an article that read: “Wildlife Videographer Missing in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”.

He picked it up and looked at the last known photo of his father dressed in a thick coat with a fur-lined hood and a big smile. His eyes jumped down to the highlighted words: No body has been found. 

""I'll find out what happened to you,"" James whispered. He gulped down his emotions, took down the poster, and neatly tucked everything from the drawer into his backpack.

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

""That should do it,"" he said with a smile. ""We're watching you now.""

James took one last look around before leaving. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad's old coffee cans. Building the treehouse helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

He blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders, and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that led him deeper toward the pounding machines. Nobody knew exactly what Suncorp was doing or why the County decided to sell them the last remaining forest, but the ten-foot fence and the way they threw money at local workers without telling them what they were building didn't sit well with James.

Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. It wouldn't be long before he would lose the cover of darkness, so he picked up his pace. The hammering and grinding grew louder, and work lights began to appear through the trees. He was close to finally seeing what they were building but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead.

James crouched low and stared into the understory and listened. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods around him were silent aside from Suncorp's machines, so his heart nearly stopped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James almost took off running, but he was trapped between them and the build site. He stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote, who both scanned him with just as much curiosity. Several minutes passed, and nobody moved.

""Hi,"" James eventually said, breaking the silence.

The boy continued to stare at James, not speaking.

""Are you with Suncorp?"" James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.  

""Wait! Don't go!"" James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.  

""I don't like them either,"" James said. ""I don't know what they're up to, but it can't be good. I'm going to film them, and if they do anything shady, I'll send it out to every news station in Ohio.""

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

""What is that? Over your shoulder,"" James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. ""I've never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower bud hit the ground and exploded into a blinding light, leaving behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him again, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?""

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to reveal a bundle of roots in his palm, with an exotic-looking flower bobbing on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward from a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An unusual bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered whether he should chase after him, but at this point, he had to get back to the fence before it was fully light outside. James dashed back down the trail, passed the treehouse, and slid through the fence hole. He stitched the hole back up by twisting some wire and biked into the neighborhood just as the streetlights clicked off",1,1767099709.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

1pzhcb5,https://i.redd.it/gjcuglfv8cag1.jpeg,"My Job is to Eat Shrimp, or What I Thought Was Shrimp","I’ve always been a creature of habit. Wake up at 5:30 AM, brew a pot of black coffee strong enough to strip paint, and head out to whatever dead-end job pays the bills. For the past six months, that job has been at Oceanic Delicacies, a sprawling warehouse on the outskirts of Port Haven, a foggy coastal town in Maine where the air always smells like salt and decay. The gig? Quality control tester for shrimp. Yeah, you heard that right. My job is to eat shrimp. Or at least, what I thought was shrimp.

It started innocently enough. I saw the ad on a job board online: “No experience necessary. Competitive pay. Must have a strong stomach and no seafood allergies.” I figured, why not? I’d been laid off from my last position at a cannery—something about automation replacing human hands—and my savings were dwindling faster than the tide recedes. The interview was a joke: a quick chat with a bored HR rep named Marlene, who handed me a form and a pen. “Sign here, and you’re in,” she said, her eyes glazed like she’d repeated the line a thousand times.

The warehouse was massive, a labyrinth of conveyor belts, humming freezers, and the constant clatter of machinery. My station was in a sterile white room at the back, isolated from the main floor. It was called the “Tasting Lab,” but it felt more like a clinical exam room—fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, a metal table with a stool, and a one-way mirror on the wall that I swore someone was always watching from behind. Every day, I’d clock in, don a hairnet and gloves, and wait for the samples.

The process was simple: A slot in the wall would open, and a tray would slide out with ten to fifteen shrimp, peeled and deveined, sometimes raw, sometimes cooked in various seasonings. I’d eat them one by one, noting texture, flavor, freshness on a digital tablet. Too salty? Mark it. Rubbery? Flag it. Off-putting aftertaste? Report it. Then, the tray would retract, and another would appear. Eight hours a day, five days a week. It was monotonous, but the pay was $25 an hour, plus benefits. In Port Haven, that was a king’s ransom.

At first, I loved it. Shrimp had always been a guilty pleasure—cocktail shrimp at parties, shrimp scampi on date nights back when I had those. The samples were premium: plump, juicy, with that briny snap you only get from fresh catch. I’d chew slowly, savoring the burst of ocean flavor, the subtle sweetness beneath the salt. My notes were glowing: “Excellent firmness,” “Perfect balance of umami,” “No fishy undertone.” I even started dreaming about shrimp—endless platters floating in a sea of cocktail sauce.

But around week three, things got… weird. It started with the textures. One batch felt off, like the meat was too fibrous, almost stringy, as if threads of something tougher were woven in. I noted it: “Slightly chewy, possible over-processing.” The next day, another tray came with shrimp that wriggled faintly when I picked them up. I blinked, thinking it was a trick of the light, but no—tiny spasms, like they weren’t quite dead. “Residual nerve activity?” I typed, my fingers hesitating. In the cannery days, I’d seen fish twitch post-mortem, but shrimp? They were supposed to be inert.

I mentioned it to Marlene during my weekly check-in. She laughed it off, her voice tinny over the intercom. “Oh, that’s just the new sourcing. We’re testing deep-sea varieties—fresher than fresh. Keeps the flavor locked in.” I nodded, but a seed of doubt planted itself. Deep-sea shrimp? I’d never heard of such a thing being commercially viable. Port Haven’s waters were shallow, battered by storms, not the abyssal depths.

As weeks turned to months, the anomalies piled up. Some shrimp had an iridescent sheen, like oil on water, shifting colors under the lights—blue to green to purple. Others tasted metallic, a coppery tang that lingered on my tongue for hours. I started getting headaches after shifts, pounding migraines that blurred my vision. At home, I’d collapse on my couch, staring at the ceiling, feeling like something was crawling under my skin.

One night, after a particularly odd batch—shrimp that popped like caviar when bitten, releasing a viscous fluid—I dreamed vividly. I was underwater, in a vast, dark ocean trench. Bioluminescent shapes darted around me, not fish, but elongated things with too many segments, glowing eyes clustered in rows. They pulsed with light, beckoning. I reached out, and one latched onto my hand, its mouthparts unfolding like petals. I woke up gasping, my palm itching where nothing was there.

The next shift, the trays came faster. No breaks between them. I’d barely finish logging one batch before another slid out. The shrimp were larger now, almost prawn-sized, with veins that pulsed faintly under the translucent flesh. I bit into one, and it squirted—warm, not cold like it should be. The flavor was richer, almost creamy, with an undercurrent of something earthy, like soil after rain mixed with blood.

I flagged it: “Unusual temperature—sample warm upon arrival. Flavor profile altered.” No response from the intercom. Usually, Marlene or someone would chime in with excuses. Silence.

My body had started to change. I noticed it in the mirror one morning: my skin looked paler, veins more prominent, especially around my neck and wrists. Blueish lines threading under the surface. I itched constantly, scratching until I bled. The headaches evolved into something worse—whispers, faint at first, like static in my ears. Words I couldn’t make out, bubbling up from somewhere deep.

At work, the one-way mirror seemed to fog sometimes, as if breath was on the other side. I’d catch glimpses of movement in the reflection, shadows shifting when I wasn’t looking directly. The shrimp—God, the shrimp—started looking different. Not just in texture or taste, but shape. Some had extra ridges along the tail, tiny protrusions like nascent limbs. Others had what looked like eyespots, dark dots that followed me as I lifted them to my mouth.

I tried to quit once. Went to Marlene’s office after a shift, my tablet clutched in shaking hands. “This isn’t right,” I said. “The samples… they’re not normal shrimp.” She smiled, that same glazed expression. “Nonsense. You’re our best tester. Top scores every week. Here’s a bonus.” She slid an envelope across the desk—$500 cash. I took it. Bills don’t pay themselves.

That night, the itching intensified. In the shower, I scratched my forearm raw, and something moved beneath the skin. A ripple, like a worm burrowing. I stared, water cascading over me, convinced it was hallucination. But no—it happened again. A small bulge traveling up my arm, then vanishing.

The dreams grew more frequent. Always the trench, the glowing creatures. But now, they spoke. Not with voices, but impressions—hunger, ancient patience, a promise of belonging. I’d wake with salt crust on my lips, even though I lived miles from the shore.

The trays never stopped. I’d eat hundreds a day, my stomach distending painfully, but I never felt full. The shrimp were alive now, unmistakably. They’d curl when touched, antennae—actual antennae—twitching. Some tried to escape the tray, scuttling toward the edge. I’d pin them with a fork, force them down. The taste was exquisite agony: sweet decay, electric vitality surging through me.

My notes became erratic: “Sample exhibits motility. Recommend halt.” “Flavor induces euphoria—potential contaminant.” “Eyes present. Multiple.” Still, silence from the intercom.

I started sneaking samples home. Wrapped in napkins, hidden in my lunch bag. Under my kitchen light, magnified with a cheap loupe I’d bought online, the truth stared back. They weren’t shrimp. Segmented bodies, jointed legs folded tight, mandibles tucked beneath. Larval forms, perhaps, of something much larger. Deep-sea horrors, harvested from trenches no sub should reach.

I searched online late at night, forums about cryptic marine life, leaked documents from oceanographic expeditions. Whispers of “benthic anomalies” caught in trawls off the continental shelf, things that mimicked commercial species to infiltrate supply chains. Parasites that rewrote hosts from within.

The itching spread everywhere. My back, my scalp, between my toes. In the mirror, my eyes had changed—pupils slightly elongated, irises flecked with that same iridescence.

One shift, the slot opened, but no tray came. Instead, a voice—finally—from the intercom. Not Marlene’s. Deeper, resonant, like pressure waves in water. “You’ve adapted well. Integration phase complete.”

The lights dimmed. The one-way mirror cleared, revealing not a observation room, but darkness. An abyss, lit by faint bioluminescence. Shapes moved beyond—massive, segmented, familiar.

I looked down at my hands. The skin split painlessly, peeling back like a shell. Beneath, something pale and jointed flexed. Legs? Feelers?

The tray arrived then, empty. An invitation.

I understood. My job wasn’t to test shrimp. It was to become the vessel. To carry them inland, spread the brood.

The whispers clarified: We are the tide that returns. You are the bridge.

I stepped toward the slot. It widened, accommodating. The air grew cold, briny.

As I crossed the threshold, into the wet dark beyond the wall, I felt the last of the old me slough away. Hunger remained—the eternal, patient hunger.

Back in the lab, a new stool waited. A new tablet. Soon, another applicant would sign the form.

I’m laying on this plate waiting for them. ",12,1767099097.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,7,1.0,False

   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*. ",2,1767099028.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pzhaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pzhaul/day_22_more_exciting_progress/,"Day 22, more exciting progress","Chronicling my decaf journey here on Reddit... now just over 3 weeks fully decaf. You can check out prior updates at [one week](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pnc19m/surprising_positive_effects_after_one_week/) and [two weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ptudgw/further_observations_at_day_15/). 

A few more positive developments have transpired, which I can detail below:

* The most exciting by far is that going fully decaf seems to have accelerated my recovery from a disc problem (herniated disc in my neck leading to a pinched nerve) that I have been working through for 2+ years. This caused moderate-to-strong pain and very significant loss of strength on my left side. Between PT, rest, and strength training I have gotten back maybe 90% of my original strength losses since the initial presentation, but at the two year mark I seemed to have plateaued (have been pressing practically the same weight for the last 6 months in the movements that are affected by the nerve damage, for example). I had also noticed over the past year that reducing caffeine would also reduce my neck pain, but it did not expect much to improve between low amounts of coffee (1-2 cups per day) and zero. Shockingly, however, in these past three weeks my neck pain has **completely disappeared** and suddenly my lifts have started rising again! I really cannot explain this other than by speculating that coffee/caffeine must be causing vasoconstriction and/or inflammation that has been getting in the way of nerve regrowth. This is **extremely** exciting and promising for my quality of life.
* Not to get too carried away here, but this almost has me wondering whether caffeine-induced chronic inflammation was the reason I experienced such a significant disc herniation in the first place. 
* One effect which seems negative but may actually be positive is that being off caffeine causes me to fully feel the negative effects of other substances like alcohol and cannabis. When I imbibe at night now, I really feel the negative impact on my sleep when I get up in the morning. (Versus in the past when a 20oz Starbucks blonde roast would blast me out of any hangover). This means I have to respect and pay attention to what drugs and alcohol are doing to my body.

Lastly, these last 3 weeks have led to progress in areas of my life unrelated to caffeine. For example, I have been complaining to friends/family about my job for years and silently planning to leave (before backing off and shelving that plan for a few months until the cycle begins again), but just over a week ago I decided to actually start conversations with people who might consider hiring me, leading to one person offering me a promising job on the spot. Have I been stuck in a caffeine-induced cycle of complacency and stasis for years, where I satisfy myself with daily dopamine from coffee when I should be producing it organically from taking risks and achieving things? It's hard not to notice the coincidental timing at play.

I don't really know what to make of all these improvements put together... this is really not what I was expecting. I thought that cutting down caffeine would lead to some specific improvements in energy and irritability, but it seems like caffeine abuse impacts mental/physical/emotional systems in more subtle but global ways than I had appreciated.",3,1767098976.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

It was a story-driven game about a mysterious café or dessert shop that only appears when someone truly needs it. I remember a sad person (maybe)  walking through snow, possibly at night, who encounters the shop and receives a coupon or receipt with its name, but when they return the next day, the shop is gone. Later, it appears again, usually at night. The shop lets you order drinks or desserts with strange names, and those items are named after previous customers who went through the same experience of regret with the character. The shop allows you to go back to the past to relive moments you regret, but there’s a strict time limit (before the drink gets cold or the last drop runs out). When time is up, you must choose between staying in the past and being forgotten or returning to the present and accepting reality. The ending and dessert you receive depend on your choices, and I specifically remember getting a rainbow cake in the ending for the path I chose. The game felt very emotional and melancholic, and it seemed inspired by Before the Coffee Gets Cold. I don’t think it was a mainstream game—I may have found it through phone recommendations in my vivo app rather than the Play Store. It has a cute drawing style.

1pzh7xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunglasses/comments/1pzh7xd/tips_for_identifying_raybans_or_determining_their/,Tips for Identifying Ray-Bans or Determining Their Authenticity,"Thinking about posting here to identify a mystery pair of Ray-Bans? Or posting here to determine if a particular pair of Ray-Bans is authentic or fake? Please consider the following before posting:

**Identifying Mystery Ray-Bans**

Before asking for help identifying a pair of glasses, use Google Lens to try to identify them yourself.

1. In Chrome, right-click on the photo or other image of the glasses.
2. Select ""Search with Google Lens.""
3. Drag the crop handles to surround the glasses and make it the focus of the search. Otherwise, Google Lens is likely to tell you ""This is a picture of sunglasses on some wanker's face"" or ""This is a photo of sunglasses lying on a coffee table littered with empty beer cans, cigarette butts, and what appears to be a bong.""

**NOTE:** Google Lens--and the AI driving it--is sometimes as dumb as a bag of hair. It is frequently wrong. If it tells you that the Ray-Bans are Oakley sunglasses, try adding Ray-Ban and other keywords to the search by posting a follow-up question. Google Lens may continue to insist that the glasses are Oakleys. If so, tell Google Lens to sod off.

Post as much information as possible about the mystery glasses. If you're attempting to ID a pair of glasses, where did you see them? In what context? For instance, did you see a celebrity wearing them in a photo in *People* magazine? Knowing the celebrity's name and where the photo appeared may help others to identify the glasses. (Also, stop reading *People*; it's mindless dreck.)

**Real or Fake? Authenticating Ray-Bans**

If you're trying to authenticate a pair of Ray-Bans, tell us as much as possible about them. Consider answer the following questions and others like them:

* Where did you get them?
* How much did you pay?
* Are they for sale? Where? For how much? Do you really think that you can buy a brand-new pair of Aviators online for $29.99? If so, did you know that if you hold a banana to your ear you'll hear the word ""gullible""?

Perhaps most important, post as many of the following photos as you can:

* straight-on view
* view from the rear with the temples extended
* close-up shots of the hinges (very important)
* side view showing any logos and embellishments and showing, as well, the angle formed by the lens and the temples (called the ""panoptic tilt""). Counterfeiters often neglect this feature when making fake Ray-Bans, especially fake Wayfarer Classics, which have a pronounced tilt of about 7 degrees. Note that New Wayfarers RB2132 don't have the tilt, nor do RB2140F, which is the Asian Fit version of the Classic.
* clear, legible shots of the inside of each temple, showing all of the writing found there. With vintage B&L glasses, look for and photograph any impressions on the ear pieces (for example, *W1596 YUAS*\--the model code for B&L Traditionals Style 4).
* shots of the impressions on the top or bottom of the bridge
* clear shot of the Ray-Ban logo on the right lens (or the absence of the logo)
* clear shot of the RB or BL logo etched into one or both lenses. Capturing the logo can be difficult. Try placing a black piece of paper behind it, or positioning the glasses so that a light illuminates the logo itself or the area around it.
* shots of the front, back, and inside of the case, clearly showing in detail the stitching and the snap closure (or other closure). The stitching should be tight and consistently spaced. The logo on the snap closure should be slanted from 7:00 to 2:00. (I've never seen a pair of genuine RBs with the logo slanted at a different angle.)
* shots of the packaging, including the grey gift box. Fake gift boxes are shiny and smooth; genuine gift boxes are dull and mottled.
* shots of the product box in which the glasses are packed, including a shot of the sticker on the end of the box. Be sure to include a clear shot of the QR code printed on that sticker. Scanning the QR code on the box should give back a 24-character string of alphanumeric characters, used for internal product tracking by Ray-Ban. If it gives back a URL for Ray-Ban or Luxottica, then the box is fake (and probably the glasses, as well). If it gives back nothing, it's not a QR code; it's just squiggly lines, and the box is decidedly fake.
* shots of any product literature accompanying the glasses

That's all the advice I have right now for improving your chances of identifying or authenticating a pair of Ray-Bans. I'll add to this post if I think of other tips, so please save it for later by clicking on the three dots alongside the title of the post.",2,1767098730.0,sunglasses,0,1.0,False
1pzh6s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChinaLiuXueSheng/comments/1pzh6s2/passed_xjtu_interviewacademic_review/,Passed XJTU Interview/Academic Review,"Just wanted to share my Xi'an Jiaotong University academic review & interview experience. I applied for a Chinese-taught Master's Degree course within the School of Humanities and Social Science (人文社会科学学院). 

I received an interview invitation via email on Dec 24 (went into my spam folder).
The email requested us to add the XJTU Postgraduate Teaching Secretary (硕士研究生教学秘书) on WeChat; she set up a group chat with four other School of Humanities and Social Science applicants.
She then sent us a Word document with the XJTU template for a postgraduate study plan/research plan (it didn't really differentiate between Master's and PhD), which we had to send back by Dec 28. It was quite a detailed document, which required us to write a thesis abstract, research questions and a bibliography of 40 to 50 sources. 
We were also encouraged to prepare a short PPT to share during the interview.

The interview was held on Dec 29, with each applicant joining the meeting room one after the other as prompted with live communication by the XJTU Secretary on the WeChat groupchat. We had 5 minutes each to introduce ourselves and explain our research interests.
When I joined, I could see four people sitting at a large meeting table with the School of Humanities and Social Science logo on the wall behind them: one woman who was probably the XJTU Secretary, one assistant who brought coffee/water and two male professors who were the ones who actually asked me questions.

The interview started about 20 minutes late and was conducted entirely in Chinese; they asked me the following questions:

1. Where did you study Chinese?
2. Did you already pass HSK?
3. Tell me about your initial interest in Professor XYZ's academic research (this was someone I mentioned in Bachelor's dissertation summary; this professor's research constituted the foundation of my Bachelor's research and my inspiration for my Master's application).
4. Do you want to do an English or Chinese taught degree?
5. As you want to do a Chinese-taught degree, are you happy/willing to have Chinese coursemates?
6. The final thesis can be written in English or Chinese; what would you prefer ideally?
7. Have you ever been to China? Which cities?
8. Have you ever been to Xi'an?

The following day I could see on the XJTU application portal that I had passed my academic review and entered the ""Pre-admission"" stage.

I've been working on a game about remembering fonts.

Since this place and the game are about identifying fonts, I think this could be the right place to share and get some feedback from people who are into fonts.

\-> [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remember-the-font/id6745820637](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remember-the-font/id6745820637)  
I wanted a game to play during the one-minute wait in line for coffee. Mindlessly crushing candy on my phone felt wrong. I thought if the game wasn't about colored bricks or digital candy, maybe I could learn something AND have fun? So I made this little game about getting to know fonts.

I am not a professional programmer; I create fonts for a living ([https://handwriting.digital](https://handwriting.digital)), and this is a fun side project I've been working on this year.

Could you give it a try and tell me what you think? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas.

The app works on iPhones and Macs - and it's free (for now.)

Enjoy and Happy New Year!

PS.: I am already working on a version of the game that adds a new font to the board after completing a level (33 Fonts in total. All of the fonts are standard Mac System fonts. I thought about adding chapters or packs for different font topics, like Movie Posters, Top 20 16th-century, 1970s serifs, 1980s sans, The Mountains of Google Fonts, The Valley of Adobe Typekit, 90s Grunge, The GitHub Forest, etc.)",10,1767098592.0,identifythisfont,0,1.0,False

1pzh3sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1pzh3sr/finally_feel_like_i_made_a_friend_for_the_first/,"Finally feel like I made a friend for the first time in ages, but now I'm starting to doubt myself...","Just for context, I am 32M and she is 24F. She's probably the friendliest person that I've met in my life and she is extremely outgoing. I started talking to her at work a few weeks ago when I was training her on how to do something and it turns out that we have a lot of things in common. Some of the parallels are downright surprising, even she has commented how similar we are. More context: I have ***zero*** friends besides my girlfriend.

**I'm not interested in dating her as she has a boyfriend of about 1 year and I have a girlfriend of 11 years.** I genuinely just think she's interesting and enjoy yapping with her.

It's kinda funny, but I asked her if she wanted to be friends and potentially hang out outside of work and she was like yes absolutely and thought it was silly that I made it a formal request in person and she hugged me.

It felt great - I made a friend, I made a connection, I finally did something great and overcame major anxiety in the process. My anxiety went away for a few weeks, but now it's back and worse than ever.

After talking with her and working with her more at work, I began to notice that she's friends with nearly everyone. Now my anxiety is asking if I actually did make a connection with her or if she's just default friends with everyone. One of the friends she has is someone that I've always found to be very offputting and makes extremely weird comments and always talks about World War I/II, the fact they worked in a prison, and talks very loudly and draws attention. She's also already friends with people who were just hired a week or two ago. Is it wrong that she's friends with people that I wouldn't be friends with? No, absolutely not. She's absolutely allowed to be friends with other people.

This anxiety started when she texted me and offered to get me some coffee before work. I thought that was a neat offer. I've never accepted someone's offer for them to grab something before work before, so I decided to accept. When she came in, she had coffee for everyone working that morning and not just me (even the new people who had only been there for a few weeks). I wasn't expecting to be upset by something like this, but the fact that she was texting the new hires and also got them something, too, made me feel like I wasn't ""special"" and that maybe I'm not her friend after all and that she's just ""nice""? It's not wrong that she picked up stuff for everyone and it isn't wrong that she did something nice. I'm not upset at her, either. 

So now I'm spiraling because it doesn't feel like I actually accomplished anything. She's just friends with everyone as her default, baseline state. I didn't do anything special and her personality is just open and friendly. Now I'm second guessing everything again like the fact that I always initiate conversations, if she doesn't reply within a couple of hours I begin to feel anxious, if I double text I'm weird and pushy, if I even text her I'm probably bothering her, etc. All of this stuff was not bothering me until this coffee thing happened and I was actually proud of myself for not letting it get to me like it normally would have.

I'm also more of a 1-on-1 talker and I only like to open myself up to specific people, but she likes to chat as a group and invites people over. I'm able to overcome this, but only with a very select group of people. Once someone that I don't resonate with joins the conversation, I just leave because I'm not interested anymore. She also has a boundary of no 1-on-1 outside of work because we're both in relationships which I completely understand. It just sucks because all I want to do is just yap for hours about whatever and it sucks that there's this thing that guys and girls can't be ""just friends."" 

It's all especially stupid given that for the first time in my adult life, I hung out with someone outside of work. She came out and had lunch with my girlfriend and I and then we went to a shopping center together. She even said that she was super excited to be hanging out with us.

I hate myself. I hate that I'm jealous that she talks to everyone. I hate that I only want to be friendly/talkative to certain, specific people. 

I keep telling myself that I should just tell her that I'm sorry if I've bothered her and tell her ""never mind"" about the friendship and just leave her alone. I feel worse with a ""friend"" now than I did with no friends at all. Apparently the solution to this is to just ""make more friends"" but there's not anyone else at work that I really feel like being friends with. I honestly don't want to go through this process again because it is time consuming and exhausting to me.

I used to think gift cards were only for gifting. Now I treat them like “discount coupons you buy once and use slowly” for stuff I’m going to purchase anyway.

If you’re trying to save on everyday spending without doing extreme budgeting gymnastics, gift cards can be a pretty low-effort hack.

# How I actually use them (without turning it into a full-time hobby)

* I pick **only the brands I already use** (no “discount bait”).
* I buy gift cards only when there’s a **reliable discount/cashback** running.
* I keep it boring: groceries, food delivery, coffee, pharmacy, fuel, and the occasional movie.
* I load smaller amounts so I’m not stuck with a huge balance somewhere I stop using.

# The gift cards that genuinely help with everyday savings

These are the categories that consistently feel “worth it” for regular life:

# 1) Groceries & daily essentials

* **BigBasket / Blinkit / Swiggy Instamart / Zepto** This is where I feel the savings most because it’s repeat spending. Even a small % off adds up fast when you’re ordering weekly.

**Tip:** If your household orders groceries 3–4x a month, gift cards can turn into “automatic monthly savings.”

# 2) Food delivery + eating out

* **Swiggy / Zomato**
* **Domino’s / Pizza Hut / Subway / McD (depending on what you use)** If you order in even once a week, it’s an easy win.

**Reality check:** If you’re using food delivery less as a necessity and more as a habit, gift cards can also *enable* overspending. So… keep a monthly cap.

# 3) Fuel (the sneaky budget killer)

* **IndianOil / HP / BPCL (wherever you fill up most)** Fuel is one of those “can’t avoid it” spends, so any discount feels like free money.

# 4) Pharmacy & wellness

* **Apollo / PharmEasy / Tata 1mg** (based on your usual) If you’ve got monthly meds, supplements, or regular orders, this is quietly useful.

# 5) Coffee / quick bites

* **Starbucks / Café Coffee Day** Not life-changing, but if you’re already buying coffee outside, might as well shave off a bit.

# 6) Multipurpose “catch-all” cards

* **Amazon / Flipkart** Not strictly “everyday,” but I treat these like my backup for random household purchases, emergencies, and boring adult stuff.

# Where to buy them (so it doesn’t feel sketchy)

I stick to **known gift card platforms/apps** and bank portals. Personally, I’ve used **GyFTR** (pretty straightforward and discounts are often decent), plus other mainstream apps that run periodic cashback deals.

**Tip:** Don’t buy from random sellers/unknown websites just because the “discount” looks huge. That’s how people get burned.

# Quick mistakes I made so you don’t have to

* Bought a big-value gift card, then didn’t use it for months.
* Picked too many brands and ended up with money scattered everywhere.
* Got tempted by discounts for brands I don’t even use (classic trap).

# My simple setup (if you want to copy it)

* Pick **3–5 brands** you spend on every month.
* Buy gift cards **only when** there’s a discount/cashback.
* Store codes neatly (notes app + email folder).
* Track balances once a month.

If you already do this: what cards are actually working for you lately?  
And if you’re new to it: what’s your biggest monthly pain point right now… groceries, food, fuel, or something else?",1,1767098247.0,u_TechnicalStruggle632,0,1.0,False

1pzgzpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSeed_Health/comments/1pzgzpg/does_red_bull_make_you_infertile_faq_for_men/,Does Red Bull make you infertile? (FAQ for men + couples TTC),"One of the most asked questions we get is: **does redbull make you infertile?** People also ask it as **can redbull make you infertile** or **does red bull make you infertile** — so let’s answer it properly, without fear-mongering.

# Quick answer

**A single Red Bull now and then is very unlikely to make you infertile.**  
If anything matters, it’s usually the *pattern*: high caffeine every day, poor sleep, high stress, lots of sugar, and other lifestyle stuff that quietly drags fertility down.



# FAQ 1: Does redbull make you infertile?

**Not directly in any “one can = infertility” way.**  
There isn’t strong evidence that a normal energy drink habit, by itself, flips a switch and makes you infertile.

What *can* happen is you end up doing things that harm sperm health:

* sleeping less
* running on stress
* eating worse
* gaining weight
* skipping exercise
* relying on stimulants daily

That bundle is the real fertility risk for a lot of men.



# FAQ 2: Can redbull make you infertile if I drink it every day?

This is the version that matters most.

**Can redbull make you infertile?** If you mean *heavy, daily energy drink use for months or years*, it’s not crazy to worry about fertility health. Not because Red Bull is “toxic” on its own, but because daily use often means:

* **too much caffeine** (especially if you also drink coffee / pre-workout)
* **worse sleep quality**
* **higher stress hormones**
* **more sugar intake** (if not sugar-free)

Sleep and stress are huge for testosterone and sperm quality. A lot of guys miss that.



# FAQ 3: Does Red Bull affect sperm count, motility, or morphology?

If you’re asking “**does red bull make you infertile** by wrecking sperm,” the honest answer is:

* **Moderate caffeine** usually doesn’t look like a disaster in real-world studies.
* The evidence gets more mixed when you pile on **high caffeine + poor lifestyle**.

So if your Red Bull is occasional and your sleep is good, it’s probably not the main culprit.



# FAQ 4: What ingredient is the problem?

Most people blame taurine, but for fertility discussions the usual suspects are:

* **Caffeine** (total daily amount, all sources combined)
* **Sugar** (regular version, if you’re drinking it often)
* **The “energy drink lifestyle”** (short sleep, lots of screens, stress, poor diet)

If you’re drinking sugar-free, that removes one issue. It doesn’t fix sleep.



# FAQ 5: How much is “too much” if we’re trying to conceive?

Here’s a simple rule that works for most couples TTC:

* If you need an energy drink **most days**, treat that as a signal.
* If your **sleep is under 7 hours** most nights, fix that first.
* If you’re stacking **Red Bull + coffee + pre-workout**, your total caffeine may be the issue.

If you want, comment what you drink in a day (coffee + Red Bull + pre-workout) and I’ll help you estimate your total caffeine.



# FAQ 6: What should I do if I’m worried about infertility?

If you’re anxious because you keep seeing “does redbull make you infertile” posts, do the practical thing:

* **Cut down for 8–12 weeks** (that covers a sperm production cycle)
* **Protect sleep**
* **Train, but don’t overtrain**
* **Reduce alcohol**
* **Check your semen parameters** if you’ve been trying for a while

A single semen test can end a lot of overthinking.



# Bottom line

If you’re here because you typed **does redbull make you infertile**, the most accurate answer is:

**Occasional Red Bull is unlikely to make you infertile.**  
**Daily Red Bull that wrecks sleep and pushes high caffeine + sugar can contribute to poorer fertility health over time.**",1,1767098033.0,ExSeed_Health,0,1.0,False
1pzgzjt,https://i.redd.it/ap4noutn5cag1.jpeg,Historic Miller's Mill,"Historic Miller's Mill

Over the course of time things change; people and places come and go and the names of places change. If you had described the location of Miller's Mill to someone in the 1820's they would have said, you must mean Moseley's Mill. If you described the same location to someone in the late 1800's and early 1900's they would have said, you must mean Hinton's Mill. Since 1925 it has been known as Miller's Mill. Silas Moseley (1792-1859) and his family were pioneer settlers of Henry County. Silas first appears in Henry County records on August 8, 1822. The Moseley's were experienced farmers and millers and in the wilderness it was easy to see the need for a mill. The falling waters of Cotton River, as Cotton Indian Creek was known at the time, were a perfect site for a water powered mill. The exact starting date of the mill is not recorded. Tradition says the mill dates back to around 1824. We do know that the mill was in place and operating at least as early as 1827 because county records show the first bridge was built at Moseley's Mill in 1827 by Col. James Love.

The original mill was located across the creek from the current mill and did not have a dam; rather, they used a mill race to divert the water falling over the granite shoals. When Silas died in 1859, he left 3300 acres of land and the mill. His Will stipulated that the ""Mill Place"" could not be sold during his widow's lifetime so it could provide for her financially. Nancy Moseley lived until 1888. Following her death, Lon Hinton (1866-1922) purchased the mill from the Moseley estate. Lon Hinton owned the land where this park is located in the late 1800's and early 1900's. While Lon Hinton owned the mill, he built a log dam on top of the shoals to raise the water level and increase the power of the mill and the consistency of water supply. Dave Miller (1844-1966) had a blacksmith shop near the mill and in the early twentieth century helped Lon Hinton build a new mill on the north side of the creek and a concrete dam. With the added water power they were able to add a cotton gin, saw mill, planing mill and electrical generating turbine.

The Hinton family sold the mill and 25 acres to Dave Miller in 1925. Dave Miller had no formal education, but he was a mechanical genius. He designed and built the water wheels and turbines and all the interconnecting belt and pulley systems which powered the mills. In the 1950's, Dave Miller added a large diesel engine to power the cotton gin because water flow was often low in the fall months when cotton needed to be ginned. The entire water powered operation served this community until the race was washed out by the Flood of 1960. Dave Miller's grandson Ray and a team of friends worked on the mill and race in the late 1980's and by 1991 had the opportunity to get the old mill running again to grind some grits and corn meal. The mill burned to the ground on April 14, 2000 and took with it a big part of our history. The saw mill and planing mill have collapsed but the cotton gin is still standing and it holds the distinction of being the last water powered mill still in our county.

We don't know how long a country store has operated at Miller's Mill, however a store was operating when Dave Miller bought the property in 1925 and continued to operate. In 1932, Dave's son David Miller (1910-1990) took over the operation of the store. In 1952, Highway 155 was rerouted and paved and David Miller built a new store building facing the new road. David Miller worked in the mill until it closed and operated the store until he got sick in 1978. When David fell ill, his son Herman came back to Georgia to help keep the store open for a few months; as of 2012 Herman is still running Miller's Store. Commercial activity has been conducted at Miller's Mill continuously since at least 1827, making this the oldest business in Henry County.

Miller's Mill has always played a role in the life of Henry County. This is a place where generations of Henry County farmers ground their wheat and corn, sawed the lumber for their houses and barns, ginned their cotton, had horses shod and things made and mended, and bought groceries and supplies. But Miller's Mill is much more than that, this is where generations of members of Salem Baptist and Ozias Primitive Baptist and other churches were baptized in the cool waters of the mill pond and race, this is where people gathered to seine and grapple for fish and have fish fries and picnics; this is where men sat around a fireplace and burned corn cob fires to keep warm in the old Warming House across from the mill while having their grain ground. Every morning the Miller's Breakfast Club gathers at the store for coffee and conversation. The breakfast club jokes and discusses and solves the world's problems and if they can't find any problems to solve they create some. Miller's Mill is nearly two centuries of what community is all about.

1pzgyad,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1pzgyad/design_this_odd_nook/,Design this odd nook,"Looking for help designing this **odd nook** that’s part of our living room. I’d love to add some type of storage for books, puzzles, board games, and our new old-school home phone for the kids.

The opposite side of the room has a large sectional, coffee table, and our TV, so this nook isn’t meant to be another main seating/TV area. The chairs near the fireplace will be replaced with swivel chairs, and while I’ve tried putting them in this nook, they don’t make sense here since they’re too far from the fireplace (so I’m not looking to move seating into the nook).

We also put our Christmas tree here during the holidays, so whatever we do needs to stay fairly flexible.

I’d love ideas on furniture and how to make this feel intentional instead of like a leftover corner. Space is 84'' x 44''. Pony wall is 44"" high.

Also quickly noting, we're about to have everything replaced with white oak stained a medium brown so all the floors will be consistent. Thanks!

1pzguzm,https://i.redd.it/qdhndghh4cag1.jpeg,People ask me what are master plants,"(Seed used is a winter seed and it’s fall.)

A master plant is a crop you intentionally do not harvest until you absolutely need it. For example, I commented on a post where someone had sold all of their coffee beans but their fish pond demanded 5. A master plant prevents that problem.

The concept is simple: you use garden pots placed indoors—typically in a cellar or a large shed—and plant one crop per pot, ideally covering every regrowable or strategically important crop in the game. Because crops grown indoors ignore seasons, each pot effectively functions as a one-tile greenhouse as long as it remains inside.

These become your master crops. If you accidentally sell all of something essential—like coffee beans—and suddenly need more (for requests, fish ponds, villagers, or crafting), you can return to that master plant, harvest it once, run it through a seed maker, and regenerate your supply. You then plant the new seed in your greenhouse or appropriate space to restart the entire production chain.

This is especially useful when the crop is out of season or unavailable—such as when the Traveling Cart doesn’t have coffee that day. The master plant acts as a permanent insurance policy against resource lockouts.

That, in short, is what a master plant is: a controlled, indoor, season-proof backup crop designed to keep your farm systems alive no matter what mistakes—or bad RNG—happen.",75,1767097622.0,StardewValley,37,0.74,False

we're trying to ship multiple times per day but qa stage is the bottleneck. and nobody trusts the tests anymore because they've cried wolf so many times. when something actually fails everyone assumes it's just another selector issue.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’ve fainted nearly twice when I was a teenager and had an ED. Once was in class after climbing the stairs to the top floor after not eating for a whole day and I felt it coming and put my head between my legs and then had a sandwich and I never actually blacked out. 
Second time was when getting out of a hot shower and immediately drying my hair on the hottest setting. Tried to walk to my bedroom across the hall when I went dizzy and actually sprained my ankle cause I fell down in the hall but again never actually lost consciousness.

I’m very very very scared about fainting, even when I’m just at home. I normally never eat breakfast (bad I know) and work in childcare. I barely drink any water during work, I do 2 coffees and if I have time and am really hungry eat a banana before my lunch break but that’s usually only like once every 2 weeks. 

So I’m not really a fainter I guess. I have terrible terrible panic attacks and almost constant silent hyperventilation. And I’ve never fainted. So idk why I’m so scared. Also getting blood drawn or gory images of videos don’t make me faint so I really don’t know why I’m so sure I’ll just faint at any given moment. 

I have constant bouts of dizzyness and lightheadedness and brain fog. Even when I’m not panicking or anxious. 

I guess I just want to know, people who actually are ‘fainters’. Is it as scary as I imagine and why am I so scared of it? I’m at a point where I sometimes wish I would just faint so I actually know what it’s like and maybe the ‘not knowing part’ would ease a bit?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
