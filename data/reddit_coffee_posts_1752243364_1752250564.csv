1lxatjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextInsurance/comments/1lxatjb/what_is_business_owners_policy_insurance/,What is business owners policy insurance?,"Hey everyone! I've been getting a lot of questions about Business Owner's Policies (BOPs) lately, so figured I'd break it down for you.

A BOP is basically two types of insurance rolled into one package: general liability and commercial property coverage. Think of it as the combo meal of business insurance.

[General liability](https://www.nextinsurance.com/comparison/general-liability-vs-business-owners-policy/) helps cover the stuff that happens when you're dealing with customers and the general public. Like when someone slips and falls at your shop or you accidentally damage a client's property.

[Commercial property](https://www.nextinsurance.com/comparison/business-owners-policy-vs-commercial-property/) insurance helps protect your actual stuff, like equipment, inventory, and even the building (if you own it).

The reason why many people go with a BOP instead of buying these separately is pretty simple, it's cheaper and less of a headache to manage. In some cases, you can get extras thrown in like business interruption coverage (say, if you have to shut down temporarily after a covered event).

A few examples of when a BOP really comes in handy:

* Your coffee shop gets hit by a pipe burst and you have to close for repairs while replacing all your equipment.
* A customer trips over something in your store and wants you to cover their medical bills.
* Vandals break into your workshop and trash everything.

The main thing to know is that BOPs work best for smaller businesses with physical locations or valuable equipment. If you're just doing consulting work from home with a laptop, you probably don't need all this coverage.

If you have any questions about getting this coverage drop 'em below or check out our [BOP insurance](https://www.nextinsurance.com/business-owners-policy/) page!",1,1752249968.0,NextInsurance,0,1.0,False

I am a full time teacher currently but have been applying to ap/ar jobs, or really anything that lends to building an accountant resume. I was offered a job today but im feeling totally torn and looking for advice. Im going to break down my thoughts hoping some outsiders can offer any perspective:

Teaching is 6-2:30. Like im HOME by 2:30 which has been amazing for housework and errands but some days i come home so depleted i cant do anything but lay on the couch. Teaching is incredibly overstimulating and draining. How many times did i cry last year? Lost count. Im worried i will struggle with at wgu because of this, even though ill have the time. I have been wanting out of the classroom for sometime and have been applying to all sorts of jobs for over a year. Dont get me wrong, I pour my heart into my students success, probably why it takes so much out of me. 

For this AR role id have to leave my house around 7 and not get home till nearly 6. Its 30-40 minutes away and with traffic might get up to an hour, 8-5. They say its very busy but also told me its generally easy work once you get the swing of things. I think it will be less draining but the commute scares me. Im thinking i could go to a coffee shop or other space and work on school for an hour before heading home to avoid traffic but then im getting home even later. Im 33, married and it‚Äôs not like when I was young and single and only accountable to myself. 

Pay and benefits is about the same. The real pull is that I‚Äôll be getting accounting adjacent experience. One of the girls in the office told me she was also in school for accounting so clearly it‚Äôs do-able. The company is also awesome, i loved the team and the manager who interviewed me. Theyre a big company but laid back like jeans and sneakers are okay, regular provided lunches etc. but teaching is familiar, i know the job expectations, my team, and i like to think i could do school work on my lunch but i usually need that time to just decompress. 

Im just torn and need some outside perspective. It will be such a change going from home before 3 to home after 6. Or am i being dramatic? How much benefit am I gaining from an AR role before my degree, am I over estimating that? 

Ok this has been much more of a ramble than anticipated. 
Open to any feedback but please be kind. TIA!

1lxamei,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxamei,Janine‚Äôs Tape Mix for Your Listening Pleasure,"Our girl, Janine‚Äôs been through Hell; literal hell, and we as an audience know it. ‚ÄúWill she or won‚Äôt she‚Äù has been the central question throughout the seasons of THT, and it seems like time to find out what possible songs a survivor like Janine would spin in her head.

Throughout the seasons, Madeline Brewer has been a sensational performer as Janine, and it‚Äôs a shame there isn‚Äôt a series with just her in it. Janine alone would be a popular spin-off with the right mix of writers, directors, producers, etc. But the emphasis here is Damn Good Writers, for her character.

Now‚Ä¶Songs!

Madeline Brewer has an excellent singing voice and the producers incorporated her talents throughout the show:

A. ‚ÄúThree Little Birds‚Äù by Bob Marley and The Wailers

B. ‚ÄúI Only Want To Be With You‚Äù by The Bay City Rollers

C. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Up?‚Äù (What‚Äôs Goin‚Äô On) by 4 Non Blondes 

D. ‚ÄúHard Knock Life‚Äù from the soundtrack for the Musical, ‚ÄúAnnie‚Äù but I think Janine would spin the Jay-Z version
Someone here on Reddit mentioned Janine humming ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been Working On The Railroad‚Äù too. 

That‚Äôs what I think, Janine had sang. 

So, what else did she listen, or sing along to?

Here‚Äôs a mixed selection of songs, which you can create yourself on Spotify (if you have it) if you have it. All of these you can easily find on YT, too.

1. ‚ÄúSeeing Red‚Äù by Minor Threat  (a very angry Punk classic. Deep down inside, I‚Äôm sure Janine still has fire.)

2. ‚ÄúVindictive‚Äù by The Slits.  If you look up the Peel Session from 1977, there‚Äôs a good version of this one.

3. ‚ÄúBrand New Key‚Äù by Melanie.  I think this was in another film; maybe a Tarantino film, but I can‚Äôt remember now.

4. ‚ÄúJanine‚Äù by David Bowie.  Janine (Sort of embarrassingly smiling): ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my song!‚Äù

5. ‚ÄúFire and Rain‚Äù by James Taylor. A classic we can all relate to, I think.

6. ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù by Elton John.  Elton did a cool early black and white video of this song. Look it up!

7. ‚ÄúFair Play‚Äù by Van Morrison. The ‚ÄúVeedon Fleece‚Äù classic. It‚Äôs a cool tune.

8. ‚ÄúDown by The River‚Äù by Buddy Miles.  Buddy recorded a long 13 minute jam on this Neil Young-scribed omnibus. It‚Äôs real good.

9. ‚ÄúCriminal‚Äù by Fiona Apple.  Back in the late 90‚Äôs, this one was on heavy FM radio rotation, which is too bad. It fit‚Äôs Janine, though.

10. ‚ÄúA Sorta Fairytale‚Äù by Tori Amos. I feel Janine would own every damn Tori Amos CD, at home and in her car. Any Tori Amos song would fit.

11. ‚ÄúBrass in Pocket‚Äù by The Pretenders. Janine: ‚ÄúYou need a refill? Coffee?‚Äù  No, uh, we‚Äôre good Janine. Just bring us the check

12. ‚ÄúWaitress Song‚Äù by First Aid Kit. They are magnificent songwriters and performers. Tear jerking good.

13. ‚ÄúFlaming Telepaths‚Äù by Espers, and ‚ÄúAstronomy‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult.  Espers cover of this, by BOC. Play them sequentially, like PB and Jam.

14. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù by Jane‚Äôs Addiction.  Janine would definitely spin this.

15. ‚ÄúScar Tissue‚Äù by Red Hot Chili Peppers. She would love these guys too. Even when Hillel Slovak was with them.

16. ‚ÄúEverybody Hurts‚Äù by R.E.M.  Wow, this song‚Ä¶

20. ‚ÄúSuperstition‚Äù (Sesame Street version) by Stevie Wonder. Just find it on YT. It‚Äôs great!

21. ‚ÄúMore Than a Feeling‚Äù by Boston. Janine would be more likely a Classic Rock FM gal, and she‚Äôd know the songs by heart, like this one.

Hey screenwriters of Reddit! 

My 100% human made indie feature film ""BitterSweet"" is now streaming on Amazon Prime.  

The process of going from a blank page to distribution was equal parts exhilarating and brutal. I've been a screenwriter since 1999 when my first indie film ""Smiling Fish & Goat on Fire"" won the Toronto International Film Festival. My second screenplay ""Lymelife"" also won Toronto and premiered at Sundance in 2009.  
Wow has the indie film world changed alot since then. Festivals don't even matter any more, the bar is so high and filled with corporate tech bro ai sponserships they really aren't indie at all.  Next movie I make I will not spend as much on all those film free way submissions.  Save that money for marketing.  

I'd love to talk more about my whole process, from writing in the cafe, to casting the barista who gave me free coffee, to shooting in the 8 differebt locations in the same cafe I wrote in.  

If anyone‚Äôs curious, I can share more about the process or answer questions about writing for production realities. Here‚Äôs the trailer and streaming link if you want to check it out:

1lxaiky,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lxaiky/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_wife_for_losing_her/,AITA for being upset at my wife for losing her ambition,"Please be aware, this is a post of some considerable length. 

First and foremost, as necessary context, I fell in love with my wife partially for her looks and her laugh, but primarily because she is more intelligent and capable. This has created a healthy element of competiton in our marriage but it deeply disorients me when this dynamic is shifted permanently on its head. 

My wife and I, her husband, (30 and 31 respectively) have been together for 10 years, and have been married for 7 years now, having married straight out of university. We have been friends since our childhood, and for additional context, we lived in a deprived area and resolved from an early age to make something of ourselves, unlike our respective siblings and peers who she believed to be doomed to fecklessness (not their fault given our family and our community).

As such, we went off to uni together and were able to secure our dream jobs in the legal profession (at different firms but in much the same role). We moved to the city together (London) and within a few years we enjoyed all the long sought material benefits of success. 

Even by this point, our ambition remained strong. In fact, she was the one who helped me survive a crisis of confidence 4 years ago following our daughter's death. We threw ourselves back into our work while resigning ourselves to that fact that children were no longer a possibility in our future given the medical issues my wife suffered during the pregnancy.

However, in the last 6 months or so, I have felt a change in the relationship as she has grown to be increasingly less committed to her work and, as mentioned in the title, less ambitious. She works fewer hours (our 'official' working hours are not particularly above average, but pursuing advancement does necessitate going above-and-beyond) and no longer enjoys working out together. In fact, our routine which has carefully been built over the past few years has been shattered and she has settled into a more sedate pace, often returning home before 7 P.M and sleeping more. She has also flirted with the idea of re-establishing contact with our families in our 'home' town, despite it originally being her desire to cut off contact.

None of this has been immediately upsetting to me, but the spate of changes have left me disoriented and unsure of our position. 

What further confuses me is her changing views. For instance, she has now come out in favour of therapy and (as an example) against capital punishment, marking a marked change from long standing shared thoughts and views.

This frustration and confusion boiled over last night when I was made officially aware of my promotion at my firm. I returned home after work to find my wife already home and making dinner. At this point I attempted to raise the issue as delicately as possible but she kept attempting to dodge the matter. This forced my hand and I asked my questions bluntly.

I came over all pathetically emotional and essential begged her to explain this change but she wasn't able to offer any real answer. At this point I became angry and accused her of losing her ambition. 

This was partially a provocation, as we both regard our ambition as being second only to our relationship, but she did not rise and simply told me she wasn't sure what was happening.

I asked her if I had impacted her ambition in any way and offered to quit my own work if that would motivate her again but she grew very upset and begged me not to do that. 

At this point, the matter largely de-escalated and I put her to bed after taking a shower. I went out for a smoke to calm down but my frustration hadn't abated by the time I returned and I accidentally broke our shoe rack before sleeping with her. 

She slept in this morning and when I made her coffee she asked me to stay home today, so I used my first sick day in years and not go into work today. We plan on discussing the issue this weekend

1lxad8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lxad8e/find_out_if_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker_by/,Find Out if the Best French Press Coffee Maker by Stanley Delivers,"The Stanley 10-0288800 has become a staple in my daily coffee routine. This French press didn‚Äôt just meet my expectations‚Äîit managed to stand out in a sea of coffee makers with its rugged design and stellar performance. As someone who‚Äôs both a coffee enthusiast and a bit of a klutz (I‚Äôve broken more glass presses than I‚Äôd like to admit), finding a durable, dependable product felt like striking gold. The Stanley press delivers not just in function, but in form.  

**Design and Durability**  
The first thing you notice when unpacking this French press is its hefty, sturdy construction. Made from BPA-free 18/8 stainless steel with a charming Hammertone Green finish, it screams ‚Äúrugged‚Äù in the best way possible. It‚Äôs not just a coffee maker‚Äîit looks like a device adventurers, campers, and clumsy kitchen users can rely on. With double vacuum insulation, this beauty keeps your coffee piping hot for up to four hours (which I can personally vouch for‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect on lazy weekend mornings where I lose track of time).  

**Insulation and Temperature Holding**  
The double vacuum insulation technology isn't just fluff in the description. It genuinely retains heat, keeping your coffee hot for hours. On a particularly long workday, I made a full press of coffee and was amazed to find it still warm by mid-afternoon. For cold brew lovers‚Äîor for the odd person who leaves coffee to cool intentionally‚Äîit boasts the ability to keep cold drinks frosty for up to nine hours. That‚Äôs a real bonus for multi-purpose enthusiasts.  

""Check [STANLEY 10-0288800] deals on Amazon now.""(https://techieupdate.com/p/b07l6lqhb4/)  

**Ease of Use**  
The manual operation may scare off those accustomed to push-button machines, but honestly, there‚Äôs something therapeutic about the process here. Add coffee grounds, pour in the boiling water, wait five minutes, and press the plunger‚Äîsimple and rewarding. I experimented with different grind sizes to see how the mesh filter performed, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The filter was fine enough to leave no stray grounds in my cup while allowing the robust coffee flavor to shine through.  

**Cleaning Made Simple**  
Ease of cleaning makes a world of difference when choosing a coffee maker. While some French presses require complicated disassembly, this product is entirely dishwasher-safe. After a quick rinse, tossing it in with the rest of the dishes was enough. I‚Äôve had finicky presses in the past that required careful handwashing; this was a refreshing change.  

**Benefits**  
- Superior heat retention with double vacuum insulation.  
- Durable stainless steel construction that‚Äôs nearly indestructible.  
- Easy to clean, dishwasher safe.  
- The filter effectively separates coffee grounds for a clean brew.  

**Hurdles**  
- The weight might not suit those looking for lightweight travel options.  
- Manual operation won‚Äôt appeal to buyers seeking push-of-a-button convenience.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to alternatives like the Bodum Chambord or Fellow Clara, the Stanley stays hot longer and feels far more robust. While Bodum‚Äôs glass body looks sleek, I‚Äôve shattered one too many to ignore the Stanley‚Äôs stainless steel advantage. Clara, on the other hand, offers a refined pour, but it comes with a heftier price tag and doesn‚Äôt excel at insulation the way this press does. It‚Äôs the perfect midpoint‚Äîsturdier than Bodum, better insulated than Clara, and reasonably more affordable than high-end options.  

**Value Assessment**  
This French Press strikes an impressive balance between quality and affordability. Compared to pricier brands, its solid build, ability to keep coffee hot for extended periods, and ease of use make it feel like a product worth investing in. Beyond its durability, the flexibility of use (whether you‚Äôre camping or just in your kitchen) adds value to its distinguishing features.

Long story, not AS long, I've had bad acid reflux for several years. I put off finding a fix for it, other than occasionally switching diet (other than caffeine\[coffee\]) to see if that helps. It wrecked my dental health, which thankfully I got fixed last year. Fast forward to today, went to the doctor to get the ball rolling on a few issues, reflux being one, and the nurse practitioner was super concerned about reflux, for obvious reasons, and told me to cut caffeine 100% via weaning so the migraines wont plague me. So, with the health scare in mind, until I know more from a gastroenterologist, I've got to cut caffeine. Coffee is really my biggest crutch, and I can get around that with a little patience and weaning, but my bigger concern is the use or lack there of in a race.

Been dealing with this horrible bug for about 10 years. Didn‚Äôt know for the first 6 that I even had it. I just realized around 2015 to stay away from coffee or whiskey as they both gave me horrible pain. Around 2021 it finally perforated and I had to go to the hospital to get it repaired. They cauterized it and gave me some simple antibiotics and it felt like it was gone. Between 8 months to a year later I felt it creeping back. Would get pain in stomach and pressure in my chest from reflux.  


I was dealing with some other pretty serious health issue and put it to the side. The beginning of this year it was getting worse and I realized I couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore. Finally tested negative with a breath test after quad therapy. That was about 2 weeks ago. 

The issue is that I‚Äôm still having pain with my triggers, mainly coffee. Does it take a long time for the stomach to adjust ? How can I speed it up ? 

I‚Äôm just concerned this may be some false negative. 

And one other thing I wanted to mention, and this may sound strange, but my dreams are more vivid and I‚Äôve been having numbness/tingling in my hands and feet. I can only think that I must have had a b vitamin deficiency all this time from this thing messing with my digestion. The timing is too much of a coincidence. 

If anyone can share their experience/advice it‚Äôd be much appreciated. Thanks.

Honestly I am not a very happy person in general. I stay disappointed with myself quite often. But the last few months have really tested my limits. Placement season going on in my college and I couldn't get a job until the last few months left. Also just to spice it all up, my family went into a spiralling nosedived when feud happened in the very close members who are very dear to me. Now both parties dumped all there frustration on me for months. Hours of conversation and manipulation and emotional blackmailing and trauma dumping some days. I got to know so many problematic things about my very own family that it shook me to the core.
 I have been in a relationship also all the while and in the beginning I used to share but then I stopped it. I just felt it was pointless to vent to her when she had her own problems. My way of handling all this was bottling it all up until I couldn't and then joke about it with a very close friend of mine. Thank you if you are reading this. And no, still latakne nhi ja rha.
 Then I got an offcampus internship. Immediate joining no time to even celebrate, I was sick for twenty days when I interviewed for it. Lost almost 12 kgs in last 10 months. Just when I talked about a ppo, as promised, they told me they didn't need a full timer. Shocked and shook, I felt I had to secure something. i applied in the current job on campus bottled up every distraction and secured it.
 Again when I got the opportunity to loosen the grip and lighten my mood, boom! Met with an accident just the other day. Next job started. I am so drained, even simple chores like brushing my teeth and bathing and eating feels like a task. I remember I stopped it and then got an infection and then sudhar gya. Started bathing and brushing regularly. But meals.. only somedays I take three. Normal days 2 and sometimes it's 1 per day. I was caught sleeping in the very first meeting by mentor sitting right in front of her. Then onwards I keep a cup of coffee for every meeting I attend. She once commented that I can solve complex problems but miss tiny details.. yes maam happens when you're uninterested asf. I have to record my meetings to grasp what was told to do. I have to tell my family that I am normal when they ask me why I have got so thin. And then my sweet sweet gf, she wanted me to make a handmade flower clutcher combo she saw in her reel..  could have made that but then my friend called me and told me he was going through some serious problem and he was getting threats n all so I forgot this. I was planning to take a friends bike and go all the way to her home in the midnight and see her in person because I was missing her so much but guess what???? I forgot the date when she was going outstation. She left today instead of Sunday. And I woke up and saw her story that she already left. She is giving me silent treatment since the past few days.

Not because of grammar or vocabulary, but because of \*thinking\*.   
  
Take ""sobremesa."" Try explaining this to an English speaker: It's that magical time after a meal when families and friends linger at the table, talking, laughing, sharing stories. Not ""dessert time."" Not ""after-dinner conversation."" It's a cultural institution.   
  
When you understand sobremesa, you finally get why Garc√≠a M√°rquez spends three pages describing a family dinner that turns into an all-night storytelling session. Why characters in Allende novels make life-changing decisions over coffee that's gone cold hours ago. It's not just a word - it's how Spanish speakers organize time, relationships, and priorities.   
  
My students who ""get"" sobremesa suddenly start thinking in Spanish, not translating from English. They understand why ""¬øNos vamos ya?"" doesn't mean someone's being rude - they're just checking if the sobremesa is ready to end. This is why literature beats grammar drills. You don't just learn words - you learn worldviews.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it.¬†



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I‚Äôd driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I‚Äôd done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



‚ÄúReally? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.‚Äù



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I‚Äôd paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his ‚Äúpoof‚Äù of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

# ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.¬†¬†



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.¬†¬†



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.

For the longest time, I was that person pulling all-nighters just to get slides looking decent. Sound familiar?

Here's the thing that changed everything: I stopped fighting with PowerPoint and started letting AI do the heavy lifting.

As someone juggling multiple projects, I was skeptical about AI presentation tools at first. But when you're trying to validate three different product ideas while maintaining your day job, you need every efficiency hack you can get.

The breakthrough came when I realized I could dump my messy notes, upload a PDF, or even paste a URL, and get back 20+ professional slides in under a minute. No more wrestling with alignment, color schemes, or trying to make everything look cohesive.

What used to take me 3-4 hours now takes 5 minutes. I'm not exaggerating - I've literally created entire pitch decks during coffee breaks between meetings. The time savings alone have been game-changing, but the consistent professional look across all my presentations has been an unexpected bonus.

For anyone in the side project grind, this shift from manual slide creation to AI-powered automation is huge. It's like having a design team on standby 24/7, which is exactly what we need when we're wearing all the hats.

## Key Features analysis

The beauty and value of quilted maple lies in several key features that differentiate it from standard maple wood.

**Figure Depth:** The depth of the ""quilted"" pattern is crucial. Deeper, more pronounced figures create a more dramatic and visually captivating surface. This depth is often measured by visual inspection and is a primary factor in grading quilted maple.

The depth of the figure gives it its characteristic of motion when viewing it from different angles. In higher grades, this can almost border on holographic. The deeper the figure, the more coveted the piece will be.**Clarity of Figure:** The clarity of the quilt pattern refers to how well-defined and consistent the quilting is across the surface. A clear, consistent pattern is more desirable than a muddled or inconsistent one.

This allows for a better finish and reveals more of the wood's natural beauty. The quilting is the main feature being showcased, so the more clear the better. A clear figure will be free of knots or other imperfections that could deter from the clarity.

**Grain Orientation:** Quilted maple can be found in various grain orientations, including plain sawn, quarter sawn, and rift sawn. The grain orientation affects the stability and appearance of the wood. Quarter sawn quilted maple is frequently enough preferred for its stability and unique ray fleck.

The direction of the grain also changes how the wood accepts stains or finishes, so keep that in mind when selecting a piece of lumber. It will also impact how it reacts to temperature and humidity.

**Size and Thickness:** Quilted maple is available in various sizes and thicknesses, from thin veneer sheets to thick lumber. The appropriate size and thickness will depend on the specific request.

For building guitars, the dimensions will be drastically different than building a table top. Knowing the size that you need before you start is a good way to approach any project. Be sure to add some extra for errors and correction.

**Wood Quality:** The overall quality of the maple wood is essential. Look for pieces that are free from knots, cracks, and other defects. The wood should be properly dried to prevent warping or cracking.

Even the best quilted maple veneer is useless if the wood underneath it is not up to par. This means looking for the straightest grained lumber possible, free of imperfections that could affect its usability.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it.¬†



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I‚Äôd driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I‚Äôd done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



‚ÄúReally? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.‚Äù



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I‚Äôd paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his ‚Äúpoof‚Äù of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

# ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.¬†¬†



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.¬†¬†



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it.¬†



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I‚Äôd driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I‚Äôd done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



‚ÄúReally? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.‚Äù



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I‚Äôd paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his ‚Äúpoof‚Äù of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

# ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.¬†¬†



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.¬†¬†



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.

They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.

The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



‚ÄúReally? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.‚Äù



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I‚Äôd paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his ‚Äúpoof‚Äù of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

# ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.¬†¬†



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.¬†¬†



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.¬†

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it.¬†



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I‚Äôd driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I‚Äôd done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.

Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.

There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.¬†¬†



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.¬†¬†



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it.¬†



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I‚Äôd driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I‚Äôd done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



‚ÄúReally? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.‚Äù



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I‚Äôd paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his ‚Äúpoof‚Äù of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing.

- lots and lots of empty storefronts, and its the same type of stores that are leaving union square: ""destination"" retail that can't compete with e-commerce. They've lost their American Apparel, CB2, Victoria's Secret, North Face, Columbia, Fluevog, and much more. Just like in SF, there's a bunch of local businesses moving in, but it'll be years before all the space is filled. Luxury retail in the suburbs seems to be doing fine, though.

- more tents and homeless people on the street than 10 years ago, with open-air opioid use in the evenings. Not as bad as 16th and mission, but much, much worse than before. It's almost like the drug pandemic isn't localized to our city.

- Rent-a-cops everywhere, actual cops are nowhere to be seen. Locals complains about lack of traffic enforcement. Two walgreens have closed recently, and the closest one locks up its toothpaste and only has one person on staff.

- the central mall in uptown, Calhoun Square, is almost completely empty. It's been a community staple since the 80's -- Prince even wrote a song about it! Now all that's left is a gym and a Chase bank. I'm currently working out of a coffee ""shop"" that's just a pop up in the middle of the first floor.

- Sounds of fireworks and street racing in the evening. Kids on summer vacation enjoy committing minor crimes everywhere.

That said, the city is as vibrant as ever:

- The beaches, parks, and libraries are beautifully maintained, and are filled with families day and night. The best part of visiting here is walking down to the lake in the evenings and taking in the scene. Every year I come out, there's more people on bikes.

- There's been a nightlife renaissance post-COVID, and lots more local comedy and music on small stages than I ever remember.

- The somali immigrant population seems to have taken root, and rejuvenated the exceedingly bland local food seen. Glad to see millennial breweries replaced with the smell of injeero and goat meat.",37,1752248039.0,sanfrancisco,8,0.89,False

# Chapter 16: Year Zero

The moment Kazuya stepped out of Naha Airport, the air hit him like a wave‚Äîheavy, humid, and scented with salt and something floral he couldn‚Äôt name. It clung to his skin, soaked into his shirt, and wrapped around him like a foreign presence.

This wasn‚Äôt Tokyo.

He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, lungs filling with the newness of it all. The tang of sea breeze. The faint traces of coconut sunscreen from the crowd. The lazy buzz of cicadas hidden in the trees beyond the parking lot.

This was it.

Day one.

Year zero.

He adjusted the straps of his backpack and stepped into the sun. Two suitcases rattled behind him, the cheap plastic wheels scraping audibly against the concrete. A part of him had expected more fanfare. Some sign. A marker in time. But all he had was this breath‚Äîand the sweat already beginning to bead on his brow.

It was enough.

Kazuya followed the signs toward the bus terminal, scanning for the route to the University of the Ryukyus. The voices around him were softer than Tokyo‚Äôs, less clipped, more fluid. Like the island itself resisted urgency.

That suited him just fine.

He turned the corner and was greeted by a different kind of noise. Laughter. Male voices. Boisterous and performative.

‚ÄúDude, let me help! No, seriously, I lift weights, I got this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkinawan hospitality! I insist!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, let me at least carry your bag to the curb!‚Äù

Kazuya slowed.

A crowd of young men had formed near one of the shelters. They weren‚Äôt blocking the way, but their energy was invasive. Loud. Eager. They orbited someone, but he couldn‚Äôt yet see who.

Then he did.

She stood tall, poised with a quiet, regal confidence. Around twenty, strikingly elegant, and completely unfazed by the surrounding clamor. Her snow-white hair was tied into a low braid that draped over her left shoulder, with soft bangs framing a porcelain face that belonged on an oil painting. Ice-blue eyes‚Äîsharp, intelligent, emotionally distant‚Äîswept over the scene with a calm detachment that bordered on indifference, yet beneath that chill was the faintest flicker of something heavier. Sadness, maybe.

She wore a simple cotton shirt tucked neatly into olive trousers, the sleeves rolled up to her forearms. Minimalist. Practical. Purposeful. Her navy-blue suitcase, large and battered from travel, wobbled awkwardly behind her with a jammed wheel.

She pulled it with her left hand, adjusted her glasses with her right, and deflected the advances with clipped, formal Japanese. Calm, composed, but visibly annoyed.

A guy reached for the suitcase handle. She sidestepped like it was muscle memory.

Behind Kazuya, a group of girls murmured.

‚ÄúOh my god, she‚Äôs like a model.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt even look real.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at those cheekbones... Is she a celebrity or something?‚Äù

Kazuya sighed.

It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt notice. She was beautiful‚Äîstunning, really. But all of this? The chorus of gawking, the competitive friendliness, the way kindness became a performance? It was exhausting.

He just wanted to sit down.

Not everything had to orbit beauty. Not every gesture had to mean something. Sometimes help was just help.

He gripped the handles of his suitcase and walked straight through the crowd.

No dramatics. No eye contact. Just a quiet bypass.

Because it didn‚Äôt involve him.

A few guys gave him a look. One of the girls raised her eyebrows. The woman glanced up, eyes brushing past him, something flickering‚Äîbut unreadable.

And then he was through.

He reached the front of the line, dropped his bags with a dull thud, and let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd been holding.

He dug into his backpack and pulled out his headphones. The familiar opening chords of ‚ÄúWelcome to the Black Parade‚Äù by My Chemical Romance filled his ears. Loud enough to drown out the world, quiet enough to stay inside his head.

*‚ÄúWhen I was a young boy, my father took me into the city‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Kazuya closed his eyes.

It used to be ridiculous. Overwrought. A melodramatic anthem for kids who needed something to scream into the void. But now, it hit different. Now, it felt earned.

There was no parade. No father leading the way. Just him‚Äîtired, worn, still here.

*‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòSon, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?‚Äô‚Äù*

Kazuya wasn‚Äôt sure if he was any of those. Maybe all. But the line didn‚Äôt ask him to be healed. It just asked him to show up.

And he had.

He let the rhythm cradle him, the distorted guitars and mournful melody washing away the noise of the terminal.

The woman. The crowd. The chatter.

Gone.

He had escaped.

And then‚Äî

a tap.

A light touch on his shoulder, just enough to pull him back.

He opened his eyes.

Someone was standing over him.

And she wasn‚Äôt part of the noise anymore.

# Chapter 17: The Suitcase

From the moment the woman with the white braid stepped into the bus terminal, she had already calculated the odds. She had just landed. Her dorm keys were still in Germany. Her backup set was with the Housing Office‚Äîwhich would be closed for another three hours. She did not want to be driven. Attention invited questions. Questions risked discovery. The bus was the best option.

Unfortunately, she had underestimated the attention a foreign woman with a large suitcase and snow-white hair would attract.

Her grip on the luggage handle tightened. The wheel snagged again. Her braid shifted with her every tug. A soft clatter. Another pause. She adjusted her glasses.

The voices came like gnats.

""Need help, miss?"" ""Let me carry that for you."" ""Wow, where are you from? Germany? Sweden? You look European.""

She offered tight, polite refusals.

""I‚Äôm fine, thank you."" ""No, I insist‚Äî"" ""Please, I said I can manage.""

Her tone was formal, her words neutral. Not a trace of warmth. Not out of malice‚Äîbut strategy. Attention, when unmanaged, became noise. And right now, she needed quiet.

She sensed them circling. Watching. Waiting to pounce with another line. They never read the signals.

Then she noticed him.

Not because he approached‚Äîbut because he didn‚Äôt.

A boy‚Äîyoung man‚Äîslipped through the noise like mist. Black hair tousled, face drawn from fatigue. No swagger. No attention-seeking. Just movement. Straight line. Bags in tow.

He didn't look at her.

Didn‚Äôt even glance.

He walked straight past the crowd, toward the empty bench under the route sign, and sat like the world had no stake in his existence.

*Curious,* she thought.

She watched from the corner of her eye. The others noticed him too‚Äîbut only enough to register his disinterest.

He pulled out headphones. Put them on. Leaned back.

She caught a faint hum of distorted guitar riffs. Something familiar. *Black Parade.*

*Of course.*

She didn‚Äôt know why that detail struck her, but it did. A boy who listened to grief anthems while zoning out public chaos. She liked it. It was... data.

She resumed tugging her suitcase. The wheel resisted again. Her patience was thinning. She wanted no help‚Äîbut also wanted to stop being watched.

And yet he hadn‚Äôt watched.

Not really.

She took a breath and made a decision. One she rarely made. One that chipped at her carefully designed barrier.

She approached him.

Tapped him once.

The boy flinched slightly, startled, and looked up with wide eyes. Behind them‚Äîexhaustion. And something else. Vulnerability.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said in clear, accented Japanese. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to bother you. But‚Ä¶ the suitcase. The wheel is stuck. Would you mind helping me lift it onto the bus?‚Äù

His response was immediate.

‚ÄúOh! Yeah, of course!‚Äù

No hesitation. No calculation. Just motion. He grabbed the handle, heaved it upward, and lodged it into the luggage rack.

‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù he said, stepping back.

‚ÄúDanke sch√∂n,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou are a lifesaver.‚Äù

He offered a tired smile. Nodded. Then walked away.

No follow-up question. No introduction. No request for her name. No lingering glance.

That caught her off-guard more than anything else.

She found a seat across the aisle. Pulled out a small notepad from her bag. Her fingers hesitated above the page.

Then she wrote:

*Subject: Unidentified Japanese male. Age: early 20s. Physiology: average build, dark circles beneath the eyes. Mental state: fatigued. Displays no performative behavior. Reflexively helpful. Did not attempt conversation post-assistance.*

She paused.

*Observation: Unusually disengaged from external stimuli. Uninterested in me. Statistically improbable. Possible emotional detachment due to prior psychological strain?*

She tapped her pen against the paper.

He was‚Ä¶ quiet. But not hollow.

More like someone who had burned out and was still smoldering underneath.

She glanced at him again.

He had fallen asleep. Head tilted toward the bus window. Music still playing.

His expression was peaceful now. Less weighed down. And with that softness, she saw something else beneath the exhaustion: symmetry. A strong jawline, softened by slackened muscles. Gentle cheekbones. A kind mouth.

*He would be handsome,* she thought, *if he just rested more.*

She didn‚Äôt know what compelled her‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt look away.

She watched. And for the first time in a long time, she wondered not how someone could serve her research, but what their story was.

And why she wanted to know it.

She wasn‚Äôt the only one watching anymore.

A few rows ahead, a girl nudged her friend. ‚ÄúShe was looking at him,‚Äù she whispered, barely above the hum of the bus.

She heard it. Felt the shift in attention like a ripple in water. Her face didn‚Äôt move, but her eyes slowly turned toward the window. Not abruptly‚Äîjust enough to feign absent-mindedness.

Her posture remained elegant. Unbothered. But inwardly, something fluttered. Not embarrassment. Not even annoyance.

Just the awareness of being noticed in a moment she hadn‚Äôt meant to share.

Her eyes drifted out the window as the bus began to pull away. The sun flared across the glass, bathing the cabin in amber light. She looked back at him once more. There was something strangely comforting about his stillness. She couldn‚Äôt name it.

Maybe she didn‚Äôt need to.

She tucked the notebook into her bag and leaned back, letting her own eyes flutter shut‚Äînot in sleep, but in something adjacent.

For once, her mind wasn‚Äôt organizing. It was simply... present.

# Chapter 18: The Dorm Threshold

The bus hissed to a stop at the base of the university hill.

Kazuya stirred, barely registering the movement. His headphones were still on. The final chords of ‚ÄúWelcome to the Black Parade‚Äù hung in the air like smoke. It was already warm‚Äîtoo warm‚Äîand the sun pressed against the glass with lazy insistence.

He blinked. Slow. Unfocused. The world felt unreal, like he was watching someone else‚Äôs day unfold through fogged glass.

People were moving. Grabbing bags. Shuffling off.

He followed.

At some point, he found himself outside. The suitcases trailed behind him. The rhythm of their wheels bumping over pavement gave his steps some kind of direction.

The woman from the bus was there.

She moved with purpose. Calm. Unfazed. Her suitcase had jammed again, its wheel dragging stubbornly.

Kazuya didn‚Äôt think. He just stepped in, lifted the bag by the handle, and kept walking beside her.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù she said.

He nodded, vaguely. Not quite present.

They walked the slope in silence. The hill curved gently upward. Trees swayed. Cicadas buzzed in the canopy above.

He didn‚Äôt look at her. Didn‚Äôt look at anything too long. His mind wasn‚Äôt anchored to where his feet were.

At the dormitory gate, she paused.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a new student?‚Äù

He nodded again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Marine Bio,‚Äù he murmured. The words were barely more than breath.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with the same department. Just returned from an exchange semester.‚Äù

He offered a faint noise of acknowledgment, something between a hum and an ‚Äúoh.‚Äù

She watched him briefly‚Äînoticing how his eyes lingered too long on nothing, how his posture bent inward even while standing. Then she turned to open the door.

They entered the building together. The lobby was cool, dim, and quiet. Kazuya‚Äôs shoulders relaxed slightly. His steps slowed, as if unsure whether to continue.

The student assistant behind the desk looked up. ‚ÄúName?‚Äù

He gave it without thinking. ‚ÄúKinoshita. Kazuya.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo welcome packet yet. You‚Äôll get a temp key.‚Äù

The plastic card passed into his hand. Cool. Tactile. Realer than most things that day.

The assistant then turned. ‚ÄúOh! Bayer-sensei. Didn‚Äôt know you were coming back today.‚Äù

Kazuya blinked. Looked toward the woman. Something registered. A name. A second identity.

She didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúUnplanned,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúNot officially on the schedule.‚Äù

She signed a form. Kazuya saw the initials: E. Bayer.

He didn‚Äôt ask.

They walked the stairwell together. The air thickened as they climbed.

At the landing, she gestured loosely. ‚ÄúLaundry‚Äôs behind the kitchen. Wi-Fi is slow after midnight. Don‚Äôt drink the tap water.‚Äù

Kazuya‚Äôs response was a blank, half-aware ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt process most of it.

She rolled her suitcase down the hall. He remained behind, barely aware he had stopped.

She turned halfway. Her voice reached back to him.

‚ÄúElsa.‚Äù

And then she was gone.

Kazuya stood alone in the hallway. The keycard dangled in his fingers.

He scratched the back of his head, as if trying to wake himself up from the inside.

He hadn‚Äôt meant to ignore her. He just‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt here yet.

**Cut to her room.**

She set the suitcase down and let silence fill the space.

From the window, she could see part of the path. The boy‚Äîstill standing.

He hadn‚Äôt moved.

She watched for a moment longer than she intended. Her hand hovered at the curtain‚Äôs edge.

Noticed the subtle slump of his shoulders. The way he turned the keycard over in his fingers like he wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with it.

She let the curtain drop.

Back on the bed, her notebook lay open.

Subject: Unidentified Japanese male. Observation #2. Displays detached affect. Performs social tasks on autopilot. Minimal self-assertion.

She paused.

Did not initiate small talk. Did not ask questions. Accepted role of assistant without prompting.

She tapped the pen.

Reaction to ""Bayer-sensei"": registered but unrevealing. Name: Unknown to him. Elsa offered.

Then, in slightly smaller print:

Emotional orientation unclear. Possible dissociation. Hands showed minor tremor while receiving keycard. Unaware he was being observed. Genuine.

She tapped the pen against her knee. A rare moment of fidgeting.

This variable is‚Ä¶ less predictable than expected.

She closed the notebook more slowly than usual.

Then sat still.

Not planning. Not thinking.

*You‚Äôre not here to be noticed.*

*You‚Äôre here to stay invisible. To finish your work. To disappear on your own terms.*

*So why are you watching a boy who won‚Äôt even look back?*

*He‚Äôs just tired. So are you. That doesn‚Äôt make him significant.*

*You‚Äôre not curious. You‚Äôre just projecting. Stop it.*

*Stop it.*

And yet‚Ä¶

She didn‚Äôt move for a long time.

Simply sharing the quiet.

# Chapter 19: Shoreline Fractures

The room was still.

Too still.

Kazuya lay on his back in the narrow dorm bed, his arms spread wide like he was waiting to be crucified by the silence. The cheap fluorescent light above his head buzzed faintly, a metronome to his insomnia. He didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt twitch. Just stared at the blank ceiling.

*Why can‚Äôt I just shut it off?*

He blinked once. Twice. Still here. Still breathing. That was the problem. Breathing meant feeling. Feeling meant remembering.

He sat up.

His hands were cold despite the warm night. He didn‚Äôt bother with the light. The room didn‚Äôt deserve it. Quietly, mechanically, he pulled on a hoodie, slipped a sachet of instant coffee into his pocket, and stepped out into the hallway.

No one saw him leave.

The sky had bruised into deep violet by the time he found the shoreline.

He didn‚Äôt know where his feet were taking him until the crunch of gravel softened into sand. Until he smelled the salt and heard the faint, rhythmic hush of the tide.

Okinawa‚Äôs coast stretched wide and empty before him. A few driftwood logs lay scattered along the shore. The moon painted the waves in broken silver.

Kazuya sat down on a large rock. Pulled out his thermos. The coffee sachet. Stirred in silence.

The mug steamed in his hands.

For a while, he just sipped. Let the bitterness coat his tongue.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúStupid,‚Äù he muttered.

No one answered.

He looked at the ocean, then down at the sand.

Then back up at the nothing.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you even doing?‚Äù he said, louder this time. ‚ÄúSeriously, what‚Äôs the plan, huh?‚Äù

His voice cracked at the edges, like it was testing itself against the wind.

‚ÄúCome here, start fresh, wipe the slate clean?‚Äù he barked a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúThere is no clean slate, you idiot.‚Äù

*You think miles erase mistakes? You think being alone makes you someone new?*

He stood.

The cup slipped from his hand and landed in the sand. He didn‚Äôt notice.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not healed,‚Äù he said through his teeth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not brave. You‚Äôre just far.‚Äù

He gripped his hair, fists clenching at the roots.

‚ÄúYou left everyone. Everything. Because you couldn‚Äôt face what came next. You don‚Äôt fix yourself by running away, Kazuya. You just hide better.‚Äù

His knees buckled. He didn‚Äôt fall. Just staggered.

Then the tears came.

He didn‚Äôt sob‚Äînot at first. Just cried in silence, like the sea was drawing the pain from his chest with every pull of the tide. It hurt. It physically hurt.

Then‚Äî

A scream.

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù

Birds took off from the trees nearby. The water didn‚Äôt flinch.

He dropped to his knees, sobbing now. Gut-deep. Ugly. His fingers scraped the sand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so‚Ä¶ tired of pretending I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù

His voice broke again.

‚ÄúI miss her‚Ä¶ I miss me‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore.‚Äù

He curled into himself. Pressed his forehead to his knees. Shook.

Then came the last words, barely audible, as if he had to force them out from the very center of his broken chest:

‚ÄúThis is the last time I‚Äôll do this. The last time I‚Äôll cry about this. Tomorrow‚Ä¶ tomorrow I will get up. I will try. I will try to smile. Even if it‚Äôs fake. Even if it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôll try.‚Äù

From the shadows, Elsa watched.

She had come to the beach for peace. Her journal was in her bag, unwritten. She hadn‚Äôt expected to find anyone here. Least of all him.

She had spotted him from the hill, drawn by the strange stillness of his silhouette. By the way he stood too still, like someone clinging to the edge of something unseen.

She had crouched behind the low retaining wall near the shore and stayed hidden.

And now‚Äî

She heard every word.

Every break.

Every sob.

Her grip on the journal tightened.

*Don‚Äôt get involved. He doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre here. He doesn‚Äôt need you. This is his to process.*

But the ache in his voice‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt performative. It wasn‚Äôt self-indulgent. It was *real.*

Raw and shattering.

He wasn‚Äôt loud because he wanted to be heard.

He was loud because there was no one to hear him.

*You know that sound,* she thought. *You‚Äôve made it, haven‚Äôt you? Not out loud, but inside.*

She leaned back against the stone wall. Her braid slid off her shoulder.

*What are you doing, Elsa? This is not your role.*

And yet‚Äî

She couldn‚Äôt leave.

He wasn‚Äôt just some boy. Not anymore. He was a mirror, cracked and dangerous.

And for the first time in a long while, she saw her own reflection.

Kazuya sat in silence. His tears had dried, but the salt still stung.

The tide crept closer. His fingers dug absently into the sand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here,‚Äù he whispered. A confession. A question. A vow.

From the shadows, Elsa finally stood. She adjusted the strap of her bag. Her fingers hovered at her chest.

Then slowly, quietly, she turned away.

Leaving behind footprints that faded almost instantly.

# Chapter 20: The Bell and the Braid

The alarm didn‚Äôt go off. Or maybe it did and he just didn‚Äôt hear it.

Kazuya‚Äôs eyes opened to pale sunlight stretching across the floor. He blinked twice, heart slow, thoughts disjointed‚Äîthen saw the time.

8:33 AM.

Panic shot through his body like cold water.

‚ÄúShit‚Äî!‚Äù

He stumbled out of bed, sheets tangled around one ankle. The room was a blur of mismatched clothes and half-zipped bags. His toothbrush clattered into the sink. Cold water. No towel. No care.

His face in the mirror looked haunted. Red-rimmed eyes. A faint mark from where he must‚Äôve curled too tightly into the pillow. He splashed water on his face as if it could scrub off the night.

Last night.

That ocean. That scream. That‚Ä¶ breaking.

*No. Not now.*

He yanked a T-shirt over his head and jammed his arms through the hoodie from the night before. One shoe on, then the other. Bag over shoulder. Door open.

Thirty minutes shrunk into seven.

He nearly collided with someone at the stairwell landing.

A figure turned smoothly to the side, as if expecting his disarray.

‚ÄúYou have ten minutes,‚Äù she said, voice even, crisp. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your first subject?‚Äù

The braid over her shoulder shimmered faintly in the morning light. Her blouse was tucked cleanly into tailored black slacks. Not a wrinkle in sight.

Kazuya froze.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt actually know.‚Äù

She blinked once. Pulled out her phone.

‚ÄúName?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Kinoshita. Kazuya.‚Äù

She nodded and began speaking rapidly into the phone, switching between polite Japanese and clipped administrative terms. Then: ‚ÄúCome. You're with me.‚Äù

He followed.

The walk across campus was short. Every step, though, stretched like string pulled tight.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from Okinawa, right?‚Äù she asked without turning her head.

‚ÄúTokyo,‚Äù he said, too quickly. Then, slower: ‚ÄúTransferred.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you have breakfast?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶No.‚Äù

A pause.

‚ÄúI have an energy bar if you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Thanks.‚Äù

The silence wasn‚Äôt heavy, just‚Ä¶ complicated.

He didn‚Äôt feel awkward because of her beauty‚Äîthough she was beautiful. It wasn‚Äôt that. It was because he was trying. Really trying. But something inside him still felt fractured.

*Come on. Just hold a conversation like a normal person.*

But the words stayed stuck behind his teeth. He could answer, but not connect. Not yet.

She glanced sideways at him. Didn‚Äôt press.

*He‚Äôs functioning, but not anchored,* she thought. *Still lost in whatever storm he hasn‚Äôt named yet.*

They reached the classroom.

She straightened her sleeves, adjusted her collar, and pushed the door open.

The room quieted instantly.

‚ÄúGood morning, Bayer-sensei,‚Äù the students said in near-unison.

Kazuya‚Äôs steps slowed.

*Bayer-sensei?*

She walked to the front. Turned to face the class. Then motioned toward him.

‚ÄúThis is Kazuya Kinoshita. He‚Äôll be joining our program starting today.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt smile. Didn‚Äôt add fluff.

‚ÄúPlease treat him with kindness.‚Äù

The class murmured various greetings‚Äîsome sincere, some just out of habit.

Kazuya bowed slightly.

As he moved to sit down, a whisper reached his ears from the back corner.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the guy who helped her with the suitcase at the bus stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, the one she actually *talked* to.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was looking at him. Like, really looking.‚Äù

Before the giggles could spread, Bayer-sensei‚Äôs chalk paused midair.

She turned her head‚Äîslowly.

Her eyes, flat and cold, swept toward the source.

Silence.

The students instantly looked down. A shuffle of papers. A throat cleared. The gossip dissolved like vapor.

But it didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. Especially by the guys.

A few of them exchanged looks. One rolled his eyes. Another muttered under his breath.

‚ÄúSeriously? First day and he‚Äôs already in her orbit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt even do anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be nice to get special treatment.‚Äù

Kazuya took his seat, pulse low but awareness sharp.

*What was that?* he thought. *No. Don‚Äôt get drawn in. You‚Äôre here to study. Just... study.*

He exhaled slowly. Kept his gaze forward.

But somewhere beneath the fatigue, something had shifted.

He wasn‚Äôt invisible anymore.

I took art classes and it was common to do ‚Äúartist‚Äôs studies.‚Äù

For artist‚Äôs studies, an artist copies a master‚Äôs work, or a portion of it, to learn how it was done. It is practice, not meant to be finished or original (unlike parody or pastiche), but to understand technique.

I decided to take my experience with artist‚Äôs studies into writing. Pick a simple prompt, like ‚Äúdescribe making coffee,‚Äù and try it as if Hemingway wrote it, or Virginia Woolf, or Tolkien. The goal is not to publish this piece. It is to train your ear and hand for how voice works. You learn so much about syntax, diction, rhythm, and how writers create feeling, sentence by sentence.

I have found this especially helpful when you love a certain style. For example, I adore William Faulkner‚Äôs haunting, poetic stream of consciousness. I like taking a prompt and blending his style into more contemporary ideas outside of southern gothic that are more accessible for readers today.

1lx9yrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1lx9yrz/catholic_relationship_advice/,Catholic relationship advice,"Hello, this is probably not something for this forum but I wanted to get the Catholic opinion on this. So long story short I am in a relationship with a girl who has a kid with somebody else. It was an abusive and narcissistic relationship everything from physical to mental, and sexual. He had been found guilty of all these charges but to skip to the point he has now been granted 50/50 custody essentially.

My girlfriend and I had talked before and I told her if the day came where he got custody and they had to deal with each other that I did not feel comfortable with them being friends, to keep it professional and talk about things that involved the baby.

This week much to my surprise and finding out only by another friend of hers, she met him to exchange the baby (this was previously done with the grandparents) and they talked for a while and decided to get along for the sake of the baby. Today she told me last minute she had a coffee date with his mother at the place where he lives, something we had also discussed that if that happened I would have to be there with her. But logically so, him and his family are uncomfortable with me being there 

I believe as a Catholic that even someone who is a narcissist can change with Christ and she believes he has but I find myself struggling with this because it seems that she is making all these decisions by herself and taking into account everyone's feelings except mine. She has completely gone backwards on what we had agreed on if this day ever came for shared custody. She is a very forgiving person and I don't doubt that she will in the future be open to being friends with him.

Part of me wants to think that this is the best for the baby and that I am giving into my insecurity and fear but part of me feels that even if he is the baby's biological father that I have been the one that filled that fatherhood role and at the end of the day he is still her ex and that I deserve some respect or acknowledgement of how I feel about the situation. 

I'm not sure what to feel, what is right or wrong. I obviously didn't get into detail of everthing and I've tried to keep it short. I ask for your prayers that God may give me wisdom and would appreciate all of your thoughts on this.",1,1752247995.0,Catholicism,5,0.67,False

Freya used the hand that was coated in sick, slick reaper fluid to make a painless psionic incision across his back like a surgeon with a scalpel. She carefully maneuvered around his sternum with minimum bone breakage or tissue tearage with her long, skinny fingers like five antennae probing and prodding her abductee. Once the black viscous venom reached his heart, he was a goner. His blood would slowly spread the painful poison throughout his body until he had become a reasonless, rabid creature that lashed out at everything. A Looper, who was trapped in his own body and in an endless cycle of mindless aggression followed by pitiful bouts of clarity. The only salvation he could hope for was to be put out of his misery by something or someone before he put them out of their misery with malice in his heart. It was dark. It was stark. A brutal reminder that there were fates in this cruel world that were worse than death.

The purple skin on Freya #1‚Äôs face simmered as the Reaper virus began to spread. She clasped her chest with her secondary pair of hands and coughed. This was it. After one last thrust, her duplicate would reach his heart and there would be no turning back. But then... *right there at that moment...* Right when her duplicate was a split second away from damaging his core. A voice reached out like a hand from the grave*.* It whispered to her soul to avoid startling her since her fingertips were a hair away from his heart. All it would take was one fearful shiver to cause infection.

***‚ÄúLet there be Darkness‚Ä¶‚Äù***

Freya‚Äôs eyes scrambled around in her head like two broken eggs. She recognized the voice almost immediately and refused to look down. Something far worse than wicked had just grabbed her attention. It darkened her morning and stole her spine as if she was a carcass. *‚ÄúNo! She‚Äôs going to kill me!!‚Äù* the first thought on her mind was God. The next instinctual cry was for her mother. Her frantic mental babblings were a moment of fidelity to fear and murder. ¬†¬†¬†¬†

A hand reached through the void like a hand from the grave and snatched her by the ankle... *the Lady‚Äôs* touch made her freeze and the hair on the back of her neck stand: *‚ÄúS-she‚Äôs here! No! I‚Äôm going to die!‚Äù* the little voice inside of her skull sliced and diced her brain. She shivered as another scream escaped from her subconscious. There was no place to run. There was no place to hide. She would find her wherever there was darkness.¬†¬†

***‚ÄúStop you‚Äôre whimpering before you infect the child!‚Äù***

Freya gasped at *her* shrieking words. What was once a nice fairy tale had become the place where nightmares came true. Bravery shredded under the blackened claws of this ghoulish creature until there was nothing left but the mangled corpse of cowardice.

*They* let go of her ankle after giving her a fair warning. Something began to rise from the vast whiteness of the temporal void like a wraith rising from its ghostly grave. The very dimensional fabric of space rippled like a pool of tainted holy water as its head came to the surface. The figure rose like a flower... blooming amidst the withered ashes of the faith. It stood behind Freya and remained about as silent and still as a dead man dangling from a noose.

Lady Darkness spread her mothlike wings and let go of the one who was hers to keep after carrying him through time and space like a tomb. Alas, those delicate, intricate, chitinous patterns were as mesmeric as four blinking eyes. With scales that were as hideous as dead butterfly wings. She was the night that chased away the light. The keeper of the bell from above that chimed at *nine.* *Six* when they were hidden far below in eternal darkness.

Freya melted like a warm chocolate bar. She tried to mask her fear, but her shaky knees and hurried breaths gave it away like laughter at a funeral. Her eyes were two dots darting around everywhere but behind her. You saw what she refused to see. The pale scaled woman with black, jagged teeth. The one who laid her head on his shoulder as her black claws sank into his chest like desire and morbidity. The two came together in morbid metamorphosis. She flapped her wings like a bone collector wearing the body parts of dead insects.

When Sensei finally raised his head, the only thing that was left of her were ashes. You could see remnants of what he had not consumed in his black eyes. Dark fragments of what remained from the collapsed dimension he had escaped... *Can you hear her?* *She can see you!* Dark **v**estiges of the rift leeched away at his smooth narrow face like a lich leaving dark entrails that were replaced by in-trails of fresh skin. Bones were made for gnawing and flesh was for chewing. Eschewing a good feast until the one who was protecting him had gotten used to this new place:

*‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that if I were you,‚Äù* he told Freya.

‚ÄúW-who, who are you?‚Äù Freya asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs hungry,‚Äù he said with a mouth full of moths.

***‚ÄúLook away before I devour you next!‚Äù***

‚ÄúW-what was that?!‚Äù¬† Freya asked.

‚ÄúCareful now. Once she gets a taste, she won‚Äôt stop until she gets down to the bone,‚Äù Sensei said rather darkly, warning the girl to tread lightly.

The darkness that painted Sensei black hardened into a chrysalis before exploding into several hundred moths. They fanned out like an infection until all but one had disappeared into the vast whiteness of space. The one moth that remained behind landed atop his head. He took a sip of coffee from his mug without even noticing the inscrutable insect. After taking a few unnerving moments to savor the fresh taste of breakfast blend, he spoke, ‚ÄúLooks like I came just in time. As much as I‚Äôd like to see how this ends, we‚Äôre late for our appointment.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid of him are you?‚Äù Nero gasped.

*‚ÄúQuiet!‚Äù* Freya sneered while tightening her grip.

She took in her surroundings after her mind had finally escaped from the wreckage. The first thing she noticed was that her duplicate was gone. It had been swept aside by Darkness with the ease of a passing breeze. A catastrophe that made it difficult but not impossible to kill Nero. She couldn‚Äôt just summon a new one. It took a tremendous amount of energy and a time-consuming ritual to do so. There was only one option left. She would have to go post-physical.

The veins on the purple parts of her body tightened as she strained to control the spread of the Reaper mutation. Nodules boiled and throbbed on her face and neck. She pushed through the pain and into the grey area. Her eyes glowed as she reached over onto the other side of what was possible and began the process of shedding her mortal coil. This would release a terrible expulsion of energy that would destroy everything around her and more than likely kick you out of the story! Here we were again with her doing the most just to get rid of you and Nero. Interesting though... she was going to go post-physical? Right here and now? Really?

Yup! A third of them were able to leave their bodies behind before Atlantis was washed away into the sea by a wrathful God. The only problem with her trying to transform ‚Äúright here and now‚Äù was that she was essentially hitting the self-destruct button. Crystals were one of the few things that resonated in the post physical realm, and she was too far away from a hub to find her way back home. The Atlanteans had discovered this eons ago when they were first exploring their empath abilities. They incorporated a similar technology to build their crystal nexus when they made the fateful decision to go down the post physical path. Many more would have escaped if not for the fallen angel Ark Haven and his insidious machinations. Like always, he was up to no good and shared with them an alternative method they could use to achieve their goal.

His knowledge came with a terrible secret, but the Atlanteans were too blinded by hubris and ambition to see what he had done. What started as a supernal pursuit soon became an aberrant obsession. They paid the cost and nobly absorbed the loss inflicted upon their society again and again like a hammer blow. They studied and innovated. Built and traded. Several wars, plagues, and famines came to pass before they finally entered the Great Golden Age. A time of peace and prosperity that was spurred on by technology.

The crowning achievement was the Crystal Nexus. The greatest wonder the world has ever known. The tower reached through the clouds like the hand of a titan and blocked out the sun on one half of the City of Atlantis. Their greatness came with pitfall. They had strayed too far from the light. God had had enough and gave them one final warning. Cease tampering with nature or be destroyed. They couldn‚Äôt turn back now. Not when they were so close. They put *everything* they had into one final push and found themselves in the Great Dark Age.

It was a sorrowful state of being that lacked all the meaningful things that had once made them great. Trade, culture, prosperity, rights, everything had been pushed aside in the pursuit of one thing: becoming something more than flesh and blood. See. The terrible secret Ark Haven finally revealed to their Mother Queen was that it would take more than sweat and tears. Heh. That‚Äôs right. They were going to need human sacrifices if they wanted to see their dream through until the end. It was the only way to power the heart of their nexus. Many met their end in these sacrilegious experiments. Often horrible deaths, at the hands of otherworldly beings.

God had no choice. Their crimes against humanity could not go unpunished. And so, he summoned the Great Flood and washed their magnificent city down into the depths of the sea. Only a fraction of the population managed to escape into post physical form in time. As for the Atlanteans that survived the apocalyptic event but were unable to go post physical. They went on to become the Nephilim. Cannibals and cave dwellers who were far removed from the greatness of their ancestors. So deep was God‚Äôs grief, he made a covenant with Noah to never again destroy the world with water. He also forbade the technology conceived by the lost tribes of Atlantis.

\---

Nano was very interested in her transformation process. He studied what she was doing to free herself very carefully. It could be the missing key to their invasion. Dimensional space was like water and post physical was like oil. The two realms did not coexist so much as tolerate each other. Even the angels, who had come to dominate metaphysical space. Even they could not grasp the concept of the post physical and usually tended to ignore it altogether as some kind of distant ‚Äúunreality,‚Äù preferring to focus on hard trans dimensional reality instead, and the previously mentioned ‚Äúmeta-space,‚Äù where they had built their Kingdom of Heaven.

There was one creature who knew. She had infected every dimensional fiber with ink from her black tentacles. All had surrendered to her but heaven. Nano could ask him how she did it, but he was off limits‚Ä¶ *she* had taken him for herself. A sickly smirk withered across his face. His dark hair flowed like black curtains in the killing fields. Lady Darkness was in his eyes, a glint with a hint that told the frightened Atlantean in no uncertain terms, ‚ÄúPlay and you die.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what did you say?‚Äù Freya asked.

‚ÄúI said, sorry about your clone. I know how long it takes to make a new one. *We* had to do something to stop you from killing my student,‚Äù he said in his usual cool manner even going so far as to steal a sip of coffee afterwards. He stood there for a moment studying the desperation in his victim‚Äôs eyes, saying, ‚ÄúYou came here to deliver a message.‚Äù

‚ÄúH-how did you know?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I had a hunch.‚Äù

You see, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) sounds like something straight out of a spy movie, and in a way, it is! **It's designed to make sure US citizens are reporting their foreign financial assets.** And guess what? Even if you're dealing in the glorious, decentralized world of crypto, if those assets are held on a foreign exchange, they might just fall under FATCA's watchful gaze.

It's like this: imagine your crypto wallet on a foreign exchange is a super cool, futuristic vault filled with shiny, shimmering coins.

https://preview.redd.it/m594dz45h9cf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ae33f2387ed4f5c53671953702745a49c11361c

FATCA basically says, ""Hey, US citizen, if that vault gets *really* full (think thresholds like $50,000 for individuals or $100,000 for married couples filing jointly at year-end, or even higher at any point during the year), we need to know about it!"" You'd report it on Form 8938, the ""Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets.""

Now, here's the kicker that might make you spit out your coffee (or your sparkling water, to keep it light): some folks think, ""Aha! I'll just become an expat and live abroad, then my crypto is safe!"" Plot twist! If you remain a US citizen, even living abroad, you're still generally on the hook for US taxes and reporting requirements, including FATCA. So, that dream of a crypto-fueled, tax-free paradise abroad? Not so fast! It's like those shiny legal documents are following you wherever you go!

It's a complex world out there, but knowing about FATCA can save you from some hefty penalties. So, keep those records straight, and may your crypto always be shiny and compliant! ‚ú®",1,1752246779.0,u_Echochainhq,0,1.0,False
1lx9f7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lx9f7g/why_choose_the_breville_smart_kettle_luxe_for/,Why Choose the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe for Your Perfect Brew?,"Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 has been my go-to hot water kettle for over a month now, and it has genuinely transformed the way I go about making my daily tea and coffee. Being someone who thrives on caffeinated beverages, I couldn‚Äôt help but fall for the promise of precise brewing temperatures and smart functionalities that this electric kettle offers. After several weeks of testing, here‚Äôs everything I learned about this brushed stainless steel marvel, from its incredible features to a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Sleek and Sturdy Design**  
The brushed stainless steel finish of this electric kettle practically screams sophistication. It feels premium both in look and touch, easily becoming a centerpiece on my kitchen countertop. Measuring 7 inches in length, 9.5 inches in width, and 9.9 inches in height, it‚Äôs surprisingly compact for something that has a 7-cup water-holding capacity. While its 3.86-pound weight means it‚Äôs not feather-light, the heft gives it a sense of durability and sturdiness that I appreciate. I‚Äôve also noticed the soft-top lid is not just a gimmick. It really helps minimize splash-back and gently releases steam, avoiding those painful moments when steam scorches your hand.  

**Easy-to-Use Temperature Control**  
This kettle isn‚Äôt about just boiling water; it‚Äôs about boiling it smartly. With five temperature settings tailored for different types of tea and French press coffee, I could easily hit the sweet spot for every brew. Whether I was steeping green tea or brewing a robust black tea, the pre-programmed buttons made it foolproof to achieve the right temperature. The accuracy of these settings has genuinely enhanced the flavor profiles, especially for something delicate like white tea, which always gets compromised with too-high water temperatures.  

[Check Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)  

**Perfect for Both Tea and Coffee Lovers**  
One of the standout features is the ""Keep Warm"" functionality, which ensures the water stays at just the right temperature for up to 20 minutes. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been distracted mid-brew only to find my water still perfectly warm when I returned. Coffee enthusiasts in my household were equally pleased; French press coffee came out flavorful without the water temperature burning the grounds or leaving them too weak.

**Winning Points**  
- The intuitive and pre-programmed temperature settings make it accessible even for beginners.  
- High-quality brushed stainless steel ensures durability and a stylish appearance.  
- The soft opening lid is a thoughtful safety feature that minimizes steam burns.  
- Cordless convenience with a 360-degree swivel base is excellent for multi-directional use.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The kettle is on the pricier side compared to other basic electric kettles, though the features compensate for the cost to a degree.  
- It emits a slight buzzing noise when turned on, which may bother people sensitive to kitchen appliance sounds.  
- I wish there was an option to specify custom temperatures beyond the pre-programmed settings. While five is versatile enough, having full control could make it better for niche types of brewing.  

**Industry Competitors**  
Compared to its competitors like the Cuisinart PerfecTemp or Fellow Stagg EKG, I found the Breville's Smart Kettle Luxe stands out in delivering consistent results without much babysitting. While the Fellow Stagg EKG shines in its aesthetics and precision, the Breville offers a slightly more extensive feature set like the Keep Warm function and cordless convenience. The Cuisinart PerfecTemp is cheaper, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same robust build quality or the smooth user experience this kettle delivers. Each has its unique appeal, but for households needing a balance of design, function, and versatility, this kettle takes the edge.  

**Smart Spending**  
Evaluating its cost-efficiency, it does feel like an investment piece. Sure, there are cheaper electric kettles out there, but few can match the precision and features this product provides. If you‚Äôre particular about the quality of your tea or coffee brewing experience, it‚Äôs hard to argue against the value you get here. You‚Äôre not just buying a kettle; you‚Äôre upgrading your entire drink-making process.

1lx9ebw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx9ebw,"Finally, a Bookkeeping System for People Who Hate Bookkeeping","# Hate Bookkeeping? Here's the Absolute Simplest Way to Stay Organized.

Let's be honest, you didn't start your own business because you have a burning passion for spreadsheets and financial statements. You're a creator, a consultant, a maker, a doer. The very word ""bookkeeping"" is enough to send a shiver of dread down the spine of even the most seasoned solopreneur. It's that nagging task on your to-do list that's perpetually pushed to ""later,"" a growing pile of receipts in a shoebox, and a vague sense of anxiety about tax time.

But what if you could implement a ""bare minimum"" system that keeps you organized, empowers you to make smarter business decisions, and saves you from a world of pain when the taxman comes knocking?

This isn't about becoming a certified public accountant overnight. This is about creating a simple, sustainable, and surprisingly empowering bookkeeping setup that works for you, the busy solopreneur.

# Your 1-Hour Quick-Start Guide

Feeling overwhelmed? Don't read another word. Just do these three things in the next hour. This is your first, giant leap towards financial sanity.

1. **Open a Fee-Free Business Checking Account Online.** Go to a bank you already use or an online-only bank. All you need is a dedicated space for business income and expenses. Do it now.
2. **Sign Up for a Free Bookkeeping Software Trial.** Choose one from the toolkit below (Wave is free forever). Connect your new business bank account. This will take 10 minutes.
3. **Schedule a Weekly ""Money Date"" in Your Calendar.** Block out 30 minutes for the same time every week. When the reminder pops up, your only job is to open your bookkeeping software and categorize the transactions from the past week. That's it.

Done? Amazing. You've just built the foundation of a solid bookkeeping system. Now, let's explore why this matters.

# The Real Cost of Ignoring Your Books (It's More Than Just Money)

Before we dive into the ""how,"" let's get real about the ""why."" Neglecting your bookkeeping isn't just about a messy office. It has tangible, often stressful, consequences:

* **Missed Tax Deductions:** Every forgotten coffee meeting with a client, every unrecorded software subscription, is money you're leaving on the table. Proper tracking ensures you claim every legitimate deduction you're entitled to.
* **Chronic Financial Anxiety:** When you don't know your numbers, you're flying blind. You're left guessing about your profitability, your cash flow, and whether you can afford that new piece of equipment. This uncertainty is a major source of stress for many solopreneurs.
* **Poor Business Decisions:** Should you raise your rates? Can you afford to hire a virtual assistant? Without a clear picture of your financial health, these critical decisions are based on gut feelings rather than hard data.
* **A Nightmare at Tax Time:** The frantic, last-minute scramble to organize a year's worth of financial records is a recipe for errors, missed deadlines, and potentially costly penalties.
* **Roadblocks to Growth:** If you ever want to apply for a business loan, a grant, or even just get a clear sense of your business's value, you'll need accurate financial records.

Think of your bookkeeping not as a chore, but as the control panel for your business. It's the source of truth that tells you what's working, what's not, and where you're headed.

# The Three Pillars of a ""Bare Minimum"" Bookkeeping Setup

Ready to build a system that won't make you want to tear your hair out? Here are the three non-negotiable pillars of a simple and effective bookkeeping setup for any solopreneur.

# Pillar 1: The Great Separation - Your Business Finances Deserve Their Own Home

This is the single most important step you can take to simplify your bookkeeping. Commingling your personal and business finances is a one-way ticket to chaos. Imagine trying to untangle your grocery bill from your client invoices at the end of the year. No, thank you.

**Your Actionable To-Do List:**

1. **Open a Dedicated Business Bank Account:** This is non-negotiable. All income from your business should be deposited into this account, and all business expenses should be paid from it. Most banks offer business checking accounts with low or no fees.
2. **Get a Business Credit or Debit Card:** Use this card exclusively for business purchases. This creates a clean, easily trackable record of your spending.
3. **Pay Yourself a Salary:** Instead of randomly dipping into your business account for personal expenses, establish a regular transfer from your business account to your personal account. This ""owner's draw"" or ""salary"" makes your personal income predictable and keeps your business finances pristine.

**Best Practice Tip:** When you receive a payment from a client, adopt the ""Profit First"" principle in its simplest form: immediately transfer a percentage (a good starting point is 25-30%) into a separate savings account specifically for taxes. This way, you won't be caught off guard by a hefty tax bill.

# Pillar 2: Track Everything - The Art of Effortless Expense and Income Management

Once you've separated your finances, the next step is to diligently track every dollar that comes in and goes out of your business. The key here is to make this process as automated and painless as possible.

**Your DIY Bookkeeping Toolkit**

|Tool|Best For|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**QuickBooks Solopreneur**|The All-Rounder|Specifically for solopreneurs, great tax estimation, simple interface, easy receipt capture.|Monthly fee after trial.|
|**FreshBooks**|Service-Based Freelancers|Excellent invoicing and time-tracking, very intuitive and user-friendly.|Can be pricier than other options.|
|**Wave**|The Budget-Conscious Starter|**Free!** Solid invoicing and accounting. A perfect starting point.|Basic features, mobile app is for receipt scanning only.|
|**MileIQ / Everlance**|The Road Warrior|Automatically tracks business mileage using your phone's GPS for easy deductions.|Subscription-based.|

**Your Actionable To-Do List:**

1. **Choose Your Weapon & Connect Your Accounts:** The magic of modern bookkeeping software lies in its ability to connect directly to your business bank account and credit card. This means your transactions are automatically imported, saving you hours of manual data entry.
2. **The Weekly ""Money Date"":** Keep that 30-minute weekly appointment with yourself. During this time, you'll categorize your expenses (e.g., ""office supplies,"" ""software subscriptions,"" ""client meals""), and make sure everything is in order. A consistent weekly habit is far less daunting than a massive year-end cleanup.

**Best Practice Tip:** Use your software's receipt-scanning app. When you buy something for your business, snap a photo of the receipt immediately. This eliminates the dreaded shoebox of faded receipts and ensures you have a digital record of every expense.

# Pillar 3: Know Your Numbers - Understanding the Story Your Finances Tell

You don't need to be a Wall Street analyst to understand the financial health of your business. For a solopreneur, there's really only one key financial report you need to consistently review: the **Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement**.

The P&L statement (sometimes called an ""Income Statement"") is a simple summary of your income and expenses over a specific period (e.g., a month, a quarter, a year). It answers the fundamental question: **""Am I making money?""**

**A Simplified P&L Looks Like This:**

* **Income:**
   * Client Payments: $10,000
* **Total Income: $10,000**
* **Expenses:**
   * Software Subscriptions: $150
   * Home Office Expenses: $300
   * Marketing and Advertising: $500
   * Contractor Payments: $1,000
   * Business Travel: $400
* **Total Expenses: $2,350**
* **Net Profit (or Loss): $7,650**

**Your Actionable To-Do List:**

1. **Generate Your P&L Statement Monthly:** Your bookkeeping software can create this report for you with a single click.
2. **Ask Yourself These Questions:**
   * Is my income growing, shrinking, or staying the same?
   * What are my biggest expenses? Are there any I can reduce?
   * Am I consistently profitable?
   * How does this month compare to last month or the same month last year?

**Best Practice Tip:** Don't just look at the numbers. Use them to make informed decisions. For example, if you see your software expenses creeping up, you might decide to cancel a subscription you're no longer using. If your income is stagnant, it might be a sign that it's time to raise your rates or seek out new clients.

# Making Tax Time a Breeze: A Year-Round Approach

The beauty of this ""bare minimum"" bookkeeping setup is that it makes tax time significantly less stressful. When you've been diligently tracking your income and expenses all year, you won't have to scramble.

**Your Tax Prep Checklist:**

* **Pay Your Quarterly Estimated Taxes:** As a solopreneur, you must pay income and self-employment taxes throughout the year. Mark these deadlines on your calendar:
   * **April 15** (for Jan 1 - Mar 31 income)
   * **June 15** (for Apr 1 - May 31 income)
   * **September 15** (for Jun 1 - Aug 31 income)
   * **January 15** of next year (for Sep 1 - Dec 31 income)
* **Know Your Deductions:** Common tax deductions for solopreneurs include:
   * **Home Office:** You can use the **Simplified Method** (a standard deduction of $5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft) or the **Actual Expense Method** (tracking a percentage of your actual home expenses like mortgage interest, rent, utilities, etc.).
   * Business software and subscriptions
   * Office supplies & equipment
   * Marketing and advertising costs
   * Business mileage and travel
   * A portion of your health insurance premiums
   * Professional development and education
   * Business meals (with clients)

# When to Call in a Pro: Leveling Up Your Financial Game

This DIY system is perfect for most solopreneurs. But as your business grows, you might reach a point where doing it all yourself is no longer the best use of your time.

**Signs It's Time to Hire a Bookkeeper or CPA:**

* You're spending more than a few hours a month on bookkeeping.
* Your business is growing rapidly, with multiple income streams and complex expenses.
* You're considering hiring your first employee or contractor.
* You want to make a major business change, like forming an LLC or S-Corp.
* You simply hate doing it and the stress outweighs the cost of hiring help.

A good bookkeeper can manage your day-to-day records, while a CPA can provide high-level tax planning and business advice.

# You've Got This: From Bookkeeping Hater to Financially Empowered Solopreneur

The ""bare minimum"" bookkeeping setup isn't about adding another complicated task to your already overflowing plate. It's about creating a simple, sustainable system that removes financial uncertainty and empowers you to build a more profitable and resilient business.

Start today. Open that business bank account. Sign up for a free trial of a bookkeeping software. Schedule your first ""money date."" In just a few small steps, you can transform your relationship with your finances from one of dread to one of clarity and control.

1lx9cb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lx9cb5/explore_the_keurig_kclassic_coffee_maker_review/,Explore the Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker review: Worth it for single-serve brewing?,"Testing the Keurig K-Classic Single Serve Coffee Maker Model K-50 has been an overall pleasant experience, but (as with any product) there are some highlights and a few areas where it could improve. The simplicity and functionality of this classic coffee maker make it an appealing choice for anyone looking to brew a smooth cup of coffee swiftly.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Upon unboxing the coffee machine, what stood out instantly is its clean, no-fuss aesthetic. The matte black finish fits effortlessly into a variety of kitchen setups, from minimalistic to traditionally styled spaces. I found its dimensions‚Äî9.8 inches deep, 13.3 inches wide, and 13 inches high‚Äîcompact enough for my small counter while still leaving room to prep meals. Weighing just 9 pounds, the Keurig K-Classic was easy to reposition when needed. The buttons aren‚Äôt overly complicated either; I appreciated that they‚Äôre straightforward, making it accessible to my semi-tech-averse dad as well.

**Operation and Simplicity**  
Brewing with this machine is as uncomplicated as it gets. Insert a pod, choose between the three brew sizes (6, 8, or 10 ounces), and in under a minute, you have your coffee. The system is foolproof for those days when I can barely string two thoughts together without caffeine. A friend of mine who visited was delighted by how intuitive the process was, even as a first-time user of a Keurig product. Having programmable features like the auto-off setting, which powers down the machine after two idle hours, felt like a nice touch for energy conservation.

[Check Keurig K-50 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b018uq5ams/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker delivers a consistent, reliable brew every time. Whether I used Green Mountain Coffee, Starbucks, or the occasional tea pod, the results were flavorful and satisfying. The 6-ounce size has become my go-to for a stronger cup of coffee during groggy mornings. My sister experimented with flavored pods and hot cocoa, and she was thrilled with the vibrant tastes these options delivered. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that achieving perfect brewing pressure can require some trial and error if you opt to grind your own coffee. I used the reusable My K-Cup filter and noticed slight inconsistencies depending on grind size and tamping, but nothing that ruined the experience.

**Saving Time with the Reservoir**  
The 48-ounce removable water reservoir is a feature I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I had it. Refilling water every 6+ cups instead of after every use has streamlined my mornings, especially on busy workdays when coffee is more survival than luxury. Cleaning and refilling the tank were hassle-free since it detaches easily. However, if left unchecked, mineral deposits can build up over time, requiring descaling‚Äîa process Keurig specifically recommends.

**Perks**  
- Straightforward and user-friendly operation with simple button controls.  
- Quickly brews a cup of coffee in under a minute, perfect for morning rushes.  
- Large water reservoir minimizes the frequency of refills.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Users need to pay attention to grind size and tamping when using non-pod coffee.  
- While reliable, it lacks finer modern touches like an adjustable temperature setting for brewing.

**Other Options**  
If you‚Äôre considering this model, some competitive alternatives come to mind. For instance, the Keurig K-Elite offers temperature controls and a stronger brew option but comes at a higher price point. Meanwhile, brands like Nespresso have machines delivering more refined espresso, though they‚Äôre typically pricier and use proprietary pods exclusively. Compared to any other single-serve brewers in this range, however, this product nailed the balance of affordability, speed, and flexibility.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given its features, the value provided fits well within its price bracket. The programmable auto-off function, reusable My K-Cup compatibility, and multiple pod-size options make it worth the investment if you prioritize convenience. That said, spending a little extra on descaling solutions or reusable filters is sadly unavoidable, but these add-ons are minor compared to its overall benefits.

1lx97hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lx97hb/does_the_keurig_kiced_coffee_maker_really_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker Really Deliver Perfect Iced Brews?,"Testing the Keurig K-Iced 5000371871 has been like stepping into a personal caf√© every morning without ever leaving my kitchen. With its sleek, compact gray design and dual coffee capabilities, it immediately caught my eye and quickly became an essential part of my daily routine. As someone who enjoys switching between steaming hot java and refreshing iced coffee, this product seemed tailored for people like me. The blue ""Brew Over Ice"" button intrigued me the most‚Äîit promised to craft iced coffee without watering down the flavor. I was cautiously optimistic, but curiosity quickly won out.

**Standout Design and Build Quality**  
This single-serve coffee maker is impressively compact, measuring 12.9‚ÄùD x 5.1‚ÄùW x 12.6‚ÄùH, so it nestled perfectly on my crowded kitchen countertop. The gray finish feels modern and clean, blending with different kitchens effortlessly. What truly adds to the convenience is the 42-ounce removable reservoir. Refilling it is easy, and while I expected to top it up daily, I managed to squeeze out four brews before needing to refill it. The removable drip tray also accommodates taller travel mugs and tumblers‚Äîa lifesaver during my chaotic mornings when I‚Äôm rushing to get out the door.

**Innovative Brewing Features**  
Using the Keurig K-Iced felt intuitive right from the start, thanks to the simple button interface. The ""Brew Over Ice"" feature stood out as a game changer. It heats the water appropriately to extract flavor, then cools it down before pouring, ensuring no excess ice melts. I brewed an iced coffee the other day, and it tasted rich, vibrant, and not diluted‚Äîa rare find compared to my previous coffee machines. When it came to hot coffee, the ""Strong Brew"" option got a solid thumbs-up from both my partner and me. They like bold coffee, and this setting delivered that deep, intense flavor.

**Key Benefits**  
- Blue ""Brew Over Ice"" button for perfect iced coffee.  
- Strong Brew option adds a richer taste for hot coffee drinkers.  
- 42-ounce water reservoir allows for multiple brews between refills.  

[Check Keurig K-Iced 5000371871 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bsmgnyn3/)

**Energy Efficiency That Matters**  
I‚Äôm impressed with how the coffee maker helps save energy. It automatically powers off five minutes after the last brew, easing some of my eco-conscious guilt. This might seem like a small perk, but it‚Äôs surprising how much of a difference this kind of thoughtful feature can make over time.

**Compatibility with K-Cups and Beyond**  
The convenience of popping in a K-Cup pod to brew is appreciated, but I enjoy varying my coffee blends. Thankfully, this machine supports Keurig's My K-Cup Universal Coffee Filter (sold separately), allowing me to use my own ground coffee. My coworker lent me their filter, and I tried one of my specialty roasts. It worked just as smoothly as the prepackaged pods, adding versatility to the product‚Äôs appeal. 

**Negatives**  
- The water reservoir, although well-sized, isn‚Äôt detachable for dishwasher cleaning.  
- It doesn‚Äôt come with the My K-Cup Filter; you have to buy it separately.  

**Competitive Options**  
When pitted against other single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Vertuo or even other Keurig models, the Keurig K-Iced stands out for its unique ""Brew Over Ice"" feature. The Nespresso, however, shines with its frothing capabilities, making it a better fit for latte and cappuccino lovers. Meanwhile, the Keurig Duo has a slightly larger reservoir, but it lacks the specialized iced coffee setting. The streamlined design of the K-Iced also makes it more space-efficient for smaller kitchens. If you prioritize versatility and beverage options, the K-Iced might tip the scales in its favor for daily use.

**Value Assessment**  
When evaluating the price-performance ratio, the Keurig K-Iced feels worth every penny. Dual brewing functionality, combined with a focus on both iced and hot coffee, ensures it caters to diverse coffee cravings. While some accessories are missing and the reservoir cleaning could be more user-friendly, these drawbacks don‚Äôt outweigh the benefits. The energy-efficient auto-off feature and customized strength settings add layers of value that are hard to beat in this price range.

What I am looking for now is genuine feedback from the community:

* Which of these fragrances are worth sampling !?  
* Are there any underrated gems I should consider instead !?    
* Are there better value alternatives with similar performance or scent profiles !?

Here‚Äôs my current list (not ranked):

I 20F was on dating apps and started talking to this boy 23(?)M and after a bit of texting i invited him over, we had plans to smoke weed and watch a movie.

when he came over he brought this nice tall bong that had previously been patched up with electric tape near the stem, i offered to make him coffee and made us both a cup.

 as planned we smoked and \*netflix and chilled\*, it was all going well until it was time for him to go home.

he had set his bong on the edge of my counter and as i was putting away the coffee making supplies i accidentally knocked over his bong and it fell to the ground, breaking the stem part clean off (not the part which had been previously patched up) and i felt EXTREMELY bad and profusely apologized, he made sure to reassure me that he wasnt mad and it wasnt a big deal.

he didnt bring it up and we actually hooked up twice more after that without mention of the broken bong ever except jokingly, he hadnt asked me to pay him back for anything until a few weeks later when i sensed he was catching feelings for me (talking about future plans, even bringing up spending christmas with my family??)

he was ultimately starting to weird me out a little and i told him i really was not intending on dating him and only wanted to be FWB at most but even then it was getting too weird for me, he got pretty upset and texted me verbatim ""you broke my heart and my bong, i cant expect you to repair my heart but you could pay me back for the latter"" 

i was a little confused because 1) i did NOT break his heart, we knew eachother for barely a month and 2) he had NEVER asked me to pay it back until i ""rejected"" him. i had no money at the time and really couldnt pay even if i wanted to so i told him i would when i could, expecting him to get over me and let it go but he kept intermittently texting me every few weeks asking for the money (despite him having a job, and multiple other bongs)

i was really confused as to why he wanted the money since frankly i dont think he really needs it and when i bring it up to him he blames me for the accident and says it was my fault and i owe him money, i ultimately blocked him because he was getting pretty annoying.

I (25F) am coming up to my fourth year of sobriety and have been in the rooms for the last two years. I find meetings, seeing others achieve longer term sobriety and share there stories encouraging and motivating. I‚Äôve struggled with cross addictions since I was thirteen years old with my biggest struggle being drinking. Now I am within the fellowship - I do find sobriety easier and I find myself happier than when I was trying to do so without it.

For me, I‚Äôve often found some elements of getting sober so young interesting. 
After a year of sober time I started dating, trying to make friends and expanding my horizons to making connections with people. I found it astounding - the amount of people that would decline dates, or friendships on the sole basis of the fact that I live a sober lifestyle.

I‚Äôve been wanting to start a social group for young individuals (18-35) that have gotten sober and I think it could be good idea. Ofcourse I have the fellowship and have made good connections and friendships but in a lot of ways meetings for me is where I connect to my sobriety and gain hope.

Some of the social activities I was thinking about were things like game nights in coffee shops, picnics, cinema trips, even pottery nights ect. Where we just chat, make connections and have fun with other sober, likeminded individuals whether inside or outside of the rooms.

I‚Äôm sure this has been done before. But theirs nothing like that in my hometown and I‚Äôm just wondering if this is a good idea or if it would take the interest of sober individuals? And if it isn‚Äôt a good idea - what makes it not a good idea?

Mind you 1yr pa lang ako nag momoba tas every now and then nakakasalubong ko sya sa coffee shop malapit sa Bahay.

Sometimes I'd do a couple of games with them and then go on with my business.

Wala naman sakin un, tamang banter at asaran lang around the game ang interaction.

But a couple of months ago, nag escalate 
Ang isa sa kanila, where nag aaya na sya lagi Ng laro with just me and then pag free tlga ako nag pipilit pa mag kita sa milk tea shops nearby.

Akala ko nambuburaot lang Ng libre meryenda, no big deal nmn sakin un.

Pero hinde ehh, last month nag start na sya maging touchy tas ngaun na sandal na sakin rtc.

These past few weeks kung kausapin nya ako pabulong na, where she'd be so close that I can smell the flavor of milk tea she's drinking.

Napansin ko din na di na nonsense mga topics namin, nag tatanung na sya Ng career and life questions etc.

Tas pag di ako maka online, nag tatanung sya kung anu gawa ko or sino Kasama ko.

One time, 2-3days ako offline Kasi NASA hike ako tas nag video call talaga sya to check tas nag papabebe tampo na dapat nagpaalam ako pra di daw sya nag alala.


Ang problem, 18 pa lang ang batang eto, technically adult na pero di ko tlga Siya bet. 

May istura naman, di matatawag na panget in any physical aspect, but she has the nene vibes pa.

Kaya tamang de escelate lang ako at shift to kenkoy pag magiging serious ang usapan.

Kaso this week lang  nang hihiram sya sakin Ng cash 1500, kala ko nag pakita na Ng tunay na kulay haha.

Pang gastos sa skwela lang nmn, sinabe ko na di ako nag papautang unless may collateral.(Learned a hard lesson about that back in my 20s)

Jusko, ang ginawa nag send Ng sad selfie wearing a sando, bakat nipples na.

Sabay sabi na Wala sya ma collateral.

Medyo na gulat ako sa pag full speed nya, tbh medyo na arrouse na ako sa offer pero kinakabahan pa din ako.

Fasting glucose: 94

HOMA-IR: 1.2 (I calculated this myself from an online calculator) 

  
According to chat GPT my results indicate I should still exercise caution as I am quite close to the pre diabetes range of blood glucose according to my A1C. So I am wondering if I should perhaps use a GCM to get a little more information about what might be causing spikes.

1lx8v83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1lx8v83/great_experience_with_coblation/,Great experience with coblation,"Given all the painful experiences recounted on this sub, I was prepared for the worst. Instead, I‚Äôm very pleased to be here conveying a highly positive experience I‚Äôve just had with extracapsular coblation. I can‚Äôt say for sure how much of my positive experience is due to coblation rather than other subjective factors, but at the very least I‚Äôm happy to provide one positive, anecdotal data point. All in all, I believe coblation is not discussed here enough as a superior alternative to other techniques and should be actively sought out by those who need the procedure.

TLDR and daily breakdown are below. I‚Äôm also happy to answer any questions you may have. For those not looking forward to the surgery: it may not be as bad as you think. There is hope!

**TLDR**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Had an extracapsular coblation in addition to 25% uvula reduction (not coblation)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pain levels *never* went above a 4/10

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Would more accurately describe the experience as very uncomfortable rather than painful. Paracetamol was always enough to tame it.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Never experienced even a spot of bleeding despite eating soft but solid food from Day 2 onward

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The hardest parts were sleeping (would wake up gagging on saliva) and early mornings (throat dry from sleeping) during days 2-5

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As everyone says, maximum hydration is KEY and ice-cold coconut water was a savior

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Diet that got me through the first few days = coconut water, scrambled eggs, shredded chicken, poached fish, chopped + sauteed vegetables, pastina with pesto, smoothies, ice cream, sorbet

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I did not avoid dairy. Unless you're vegan, milk + yogurt are easy, healthy calories + protein.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Able to comfortably spend significant time out of the house by Day 6

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Able to maintain a 60-minute conversation with manageable discomfort by Day 7

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Caveats: I had my procedure performed at a world-class hospital and took ten days off of work to fully rest and focus on healing, which are luxuries not everyone can afford. That said, I‚Äôm also single so had to cook all my own food and manage my own errands.

**Daily breakdown**

Day 1: Procedure performed early morning, awoke around noon and spent night in hospital. Was hard to swallow and uncomfortable but the pain never went above a 3 or 4. I declined morphine as paracetamol was enough to manage it. Hardest part sleeping as I had a lot of saliva and would wake up not choking exactly, but sort of gagging in a non-dangerous but annoying kind of way where I would have to force a swallow, change positions, and try to fall asleep again.

Day 2: Discharged around noon. Was STARVING so I sauteed and shredded a chicken breast + cooked some spinach and chopped carrots in broth. Swallowing was difficult but even at this point, less than 48 hours from the procedure, was able to get down soft and well-chewed but solid food. Pain levels 2-3.

Days 3-5: Sleeping was difficult as I would wake up gagging on saliva, and mornings just after waking was the hardest, as my throat would be dry. But after some paracetamol and ice cold coconut water, things would get easier. Diet consisted of eggs, smoothies, poached fish, soft veggies, shredded chicken, pastina with pesto, ice cream, and coffee. Throat would be sorest after eating/swallowing and remained very uncomfortable but rarely painful.

Day 4: Tried to leave the house but was overwhelmed after about twenty minutes in the supermarket. Was too soon.

Day 5: I was able to get down soft pizza (Pizza Hut) as a treat for dinner.

Day 6: First day I could spend significant time outside of the house without getting very fatigued. Spent 3-4 hours shopping and running errands using public transportation and taxis. Biggest challenge was remaining hydrated between the blazing outdoor heat and aggressive indoor A/C. Managed a bit of bread with my dinner as a treat.

Day 7: Had my one-week follow-up with the surgeon, who said my tonsils were healing nicely but the uvula was still quite swollen. He suspected the lingering discomfort I was experiencing was more due to my uvula (which still had an undissolved suture in it) than my tonsils. He expected a nearly full recovery by Day 14 and complete recovery by Day 21. He showed me a photo of my tonsils, which were 4cm \* 2cm each when removed, or TWICE what the normal size should have been. I went straight from the hospital to lunch and had linguine with clams + chatted with a friend for 60 minutes. Then took a two-hour flight, which was an approximately six-hour journey door-to-door. No major discomfort.

Day 8: This is toay, and at this point I am reintroducing mild spice into my food and only avoiding very crispy/crunch textures, acids/citrus, chili. I still have a few more days off from work and I‚Äôm still taking it easy, allowing my body to devote as much energy as possible to healing. That said, pain levels are a 1-2 and the procedure is no longer front-of-mind.",1,1752245415.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

1lx8sqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1lx8sqa/did_or_bpd/,DID or BPD?,"Good morning. I don't think I only have a Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). My therapist told me to let go of dissociation, saying it's not within their expertise, but I'm looking for answers. In an EMDR session, I said that Giorgia (me) was dead. My DBT therapist always had the impression that I appeared integrated and healthy in therapy, but at home, I caused chaos. Besides, now Giorgia isn't dead and wants to understand what on earth happened for three years. With the community therapist, I'm working on strengthening the adult part, and it's finally present 80% of the time. I'm happy.
Only, inside me, there's an extremely unhappy and borderline child part. But I, fundamentally, am healthy. When the child part acts, I don't recognize myself in my actions. How do I know there's a child part? I saw her face. One night three years ago, when that part took possession of me, my pupils dilated, my lips swelled, and my posture changed. I looked in the mirror, and I swear I had the angelic face of a child. I then felt a push below my sternum and screamed desperately because I didn't know what the hell had happened. For months, that child part took over me ‚Äì what am I saying, years. She was afraid of everything because she was born into a dysfunctional family, and no one could contain her. She only found containment in psychiatry. She would say things like ""I'm scared of my parents,"" ""I'm disgusting,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I lost consciousness,"" ""I'm scared of the dark,"" and I swear on my life that for the first few months, she had a childlike voice.
I know I have two distinct identities, and no one here seems to believe me. I don't really know how dissociation works; I've done some research to understand, but I don't think I have an identity disorder but something beyond borderline is definitely there, and I'd like someone to tell me what. I'm tired of not feeling understood. Let me explain better what I'm talking about. I rarely have borderline crises, and every time I attempted suicide or cut myself, I was dissociated, felt nothing, and didn't recognize myself in those actions! Not even with promiscuous sex. In fact, all these behaviors stopped as soon as I ""returned."" A miraculous cure? I don't think so. It's just that now the borderline child part is simply less present, and when it is present (what I call a crisis), it usually lasts one or two hours, and then I return to myself. But then I have the feeling that it wasn't me acting.
I know all this doesn't just fall under borderline. Plus, I have serious amnesia problems. I don't remember anything from the path I took with the DBT psychotherapist; I only have a few memories, and the same goes for the therapy I'm currently undergoing (I remember telling him at the beginning that I have suicidal thoughts, I remember crying once, I remember him offering me coffee at the end). I don't even remember what I told my friend today when I went out for coffee with her; I don't remember anything about my relationship with A. except that we saw each other at my place or his, but I remember having the experience, just not the content of it. And the neurologist told me my brain is healthy, so there are no neurological causes (because I complained to him about this memory problem too).
Today, the child part was present for two hours because I was disappointed with how the psychotherapy session went, so it reawakened. Immediately, I said I wanted to leave the community, that no one understands me, I was saying childish phrases like ""I want to go home now""; I seemed like a completely different person, it was impossible to reason with me. Then the team spoke to me, and I came back to myself and apologized to everyone. But do you believe me when I say it's not me? Please believe me and give me some answers. I don't suffer from emotional dysregulation; I feel nothing most of the time because I am emotionally split. Dissociation, in my opinion, plays a huge role in my experience, and I'd like you to help me understand, because here I feel they don't understand me. And if I ask the psychiatrist, they'd say I'm looking for another diagnosis to ""be sick."" I don't want another diagnosis to ""be sick""; I want another diagnosis to understand myself better.

I do 80% espresso (half the time espresso other half milk drink) and 20% pour over (V60). I buy fresh beans from local roster medium to dark roast usually.

Right now I wonder if I should add an entry level flat burr like the df54 or a more expensive timemore 064s. The bigger ounterspace footprint won't be a plus but I probably can make it work.

I am exploring fresh beans as much as I can and my best friend just offered me a coffee subscription.

Adam woke up in cold sweat. At the edge of the bed stood Captain Jargy Mutt with a bloody hand, pointing at him, his throat cut by his own hand. The voice was gargling, accusing him of something.

‚ÄúGo away!‚Äù Adam said, but the ghost stayed, so Adam got out of the bed, walked over to push him, but his hands went straight through. The eyes of the ghost were glowing with hate, but it could not see him, nor could Adam push him back. Adam closed his eyes and calmed himself, and as he did, the ghost faded away. He looked at Evelyn, she had not woken up and the babies seemed to be deep in sleep as well.

Only Sisu was awake and looking at him. She jumped down and walked past him, stroking her body against his leg, and vanished out the door. It was probably a good idea, so got quickly dressed and he walked down to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee. He stopped as he saw Archangel standing in the hallway in guard mode.

‚ÄùAnything to report?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, everything is calm, your heart rate has calmed down as well.‚Äù He replied in his metallic voice, and Adam looked at him.

‚ÄúActivate the voice module. Let's give you a voice. Let‚Äôs see. I really like that actor.. ohh old movie about 200 years old. Pentdragon.¬† There was an actor, Jason Caville. Yes, a British accent, not too formal but more formal than most.¬† Can you find it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Archangel replied, and Adam smiled. ‚ÄúGood, download his speech pattern and implement. Oh, and open the behaviour program and allow yourself more freedom. Primary duty is to protect the Family and its survival.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs the sir commands!‚Äù¬† Archangel replied, and Adam chuckled. He could not understand why he hadn‚Äôt done this before. Evelyn would freak out when she finds out.

‚ÄúGood. Okay, im going to the kitchen and the home office, You.‚Äù#

‚ÄúSomebody in the Kitchen, Sir. Energy reading indicates Machile and Elp N‚ÄôSert.‚Äù

¬†Then a light projected from his eyes showing the hologram of the kitchen where the two were sitting.

‚ÄúDO you want me to toss 'em out?‚Äù Archangel said, and Adam looked at the droid, then towards the kitchen.

‚ÄúNo, I will deal with this.‚Äù He replied as he walked into the kitchen, where the two were sitting at the kitchen table, each with a cup of coffee, and a free chair with a cup waiting for him. It felt like being called into the administration's office.

‚ÄúWhat's this about?‚Äù He asked as he walked over and sat down, looking at the two. Elp indicated to Machile, who looked at him disappointed. His disguise had been dropped, likely to demonstrate to Adam just how serious this was.

‚ÄúYou killed him!‚Äù Machile said flatly, as if stating a fact.

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt! Besides, everybody is happy he is gone.‚Äù Adam replied, and Machile sighed and looked at Elp.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt cut his throat yourself, but you might as well have done it. You made him do it!‚Äù Elp said a little softer.

‚ÄúIs this a dream? Fuck. I‚Äôm still in a dream about that stupid fu..‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dream about him?‚Äù Machile said, confused. ‚ÄúPerhaps there is still hope.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Elp put his hand on Adams and squeezed until it became painful, and he dropped it.¬† ‚ÄúThis is not a dream, this is very serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you could just have told me‚Äù

‚ÄúYou would not have believed it. Anyway. This is not a dream, and you have to admit you killed him.‚Äù Elp said.

‚ÄúAnd make amends,‚Äù Machile said, and Adam glared at him.

‚ÄúNo, not amends. Not for him!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou killed him!‚Äù Machile said.

‚ÄúI killed his father, too! I ordered thousands of pirates to be killed in combat. I allow Roks to go berserk on those who attack us.‚Äù Adam replied. ‚ÄúNone of them count?¬† I can kill those with no problem, but when that pirate attacks me, threatens my children and wife, I‚Äôm supposed to forgive him? I‚Äôm not a saint!‚Äù Adam said.

‚ÄúThose were before you became Galios, you can't do that now!‚Äù

‚ÄúIM NOT GALIOS!‚Äù Adam stood up, staring at Machile. ‚ÄúStop this fucking nonsense! I‚Äôm Adam Wrangler! A HUMAN! Get that into your thick skull!. If you threaten my family, then I‚Äôm not forgiving you! Yes, I killed him, I killed him with words, but he still had the choice! He chose death!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe had no choice!‚Äù Machile said, and Adam gritted his teeth as he put his finger on his chest.

‚ÄúBullshit! There is always a choice!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou would have taken away his future! There was no life left for him. He would be a husk of a man!‚Äù Machile said, stood up, his form looking bigger than before, more intimidating. Elp tried to calm them down, but none of them even heard what he was saying.

‚ÄúNo future? I was made with no future! I have clawed my way out of nothingness, made deals with devils, and smiled while I‚Äôve been used and abused. But I‚Äôm still HERE! And no fucking angel is going to tell me what I can and cannot do or what MY future has in stall for me! It's my future, just as he had his. A Fucking unwritten future that none of us know. Not even a stuck-up alien like you! Now get the hell out of my home!‚Äù

Adam glared down at the glowing man, and suddenly the room was dimly lit as he was alone. Upstairs, he heard the twins crying, so he cursed under his breath as he ran to help an upset wife and scared babies.

Two days later, Adam was sitting in the office, the light was dimmed, and he was drifting in and out of sleep. Every time he tried to sleep the damn ghost appeared. There was a knock on the door, and Sor Hynam was standing there. Adam sighed and let him come in.

‚ÄúAre you going to defend that old fart?‚Äù Adam said, and Sor shook his head.

‚ÄúNo, he and his kind are very stubborn. Stuck in their ways. I guess when your civilization spans millions of years, you become like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why are you here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause of your nightmares, and because I want to help. This would be so much easier with the master of dreams around.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaster of dreams? How do you know about my Nightmares... of those two couldn‚Äôt keep their mouth shut.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think it's just those two? Everybody has noticed. You're closed up.¬† You don‚Äôt speak to anybody. Evelyn thought you were angry at her.‚Äù He said and Adam looked at him confused.

‚ÄúWhat? I thought she was upset with me. Wait, why are you here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause your wife sent for me. This isn‚Äôt something Roks can help you with. And Elp and Machile are‚Ä¶ well, they see too much. And thinks they know all the answers. Anyway, I‚Äôm here because your wife asked me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so what is the cure for this madness?‚Äù Adam said, and Sor smiled.

‚ÄúThat is up to you, I‚Äôm here to tell you to go fishing!‚Äù

‚ÄúFishing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, take the friends out fishing. Just enjoy yourself out in the sun. We, Dushin, have learned that sometimes you just need a break. If you can fix it the way it's now, then take a step back. Do something else and just relax your mind. So go fishing, have a few beers, and let the universe do its thing. It won't stop just because you go away, and it sure won't stop just because you doubt your decision.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt my decision!‚Äù Adam said, slightly annoyed, that the fishing trip sounded nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you having nightmares about him, of all people. There is something you have unresolved. Something that your mind is trying to tell you, and you refuse to see it. So stop all of this. Take a break and let your mind talk to you.¬† You need a break from the universe.‚Äù Sor said as he stood up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure Jork has something you can use. Maybe you've got a cabin on an island where you can relax for a few days. Take a break. Let the kids play on the beach.‚Äù Sor smiled at him as Adam thought about it. It wasn‚Äôt a bad idea. He could definitely need a break.

A few days later, the ship landed on a small tropical island with several bungalows and a staff of mostly mudskin droids. A slightly overweight, elderly Rista man named Joremi-al. His family lived nearby, in one of the underwater farms. He smiled warmly at them as the droids helped them settle. There were fifteen houses, but they only needed eleven. The island itself was little over 2 square kilometres, made of an ancient, dead volcano. It was a nice hideaway from the world, and the shield kept the area hidden from satellites and prying eyes, while also ensuring the air was breathable.

Adam felt calmer here, the first night he slept through it with no nightmare, the second night the captain was back, but somebody else was there with him. Something formless, like a hovering black ink cloud.

‚ÄúStrange.. a dream ghost? Why did you bring it with you?‚Äù The voice sounded like a sweet whisper in his ears.

‚Äú A dream ghost? What do you mean?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not a real ghost, it‚Äôs a ghost you dreamt up, like a tune that gets stuck in your head and you can shake it. You manifested him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I get rid of it?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúIf you had been anybody else, I would simply wave it away, but not you. You have to face it, face why you made it, and it will fade away. Now sleep. I will keep him locked away for your vacation. But when you know why, then face him, and you will dissolve him.‚Äù

Adam looked at the thing, but all he saw was a sleeping Evelyn as he had woken up. He kissed her and got up. Then he got dressed and walked outside into the cool night.

‚ÄúStill not able to sleep?‚Äù Roks said, and he looked at the next Bungalow where Roks was sitting on the porch with a beer.

‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt know why. Anyway, let's not talk about that now. I‚Äôm here to relax.‚Äù He walked over, and Roks offered him a beer.

‚ÄúI can agree to that. Besides, I was wondering when we could go fishing again? Just the guys.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the guys?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, look, I love my wife, but you know sometimes I need to be able to tell bad jokes and drink some beers with my buddies. Hell, I‚Äôm starting to enjoy that assassin, too. You sure as hell need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, maybe I do,‚Äù Adam replied as he took a sip and looked up at the two full moons.

‚ÄúHmm, back home, they thought the full moon brought out the werewolves.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won't start howling,‚Äù Roks said and grinned.

‚ÄúI hope not, you will wake the twins!‚Äù Adam replied and grinned.

They prescribed me valacyclovir and after 3-5 months of taking it and no results of it working I went back, to which they prescribed me famcyclovir. That also had no effects, so after doing some research I went to get another opinion at a dermatology location to which they told me they didnt think it was cold sores and that it was either fordyce spots or an allergic reaction. The dermatologist prescribed me triamcinolone acetonide to apply in moderation (only when bumps are present like im the attached) and that it shouldnt be applied excessively (I shouldnt be using the application every day). It works, which is great, but the problem is I find myself applying it almost as if im using it as chapstick replacement (excessively).

I'm trying to really give benefit of the doubt because I feel like I'm being lied to. This man says he wants a serious, for the long haul relationship with me, but his actions seem to say otherwise. 

The first date was a coffee and walk date where he was repeatedly very handsy. He otherwise seemed very kind though, so i agreed to go out again. He only seems to want to plan things at his house, which makes me uncomfortable given how pushy he was on the first date.

 I said it would make me happy if we could plan a date out and he kind of just skirted around what I said. I then said I only wanted to meet if it was for a date out in public and he chose to just not see me instead of taking me out. 

He sent a text message later that rubbed me the wrong way: ""I'm sorry we couldn't enjoy a relaxing evening together."" Something about it just irritated me a bit. Like we could have hung out if we went out on an actual date. I didn't even want anything fancy. 

I pointed out that his actions don't seem to line up with what he is saying he wants, and he is saying I'm being negative, my thinking isn't correct, and is just generally making it a me problem.

 I'm sorry if this post sounds stupid.  I'm not a man, so I'm asking for your advice. Is there some genuine reason he would be acting this way that I'm not thinking of? Am I overreacting? Am I being very negative? This is just really bothering me. ",2,1752243844.0,AskMenRelationships,1,1.0,False

From that day to this day (almost two weeks) She didn't replied.

I also sent her a courtesy message asking if everything is all right. Even that was not answered

She is still active on Insta. Sees my story and uploads her.

1lx84gr,https://i.redd.it/4ol6rdfr79cf1.png,Pink Salt and Ice Weight Loss: Trendy Tactic or Just Cold Hype?,"So I've been seeing this **Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss** trend everywhere lately, and honestly? I was skeptical. Like, really skeptical. Another internet fad that sounds too good to be true, right? But after doing some digging and actually trying it myself, I figured I'd share what I learned with you all.

**What's the deal with this method?**

The whole **Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss** thing isn't just about throwing some fancy salt on ice cubes and calling it a day. It's actually rooted in some interesting science about thermogenesis and mineral absorption. Basically, your body has to work harder to process cold temperatures, which can boost your metabolism temporarily.

üëâ *Want the full breakdown on how this actually works? I found this really detailed explanation that covers all the science behind it.*

**Why the quality of your salt matters more than you think**

Here's where most people mess up - they grab any pink salt from the grocery store and wonder why they're not seeing results. Not all pink salts are created equal, and I learned this the hard way.

Real Himalayan pink salt contains over 80 trace minerals that your body actually needs. The cheap stuff? It's often just regular salt with added coloring. *Trust me, I wasted money on the knockoff version first.*

When you're doing the **Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss** method, you want salt that's been minimally processed. Look for salt that's actually from the Himalayan region - it should have natural color variations and feel slightly coarse between your fingers.

**The texture secret that changes everything**

Without giving away all the steps, here's something crucial: the size of your ice matters way more than you'd think. I started with regular ice cubes and barely felt anything. Then I switched to crushed ice, and wow - completely different experience.

The increased surface area means better contact with the salt, which affects how quickly your body responds to the temperature change. It's like the difference between a gentle cool breeze and actually feeling refreshed.

**A bit of history that surprised me**

So apparently, using salt and cold therapy isn't new at all. I went down a rabbit hole reading about how ancient cultures used cold mountain salt springs for healing. The Romans had their cold salt baths, and traditional medicine in Tibet has used pink salt with cold therapy for centuries.

It's kind of wild that we're ""discovering"" something that people have been doing for thousands of years. Makes you wonder what other old wisdom we've forgotten about, you know?

**My personal experience with Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss**

I'll be honest - I started this more out of curiosity than any real expectation. I've tried enough ""miracle"" weight loss things to know better. But after about two weeks of consistent use, I noticed something interesting.

It wasn't dramatic weight loss or anything like that. But I felt more energized in the mornings, and my usual afternoon crash didn't hit as hard. My friend who tried it with me said she noticed her digestion improved too.

*Could it be placebo effect? Maybe.* But for something that costs less than a fancy coffee and takes five minutes, I figured why not keep going?

**The realistic expectations talk**

Look, I need to be clear about something - **Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss** isn't going to magically melt away 20 pounds. Anyone telling you that is selling something. What it might do is give your metabolism a gentle nudge and help with water retention.

The real benefit I've noticed is that it's become part of a morning routine that makes me more mindful about what I eat the rest of the day. Sometimes that's more valuable than any direct weight loss effect.

**What I wish I'd known starting out**

If you're thinking about trying this, start small. I jumped in too enthusiastically the first day and felt pretty uncomfortable. Your body needs time to adjust to the temperature shock.

Also, timing matters. I get the best results doing this first thing in the morning, but I know people who prefer it before workouts. Experiment and see what works for your schedule.

The **Pink Salt And Ice Weight Loss** method isn't for everyone - if you have circulation issues or are sensitive to cold, definitely check with your doctor first.

Have any of you tried this or something similar? I'm curious if anyone else has noticed the energy boost I mentioned. And if you've found any variations that work better, I'd love to hear about them. Sometimes the best tips come from the comments section, right?

I‚Äôve booked airfares to and from Buffalo from LGA for the three-day period from September 6th through 8th.  I‚Äôve also booked my ‚ÄúTailgate Only Pass‚Äù with Bmore Around Town, so I‚Äôm pretty much set for game day beginning in the late afternoon.

Pending on my planning list are the following:

* Finding a decent and/or suitable hotel based on downtown location and my non-football interests.

* Non-football activities, including walking, during the daytime 

* Buying a solo ticket 

**Hotel**

Even looking this far in advance, hotels are understandably pricey, but reasonably within my budget.  What's most important is location.  It seems that most of the hotels for attending Highland Park stadium are downtown Buffalo, approximately 8 miles from the stadium.  I assume I can take a Lyft to the stadium (or tailgate event), and it's likely that the nicer hotels will be hosting out-of-towners for the game.  Of course, since I'll be attending the tailgate party (location is currently TBA), access to the stadium will be straightforward (I've previously attended a Bmore Around Town tailgate only pass in Glendale, AZ for a Cardinals' game).

What are some downtown hotel options close to walkable downtown Buffalo for cafes, restaurants, maybe local parks, sites to see, etc.?  I'm open to boutique hotels, or within the Hilton Honors domain.

**Non-football activities**

Seeking casual coffee joints, places to walk, sites to see, etc. during the morning and daytime.  I'm arriving Saturday night, so I'll have Sunday morning before the tailgate, and since I'm planning to leave Monday night, my Monday during the day is open for leisure.  Seeking suggestions based on my low-key on-foot interests.

**Ticket**

I attend professional sporting events often, and when buying a single ticket, StubHub, even on game day, has never been a problem (access-wise).

Final question:

What type of weather may I expect for early September, and during the Sunday night game, to prepared to dress appropriately.",4,1752243561.0,buffalobills,2,0.83,False

1lx83vt,https://v.redd.it/moti8z9k79cf1,Colorism post: ‚ÄúDark Girls‚Äù Documentary,"Watched a documentary on youtube that happens to be free. I‚Äôll be linking it in the comments. I genuinely thought it was pretty good for being free. It was released in 2009 on youtube meaning it was made before social media was widespread like how it is today.

We know colorism is intersectional to racism and while the two aren‚Äôt the same thing, one can be dark without being Black. And the opposite is also true.

Colorism affects everyone in society because it devalues you as a human being. From running to catch a bus that won‚Äôt stop for you, to buying a coffee and being given a cold attitude for no reason. Any time you apply for a rental property, a mortgage to buy a property once people see what you look like the attitude changes and opportunities slip through your hands. Same goes for looking for a job, being graded academically, when dating, some men and women will automatically filter you out beyond a certain skin colour.

All these things essentially limit how much of society you can access and benefit off of and without hard work, creativity, charisma, and intelligence you are in a state of constant deficit or diminished returns. This compounds over years and decades resulting in having an essentially a lower lifestyle/standard of living than people you grew up with from different backgrounds and lighter complexions. 

As you can imagine this is extremely damaging psychologically because people will act like it doesn‚Äôt exist, and blame you for your failures and credit their efforts for their own successes. This can also lead to this like paranoia, depression, extreme stress, exhaustion, burnout and feelings of hopelessness and suicidality. 

The point of this post is to bring more attention to the very real and tangible effects of colorism and how it inescapably affects Black peoples lives in every conceivable dimension.

I think it‚Äôs worth trying to share idea‚Äôs of things that can be down to help our brothers and sisters out who are facing very unfair odds on a daily basis. As well as share stories of where either you faced colorism or contributed to it. 

Most of us learn from a young age people with darker skin are less than even without it explicitly being taught to us, and at a certain point we realize we have to essentially unbrainwash ourselves. Some of us will go to the lengths of trying to over correct for ourselves and the nature of society. Which is a sign of healing. The only thing that would be better is if from the very beginning we saw equal value in people of darker complexion.",2,1752243544.0,blackmen,13,0.63,False

I was about to fall back to sleep for that extra hour and 45 minutes of sleep before my alarm would go off, but then I remembered I forgot to roll up the windows on my car. 

I sprang right out of bed, I got my shoes on, and made the run outside to quickly roll my driver side window up. 

Right as I got the window rolled up, and I got back inside, the rain started coming down real heavy. I saved myself from a wet seat, and a wet behind, thankfully! 

But yea once I remembered I had a window down on my car, that made me spring out of bed real quick. Unfortunately I was too worked up by that point to even think about going back to sleep, so I just went ahead and made some coffee.

Really sweet and nice people, pays rent on time and cleans the kitchen up after themselves. 

I got a tradie in a few weeks ago to fix something in the roof so had to get access to their room with permission.

I didn‚Äôt say anything, but they have their air fryer up there now and I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll just be dangerous and a fire hazard also the smell it‚Äôll be making in the carpet and curtains as there is no ventilation apart from the windows. 

Since one of them is from Iran I‚Äôm trying to respect the culture of how he grew up and not try to upset him but the fryer just crossed the line and I do wanna say something, how would I go about this or am I not being a good host? or being controlling?
