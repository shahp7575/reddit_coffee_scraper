There's that one coworker (37F) I really like, and also find attractive. we have some mutual projects we work on together, having coffee breaks with each other, eating lunch etc. The two of us are the youngest employees in this company, all the other guys are 55 and above, so we have things in common.

Anyway, couple of days I complimented her about her cloths and we had a chat about that. We had this kind of conversations in the past so it wasn't weird.

The day after she came with a similar shirt, but with the buttons all the way down between her breasts. I could easily see her bra and the rest. Damn. It didn't look provocative, but quite obvious. I know it was not a mistake, because I saw her fixing her shirt but left the buttons open. This kind of style is so out of her character.

I'm wondering if me paying attention to her cloths motivated her to test my reaction. Lately we became closer as friends, and she's showing more appreciation to me. She broke up with her husband like 6 months ago, and it all makes me thinking if she trying to get my attention now?

TLDR: Complimented my coworker about cloths, and the next day changed her outfit to be very revealing. Wonder if there's a connection between the two.",1,1760997795.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1obv7ov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obv7ov,Pelican Case for Robot and Grinder,"Went on a long weekend trip recently, but didn’t want to compromise on my coffee experience, so I managed to fit most of the essentials in a Pelican case. Used Blender to test different case dimensions and settled on the Pelican 1520 case.

The whole thing ended up being quite heavy but I was very satisfied having the premium feel of the robot while I was on vacation. Definitely overkill for a weekend trip, but seems like it would be perfect for longer ones.

Unfortunately the Cafelat sticker finally fell off during travel after clinging on for dear life for almost a year. Rest in peace.

1obuyvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1obuyvt/coffee_sugar_and_lies/,"Coffee, Sugar, and Lies","I don’t really know where it started, maybe the cruise, maybe before that. For 8 years my girlfriend and I, being the high school sweethearts we are,  have always had a great relationship. Hell, I was planning to propose once I finished grad school, but recently everything changed. 

I guess she was never really the same after her cruise, but I can't say for certain. Honestly I can’t even say for certain anything has changed, I feel like I am losing my mind. A few weeks ago my girlfriend, let's call her Alice, went on a dream vacation with some of her childhood friends. One of them got engaged and used the opportunity to have their dream cruise across the Caribbean. It was a 10 day cruise and I thought everything went great, but when Alice came home … I don’t know, things were just different. 

She texted me whenever the ship actually had a signal, just the little things to know she was thinking of me: texts that essentially boiled down to two things, that she loved and missed me, and that she can’t wait to finally shower in her shower.

Another piece of context, we have two showers in the apartment as it used to be a duplex. While we sleep and get ready in the master bedroom, Alice has all but taken over the spare bedroom’s bathroom as her own private paradise. 

With all of that said, I guess I should start from when she got home. About 3 weeks ago Alice came home unexpectedly. The cruise was supposed to end the following day, so I was shocked when she walked in the door. 

She gave me her radiant smile and after the initial shock of her random return, I felt my heart swell and push aside the anxieties. Looking back now, I swear that smile never touched her eyes, almost like she was approximating her own smile. 

“W .. What are you doing home?!” I stammered as I ran up and wrapped her in a tight embrace. 
“I guess we caught the current or something on our way back, we docked this morning” she offered with that steady, forced(?) smile. 

I wanted to ask why she didn’t call or have me pick her up from the airport, but the questions were drowned out by the roar of happiness I felt at seeing her after these 9 days. We spent the next hour or so in our room recounting her travels and all the drama that ensued. Besides the surface-level issues, it actually seemed like it was a fun trip. One of the last stories she told involved some drunk lady spilling her drink on Alice. 

I made some comment along the lines of “Well I know you’ve been craving your shower, at least you'll be able to fully get that stink off.” She paused, just for a heartbeat, when I mentioned showering, almost like she didn’t know what I meant. Then she smiled and said I was “so right” and then got up and proceeded to walk into our, not her, bathroom and begin showering. 

It may have been nothing, but it seemed like she genuinely didn’t even consider her own shower that she loved so much. I let it go and attributed it to jet-lag, not wanting to ruin the night, but the next few times she showered, it was in this same way. A few days after her return I finally asked if she had given up on her private paradise, and she seemed to have no idea what I was referring to saying she always bounced between both showers. 

However, the next time I noticed her showering, and every time after that, it came from “her” shower. Weird little inconsistencies like this have been more and more frequent lately. Nothing major, like forgetting names or meaningful memories, but many, many small issues. 

Take for example the fact that for as long as we have been together she has always taken her coffee with 1 sugar and 2 creams, and now all of a sudden she’s ordering it with 3 sugar and no cream. Maybe she started this on the cruise and I am overreacting, but these issues continue to compound. She’s always been one of the deranged few who wears socks to sleep, in fact we have a few inside jokes related to this, and now I am caressed by her cold, bare feet at night. 

It all came to a head earlier tonight when we went out for our anniversary dinner. She had wanted to plan the night and have it be a fun surprise for me. We went to a local place with a lot of meaning, it was where we had our first date. Despite all my anxieties around the strangeness, I was excited, not only because she actually remembered something real to us, but also because I desperately wanted the night to go well. 

Dinner was off to a great start, we enjoyed our bread and oil and talked about our plans for the weekend. I remember taking the time to just look and stare at her overt beauty, though our situation may have felt weird since the cruise, she was just as beautiful as ever. 

When she ordered a regular coke, my stomach churned with the fury of a storm made by Poseidon himself. Instantly, my mood soured and in that moment I was sure whatever was sitting across from me was not my girlfriend. In the last 8 years she has only ever ordered diet soda, and with this realization I began to panic. 

The past 3 weeks of oddities boiled up and manifested as sweat rolling waves down my face. Alice noticed something was off and offered to head back early, I agreed and made up some lie about moldy bread making me ill. 

The ride back was excruciating, she kept playing songs I knew she hated or had never heard of. She started asking about our friend Alex who we had not seen in a few months, mistakenly referring to him as her, as if she was just taking a guess based on the name. I had to sit there and pretend it was all fine, all the while I was positive I was sitting next to an impostor. I tried to keep my eyes forward, but I kept snatching glances at her. With each peek I felt the disguise melt more and more. 

She was trying to make small talk but her words sounded hollow, I heard them for what they were now. I got away with providing half-answers and blaming my illness, I just couldn't stand to look at her anymore. Her skin looked … tighter somehow, like the shape underneath wasn’t exactly right. I blinked hard forcefully causing the thought to pass. 

I could feel myself spiraling and somehow convinced myself that I was blowing things way out of proportion and that it was all just my misunderstanding. If I could just get home and sleep it off I’d feel normal again and I could convince myself that Alice was fine and so was I. 

When we got back to the apartment I followed her up the steps to our floor, and watched her begin unlocking the door. We have lived together in this apartment for 5 years, and during that entire time she always had trouble with unlocking the door. I found it so adorable and endearing, somehow she always not only struggled to get the key in the lock, but would then turn the key the wrong way first, every single time. 

I watched as she expertly slid the key into the lock and unlocked the door on the first turn, swinging the door inward. The hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up like the hackles of a wolf recognizing a predator approached. I could see the uncanniness in her eyes as they focused onto my fear. I didn’t even let her finish the question she had begun to ask, I turned and bolted out of the building. 

I ran until my legs cried out in pain and my lungs burned with every breath, each time I slowed down, all I could picture was that damn forced smile and stretched skin, then I’d take off spriting again. I don't know how long or how far I ran but I’m sitting now typing this on an unfamiliar bench in a dark park. My phone is full of messages from Alice feigning concern and asking what happened, but I will not be tricked again, no matter how well this creature can play Alice, it is not good enough to trick me.

1obuvca,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1obuvca/how_do_i_move_on/,How do I move on?,"I’ve never posted on here before but I really need to get it off my chest and maybe get some advice.

I’m a 32yr old (m) and lately I’ve been struggling with everything that’s happened in my past. I think it’s finally time to deal with it all, but honestly, I don’t even know where to start.

When I was 9, my mum — who was my best friend — sadly passed away in a pretty traumatic way and I was the one who found her, and if I’m honestly it’s left me messed up since. After the fall out I was put into care and basically abandoned by my family. Eventually I ended up living with my dad, who had serious problems. Mainly with drunk and substances. 

He was / is a terrible dad, although I actually feel bad for him now, he would often beat me and my older brother as children and my brother would take his anger out on me too. I was pretty much at the bottom of the food chain and used to barricade myself in my room a lot. Although no one even noticed. 

By 12yr old I was just a shell of who I used to be. I barely went outside, and all the stress had a huge impact on me, I ended up having an odd trauma response and I woke up one day covered in plague psoriasis head to toe. I then went into hospital for nearly a year, doing light therapy and all sorts of medications and coal tar treatment. Walking around bandaged up like a mummy. No one came to visit me, not even on my birthday, but the nurses made me feel special. As sad as it is to say that time in hospital was one actually great. Nice people. Nice food. It wasn’t lonely as I had people coming and going out the ward all the time. Although it’s kind of sad that one of childhood highlights is being hospitalised…

When I got out I didn’t really know who I was anymore. I remember being a happy kid before everything happened but after all that, it felt like a piece of me was missing. I started drinking and doing all sorts to numb it all tbh smoking. By 15, I even tried doing what my mum did but thankfully i failed. I realised after that no one was coming to save me. I turned into someone else, I became so driven after that. 

It took years but I eventually managed to turn my life around. I finished college and university, met an amazing woman, got married, and now we have two incredible kids. I feel like I finally have the life I deserved. I’ve won but why don’t I feel like it. I’ve strived for everything I have, but I’m still empty. The victory I longed for have arrived but it’s not as I expected. 

Id even say that deep down, I still feel different from everyone else. I carry a lot of bitterness about how people let me down, and it’s hard to shake all that off tbh. 
What hurts even more is when I try to reconnect with my family from back then. They often act like I’m the problem or that my past is too much to deal with or I’m the problem for bringing it all up. They can’t acknowledge what happened and what I’ve achieved you know. Sometimes I just wanted someone to say well done. People with a family will never understand how lucky they are, those random texts they get like “how are you” or their mum or dad asking how their day is…I just wanted that. Those random catch ups over a coffee. It was all taken away. 

I know it sounds bitter maybe I am but I can’t help feeling that way. It eats me up. 
Whenever I bring this up to family, they just say, “That’s life,” and expect me to move on like nothing happened. But I can’t. I don’t want my trauma to define me, but it feels like it’s become part of who I am and I hate that. I feel like that young me deserved better.

I’ve tried therapy, but it hasn’t really helped. I want to let it go I really do, but I just don’t know how or who I even am underneath all this. How do you move on from something that shaped every part of who you are?

Thanks for reading, and honestly, any comments or advice would mean a lot.

I don't even like Marcus, but I think she was so selective with her sympathy, knowing that it made more sense to ask Elsa if she wanted a cup of tea. 

I feel bad calling her out, but she's one of those girls that would give your evils for sitting in front of them on a bus. You're not enjoying it in there? Leave! It's up to you.  

Anyone can see that Elsa is very sensitive due to her past, but I hate this Love Island way of walking of and not advocating for yourself when your man doesn't ""treat you like a queen."" I don't know maybe I've just drunk a lot of coffee because I wouldn't have handled it in there when I was 18 or 22. 

I know that Marcus is picking up on the fact that BB production definitely favours certain housemates when it comes to asking them to the confessionals to do interviews, but this is very reality tv 101. Plant a seed in someone's head that they aren't doing enough and then leave them out of the list of housemates called to the diary room. Classic tactic to wind people up and cause drama.

I know it's really tough for Elsa, but why was no one seeing it from Marcus's side as well. As I say, I'm not a fan, but Caroline saying he screamed at her (he didn't I don't think?), and young men have a lot of pressure on them these days to be seen and to not break down under tough circumstances. 

The difference in how male and female reactions and optics are viewed are still very different and if you want an idea about why there's a crisis in male mental health (as well as female mental health), then I think that demonstrates it. 

I think I just lack sympathy for British girls when they walk off and curl up and expect to be petted. It's entitled to me. She obviously feels more towards him and than he does for her, and it's like, just calm down.",0,1760996178.0,bigbrotheruk,2,0.48,False

1obu6l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1obu6l4/aio_for_wanting_to_get_revenge_on_my_friend/,AIO for Wanting to Get Revenge on My Friend?,"I (23F) had a close friend in uni, let's call her Leah (22F). We were in the same major and instantly clicked over our shared interest in pop culture, which was rare in our STEM-focused university in Southeast Asia. Early on, we realized our life views and morals didn't align well. She's a self-proclaimed 'chill girl' who's into niche, male-coded hobbies and easily befriended everyone, from seniors to classmates. She's also conventionally pretty and a mediocre dancer who's always on stage, so men were constantly hitting on her; something she never stopped talking about.

On the other hand, I'm a plus-size bisexual woman (LGBTQIA+ is still very taboo here). While women found me pretty, men generally did not. I'm very vocal about my leftist political ideologies and feminism, whereas Leah was neutral about everything. I also came to this uni to be with my long-distance boyfriend, Aaron (24M), so everyone knew I was taken and I wasn't approached much. I have a hard time trusting and befriending people, but I was always nice to them.

We had many surface-level female friends, but Leah and I managed to maintain our friendship for almost two years. I love to hype up my friends and used to hype Leah up whenever I could. However, I'm low-maintenance and don't have much social energy, so I often skipped campus events. Leah, who lived on-campus, attended every single one. She'd often tell me how much I was ""missing out"" and how she was friends with everyone there. I didn't care much, as those events wore me down and the nightly commute was hard, but I still tried to attend when I could.

After our second semester, we no longer shared the same schedule, but we still made an effort to spend time together.

My bf (let's call him Aaron) is like my best friend as we were childhood sweethearts and have almost identical views on everything. He is very upbeat, unlike me, and has friends almost everywhere. Aaron had no siblings and grew up as an only child, so however he behaved was a model for me. Leah is also an only child and seemed unproblematic at first. She had quote-unquote a perfect family bonding with no drama, whereas me and Aaron had quite a few issues in our families while growing up. Since both Aaron and Leah are only children and very friendly, I wanted them to get along. I started inviting Leah to our hangouts, and it was fun.

In my third semester, Aaron got seriously injured and needed surgery, forcing him to take two semesters off. He had to move back to his city for care, and we were both devastated. While in uni, I made a new friend, (21F) Sage. She is so sweet to me and both of us had the same schedule and same route home. We also had similar interests and identical sentiments on social issue. It was really easy to be her friend, even though we had met for only a few days. She understood me, she understood my situations, and made it very easy for me to open up to her. At the same time, I still used to hang out with Leah in her dorm. Up to this point, everything was fine between me and Leah.

In my fourth semester, I started taking prescribed Ozempic for my PCOS and began losing weight. Leah was supportive, keeping tabs on my health.

But then, a series of incidents changed our entire dynamic.

1. Being inappropriate to me: Leah started making moves on me, like caressing my thighs and neck, getting close to my face as if to kiss me, and asking if I ""felt anything."" She played it off as a ""you make me question my sexuality"" joke. As a childhood sexual abuse survivor, I hate sudden touch from anyone but my immediate family or Aaron. . My close friends were allowed to hug me or hold my hand but nothing more than that. I made it very clear to her that I don't like these kinds of touches; she said she understood but went back to doing that anyway (she is strictly straight and had no prior dating experience, but she has only shown interest in men). It took her a whole month of continuing that joke before stopping it altogether.

2. Commenting on my singing: When we attended a concert on our campus, she said that ""you are singing off key"" or ""your voice is worse than so and so"" whenever I used to sing out loud to the songs at the concert. (I had 10 years of classical music training but severe stage fright and anxiety, so I can't perform anywhere in front of an audience. She is aware of my situation)

3. Commenting on my family dynamic: I invited Leah and her roommate, Phoebe (also in our uni, same batch but different department), to my home. Phoebe sided with my mom as she ‘jokingly’ berated me about an embarrassing childhood incident and my rebellious teen phase, I was very uncomfortable with it. Phoebe was doing this to butter up my mom and get permission for me to go on an overnight trip with them. I asked Leah to talk to Phoebe. Instead Leah told Phoebe that my parents had a ""messed-up bonding,"" my dad wasn't ""that serious"" in the marriage, and that this made me ""sensitive"" and ""fucked up my relationship with my mother."" (My mother is controlling and overbearing, which I have issues with, but this was a massive overstep and misrepresentation).

4.  Leah's birthday: As Leah was the only child to her parents and they made a big deal over her birthday, being away from home on her birthday made her sad. So, to cheer her up, I baked a cake and surprised her in her dorm. She was very happy about it and we took a few pictures together. Later when we went out for eating, she started ranting about how Phoebe did not make any effort to do something on her birthday and how she expected so much from her but ended up getting disappointed. The rant went on throughout the whole time we were eating. (Later, when I asked Phoebe about it, she said Leah had never once wished her a happy birthday in two years of being roommates. That's why Phoebe did not even bother to do something.)



5.  Being insensitive: Whenever I was sad over my family issues, Leah used to ask me about the situations. Upon explaining, she always sided with my mother being abusive, said 'how much she relates to my mother's emotional outbursts,' or brought up how her parents love her so much and she is so pampered in her house that she never had to experience any of that.



6. Aaron:  I love it when my loved ones get along, and all my friends are friendly with Aaron. Initially, I was the one who invited him to join Leah and me for shopping or cafe trips. Eventually, Leah started inviting him herself.

When Aaron had to move back home for his surgery, I was upset and lost without his daily support. During this time, Leah and I were talking about his health when she said, ""Thank God Aaron is not in uni. You were always with him and now we get to spend more time with each other without him."" When I asked, ""What do you mean? Do you hate him being around?"" she replied, ""No, I like his company, but now I have all of your time.""

Aaron has a small cooking TikTok and is known in our social circle as ""the guy who cooks."" About a month post-surgery, he posted a photo of a homemade pizza on his Instagram story. Leah replied at 2 AM with, ""Oh, you made it?"" Aaron was on the phone with me and wanted to be snarky, but I asked him to be nice. He kept his replies short, but she continued, asking when he would cook for her and how she was craving pizza. He eventually ignored her.

After he healed and returned to uni, we all attended a concert. While Aaron and I were holding each other and vibing to the music, Leah suddenly reached out and tried to squeeze his cheeks, saying, ""Your cheeks must be so soft."" Aaron immediately pushed her hand away and moved behind me. I was too shocked to say anything and pretended it didn't happen. Later, Aaron was furious that I hadn't confronted her.

Around this time, a big religious festival was coming up. Leah needed to go shopping, and since she always whined that I never shopped with her (I usually go with my sister, Eve), I offered to accompany her. To my surprise, Leah herself invited Aaron, insisting his presence would mean ""more time in the evening"" and be a ""safer option."" Aaron felt weird about the invitation and didn't want to go. When I told Leah he was too busy, she postponed the plan until the last possible minute. He ultimately did not join us.

A few days later, while Aaron and I were sitting together, Leah joined us. Out of the blue, she mentioned feeling ""jealous"" and getting ""heartburn"" from seeing us be physically affectionate—even though she had previously insisted we didn't need to be formal around her. Aaron retorted, ""Well then brace yourself to death.""

Later that day, we were all out for coffee with another friend. We brought up a hilarious video Aaron had posted with his friends three years ago. Leah immediately said, ""Oh! I saw that video."" We were dumbfounded; Aaron is chronically online, and that video was so old she would have had to scroll through years of his profile to find it. It was clear she had been stalking him extensively.

During another festival, while Sage was taking photos of me in my outfit, Leah insisted on taking them instead; and all her pictures came out badly. As Sage and I resumed taking photos, Leah randomly commented on how ""lonely and sad"" Aaron looked and suggested he should go and find his friends. Aaron was perfectly fine and insisted on staying with me. She then asked me to make him take pictures of her, and he refused.

Leah always waves to Aaron before she acknowledges me, which makes him very uncomfortable. According to Phoebe, she even shows our couple photos to her dorm friends, gushing about how Aaron is a ""green flag"" and how ""everyone deserves a man like him.""

Eventually, Aaron had enough and unfollowed Leah on all social media. Despite this, whenever she saw us together, she would approach him directly and try to start a conversation. He would shut her down with short replies or silence. She then began texting him, which he also ignored. Finally, she came to me and asked why he had removed her, demanding to know, ""What did you say to him for this to happen?"" I told her I had no idea and that I would ask him about it.

7.  Nahar: For context, Nahar was everything Leah ever wanted to be. She has a full scholarship, is friendlier and to be honest, prettier than Leah. She's in a stable long-distance relationship, has high-paying part-time jobs, is the leader of our university dance crew, and is the youngest member of the university research society.

Leah is friendly to Nahar's face, especially when they practiced together for festival performances, but she would consistently leave me out during those times. In contrast, Nahar has always included me; she's been a friend since the first semester when others in our department were hostile toward her.

Behind her back, Leah constantly accused Nahar of sabotage. In one instance, she claimed Nahar lost her tickets—tickets that Leah herself had put into Nahar's bag. When Nahar offered her own ticket, Leah refused it. She would also frequently claim Nahar ""isn't as friendly as she seems."" Leah often made random, pointed comments about Nahar's high-end makeup and family wealth. She also had a weird fixation on Nahar's boyfriend, going on and on about how ""lucky"" Nahar was and all the gifts he bought her. Then, in almost the same breath, she would turn to me and say, ""You and Aaron should tone down the PDA a little bit; some of my friends are not comfortable with that."" But when I asked her to name a single person who had said that, she could never give me a definitive answer.

8.  Not respecting my time:  When Leah and I finally went shopping, she made me wait on the street for 45-60 minutes while she was only a five-minute walk away. This was particularly difficult for me as I was fasting that day and couldn't drink water, which she knew. I didn't feel comfortable barging into her room, and when she finally arrived, she didn't apologize.

It was a weekend and there was this festival rush. We ran into a guy Leah had previously liked but now found sleazy. She complained about how uncomfortable he made her, yet she still went out of her way to talk to him. I suggested she buy henna cones, a staple item for this occasion, but she refused, claiming she had no one to apply it on her.

We then spent hours navigating the crowded mall, searching every clothing store for her dress. She didn't like anything, and the one dress she did like was over her budget. She then started yelling at me, blaming me for planning the trip too late and accusing me of being the reason she couldn't find a dress. (The original day we had planned was the day after a close family friend's sudden death and his funeral, and I was in no mental state to go shopping).

We continued searching until it was time for me to break my fast. She hadn't paid for our commute as promised, and now claimed she had no money for my food because she needed it for shopping. I decided to pay for my own meal, but when I wanted to choose what to eat, she became upset. She insisted we order the same meal so she wouldn't feel lonely, even though I disliked what she wanted. She proceeded to order a $20 meal, while I had a $5 one—and she couldn't even finish hers.

After buying a few other items, we headed for the exit. I tried to guide us out without another encounter with the sleazy guy, but she deliberately went out of her way to find him. When he insisted on buying her henna, she accepted.

On the way home, our routes diverged halfway. When she told me to pay for half of the remaining fare, which I refused. I explained that I needed the money to take a taxi, as I felt unsafe taking the bus alone after 9 PM. She whinned at me for being ""snobby"" and told me to take the bus instead. I stood my ground and didn't give her the money.

9.  Money issues: For context, I do a small part-time job to get money for my daily spendings as my family is not that solvent and paying for the tuition fee is very burdening to them. On the other hand, Leah is completely dependent on her parents financially, and they send her a pretty good amount of money every week for her to spend on whatever she wants. Despite this, Leah would often ask me randomly for $5-$10 to pay for her meals and promised to pay me back whenever she could (which never happened). She never asked if I needed that money or not (I am very cautious about my daily spending and barely spend anything outside my budget). This piled up pretty quickly and now she owes me $125 over the past 2 years.

10. Phoebe: Last semester, I ran into Phoebe on campus and we decided to catch up. When I asked about a hangout that never happened( Leah had blamed it on Phoebe ""ditching"" her)Phoebe was so done with it and she dropped her two cents on Leah. She then told me how horribly Leah had treated her, revealing that she left the dorm partly to get away from her. Phoebe said she was treated ""like a fucking slave,"" and when Leah couldn't use her anymore, she tried to infiltrate Phoebe's friend group. With this, both of us realized how horrible Leah was and how we were not the only sufferers of her action.

A few days after our conversation, they had a huge argument and Phoebe blocked Leah on WhatsApp. Leah was visibly upset for days. She then began a campaign to prove she was having a great time without Phoebe, constantly posting stories of herself out with others.

A week later, Leah asked me to confront Phoebe on her behalf and find out why she had been cut off. Since I already knew the truth, I asked Phoebe how to proceed. She advised me to go back to Leah and demand an explanation for her own behavior. When I did this, Leah was completely nonchalant. She dismissed every one of Phoebe's concerns, saying it ""wasn't that big of a deal"" and defensively adding that ""Phoebe never even brought this up to her."".

11. Friend group issues: Last semester, my sister Eve joined our university by getting a scholarship here. Me, Aaron, and Sage were so happy, as Eve got along wonderfully with everyone. We also started hanging out more with Sara and Brie, who were initially Aaron's friends, as our schedules aligned. We'd often share meals between classes. Our group has similar interests, and I still love spending time with them. Leah hated this new dynamic because I started spending less time with her. She tried sitting with us a few times, but no one gave her special attention. Aaron was actively avoiding her, and both Eve and Sage disliked how she treated me. Naturally, she felt left out and made sure everyone know that.. Despite this, I still made an effort to be nice to her and include her in outings with our mutual friends from the department.

12. Men: Leah was conventionally pretty, and she never lacked male attention. At first, I found it amusing to see my friend so desired. However, I soon realized she would actively flirt with these men and accept their favors, all while having no genuine interest in dating them. Ironically, she constantly asked me and Aaron to find her a boyfriend or set her up.The men she was genuinely attracted to were invariably already in relationships. She developed crushes on seniors, classmates, and even faculty members, gushing to me about them. While she would accept favors from the men who pursued her, she never reciprocated their feelings.I found this behavior utterly scummy. Her language about the taken men was particularly disgusting. She would say things like, ""I just want to eat him up,"" or, ""I wish he would leave his girlfriend so I could have a chance."" She consistently believed these men's partners were beneath her and that the men ""deserved better"" i.e, her.Furthermore, whenever she met someone new and I asked how it went, her recap was never about the person's character or their conversation. It was always about how the person had instantly liked her or wanted to date her.

After all these incident, I started to feel bitter about her. But I did not wanted to lose a friend as I have very few of them. On the other hand, she sometimes genuinely put some effort to include me or be around me; which I was very grateful of. When she and Phoebe had that fall out, she repeatedly said that 'Phoebe never brought up her issues to her, otherwise she could've done something about it.' Phoebe and I both had this belief that if we were to bring up our issues, she would have dismissed those and Phoebe didn't want to face that.. However, during this semester break with no contact, I felt incredibly peaceful. I confided in Nahar and other mutual friends about Leah's behavior, and they all had negative reactions, confirming I wasn't crazy. This semester, I avoided her to my best. On my birthday, she gave me a half-hearted wish at 11 PM, which was hilarious given how she makes a huge deal of her own.

Next few days, I saw her around campus again and it was a very awkward interaction which made me feel somewhat sad. Aaron and Sage helped me to avoid her completely and the whole process made me feel a little bit angry too. (I actually can ignore people like I never saw them all too well, but this scenario is not working). Remembering that Leah claimed to ""like confrontation,""on multiple occasions, I decided to talk to her. So I met her the next day and sat her down for the conversation. 

When I asked her about each of the incidents that happened to me, she was obviously very dismissive of them; saying 'she had no ill intentions' or i am the one who is making her 'the bad guy'.When I stood my ground, she said, ""So this happened a long time ago? Now do you want me to say sorry about it?""This got me so pissed. Regarding the incidents with Aaron, she said she realized it was awkward and did it ""subconsciously."" Then she dropped this bombshell: ""My behavior with Aaron is only a problem because Aaron is taken; if he was single, these wouldn't even be an issue."" She asked me if I thought she was a sl\*t, and I said I wouldn't slut-shame her over this. Then she again retorted that she didn't know how to apologize to Aaron. When I was visibly mad, she started saying sorry (it was more like 'sorry not sorry' typa shit) and I was like ""bruh stop apologizing and just fix yourself"". Then she said she also had some complaints against me and I told her to go ahead. Her complaints to me were:

1. Me, Aaron, Eve and Brie attended this one concert and I did not call Leah to join us. When I said Eve absolutely doesn't want to be around her and she dislikes her a lot, Leah got very offended saying 'why would Eve hate me? I never harmed her'. I said that not everyone has to like her, Leah wasn't ready to hear that. 

2. Leah claimed that after my friendship with Sage began, I stopped prioritizing her. When I asked why she felt that way, she said, ""You don't call me after Sage came into your life. I feel like Sage knows more about you than me and understands you better."" I replied that I had, in fact, called her and shared details of my life with her until just last month. I then asked how it was my fault that she didn't feel close to or understand me. She had no answer. 

She then brought up the fact that I had posted an Instagram story for Sage's birthday but hadn't done the same for hers. I reminded her that I had literally baked her an entire cake from scratch, pointing out that her focus on a social media post was missing the real-world effort I had made. I also mentioned that I hadn't baked Sage a cake (she is lactose-intolerant and lactose-free ingredients are hard to find here. But she does not know that.)

Her response was, ""See? That's how misunderstandings are created!""I explained that I'm not very active on social media, and that I show I care through tangible, in-person efforts. She dismissed this, stating, ""I don't care if you're a low-maintenance friend or not; I am a high-maintenance friend and I expect to be treated like one.""When I turned the tables and asked why she had done nothing for Phoebe's birthday, she simply shrugged it off with, ""We weren't close like that.""



3. She then complained that sitting with my friend group made her feel like an outsider and a ""second option"" in my life, insisting she had ""never been a second option to anybody."" I tried to clarify the source of her feelings. First, I asked if my own behavior had made her feel that way. She said no. I then asked if she felt the same sense of exclusion when we were with our mutual friends. Again, she said no. I frustratingly pointed out that it wasn't my fault she felt that way. Leah then reframed her argument, stating, ""If you hang out with those people on campus and you don't include me, you are not prioritizing me, and that makes me feel shitty."" I was so confused by her logic and  asked her, ""Why do you need to hang out with them?"".Her reply was, ""Because they are your friends, and I want to be a part of it."" I was so done with her to that point and didn't know how to deal with that. 



I explained how I didn't want to be strangers with her or avoid her but I wanted to be in a civil term with her, she did not like that. She doesn't care if we have way too many mutual friends, if I don't want her to bond or cherish her; she would rather be strangers with me. Then I said that she should change her behavior toward me and treat me well, maybe then things will get better between us.

Now I'm terrified. If we have a fallout, her popularity means people might believe whatever she says about me. Plus men in my department are very much like teapot and they spill shit without even checking twice, she knows how to utilize that very well. She has a history of bad-mouthing past friends. I have two years left, including my thesis, and I need a good reputation in my department. My initial, vengeful plan was to snitch to her parents about her financial habits and behavior around men, but I doubt it would even make a dent.

I feel so wronged and used. I gave my best to this friendship, and I don't want to just let her walk away after all the pain and frustration she's caused. AIO for wanting to fuck up her life a little bit in return?

1obu4zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1obu4zr/hello_fam/,Hello Fam,"This diagnosis of prediabetes was long overdue for me, but procrastination is the way of life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Both my parents had high blood pressure and high cholesterol and toward the end of my mom’s life she had renal failure. I’m sure at some point they likely had T2D but never took it seriously, we are an Asian household after all and rice is a staple at every meal. 

In August, I had my first ever adult bloodwork done in my life, yes first ever. Ignorance is bliss and I was living blissfully all these years with my head in the sand. My results came back: 


-a1c of 5.8
-insulin resistance 18.8 
-fasting glucose 98 

I was scared but not surprised because genetically I knew I was in for a real treat. In September I had a body composition test done as well to see a baseline of where I’m at. I’m a female 34yrs, 5’3, 195lbs, I did no exercising or strength training, just daily 10k+ steps 4 days a week. Once my body comp results came back, the physical therapist gave me some tips and tricks for muscle maintenance (as I have higher than average muscle mass for a female my age) and losing weight. He recommended 120g of protein daily, cutting carbs and focusing only on the complex ones like quinoa and sweet potatoes. Another interesting thing he saw in my body comp results was that my water weight was extremely low. He said I’m missing about 40lbs of weight just in water for my intracellular processes! I drink about 80oz of water daily (2 hydroflasks) but he suggested a pinch of sea salt and to up that 80 to 100oz! 

I urinate quite frequently and most often it’s always on the clear to transparent side rather than the pale yellow color, I’m wondering if that is because of the pre diabetes and if anyone else out there experiences that too?

Since September I have made some small changes but the biggest one has been making most of my meals at home, just changing that alone has helped me drop 8 lbs. Previously, I loved to indulge in dining out after a long hard day’s work (5 days a week approximately of dining out 🙈) and another change is trying to get myself to the gym just for some movement: stretching, jogging, mobility, swimming etc. I don’t push myself to do too much too fast because I know myself and know that I’ll get overwhelmed and revert back to save. I’m trying to pace myself by taking things slow, being more mindful, and more sustainable about what I eat and how much of it I’m eating. I still have my little sweet treats here and there but have drastically cut back on the sweetened coffees and soda which is my weakness. 

I eventually want to get a fitness ring and start tracking calories and macros once I’m in a place to commit to taking this lifestyle change more seriously. As far as CGM, I heard that it’s a good way to see what food works as everyone is different. Does anyone have any good recommendations for a CGM? It’ll likely be out of pocket because my insurance sucks, and ideally I would want to be able to contact the manufacturer if there are any issues. I think I read that Stelo has no customer support? So I probably won’t choose that one, but if anyone any tips, tricks, words of wisdom or criticism, I am open to hearing everyone out! ",1,1760995103.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

For context, ever since I was a child, I was your typical overachieving first born-daughter from asian family. At first our family's finance was good, but then around my middle school years, my father's business started to go down hill, but not immediate, just gradual. Then, when I went to HS, my parents forced me to go to a boarding school with really strict rules (semi-military) and high pressure academic settings (with 3 school standards: national, cambrige, and olympiad-level science course). At first I was rebelling, but soon found out there was nothing I could do about it and just accepted it and studied my ass off. However, the monthly tuition was kinda pricey compared to other public schools, because it was a specialized/academically-gifted boarding school. So, with my family's already deteriorating financial, they kinda struggle to pay the tuition on time each month. Then came my brother who is younger by 2 class below me. He was also wanted to go to the same school as me (i suspect it was an admiration of some sort) and so they enrolled my brother too. They struggled even more, but i safely graduated HS (with slight anxiety) and applied to a top engineering uni in my country. At first, it was tough for my parents, paying for my tuition fee in uni and monthly allowance + a student room, on top of also paying for my brother in that pricey HS. So, around the time my brother about to go to university, my parents confessed they didn't have enough for my tuition and allowance, and want me to search for solution. So, I went and thankfully got a partial scholarship which slashed 60% of tuition fee while also giving me 40% of my monthly allowance. Even with the scholarship, it was still hard for my parents due to my brother not getting to the uni in a ""normal"" way because he failed the general admission, so they needed to pay a higher tuition fee for him, hence why they still struggled even with my partial scholarship. Sometime, I didn't even have money to eat or for transport, so i would just walk or eat once a day (with lots of water). My degree didn't really let me have much time outside academics due to high load so I couldn't really work for extra income, though I volunteered for fund raising for uni events here and there. 

Then, I graduated my bachelor's struggling with money. I got my first job as an underpaid jr engineer in a consulting company, with literally less than $50 dollars to my name before my first pay check. Then, i went to make my parents happy by buying them meals on and things they wanted, with almost all of my pay check gone within 1 week. But i was happy, then came 2nd paycheck, THIS was the start, my father, struggling with his business needed extra money to keep things afloat, and he would lend my money every month, sometimes almost 80% of my meager salary went to help my father. Of course with the way things were, he was struggling to pay it back and most time, I just gave it away to him without payback. At this time, the financial situation in our family was so bad, with my brother in uni and my little sister starting school and my father's debt getting higher and higher, that I am basically the 2nd bread winner in the family. 

I was desperate for money and my meager consultant salary wouldn't cut it. So, I looked for a more high paying job and got into a mining company, but the work load and work hours were so high, I worked minimum 12 hours per day, 7 days a week, for 8 weeks straight, then 2 weeks off time. Then repeate and rinse. In the middle of nowhere/jungle. But I sucked it up, because I needed the money, I wanted to have savings, and I want to help my family. My dad still lend my money (most time not being able to pay it back and I just give it away), but the amount that was asked would still be kinda a huge chunk of my salary, like 30-60% at times, almost monthly. And when i went home, I would also repair or did the upkeep of our house (because it was in a state of disrepair/just cluttered mess everywhere due to not enough money for upkeep). I would buy brand new kitchen appliances to replace the broken ones, I would buy household items, treat my parent everytime i went back home, and often paid for the monthly grocery for the house when I went back for 2 weeks. Needless to say, I didn't have much saving due to all of that, but I still managed to save up little by little and I was gaining more confidence in my savings. 

Then one day, my father needed a huge sum of money for his failing business to keep things afloat, i am talking almost 70% of my painstakingly accumulated savings gone just like that. Ofc I never saw that money again. I cried, it hurted, I was angry, but at the end I gave in and just gave it away. He said that the money would be kind of an investment for me, that we would split the profit 50/50, ofc not, I already knew the pattern, I said to my dad just to split the profit from my investment with my mom instead to help with household, he said okay. 

At this point, as you can imagine, debts & poor family finances made my mom bitter and turned her into an angry woman with bad temper (sometimes I think she went insane because of financial struggle bcs she cant be reasoned with and logic doesnt go far with her). At home, during my 2-weeks off, I was never really be at peace, the house would be filled with angry yelling, shouting, and slammed doors. Sometimes I wonder how my little sister (that was still in middle school) felt growing up to that and being at home with them all the times. For me, at least, it was a bit better, during the ugly financial crisis, I was mostly at dormitory during HS, the student room across another city, then a literal jungle for work most of my time. I was rarely home. So, witnessing the full scale of their broken marriage really took a toll on my mental and overall view on money and marriages/relationship. I was expecting peace after grueling 8 weeks work that turned to another mental nightmare for another 2 weeks at home. Needless to say, I can say this confidently that I was never at peace for almost all my teenage-adult life. 

Then came covid, and my brother graduated uni. He looked for job, and got a job through family connection as a sales for heavy machinery in a big company. At first he was struggling, the 1st year was hard, but then at his 2nd years, he got the hang for sales and his income (through sales profit sharing) was gradually increasing, with almost higher than my salary by his 2nd year. At this time I am still helping my father full time with the money. My brother also helped, but he didn't help by lending my father much money, he literally didn't want to, so I needed to still help my father. 

Then I got fed up with my life and felt like I need to get away from this and upgrade myself. So I went and worked hard to get a scholarship for master's degree abroad. I did all the scholarships process and uni application while working min 12 hours shift 🙃. It was hell, but worth it. Then, I left the country for my master's in early 2023. By that time, I didn't have any income and told my parents and brother that I I couldn't help with family finances, and my brother needs to take over. By this time, his salary was twice of mine. I thought it wouldn't be that hard for him compared to me with my salary. I went abroad with full ride  scholarship (all transport, tuitions, allowance and everything in between paid), and enjoyed my life to the fullest, travelling, meeting new friends, cultures, learning about myself, aand acknowledging my trauma (mostly due to my family's situation) that I buried deep and thought it was normal to walk around wanting to day every week or so (lol). So, I feel liberated (at least for a awhile) it's not like i was without stress during my studies, I mean I was a scholarship student and need to perform well and not failing. 

I worked an internship during my master's study for 5 months. I saved the money from that job and from my scholarship, to bring both my parents to europe for my graduation. They've never been to Europe before. It was my dream to see them here witnessing my graduation ceremony. So in short, my bro paid for flight tickets, and I paid for their expenses hotel+travel+transport+meals during 2 weeks in europe. I also brought them to visit 4 european countries in total. I wiped almost all my european savings for them, but it was worth it. 

However, the happy things ended there. Global economy went to shit, then recession, it was quite literally impossible to find job with decent paying or even job in general. Now it's almost been 6 months since my graduation ceremony and I am still looking for job. I want to work in europe but they really are not that friendly for asian immigrant that can't speak their language fluently. So, I decided to go back home to save money and look for job from home. When I went back home, the house was in a poor state, half of electric circuit in the house was broken, the overall state of the house was unkept. To note, within my family, only I was the one to do house spring cleaning or just repairing stuffs. Eventho I am a literal female, but I feel really masc sometimes due to my circumstances and needs to step up alot. 

So with my savings, I repair the house and renovate the house a bit for better upkeep. I did all this without having a job. With my savings. And I also helped pay the electric bills every month and a part of my sister uni tuition (ONCE AGAIN while still being unemployed a.k.a job seeker. At first couple of months my family was being understanding of me saying that I want to rest because I was so burnt out. I DID MY ABSOLUTE BEST FOR A LONG TIME, I need a break. Then the 5th to 6th months after graduation came, my parents became more anxious of me not getting a job ( I am still in a couple of process of recruitment even as I write this post) so not completely nothing. But you know how long and bullshit the job recruitment now adays it takes literal monthsss!!! Not even guarantee of offering. 

And this is the main part, turns out my brother changed SO MUCH during the times that I was abroad. He became arrogant. He was making tons of money now, and having a successful career as sales with bright future career ahead. But he is arrogant, he looked down on my dad for being poor, looked down on me for not having jobs, always asking my mother how much did I give her monthly. THIS IS THE PROBLEM. I never really gave my mother a money transfer directly to her. It was always money to my father to keep thing afloat (and by that logic that money will also go to my mother). I WAS HELPING HER by buying thing needed around the house, electronics, kitchen appliance, house repairs, grocery, meals, things she wants, but never direct money. Because my logic is that, I can help by lessening the burden in the house instead. So by that definition, she doesn't need that money apart from monthly allowance from my father. and note that BUYING APPLIANCE/REPAIRS/GROCERY ETC ETC was not cheap, IT WAS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MY SALARY AT THAT TIME. 

I also paid for their travel during their stay in europe. I didn't realize that direct money transfer is what she also wants, on top of me also doing the house. So, she always (subtly) brought up how my brother's always do direct transfer to her, help monthly allowance for my sister when I wasn't here etc etc. LIKE HE IS THE GOOD SON AND I AM NOT A GOOD DAUGHTER. She said she never really felt I care for her (financially). WHEN QUITE LITTERALLY THAT WAS WHAT I WAS DOING the whole time, to make sure the house is kept, repaired , invested/helped with the money for DAD'S business, bills, so that my father can give my mother and quite literally keep the household afloat. BUT SHE DIDN'T SEE THAT. AND IT HURTS. I YELLED AT HER. I TOLD HER WHAT I WENT THROUGH, SHE KNEW AND SOMEHOW SHE STILL CHOSE TO TO FOGET ALL THAT I DID. And still chose my brother's side. 

And the worst part, my brother said to my mother what did I even contribute, I was basically a loser in his eyes for not having a job and having lower money than him. And my mother just sat through it all making excuses like that a daughter's duties are different than son's. Like what I did was meager compared to  my brother. When I literally acted like a 2nd bread winner for awhile before moving abroad. My brother is arrogant, he went out of line. If we talk about money give for the family. I WOULD SAY I GAVE WAY MUCH THAN HIM. And the ratio of our salary is also should be considered. He maybe only gave max 10% of his earnings while I gave more than 50% of all I had. So it's not even about amount but also the percentage. 

Ever since the argument, it is becoming harder to breathe, like a stone in my chest. I also cried and confide to my little sister who also doesn't like my brother's attitude and my mother's taking his side. And all this arguments started just because I suggested to my mother to cut unnecessary expenses, like buying coffees or tertiary needs, and just make it at home, so to save the money instead through etf/bonds, so that her saving wouldn't be eaten by inflation. I know she also suffers because of my father's bad financial decisions, but I feel like my mother can't be grateful for what she has now at least, it's not like we were living in a bad neighborhood or house, it is still a pretty middle class in my country. But she always compares herself with her more richer friends. Ofc she could never be happy. So, AITA?",4,1760994800.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1obtm6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranciliosilvia/comments/1obtm6c/my_silvia_pro_x_busted_creating_new_controller/,"My Silvia Pro X busted, creating new controller board and software from scratch","TLDR: looking for ideas to improve Silvia Pro X (creating custom controller board)

\*\*\*

Hi! A long time ago I owned a Silvia (not pro) for about a decade before I got tired with its obvious shortcomings. I was thinking about making some kind of PID upgrade or a controller board but then a miracle happened and I upgraded it to a Silvia Pro X.

Alas, Silvia Pro is not perfect either. Not bad enough to get me to make it my project but never good enough to have me completely satisfied.

For the past year though, the machine was increasingly failing on me until last week it did something unforgivable -- it allowed steam boiler to overheat, the emergency valve to activate, dump a bunch of steam and scare me shitless.

Determined to figure out the cause of the problem I untangled the mess of cables, I noticed a large puddle of water and a vacuum pipe ending right next to the controller with water clearly still visible in it (facepalm...). I fished away the controller board and found visible signs of water damage around the connectors going to the steam and brewing boiler heater (corroded parts, delaminated board...). And other pins also rusted and some other parts with visible signs of water damage.

I could simply repair the damage and 3d print a top portion of enclosure that would be much better at preventing water ingress. But now that I made it my project, I also want to design a new board and write replacement software that would make this much better behaved, more polished machine.

Here are some of my ideas:

1. I don't like the clunking sound of the pump/valve relays. I want to replace them with solid state relays (I am aware solid state relays produce way more heat, there will be better venting to prevent issues. Fortunately, the bottom plate is perforated under controller creating an opportunity for me to design natural flow of air to remove heat from the controller enclosure).
2. I don't like the fact that a simple short can cause any of the relays (and especially the boiler heaters) to become uncontrollable by the controller board. I plan to add a safety relay that will control power to all AC relays. This relay will have to be first turned on before any of boilers, pumps or valves can be switched on by its respective relay. In case the controller detects an abnormal situation or if it becomes inoperable (does not create specific timed signal) the relay will switch off automatically shutting down all power to anything that can create immediate damage.
3. I don't like the fact that the steam boiler looses power dramatically as I am steaming milk. The new controller will detect steaming and will immediately start dumping heat into the boiler to maintain temperature as much as possible and hopefully delay steam losing power. I will probably add some better temperature control to the steam boiler (at least a PID).
4. The functionality to turn Silvia on after a delay is a joke. Who has the presence of mind to turn the machine on every evening and then go into the menu and calculate how many hours from now it needs to delay its startup. I plan to put in an RTC with calendar so that it is possible to set up a schedule. A simple switch on the machine will need to be pressed every evening and a blinking LED will signal that it is on a delayed startup.
5. The pressure meter is kind of for cosmetic purposes only. I want to add an electronic pressure and flow meters with hopes that I can use those later in the controller. Or at least present the information to the user. Maybe stop brewing automatically after preset condition (for example, after specific volume of water or specific amount of time has passed).
6. I don't yet know if I want to add more complex display/controls to the machine to edit the schedule or if it will be controllable remotely (bluetooth/wifi/uart/sd card?) But there will be some way for the machine to store information about what is going on (temperatures, signals, history of abnormal operations) so that in case of fault it is possible to fetch the information and analyze the logs.
7. I plan to add more precise temperature measurement. I have some experience with really precise temperature measurements. I can add some additional high quality RTD sensors (water tank temperature, group head temperature) so that the controller can better model the water temperature that will be used to brew the coffee.

So now the question, do you people have some other ideas how you could improve the functioning of this machine?",4,1760993899.0,ranciliosilvia,7,1.0,False

Been testing cashback apps for the past year like they're side quests in my daily grind. Tried Rakuten, Honey, Capital One Shopping, and a bunch of others that promised easy money but delivered headaches instead.

ShopBack has been the real MVP - tracks everything I buy without me having to chase missing transactions or email support constantly. It just works in the background while I shop normally.

After about 8 months of regular use (Amazon, groceries, travel bookings), I've quietly earned around $230. Nothing crazy, but it's been covering my Netflix, Spotify, and coffee runs without me thinking about it.

The key difference: I don't treat it like a side hustle. Just shop through the app when I remember, and it accumulates. No hunting for deals or changing my buying habits.

Anyone else found cashback tools that actually deliver without the BS? Or are most people trying once and forgetting about them?

1obt7s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1obt7s0/what_are_the_typical_etiquette_rules_for_hosting/,What are the typical etiquette rules for hosting or being a guest where dinner is served?,"I was raised with pretty strict etiquette rules, and I'm beginning to think I'm now way off-base with current etiquette. I have the largest house of most of my friends and all extended family, so I get asked to host a lot for holidays and get-togethers. As a host, I feel the rules are:

1. I provide a large variety of beverages, and I ask each person what they like to drink so I have some of what they prefer on hand for each guest. This includes soda, flavored waters, tea, coffee, and liquor/beer/wine. I buy a lot of the common items (beer and soda) so people don't have to think twice about have 6-8 beverages at my house. Also, all beverages should be name brand, not the cheap stuff.

2. I provide ample, high-quality food. I need to inquire about any food allergies or preferences beforehand, and create multiple menu options if need be for things like lactose intolerance, gluten issues, food allergies, and general preferences. I also need to provide high quality food, so healthy and not super cheap (unless it's a game night and the menus is just pizza). I also have enough food and snack such that no one has to hold back, and everyone can have seconds and thirds if they wish.

3. If it's a pot luck situation, I explain that up front and assign a general category (like dessert, a snack, dip, a vegetable, etc.). 

If I'm a guest:

1. I bring a side, snack or share-able appropriate for the occasion. For a game night or something casual, chips and dip or a veg tray is fine. If I know the host is doing something labor intensive or expensive (like Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner), I bring a side that reflects that (an expensive cheese tray, a homemade bread or side, fancy wine, etc.). I make sure to bring more than enough so all guests can get a portion of my side if they wish. I always bring something, even if it isn't a stated potluck situation, but I always ask and stick to the category the host needs if it is. 

I find I'm getting upset lately at friends and family at get-togethers, so I think the problem is me. I have family who brought an open bag of stale, generic-brand chips for Christmas dinner. I have assigned a friend the veg tray at a potluck, and they brought one that was clearly marked for discount and was half-rotten. I had another friend that brought 5 small apples as a side to a get-together with 10 people. When one family hosts, we all know we need to pre-eat before we leave, because there is never enough food for everyone (we all get child-sized portions, and they have run out of food before).

This is happening more and more lately, so I think I'm off. I think I'm too rigid with my learned ""rules"" for hosting and being a guest and I need to let them go and embrace what the new situation is. I know I can't tell people ""hey, so this side was too cheap/too small"" or ""I'm sorry, but you didn't make enough food for the group.""

Can you all tell me, where am I going wrong here? What are the rules for hosting and being a guest when food is involved? ",1,1760993020.0,etiquette,8,0.6,False

Today the thoughts were LOUDDDD!! I have definitely slipped a little today, just in little things like the butter, no sweets, no nuts, no butter in my jacket when I wanted it etc. These are all MINOR things to normal people, who in fact would probably not even notice them but to me its restriction and I know once these things Strat they spiral so I am calling myself out because I want to stay at home !! and I want my life and relationships back and these behaviours do the very opposite of that.

I am struggling the most at the minute with food noise and wanting to eat more - but I am realising the food noise was probably partciualry bad today because I was restricting and cutting corners in certain ways - whereas a few days ago when I was adding butter as I pleased, eating nuts and sweets without judgement the food noise was much less and you'll never guess what - I wasn't as hungry - what a surprise!! Hey Ho! I suppose it is all a learning curve but I have so much riding on Wednesday that I am scared whatever the outcome!

I didn't ask her our because I was in a relationship. It wasn't a good one and I ended it 2 months ago. I work in an international company. We are providing support for an American production line. We have our own managers here, in our line of work, but this guy who is the general manager of the company as a whole production unit in Western Europe.

We never got along well with him. He was spitelul because the work was somehow outsourced to us and he wanted it under him. He looked down on us because we are from Eastrn Europe too. Constantly unhappy with out work, constantly complaining about us. Last year he talked down to this woman in question and she went home crying. We met him face to face only this year.

He came in January and in summer. Intimidating. Very tall, expensive watch tie, shirt. I avoided him. Most of us did. He stayed for one month, both in summer and in winter. Didn't even look at us, he went for a smoke and coffee with the head of our department and the poor guy told us next day that he needs sick leave due to having to spend time with the this man. We met at the elevator, he didn't say hello, didn't answer to our hello.

So this is the kind of man he is. Arrogant and with god complex. And a few weeks ago, this woman that I said I have a strong crush on, told us in a meeting that she is moving (within the same company) to work directly at the production unit. So an upgrade in her career.

I knew a long distance thing wouldn't work, but at least I wanted to ask her out on a single date, casually. I am also leaving this company starting November so I had nothing to lose.. We used to be very close and I felt she likes me too. And she told me the truth about the real reason she is moving. He is married btw.",1,1760992063.0,WhatShouldIDo,5,0.67,False
1obsl8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Terminator/comments/1obsl8s/sarah_and_kyles_story_is_a_really_respectful_and/,Sarah and Kyle’s story is a really respectful and beautiful relationship,"Growing up, I became even more fond of their love story. I mean, a man crossed time for a woman, risked his life for her and asked for nothing in return (of course he was used to fighting and destroying machines, but it’s way different when you’re now the only one knowing how to do that with no one to help you, the weapon in 1980s is nowhere near effective as what you used to have in your time, and there’s police all around who’ll just incarcerate you if you don’t hide and will never believe you). Even this part lets me see how she developed feelings for him. I mean, the regular men she’d face in her time would probably hope to get laid after just taking her out on a coffee date. 
Also, he really admires her strength, even when she doesn’t believe in herself at all, sees a lot past her external beauty (tho she’s drop dead gorgeous, and I’m a straight woman), even saying about her picture he just slightly mentions her looks and then goes on saying how he always wanted to know what she really felt and what she was thinking of, noting that she was sad (I don’t know about you guys, but I believe that even this seemingly minor detail is really something, because even though he used to always keep his own emotions and feelings under control in order to survive and save others, yet he was still emotionally intelligent enough to pay attention to her feelings. In just a picture, not even face to face. Which definitely says she was way more than looks and some simple random woman from a bygone peaceful world to him. And it’s a PTSD-riddled guy!). 
Moreover, it’s so important to note how Sarah is scared he is disappointed in her after he saw real her, not just with her strengths, but also weaknesses. And he outrightly replies “no, I’m not”. The movie and the love story in particular wouldn’t have been the same even without this small detail. It lets the viewer know he still loves real her, not only the one who would exist afterwards and known from her son’s stories (though no one could definitely know Sarah better than John too), but also the scared, anxious and just a regular normal girl she is at this point. By that time she had already shown him her fear, anger, pain, desperation (even tried to bite him once!), and that never made him love and admire her less. Another good sign (in a world where so many men call women “emotional”, “difficult”, “hysterical” left and right) is that he never once tried to downplay her emotions, he understood what she was going through then, even though he himself was from a completely different world, being, again, a hardened soldier. 
Not to mention the fact that even though Sarah is completely dependent on him in terms of survival throughout most of the movie, Kyle never once tries to take advantage of it. I mean, he could have manipulated her in every possible way, knowing she’d never leave him because her whole existence depended on Kyle, and still he doesn’t pressure her into anything, even though he was a virgin. And it also speaks volumes about him because how a man treats a woman who is dependent on him in any way also says a whole lot. Whatever happens, he keeps respecting Sarah and her boundaries. 
If anything, he probably wouldn’t even have revealed his feelings to her, hadn’t she started showing her interest herself by asking him about the women he might have had in his time. But even then he is scared AF after having confessed her his love, he just walks away in fear and shame before she herself reciprocates it all and shows him she wants him. Some people say she fell in love too fast, but come on… She is a girl from the 80s, not that much feminism and respect for women were taught to men at the time as we all know. And then she meets someone like him, who under the most stressful circumstances turns out to be like that. I’m living in 2025 and even I would fall in love, let alone the 80s. These are not just green flags, these are the greenest of the green, for one can hardly wear a mask and pretend in this kind of situation. Some people fall in love with each other real fast in a completely calm and normal life, with no room for being this real, and this is not even their case, their situation was something beyond which one could hardly be afraid of any other hardships. 
By the end of the movie, it’s not just him saving her, it’s her trying to save him too. She drags him half-dead first from under the smashed car, then in the factory, even being the target herself and knowing that the cyborg doesn’t need Kyle unless he is an obstacle. This love and selflessness is not one-sided (and it never was, in fact, Sarah showed him her care back under the bridge while on the run when she wanted to bandage his wound and he acted as if it wasn’t a big deal. Of course, she didn’t feel that way at that point yet, but I’m sure it also made Kyle see more about her and what she is like under stress). She persistently refuses to run without him even when she is at the greatest risk. 
Breaks my heart every time that he died and the story didn’t get a chance to continue. Love them to the moon and back
