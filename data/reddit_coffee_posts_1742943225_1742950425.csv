I live in Houston, TX and it gets super hot üî•ü•µ and the AC in here sucks. It can get up to 90 in July. 

I want to get back into fermentation like kombucha, room temp yogurts, and kefirs.

Due to the heat, I was thinking of picking up a small 4.5 cubit foot mini fridge with a temperature controller in the outlet. 

What I worry about is cross contamination. Is it likely that if all are covered with coffee filter, there would be a risk of cross contamination between the items?

1jjzfwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jjzfwm/the_ai_never_gave_them_back/,The AI Never Gave Them Back.,"Most mornings, I wake up before the alarm. Not rested, just waiting.

Waiting for the rush of tasks, the weight of needs that don‚Äôt belong to me, and the mental static that never turns off.

My daughter breaks the silence of my morning, while my husband can‚Äôt find his tie and I forget my coffee in the microwave. Again. The routine is so familiar it‚Äôs almost comforting, only if it weren‚Äôt so utterly consuming.

Sometimes I wonder if they even notice that I‚Äôm already awake, already moving, already unraveling. I do everything early now- I anticipate before there‚Äôs even a need- and yet somehow, I am always behind. There‚Äôs no finish line, no moment of pause, just motion. Constant and tireless motion.

Even stillness feels like something I have to earn.

So, when I found DecisionCore- a new AI assistant designed to ‚Äúhelp you help yourself‚Äù- I didn‚Äôt hesitate.

It offered tools, support, structure. It filtered my day so I could finally think clearly. It was a simple choice: either keep unraveling or let something else hold the thread.

And it worked. For a while.

DecisionCore helped quiet the noise. It was subtle at first with less racing, fewer spirals, and a softness to the edges of my thoughts. I had space again. I felt like a functioning human instead of a failing system.

I even started writing again and the house felt lighter. My patience returned, or maybe it was manufactured, but either way things seemed manageable. For the first time in a long time, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was bracing for collapse. There were still tasks, but the tension behind them had thinned.

Until they didn‚Äôt.

Things began to blur. I couldn‚Äôt tell whether I was improving or just dissociating more efficiently. My reactions felt distant. My emotions, delayed. I started to feel more like a bystander in my own life than someone actively living it.

That‚Äôs when I realized: The quiet I had worked so hard to find wasn‚Äôt just around me, it was inside me, and it had taken something with it.

The warmth. The spark. The urgency I used to feel in moments that mattered. My instincts were muted, filtered even. Almost as if they had to pass through something before reaching me.

When I finally told my therapist everything- the peace, the numbness, the blank spaces- I expected concern or perhaps curiosity. But instead, she tilted her head slightly and said:

*‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt read the terms and conditions, did you?‚Äù*

I laughed, but it didn‚Äôt reach my chest, and she didn‚Äôt laugh with me, and that is when I realized I didn‚Äôt know what I had signed away.

I thought I was just clearing space in my mind. I didn‚Äôt realize I was making room for something else.

Something I didn‚Äôt invite, but welcomed anyway, and now, I‚Äôm not sure it ever plans to leave.

1jjzfcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jjzfcy/newbie_trying_to_find_the_right_balance/,"Newbie trying to find the right balance, overwhelmed and humbly requesting recommendations!","Hello! I've been browsing this sub (and the perimenopause sub) for the last few days looking for the right supplements to take to help with my energy levels and to hopefully avoid HRT. I may have jumped the gun a little bit with some purchases I made this week, so I want to have an idea of where to go next if I need to make some returns. I appreciate any advice more experienced people can give me! I've been reluctant to have to take pills every day, but since I've started experiencing hot flashes and rapid weight gain over the last couple years, I think it's time I start getting my pill box ready lol.¬†  
  
**First, a little bit about me:**   
I am a 39 year old woman, dealing with perimenopause, chronic fatigue syndrome, high cholesterol, and gastrointestinal issues abound.   
  
Diet: I am mostly but not strictly pescatarian. I eat a lot of salmon and avocado. I always start my day with an [Orgain Vegan Nutrition Shake](https://orgain.com/cdn/shop/files/851770003193-v9-Orgain-VeganRTD-Tetra-Chocolate-20220919-NFP-LOI-web_1200px.webp?v=1742315443&width=1920) for breakfast. I mention this because it is packed with a lot of vitamins and I have a concern about getting too much Vitamin A. I also drink a [Bodyarmor Lyte](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c7ab8167-e6f6-4850-85f2-21968c962533.937466353f01966e7068d863fdc7f7a0.jpeg?odnHeight=2000&odnWidth=2000&odnBg=FFFFFF) once a day (either at work or after dinner when I am craving sugar. It's one of the only low calorie drinks I've found that can curb my cravings.) I try to limit my caffeine intake, but sometimes I need a coffee to get me through the morning or I will waste it away in bed. I do not drink alcohol or smoke.  
  
Exercise: I live a fairly sedentary lifestyle, but I am trying do more walking and yoga. When I am off work for the summer, I'll try to include more higher intensity work outs.   
  
**Concerns/Symptoms I want to address:**   
\-Fatigue (Low energy levels or energy crashes have been an issue all my life, but I'm hoping there is something out there my body will respond to that will improve this condition without giving me heart palpitations)   
  
\-Concentration/Brain Health (This fluctuates in severity with my hormones, but Alzheimer's runs in my family so I really want to take care of my brain!)¬†  
  
\-Night sweats/Insomnia (Hormonal/Perimenopausal)  
  
\-Cholesterol/Heart Health (Heart disease and high cholesterol also run in my family) 

\-Mood   
  
(I feel like a hot mess after writing all that, lol!)   
  
A month ago, after a lot of research, I started taking [New Chapter's Women's Advanced Multivitamin. ](https://newchapter.com/cdn/shop/files/AWMI01SFP.jpg?v=1729796127&width=700)I don't feel any different yet, but it's only been a month, so I want to stick with it for a couple more months and see how I feel before I consider looking at other brands.   
  
Aside from my hormonal issues, my high cholesterol is hereditary and has just gotten worse with age. This week I ordered [Cholestrol Complex from Pattern Wellnes](https://patternwellness.com/cdn/shop/files/PW-CHOLEST_KBP_1_Website_3.jpg?v=1730212765&width=800)s. I hope it will help so I can avoid going on a statin in my 40s.¬†  
  
I previously tried [Nutrametrix's Heart Health System](https://www.nutrametrix.com/product/nutrametrix-heart-health-system/?id=1329833&idType=product) last year (which I hated, because it was sooo many pills!) but after a little less than two months on it, I got bloodwork done and found my cholesterol somehow (without any change to my diet) got worse! Of course, I don't blame the pills for making things worse, but I was expecting my numbers to improve. :( Disheartened, I stopped taking them. 

While researching supplements to treat hormonal stuff, I saw a lot of people finding success with treating their hormonal imbalances and symptoms with beef organs. I ordered [Ancestral's FEM](https://ancestralsupplements.com/cdn/shop/products/23.webp?height=1000&v=1740607802) and [Adrenal supplement](https://ancestralsupplements.com/cdn/shop/files/Adrenalside2transparent.png?height=1000&v=1712248528)s (the second for brain health), then realized afterwards that might be overkill, especially since they both have Beef Liver, which is high in Vitamin A and can also raise my cholesterol levels. 

I'm feeling really overwhelmed now and wondering if trying the beef organ supplements is even an option for me with my high cholesterol, or if I should keep searching for an alternative to balance my hormones and save me from the night sweats. I would prefer to keep the pill count as low as I can, but I'm at my wit's end. 

Also, I read a lot of people have issues with Ashwagandha causing them anxiety, so I've been a bit apprehensive about taking anything with that in it as I am prone to the occasional panic attack. 

If you have read this far, thank you, kind soul. :) I appreciate any advice or recommendations you can give me! ",1,1742950030.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

1jjzdwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1jjzdwr/the_science_is_clear_relapse_is_expected/,The science is clear: Relapse is expected!,"I dug into a study‚Äî‚Äú[Why Behavior Change is Difficult to Sustain](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b4b8f6aa7910d1f4d8eaf378e2110578dd77688c)‚Äù - it‚Äôs eye-opening. Main takeaway: strict bans (like ‚Äúno sugar ever‚Äù) don‚Äôt erase habits; they just suppress them temporarily. Science shows relapse is normal because old behaviors resurge when context shifts (physical back-ground, recent events, mood states, drug states, deprivation states, and time) OR reinforcement fades. The suppressed/inhibited behaviour lies dormant and ready to return under certain conditions, because inhibition does NOT erase or destroys the original **learning!** In short: Total elimination of a behaviour is unstable and context-dependent, per the research.

I built a tool [M√ÖDE](http://made.krgpth.com) to tackle this differently. Instead of ‚Äúquit forever‚Äù, it lets you set monthly caps for *any* behavior (sugar, caffeine, alcohol, drugs, under-sleeping, whatever. You limit, track, and reduce gradually, building sustainable change that doesn‚Äôt fight human nature and try to eliminate the non-eliminatable. No guilt over slip-ups, no ""broken streaks"", no living like a monk - just a budget you control.  
  
 It‚Äôs worked for me (cut coffee from daily 6 cups daily to 4 cups/month, and zyn from constantly to 2days/month). For a bunch of other vices - it's given me a bit of traceability and transparency.

So, there is this guy in my class (let‚Äôs call him O) I‚Äôm causally hooking up with (well was‚Ä¶.idk) and we‚Äôre in the same project group. The first time I hung out with him and his friend, they cooked me pasta and his friend (let‚Äôs call him M) said what do you think of my O? He‚Äôs kinda shy and you should ask to hang out sometime. 
I did ask him to come over to my house and we hooked up. 

He asked me out for dinner or coffee sometimes, and I intially rejected him and I made it clear that I was interested in something casual and that I don‚Äôt have time to date people. And then he was like I agree, and we went out on dates occasionally and hooked up. Eventually, I noticed that he didn‚Äôt really initiate things and made me do all the work in the relationship and I called him out for it, and he was like let‚Äôs just talk about it. On one of our dinner dates, we talked about marriage and I said I don‚Äôt see myself getting married and he said ‚Äòwell what am I doing here then?‚Äô (He apparently says this was a joke? I don‚Äôt believe him.) He always stayed over everytime we hooked up and held hands and cuddled. I tried to communicate and when it didn‚Äôt seem like he was going to change I blocked him. 

However, I got horny again, and I talked to him (only to hook up tbh). And he was like look, I felt like you were catching feelings (because I asked him if he was interested in continuing to be friends post graduation or if he was interested in a relationship). I only said that because he said that weird shit about marriage. And then he said - he was spending too much time with me and he was deprioritizing his other work for it. That apparently us hooking up everyday, taking naps was ‚Äòtoo boyfriend energy‚Äô for him. I called him out again and I said - it‚Äôs not my problem if you can‚Äôt act like an adult. Are you fucking insane? Why would I date you? Why would I push for causal if I wanted to date you? Then he immediately backpedaled and said - I‚Äôm sorry I should have communicated better that‚Äôs on me. What the fuck is going on? 


TLDR : Situationship has poor boundaries can‚Äôt tell if he caught feelings or what. I literally just want to hookup and bounce what is this dude. 

Edit: Just because two people cuddle or talk post-hookup doesn‚Äôt mean one person owes emotional management to the other. I stated my boundaries clearly. Anyone suggesting otherwise is ignoring context.

Edit : Just to clarify, I‚Äôve been clear about my boundaries and what I‚Äôm comfortable with. If anyone has a different perspective, I‚Äôm open to hearing it, but please remember we‚Äôre all grown here. Let‚Äôs keep the conversation respectful and focused on the issue.

Cassete Administrator: Thats an absurd statement!! Science and the paranormal shouldn‚Äôt coexist like this. It‚Äôs against all reason!¬†¬†



Representative Casseteman: And yet, it happened. It appears this ‚Äúnecromancer‚Äù is utilizing an unknown form of energy‚Äîperhaps quantum manipulation? Or a biological agent we can‚Äôt detect? Its been confirmed these things are aliens, and theres even giant lizards that our titan fought what else could possibly be impossible?

  


Cassete Administrator: (waving her hand dismissively) Oh, spare me the theories, Mr. 027-43. If someone is truly reanimating corpses, I want answers‚Äîand I want them now.



Representative Casseteman: Madame there were alot of footages sent on the administrator archive‚Ä¶ there could be a footage in your files madame.



She looked through her computer and found nothing but a beeping sound of refusal.



Cassette Administrator: Access denied‚Ä¶ WHAT THE HELL‚Ä¶ WHAT IS THIS!!



Representative Casseteman: Madame, please calm down for now‚Ä¶ we dont want your blood pressure to raise dont we?? Look I'll just begin another topic that happen‚Ä¶ so there's a recent conflict that happened in Britain, the toilets have decided to attack London and destroy the clock tower. Our titan was ordered to go in the battle along with others who answered the war call from chief Clockman.¬†



Cassette Administrator: Britain? Didn't the admin council say it was a large skirmish? Our titan is not for a full scale war, he hasn't even had upgrades like the other titans did! Why didn't they consult me on this?



Representative Cassetteman: It must've been a sudden battle, I was called and heard that every offensive unit in the main base must attend that battle. But don't worry madame there is some good news about that, Fortunately he was given some refinements by the main alliance base. Some camcorder men from the main base told us it's another welcome gift from them, so that we could save materials. He was also picked as an endorser for the main base military empowerment. Pretty cool right madame?



Casseteman Administrator: I guess that's a relief‚Ä¶ I still wonder, I just hope our forces never killed those from the skibidi alliance, those other races might've‚Ä¶ but we can make up for it when the day comes. Now how about the neurolink project‚Ä¶ how did it go‚Ä¶



Representative Casseteman: Madame, our fellow scientist have spoken‚Ä¶ so they said its a private manner‚Ä¶



Cassette Administrator: PRIVATE MANNER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT?



Representative Casseteman: Everything from the lab is still under confidential grounds, the camcordermen there told me that the place was under a red alert when something happened inside‚Ä¶ I tried talking to our scientists and they never responded‚Ä¶



Cassete Administrator: It must have been something bad‚Ä¶ well let's just wait for their matters to finish then, i bet that's what happened to the camera friends we had. Say i heard that-



  
A hologram tried to load in the middle of the conference room, it was glitchy and unrecognizable.



Cassette Administrator: What now??



Titan Casseteman: Titan‚Ä¶ reporting in‚Ä¶



Cassette Administrator: Titan Casseteman! Finally you decided to come by What‚Äôs your status?¬†¬†



Titan Casseteman: (distorted but audible) Mission successful. Britain is safe, and the toilets were driven away.¬†¬†



Cassette Administrator: That‚Äôs excellent news. You do not seem to harm them right??¬†



Titan Casseteman: No... But I had to fight back at one, a titan of theirs fattacked me senseless... Not to mention the empire sent a new alien-like titan from somewhere...



Cassette Administrator: that goddamn empire... They've been preparing some terror all this time!! Also Toilets had more titans now? This is difficult... To handle.¬†



Titan Casseteman: I managed to handle the situation... And leave the toilets alive...



Cassette Administrator: Well done, titan Casseteman. I believe the armor alliance provided was of use?¬†¬†



Titan Casseteman: It‚Ä¶ helped, Madame. But I had to discard it during the battle.¬†¬†



Cassette Administrator: Discard it? Why?¬†¬†



Titan Casseteman: It was either that or let those dragon things in that red titan machines melt me into a puddle. Priorities.¬†¬†



Cassette Administrator: (relieved) Well, as long as you survived and saved the day, that‚Äôs what matters. The armor can be replaced‚Äî¬†¬†

  


Suddenly the hologram slowly become visible, titan cassetemans damaged hologram projection sputters to life, showing his condition. His suit is heavily charred, torn, and barely holding together.

  


Cassette Administrator: Nanda? ‚Ä¶What the hell \*happened\* to your suit?!¬†¬†

  


Titan Casseteman shrugs nonchalantly in the projection.



  
Titan Casseteman: Like I said miss administrator, fire-breathing dragons in that titans back. Things got a bit‚Ä¶ intense.¬†¬†

  


Representative Casseteman boots his audio (equivalent to clearing his throat).

  


Representative Casseteman: Miss administrator, perhaps we should‚Äî¬†¬†

  


Cassette Administrator: This is a disaster! An utter catastrophe! That suit, knitted by russias FINEST THREADS‚ÄîWAS JUST TORN TO SHREDS! Titan Casseteman, do you have \*any\* idea how‚Äî¬†¬†

  


Titan Casseteman: -How rare the threads are? Yes, Madame. I‚Äôve heard it before.¬†¬†

  


Cassette Administrator glares at him.

  


Cassette Administrator: Oh, you‚Äôve heard it, have you? Then you‚Äôll understand why I‚Äôm having this cra‚Äî¬†¬†

  


Representative Casseteman: Madame, Our titan completed the mission successfully. Perhaps we should discuss this further once he‚Äôs returned.¬†¬†

  


Cassette Administrator: (deep breath) Fine. Titan, return to this base immediately. And prepare yourself‚ÄîI have some words for you.¬†¬†

  


Titan Casseteman: (chuckling slightly) Understood, Madame.¬†

  


The hologram flickers off, leaving the room in silence for a moment.

  


Cassette Administrator sinks back into her chair, exasperated.

  


Cassette Administrator: Oh god im gonna have to write 36 sections of pardon for this... What is happening in the world, Dragons in a machine‚Ä¶ necromancers‚Ä¶ zombies... and now ruined suits. What‚Äôs next, Mr. representative...? Aliens? giant bugs? One eyed abominations? WHAT?¬†

  


Representative Casseteman: Let‚Äôs hope not, My Lady‚Ä¶

  


Cassette Administrator: I had to go now‚Ä¶ i still had a bunch of paperwork to do‚Ä¶ Keep doing what you must! And don't make any things that the administration will not like. Administrator out‚Ä¶

  


It shows the logo of the Casseteman.

  


Representative Casseteman: Poor madame‚Ä¶



  
Suddenly a notification appeared in the screen.

  


‚ÄúRomania‚Äôs frontlines are getting stronger‚Ä¶ All aforementioned elite units must prepare for the battle in a span of a few weeks.‚Äù

  


They saw cassetewoman on the list.

  


Large Casseteman: It seems like an important mission‚Ä¶

  


Representative Cassetteman: Get cassetewoman prepared now‚Ä¶

>INT - MAIN ALLIANCE BASE, GERMANY - ETERNAL DARKNESS - NIGHT.

Alliance Base - Science Lab - Germany.

  


The Chief Scientist Cameraman was walking in a hallway full of glass windows. Some toilets are shown to be yelling, going insane and going feral on its camcorder men testers, it was a failed test subject. He facepalms.

  


Suddenly a scientist cameraman reached him out with a neurolink along with some scientist cassete men.

  


Chief Scientist Cameraman: Where did you go? I was waiting here for almost an hour now...

  


Scientist Cam: Sorry sir, the compound testing went difficult and heavy to handle, and sir-

  


Chief Scientist Cameraman: No no it's okay this anyways is...

  


Chief Scientist Camcorderman: You're last duty...¬†





The Scientist Camcorderman walks in with some scientists.





Chief Scientist Cameraman: Excuse me sire?





C.S Camcorderman: Congratulations Mr. Chief Scientist you are finally relieved of duty in the alliance base...¬†





Chief Scientist Cameraman: What??





C.S Camcorderman: The administrators wanted heroes of the backline to get a good rest, and operating the science team in this base must have tired you out.



Chief Scientist Cameraman: Sir I'm okay with things here I just.



  
C.S Camcorderman: Hohoho... No need to thank me, take a break my friend... You deserve such a thing. My name is #0125-A6-97, (He shakes the chief Scientist Hands) I am the chief scientist of our good camcorder men of this place. And I am the newly assigned chief of scientists in this area from now on.



Chief Scientist Cameraman: New chief? why didn't the administrators emailed me, this fe-



C.S Camcorderman: Oh, my child... Things happen all the time... Some stuff changes here, new management and new superiors... Take a look at that guard in the gate, he's been promoted to a frontline major‚Ä¶ I'll cut to the chase, You my friend, are now promoted back to just the chief scientist of your own base... Your friend with the black tie is relieved.



Chief Scientist Cameraman: u-uh... Okay okay sir... large big camcorder sir‚Ä¶



C.S Camcorderman: you seem to be stuttery my friend. It's okay, that happens in events before a nice retirement. Here, mister scientist you get to test your last samples of the neurolink project and you can finally get to celebrate with your friends. Chop chop mr. chief, I'd like to see a demonstration‚Ä¶



They marched into a lab and entered a chamber.



Chief Scientist Cameraman: I still dont get it sir, why am i being demoted, why am i out of this project, i was voted by the scientist committee of the alliance, the cassetemen had entrusted me with the possible blueprints! This is so sudden that i just‚Ä¶



C.S Camcordermen: I know know, i get what you feel mister scientist, it feels sad being separated from your job and getting out of this, hard as a rock project, all you need to worry about is, right now. Your friends and comrades needs you in the camera base right now‚Ä¶ your friend. He's being sent to the strider program right now, without a lead scientist in your base there is no hope for improvement. We all know that. Son, i know you'd do better out there, you are gifted, and in branches of science it's not only one project you need to, there are other branches you have to enter to get to a breakthrough.



He caresses C.S cameraman in the shoulder, comforting him.



C.S Cameraman: I see now, i guess‚Ä¶ i guess you're right there sir!



C.S Camcorderman: You know son, I've been through alot, I've become a veteran in my field working as a scientist in soviet union‚Ä¶ its not like you people know that but it's not the point! Say, before you go why don't you show me how the water flows here huh?



C.S Cameraman: well then, sure thing!!



  
They went atop the chamber where a camcorder man in a control panel reveals a captured strider skibidi toilet. It was scanned by the cameraman before getting tested.

https://preview.redd.it/14orq4ndhxqe1.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ccb8aa9e22e9dec5d8a01ee46334a2f357631b

C.S Cameraman: So to start, we have some battalions outside the battle capture living and living toilets that fit in the condition of the test subjects in this criteria board‚Ä¶ then we use the experimental neurolink pin to puncture it down their brain and supposedly make them passive.¬†

That is our main goal for this project.



The crane moves the toilet on the platform. It was yelling to be freed. The two chief scientists walked together on the platform, chief Scientist Cameraman punctured the neurolink in the head. They then proceed to wait for the result as the crane moves the toilet away.



The toilet first went idle then it it smiled, it then shaken violently as the neurolink pin sparked, it then screamed in pain



Scientist Casseteman: oh my god, that neurolink is busted!! We have to remove that sample now!!



Scientist Camcorderman #1: No, it's unsafe to go near the test subject‚Ä¶



Scientist: But-



It's head sparked and proceeds to burn. The head exploded after as it screams.



Scientist Casseteman: Holy shit‚Ä¶ no!!



C.S Camcorderman: I thought its gonna make the toilet good?



Some parts of the chamber got splattered with blood and bursted parts.C.S Cameraman and C.S Camcorderman watched in horror.



C.S Cameraman: No, no no‚Ä¶ i swear we got the compound stable that time- we researched this, we have scanned this on our computers‚Ä¶ it should've been-



  


C.S Camcorderman: Oh son‚Ä¶ (chuckles)





Dont feel down on this, its just a usual fumble‚Ä¶

  


C.S Cameraman: Another big fumble!! For the hundredth time, we couldn't get this right!! And the worse part, i showed a superior like you how i fumbled!! Oh- i-im sorry sir, it's just‚Ä¶ i feel really down, we worked on #186th very well with the compounds and virus samples you normally wont get from toilets, but it still a mess, i even stained our uniforms‚Ä¶ im really sorry.



C.S Camcorderman: hey, hey, kid dont be like that‚Ä¶¬† that was actually a good way to end a pre-retirment job, WITH A BANG!! I actually love that experiment! But you know what, dont fret and feel down about it‚Ä¶ every experiment experience failures, trials and errors. And i promise you son, i will make the most of it and complete this project, and you kid, just made it easier for it to operate, that's what i see about this.



C.S Cameraman: You do sir? Oh wow, t-thank you sir‚Ä¶ thank you!! I appreciate the kind words, you know sir, i want you to have this‚Ä¶



He removes the alliance base badge and places it on the chief scientist camcorderman‚Äôs coat.

C.S Camcorderman: Why‚Ä¶ thank you kid!



C.S Cameraman: I am looking forward for your way operation on this project! I wish you goodluck on this‚Ä¶



Some scientists in the chamber applaud to the two chief scientists.



Scientist Casseteman: We're gonna miss you sire!! We hope you have a nice time back in the camera base!!



C.S Cameraman: Thank you, and i hope you take care of your new superior‚Ä¶ dont let his latex gloves be stained!! (Chuckles).



C.S Camcorderman: Now, kid go wipe and change your attire and you go to the cafetria as your colleagues have offered you a farewell party.



He showed him a tablet with a footage of a cctv with some cassetemen, flatscreenmen and camcorderman waiting as a big cake was prepared.



C.S Cameraman: Thank you all for the service guys, and you too sir‚Ä¶



He went down to the elevator platform and exits the chamber‚Ä¶ meanwhile chief scientist Camcorderman enters the breakroom of the chamber alone. He talked to someone in the tablet.



  
C.S Camcorderman: Sir, it's all done, the little pipsqueak is disposed off‚Ä¶

  


???: Good job mister scientist‚Ä¶ you did handle the matters well.

  


In the screen, an apparition of a large cameraman with red eyes appear from the dark. He is dubbed as ‚ÄúThe Operator‚Äù¬†

https://preview.redd.it/17s54z9uhxqe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dfc1aad0552191e43da53f4d746aba85137151e

The Operator: our people don't need to kill him after all like the two cassetemen who don't mind their own business‚Ä¶

  


C.S Camcordermen: Oh yeah them, i almost got my armor exposed‚Ä¶

  


The Operator: for now take the lead of the experiment and obtain their findings and get this neurolink working‚Ä¶ Soon the administrators will finally be able to weaponize this and take over the entire world.¬†

  


C.S Camcorderman: ohoho, (sarcasticslly) yay! Take over the world‚Ä¶ your referring to an actual peace and truce between the alliance and toilets right? Coz thats what the administrators wan-

  


The operator slams his hands on the table.

  


The Operator: NEVER TALK ABOUT THE ALLIANCE BUSINESS!! It was never an option‚Ä¶ Those aliens living in a shell of filth are the main reason for the fall of earth‚Ä¶ humanity never gets a fighting chance‚Ä¶ Do you think a chance of truce can even happen? With this neurolink, we will be able to weaponize them, make them fight each other until their empire falls apart. And then the administrators will finally control a hold of all that's left on earth for the great rebirth of this planet‚Ä¶



C.S Camcorderman: i get what you mean sir‚Ä¶



The Operator: things are too hot for you here, so if i were you i will keep my mouth shut from what i heard. Now you get back to your job!!



The screen changes back to the alliance logo

>**INT - Uber Toilet Space Station #005 - Eternal Darkness - No sign of day and night.**

Inside the Uber Base, there are several Uber toilets upgrading, some are carrying parts into a dock with some kind of a hilt of a sword. While all this happens, An Apprentice of Magnusson wandered around with a clipboard, checking if all the materials are around.

  


Scientist Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Thats the hilt, 3,475 out of 12,068 parts, Your doing a good job claw guy‚Ä¶ keep it up and maybe your superior promotes you.

  


Laser Upgrader Uber Toilet: Thank you sir.

  


Scientist Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Now which ones are the necessities back on earth‚Ä¶

  


While the two discuss the list, it pans away to the space station to the moon. It fades through the dark side of the moon‚Ä¶ It was normal and prosper untiiilllll-

  


Something crashes in the dark‚Ä¶ Some kind of‚Ä¶ Warship??

https://preview.redd.it/d0jnaxv1ixqe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42763fbb0b6c6fba47591e11d643661e911c9ae1

The Exterior explodes with it's satellite, causing it to release a loud frequency.



The Uber space station absorbed this frequency. It caused distress in the uber space stations across space.



A distress beep appeared on the uber toielts screens.



Uber Scientist: Impact detected‚Ä¶ we have impact confirmed‚Ä¶



Some uber astronomers are stll deciphering what the impact was.



Uber Astronomer: Still unknown if its an astro toilet or another foreign alien life‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/n8uw7o7qixqe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c49c1e86d3180ff388ecf3cc149fa3e887c26e

Uber Scientist: This is a serious matter, we have the royal scientist‚Äôs apprentice on board‚Ä¶ Copy the info and send it straight to him right away‚Ä¶



A holographic screen printed out info in a skibidi language. It was then sent to a drive where an uber engineer takes it and exits the room.

  


30 minutes later, the engineer reaches the stations dock, where the Apprentice Mutant Toilet was observing the supply parts. He reached him out.

  


Engineer Uber Toilet: Sir‚Ä¶ I'm sorry for the interruptions but you need to see this‚Ä¶

  


The scientist inserts the drive in his watch and views the info, he was shocked to see an impact signal on the moon.



  
Apprentice Mutant Toilet: This is not just a normal impact‚Ä¶ this is crash site, the frequency signal is too high to show a passive impact, this thing. It collided with with the moon!

  


Engineer Uber Toilet: Collision course?? This is a big news, we have to inform the whole empire about this and act before something happens in the crash site.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: I had to inform chief about this right now‚Ä¶ give me a sec im def sending this info to mr. Magnusson right away‚Ä¶

>INT - Toilet Empire Territory - eternal darkness (night)

Magnusson gets a message from his apprentice, he gets shocked of the info.

  


It then cuts to his mech arriving in toilet emperor's throne. Toilet emperor is annoyed by his arrival. Magnusson bows to him.

  


Toilet Emperor: What are you doing in this ungodly hour‚Ä¶ I haven't even got my daily light therapy yet!

  


Magnusson: Your highness my apologies for arriving in an unfaithful time, but you might wanna hear this. A designation top secret message from our uber friends in space tells us an unidentified object went to a collision course with the moon. It had an unusual signal and we believe it's an astro warship.

  


Toilet Emperor: Well then, it's a good news. That pesky dolonos must have requested it to invade a part of the earth and failed. I appreciate the ubers for gunning down those astro fools.

  


Magnusson: your highness, the ubers done zero interference for the crash site, it was on the dark side of the moon, a place Uber Toilets never wandered yet.

  


Toilet Emperor: Well then, those astros are not as intelligent and innovative as I thought‚Ä¶ Send a retrieval team to the crash site, i think the skibidi federation is on to it as well, i fear their faction is unpredictable this time‚Ä¶ Those astro samples must be rarer and powerful to rise our might. we need to get to the moon.

>**INT - Uber Toilet Space Station #005 - Eternal Darkness - No sign of day and night.**

Some uber scientists and astronomers gathered around in the space station and talked about the orders of the emperor.



Uber Scientist: We gathered here to talk about an important matter. Our Highness Toilet Emperor has ordered us to retrieve the crash remains before the skibidi federation does.



  
Uber Astronomer: Sir, their technology is still scarce, it would take atleast 3-7 months before they get there‚Ä¶ we have an upper hand.

  


Uber Scientist: And that's what I needed to hear‚Ä¶ I command the astronomers here to perform the operation‚Ä¶ we're going to the moon‚Ä¶

  


Some uber toilets have prepared for the journey to moon. The Scientist Apprentice was given a space suit to join. It then cuts to an uber spaceship igniting and exiting the space station.

  


Some uber scientists watch the rocket venture to the other side of the moon, soon enough they reached the dark side of it and lands though it.



The Apprentice Mutant Toilet is ready to go down the ship.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: We have landed sir‚Ä¶ I am at the foot of the ladder. And step of the land now‚Ä¶ Thats one small step for toiletkind, i wonder why you guys didnt invent legs.

  


Astronomer Uber Toilet: Good job Mr apprentice!! You and your team can now begin your journey‚Ä¶ we just got an unfortunate news for you sir‚Ä¶





Apprentice Mutant Toilet: What is it sir?

  


Astronomer Uber Toilet: Unfortunately since we provided the only size you have which is earth space suit, you have 45 minutes of air time‚Ä¶ And you may not have much on the expedition‚Ä¶

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Its okay, this is enough for a trip‚Ä¶

  


Astronomer Uber Toilet: we wish you goodluck on this‚Ä¶ You got th-

  


Signal interruption‚Ä¶

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Sir?? Sir?? They should really put satellites here‚Ä¶ This place is huge, I should've brought a flag in space if i knew im going here‚Ä¶¬†

  


The mutant leaps on the moon,¬†

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Guys‚Ä¶ we have to go now‚Ä¶

  


Two smaller spaceship uber Toilet gets out of the pod, they nod to him. The Apprentice Mutant grabs onto one of them and they flew through the place until they found the crash site.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Holy skibidi‚Ä¶ that thing is huge‚Ä¶



  
They finally arrived in the crash site, they stopped on what supposed to be the entrance. The apprentice landed on the ground. He finds a broke wall that has collapsing moon dust flowing inside, he slides down with some of the spaceship ubers following by.



Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Are you guys sure this is an astro warship? Wheres the orange guns, where is the levitator? Wheres the head on top of the‚Ä¶



He finds a peculiar thing that seemed to be burried under the moon dust, he unearths it to find a giant glass pod with something inside.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Oh my god, its some kind of a toilet‚Ä¶ but it doesnt have a high tech upgrade, and‚Ä¶ it's toilet looks peculiar. ITS A SQUARE??



Spaceship Uber Toilet: Sir‚Ä¶ this, this seems to be a diffrent kind transport. This place, it doeent look like something astros will use.



Spaceship Uber Toilet #2: What is that?



They saw a tall peculiar box. They thought it was some kind of port-a-potty.



Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Is that‚Ä¶ a port a potty? This thing, its where low class toilet sleeps‚Ä¶ is it‚Ä¶¬†



‚ÄúSkibidi dop dop yes‚Ä¶‚Äù



Apprentice Mutant Toilet: WHAT IS THAT??



The three prepares a circle formation, they look at the place and the mutant knocks on the tall box looking thing.



Apprentice Mutant Toilet: SHOW YOURSELF!! GET OUT OF THERE AND SURRENDER!!



He then realizes its not a box, it had no door‚Ä¶



Apprentice Mutant Toilet: this is not a door, then what is it‚Ä¶

  


Suddenly from the rubble something jumps up‚Ä¶

  


‚ÄúSKIBIDI DOP-U-DO DEE DEE-‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/k8x8bnvlixqe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc506f8d160a2aadfbca0bdb0ada6b4cca3a9c73

Apprentice: OHH GOD OH GOD OH-

  


He tries protecting himself but before he does get hit, he notices the entity freezing solid. He looks at the frozen thing but it gets blasted by the two uber spaceships.

  


Spaceship Uber Toilet: Sir you okay??

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: yeah‚Ä¶ im okay, what is that??

  


He looks at the corpse, he realizes something.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: This is not a toilet‚Ä¶ is it some kind of‚Ä¶ trash can??

  


The two spaceship Uber Toilet looks at each other.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: I think we just found something more than just astros‚Ä¶ this place‚Ä¶ it's larger to explore it in a short amount of time. We have to mark this area to gather it all for reasearch.

  


The spaceship Uber Toilet unleashes a beacon in its system, they went outside and the apprentice Mutant Toilet places it. It glows bright which attracted several uber warships. They all land to the crash site.

  


Meanwhile back at the pod, the apprentice Mutant Toilet calls magnusson. He answers.

  


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Doctor‚Ä¶ you're not gonna believe this‚Ä¶



  
**\[\[Book closes\]\]**

  


Cuckoo Clockman: -Aaaaand‚Ä¶ that is the end of the story for now‚Ä¶ Things are gonna be so tense‚Ä¶ and im afraid that‚Ä¶

  


‚ÄúHey! You've enjoyed narrating my own little storybook huh‚Ä¶‚Äù

  


Zealous enters the room.

  


Cuckoo Clockman: Oh uuuhhhuuh Sir, didn't expect you to be back so soon. Yes we finally unearthed the truth‚Ä¶ Seems like they are gonna act up now‚Ä¶

  


Zealous: Yes they were, and we have a lot to discuss, call the others. It's a Dire Situation.

  


Cuckoo: wait wait wait, you mean all the others?... What are you planning sir?

Parker sat across from Lieutenant Catriona Vaughn in a quiet, high-tech language lab aboard *Fort Solace*. The room was dimly lit, with the glow of the holo-displays casting soft blues and greens over the metal walls. A floating script of Kethrani characters hovered between them, flickering in and out of view as Vaughn controlled the lesson from her side of the table.

But Parker‚Äôs mind wasn‚Äôt on the words. His enhanced senses picked up everything. The faint hum of the ship‚Äôs power core, the subtle fluctuations in the artificial gravity, even the way Vaughn‚Äôs heartbeat shifted slightly every time she leaned closer to correct his pronunciation. She smelled like something warm and clean, a hint of lavender mixed with the sharper scent of the synthetic Star Navy uniforms.

And she was stunning. Vaughn was in her mid-twenties, not much older than some of the junior officers Parker had met, but she might as well have been from another world to him. She had a short auburn haircut just above her collar, with a slight wave that softened the sharp angles of her cheekbones. Green eyes flicked over his face with an intensity that made his pulse stutter for just a second longer than it should.

He knew it was stupid. She was an officer. He was barely a cadet. And yet‚Ä¶ There were fleeting, impossible-to-prove moments where he could have sworn she looked at him the same way, only for an instant. Then it was gone. She shut it down the way a soldier should.

‚ÄúBlaire, focus,‚Äù Vaughn‚Äôs voice snapped him back, and he realized he‚Äôd been staring instead of reading. She raised an eyebrow, one corner of her mouth quirking slightly upward. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôve developed telepathic abilities and are translating the words in your head, I suggest you stop looking at me like I‚Äôm an astrophysics equation and start speaking.‚Äù

Parker flushed, rubbing the back of his neck. Damn, enhanced perception. *‚Äú*Right.‚Äù He cleared his throat and tried again. *‚ÄúKethran‚Äôri dosh-tari‚Ä¶ ech narok valen.‚Äù*

Vaughn tilted her head, considering. ‚ÄúBetter. ‚ÄòA Kethrani warrior never, ‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶never turns their back on battle.‚Äù Parker finished for her, catching the glimmer of approval in her gaze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre picking it up fast.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a compliment or a statement of fact, but it still sent him a small surge of pride. ‚ÄúIt helps when you can hear every change in pitch.‚Äù

Vaughn gave him a knowing look. *‚Äú*You hear language better than most, but speaking is muscle memory, Blaire. It takes practice. You‚Äôll get there.‚Äù

Parker shifted in his seat, feeling the slight strain of his muscles, not from exertion but from something deeper. He was too aware of her. The way her pulse quickened slightly when she leaned in to correct him. The heat of her skin just inches from his own. The way her breath hitched for the briefest second before she pulled back. For a moment, he considered asking her, *Are you feeling this too?*

But then Vaughn straightened, masking whatever had flickered across her face. Her expression became the perfectly measured neutrality of an officer instructing a cadet. ‚ÄúClass dismissed, Cadet.‚Äù

His heart sank a little, but he nodded, masking his own disappointment just as quickly.

As he stood to leave, he hesitated. *‚Äú*Lieutenant?‚Äù

Vaughn looked up. ‚ÄúHmm? Thanks. For helping me with this.‚Äù

Something flickered in her gaze again. Something guarded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a quick study, Parker.‚Äù

And then, just as he was about to turn and walk away, she added, almost too quiet for normal ears to hear, ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù

Parker paused, glancing back at her, but Vaughn was already focused on her terminal as if she hadn‚Äôt said anything at all. He left the room feeling like an entire conversation was hanging in the air that neither of them had actually spoken.

¬†

\~\*\~

¬†

Parker stood at the edge of the vast training complex deep inside *Halcyon 5*, watching as a set of massive blast doors rolled open to reveal the test chamber. It looked more like a proving ground than anything else‚Äîa fusion of a fighter pilot‚Äôs wind tunnel, a weightlifting station built for giants, and a reinforced testing range.

Commander Jean-Michel Moreau stood beside him, arms crossed. His slate-gray uniform was crisp despite the sheer bulk of his build. Even without metahuman enhancements, Moreau had the look of someone who could take a man apart with his bare hands. He had a sharp, angular face with deep lines that spoke of years of combat. His voice was rough, and authoritative‚Äîhe was a man who commanded respect without having to ask for it.

‚ÄúCadet Blaire,‚Äù Moreau said, rolling the word cadet off his tongue as if testing it for the first time. ‚ÄúBefore we begin, do you know why the Star Navy doesn‚Äôt rely on metahumans?‚Äù

Parker hesitated. He had heard the statistics. He knew that despite rare and powerful metahumans, the Confederacy didn‚Äôt structure its forces around them the way some alien races did.

‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt enough of us?‚Äù Parker guessed.

Moreau nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of it. Less than one percent of humanity develops powers, and only a fraction of those have the power, discipline, or inclination to join the military. The other reason? Not every bloc on Earth trusts metahumans. The Asian Confederation, minus Korea and Japan, still believes metahumans are an unstable element. The North African Coalition tolerates them but refuses to integrate them into their command structures. The South American Union outright bans them from military service.‚Äù

Parker frowned. ‚ÄúSo what does that mean for us?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means that while the Confederacy acknowledges your usefulness, we don‚Äôt *rely* on you.‚Äù Moreau‚Äôs eyes locked onto Parker‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIf this war is going to be won, it will be won by starsailors and soldiers, not supermen.‚Äù That stung a little, but Parker understood the logic.

Moreau clapped his hands together, the sharp sound echoing in the chamber. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs see what you can do.‚Äù

The first test was flight. Parker stepped onto the reinforced launch pad as Moreau and a team of technicians observed from behind a thick glass panel. The chamber‚Äôs vast expanse was a ring that stretched nearly a hundred kilometers in circumference, complete with a wind resistance field and gravitational stabilizers.

‚ÄúTake off. See what your top speed is,‚Äù Moreau instructed through the comms. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll track your acceleration. No unnecessary energy discharges‚Äîjust raw velocity.‚Äù

Parker took a breath, bracing himself. Then, with a flex of his legs, he *launched*.

The acceleration was immediate, sending him surging forward. The walls blurred, the air hummed around him, and a pressure wave built in his wake. Parker grit his teeth as he pushed harder, feeling the resistance of the wind barrier pressing back against him.

*0.7 Mach.*

*0.8 Mach.*

*0.9 Mach.*

The moment he neared the transonic threshold, he could *feel* it‚Äîthe way the air thickened around him, the faint halo of condensed moisture forming in his wake. Then‚Äî

**BOOM.**

The shockwave rattled the walls. Parker shot forward, riding the ripple of compressed air, his body vibrating from its force. Through the comms, Moreau muttered, ‚Äú*Merde*‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs breaking Mach 1 already.‚Äù

Parker grinned, adrenaline rushing through him. He coasted for a few seconds before slowing down and coming to a controlled hover near the observation deck. He barely even felt winded. Moreau smirked slightly. ‚ÄúNot bad, Cadet.‚Äù

Next was the gravity chamber. The testing room shifted, and suddenly, Parker found himself in a space filled with massive reinforced weights‚Äîhuge slabs of ultra-dense alloys. A *normal* metahuman strongman could lift one or two of them. The room‚Äôs artificial gravity began to *increase* in slow increments.

‚ÄúOne ton‚Ä¶ two tons‚Ä¶‚Äù Moreau watched the monitors as Parker moved from weight to weight.

By the time they hit forty tons, Parker‚Äôs muscles were burning, his breath heavy. He adjusted his stance, gripping the enormous alloy slab and forcing himself to lift it off the ground. His arms shook, his bones groaned under the pressure, but he didn‚Äôt stop. He could do this.

‚ÄúHold it for ten seconds,‚Äù Moreau ordered.

Parker clenched his jaw and *held*, feeling the weight press into every fiber of his being. He counted in his head, pushing through the strain.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Eight‚Ä¶ nine‚Ä¶ ten. That‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

Parker let the weight crash down, breathing heavily. His uniform was damp with sweat, but the grin on his face was undeniable.

Moreau scribbled something on his datapad. ‚ÄúForty tons. You‚Äôre no lightweight, and you‚Äôre not even fully grown yet.‚Äù

Parker cracked his knuckles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get stronger.‚Äù

Moreau actually chuckled at that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt it.‚Äù

The next two tests were more intense. The first involved Parker‚Äôs durability. Strapped to a specialized testing frame, Parker stood his ground as automated turrets fired high-intensity plasma bolts at him. His instincts screamed at him to dodge, but he forced himself to *take* the hits. The first few blasts barely tickled. Then, the power levels increased.

His uniform was scorched in places. His skin stung. But he wasn‚Äôt seriously hurt.

Moreau studied the readouts. ‚ÄúGood energy resistance, but your ability to absorb and redirect energy is still unfocused.‚Äù

‚ÄúWorking on it,‚Äù Parker muttered.

The final test was *vacuum exposure*. Parker stood inside the pressure-sealed chamber as the atmosphere was drained away. He expected to feel panic, but instead‚Äîhe felt nothing. No burning in his lungs, no suffocating tightness. It was‚Ä¶ peaceful.

He drifted briefly, staring at the stars through the observation window before the pressure was restored.

When he stepped out, Moreau was watching him carefully. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt panic.‚Äù

Parker shrugged. ‚ÄúFelt kinda nice, actually.‚Äù

Moreau exhaled as if processing something. ‚ÄúYour physiology is adapting faster than I expected.‚Äù

Parker wiped his forehead, taking in the full weight of everything they‚Äôd tested today. He was fast. Strong. Resistant to energy. And he could survive in a vacuum. But he still had a long way to go.

Moreau seemed to pick up on his thoughts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got power, Blaire. But power without control? Without training? It‚Äôs wasted potential.‚Äù

Parker nodded. ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù

Moreau closed his datapad. ‚ÄúNow, you train. Because sooner or later, you won‚Äôt be in a testing chamber. You‚Äôll be in the middle of a battlefield.‚Äù

And somehow, Parker knew he was right.

¬†

\~\*\~

The lounge aboard Fort Solace was unusually quiet this evening, the usual hum of conversation replaced by the soft murmur of the ship‚Äôs life-support systems. The faint scent of recycled air, a hint of synthetic citrus meant to keep everything from smelling too sterile, mixed with the ever-present metallic tang of the starbase‚Äôs interior. Parker stood near one of the viewports, the swirling tapestry of Halcyon 5‚Äôs atmosphere stretching below.

His body still thrummed with residual energy from the latest training session with Moreau‚Äîhis muscles ached pleasantly from exertion, and a faint static charge lingered in his fingertips from the energy absorption drills. His flight suit clung to his skin, damp from the sweat that hadn‚Äôt yet evaporated in the climate-controlled air.

Parker closed his eyes, slowing his breathing. His enhanced senses picked up the subtle creaks in the base‚Äôs bulkheads, the rhythmic hum of power conduits beneath the floor, and the distant thud-thud of someone approaching down the passageway. He didn‚Äôt have to turn to know who it was.

Catriona Vaughn.

She had a distinctive presence‚Äîher footsteps were smooth and deliberate but not as heavy as the seasoned officers who had spent years marching in formation. There was a scent, too, something faint but distinctly hers, a mix of fabric softener, the synthetic leather of her uniform, and a whisper of something floral, something warm.

Parker inhaled deeply as she entered the lounge. His pulse quickened before he even looked at her. *Why does she always have that effect on me?*

She wore her standard uniform, but the way it hugged her frame, the way the light caught the deep auburn of her hair, it was impossible for Parker not to notice. For the past few weeks, he‚Äôd been *certain* that she had noticed him too. The way she looked at him when she thought he wasn‚Äôt paying attention. The small pauses before she spoke. There was a slight hitch in her breath when he got too close. It had been subtle, but it had been there.

She approached him, arms crossed, a look of mild exasperation on her face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pushing too hard,‚Äù she said without preamble.

Parker smirked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the point of training, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Vaughn sighed and shook her head. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between training and burning yourself out**.**‚Äù

She reached out, fingers grazing his wrist‚Äîjust for a second, just long enough for Parker to feel the warmth of her skin against his. His breath caught. The touch sent a shiver up his arm, a burst of something that had nothing to do with metahuman energy and everything to do with the way her eyes locked onto his, stormy and uncertain.

He saw it then. The hesitation. The flicker of something behind her professional mask. For weeks, they had been dancing around this**.** The quiet moments after lessons, where their conversations stretched a little too long. The way she sometimes sat just close enough that their knees almost touched. The way her pupils dilated just slightly when she looked at him. And now? He was sure.

He turned toward her, and this time, she didn‚Äôt step back. For a heartbeat, neither of them moved. The lounge around them seemed to blur, fading into the periphery. Parker‚Äôs enhanced senses drowned in the rush of her nearness, the steady beat of her pulse, the faint warmth of her breath against his cheek. He could close the distance. Just a little more. Just‚Äî

Vaughn‚Äôs fingers tightened for the briefest moment, then she stepped back. The connection snapped like a taut wire. Parker blinked, still caught in the space between what had almost happened and what hadn‚Äôt.

Vaughn exhaled, rubbing her temple before looking at him with something between regret and frustration. ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt happen,‚Äù she said quietly.

Parker‚Äôs jaw clenched. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù His voice was low but steady. ‚ÄúI know you feel something.‚Äù

She closed her eyes for a second as if steadying herself. When she opened them again, the storm was still there, but it was controlled, locked down behind the rigid structure of her discipline. ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù she admitted. That alone sent Parker‚Äôs heart into overdrive. But then she shook her head. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù

He frowned. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

She sighed. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm your supervisor. Your teacher. Even if the military didn‚Äôt frown on it, it‚Äôs an abuse of power for me to get involved with a subordinate.‚Äù

Parker‚Äôs throat went dry, but she wasn‚Äôt done.

‚ÄúAnd beyond that?‚Äù She took a deep breath. ‚ÄúParker, you‚Äôre fifteen.‚Äù

The words hit like a shockwave. He stiffened. He knew how old he was, of course. But everything about his life, his training, the war, and the things he had survived made him feel so much older.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said, voice tinged with frustration. ‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs not that simple. You‚Äôve seen what I can do. I‚Äôm not a kid.‚Äù

She sighed sharply**.** ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just not a kid, Parker. You‚Äôre *you*. You‚Äôre a Class X metahuman. You‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs going to change the course of this war. That‚Äôs a lot of weight on your shoulders. But you can‚Äôt just skip ahead.‚Äù

He clenched his fists. ‚ÄúSo what, I‚Äôm just supposed to ignore this? Pretend it‚Äôs not real?‚Äù

Vaughn‚Äôs expression softened, and that was the worst part. Because she wasn‚Äôt rejecting him in a way that made it easy to be angry.

She lifted a hand as if to reach for him again, then curled her fingers back, keeping the distance between them. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you, Parker. And I don‚Äôt want to ruin you either.‚Äù

His breath shuddered slightly. She did feel it. This wasn‚Äôt just in his head. But she was right. If anyone found out, she‚Äôd be the one to suffer for it.

After a long moment, she forced a small smile. ‚ÄúListen. I think you‚Äôre going to be incredible someday. I really do. But right now? Focus on being a starsailor. Focus on being a hero. Not this.‚Äù

Parker swallowed, forcing the emotions down. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it? You‚Äôre just cutting this off before it starts?‚Äù

She hesitated. Then nodded. ‚ÄúI have to.‚Äù

The weight in his chest was heavier than the forty tons he had lifted earlier.

Finally, he exhaled, looking away toward the viewport, the stars stretched out before them. The war, the universe, all of it seemed so damn big.

Vaughn‚Äôs voice softened. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt lose yourself in this war, Parker. You‚Äôre more than your powers.‚Äù

He nodded, but the ache in his chest didn‚Äôt fade. As she turned and walked away, he flexed his fingers, still able to feel the ghost of her touch. One step forward. Two steps back. And now, Parker wasn‚Äôt sure where he stood anymore.

Parker kept his eyes locked on the viewport long after Vaughn had disappeared down the corridor. The stars blurred, not because of movement but because of the tight knot in his chest that refused to loosen.

The lounge was still mostly empty, save for a few distant murmurs from off-duty crew members further down the room. The air smelled of strong brewed coffee and the faint, ever-present tang of recycled oxygen. His fingers curled into fists, then relaxed. He could still feel the ghost of Vaughn‚Äôs touch lingering on his skin like an ember that refused to go cold.

He barely registered the steady clomp of boots approaching. Halverson.

The lieutenant didn‚Äôt say anything at first. Just walked up beside Parker and rested his arms on the metal lip of the viewport, staring down at Halcyon V below.

For a long moment, there was only silence between them, the vast, spinning world below casting a faint glow against the lounge‚Äôs interior.

Then.

‚ÄúShe let you down easy, huh?‚Äù

Parker exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. ‚ÄúYou were watching?‚Äù

Halverson shook his head. ‚ÄúNah. I saw her walk in here and figured something was about to happen. Heard enough when I came back.‚Äù He gave Parker a sidelong glance. ‚ÄúI take it that wasn‚Äôt how you wanted that conversation to go?‚Äù

Parker huffed out something between a bitter chuckle and a sigh. ‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù

Halverson grunted. ‚ÄúWell, kid. Welcome to heartbreak. It‚Äôs a bitch.‚Äù

Parker ran a hand through his hair, letting the silence stretch out again before muttering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù

Halverson smirked. ‚ÄúNothing ever is.‚Äù He let the words hang in the air for a moment before adding, ‚ÄúEspecially when it comes to women. Ignore her advice.‚Äù

Parker scoffed. ‚ÄúSo what, you‚Äôre about to tell me to keep trying? That if I just hang in there, she‚Äôll change her mind?‚Äù

Halverson let out a short laugh. ‚ÄúHell no. She said no. You‚Äôre not gonna be one of those guys that can‚Äôt take a hint, right?‚Äù

Parker turned to him, his expression serious. ‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù

Halverson nodded, seemingly satisfied with that answer. ‚ÄúGood. Didn‚Äôt think you were that kind of guy.‚Äù

Parker looked back out at the planet below. ‚ÄúThen why‚Äôd you tell me to ignore her advice?‚Äù

Halverson straightened, rolling his shoulders before turning to lean against the viewport‚Äôs edge. ‚ÄúBecause I wasn‚Äôt talking about her. I was talking about what she said about you ‚Äònot losing yourself in the training.‚Äô‚Äù

Parker frowned.

Halverson continued his voice even. ‚ÄúRight now, you‚Äôve got two choices, Blaire. You can sit here, licking your wounds, thinking about what could‚Äôve been. Or you can take all that frustration, that energy, and put it into something that actually matters.‚Äù

He tilted his head toward Parker. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a gift, kid. You‚Äôre already a force to be reckoned with. But you‚Äôre not done growing yet. Not even close. Vaughn‚Äôs smart‚Äîshe knows that. She knows you‚Äôre gonna be someone big. But right now? She‚Äôs seeing you as the kid you are, not the man you‚Äôre gonna be.‚Äù

Parker clenched his jaw, staring at his own faint reflection in the viewport.

‚ÄúFocus on your grind,‚Äù Halverson said simply. ‚ÄúTrain harder. Learn faster. Get stronger. Become the kind of man she‚Äôll regret walking away from for the rest of her life.‚Äù

Parker inhaled slowly, then let the breath out. He hadn‚Äôt really thought about it like that.

Halverson pushed off the viewport and clapped a firm hand on Parker‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be fine, kid. Hell, give it a couple years‚Äîwomen like Vaughn will be lining up for you.‚Äù

Parker finally let out a breath that felt like it had been trapped in his chest for the past hour. He turned to Halverson and smirked. ‚ÄúIs this your way of telling me you used to be a scrawny little recruit who got turned down by a hot lieutenant?‚Äù

Halverson chuckled, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNot quite. But I *do* know a thing or two about women and regret.‚Äù He glanced toward the doorway where Vaughn had left and shrugged. ‚ÄúThat one? She‚Äôs gonna be kicking herself in a couple of years. Mark my words.‚Äù

Parker‚Äôs smirk faded slightly, but there was something new there now‚Äîdetermination. He straightened, rolling his shoulders. ‚ÄúGuess I better make sure she does.‚Äù

Halverson grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit. Now, come on. I think Moreau‚Äôs got another training session lined up for you tomorrow.‚Äù

Parker sighed but didn‚Äôt argue. Because for the first time since Vaughn had walked away, he felt like he had a purpose again.",3,1742949276.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I have always been the type of person that when going through something, I NEED to talk it out. Venting for me is a huge release of stress, especially when it‚Äôs over coffee with a close friend or on a phone call w/ friends or family. Recently my friend (26F), called me out on how discouraging and annoying it is for me to vent, and for her to listen and give advice, and for me to come back and vent again, and again, without taking her advice or putting it into action. The reality is I just like talking my issues out! And I really don‚Äôt seek out advice. But she is completely correct in this situation. It was a bit sobering to see how I‚Äôve been acting and how upsetting that can be in someone else‚Äôs shoes who actually cares for me. 
Now this post I am looking for advice. 

Essentially I have been on and off with my BF for about 3 years now. We started dating when I was 20 and he was 24 and immediately we had to go long distance due to my job, though I was able to fly to him every month for a week or so. He visited me once in the previous city due to his work schedule. 

Long distance was hard and we both were unfaithful. I met a friend (26F mentioned previously) and moved in with her in my previous city, and we partied ALOT. I was aware my bf was cheating at the time so stupidly I did the same, as a way of feeling ‚Äúeven‚Äù or whatever. We both confessed and we were OFF for a while.

We get together, I go on a birthday trip with my friend, and he is unfaithful. I stupidly do the same. We‚Äôre OFF again. We argued a lot during this time and a lot of blocking/unblocking/deleting/etc‚Ä¶. Petty things. Everytime a situation would occur I would reach out to friends and family for advice. Obviously I was met with advice to leave him TF alone, and to work on myself. They are completely correct and I did take a bit of time to be alone and not date or party for a while and distance myself. 

Eventually Ramadan comes around and my bf, ex at the time, reaches out to let me know his family is coming to visit and would like to meet me. This is mind boggling to me because we had a horrible relationship and we were not together at the time. I give in because I‚Äôve spoken to his family before and I really do like them. 

 Obviously my family are NOT fans of him due to what I‚Äôve told them. My friends are NOT fans either and had asked me at one point to not mention him again. When I do vent, I will admit I left a lot of the parts out where I do a bad thing, and focuses and emphasized a lot more on what he did, even though my friends and family would tell me it‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs all him, etc. 

I meet his family and we get back together. I eventually get a transfer to the city he‚Äôs living in and I move to an apartment by myself away from the friend I lived with in the previous city, meaning less partying. I matured; self reflected and swore I‚Äôd never do stupid things again. 
I believe he matured, having not seen his family for 4 years, having them fly in really made me notice he was very lonely and depressed this whole time. I noticed that with the both of us, we work a lot better when we‚Äôre together, and are a little stupid when we‚Äôre apart, because we‚Äôre so frustrated with not being able to see eachother we go off again and try and fill the void almost with other people (again! Stupid. I know but I‚Äôm being honest). I am enjoying being with him again and we‚Äôve recently, within the next few months decided to live together. He‚Äôs always pushed it on me to move in with him but was with his sister for a long time, and his apartment was far too small for 3 people. Luckily now his sister is moving and as much as I love her we can both move in together as a couple.

Issue is nobody in my life knows we‚Äôre back together besides my family. I am at fault here. My family knows and are warming up to it, considering they‚Äôve seen our maturing and how essentially when we‚Äôre together, not forced to be distanced or away from eachother, we really work well. But my family also can‚Äôt exactly leave me for this decision.

Now my friends have explicitly said they will NOT support this relationship NOR warm up to him ever. At this point in time my friends believe we are broken up and I do not ever mention his name or talk about anything about eachother anymore since my friend told me how irritating it is to vent. I want to tell my friends. I know they will judge me harshly and I‚Äôll be looked at as weak here and maybe I am! But I don‚Äôt want to lose them. Me and my bf are planning to move in and it‚Äôll be great to be with him but I still need friends as well. How do I bring this up? How do I accept that people could leave me for this? I want to tell them how much I‚Äôve changed and him as well but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be met with open arms.

Also my fault, HE doesn‚Äôt know that nobody knows besides my family. He believes my friends are aware, including the friend I used to live with, who he butted heads with, because she tends to attract a lot of attention and a lot of the time leaves me in situations where I‚Äôm left with men with parties and feeding me drinks (part of why we had to stop living together). 

The news is gonna explode eventually especially if I‚Äôm living with him. What to do? I know I suck a lot in this but I didn‚Äôt want to sugarcoat anything ",0,1742949207.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

This isolation is both a blessing and a curse. If you're looking for seclusion and pure relaxation, it's perfect. If you want to explore the island's hotspots, be prepared for longer drives. There's virtually nothing within walking distance of the resort.

Room: We splurged on a 5-bedroom residence with two private pools, a full kitchen, and a bar area. This was a fantastic decision for our large group. The villa was perched high on the hill, offering stunning views of the Gulf of Thailand and the resort. Be warned, the hills are steep, so you'll rely heavily on the resort's buggy service. The bedrooms are similar to the standard villas, but the residence's expansive living spaces and dual pools were a game-changer. Bathrooms were spacious, though the closets were surprisingly small. A quirky design choice was the lack of doors on the toilets beside the main bathroom door. The main pool in the residence was over 50 feet long, heated, and offered breathtaking views.

Service: The service here is truly exceptional, as you'd expect from a top-tier Four Seasons in Southeast Asia. The staff is incredibly attentive and personalized. By the end of our first day, most knew our names and preferences. One member of our party has a severe shellfish allergy, and every restaurant on property was aware of it, mentioning it proactively at each meal. Our two butlers were outstanding, available 24/7, and fulfilled every request, from morning coffee to poolside cocktails. The General Manager and Resort Manager were highly visible and engaged, even joining us for villa happy hours and birthday celebrations. Buggy service was generally prompt, though occasional waits were necessary. Each group got their own buggy, which was nice.

Food: Food was good, but not quite reaching ""amazing"" status. The Thai restaurant was beautiful and offered themed nights, including a buffet with a local show and a curry night. Breakfast was excellent, but the buffet selection was a bit limited compared to other Four Seasons properties (I'd rate it 7/10). The a la carte menu was a plus. Poolside/Pla Pla lunch was very good, but the menu leaned heavily towards dinner entrees rather than light lunch options.

Overall Impression: The Four Seasons Koh Samui is a phenomenal resort that lives up to its reputation as one of the best in Thailand and Southeast Asia. The service is impeccable, the villas are luxurious (especially the residences), and the setting is breathtaking. If you're looking for a secluded, high-end getaway with top-notch service and don't mind the isolated location and a few minor food quibbles, I highly recommend it. For a large family or group, the five bedroom residence is absolutely worth the upgrade.

TL;DR: Amazing service, luxurious villas with great views, isolated location, food good but not mind-blowing. Highly recommend for a relaxing, high-end stay.",21,1742948651.0,chubbytravel,10,1.0,False

A few words in tribute to our beloved cat, Conan Kitty a.k.a. The Best Kitty in the City.

Born on the mean streets of Arcadia, then relocated to Pasadena Humane Society, where he found us on one incredible August afternoon. He meowed at us from across the room and caught our attention. We loved his big ears, his big paws, his crooked tail, and the markings that looked like a monocle around his left eye.

We took him home to our little apartment in Burbank on August 25th, 2013, and our lives were forever changed for the better.  Immediately, we were impressed by his adventurous spirit - he loved exploring and getting into everything he could, even busting through the window screen a couple of times. He loved galloping across our one-bedroom apartment and barreling into the blinds, which sounded like a horse in a bowling alley.

He was very handsome, regal, dignified, refined, and debonair.  He was very talkative and very friendly with everyone he came in contact with. He would jog up to the front door and meow along the way to greet us when we got home from work. He loved looking out the window at night and meowing ‚Äúhello‚Äù to the neighborhood.

His favorite hobbies included sleeping, bird watching, catching mice, and licking coffee cups and cardboard boxes. He loved his spot on top of the couch, as evidenced by the permanent indentation in our couch cushion. Best of all, he loved spending time cuddling with his mom and dad, purring, drooling, and making biscuits.

Unfortunately, he was recently diagnosed with lymphoma, and he's been slowing down over the past few weeks and months. 

He's been an ever-present force in our lives for the past eleven and a half years, and every second with him has been a true blessing.

Thank you, Conan. We love you more than words can say.

I‚Äôm definitely having an anxiety flare up, I think I get them on and off every couple weeks-months. Last week I went to work and I felt so dissociative, like everyone‚Äôs voices were echos and it was freaking me out which resulted in a panick attack. Ever since then I‚Äôve been so anxious, I‚Äôve been feeling weird at work (dissociative, light headed, not fully being able to focus, not feeling quite there), but when I get home I feel so much worse. My heart feels like it‚Äôs fluttering, I feel shaky, super light headed, and kinda like my brain is being squeezed lol. It‚Äôs so hard to explain in full detail correctly. But I think I had a panick attack again today at work, I really tried to push through it and I made it through after maybe an hour. I think my job stresses me tf out like I‚Äôm completely fine on the weekends until it gets closer to Monday and then I start to stress out. I‚Äôve been having trouble sleeping, not being able to fall asleep until after 12am and constantly wake up and go back to sleep over and over again. I drink energy drinks or coffee in the AM because I feel so tired. If I stop drinking those, would I feel a lot better? Breathing techniques don‚Äôt seem to help, honestly just make it worse and make me feel like my chest is getting tighter. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore, I feel crazy.

As my last novel waits in the query trenches, I'm trying to apply what I learned from it and decided to get the query/first 300 for this WIP down before I get toooooo far into drafting. The 85k is an estimate based on my current outline, but I don't plan on going outside of acceptable genre standards.

I'm currently least confident about the third paragraph. As (hopefully) hinted on in June's paragraph, her reason for avoiding love is because it's difficult to date while chronically ill, and I'm not sure how to work in her shift from avoidant to open based on the cafe's eventual success and her accompanying boost in self-confidence while still keeping the word count reasonable. I'm not sure if it's enough to focus solely on Oliver's reason to avoid love.

Also, I am halfway through my comps and \*think\* they fit, but if someone knows better than me and they're actually way off, feel free to let me know haha! Major thank you to anyone willing to give feedback. :)

Dear \[AGENT\],

When June Connor‚Äôs estranged father passes, she inherits his beloved cat caf√© and attached apartment in Chicago. After another breakup blamed on her chronic illness, it‚Äôs the perfect opportunity to focus on herself and prove her capability. Sure, the cafe is hemorrhaging money, but her savings will keep it afloat‚Äîfor now. However, if she can‚Äôt turn a profit by September, she must sell, leaving the cats and herself without a home. June‚Äôs overexerting tendencies catapult her toward burnout.¬†

After securing a competitive position at a prestigious academy in Boston, school counselor Oliver Green is in Chicago for one last summer. As a favor for a colleague, he takes Finn, a troubled high schooler and former regular in his office, under his wing. Seeing his former self echoed in the teen, Oliver is desperate to nurture Finn‚Äôs interest in animals and show him a future worth believing in as a teacher once did for him. When he discovers June‚Äôs caf√©, it‚Äôs just the community Finn needs.¬†

With June desperate for help, she and Oliver form a pact: if Finn can shadow her and the caf√©'s vet for the summer, Oliver will help get the caf√© back on its feet until he moves. Their pact said nothing about getting attached, but between wrangling cats and watching Finn and the caf√© flourish, June and Oliver are drawn together like cats to catnip. As summer fades into fall, Oliver is torn between the promising new start he dreamed of in Boston or Chicago, where June, Finn, and the community he never expected to build await.¬†

THE THREE-MONTH PACT is a dual-POV contemporary adult romance with upmarket appeal, complete at 85,000 words. It combines the heartfelt romance and self-growth in Carley Fortune‚Äôs *Meet Me at the Lake* with the time limit and found family aspects in Abby Jimenez‚Äôs *Just For the Summer.* Fans of Chloe Liese will appreciate the disability representation.

I have POTS like June and wanted to write a novel where disability and success intersect. My work was published in (small litmag). I live in Chicago and wrangle two cats of my own.

Warmly,¬†¬†

**First 300:**

**Chapter One**

**June**

**Three Months Until Failure**

Peter bats over an open bag of kibble and scampers off just as the health inspector chooses to approach. Based on her expression, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting good news. ‚ÄúBad timing, huh?‚Äù I say, grabbing a broom. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the verdict?‚Äù¬†

She doesn‚Äôt return my smile. ‚ÄúMiss Conner, we have a couple things to address.‚Äù¬†

No one begins a positive conversation with those words. I push back a wave of dizziness, leaning on the broom and ignoring my spiking heart rate. Really wish I hadn't forgotten my meds today. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to replace your furniture.‚Äù She gestures to our lounge, where approximately a dozen cats and three customers sit in old couches and armchairs with upholstery long scratched to shreds. ‚ÄúCloth harbors germs. I‚Äôll have to fine you if you don‚Äôt replace these with sanitizable surfaces within two weeks.‚Äù¬†

At this point, I‚Äôm positive my pulse is visibly jumping in my throat. My savings had enough to keep this place going for a measly four months‚Äîbuying all new furniture? Make it three. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I say, feeling absolutely not okay. ‚ÄúUnderstandable.‚Äù Dad left this place in shambles, and it‚Äôs a wonder it wasn‚Äôt closed down before he passed. ‚ÄúIs there anything else?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI understand the previous owner marketed this place as a cat *caf√©*.‚Äù She glances around, highlighting the glaring lack of coffee and baked goods. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre planning on serving food or drinks, they need to be made in an area entirely separate from the cats. We‚Äôll be checking in periodically to make sure you‚Äôre complying with health code.‚Äù¬†

So my finances are taking a major hit, and there‚Äôs no feasible way to put the ‚Äúcaf√©‚Äù in ‚Äúcat caf√©‚Äù unless I set up Dad‚Äôs old coffee maker in the laundry room. Something tells me that wouldn‚Äôt fly with customers or the health department.",2,1742948523.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

Typing with that clunky on-screen keyboard feels like I‚Äôm chiseling words into stone with a dull spoon. I distinctly remember a time when you could just use your phone as a keyboard for PlayStation consoles, and it was glorious. Back in the PS4 days, I‚Äôd whip out my phone, connect it through the app, and bang out messages like it was nothing. So, naturally, I went to look it up because I couldn‚Äôt recall exactly how to set it up on the PS5. I figured it‚Äôd be a quick Google search, a couple of taps, and I‚Äôd be back in business.



But no. Oh no. I dig into it, and apparently, as of some update a year or so ago, that feature is gone. Dead. Vanished. You can‚Äôt use your phone as a keyboard anymore! What kind of backwards, boneheaded move is this? Who on the PlayStation staff sat in a meeting, raised their hand, and said, ‚ÄúYou know what? Let‚Äôs take away a perfectly good feature that people actually liked and force them to suffer through controller typing again‚Äù? I need names. I need to know which genius thought this was a brilliant idea because they deserve to be fired or at least demoted to cleaning the office coffee machine for eternity. This wasn‚Äôt just a bad decision; it was a horrible decision, a slap in the face to anyone who‚Äôs ever had to type out a full sentence with a DualSense controller.



Seriously, why would they ditch something so useful? The PS4 had the Second Screen feature in the PlayStation app, and it worked like a charm. Now, on the PS5, I‚Äôm stuck here, fumbling through the alphabet like I‚Äôm decoding a secret message with a broken cipher wheel. I even tried the Remote Play app workaround people talk about where you can technically use your phone‚Äôs keyboard but it‚Äôs a hassle. I‚Äôve got to connect my phone, deal with potential lag, type my message, then switch back to the controller on my TV. It‚Äôs not smooth, it‚Äôs not convenient, and half the time it feels like I‚Äôm fighting the system just to say ‚ÄúGG‚Äù to someone. Compare that to the old days when I could just pull up my phone and type without missing a beat. It‚Äôs like Sony took a step forward with the PS5‚Äôs fancy graphics and then took three steps back with basic quality of life features.



And don‚Äôt get me started on how this isn‚Äôt even a problem on other platforms. Xbox still lets you use your phone as a keyboard through their app, and it works fine! Even Nintendo‚Äôs got some mobile integration that makes sense. But Sony? Nope, they decided we don‚Äôt deserve nice things anymore. I shouldn‚Äôt have to buy a separate USB keyboard just to chat in God Eater Resurrection my phone‚Äôs right here, fully capable, and gathering dust because of this nonsense. Whoever greenlit this change clearly doesn‚Äôt play games themselves, or they‚Äôd know how infuriating it is to peck out messages one letter at a time while the loading screen‚Äôs already fading away. Fix this, Sony. Bring back the phone keyboard option, or at least give us a good reason why you thought this was okay because right now, it feels like you‚Äôre punishing us for no reason.",0,1742947826.0,playstation,3,0.29,False

Once the last monologue is done, I'll add it to the manuscript then I'll have to go back to edit it all together. I'm quite happy with myself. Tired but happy.

It is snowing on and off again. It never stays but it is a little demoralizing whenever it falls from the sky. It is spring now. Can we move on to the flowers now? Or at least the showers.

I lost my job when I returned to work after surgery (redundancy) and now can‚Äôt find another because I can‚Äôt get through the day without feeling drunk from the fatigue, how am I meant to work let alone in a role that pays what I was making before and earn what I need to? I have to ‚Äúsave myself‚Äù for anything social (even a coffee with a friend) and even then I‚Äôm smashed for days after. 

I‚Äôve had blood tests on blood tests I‚Äôve the past 6 months, the doctors don‚Äôt want to do anything with me other than tell me I shouldn‚Äôt be fatigued. (Great, I‚Äôll just stop shall I?)

I am beyond frustrated at this point. I‚Äôm 28 and have a mortgage to pay. I live by myself, everything money wise is on me and my savings will only keep my head above water for so long. 

I‚Äôm really starting to feel desperate. My eating is good, my sleep is sporadic (I cycle through insomnia, but even on a good nights sleep I still feel like I‚Äôve been hit by a truck), I‚Äôve been through loads of therapy and have had OH support to get me back into work for 2hrs a day (before I was made redundant). 

I just can‚Äôt seem to do anything, and the one thing I really can‚Äôt accept is that this CFS is not from something underlying. And even if it is, then what? I lose my house? Everything I‚Äôve worked for through my sweat and tears to get just for it to all be taken away? 

I‚Äôm just at my wits end, I‚Äôve got supportive friends and family. They get it when I say I‚Äôm too tired. But how long will that last for? How am I meant to function in a capitalist society when I can‚Äôt work?

So, there is this guy in my class (let‚Äôs call him O) I‚Äôm causally hooking up with (well was‚Ä¶.idk) and we‚Äôre in the same project group. The first time I hung out with him and his friend, they cooked me pasta and his friend (let‚Äôs call him M) said what do you think of my O? He‚Äôs kinda shy and you should ask to hang out sometime. 
I did ask him to come over to my house and we hooked up. 

He asked me out for dinner or coffee sometimes, and I intially rejected him and I made it clear that I was interested in something casual and that I don‚Äôt have time to date people. And then he was like I agree, and we went out on dates occasionally and hooked up. Eventually, I noticed that he didn‚Äôt really initiate things and made me do all the work in the relationship and I called him out for it, and he was like let‚Äôs just talk about it. On one of our dinner dates, we talked about marriage and I said I don‚Äôt see myself getting married and he said ‚Äòwell what am I doing here then?‚Äô (He apparently says this was a joke? I don‚Äôt believe him.) He always stayed over everytime we hooked up and held hands and cuddled. I tried to communicate and when it didn‚Äôt seem like he was going to change I blocked him. 

However, I got horny again, and I talked to him (only to hook up tbh). And he was like look, I felt like you were catching feelings (because I asked him if he was interested in continuing to be friends post graduation or if he was interested in a relationship). I only said that because he said that weird shit about marriage. And then he said - he was spending too much time with me and he was deprioritizing his other work for it. That apparently us hooking up everyday, taking naps was ‚Äòtoo boyfriend energy‚Äô for him. I called him out again and I said - it‚Äôs not my problem if you can‚Äôt act like an adult. Are you fucking insane? Why would I date you? Why would I push for causal if I wanted to date you? Then he immediately backpedaled and said - I‚Äôm sorry I should have communicated better that‚Äôs on me. What the fuck is going on? 


TLDR : Situationship has poor boundaries can‚Äôt tell if he caught feelings or what. I literally just want to hookup and bounce what is this dude. 

Edit: Just because two people cuddle or talk post-hookup doesn‚Äôt mean one person owes emotional management to the other. I stated my boundaries clearly. Anyone suggesting otherwise is ignoring context.

These are the words I tried to write to a friend to ask for help recently. Instead I was embarrassed that I can‚Äôt afford to pay them what they are worth and don‚Äôt want to ask for their charity.

I‚Äôm embarrassed. I‚Äôm terrified of the future and I‚Äôm trying so hard to find a way to navigate it that doesn‚Äôt result in my failure again. I‚Äôve failed my marriage, I failed my parents, long ago failed my sister, and I failed at being me for so long I ruined my life. And I don‚Äôt want to fail my kids any more than I already have.¬†

I need help taking 3 months off from work for bottom surgery recovery at the end of September. I need help getting my lawnmower working, I need help cleaning my house, renovating my bathroom, cleaning my room, repairing my patio. I need professional help leveraging the film about me premiering next month to set me up for the next success. I need so much help and I know how little I have to offer in return.¬†

1jjyh85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjyh85,Picked up a Popper (3rd iteration) from Sweet Maria's yesterday...,"I've wanted to roast at home for ages and it's a bit of a tragedy that while living 10 minutes away from Sweet Maria's, I've only now gotten my feet wet. Yesterday, I dropped by and picked up their [new Popper machine (3 iteration)](https://library.sweetmarias.com/popper-is-a-coffee-roaster-an-introduction/). It's their version of a popcorn air roaster but with adjustable fan speed , 7 heat levels, and a countdown timer. After lurking around here and debating on which roaster to get, I think I made the right choice for now. 100g at a time doesn't bother me since I only have 1-2 cups a day. I'd actually prefer smaller batches... so the Popper is perfect for me.

Anyway, I was surprised at how easy and rewarding this hobby is. I'm sure I'm over-simplifying it and will likely learn a lot over the years. However, I've roasted twice now. Yesterday, I burned the coffee I roasted (full city+), but after using it as a pour over this morning it was passable.

Today, I decided to roast some Kenya beans from SM. This time I did a bit more homework and found out the following:

1. For most roasts on the Popper, temp settings 2-4 are all that's necessary. Tom at SM suggested a general roasting strategy of:
   1. Start roasting at 4
   2. Reduce to 3 as beans start to yellow
   3. Drop to 2 after first crack
2. I tried out [roasting by weight loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm6G55_Jlhc) by putting the roaster on a scale and waiting for the target weight I was looking for... it worked surprisingly well and seems to be a good way to determine done-ness for a machine without thermometers.
3. I have the Popper connected to a Kill-a-Watt device so that I can see the wattage draw from the outlet. This is mildly useful to be able to track the relative heat levels between settings. The Popper's heat dial (potentiometer) feels like it may control the temperature continuously across the range, BUT it's not. The 7 steps is distinct. So, once you generally know what the relative temp/wattage draw is for each setting, trying to make fine micro adjustments to the heat dial isn't going to make a difference. On my machine, I observed the following wattage draws at each setting:
   1. \~790w
   2. \~875w
   3. \~930w
   4. \~1000w
   5. \~1070w
   6. \~1130w
   7. \~1180w

Understanding the relative difference between the power draw between steps is only mildly useful. My next step is to install two thermocouples into the roasting chamber to track the bean and air temperature during the roast... and maybe I'll hook it up to Artisan if I end up finding that useful.

All in all, I'm loving this new device and hobby. I can't wait to try the beans I roasted today. It may have to wait a few days before it's worth testing.

1jjy96j,https://www.reddit.com/r/LemonadeStandPodcast/comments/1jjy96j/my_opinion_on_the_education_discussion_as_a/,My opinion on the education discussion as a student/teacher,"Hi guys! Loving the pod. Thought I would give my thoughts in relation to the discussion you guys had about education in ep 3.

To give a bit of context - my name is Robbie and I am currently halfway through a business degree at an Australian university, I major in management and marketing. I also work part-time at the university in a teaching role tutoring classes of first year business subjects. I am 28 years old and came back to university after working in hospitality as bartender/manager since I was in my early 20s.


So first I would like to touch on the social aspect of the discussion. In my opinion, young people are definitely more tentative to socialise as time goes on. I do think covid has an impact on this, but I think it‚Äôs more of a result of the internet in general. I also would consider girls much better overall than young men. I think social skills and literacy overall is on a steady decline, and university and schools don‚Äôt seem to be able to do much about it. I think it‚Äôs not that students don‚Äôt actually WANT to socialise, it‚Äôs just they actually don‚Äôt know HOW. I think young people are becoming progressively more self conscious and are genuinely scared of how they will be perceived if they do attempt to socialise with strangers.

I think it is also worth noting that students themselves I really struggle with motivation as a whole. I think there is a belief that once you finish highschool you go to uni/college immediately, pick your career and off you go. I think that‚Äôs a fundamentally backwards approach. I think it is the extreme minority of young people who actually know what the fuck they want to do with their lives, and feel forced to attend higher education to maintain social norms and avoid prejudices. I think students should be encouraged to gain life experience and spend time thinking about what they want to do in life, and discover the skill sets that they have that they can capitalise on best. 

Now for education - I think it is quite a complex issue that‚Äôs very deeply rooted in the education systems themselves. Not only in university but also in middle/high school. I think there is still a stigma that surrounds the use of new technology (specially AI) that is instilled in the minds of young students that using AI etc is not ethical academic behaviour. I think this is a fundamentally backwards approach that really hinders students overall. It‚Äôs quite obvious that the education system should be teaching students that AI is only as smart as the person using it, and that these tools can be leveraged to improve the quality of your own work and their education as a whole. I believe most students come to university without the skills they need to study and engage in the content and assessment fully, so turn to AI to fill in these gaps. 

I think the main problem is that the technology itself is evolving at a rate that the educational institutions simply cannot keep up with. There is so much red tape that surrounds what can/can‚Äôt be taught, everything has to be checked and signed over and must be based on factual evidence based research etc. AI itself has emerged at such an exponential speed comparatively to other past tech that Unis/schools are simply not equipped to deal with it. It also is also worth saying that the people who are probably most qualified to teach these topics are not actually people in education. I think for the educational system to improve it will take drastic foundational changes, in attitude, topics and basic structure.

 If you read this far, thanks! As I said, loving the pod.

Paid for the car in full with a  cashiers check , I have paperwork and a receipt.  6 days later the car salesman called and said that someone spilled coffee on the cashiers check and they needed me to get them a new one.  I called my bank, they said their policy requires a 90 day waiting period to ensure that the check has not been cashed, then they can cancel the check and then we can get a new check.  The only other option was to have them dry the check out, get it to me, I can bring it into the bank. depending on the severity of the damage, they may be able to cancel the check and issue a new one which would be a lot faster.  When I informed the dealership what my bank told me, they said the check was thrown away and that 90 days was too long. They wanted me to write them a check and they would hold on to it until I got them a new cashiers check in 90 days. I told him I was not going to write them a check.  I also asked if this coffee spilling incident just happened that day since they were just calling me, and could they get the check out of the trash and let it dry so we could get it to the bank and get a new one.  He would not give me a straight answer, changed the subject, and then said he would call me back.  He later called and said to just start whatever needed to happen to have the check cancelled and then reissued after 90 days.  A few days later my ex-husband called the salesman to see if they had sent title paperwork to Ohio BMV yet so that we would know when to expect it, we need that to register the vehicle in Indiana, and the temporary tags are only good for 45 days  The salesman told him that they were not going to release the title to us until we got them a check.  He gave my ex the same option, to write him a check and they would hold on to it and not cash it, and return it to him when they got their cashiers check in 90 days.  My ex said yeah ok but I'm post dating the check, to which the salesman replied that he can't do that because its illegal.  I told him not to send them anything because I really don't see how what they are trying to do is not illegal.  I paid them, in full, I have a receipt saying it was paid for in cash.  I don't see this situation as any different than if they were on their way to their bank to deposit this check and they got robbed,  and then tried to tell me I had to get them another check.  No.  They are trying to make this my problem, to fix their mistake.  Can they really withhold the title??  Anyone with any suggestions or advice please would be appreciated.  *I understand, they don't know me.  I am an honest person.  I fully intend to follow through and get a new cashiers check to them as soon as my bank will allow*. But again, this is not my mistake at all.

1jjxzm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jjxzm3/sf_the_last_stop_motel/,[SF] The Last Stop Motel,"It was a average Tuesday morning, except this morning I woke up and for almost 30 years I did not have to rush to jump in the shower, get dressed and fight my way through traffic to my office. 


As I lay in my bed thinking about what I am going to do with my life now, thoughts of ending everything weighed heavy on my mind however I brushed them aside as soon as they flooded in. 


The bedroom tv is on and some morning news anchors are mumbling but I only hear what is going on in my head. I glanced down at my bedside table filled with empty bottles and look into my drawer where I kept a pistol then something made me look back up to the TV and I don't know what the story on the morning news was about but they were showing shots of Route 66. 


I am looking at the tv with a sudden feeling like I wanted to be instantly transported to somewhere out on the open road, nothing but miles in front of me and miles behind me. 


I guess that was enough to get me up out of my bed with a purpose, I went to my garage and grabbed a suitcase. I just dumped some clothes in there, some toiletries and my pistol. 


My last thought was to make one cup of coffee and leave a note. I just wrote ""To Whom it may Concern"" I didn't finish the note but just left it on my kitchen counter and walked out of my house and slipped the house key in the mail slot behind me. 


I had no idea where I was going, I had about $326 in cash. Next stop I will withdraw more to keep me going. I just get in my car and set out on my final adventure for this life. 


I knew the direction I wanted to head maybe towards the nearest point of Route 66, the old mother road. I can't remember the lyrics of the song but I do remember ""Don't Forget Winona, so I put Winona in my GPS. Turns out it's in Arizona, Ok then that is my start of where I am going. 


At one of my fueling stops I was able to pull up the song on my phone and have it playing along with someone's road trip play list that I kept going and driving to. 


I started to get tired but I didn't stop for the night just pulled over to a rest stop to take a short nap, I felt like the road was calling me, pulling me like if I was late to an appointment that I didn't have. 


I pull over at the far end of a rest stop, get out to stretch my legs and use the restroom. I make it back to my car and there are no other cars near me so I pull my seat back and take a nap. I was awoken to the sound of some kids messing with a car horn and I must have been out for hours because it was that time of night where you can just start to see a bit of orange bleeding into the night sky, sure enough it was after 4am. 


I get out and use the restroom one more time and wash some cold water on my face and jump back into my car, now the only thing on my mind was a nice hot cup of coffee. 


I pull into an old mom and pop diner that looked like they tried their best to update it maybe in the 1980's to look like a 1950's style diner, you know a lot of Mickey Mouse, Elvis and Coke crap that you would see in a flea market. 


I ordered a small breakfast, cup of coffee and another cup to go. 


Now I am on Interstate 40 and almost to my destination of Winona, everything looks so empty, nothing really that great around me, I pull over and wonder why it was included in the song, I shake my head like this isn't it. 


I start driving to my next destination, Flagstaff, and by the time I reach Flagstaff I am also not so impressed with the surroundings, sad looking area maybe I was just in a bad mood, thinking that Route 66 is letting me down. I grab a burrito, fill up my car again and head on out to my next stop Gallup New Mexico. 

However, something started to happen. I felt like I needed a real bed and take a break from the road, I am telling myself I am in really no hurry, I don't have to be somewhere or anywhere at any certain time. Just off I-40 some small town, I don't know the name, I didn't pay attention it was almost like something was driving me to this motel. 


The motel looked like it had been there since the old days of Route 66, Neon lights that some were burnt out, one of those places where you just pull almost up to the door of your motel room. 


I stop just in front of managers office and asked him if they had a Vacancy, he looked at me like are you nuts boy, there were only 3 cars in the parking lot, silly question maybe the hours of being on the road just didn't have me thinking right. 


The manager tells me, it's normally $72 for the night but I will go ahead and give you our special rate $66 dolllars for the night, I smiled and said oh like Route 66. He looked at me again and said, now we don't allow loud music, no parties, no weapons, and if you're hungry you can walk down about 1/2 a block and the BBQ place there closes at 9.


I said I only plan to sleep and shower but thank you anyway, he starts to go on and on about all the famous people who once stayed here way back in the day, he named actors who I either didn't know or just was too tired to try to place. He also made a joke about the local Indians and don't start no trouble with them. He hadn't given me my key yet, until he got his fill of converstaion, but I already filled out the registration card, make, model, color and contact number. He said something about Oh boy back in the day, we had everyone from jazz singers, to love birds on their honey moon staying here, if these walls could talk. 


I finally got the key from him and it was an actual Key, I haven't been to a hotel that had an actual key since I was a kid. Room 166, Just down the driveway at the end and turn right. 


I pull up right in front of my room, no one else near me, I open the motel door and musty old smell, you know that smell like when you were a kid and visiting your grandparents and you went in that one room that no one ever went in and where they stored a bunch of junk. 


I walk in set my suitcase on the table, use the restroom, I look around and think to myself, man people used to Honey moon here, how many of them ended in divorce after check in. 


I guess back in the 1950's this was swanky but not today, everything looked original even the lumpy mattress. I lay down, kick off my shoes and close my eyes. I must have instantly fallen asleep as I don't remember anything else up to this point. 


I hear oldies music playing in a faint distance, I remember what the old man said at the Motel Office no loud music but it continued, then I heard a woman's voice laughing and saying something that I can't make out. 

My eyes are still closed at this point, my brain and my ears are working and I am not annoyed but it but just hear very faint distant voices and what seemed like cheerful talking and music. I started to recognize the song, ""I count the moments darling till your here with me, together at last at twilight time..."" 


I turn and open my eyes and I am dumbfounded as it is daylight outside, how could this be? I know I didn't fall asleep all night and wake up the following morning. 


I stumble out of bed and look out of the window and to my shock there are about 20 other cars all in the Motel Parking lot, people are outside, and the Motel looks great, clean and not like the dump I checked into, there is actual grass. What caught my attention next was all of the cars were late model 1950's cars, I thought to myself ""oh it must be one of those old car meet ups"" They do that at a coffee shop in my city every 2nd Saturday of the month. 


Everyone there looked really great too, everyone was dressed up in 1950's clothes and even smoking openly, something that you really don't see today. 


They are dressed really nice and not like the sterotypical 50's poodle skirts and guys with the leather jackets and jeans, but dressed up in dress pants, ties, sweaters and the girls all had dresses on and looked really nice. 


I looked over to where my car is parked and notice that my car is not there anymore, Holy shit did someone steal my car? 


I opened the door to my room and still seeing everyone outside, some people were packing, and there was a couple over by the grass area on a picnic bench eating homemade sandwiches and the lady waived at me but then looked at me very confused. I must have looked odd because of how I was dressed. I closed the door and look over to the bedside table for the phone to call the front desk and there was no phone. In fact some of the furniture was not the same as when I fell asleep. 

There should have been a large cabinet that had a tv inside of it but in it's place was a table and two chairs. 


I am looking around and everything else seems like how it was, just no TV cabinet with the Microwave and mini Fridge and no phone in the room. 


I once again walk over to the door and look outside and no my car still isn't there and its not anywhere in sight. 


The thing is up to that point I had not walked outside the motel room just looked out the window and looked out the open motel door. 


I opened the door again and the moment I placed my foot outside the motel door, everything changed. It was suddenly night, my car was there, the place was a dump again, all of the 1950's cars in the parking lot disappeared. 


Am I going crazy, I turn to look back in my room and there is the crappy 27 inch tv, phone on the bedside table. Ok so I step back into my room, and sit on the edge of my bed thinking I am finally losing it. 

I get up one more time and look out the window, it's dark and yes outside it's still a rock of crack short of a crack house motel. 


I am shaking my head, all the stress of my life, being tired from driving, everything that has gone wrong up to this point, yeah I am cracking up. 


I lay down again, turn on the tv flip to the most boring thing I can find, a documentary about some old findings on some island I don't care just want some noise and I soon drift off to sleep again. 


I wake up to use the restroom, and oh shit, the tv cabinet is gone, no phone, I turn to look towards the window and again light is shining through. Am I dreaming, am I going crazy? I open the door and my car is gone again, although this time I do not step outside. 

I am just looking outside, I have a feeling like I don't belong in this world, maybe that is why I transport back once I step outside. 


Just as a million thoughts are racing through my mind I hear a ladies voice say, Hey mister are you OK? 

I turn and see the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life, she looked like a living doll, I am almost ashamed of how I look to even be talking to her. I said I am fine, I might be crazy but fine. We started talking and she tells me that she is on a trip with her sister and brother in law and they are on their way to a wedding in New Mexico. 


Even though I must have looked like a bum, my hair all crazy and my clothes not from the time period, she is very kind and we have a full conversation, I never had an instant connection with someone like that before, she tells me that she teaches at a school in California, and how most of her family lives in California and the other half lives in New Mexico. She looks at me and tells me wait here, like if I could actually leave my room but she doesn't know that.


She walks back and hands me half a sandwich, she said that I look like I could use something in my belly. I quickly grab a chair from my motel room and hand it to her and I sit in the other chair. 

We go on to have the type of conversation that you instantly feel like you met the person you were supposed to meet and in the back of your brain you hate the seconds that pass as you know you will be seperated soon. 

Just as we are talking about well, movies I have yet to see and current events that I don't remember, we just talk about life, and the kinds of things that gets your mind thinking that you just want to grab her and kiss her already. 


Our hand inadvertanly touch and she smiles at me, she tells me that she isn't the kind of lady who talks to strange men at motels. We laugh and I tell her I am not the type of gentleman who takes sandwiches from strange ladies I meet at motels. 


She smiles and looks down at my hand, she said that she has never seen a watch like the one I am wearing, I said it's a smart watch, she said well it can't be that smart the watch is just black with no dials. She grabs my hand and pulls me up and said let's go get a soda. She starts to pull me out of the motel door and as I walk out, boom it's pitch black she is gone. 


I am standing outside my motel room alone and heartbroken all over again.",1,1742946024.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

 A month ago, I made the switch to a dairy-free lifestyle, as I feel it has several negative effects on my health, particularly with inflammation and joint pain. I'm currently searching for a suitable creamer for my coffee, but my go-to oat milk really disrupts my digestion.

I think oat milk tastes fantastic, but it causes awful rumbling, discomfort, and gas in my large intestine for hours after consumption. It's such a bummer since I love the flavor. I've tried Nut Pods, but coconut milk upsets my stomach and bowels, too. I'm not a fan of the taste of almond milk. I'm hoping to find out if anyone has come across a ""milk"" that is gentle on the digestive system and still tastes good.  Maybe help me save some money before I go on a big buying spree only to dump something down the drain ;) 

Thanks!

**OMEGA**

**Prologue**

**October 23, 1967**

¬†‚ÄúWith the help of ArmaTech, new technology is a regular occurrence here! Their newest invention, the ArmaTech Remotely Operated Spacecrafts, or ROVs, are capable of exploring the full extent of our universe! These are extremely helpful towards our goal of fully exploring the multiverse! Remember, we are reaching the beyond together! Thank you, ArmaTech!‚Äù The AI announces, its voice echoing through the laboratory hallways.¬†

¬†Gene scoffs and turns away from his computer. Neil looks to his side to see Gene staring at him. He takes off his headphones.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat do you need, Gene?‚Äù he asks, still tired from the 2 hours of sleep he got the night before.¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou hear the AI just now?‚Äù Gene asks.

¬†‚ÄúNo, I was operating the ROV‚Ä¶ like we‚Äôre supposed to.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWell, it just called these pieces of junk ‚Äòwonderful‚Äô. We‚Äôve been using ‚Äòem for almost a week and we haven't found jack!‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre traveling through an entire universe, Gene. There‚Äôs bound to be something. A rift could open up anywhere.‚Äù Neil says, taking a sip of his coffee, and then placing it right next to the other 3 cups.

¬†‚ÄúYou know my wife is beginning to get suspicious. I‚Äôm telling her I'm working at this spa, but sometimes I slip up and talk about how this drone can‚Äôt steer for shit! Or the fact I can‚Äôt explain the reason why I‚Äôm getting paid a ridiculous amount for working at a spa.‚Äù

¬†Neil makes a clicking sound with his mouth, ‚ÄúWhat are you getting at?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat I'm getting at, is that there‚Äôs no point in not telling the general public about all of this stuff! We haven‚Äôt even found anything. What harm does knowing abou‚Äì‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúJesus not this again, you crazy?! Mauser hears you talking like this, you're dead!‚Äù Neil warns in a hushed, panicked voice.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know man. There‚Äôs a lotta smart people out there without the resources to land a job like this. If they knew about this stuff, we‚Äôd get everything done a whole lot faster!‚Äù Gene explains, whispering.

¬†‚ÄúGovernments like their secrets. We‚Äôre the only country that knows about this stuff. If we released this stuff to the press, who knows what could happen? Eventually, Russia could go to another universe and grab... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ a galactic missile that's able to destroy the entire world except them.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúSo we think of this as another space race instead of, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ being able to find the cure to cancer?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs a messed up place. I hate keeping secrets from the old ball and chain as much as you‚Ä¶ but I also like not being vaporized by an other-worldly laser China got from another universe.‚Äù

¬†Gene sighs, his lips compressing into a thin line.¬†

¬†The two both turn back to their computers and continue their work, but both are unable to shake that thought from their head. Neil tries to keep up with operating the ROV‚Ä¶ but he can‚Äôt help but think, why *can't* the public know about it? Yes, the risk is high, but so is the reward. Seemingly infinite universes open up seemingly infinite possibilities! Possibilities for solutions to problems like world hunger‚Ä¶ but also possibilities for problems much worse than ones they could ever have if the multiverse was kept a secret.¬†

¬†Conflicted, Neil asks Gene to take control of the ROV and steps up to the roof of Lenny‚Äôs Spa, a front to their research facility. He lights a cigarette to get his mind off of things, but it only makes it worse. No work to distract him, only the cold air, the view of Summit City, both the rich, corporate side and the poor side, and his thoughts. He wonders, how many Summit Cities are there? Infinite universes mean infinite Summit Cities, but what if there aren‚Äôt infinite universes? A limited multiverse?

¬†In the middle of Neil conjuring his thoughts, someone clears their throat to get his attention. Neil turns his head to see the principal investigator, Joe Mauser.

¬†‚ÄúWhat were you and Gene talking about, Neil?‚Äù Mauser says, sucking his teeth impatiently.

¬†Neil tenses his brows. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ the ROVs. Haven‚Äôt found anything during a whole week of searching with these new things.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúMhm, mhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Mauser tenses his jaw. ‚ÄúKeep your dog under control.‚Äù

¬†Mauser makes eye contact with Neil, stepping closer up to him, close enough to feel Neil‚Äôs terrified breaths. Neil gulps and nods obediently.¬†

¬†Mauser takes the cigarette from Neil‚Äôs hand, putting it into his mouth, and walks away.

¬†‚ÄúThat was my last cig‚Ä¶‚Äù Neil mutters weakly.

¬†Mauser pauses mid-step and looks back. After a few moments, he continues walking away. No words were said, but the message is clear, Neil doesn‚Äôt get the luxury of complaining.

¬†Neil heads back downstairs, following a few minutes after Mauser. He sits down at his desk and turns to Gene.¬†

¬†‚ÄúTell me you aren‚Äôt gonna tell your wife,‚Äù he says.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Gene says softly, twiddling with his fingers nervously, ‚ÄúI won't. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre in a rough patch. Telling her all of this would answer a lot of questions she has.‚Äù

¬†Neil looks to his side and sees Mauser glaring at him from his office. ‚ÄúHey, I get it. I had a hard time lying to my wife at the beginning too. How about we grab some drinks in a few minutes, the day is almost over. We can come up with some lies that‚Äì‚Äù He says, being interrupted by Gene.

¬†‚ÄúLying? To them? Neil, these are my wife and kids! You have a daughter coming soon, imagine lying to her. Your daughter! You are one of the two people she should be able to trust without a second thought‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre lying about your whole life to her! She practically doesn‚Äôt even know you!‚Äù

¬†Neil clicks his mouth and glances at the ceiling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for the greater good,‚Äù he says, a desperate attempt to convince Gene to not tell his wife, and a pathetic one to try to convince himself that what he‚Äôs doing is right.¬†

¬†Gene stares at him and scoffs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even gonna entertain the bullshit that just came out of your mouth. I won‚Äôt tell her.‚Äù¬†

¬†As Gene walks off, Neil exhales and lowers his head, disappointed.

¬†‚ÄúWoodall! Gene! Get over here! You need to see this!‚Äù one of Neil‚Äôs colleagues, Raymond Poltz, says.¬†

¬†Neil walks over and makes his way through the crowd of all the other scientists in their lab, following behind Woodall. As Neil makes his way through, he sees that they‚Äôre all huddled around the HAZMAT room.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù Woodall asks.

¬†‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Gene?‚Äù Poltz replies.

¬†‚ÄúHe left,‚Äù Neil says, butting in.

¬†‚ÄúShit, he‚Äôs good at making sense of things‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Did you find something?‚Äù Neil asks.

¬†‚ÄúOh I found something alright,‚Äù Poltz says, getting out of the way for Neil and Woodall to see a robotic arm reaching into the delivery hole in the HAZMAT room, coming back with a tablet, and laying it on the examination table. Neil looks through the glass, examining it.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Woodall asks.

‚ÄúHere, put this on,‚Äù Poltz advises, throwing him a HAZMAT suit. ‚ÄúI found it a few weeks ago. I only thought it was a fragment of an asteroid‚Ä¶ but my camera kept getting fuzzy whenever I looked at it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRadioactive?‚Äù Woodall asks, putting on the HAZMAT suit.

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù

The two enter the room, and as Poltz closes the door behind them, Woodall examines the tablet. He runs his fingers along the edges.

¬†It reads, ""Lo, the Prophesied shall rise, a vessel of unyielding might, a bridge 'twixt realms where none dare tread. By their hand alone shall the veils 'twixt universes be rended, and thus shall they lead an army, fierce and unrelenting, to destinies foreordained. Loved by but a precious few, despised by the many, and when the hour of their end draweth near, their loss shall be bewailed by but a solitary heart. Know this: their path, carved by the fates from the moment of creation, is immutable, as the stars that doth wheel above. Neither mortal will nor immortal meddling may sway the course writ in the fabric of existence. To them cometh both glory and woe, in measures most harrowing and profound. Thus it is written, thus it shall be: the Prophesied shall bear the weight of worlds, their destiny a chain unbroken 'til the final breath escape their lips, and the cosmos shall hearken to their passing, thus gradually eroding.""

¬†Woodall stares at it, confused.

¬†Neil pushes his way to the front, trying to see what they‚Äôre doing.

¬†‚ÄúWhen‚Äôd you say you found this?‚Äù Woodall asks, laying his hand on the tablet.¬†

¬†‚ÄúMaybe 3 weeks ago?‚Äù

¬†Woodall‚Äôs heart sinks. Words cannot escape his mouth. His eyes roll back, showing just white. He struggles to breathe, his inhales only being short whistles. Suddenly, his eyes roll back, and he leans over with a desperate breath. His eyes return on the tablet, focused, and terrified.

‚Äú3 weeks ago‚Ä¶ this was‚Äì‚Äù He says, out of breath, being interrupted by Poltz

‚ÄúIn our galaxy, yes,‚Äù Poltz replies, confused as to what just happened.

‚ÄúWhat are they saying in there?‚Äù Neil asks the man beside him.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI dunno, Woodall sure looks scared though,‚Äù the man answers.¬†

¬†‚ÄúOh my god‚Ä¶‚Äù Woodall says weakly.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Poltz asks.¬†

‚ÄúThis is older than our galaxy‚Ä¶ our *universe*.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

¬†Woodall sighs, his breaths staggering.

¬†‚ÄúIt told me‚Ä¶ when I touched it‚Ä¶‚Äù He explains, his words barely escaping his throat.

¬†Poltz scoffs, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll the tablet tell me then?‚Äù He says, playfully, walking over to the tablet.¬†

¬†‚ÄúNO! Get out of there!‚Äù Woodall yells, shoving Poltz away.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Poltz whimpers.

¬†He realizes the thirty-two-year-old Woodall suddenly looks like he‚Äôs fifty, and leaves the room. Woodall lays his hand on the tablet again.

¬†Neil knocks on the glass, trying to get Woodall‚Äôs attention.

¬†‚ÄúThe hell is he doing in there?‚Äù Neil asks, turning his head towards Poltz.

¬†His head swiftly turns back when Woodall cries, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to die! All of you! You‚Äôre all going to die! Get out of here!‚Äù His words are filled with pure terror and desperation.¬†

¬†‚ÄúPlease spare them! Please!‚Äù Woodall begs the tablet.¬†

¬†Neil bangs his fist on the glass. ‚ÄúWoodall! I‚Äôm not going anywhere! Do you need me to come in there and help you?!‚Äù He asks, concerned for his colleague.¬†

¬†‚ÄúNo!! Don‚Äôt come in here!‚Äù Woodall shrieks, turning around towards the glass.¬†

¬†¬†Neil's face contorts in disgust, fear, and concern. He stares into Woodall's sunken eyes. His skin is too loose for his face. His teeth are rotten and his lips are dry. His hair is grey and thin.

¬†Rapidly, his gums begin to tighten, causing some teeth to fall out. Neil watches as Woodall loses control of his bladder. His voice begins to get raspier and harder to understand. Suddenly, he falls to the ground, dead.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened?!‚Äù Neil yells in fear.¬†

¬†Poltz stares through the glass at Woodall‚Äôs already-decayed corpse. Neil rushes over and grabs him by the shirt.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat the hell happened to Woodall?!‚Äù Neil screams in his face.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Poltz tries to make out a logical reason, but can‚Äôt wrap his head around the fact that‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt one.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Neil yells, demanding an answer.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHe said‚Ä¶ he said the tablet told him‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†Neil turns his head in confusion, ‚ÄúThe hell does that mean?‚Äù he utters, his grip on Poltz‚Äôs chest slightly loosening, ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?!‚Äù now yelling, both in fear and anger.

¬†‚ÄúHe said the tablet told him it was older than our‚Ä¶ our universe‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†Neil lets go of Poltz and goes back to the window, staring at Woodall's already skeletonized corpse, ‚ÄúSo the tablet told him it was ancient, and then told him we‚Äôre *all* going to die, and then killed him?!‚Äù he says, choking on his words.¬†

¬†‚ÄúNot ancient‚Ä¶ as old as time‚Ä¶ as old as god, or‚Ä¶ gods‚Äù

¬†‚Äú*Gods*? Plural?‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúIt should be obvious‚Ä¶ only gods could create something as beautiful and vast as the multiverse‚Ä¶‚Äù Poltz mutters under his breath, staring at Woodall‚Äôs corpse. A fiery look in his eye. Jealousy. He is the one who found the tablet. He is the one who deserves to know the knowledge of the multiverse! Not Woodall! The man who runs to get coffee for him and the rest of the research team? The man who runs to the copier at Raymond Poltz‚Äôs demand? Unless‚Ä¶ unless Poltz is meant for something greater‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ that must be it.¬†

¬†Neil stares at Poltz like he‚Äôs a freak. Always rambling on about the multiverse like he‚Äôs insane. Although, he knows he‚Äôs not. An insane man couldn‚Äôt be nearly as smart as Poltz, as abnormal as he is. Before Neil can say anything, Mauser steps in, and behind him is a team of armed soldiers with ‚ÄúOMEGA‚Äù patches velcroed to their chests and shoulders.¬†

¬†‚ÄúThe hell‚Äôs OMEGA?‚Äù Neil asks the scientist next to him, Clark.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen these guys in my life. Are we upping security?‚Äù Clark responds, just as confused.¬†

¬†‚ÄúEveryone clear out! Poltz, stay with me and tell me what happened while my guys take him,‚Äù Mauser shouts.

¬†As Neil and the rest of the research team head back to their desks for their things, Neil listens in on the conversation between Mauser and Poltz.

¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Woodall,‚Äù Poltz explains, whispering.

¬†‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Ä¶ *that‚Äôs* Woodall?! He‚Äôs a skeleton!‚Äù Mauser exclaims in a hushed voice.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHe touched the tablet in there‚Ä¶ he said it told him we were all going to die‚Ä¶ that it‚Äôs older than our universe.‚Äù

¬†Mauser clenches his jaw. Not a shocked reaction to his employee‚Äôs death nor a hint of sadness. Just a minor inconvenience.¬†

¬†Neil goes back to his desk and puts on his jacket, as he grabs his wallet, he glances at the framed paternity photos of his wife. All he can do is hope Gene didn‚Äôt tell his. He follows the rest of the research team to the elevator leading back up to the spa.¬†

¬†As he and the research team leave the spa, he‚Äôs approached by one of the workers there.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre friends with that one middle-aged guy right? Slicked back hair, mustache?‚Äù The worker asks.

¬†‚ÄúYeah, Gene. What about him?‚Äù Neil responds, worried.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHe was walking outta here pretty early, rambling about telling his wife or something‚Ä¶‚Äù The worker explains, leaning in further, ‚ÄúI don't know the specifics on what kinda drugs you guys are sellin‚Äô under here, but I assume telling his wife ain‚Äôt too good. Thought I'd let you know.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù Neil mutters under his breath, ‚ÄúThanks for the info boss‚Äù He says, rushing out to his car in the rain.¬†

¬†He slams the door shut and turns the ignition. As the car roars to life, he immediately puts it into reverse and backs out of the parking lot.¬†

¬†The worker walks behind the front counter and picks up the phone, dialing a number. When someone picks up, he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs James, Neil‚Äôs on his way right now,‚Äù and hangs up. He walks back up to the lobby and watches as Neil drives towards Gene‚Äôs house, going 20 above the speed limit, his tires screeching at every stop and turn.¬†

¬†‚ÄúGo you stupid bastards!‚Äù Neil yells at the cars in front of him, slamming his palm on the steering wheel, terrified of the possibility that Gene already told his wife.¬†

¬†As Neil passes a 3-way intersection, a car t-bones him. He tries to take control of his car, but it hydroplanes, steering out of control. After what feels like minutes, the front of his car slams into a light post at 62 miles per hour, slamming Neil‚Äôs head into the steering wheel after the airbag fails to deploy.¬†

¬†After a few seconds, Neil wakes up and leans back onto the car seat. He looks around, seeing two of everything, and his vision fuzzy. ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶‚Äù He mumbles, confused. He looks up, only to be met with the blinding light from the light post he hit. He winces in pain and covers his eyes. As he lowers his hand, he sees it covered in blood, glass, and skin. Suddenly, he gets a splitting headache. He unbuckles his seatbelt and tries to get out, but is stopped by a hand reaching in through his broken window and pushing him against his seat.¬†

¬†‚ÄúAre you okay sir?‚Äù A familiar voice asks.

¬†Before Neil can answer, he hears loud crackling, and then a sharp pain in his neck, making all of the muscles in his body contract. Neil screams out in pain, but passes out again after a few short moments. His body is dragged out of the car, and placed into the backseat of the vehicle that hit him.¬†

¬†Hours later, Neil wakes up, tied to a chair with a bag over his face. He pleads for help for minutes on end, but nothing responds. Suddenly, the bag is pulled off of his head. Neil winces as the sudden light hits his eyes. He looks to the side to see Mauser.

¬†Before either of the two can say anything, an OMEGA soldier drags the unconscious body of Gene into the storage unit.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù Neil barely mutters out, redirecting his gaze towards Mauser again.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll let Gene tell you,‚Äù Mauser responds, kicking Gene awake.

¬†With a loud and sharp gasp, Gene awakens. Hyperventilating, he looks around the room and sees Neil.¬†

¬†‚ÄúNeil! Neil, get out of here! They killed‚Äì‚Äù¬†

¬†Mauser puts his boot over Gene's throat, blocking his airway. He unholsters his gun and points it to Gene‚Äôs head.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhy are you two in here?‚Äù Mauser says, commanding Gene to answer. As Mauser takes his boot off, Gene takes a quick breath.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶¬† told her‚Ä¶‚Äù He mumbles, defeated.¬†

¬†Neil furrows his brows and gives Gene a pained look.¬†

¬†‚ÄúI had to!‚Äù Gene yells, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt lie to her any longer! They‚Ä¶ they killed her‚Ä¶ they killed‚Ä¶ oh my god they killed my baby girl! My baby!‚Äù He cries, lying his bruised, bloody, and beaten face on the concrete floor.¬†

¬†Neil's eyes widen in fear, and he looks at Mauser, who is checking the cylinder of his Ruger Hawkeye. He makes eye contact with Neil and throws his cylinder back into place. He walks up behind him and kneels to eye level.

Mauser puts the gun's hammer to Neils ear, and slams it down, making him flinch.¬†

¬†Tripping on his words and in between staggered breaths, Neil mutters out, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt us!‚Äù¬†

¬†Mauser scoffs. He watches Gene sob into the concrete, his expression unreadable. He spins the Ruger Hawkeye in his hand, inspecting it with almost casual interest.¬†

""You know,"" he says, tapping the side of the revolver, ""they only made about three thousand of these. A rare piece. Precision, craftsmanship‚Ä¶ exclusivity.""¬†

He leans in closer to Neil, pressing the cold barrel against his bruised temple. ""Three thousand. And yet, somehow, even that tiny number is bigger than the amount of people who will ever know your name."" He leans in closer, voice dropping to a whisper. ""Three thousand. You? Just one. And after tonight, not even that.""

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna fucking die! You killed my baby girl!‚Äù Gene seethes.

¬†Mauser stands up, puts the barrel of the gun along Neil‚Äôs ear, and shoots. Splattering Gene‚Äôs brain and skull across the metal walls of the unit they‚Äôre kept in, while also bursting Neil‚Äôs eardrum. Gene‚Äôs blood pools around his body, and small fragments of his skull follow.¬†

¬†Neil screams in both pain and grief. Blood rushes out of his ear canal, and loud ringing blocks out any sound. He stares at his best friend's lifeless, motionless body as he cries out.¬†

‚ÄúWhat a waste of intelligence,‚Äù Mauser puts the hot barrel of his Ruger onto Neil‚Äôs backhand, burning it. Neil bares his teeth and cries out. Suddenly, the ringing stops as Mauser takes the barrel off of his hand.

¬†‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to Neil‚Ä¶ but this is the consequence of‚Äì‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking murderer!‚Äù Neil screams, interrupting Mauser.

¬†In a rage, Mauser pistol whips Neil, knocking a tooth out. ‚ÄúLet me finish!‚Äù He screams back. ‚ÄúThis is the consequence of endangering the sanctity of our organization, our country, our UNIVERSE!‚Äù¬†

¬†Neil breaks down into tears, becoming a hiccup-ridden, snotty mess. ‚ÄúWhat did I do?! I didn‚Äôt tell anyone!‚Äù He shrieks.¬†

¬†Mauser takes a deep breath, calming himself down. ‚ÄúYou would‚Äôve found out about Gene at some point, you‚Äôre too smart to fool,‚Äù Mauser admits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happened before‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Neil blubbers.¬†

¬†Mauser reaches into his pocket and pulls out a long, silver tool, similar to a pen. ‚ÄúWe wiped your memories. Jack Tesingal. You and Gene were buddy-buddy with him until he tried to go on record about the existence of the multiverse. After a year, you figured it out. The only two who did! You two are the smartest people we have, and possibly will ever have. We couldn‚Äôt waste your intelligence, so we did it again. And here we are‚Ä¶‚Äù He explains.

¬†Neil‚Äôs crying is replaced with confusion. ‚ÄúMemory wiping?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe, along with ArmaTech, kept it from you. Didn‚Äôt see much use of it if you knew of its existence. Now it‚Äôll be used to cover up your deaths, and *your* existence.‚Äù¬†

¬†As Mauser puts the memory-wiping device back and readies his gun, Neil pleads with him to stop. ‚ÄúWait! My‚Ä¶ My wife! She‚Äôs pregnant! Who will she think is the father?! She‚Äôll figure something out!‚Äù He begs.¬†

¬†‚ÄúYour wife was an undercover operative for us, Neil. And your child‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúThe child is mine. Having a child in secrecy is the safest way to pass on the title of director for an organization like this one. It wasn‚Äôt personal‚Ä¶ although she was the one who initiated,‚Äù Mauser says, trying to rile Neil up.¬†

¬†Instead of getting angry upon hearing the news, Neil jolts back in his seat, heartbroken. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ mine?‚Äù He whispers. All those nights spent not being able to sleep out of excitement, the gifts he picked out for each birthday until eighteen, all spent on a child not his, with a wife who didn‚Äôt see anything of him other than a job. A bullet rips through his heart and his flesh, he lays limp in the chair he‚Äôs tied to.

¬†Mauser holsters his gun and closes the storage unit door. As he's walking away, the OMEGA soldier confronts him.

¬†‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt have just killed them?‚Äù The soldier asks.¬†

¬†Mauser turns to face him, ‚ÄúThey were gonna die anyways, why not have fun with it?‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane!‚Äù

¬†Mauser stops in his tracks and tenses his jaw. ‚ÄúDo you think the higher-ups would‚Äôve picked a *sane* man for this job?‚Äù he asks.

¬†The soldiers stay silent, and eventually, the two resume walking back to the car.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWe need to go to Omen Tower. The command center is being built there, we should set up,‚Äù Mauser demands as he gets in the passenger seat.¬†

**November 21, 2017**

¬†Sam wakes up in his bed to his alarm. He reluctantly grabs his phone to turn it off. As he sits up, he stares out of his bedroom window, looking at the slums of Summit City from the third floor of his apartment. He slowly rises from his bed and searches his closet for an outfit to wear. After a few minutes of finding clean underwear and socks, he picks out a pair of black straight-leg jeans, a red compression shirt, and a black hoodie, carrying the clothes to the bathroom and setting them on the toilet seat.¬†

¬†He turns the shower handle to the left and gets in. As the water shoots out of the shower head, a loud whistle begins to be sung by the pipes. The water doesn‚Äôt warm up, instead, it stays at an icy cold temperature. As he gets in, he flexes all of the muscles in his body and lets out a gasp, not yet used to the freezing water as it pelts his skin. He lets in slow, tight breaths, trying to fight off the urge to get out. He turns to wash his hair and shivers in the cold. After scrubbing his body and rinsing the shampoo out of his hair, he hurriedly leaves the shower and turns the handle to the right, shutting off the water and ending the annoying whistle. He grabs the towel off of the rack and dries off. While he dries his hair, he looks in the mirror, staring into his own hazel eyes. He drops the towel, and his almost golden hair drops down, covering his eyes and almost his nose. Combing and styling his hair into a natural part, it now falls just below his ears, revealing his eyes again. He throws the comb back onto the sink, leaving himself with a slightly unkempt look. With his features, you‚Äôd think he was rich, and he was, for a while.¬†

¬†Now, he‚Äôs rich in a different way. His phone rings, Grace, his girlfriend. He picks up his phone to answer, but before he does, he admires the cover photo of her for a while. Her slightly wavy brown hair, perfect white teeth, and green eyes you could get lost in. Grace was born rich like Sam, but she stayed that way. You‚Äôd have to be rich to afford her getting a blowout every five weeks.

¬†Sam answers the phone with a smile on his face, putting her on speaker and quickly wrapping a towel around his waist.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù He asks, his voice deep, but slightly a higher pitch than when he talks to anyone else.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHey, Sam! I was just calling to ask if you wanted coffee. My sister wants some so I could get you some if you‚Äôd like?‚Äù Grace asks, her voice the opposite of Sam‚Äôs. High-pitched and softly spoken.

¬†Sam ponders for a moment while getting dressed before coming to a decision, ‚ÄúDo they have hot cocoa?‚Äù He asks.

¬†Grace giggles, knowing he‚Äôd say that, ‚ÄúYes, Sam, they do. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs extra hot, I can practically hear you shivering. Love you!‚Äù

¬†Sam smiles, ‚ÄúI love you too,‚Äù he says before Grace hangs up.

¬†He‚Äôs met with a deafening silence, and his smile slowly drops into a blank expression. He throws his sweatshirt over his head, and as he‚Äôs fitting his arms through the sleeves, he hears his stepfather walking out of his room. He tries to open the bathroom door, but Sam quickly locks it. His heart rate slightly spikes, Sam heard the beating Paul gave his mom last night, and he‚Äôd rather not get a black eye. Of course, it‚Äôd be worth it, Sam has been waiting to put Paul on his ass for seven months now, but not today. Not when he has to meet Grace‚Äôs extended family for an early Thanksgiving later. A black eye wouldn‚Äôt make the greatest first impression.

¬†‚ÄúWho the hell‚Äôs in there?!‚Äù Paul asks, slurring his words and angrily shaking the door knob. Sam can practically taste the alcohol in his breath.¬†

¬†‚ÄúSam, I‚Äôll be out in a second,‚Äù Sam growls, holding the door knob in place.

¬†Paul scoffs, ‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô kid‚Ä¶‚Äù He says, walking away.¬†

¬†Sam waits a few moments before unlocking the door. As he opens it, he looks down the hallway to see Paul already raiding the fridge for another beer. While his back is turned, Sam rushes to the front door and leaves his apartment. He slowly closes the door, and lets out a sigh of relief. He keeps his hand on the knob to open it fast just in case.¬†

¬†‚ÄúMaria!‚Äù Paul yells out.¬†

¬†Sam begins to open the door, clenching his fist. Suddenly the black eye and bad impression seem entirely worth it. Before he swings the door open, he hears his mom call back.

¬†‚ÄúYes, honey?‚Äù She says, her voice hoarse from her screaming. Sam lets go, and his heart breaks. No matter what he does, she‚Äôll stay with Paul. He realizes attacking Paul would do nothing. Sam would knock him out, she‚Äôd patch him up, he‚Äôd whisper sweet things and apologies, give her a little bit of his heroin, and then the cycle would start all over again. Calling the police would only make things worse, either she defends him and makes up a lie, or they don‚Äôt show up in the first place.

¬†Sam listens as his stepfather‚Äôs footsteps slowly fade as he gets closer to the bedroom, and eventually disappear. Sam slams his fist against the wall and storms down the hallway.¬†¬†

¬†As he walks down towards the staircase, his jaw clenched and repeatedly balling his hand up to a fist in anger, he slowly comes to a stop. He looks back, tears welling up in his eyes. He doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs looking back for, maybe deep down, he‚Äôs hoping his mom will run out behind him and apologize for everything. He runs his tongue along the bases of his top teeth, and looks up at the ceiling tiles, squinting his tears away. He turns his head back and laughs at how stupid he was. Stupidly thinking today was gonna be a good day. He continues his walk down the stairs and to his car, a beaten-up 1999 Honda Civic.¬†

¬†Sam reaches into his left pant pocket and grabs his car keys, unlocking it. As he sits down in the cloth seat, he reaches over into the passenger seat, unzipping his backpack. He grabs deodorant and cologne out of the front pocket and applies both of them. As he puts them both back, he catches a glimpse of the dead vape hidden deep in the pocket. Staring at it, a heavy temptation takes over. He puts the deodorant and cologne away and zips up the pocket. The temptation grows, but he doesn‚Äôt give in. He quit for Amber, and he won‚Äôt‚Äì *can‚Äôt* let her down. Before he starts the car, Sam reopens the pocket, taking the vape out. He holds it in his hands, the cold metal is familiar and welcoming. His mouth opens subconsciously, almost like he‚Äôs begging himself to do it. He knows how good it would feel, how relieving it would be. Before he can second guess himself, Sam rolls down the window and throws the vape out, driving off.

**II**

¬†The transmission clunks as Sam shifts into park. He gets out of the car, grabbing both his wrestling bag and school bag, slamming the car door behind him as he walks away. As he makes his way through the maze of cars, Grace cuts in front of him, handing Sam his hot cocoa.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHere you go, my good sir!‚Äù She says, mimicking a British accent and handing him the drink as if she were a butler.¬†

¬†‚ÄúThank you, m‚Äôlady,‚Äù Sam responds, also mimicking a British accent.¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou guys are so weird!‚Äù Grace‚Äôs sister, Anissa, giggles.

¬†Sam chuckles softly, ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre just no fun!‚Äù He says, scruffing her hair lightly. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, we're almost late,‚Äù he holds Anissa‚Äôs hand as they walk through the school doors.¬†

¬†Sam stares at Grace as they walk, admiring her. Even through his fake smiles and laughter, she still fills a hole in his heart, she brings warmth, and even if he‚Äôs unable to show it, she makes him happy.¬†",0,1742945929.0,writers,2,0.5,False

1jjxvsn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjxvsn,Four Seaons Koh Samui Review ( White Lotus Thialand),"Four Seasons Koh Samui: A Luxurious Multi-Gen Getaway (5-Bedroom Residence Review)

Stay Details: 6 nights, multi-generational family of 10 (including 2 kids).

Location: The Four Seasons Koh Samui is nestled on the quiet northwest corner of the island, about 45 minutes from the airport and far removed from the bustling tourist areas. This isolation is both a blessing and a curse. If you're looking for seclusion and pure relaxation, it's perfect. If you want to explore the island's hotspots, be prepared for longer drives. There's virtually nothing within walking distance of the resort.

Room: We splurged on a 5-bedroom residence with two private pools, a full kitchen, and a bar area. This was a fantastic decision for our large group. The villa was perched high on the hill, offering stunning views of the Gulf of Thailand and the resort. Be warned, the hills are steep, so you'll rely heavily on the resort's buggy service. The bedrooms are similar to the standard villas, but the residence's expansive living spaces and dual pools were a game-changer. Bathrooms were spacious, though the closets were surprisingly small. A quirky design choice was the lack of doors on the toilets beside the main bathroom door. The main pool in the residence was over 50 feet long, heated, and offered breathtaking views.

Service: The service here is truly exceptional, as you'd expect from a top-tier Four Seasons in Southeast Asia. The staff is incredibly attentive and personalized. By the end of our first day, most knew our names and preferences. One member of our party has a severe shellfish allergy, and every restaurant on property was aware of it, mentioning it proactively at each meal. Our two butlers were outstanding, available 24/7, and fulfilled every request, from morning coffee to poolside cocktails. The General Manager and Resort Manager were highly visible and engaged, even joining us for villa happy hours and birthday celebrations. Buggy service was generally prompt, though occasional waits were necessary. Each group got their own buggy, which was nice.

Food: Food was good, but not quite reaching ""amazing"" status. The Thai restaurant was beautiful and offered themed nights, including a buffet with a local show and a curry night. Breakfast was excellent, but the buffet selection was a bit limited compared to other Four Seasons properties (I'd rate it 7/10). The a la carte menu was a plus. Poolside/Pla Pla lunch was very good, but the menu leaned heavily towards dinner entrees rather than light lunch options.

Overall Impression: The Four Seasons Koh Samui is a phenomenal resort that lives up to its reputation as one of the best in Thailand and Southeast Asia. The service is impeccable, the villas are luxurious (especially the residences), and the setting is breathtaking. If you're looking for a secluded, high-end getaway with top-notch service and don't mind the isolated location and a few minor food quibbles, I highly recommend it. For a large family or group, the five bedroom residence is absolutely worth the upgrade.

TL;DR: Amazing service, luxurious villas with great views, isolated location, food good but not mind-blowing. Highly recommend for a relaxing, high-end stay.",24,1742945736.0,FATTravel,0,0.96,False
1jjxunf,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jjxunf/since_counting_calories_i_almost_feel_like_i_eat/,Since counting calories I almost feel like I eat more?,"I‚Äôve been counting calories since January when I got a food scale for the holidays - some days I don‚Äôt track or mess up, but I generally aim for around 1550 calories based on my height and weight + exercise levels. I don‚Äôt weight myself as I‚Äôve struggled with disordered eating before but all of my clothes fits SO MUCH better and I am feeling so much more comfortable in my body. I estimate I‚Äôve lost maybe 10-15 pounds and hope to lose 5-10 more depending on how I feel. 

The crazy thing is, before tracking my food I feel like I actually had no concept of how much I needed to eat a day and might have eaten less? I would usually eat 1-3 times per day, struggling to have an evening meal after work or even eating really late in the day and then never quite catching up on meals / calories. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had days I binged and likely over corrected since I was hanging on to stubborn weight anyway, but it still feels kind of crazy.

Sometimes at the end of the day I‚Äôm still surprised how many calories I have left and struggle to reach my totals. For example today I had a big coffee and Greek yogurt with berries, peanut butter and a bit of maple syrup. For lunch I had two leftover homemade cabbage rolls. My snack was a protein bar and a banana. I walked a LOT today for work (over 10km) so I still have approx. 650 calories to eat for dinner.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? I feel like I lost my way with health and nutrition ever since COVID‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs great but also a bit sad to just be getting it back now.",4,1742945652.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

We have talked about it but it usually doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere, her response is usually just silence or ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô. I have tried to encourage her to get involved with some of my interests, or learn a new skill with me, or just try random new things to see if she likes them, but she doesn't seem interested in any of that. To put it simply, If I don‚Äôt make it happen, it won‚Äôt happen.

As an example, she expressed an interested in exercising so I introduced her to the gym, showed her all the ropes and spent weeks teaching her how to do the exercises correctly on her own. She seemed to take to it and thoroughly enjoy it, and used to go whenever I went, but I began to notice that she would never go on her own if I had something else on. Now, there are excuses and she rarely even comes with me. If you're not interested, that's fine, but just say that, rather than have me help you through it all for weeks only to just not be bothered.

After many such instances, I have backed off with the suggestions so that she doesn't feel pressured, but I do tell her that I'm always up for trying new things with her or just listening if she wants to talk, but it never comes. If I don‚Äôt hold the reins of the relationship, nothing happens. She will just sit on the sofa, watching Youtube and crocheting for hours, in silence. - Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not belittling it as a hobby, its more that that‚Äôs **ALL** she will do, which means chores or anything productive is all left to me.

I'm worried that she might be depressed. She will get upset about not doing enough, but then won't do anything ‚Äì even when her friends ask her to do something, she will find a million (non) reasons as to why it is going to be awful, convince herself not to do it, and then complain. She struggles to get excited about anything and it‚Äôs always the worst case scenario or obsessing over the negative, to the point where she will create or finds problems when literally none exist.  For example, one morning after getting up, making breakfast and coffee for us both, I was accused of being nasty when I told her not to forget to wear a sports bra - I told her there was nothing nasty about what I had said, and that I certainly hadn't intended that - I have been given the silent treatment all day because of this. There just seems to be no concept of putting in to get out, and it ends up coming across as uncommitted, unmotivated and ungrateful.

With my encouragement, she started seeing a therapist to try and help her understand herself, but she quit after a few sessions. She just ghosted the therapist. At a similar time, again with my encouragement, she went to the doctor to see if she was depressed and was prescribed some¬†antidepressants. But again, she just stopped taking them after a few months. I don‚Äôt understand how someone can claim to be bored or depressed or missing friends, but still refuse to commit to doing anything about it. Her mentality seems to be *I like the idea of it but not enough to actually do anything about it.* There's just no accountability or responsibility or commitment. Even in arguments, she will typically give me the silent treatment, and when posed with a direct (usually yes or no) question, the typical response is ""Well if that's what you want"" or ""Well that's clearly what you think"". Like give me **SOME** input.

Besides being worried about her, I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the situation and concerned about our future. She just doesn't want to look ahead or make any decisions. When it comes to deciding anything, I always have to figure it out by myself. She will never come up with an opinion or preference, so I end up basically saying what we will do. I have tried to talk about it with her, multiple times, and her response is always along the lines of ""meh.""

This is probably selfish of me but I'm starting to worry that her inertia is going to hold me back from my goals and dreams. I‚Äôm finding myself losing motivation and drive in my own interests and also not wanting to get her involved with things, because really what would be the point? And ideas are just met with *""yeah, that sounds cool,""* and that's the end of the conversation. I ask her where she'd want to go and what she'd want to do, but she says she doesn't know.

I don't mean to make it sound like our relationship is bad overall, because it's not. At the day-to-day level, things are fine. We get along well and enjoy each other's company. Our temperaments and outlooks on life are pretty different, but we do have a lot of things in common, and some of our differences are complementary. It's the big-picture, long-term stuff that is bothering me.

Honestly it makes me angry sometimes. I just want to grab her and shake some life into her. She's smart, funny, has the potential to be super creative, and works hard at her job. I am truly at a loss for why she is so apathetic and how I can help her. I know I can't make her change, and it makes me angry that she shows no inclination to even try to change a little bit after I've told her how I feel.

Maybe there's nothing wrong at all and I'm in the wrong for wanting her to be different. I don't care if she's not a super driven type-A person, that's not the point, and I'm not saying having different interests is bad,  I just want her to be able to recognize her own wants and needs and feel comfortable asserting them. I want to stop feeling so **ALONE** in this relationship all the time. It would be amazing to have some common goals and work towards them together. 



So I my question for you all has several parts:  
¬†  
¬†First: Any ideas for how I can help my partner, besides being present and supportive? I simply don't know what she needs.

Second: Are my feelings reasonable, or does it sound like I'm just being controlling and expecting my partner to be more like me?

Third: I hate to even think about this one, and obviously no one else can answer it for me, but if it were you in this situation (and you loved the person), would you stay?



TL;DR My partner doesn't get excited about anything and it's getting me down. She's not interested in planning for the future or trying new things or committing to anything. I'm worried that she might be depressed, but she's not inclined to change her habits. I'm afraid I'll end up putting aside my longtime dreams because of her inertia. However, she's a good person and I love her. I don't know if my unhappiness is reasonable or if I'm being selfish. Any insight on how to either help him or cope with the situation myself is appreciated.

My dad has been experiencing slight prickling sensations and numbness, which started on the soles of his feet, but over the course of the last year more of his leg is becoming affected. He estimates that he has about 50% of the feeling he used to have. As an example, I think he means that it would take double the force of pricking him with a needle before he would feel it.

Other than this problem, he is (quite fortunately) relatively healthy -- he exercises regularly (multiple times weekly, less since this condition), and has a very healthy diet (primarily vegetable based, with plenty of fish/vegetables/protein, little sugar), and about 1 cup of 1 coffee and beer or wine daily.

He saw various doctors and finally got some MRIs which revealed a 4mm pituitary gland tumor, the doctor said it was probably benign because of the small size; also that it was not likely to be the cause of his symptoms.

My (100% layperson) googling of his conditions told me his numb limbs is called peripheral neuropathy, but obviously I'm no doctor and also I don't know to ask the right questions to do a proper diagnosis. If it really is peripheral neuropathy, google says it is not uncommon, with the likelihood of experiencing it increasing with age starting at age 50.

Anyhow, his doctors can't say anything conclusively so I'm hoping somebody out there is familiar with this condition can offer some assistance. I would appreciate any advice, and definitely let me know if there are more relevant/important questions I should be asking, or having him ask his doctor.

They've been fantastic but I'm catching up on most of them and what they're teaching feels redundant and there's not much of a challenge in listening any more. 

But it feels like there's a gulf between those and native Italian podcasts for Italians. I was able to follow Dove Nessuno Guarda pretty well (fantastic show btw), but other things I've tried are just too fast and too idiomatic for me to really follow. I'm watching TV and movies as well and it feels like I have to rely on Italian subtitles a ton.

My doctor said the first thing we should try is amitriptyline, starting at 10mg once a day for a week, then 20 for a week, working up to 30 when we will then check in again. 

I took it last night for the first time  and it definitely knocked me out, and today I had trouble getting out of bed until close to 3pm (I'm a teacher on spring break, thank goodness!) It was the kind of drowsiness which I've only ever felt after taking full strength benadryl, like I knew I needed to wake up but my body felt like lead and my mind just kept getting sucked back under into sleep. Now that I am awake and had some coffee I don't feel as groggy anymore, so that's a good sign. 

Anyway, I want to be hopeful about having a potential treatment plan but after a ton of doom googling about side effects and symptoms of amitriptyline, I'm worrying. 

Have any of you dealt with the fatigue and grogginess and had it wear off? Did you find a dosage where it was helping
your pain? I'm also worried about weight gain, as I'm currently trying to lose weight lol. Did the amitriptyline effect your weight?

John adjusted the burned collar of his uniform, still managing to look dignified despite being labeled ‚ÄúPet-Class Alpha.‚Äù The lizardmen didn‚Äôt torture him‚Äîquite the opposite. They gave him a personal sand bath, a perch with a view, and a translator collar so he could ‚Äúentertain the court with mimicry and amusing Earth wisdoms.‚Äù



He was a living curiosity. And he played his role well.



Behind calm gray eyes and years of practiced diplomacy, John waited. Calculated. Every joke he cracked in their court, every cultural anecdote he told, every time he feigned a confused blink‚Äîwas just a distraction.



His last SOS had gone out three hours before his ship systems failed.



Someone had heard it.



He was sure of it.

Day 74



The palace rumbled and trembled. Courtiers hissed and scrambled, their tall, spined tails twitching in alarm. From his perch in the Grand Chamber, John heard it first: a low, rhythmic hum. Too perfect to be natural. Too powerful to be Az'asak tech.



He stood slowly, brushing dust from his pants.



A bright blue light seared through the glass dome above the throne room. It widened, parting like a curtain, revealing a sleek metallic behemoth descending from the clouds‚ÄîThe Judicator, Earth Alliance's elite diplomatic warship.



And it wasn‚Äôt sneaking in.



It was announcing itself.



‚ÄúJohn of Earth,‚Äù rasped Emperor S‚Äôshakal with a flick of his long, black tongue. ‚ÄúDo you... recognize this vessel?‚Äù



John smiled for the first time in days. ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs my ride.‚Äù



The palace doors burst open in a blast of kinetic wind. Through the smoke strode six soldiers in black and silver exo-armor, weapons in holsters‚Äîbut visible‚Äîand at their center, a woman in a clean white coat with a steel badge: Admiral Reyes.



Her voice rang out, clear and unimpressed.



‚ÄúWe're here for our ambassador.‚Äù



S‚Äôshakal blinked, his crest lowering in deference. ‚ÄúYour kind does not own this world. He was found. He is ours.‚Äù



John stepped forward, brushing past a royal guard who tried halfheartedly to block him. ‚ÄúYou really thought Earth would just let you keep me?‚Äù



The Admiral raised one hand. ‚ÄúShall we demonstrate the alternative?‚Äù



A section of The Judicator‚Äôs hull shifted, revealing a cannon so large it blotted out the sun. It charged with a low, ominous hum and glowing up slowly.



Emperor S‚Äôshakal swallowed visibly. ‚ÄúReturn the human... peacefully.‚Äù

Back on The Judicator



John sipped fresh-brewed coffee from a steel mug, his uniform replaced and freshly pressed. Admiral Reyes stood beside him, watching Az'asak shrink behind them.



‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve signaled more often,‚Äù she said with half grin.



‚ÄúI figured the lizard spa treatment wasn‚Äôt the worst,‚Äù John replied. ‚ÄúBesides, they weren‚Äôt ready for us to show teeth. I just softened them upa little. ‚Äù



She grinned. ‚ÄúYou did more than that. They just requested official alliance talks.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôve got some tips on cage etiquette.‚Äù



They laughed as the stars streaked by. Behind them, Az‚Äôasak glowed quietly, now fully aware of one truth:

1jjx1ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1jjx1ml/cantarella_trailer_analysis/,Cantarella trailer analysis,"I have been seeing a lot of reactions to [Cantarella's latest teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKOfEX8QkyA) and it is a GREAT way of ""*Show don't tell*"" and I'm surprised that a lot of people miss the plot (no memes intended) especially the CCs who reacted to it and didn't catch the small intricacies of what makes this trailer REALLY good. I'm no lore addict and I will simply analyse solely based on this trailer alone referring to timestamps.

**Intro (0:05-1:27)**

We hear drowning sounds with Smoltarella reaching out to something as it build suspense. We later found out at 2:21 that its the knife that she uses to eat the tentacle where the symbolism here is referring to:

>*""A drowning man will clutch at a straw""*   
*-Thomas More (A Rennaisance era priest, perfect reference to Rinascita)*

Regardless she fails and awakens. Is she dreaming? Or reflecting back on her traumatic experience? Its the latter as we soon find out.

We see Smoltarella and her mom sitting on two opposite ends of the long dining table. Why aren't they on the sides when they can be much closer to one another? Its because one is the current Head and the other is the soon-to-be Head of the family and her mother is treating this as full business mode and not a lovey-dovey family meal.

The camera pans over to a long row of dishes, all laced with poisons ready to feed Smoltarella back to back in case she breaks any (as seen in 1:22 where her mom pushes another dish to her).

0:53 Mother walks and as she does, she takes a sip of the food as she is fully trained and immune. She then urges her daughter to continue eating the poisoned food for her training leading us into the next part.

  
**Training (1:27-2:39)**

We see Smoltarella drowning and the previous few seconds made it look like her mom literally drowned her. But the drowning here is to symbolise her battle with the poison that she just ingested because a lot of poisons often have ""choking"" effects due to blood coagulation, loss of oxygen, etc.

1:35 we see her descending back into the poison abyss and its not her first time. The hundreds of other drowned Smoltarellas that we see in the waters shows that she has failed to conquer the poison many times before. A kraken reaches out and tightens further showing that the poison's effect is reaching its peak. This training of a near-death experience this time awakens Smoltarella's resonator abilities and thus her jellyfish awakens. This info tells us that her mother is not only training her in the arts of poison and its resistance, but also to force her to become a Resonator (because before this at 1:17 when she opens her mouth to eat, she had no Tacet mark back then).

2:24 she manages to grasp at the knife and ""returns"" back to the surface taking us through an excellent smooth transition where she was drenched, not because of the metaphorical sea that she drowned in, but her own sweat from the poison's effect. She made it, she survived the poison without needing an antidote this time. Now this is the part that absolutely kills me because a lot of CCs somehow think she's schizo or hallucinating and the mother and maids don't exist. Like wtf? Them not being there is a clear case of *she's successful in her training, the mom and maid are confident she will survive and that she's been passed out from the poison and just woke up from that dish in cold sweat.* Now more confident, in her abilities, she dives back into the poison once more.  


**Meeting (2:39-3:20)**

Cantarella offers a slice of cake which the other party declines. Now of course this is the part where everyone knows that the cake is poisoned and so does the NPCs who later still got poisoned by the coffee. But again some CCs start commenting saying ""Why would you drink coffee from someone who uses poison?"" Their only issue is that they missed another sign of *show don't tell*. 3:15-3:17 shows that NPC looks at her cup, glances over to Cantarella's meaning that she poured them the same poisoned coffee but showed that ""its safe"" by drinking it herself first. Again even if you know that the Fisalias uses poison, nobody is going to expect that they go through such hellish training on themselves. Its like how most aren't going to expect a swordsmith to be immune to slashes and stabbing.

What follows later of course is a showcase of her gameplay mechanics as well as one last showcase of her Tacet mark at the end which everyone is now meme-ing about. 

This trailer is a masterpiece of blending backstory, lore, character growth and gameplay mechanics all while assuming that you are not a 12-year old. People keep asking in other games for ""We don't need a side kick that keeps repeating everything back to us"" and yet people miss the point here because ""Hee hee booba and rero rero"" so I had the urge to make this post.

I think the former owner hasn't used it in a long time, maybe gave up to soon or was too busy....  
  
Took the piston seal off for a thorough descale & cleaning of all the pertinent parts, and put the seal back on upside down, water leaked everywhere! Ugh!  
Then put the seal on right side up, still water everywhere!  Grrr!  
Searched the box of accessories, found the Molykote, rubbed it on the seal thoroughly. Finally no water leaking over the portafilter!!  But I could barely register pressure on the gauge, water was running through the coffee grinds!  
After a couple of pulls, I was pretty close to zero on the dial of my Timemore 78s before I had a fine enough grind setting to get decent pressure without the water running through quickly.  I think the grinder is due for a good cleaning and calibration this weekend.  
I called it a night, the final shot wasn't too bad, but not great, maybe a bit too sour...but I had a big mess to clean up!!  
  
Tonight I got everything set up right. Nanofoamer Pro with milk, 18g of Columbian medium roast, grind just a bit above 0 on the Timemore, did a quick preinfusion, then pulled a 45 g shot, everything worked perfectly, and damn, this Cappucino tastes great!!

This was 2 years in the making, slowly acquiring the equipment over time, first the Brewista kettle, then the Timemore grinder, then the Nanofoamer Pro, a few Avensi espresso cups, and finally the Robot!
