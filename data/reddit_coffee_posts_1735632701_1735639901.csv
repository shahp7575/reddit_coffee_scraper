Living alone for that long however was lonely even though I had a loving second family but I wanted marriage for her to move in with me and to not be alone anymore and when I proposed last year she happily accepted and we kissed and her family were so happy for both of us, and then our supposed wedding came in this past June, and infront of our whole family and friends she said no and ran outside crying, and I just stood there feeling like this was all just a dream but no it was reality. She destroyed me that day, her parents went after her as I stood there seeing all those people whispering and looking at me and I just snapped, I went home and threw all her stuff away that was already there and then went straight to the airport to go to our honeymoon alone because it was expensive as hell and most of the trip was non refundable and I had already lost a lot of money in the failed marriage. 

Her family kept trying to get in contact with me over the next two weeks but I deactivated all my socials, even after I returned home I couldn’t bring myself to see any of them so I even avoided work. I live in a small village where everyone knows everyone and everyone here talks, and ever since that day people made me this evil bastard that forced this innocent little girl into marrying but she heroically saved herself, which is all bullshit I never even raised my voice over her.

Life then went on and I found another lawyer to do my internship with and he was nowhere near as good as my ex fiancés dad but it wasn’t that bad, and they stopped trying to reach out to me and people stopped talking about the whole thing and it felt like it’s just moving on, when suddenly around two weeks ago I was chilling at home alone at night and her dad came over, I of course welcomed him in and offered coffee and he accepted, before we could talk he started apologising for his daughter saying she got cold feet at the last second and refused, and that he too wasn’t proud of her and wasn’t happy about the whole situation, and I told him it was none of his fault and that I’m sorry for ghosting him but it just was painful to be around him especially since she looks so much like him even though I still love him.

He asked me whether I like to come back and work with him even if I just want our relationship to just be a work relationship because he loves me like a son and doesn’t wanna lose that and I told him I’d think about it.

am I the asshole because of how I reacted and should I return to work with him? Any help would be appreciated

I would laugh it off. Yet here we are. The thing is, I value and treasure our friendship. Some days I am shocked when you revealed that you like me. In the way that on quiet nights, your thoughts turn towards me...us. To say that I don't entertain those thoughts would be a lie. Hearing from you makes me ecstatic and often times I can't help but smile as our conversations bounce all over the place with the exception of how we really feel about each other. Because I have danced around it while you have stated that you do care about me. The thing is...you tell me what you did and assure that I'm who you want. I assured you that I am okay and you needn't worry. 

Which brings me to feeling torn. Yes I told you what you meant to me and how certain songs has me thinking of you. That on those quiet nights I want to be in your embrace to feel warmth while letting euphoria take me. Waking up in the morning for coffee and tease about how you should really eat breakfast. On the other side of the coin, I feel confused. Dumbfounded, blindsided. The part of me that understands why you did it knows we never discussed our feelings in depth and where we should go or how to go about it. However the other side wants to close up the walls, keep you at arms length so that hopefully what I feel goes away.

I have always had high pressures as far back as  I can remember.  I broke my first finger at 11 and the ER doc told my dad that my BP was pretty high for my age.  I’m now 48 and I’ve been on more meds then I can count.  

I’m currently on 7 different meds all aimed at lowering my blood pressure.  I take all meds as directed at consistent times.  No luck.  When my doc changed my meds about 3 months ago, we were encouraged for all of 2 days, reaching the lowest reading I’ve had in 6 years.  154/74.  Continued on as directed only to be right back up to my averages of 245/115.

I picked up one of my meds today and he’s increasing it to 4 a day from 2.  Here’s hoping.

I can give specific meds if requested, but I can’t remember them all off the top of my head.  I’ve been on so many different things, I can’t keep them all straight.

I am a big guy now, but haven’t always been.  I’ve been bigger than I am now, but still my numbers are about the same.  I’m 6’4” and 320 pounds, down from 465 2 years ago.  I have never even tried a cigarette, I’ve been drunk maybe 6 times in my entire life and only consume any kind of alcohol maybe twice in a year, sometimes not at all.  Hate the taste so no point unless my back is just to the point of nothing else helping.  I do drink about 1 or 2 partial 1 liter bottles of Cherry Pepsi most days.  I do not drink coffee or energy drinks ever.  Again, the taste trade off isn’t worth it.

Average diet.  I’m not overly obsessed with what I eat simply because I only eat once a day, Sometimes not at all.  My doc is thrilled with what I’ve accomplished the last 2 years.  All the weight loss lowered my A1C 14.8 to 6.7 as of last month.  My good and bad cholesterol are perfect, and the imaging of my heart showed no blockages and only slight thickening of the  left side of my heart.  He has now began looking into my kidneys more.  I have had higher than normal levels since I was young, but all scans showed nothing more than a couple Lipomas.  Doc did new imaging this last month and the MRI was normal, and I haven’t heard about the CT scan yet, but the last one was normal.

Sorry for the long read.  Just desperate for answers.  Knock on wood, I do not feel any adverse affects from this.  I don’t get headaches, I don’t get dizzy, my eye sight was checked 2 months ago, and still have 20/20 vision in each eye, and 20/15 with both eyes combined.  Not even sure what all that means, but I know both docs were happy.  Lol!  I know I’m a ticking time bomb, and I don’t pretend to think it’s okay to walk around with pressures like this, but I don’t know what to do at this point.

As the year draws to a close, I find myself in a reflective mood—thinking about the moments that shaped me, the lessons learned, and the connections that came and went. It’s in these quieter moments that I realize how much I value meaningful conversations and the kind of connection that goes beyond the surface.

A little about me: I’m a writer by profession, which means I spend my days crafting stories, exploring ideas, and occasionally getting lost in my own imagination. Outside of work, you’ll find me experimenting in the kitchen, losing track of time with a good book or movie, and savoring the rare moments of peace in an otherwise busy life. I love the little things—like the warmth of the first coffee of the day or the satisfaction of perfectly timed sarcasm.

I’m looking to connect with someone who enjoys sharing their thoughts, dreams, and maybe even their favorite recipes or playlists. Someone who appreciates the beauty in both the big adventures and the small, quiet moments.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear about your year—what inspired you, challenged you, or simply made you smile. Let’s see where a good conversation can take us.

From the beginning, Ricardo and I were known not only for our business rivalry, but also for a friendship forged in college, where we became inseparable through our rivalry.

Both were pioneers in innovation, but their visions for the future were radically different. I believed in a world where technology would benefit everyone, while Ricardo saw technology as an opportunity to maximize profits, even if it meant sacrificing ethics, people and other companies without measuring efforts.

My family wasn't the most exemplary, I was abandoned by my mother when I was 8 months old, growing up with my father and grandmother. I didn't have enough support because my family would have preferred me to be a boy. Always neglected with phrases like: ""If you were a boy it would be useful to put food on the table but you weren't even able to do that"" I didn't have many friends at school and the few I had never chose me as their first choice for jobs, jokes and everything. I decided to move away from them when I was 8 years old, I started to focus on my studies and show to prove to myself that I wasn't like they said, but I was never that brilliant girl, my grades being average. The worst part wasn't even the grades, but a boy who was a fan in my class, Ricardo Santos.

Always with impeccable grades, all teachers at his feet, with all eyes on him. I felt revolted because whenever he spoke to me, it was to diminish me and make me feel like I was a shadow, saying things like: ""You got a 7? What a shame for you, you're definitely going to be a cleaning lady or something like that."" That's what low-level people like you can do, but I'm a genius, so when we're adults I'm going to let my company's bathrooms be cleaned out of respect for our [friendship]."" I decided that everyone would swallow every word dry with a pinch of revenge, so that each word became a little more wood accumulated to be thrown into the fire and burn everyone who diminished me.


After years of study and hard work, I managed to enter a technology college, it didn't take me long to launch a revolutionary product on the market as a project that promised to change the way people interacted with artificial intelligence. My work was about to become the main industry leader, but Ricardo saw this as an existential threat. Yes, he was also at my college, on my course and once again, in my class. To undermine the trust and image of my work, he came up with a treacherous plan: hire a detective to observe my every move and take photos of my theses, ideas, modifications, EVERYTHING! Someone who presented himself as a talented developer looking for a new challenge needed to study his rival, and that was me...

This detective, someone named Lucas (not his real name), offered to help with my research and began working with me, gaining my trust and learning about my secret innovations, things that had not even been presented to my tutors. Ricardo hoped that Lucas would be able to steal valuable information and, at the same time, sow distrust between me and my team.

However, Lucas didn't count on the fact that my integrity and determination were stronger than he could have imagined. In a few months of working together, I felt more comfortable with Lucas, maybe I had finally developed some kind of feeling for a boy, something I never had the luxury of having. And in a moment of honesty and vulnerability, I shared my dreams and fears with Lucas, revealing how much this project meant to her and how many people depended on my success. Human connection spoke louder than money and betrayal, and Lucas began to feel guilty about it all.

Meanwhile, Ricardo was increasingly obsessed with the idea of ​​defeating me at any cost. He started spreading malicious rumors about me having relationships with influential people in the technology market to promote my project and get the subsidy in a dirty way, while the pressure increased on me with deadlines and bigger concerns. 

Lucas and I were getting closer and closer, going out to cafes, talking about everything, as the months went by, I started to feel something strange, something I had never felt before. When I saw Lucas with that absurdly white smile, his dark skin and his eyes slightly squinted by the sun passing through the window, I felt warm, happy. As I didn't want to confuse things, I approached the subject little by little with light questions like: ""What type of woman are you? Do you like tall or short?"" These are divided between days or weeks so that there is no connection. One day Lucas and I went to a park on a Saturday. I saw that there was no reason to put up with it any longer in silence, as I met around 90% of his standards. When I found the courage to speak up, Lucas received a call. ""Yes, everything is in order. I will send the documentation to you now."" Who was it? I asked and Lucas responded in a completely different tone than usual, he rudely gave me an irritated look and said that I was meddling in matters that would not be any of my business and left me in the park without knowing how to react. , I decided to go back to my dorm and spent the night watching movies.

I noticed that Lucas was strange, distant, quiet, and he was always agitated, offering to help and everything. I started to feel that there was something strange happening with Lucas, I decided that I couldn't allow a teammate like Lucas to get discouraged at this point in the championship, as he was a crucial piece in the project, when Lucas left at 12 o'clock, he asked if I was going to leave for the I had lunch with him, I said I wasn't going to make it but I would go the next day without fail, he left for lunch and I stayed in the room with the material from everyone who was helping with the research, I opened Lucas's backpack and didn't see anything much, when I went to save, a black tip It leaked from the inside of the white backpack, it was a fake fundi, I opened it and saw a folder, photos of me at college, at fairs, my routine, my dorm, my ideas, operational codes, everything there, signed by Ricardo. I felt an enormous weight and it was as if I had been defeated. I gathered my team in an emergency meeting and, together with them, formed a strategy not only to protect the company that was being born, but also to win the battle against Ricardo, he had declared war against my company that will begin to grow.

I didn't tell Lucas that I knew everything, I pretended I was normal, the other day I commented about Ricardo's project looking similar to mine while drinking my coffee. The days went by and I began to worry about Lucas more and more. A few months later Lucas decided to reveal that it had been years since he received attention from a woman like me, who was loving me and that's why he wanted to tell me that, so he said that he would be honest with him and his feelings right after that. He revealed his true identity and his objective there, I pretended surprise and total disappointment with tears and everything, making him look like a stray dog. And before Ricardo could complete his plan, Lucas brought me crucial information that could expose Ricardo's dishonest tactics, and together, Lucas and I decided to act. I wouldn't leave him in Pune, but my main target was Ricardo.

Using the innovation I invented as a weapon, I launched an innovative advertising campaign that highlighted not only my products, but also their ethical values ​​and social commitment. The public response was overwhelmingly positive, and little by little, my company's confidence began to grow as rumors about Ricardo's company intensified.

At the height of the battle, I gave an emotional presentation at a technology conference where I exposed the truths that Ricardo was trying to hide. With the help of Lucas, she revealed documents that proved the rival company's cheating, which revealed how Ricardo's company was committed to social responsibility and ethical innovation at that point in the championship.

Ricardo's reputation collapsed when I openly denounced him for plagiarism, for which he would pay 100 million dollars in compensation or pay criminally, totaling approximately 50 years of sentence, presenting evidence, photos and data. Lucas was imprisoned for 15 years in a closed regime for home invasion, invasion of privacy, misuse of images, digital crimes and many other past crimes. Ricardo's company collapsed with my report on national television and he witnessed his empire falling along with his shares that plummeted. I emerged not only as a winner but also as an icon of integrity in the business world.

From then on, I not only rebuilt my company, but also established a new company culture based on transparency and collaboration. 

Thus, in the heart of the storm, hope and certainty were born that, even in betrayal, it was possible to find the strength to overcome and prosper.",2,1735638687.0,relationshipgoals,0,1.0,False

Medu Vada is versatile and often paired with accompaniments like coconut chutney and sambhar, a tangy lentil-based curry. This South Indian snack is a staple at breakfast tables, festive occasions, and temple offerings, celebrated for its delightful texture and rich taste.

Over the years, Medu Vada has transcended its traditional roots, becoming a favorite across the country. It’s not just a snack; it’s an experience that captures the essence of South India in every bite.

1hqbdnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1hqbdnq/wanna_pass_step_1_read_thiswrite_up/,Wanna pass step 1? Read this.write up,"Took my exam on 12/21
First of all the the exam was hard and i think its supposed to be hard. In most questions i had to eliminate options to get to the correct one. 
4 to 5 ethics questions per block. Cardio was tough. No calculations in biostats which was kinda bad bcz biostat questions are sure points. Minimal pharma questions. 
MICROOOO was so weird ...... in uworld u always get hints like what kind of agar or medium or stain the organism had 
But most questions just explained symptoms of disease caused by the organism thats it no hints. 

One very imp thing nbme concepts are all high yield but the way they ask questions is far different from how the real deal was. On that day it was exactly like solving uworld blocks believe me the long weird question stems was nothing like nbmes. Plus nbmes are bit weird like in nbme 31 there are so many things that are not from FA 

So in my opinion if u score good on nbme it just shows that yeah u have a good prep thats it it doesnt mean the exam will be like this and u are fully prepared.
Its just a assesment
Exam can be harder than that 

DONOT DO MEHLMAN PDFS except for neuroanatomy or arrows. 
Recently i have seen a trend that people have nbme scores in 70z and they fail. And in explanation they tell that they even did mehlman pdfs . Everyone knows that guy has written nbme points in those notes 
People cram it and score high on nbmes and real deal comes harder. And man o man anxiety that day if ur one block gets fucked and then it goes side way real quick.


PREPRATION PERIOD:

Keep ur resources simple 
FA, BNB, DIRTY MEDICINE, sketchy and med school bro insta page for mnemonics and few more insta channels 

Make notes which shorten the stuff 
I see people who make notes and they are soooo detailed that they actually struggle with revising everything at the end.

Some topics like how basal ganglia work simplify it. Or sympathomimetics for which i even had to listen dr najeeb lecture 
So do that.  

Finish uworld dont skip it 
Its really imp that u dont rush it

[FINAL PLAN/ MY ADVICE]

once u end everything. Try to cram up whole FA in 20 days and then revise it in next 10 days. donot. Take first nbme after this. 
Now that u have cramed up FA. Start uworld. 3 -4 blocks each day when u wrong a question see why it happened if u have forgotten the concept revise it if its a craming failure revise that. After every 1000 questions of u world take a nbme and see if the score is improving. 
When u finish uworld for the 2nd time. 
Now u must be left with 2 nbmes and uswas and free 120s 

Now revise FA again 
Weak topics or any stuff u are lacking in 
Take these last final assesments and see where u are weak strenthen that 

At the end u must be getting good scores 
If not 
Ask ur seniors too 
Nbme topics are all high yield 
Revise them in detail

NEVER EVER take assesments in offline mode 
On exam day biggest issue was time.
Give me unlimited time and i can bet i can pass.
But believe me time is crazy fast that day.
U must save 15 mins in every block so that u can go through the flagged questions once again.



ON EXAM DAY: 

Dont eat at night ( so that u dont keep pooping in the exam)

Have a v light breakfast 

Reach prometric centre half hour early 

Bring good food with u 
Less cheese the better 

Cold coffees 

Panadol 

Wear clothes with v few pockets and easy to remove clothes 
U have to remove everything everytime u take a break and it will cost u time.

One of the block is always v weird and shatters ur confidence be prepared for that
In my case it was the first one 


And dont fucking talk to anyone 
I had some stupid fellas who were discussing paper alot. Plz everyone is scared that day 
Imagine u say that this block was easy and somebody find that hard. They might start to freak out.


LASTLY I WANNA SAY IF U ARE GETTING HIGH NBME SCORES 
LIKE 75% 80% OR EVEN 70% 
AND YOU ARE STILL FREAKING OUT AND NOT SURE ABOUT IT 

THEN YOU SHOULD THINK ARE YOU REALLY MADE FOR THIS PROFESSION?
IN EMERGENCY WHEN YOU ARE LOOSING PATIENT U HAVE TO TAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS. SO IF U HAVE A WEAK HEART THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD PRAVTISE BEING STRONG OR START LOOKING FOR OTHER CAREERS. 

MY NBME SCORES WERE MOSTLY NEAR 58 TO 60% 
AT MY LAST NBME I GOT 64
ITS RISKY I KNOW I WANTED TO CROSS 65 HONESTLY 

BUT I COULDNT EXTEND MY EXAM ANYMORE I WAS TIRED PLUS A FEW PERSONAL REASONS.

WELL PLAY FOR MY RESULT AND WHATEVER HAPPENS I AM HAPPY WITH THE JOURNY.
I WAS AFRAID OF USMLE 
I STUDIED 
LEARNED ALOT 
I KNOW FA WELL MOST OF IT 
JUST PRAY FOR ME I WILL BE THANKFUL.

We need a 6th ending to the game.  Don't go on the final battle, don't end it all in suicide... do what the game does not normally allow you to do, drive out of Night City and off into the wilderness to live out whatever life V has left.  Take Johnny with you, after all, at this point you've become friends, you've become accustomed to having him around.  Ripping him out would feel like throwing away part of yourself at this point.

Does Johnny take over? Do V and Johnny merge? Who knows, but they are going to find out together.

""If you can’t beat ‘em… join ‘em—and see what’s out there.""

**Title: ""The Road Less Traveled""**

1. **Leaving Night City Behind**
   * **Opening Scene:** V packs a few belongings—maybe Johnny comments sarcastically about **what’s worth bringing** and what isn’t.
   * **The City Fades Away:** They pass through the city’s **outskirts**, leaving behind the lights and noise of Night City. Johnny might remark that it **feels surreal** to leave it all behind.
2. **Clips Along the Journey**
   * **Driving Through the Desert:** The car speeds along a **lonely highway**, the neon glow of Night City shrinking behind them.
   * **Campfire Conversations:** V sets up camp under the stars, and Johnny opens up about his **fears**—maybe wondering if he’ll eventually **fade out** or **erase her** completely.
   * **Sharing Memories:** Johnny recounts moments from his **past life**, and V reflects on how much she’s **changed** since meeting him.
   * **Music and Laughter:** At a roadside diner, they laugh about **bad coffee** and **rusty jukeboxes**—a rare moment of **levity** in the face of **uncertainty**.
3. **Hints of Transformation**
   * **Mental Overlap:** A scene shows V looking into a **mirror**, but for a moment, **Johnny’s reflection stares back**—hinting at their **merging identities**.
   * **Dream Sequences:** Brief flashes of dreams where their thoughts **intertwine**, blurring the line between **V and Johnny**—raising questions about what they’re **becoming**.
4. **Final Scene—The Horizon**
   * The car **stops at a ridge**, overlooking the vast **desert horizon**.
   * Johnny asks: *“What do you think’s out there?”*
   * V replies: *“Guess we’re about to find out.”*
   * The camera **fades out**, leaving the rest to the **player’s imagination**.

\----

Players get to decide what happens next—do V and Johnny merge, does Johnny fade away, or do they find a cure?

To some extent, that depends on if you believe Vik was correct near the start of the game. Is the Biochip going to overwrite V and replace her with Johnny? He might have been correct, or not, the tech was beyond his real understanding in any case.

Johnny might ask V; ""Are you sure? the biochip might end up replacing you with me in time, and you won't even know it is happening.""

V might answer; ""Yea, I'm sure... if I become you, well... at least I got to live for awhile longer and not die in a junkyard at the hands of Dexter DeShawn. And maybe I've imprinted myself on you so whatever ends up will be a hybrid of the two of us.""",2,1735637474.0,cyberpunkgame,0,0.75,False

“Sure sure “ I say harsh and stern .

My hands are twitching and I’m getting annoyed .The police officers look at me with concern .
”There are going to be two police officers watching the house .They will call you every hour promptly.” The officers stand up quickly dusting their hands of their trousers.I get up hurriedly and open the front door quickly ushering them out . I quickly say “thank you” but it came out like a little squeak.

She looks dazed and her hands are shaking .I feel sorry for this poor lass .We are constantly at this address over her boy .Hes a nasty little boy always leaving Marie covered black in blue with bruises.Just last week her boy broke into the back of the house and trashed the home and beat the crap out of her.
My colleague speaks to her but her eyes are darting everywhere and she harshly says “sure sure”
We take this as a que to leave .As we get up off the sofa to leave Mrs platt .Sherrie gets up to led us out ,I see from the light from the front door marks and bruises all up the left side of her face .
It’s so stark to me .I will never understand how someone can hurt and abuse someone .
Out the front door we go .A sudden bang of the door.
I’m not suprised I think to myself that she dosnt want us about .
As we walk up the path .My colleague sees that our police vehicle has been vandalised .” for fucks sake” I exclaimed
DIC Todd grunts and says with bitterness “ suprised they didn’t nick the wheels off like bloody last time”
I hate going into this housing estate. Not because of the theft and high percentage of police hatred but Becuase of the mothers and their barns that get beaten regularly.80% of violence comes from the Farnely estate .

1hqb4xt,https://i.redd.it/9c2kii97j5ae1.jpeg,Was this mug a bad gift?,"I’m posting this based off of another post I saw and it has me over analyzing a gift I got for my family 5 years ago. 

One year I had these mugs made for my family with cut outs of us making silly faces from our most recent family vacation. I thought it was great. We’re all daily coffee and tea drinkers. I looked for the largest and nicest mugs that could also be printed on. My parents have never once used the mugs and it’s been 5 years. I live with them now and I’m the only one that’s EVER used their mugs. Idk about my brother. My mom made some excuse about them not being dishwasher safe but they are. I just assumed my mom was making excuses bc she didn’t like the picture I chose for her but like none of ours are great. I was the only one taking pictures of us and they all kept making faces at me so I thought it was a great opportunity to showcase the pictures lol 

But now I’m realizing everyone thought it was a stupid mug and I should have just gotten one just for me lol. I put a lot of effort finding the vendor, finding the right pictures, making sure the lighting was the same on all so it looked cohesive. Like I spent weeks on it. AKA it’s tacky but not thoughtless. The tacky is what makes it great (especially when we all can and do buy whatever we want for ourselves throughout the year). I still think it’s funny and one of my favorite mugs. Especially when we all lived far away, I got to have my morning coffee with my family.

After college, I ended up in a grad program that was very highly demanding and that didn't even make me happy, and it kind of broke me. My introversion took over, and I drifted out of regular contact with most of my friends and even became more distant in my romantic relationship. I've been out of that program for a few years now and have recently gone back to school for something more creative. I'm much happier in this new field, and now I'm working on rehabilitating my social side. I'd love to find a friend that I could really connect with and maybe even chat with daily. I'm not a good multitasker so I think the ideal would be one long conversation that we could disappear from for several hours when needed and then come back to it without it being weird (I say this because my partner always feels the need to text his friends back immediately or else tell them what he's doing and why he'll be busy, and the idea of having to always be 'on' stresses me out, though I do like the idea of talking to friends daily like he does). I really hate being on the phone so text-based communication would be ideal lol. 

  
I'm open to friends of any gender/age. I'm bi, and I'm all kinds of LGBTQ-friendly. Like I said above, I always used to like being there for people, so I'm happy to be a source of support or advice for you if you're struggling, or even a mentor-ish figure if you're younger and don't have that sort of thing in your life, but I'd rather do so in the deeper context of a friendship with common interests rather than chatting once as strangers to discuss an issue and then never talking again.

  
I'm an avid reader as well as a fiction writer, with my primary interests being fantasy, science fiction, and horror, (though I read a little bit of everything). I love cats (all animals, really, but cats are the best) and coffee, so I'm basically the stereotypical introvert reader lol. I also like video games, though I don't play nearly as much as I used to; for those, I tend toward adventure games or sims. I have fairly wide music tastes but my favorites tend to be in the rock family, usually either old-school emo-type stuff, folk rock/pop, or metal. I tend to be laid-back and open-minded, and I'm also very sarcastic and love a good sense of humor.

1hqazr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1hqazr0/nonexpert_review_of_davy_crockett_ranch/,Non-expert review of Davy Crockett Ranch ,"Context:
We are not Disney people, so this is all the experience and perspective of an extreme novice. But I used this subreddit to prep for our trip, so I thought I’d pay the kind sharing back. 

We came to Disney as a birthday present for our 7 year old and chose Davy Crockett mainly because we could have separate bedrooms.  We stayed 26/12-30/12. 

The locations near the parks was easy. You do need to watch to not follow the signs for Disney Hotels, which caught us returning at 1045 pm after the fireworks. The drive was probably 10 mins from cabin to park car entrance, plus the 15-25 mins of walking and waiting at lines from car park to Main Street entrance, depending on the time of day you get there. 

The resort design was simple, clean, and nice. It does have a dated feel about it, with physical keys and a kind of ghost town like feel, but with twinkle lights up, it felt homey. Our cabin was in the last loop and the drive didn’t feel too bad. 

The cabins are fully motor homes. The pictures online didn’t give me this impression, so I was slightly bummed when we got there. BUT the cabins were WARM and took care of us well - not critters were spotted, we didn’t hear our neighbors, and we had enough space for our time there. Seriously, those heaters work well!!

The challenges:
The cabin did feel 6-12 inches too short in all directions and on all axis. My husband and I banged our heads on the upper storage cabinets constantly. There isn’t enough room for the coffee table they have in there. The place is just small. 
There’s basically one outlet with one plug in each room, so definitely take a power strip. 
The beds were TERRIBLE. I know, that sounds hyperbolic; it’s not. My kid slept great because we exhausted her and a child can happily sleep on a rock. My husband and I rotated between sharing the double bed and hating each other, taking one of the twins in the kid room, and (the best option) sleeping on the couch. The double bed felt like it was missing a box spring or had been designed to emphasize all movement - it only worked for one person, and even then it sagged and somehow also poked the person relentlessly. It was both too soft and too firm at the same time.
Do the premium cabins come with better beds?  If so, that’s the only way I’d stay at DCR again. 

Other Resort elements:
The pool was fun for a quick diversion. We went after spending 10-4 at the Studios, so it was a great late afternoon treat. The pool is definitely heated, but the space is huge so you are freezing as soon as you as you get out of the water. We grabbed one of the jacuzzi grottos which was super cute and fun, but then ruined us for getting back in the main pool as the water felt way too cold afterwards. The pool was a main selling point for me, and even chilly and with an out of service water slide (I don’t think I could have survived being out of the water to do the slide anyway!), it was a great time. 

The restaurant existed, didn’t make any of us sick, and had food. It was fine, but obscenely expensive for what you get.  We did it the first night only because I wanted to have an assured place to go when we arrived. Later on we did the Grange in Disney Village, which was the same type of food, but miles better and with more variety. 

We used the Trading Post to buy breakfast basics like eggs and croissants because we didn’t do the pick up breakfast. That worked out great. Just remember to buy some butter for your pans. Because we stayed 4 nights, we also got a free cleaning pack, which was sufficient. The single use dish towel did the job, but we should have brought a tea towel and some paper towels. 

Overall:
For our priorities of:
- different sleeping spaces
- self service kitchen
- easy reach to parks

The DCR was great. It was not super comfortable just because of the beds, and that could be personal preference. For those that enjoy sleeping while being abused by inanimate furniture, you’ll be fine!  

If we go to Disney again, we’d go in warmer weather, probably take train, and pick one of the walkable properties with a fun pool, but more because we’d want to experience something new, not because DCR is bad at all. It’s a great set up for families, particularly those who want to go at their own speed. If my kid had heard hotel room doors slamming at 730, I’d have to hear “can we go yet?” over and over and over.  DCR let us be more in control of our stay in our little motor home. 

8/10 overall, and I hope all that’s helpful to other non-experts out there trying to figure out how to manage a trip to Disney.

(20M, 19F)","This Saturday, I (20M) was at a chicken restaurant when I saw a girl (19F). I decided to YOLO and asked for her Instagram, and to my surprise, she said okay! We arranged to meet yesterday, and here’s how it went:

I bought her some coquina and doughnuts, and we went to Starbucks (I also paid for the coffee). We had a nice conversation—she’s Persian, and we talked about linguistics, books, and movies. At one point, her phone rang, and the caller was saved as ""My dear<3."" She took the call and later told me it was a guy who’s toxic and gaslights her. She even made a comment about how guys from ""X"" country (mine) are toxic and gaslighting.

After talking for another 5 minutes, she checked her watch. Thinking she wanted to end things, I asked if she wanted to leave, but she said, “No, we can stay,” so we sat for another 30–60 minutes.

When we finally left the coffee shop, she said it was cold, so I gave her a pair of gloves and a scarf I’d brought just in case. She seemed appreciative. We wandered around the square, and I bought her her favorite ""X"" street food, which she also seemed to like. Afterward, we walked to the metro, took a picture together, and said goodbye.

Throughout the meet-up, I complimented her a lot and said nice things. At one point, I asked why she agreed to meet me, and she said, “You have the vibes.”

Its trunk was gnarled, its roots cracked the concrete, and its branches stretched in every direction, as though it had forgotten what “straight” meant.

One morning, Ethan found himself staring at the tree while sipping his coffee on the balcony.

**“It looks so… messy,”** he muttered to himself.

The branches twisted into one another, some shooting skyward, others drooping toward the ground. It was nothing like the perfectly pruned trees he’d seen in the parks.

That evening, his neighbor, Mrs. Howard a woman in her seventies joined him on the balcony.

**“Beautiful, isn’t it?”** she said, gesturing toward the tree.

Ethan frowned. **“I don’t know if ‘beautiful’ is the word I’d use. It’s all over the place.”**

Mrs. Howard chuckled. **“That tree has been here longer than this building. Longer than me. It’s survived storms, droughts, and everything in between. Its roots broke through concrete to reach water. Its branches grew toward the sun, even when shadows tried to stop them. That’s not messy it’s resilience.”**

Ethan studied the tree again.

He noticed the scars on its bark, the uneven growth, the way its branches seemed to reach for everything at once.

It wasn’t perfect. But it wasn’t trying to be.

`“Trees don’t grow in one direction,” Mrs. Howard continued. “Neither do people. Growth doesn’t care about age or rules. It just happens, in every direction it needs to.”`

The words stayed with Ethan long after Mrs. Howard left. He began to see the beauty in the tree’s chaos and in his own. His career, his relationships, his dreams—they didn’t follow a straight path.

1hqavyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1hqavyo/wondering_where_to_place_furniture_in_this/,Wondering where to place furniture in this Japanese studio... ,"Hi everyone. I could use some help deciding on the furniture placement in this studio. The layout is a bit tricky, and there are no precise measurements apart from the living area size, which is **18.7 tatami mats (approximately 30.3 m²)**. Based on the layout, I’m estimating the wall lengths as follows:

* **Front wall (balcony side):** The longest wall, approximately **7.5–8 meters**.
* **Right wall (angled side):** The second longest, around **6.5 meters**.
* **Left wall:** Significantly shorter, roughly **3.5–4 meters**.
* **Back wall (connecting left and right):** Likely **5–5.5 meters**, forming the diagonal.

[Layout inc. balcony \(section with Japanese\)](https://preview.redd.it/556xldnde5ae1.jpg?width=580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=280d1c6610d3b112715415e99d0ef9cc998cff7b)

The space is currently empty, but here’s what I’m planning to include:

* Queen-size bed
* 2x bedside tables (with lamps)
* Room divider (thinking tinted glass blocks to let light through)
* Shelving unit (possibly doubling as a divider)
* Clothes rail
* Two-seater leather sofa
* Coffee table
* Lounge side table (with lamp)
* Floor lamp
* A couple of tall plants and a few smaller ones
* Lounge chair (probably an accent chair)
* Desk with chair (desk might include a pegboard, possibly integrated into the bed divider)
* Long TV stand (not for a TV, but for a record player and bookshelf speakers)
* Rug
* A few posters

I have a rough idea of the layout but would really appreciate your suggestions or thoughts on optimising the space.

1hqau4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AndromedaCeline/comments/1hqau4d/my_random_questionsthoughts_about_the_luigi/,My Random Questions/Thoughts about the Luigi Mangione Case,"Forgive me for the long post. I just had to get these thoughts out of my head. As well thought out as this murder was, to me there are still some glaring mistakes the shooter made that makes it hard to believe that he was a professional hit. Also, there's aspects of the case that make it hard for me to believe some of the conspiracies out now about more than one accomplice, etc. These are just my general observations and thoughts about all of that.

  
First, I love Luigi. I really don't care if he did do it because given how predatory and murderous our healthcare system is, any regular American would have cause to do what he did. He just (allegedly) beat us to it. I don't think it's his actions are ultimately the answer obviously, but whoever did it I don't blame them at all. And if killer cops, mass shooters,  and white supremacy murderers (i.e Rittenhouse, Perry, etc) can either walk scott free or with lesser charges, then so can Luigi, dammit! They are all bigger terrors than him. And the Feds only have themselves to blame for setting that precedent.

Second, all I write below is ALLEGED if pertaining to Luigi. I may not put it every other sentence but it's what I mean. 

Third, the two shooter theory I'm referring to is something I've been hearing a lot on social as the POSSIBLE defense they could use for Luigi. There are lots of theories about who was actually the shooter, and how much Luigi was involved with this plan. Again all theories, but I was ready to entertain the two shooter theory, and still am to an extent, but there are a few details I'll get in to below that give me pause on that. However there are other details that make me think it's absolutely possible, and if so, it's pretty exciting to see how this will all play out in court. Especially if there's even a shred of chance he could be acquitted on all charges! 

I've broken down what I feel like are the major mistakes from the shooter, that make me not believe he's this mastermind professional. He could have simply been someone well practiced/rehearsed for the murder, but didn't really plan out the before and after to well.  That the get away in general may have been planned to an extent, but it could've also been just luck that he got out of the city as fast and smoothly as he did and we're all giving this guy wayyy more credit than he deserves. Again, as much as I want to believe Luigi's innocence, I also want to keep space for the possibility that he could have indeed committed this crime and let go of the denial about just because I want him to go free really bad. Facts are facts.

  
Anyway, Here are my top three faux pas of the UHC Killer: 

https://preview.redd.it/86xsxbtra5ae1.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=340a4de50c458502276de63425bb2bee788ca72b

**Mistake 1**: According to inditement timeline, the assailant came to NYC on Nov 24th. He checked into the hostel using a fake ID. We get the first images of his face from this interaction. We know later this IS in fact Luigi due to the Fake ID photo matching his face, and the ID name being the same name he gives the cops in PA. Not only that, the man checking in has the same black face mask as the assailant, and while not dressed exactly the same at that moment, is dressed very similarly with a hood over his head and black mask. The big mistake, imo, was not disguising himself from the jump. Why dress the same or similar to what you plan to wear during the murder? They wouldn’t have been able to tie him back as the assailant otherwise if it wasn’t glaringly obvious by his look/apparel. He would have been just some random guy at the hostel at that point. All they knew was that the assailant’s moves lead back to that hostel via surveillance footage, not what he exactly looked like. Also, that was a week before the murder anyway, he had time to adjust his look before than, no need to even hide cloak and dagger style bc no one was even looking for him at that point. He could have worn anything, so many disguises to look completely different. 

**Mistake 2:** On the day of the murder (Dec 4th), the assailant goes to Starbucks about 30min before said murder to get snacks (around 6:17AM). A couple mins later (6:19am) he’s discarding the items in a pile of trash down the street. This is all time stamped. I will admit the timeline of these two events are suspiciously quick. I guess he just hoofed down the bar/water in 1 min or it’s also possible, he only took a few bites/sips then threw it away. But putting that aside, later police allegedly recovered the items discarded, a water bottle and Kind bar wrapper, and **according to them** the fingerprints on the bottle and wrapper matches Luigi. Now, if TRUE, that’s pretty damning to me and ruins any theory that there were two people involved. I know that evidence is not found AT the scene of the crime, but it’s found in the exact path of the alleged killer via surveillance footage. That's too HUGE a coincidence.  Also, they allege to have found a print on the burner phone in the alley that also matches Luigi. If that’s NOT Luigi, then what are his prints doing at multiple points of the specific path of the killer? And everyone seems to agree the Starbucks surveillance photo was the shooter. Unless the plan was to “plant” DNA of Luigi at the scene for some reason? OR the cops could be lying/exaggerating about it being a perfect match? I don’t know. If it does match though, then it doesn’t coincide with the theory that Starbucks guy (The shooter) and Hostel Guy (Luigi) are two different people, or at the very least, doesn’t HELP Luigi’s case all. 

More reasons why you **don’t** Starbucks before murder: 

1. Going anywhere that has surveillance that can place you in and around the scene of the crime before you do the crime, dumb. 
2. Consuming food and leaving the trash in public areas where police can then find and extract your DNA/prints to physically place you in and around the crime, stupid.
3. Not eating at the hostel before you left and getting your snacky snacks prior to the murder, ALSO STUPID! According to the website for the hostel he was at, they offered 24/7 snacks (vending machines) and coffee shop available for patrons. With what he purchased at Starbucks, he could have easily ate something like that BEFORE he left. Why wait and incriminate yourself near the scene of the crime? Why risk missing your target to leave and get snacks? Why risk exposing the greater plan of having two people involved? I just don't get it.

**Mistake(s) 3:** I think the most shocking part of this whole thing is that he was found **5 days** later with **ALL** the evidence to convict him on his person. Highly sus (and stupid) if true, but not completely far fetched if said person was not some mastermind professional hitman in the first place. I’m looking forward to more information from the trial to understand why/how this could have happened. I’m not sure if he COULD even really divulge this given he’s trying to plea not guilty for now. But still, I’m very very curious what the end goal here was and when/if he was planning to get rid of the evidence at some point. **Especially the gun!** I’m under the impression the whole point of printing a 3D ghost gun vs buying one is because it’s untraceable. So why not clean it for prints (or just wear gloves!) then ditch it asap like he did with the backpack and the burner phone?? Why keep it on you when it wouldn’t be traced back to you anyway? 

Likewise, with the Fake NJ ID. Why the hell didn’t he immediately ditch that ID (Mark Rosario) and name he was using in NYC as soon as he got out of the city. According to the PA cops, he gave them the same name, which is the one he used in the hostel. I could be wrong (can't remember where I heard it),  but I think that’s what ultimately is what made them sure that he was the guy since that was the name that was flagged as POI (Person of Interest) from the hostel. My question is why the hell would he keep using the same name?? Apparently he had other fake IDs (I think), so he could have used any one of them or even his real name at that point to throw them off. Why use the same name you were using that could have linked you to murder? I think that’s exactly why NYPD didn’t release the hostel name during the 5-day manhunt, because they were hoping he would trip up and use it along the way so he could be flagged, since they didn’t have a clear image of him. But the hostel photos were out. So they had to know his name too. He shouldn't have kept using it!

BUT, on the flip, (just my theory) I wonder if he (Luigi) even **KNEW** about the hostel photos/manhunt. I don’t think they found any kind of smart phone on him (he tossed the burner one). Also possible there wasn’t much WI-FI on the run. So maybe couldn’t connect to social or news to see what was happening in NYC. So it’s possible he may have not known how intense and infamous the manhunt was since he probably disconnected those few days. Reason I also speculate this is because when they found him in Altoona, PA., not only did he have ALL items tying him to the murder, but he was also **DRESSED** the same. Only difference is he had on a tan knit cap, but he was wearing the same black mask and same black hooded coat. IF he truly did it, that’s incredibly dumb to walk around in the same murder clothes, with all suspicious items tied to the murder, and using the same **NAME** as well. A pro would have dumped ALL of it, clothes, shoes, gear, **EVERYTHING** the second he had a chance. You had 5 days, you mean to tell me they didn’t stop once during that bus ride (or possibly train ride)? You couldn’t stop to get a quick change of clothes at a gas station or better yet, **HAVE** a change of clothes on you in that backpack with all the other stuff? A change of clothes/disguise to drastically make you look different. Completely different color and style than what you wore to murder? A wig? Some glasses? Something????

With all that planning and precision, it’s bonkers to me that he would be that sloppy before and after crime. The murder was flawless. The assailant was chillingly calm, cool, even when the gun jammed. No panic or hesitation or nothing. Felt well practiced and rehearsed.  That tells me either he was not this sophisticated professional we thought he was. That at best, the murder its self was just very well practiced/planned up to a point, but the rest was just luck or on the fly. Since he was stuck on a bus while on the run, maybe he had not yet realized how big this got, that his face was everywhere and they had already tied him to the hostel. When he got to bum-f\*\*\* Altoona, he assumed he could still fly under the radar as is even as the cops approached. Just speculation, but it’s possible. OR I this is a wrong take and there’s some greater scheme to this, some greater plan that will reveal its self in due time. If so, they got A LOT of explaining to do, bc WTF??

  


Now, above I went through my gripes and concerns for Luigi's Case. Below are discrepancies from the prosecution that could HELP his case if handled right:

**Up to Midtown Travel Time:** The time of him going from Uptown (Hostel) to Midtown (Hilton Hotel) doesn’t make any sense. First, there are some different variations of this timeline. Some say 6 min some say 30 min ( like Wikipedia). I’ve been looking at different timeline articles and it seems hard to determine how long it took him exactly to go from the hostel to that part of time. Per the inditement however, it looks like they indeed put 6min because the time stamps on the surveillance photos says as much. However, per people who live in NYC and most maps that mapped out the route, it takes at least 20-30min in a **CAR** let alone riding a bike that distance. So that doesn’t make sense how he got to that side of town so fast. That’s part of why the two accomplices theory could make sense. I’m not sure if they will address this in court, but I hope so. 

**The Burner Phone:** Burner phone convo video is interesting to me. There’s surveillance footage of him talking on the phone shortly before the murder (6:30am). I’m very curious as to whom he was speaking to.   Anyway, this also feeds the two accomplices theory, because it’s possible the 2nd accomplice was communicating with the Luigi, or it could have been them saying goodbye to someone or giving an update or checking a voicemail. Who knows, but that part of the evidence was interesting and I hope to know more.

**The Gun:**  Flip side to what I wrote above, it’s still possible that either he **DID** discard the gun or if there are two accomplices they both had a gun. They keep saying the gun they found on him is “LIKE” the one used, shoots the same 9mm bullets, but they seem to be careful to **NOT** say it is in fact THE same gun. Not sure if they’re still testing it to know for sure or if they just can't prove it is, but it just strikes me as weird that they have not yet officially confirmed it as the murder weapon. If it's not the murder weapon, what was he doing with a 3D printed gun that coincidently a similar one was used in a high profile murder a state away? Why would they need two separate guns anyway? Were there other targets later on?

**Fingerprints NOT DNA:** Currently, there’s conflicting information about what DNA evidence they actually have. They have fingerprints, some reports said **BEFORE** they caught Luigi, that they are ‘smudged or partial’. Once they arrested Luigi though, all of a sudden they were a perfect match to him. That’s sus. We will see if it's admissible in court, but that sounds like they are trying to say it matches but really it’s not conclusive or definitive. I hope it's not, because that to me is the most damning piece of evidence against him. There’s also conflicting reports on the DNA from the water bottle. Some say it’s just fingerprints on the bottle and others say actual DNA. Again, I guess we have to wait for court to determine what’s what for sure, but I def think there’s room to doubt what they have as conclusive.

**The Money:** Apparently, when they arrested Luigi in Altoona, they found a couple thousands of dollars of US and foreign currency on him. However, when they were in court, he disputed the validity of that, saying that money was NOT his and he wasn’t sure if it was planted. Since I’m biased to Luigi, I would automatically believe him. Like why would he only deny that and not to rest of the stuff they found on him?? However, the boy did lie about his identity at first, so may have to take what he says with a grain of salt too. But I just also found that interesting that of all the things the money was his biggest gripe he had. But also brings in doubt about the validity of what the police say they found on Luigi. Which seems to be miraculously all the evidence on a silver platter.

**No Bike:** Along with not 100% sure about having the murder weapon, they also were not able to retrieve the bike the assailant used to flee the scene. With all the massive search throughout the city, NYPD were still were not able to locate his bike he used? Interesting and a fail on their part. The supposed most expensive and greatest police dept in the nation.  I'm curious if he gave it away to someone or he left it and it was taken before they did the search. I don't know. I just find it interesting the they haven't found that yet.

  
Their will probably be more, but those are just my thoughts so far. Please feel free to debate what I've wrote so far and add your own thoughts. But please be kind. Again, not against Luigi at all, just have questions.  Thanks for reading if you got this far!",1,1735635387.0,u_AndromedaCeline,1,1.0,False

1hqarfx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqarfx,"[Multiple Games] 12 platinums this year, my thoughts ","As you can see, I don't have too much time or even energy to spend on 100%ing games but I do it for the ones I enjoy and this year started off no different- 

#1 **Monster Hunter World:** This game was the reason I even bought a PS4 all those years ago. Six years later, I decided it deserved a platinum, as it's also the game I got my first trophy ever in. One of my favourite games of all time, I can't wait for Wilds to no doubt take it's place. 

#2 **The Artful Escape:** I'm a sucker for a short story based experience and this definitely delivered. Easy peasy platinum, outrageous visuals, good story. 

#3 **Elden Ring:** After getting the platinum on the PS4 version last year, I started fresh for the DLC and achieved it again. Always a joy to play and explore. 

#4 **Rise of the Ronin:** I played this after watching my boyfriend beat it. Team Ninja combat stays perfect. I enjoyed it much more than I expected to, loved the interpretation of the historical figures, and the platinum was a breeze. 

#5 **LA Noire:** I had the urge to play an old favourite from when I was a 360 kid and I'm glad it more or less holds up as well today as it did then. Still infected by Rockstar's complete lack of respect for your time, but less than their own games. 

#6 **Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty:** Although I liked Wo Long a lot, I did find myself bemoaning the fact that it was so much like Nioh but worse. Some bosses were very memorable, others were borderline unfair. Great setting and level design, combat flawless, it just felt a little lesser to me somehow. 

#7 **Vampire Survivors:** Serotonin simulator. I was seeing orbs for weeks in my sleep. 

#8 **Dragon Age: The Veilguard:** Apparently it's a hot take to love this game, but as a diehard Dragon Age fan who has played since Origin and reads the novels, I feel it slots into the series nicely. While some dialogue is definitely a bit cringe, enough to almost pull me out of the fantasy, it always brought me back in. Gorgeous game. Very emotional for me. 

#9 **Lies of P:** I have a post about my thoughts on Lies of P elsewhere, but let's just say it's a top 5 soulslike and I doubt any will take it's place soon. Even though it wasn't released this year, it was probably my favourite game I played in 2024. 

10 **Coffee Talk:** Short, sweet coffee brewing simulator. I kind of wished there was more impactful choices but episode two made up for that. Lovely to play just before Christmas.

11 **Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus and Butterfly:** This was more in line with what I wanted. Making the wrong drinks actually makes a difference and there's a couple of different routes and endings for multiple characters. New characters were super likeable, felt familiar and cosy. 

12 **Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion:** Quirky, quick and fun, but a bit too ""memey"" for me. I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing, really. The actual story is kinda of messed up though. Interesting experience. 

That's it for my 2024 in platinums! There's not many but I'm satisfied with them. I hope you all have a splendid New Year 🎊❤️ ",9,1735635035.0,Trophies,2,1.0,False

I feel like I have everything I need between the grocery list and what I already have. But I also feel like I'm forgetting things. Realistically if I absolutely need something I have a pharmacy and grocery store both within 5 minutes of where I live. I definitely would prefer to be overprepared though as there are some days I probably wont have help for a bit. I know the first 3 days I'll have my mom as she is flying in for those days. My boyfriends work schedule is unknow for awhile so I want to make sure I have as much as I can. We live together so at the very least he would be home evenings and nights.

Light to medium roast mostly. Can't stand the ashtray notes of dark roasts. 

I make and drink more coffee at work than home, so portability is on the list.
Done my research, now stuck with 3 items in the basket…

Ode Gen 2 is currently under £300. Might be a bit pretentious electric grinding beans at work, but there are quite a few of us coffee geeks hand grinding there. Reasonably portable to bring home for weekends.

1zpresso K-Ultra £230ish AND/OR 1zpresso ZP6 Special £200ish. Hand grinders give more portability. Can take 1 on holiday.

Feel the 2 hand grinders would give me more flexibility and options.

Or buy the K-Ultra and see if I want more clarity after. Will I really notice it over my current Timemore C3esp?

My palate has been surprising me recently,  enjoying lighter roasts and wanting more clarity to be able to taste the tasting notes better.

Stuck on this idea of conical burrs in the hand grinders vs flats in the Ode. Should I care in this instance?

Don't really want to spend more. Don't like the idea of immediately swapping to SSP burrs. I think getting all 3 would be crazy and create budget friction at home….

I have a healthy diet but it’s pretty limited. For some reason I just have zero desire to eat new foods. I don’t even want to put it in my mouth and taste it. I try not to be rude, but if anyone offers me anything I pretend to be thankful and give it to my boyfriend or someone else later. I feel like a lot of it stems from the fact that I hate meat. I’ve started eating chicken recently but the thought of any other meat (as well as some chicken) is repulsive to me. 

I can get by in life as is because I enjoy a lot of vegetables, beans, tofu, etc, but when I travel I always feel embarrassed at how little desire I have to eat different things. I guess my issue is that if I don’t 100% want it, I don’t feel the need to eat it. When people get sweets out at a coffee shop or something with me, I don’t want anything. I feel like it comes off as judgmental and like I’m doing it for health reasons, I just have no desire to eat it. Is the best way to fix this just forcing myself to eat things? I’m sure I can do it without spending too much, but I have a hard time justifying spending money at the grocery store or at a restaurant for something I don’t really want. Any peoples experience would be appreciated, I’m sure I’m gonna get called childish and spoiled for saying I’m a picky eater though lol",3,1735634205.0,IWantToLearn,6,1.0,False

What if we put our amount in “daily coffee” ($5) into our credit card while still making that larger monthly payment?  

Clearly it would help bring down the credit balance but is it harmful in anyway? Right now I am making a large payment each month and have improved my credit from where I started, so I know that I’m doing that part right but I saw the “daily coffee” idea recently and wanted to dive more into that and see if it’s worth doing.

At this point I am not sure why I am still on this app as it has become useless now.
It is impossible to search for anything and find what you're looking for. The results are filled with pins you were looking at a few seconds before the search. Pins that are completely irrelevant to the search. 

If I pinned a picture of a Townhome and searched for coffee cups, they will fill the search with that same townhome picture, AI townhouses and lots of ads. If you get some relevant pins then it is always AI. What is worst is that it is the same 3 AI pins that will be repeated over and over again in your search. It is so insane because I will hit hide pin due to irrelevancy and will find the same AI pins 5 times when scrolling further smh. 

You used to be able to find exactly what you were looking for on this app.
Even the similar pins recommended under pins have nothing to do with the pin in question. It's all a repeat of your feed with loads of AI and ads.

Exactly what is the purpose of Pinterest now? Pinterest is officially irrelevant and useless to me. Just a few years ago, it was the best place to find great interior design inspiration, fashion inspiration, cooking recipes and etc. Why are they destroying their own app? 

Even this year, I tried to look for fall/winter fashion inspo and had to eventually quit because it was the same pins on repeat with loads of stuff that had nothing to do with what I am looking for.

Have the people at Pinterest been replaced with AI? Are there any human employees left there? Nothing makes sense anymore and at this point I get so frustrated I want to quit. It feels like a computer is in charge of everything there now. ",3,1735634089.0,Pinterest,1,0.81,False

1hqaio8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestationSP/comments/1hqaio8/motivation_for_those_questioning_signs/,Motivation for those questioning signs,"Since I started manifesting my SP, I always felt like whenever I see a car like his or something that reminds me of him that he’s thinking of me or we getting closer somehow. I am also spiritual and we have common beliefs. Well I arrived at a point where i was starting to feel like my belief system was not true, until today.

So today, I kept seeing a car that looks similar to the one my friend’s crush drive. This car is pretty rare in my area so it stuck out to me, and it was oddly the exact same color as her crush car too but it was not him driving it. When I noticed this, I asked myself “is her crush talking or thinking about me?” I didn’t think about it too much because it wouldn’t make sense as to why he would talk about/think about me when I hardly knew or even spoke to him, we just had a mutual friend, so it felt silly to even assume that yet part of me believed still. Guess what happened later that day? My friend FaceTimed me, saying that he has a cousin that’s interested in me and that this cousin would like to meet me? Apparently he told his cousin I was single and talked about me (keep in mind I am not familiar with my friends crush at all, she just talks about him to me)!

This was such a weird thing but it is a major sign that I am indeed the creator of my reality, even if it means manifested this occurring in itself rather than it being a sign!!!

Here some other I asked the universe for several signs of my SP manifestation coming true: 

-A stray orange cat since it’s quite rare to see them, I ended up seeing one a week later.

- A stray dog : I know this would be quite difficult as I have never seen one since moving: I literally saw one about a week later.

- A free latte. I love lattes so I wanted this one badly when I manifested it. I thought about it everytime I went to the coffee shop but it didn’t happen. Today I got the random urge to go to buy a coffee at this new coffee shop even though I had not planned to. So I just followed my gut, and ended up getting a large latte on the house!

One thing that I will say is common with these signs/manifestations is that it happened when I stopped thinking about it, or when I forget about it. My mistake was putting a time frame to it, like h asked the universe to grant in 48hrs and it happened a week later instead, the coffee took about 2weeks since I dwelled on it the minute I thought about it. I’m pretty sure it’s confirmation that time is nonexistent and that patience is key. 

These are just reminders from the universe that all we desire happens when we detach fully.
