(for people that didnt saw the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NianticWayfarer/comments/1n5rg5n/small\_family\_owned\_coffee\_shop\_worth\_trying\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NianticWayfarer/comments/1n5rg5n/small_family_owned_coffee_shop_worth_trying_to/) )

Secondly, i went back and took more pictures. Please let me know if these are better, and if so, which ones would be more suited to use in the submission. Unfortunately, since its still summer here and sunny every day during the time the shop is opened, i cant do much about the reflection of the main window. Ive tried a couple of angles that dont show it that much. Some close ups and also some wide range shots.

It was pretty funny the owner came out and asked me why i was taking pictures; i knew it was going to happen, it always happens to me. He was just curios, and we had a small talk about the shop.

Also, any suggestions you have about the texts and such for the submission, id gladly read them.

Here’s a description of my book. 


Three women have spent 11 years perfecting the art of ""everything's great!"" while secretly wondering if anyone else’s lives feel like they're being held together with coffee, dry shampoo, and sheer determination. Amara has become the Pinterest-perfect mom who's quietly losing herself somewhere between organic snacks and color-coded schedules. Reese projects unshakeable confidence while hiding the fact that the untold truths of her past nearly broke her. Lainey is the sweet, accommodating friend who's been slowly suffocating in a life that looks good on paper but feels wrong in her bones.

They make an attempt to reconnect through a long overdue mom trip to Costa Rica. What starts as much-needed girl’s vacation, becomes an unexpected reckoning. Somewhere between the poolside laughs, and late-night conversations, the carefully constructed versions of themselves start to crack. Years of ""I'm fine"" crumble under the weight of what they've actually been carrying. they've all been drowning in different ways, just really quietly, while maintaining flawless appearances.

This is what happens when women finally stop performing their lives and start living them—embracing the ugly crying, uncomfortable truths, and the kind of friendship that can handle both your worst moments and your most unhinged 2AM thoughts. It's about learning that the strongest foundations aren't built on perfection, but on the courage to be authentically, unapologetically human with the people who matter most.

Now, I have some very maybe ""basic"" questions on the logistics, this will really help me so thank you so much in advance! (as you have already helped me tons with the study and I'm feeling good):

1. There's this[ Pearson VUE Demo](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-takers/demo-test.html), how close or different is the exam to this?  
2. Which tools do we have available? (highlight text, strikethrough, calculator?)  
3. Do the exam automatically stop after 60 questions for the breaks, or do we ask anyone for it?, how's the logistics of the breaks?  
4. Can we have like a Water Bottle while we go through the Exam?  
5. I hear some of you had headphones while on the test, is this global or only a regional practice?  
6. For the questions, do we have a countdown like: ""Time Remaining"" and a ""Question 30 of 175"" or similar?, thinking on this to do a correct pacing and don't get unnecessary stress about time  
7. Would you recommend (or not) taking coffee just before the exam? (will be 7 am)  
8. Any additional tips you would have specific to presenting the PMP in person?

Martin rubbed his eyes, the late night letting itself be known in his head. The schematics in front of him reminded him of bad memories sometimes, and he liked to go for a break when they did. But he'd not go for a break, neither now nor later. He was far too busy for that; there were far too many things to do.

Damian basically ordered him to hole himself up in here since they've come from the factory raid. He told Martin to just sit tight and create as many new weapons as he could, to improve Viktor's Spike and whatever else he could think of. If only that was so easy. He'd managed to create some new, small gadgets that helped, sure, but nothing groundbreaking was popping up in his mind these days. And the secret behind how Viktor's implant worked still didn't reveal itself, the way to make it work for others still a mystery.

He stretched, doing his best to fight the yawn that was sprouting in his mouth. And then jumped when a call popped up on his screen, the picture of Nataly waking up his dazed mind. He picked it up on the third ring.

''Hey Martin, you asleep?''

He groaned. If only he could sleep, let his mind daze away for hours on end. If only the whole future of the city didn't hang on his shoulders. ''Wouldn't be talking to you if I was. What's up?''

A pause, and then Nataly continued in a quiet voice. She sounded almost as tired as he probably was to her. ''Well, I can't sleep. Got another ambush scheduled for tomorrow. Too nervous. Thought that you're probably holed up in your lab, wide awake, so I thought that maybe we could get some coffee? A quick break, you know?''

Nataly, nervous? Well, there was a first for anything, it seemed. He'd never seen her nervous before a fight, at least not to the extent that she needed to talk to someone about it. ''Sure, ten minutes?''

''Sounds good. Don't be late.'' And with that, she hung up. Martin straightened, quickly sprayed his armpits with some deodorant, and went out of his manhole. It seemed that he'd not spend another night alone, at last. Even if it was just an hour, it was an hour with a friend. That counted for more than he'd thought it would.

Nataly avoided looking him in the eyes whenever he tried making eye contact. The hot steam was coming off from their coffee cups, intertwining in the air between the two Decks, it's fragrance making the quiet hall seem even more serene. Martin really thought that she sounded nervous, but looking at her now, he had to admit that he wasn't right. She didn't look nervous. She looked terrified. He could see how her eyes were widened, how she took in gulps of air in a rapid rhythm, how she continued fiddling with her mechanical fingers. She couldn't even start a conversation, even though she called him here. Martin felt himself grounding his own emotions. He'd be here for her, even if she decided to push him away.

''You okay, Nataly?'' He watched her, watched her expression. She looked to be in the dining hall, sitting next to him, yet somewhere completely different at the same time. She didn't even respond for the next few seconds, as if she overheard the question, but then her eyes glistened and she finally snapped back to reality.

''Would you be okay? In my shoes? After fighting those things?''

''You looked to be holding your own against them, though.''

Nataly raised her voice, anger and fear mixing in a tone he'd never heard from her before. ''I've almost died more times than I could count, Martin.'' She huffed and paused to take a sip of her coffee.

She looked so small, then, like a normal woman, a normal human. Scared of what she didn't know. He wouldn't want to fight the things again, he had to admit. He felt relieved when Damian told him and Viktor to focus on research instead of fighting for the time being. He almost died on that battlefield, no scratch that, he would have died if it wasn't for Viktor and Kern. So even if he didn't want to admit being scared to himself, he did understand. He'd not help her by telling her how she outmatched almost anything the Ristards could throw at them. She needed a different kind of support.

''We all almost died there, Nataly. I guess we did die, in a weird, metaphorical way. Our idea, that we're fighting against something that is human, or robotic at least, died back there, in that factory. I don't know if that's the worst thing they've got, but probably not. Shit, there are more things I don't know than I do know these days, and every time I leave this base, I get confused by yet another.'' He grasped her shoulder, looking her right in the eyes. ''But you? Half of the Decks treat you like you're the leader instead of Damian, Nataly. And you will be leading. It's a big responsibility, but if anyone can do it, it's you.'' He watched her as her eyebrows got higher in surprise. ''You're going to be fine. I promise you that.'' He lifted his pinky finger, doing his best not to think of the last time he'd made a similar promise with someone.

Nataly looked incredulous. ''A pinky promise? What are we, five?'' But she laughed, the quiet giggle carrying far in the quiet hall. Martin didn't lift his hand, and instead of her pushing it away, she actually leaned into him, laying her head on his chest from the side. Martin did his best to not show how nervous he got all of a sudden.

''The thing I fear the most is, what if I fail. What if I die somewhere, in a fight that doesn't even matter that much. What happens then? Who avenges my gang, my family?''

Martin took a deep breath, and squeezed her even tighter. ''If you have no choice, then just run. Abandon them.''

Nataly pushed off, surprise plain on her face once again. Seemed like she didn't anticipate his thoughts. ''What do you mean? Abandon them? This coming from you?''

Martin took a long sip from his coffee cup, taking time to collect his thoughts. ''You're worth more than them, Nataly. To me and to you both. No one will be here to avenge them if you die. And there will be no one as powerful as you when we take the fight to the Ristards. So yes. If you have to, just run. I would...'' Martin exhaled. Even he knew how terrible, how cowardly was the thing he was about to say. But he'd say it anyway. '' I would rather someone else bite the dust than you, Nataly.''

The only sound audible in the hall for the next minute was the sipping of the coffee. And then Nataly smirked, her stress visibly leaving her body. ''Is that a confession?''

Martin laughed, only just realizing how what he'd said must have sounded. ''Wasn't planned, and I didn't want to confess in the most awkward, unromantic and round-about way possible, but sure, let's say it was.''

''Dummy. I would say yes no matter how you asked me.'' Smiling calmly, Nataly leaned against his chest once again. Martin stroked her hair, finding the movement weirdly calming. ''You know, Martin, I'll pretend you didn't say all that. Probably wouldn't be the best for the soldiers' morale. But... Thanks. I will consider your suggestion if push comes to shove.''

''Yeah, deciding your life is worth more than someone else's doesn't sound pleasant, I get it. But I think that's how we all feel, deep down inside. Also, I'm sure you've already got a better plan than the one we went with in the last factory, right?''

''Yeah, a safer plan than last time. More cautious on all sides. And quiet now about philosophy and other stuff that you love to babble about. I just want to... stay like this for a moment.''

And with that, Martin just leaned on the table for support, and stroked Nataly's shoulder and hair at all moments, doing his best to just be there for her. It wasn't even a few minutes later that he noticed her body sagging visibly, her head drooping into his lap. It seemed like, somehow, she was even more tired than he was. Chuckling quietly, Martin just watched her face, how her facial muscles drooped in sleep. And then he, as carefully as he could, picked her up and started walking toward her room.

The room wasn't that far, thankfully. And Nataly, with her new augments, wasn't that heavy either. She felt light, actually, lighter than her metallic parts would make one think. A few minutes later, he laid her down in her bed, pulled her blanket over her, and after a solid minute of hesitation, placed a kiss on her forehead. He was sure she'd come out on top tommorow. If anyone had a habit of surprising the people around them, it was Nataly.

Martin turned to left, but he noticed a pen and a paper notebook on the table. Smiling, he knew what to do. Before leaving, he left her a message she'd find in the morning.

And then he went back to his schematics. The gods wouldn't kill themselves by their own doing, after all. He'd have to be the one to create a machine that could do so.",1,1757195914.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1nabyym,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1nabyym/weight_gain_post_wegovy/,Weight gain post Wegovy,"Hi everyone!

I’m going to be completely transparent in this post. Started Wegovy in September 2023 and now it is September 2025. I lost 110lbs the first year (about 45 of those pounds were pregnancy weight gain I was losing), and from September 2024-2025 I have maintained at 120-125lbs. 

As far as diet, I didn’t change anything 😬 Granted, I have 4 kiddos and we eat healthy, but I have a little fancy coffee addiction, will order a delicious sub on DoorDash when it sounds good. I like pizza lol I honestly just lost the weight without doing anything except taking my shot each week. 

With that being said, since I have maintained for a year and my body has had this time to adjust to a new baseline (and even longer as I start to plan to get off), I want to know opinions on how to keep the weight off.

This isn’t a “keep doing what youre doing” answer since I never changed anything and don’t have “old ways” to return to, except probably portion control. Which is honestly going to be hard to control without the medication! 

I wanted to see what people thought about me dedicating the rest of 2025 to cutting out my not so good habits and giving myself adequate time to build new ones. So when I come off I am in a solid place. Increasing my portions when I come off without increasing calories seems logical in my brain. I just want to train my brain first. The only downfall is I am a handful of pounds from being underweight and I don’t want to do that. I need to stay where I am. 

Aghh any suggestions will help. ",1,1757195749.0,WegovyWeightLoss,1,1.0,False

1nabxsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nabxsw/mixed_signals_unsure_what_to_do_from_here/,Mixed signals. Unsure what to do from here.,"Will keep it as short and to the point as i can. I (31M) met this girl (28F) i like since he came to my office on a temporal basis from April to June. To provide context: i´d always been an overtexter (really deep social issues, so used the Internet as a buffer instead of deepening potential connections face to face) but i´ve already learned my lesson that it´s a huuuuge turnoff and generally women dislike texting unless there´s some level of trust already there or interest (family, close friends, partner, etc...). So i had patience, with her and the rest of the colleagues as much as i could during coffee breaks and communicated by being there in the moment. Finally her time came to an end and summoned up the courage to ask for her number when i knew it might be my one and last chance (HUGE progress for me compared to my past). After a week and something passed i asked her out- voice message, not texting- to go hang out for coffee, just the two of us. Surprinsingly she said yes; even more surprising, she showed up at the arrangedd time and place (if only you knew the amount of ghosting i had to put up with...). It was really nice, good conversation and went for a walk afterwards. As far is i can tell it went great. She even read a short story i shared with her realtively fast and sent me her thoughts quite fast without me pushing for it; just the next day.

Here´s the tricky bit. From that point forward, there hasnt been a 2nd one, even though she said we´d keep seeing each other. She went to holidays to her village during August- nothing weird there, loads of people do that during that time in my region, since its the local festivities everywhere, and there´s no reason that she would lie about it. She claimed that she would let me know when she was back in September to see each other again. So far nothing.

  
Am i overthinking this too much ? Must clarify that i´ve been using the ""texting is for arranging, not to know each other policy"". As i said, too much experience of how that never works and the silent rejection that it entails (yeah, i now see too late how you can come off as needy, when your not someone important for the other person yet). So i went the full month with no texting, just focusing on my life, activities, holidays and hobbies. I think the fact that there´s interest on my part is more than clear now and she reciprocated to some degree. My is wether i should wait out another week, etc.. to text back (even is just a ""how was your holiday?"") or keep waiting for her to initiate. Worried that if i go for ther former, it would feel like i´m overpushing for something i´ve already stated and hurting my chanced even further. But the alternative might be paradoxical and me not texting might make her feel i´m nor interested anymore. 

Just my POV. As said. i used to be the guy who never dared, so lost a lot of potential in my 20s. For this particular case, i´m GLAD of what i did. Much better than never asking and wondering what it could have been. At least got some bravery out of it for once and a wonderful afternoon in July.

Has anyone else?,"Greetings all I wanted to tell my story. I don't expect you to believe me but that is ok. This is real. It happened and I don't know what is going on with this.

\*Names, locations, and details edited for privacy reasons.\*

For context I'm in a recovery program. I've been sober for nearly a decade and started young in the rooms of recovery. During my time the 12 steps changed my life and gave me my life back. I've been blessed to meet some amazing people. I've met police officers, lawyers, retired Navy Seals, doctors, mothers, homeless people with crazy stories, the ordained, and everything in between. Addiction is an equalizer and bonds folks together that wouldn't normally meet so that they can share their experiences and recover from their addiction. This story isn't based on the recovery program. It is the setting.

The homeless population is a group I've gotten familiar with during my time in recovery. ""There but for the grace of God goes I"" was a common phrase I've heard regarding these people and I would often try to help them. This help would range from giving them a cigarette and listening to their stories to on occasion buying them dinner and sharing a meal as they talk and share their experiences. Some of these hardened and intelligent yet folks that endure unfortunate circumstances has been something that has profoundly shaped my perspective of people and given me a sense of respect for the world. People matter and have value and worth regardless of where they are in the world.

But....

Some lucid or in the throws of some episode would tell darker stories. Sometimes it was childhood trauma, abuse of all kinds, crimes that they were victims or perpetrators of. Some were not kind and were not above violent tendencies and emotional outbursts. It was tragic to see that some could lead fulfilling and bountiful lives if given proper treatment. One individual stood out... A man named Gary. Gary was older and had the stereotypical grizzled leather-skinned look of a man burdened with a hard life. He was rarely lucid and would ramble, mutter and laugh to himself. The strange thing is that in moments of lucidity he would reference he was a pilot in the Air Force and would recount missions, experiences and sometimes something darker. He claimed he found ""something he wasn't supposed to"" and that ""the government experimented on him by putting something in his head"". I would politely listen while sharing a smoke and give him the time of day. Behind those distant glassy eyes, I could see that he genuinely believed what he said. There was fear there. Deep seated horror that struck me as I would pay attention. He would often stumble around muttering and rubbing his head.

People don't pay attention to folks like him. He lives on the margin of society. Over the years he would disappear and then pop back up. Sometimes he would be ""better"" and other times he would be worse. My fellows in recovery thought he would wander during the seasons for work. Maybe he would migrate to warmer climate before the snow came. Maybe he got arrested or got himself into an institution. He always said ""the government took him away for more testing"".

Nobody believes the ""crazy homeless chain smoker"". Nobody would pay attention. He never asked for help and even if he did it would be cigarettes or food or money. Some times he would burst out laughing for no reason loud and cracked like rumpled paper... Then it would cut off suddenly like it was switched off. One night over a year ago... Gary was seen one last time. I was outside of a church where our recovery group meets and he was there but seemed... Drugged... Like he was ""on his meds but not ok"". He seemed dejected, lucid, and sad. I spoke to him for a bit and he said in a defeated childlike state ""this is my last meeting. I don't think the bad men are gonna let me back out. I think they are gonna put more stuff in my head."" I listened politely and sat talking with him as we sipped burned coffee and ate the sugar cookies that are at most grandparent's house. The moment felt final. I didn't understand why.

Then like a ghost or a mirage he disappeared.

At first everyone thought Gary just moved on. Maybe he got help? Maybe he got arrested a final time? Maybe a shelter took him in and he got on his feet? The thing is I looked after 7 months. I checked hospitals, prisons, shelters, and other places that he would frequent. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. By pulling some strings in my line of work I was able to confirm something insane. Gary WAS in fact a pilot in the Air Force. That was real...

What if he was telling the truth?

What if he had found something he wasn't supposed to, and the result was something sinister?

I needed to sneeze, and while I did, I felt a quite strong pain and felt a “pop”. I instantly thought, “ok I just broke my rib while sneezing”, as I knew it could happen. The pain wore off eventually, but came back after some months when I got an impact to ribcage while I was playing football (soccer). Got better – then again a hit and lasting pain after getting an impact. Went to see doctor, no visible broken bones, and also nothing else to worry about on x-ray. Maybe a “bone bruise/contusion” said doctor. Ok! Got better. Then again playing football I got hit – same thing, different part of chest. I started to worry about having some “condition” or then just very weak bones. Then it got well again as I could expect. Now again two weeks ago I had a quite mild impact from opponents elbow on chest again while playing football. Despite of the lightness of the impact I knew right after it that the symptoms would appear again. And they did. And I know they will also go away in few weeks.

The pain always has been around costal cartilage area, if I remember right, on ribs varying from 2 to maybe 6. It has always been localized, a spot like source of pain, not the whole chest. I have experienced pain on both sides of body on different occasions. Usually at least some amount of swelling of the bone/cartilage is present.

My question is: Is this costochondritis, or are my ribs just super weak? I haven’t heard of football players that have this kind of pain after almost every moderate or even lighter hit to chest area, as those kind of hits are quite normal in football. I’m skinny, though, so I could also just believe that my ribcage is vulnerable but I’d like to tend to think I still have normal bone structure despite of my skinny body… Though I understand that the muscles around ribs contribute to preventing fractures. Also It could be just bad luck – exceptionally specific, more than normal level pain inducing impacts every time for me.

Reading about costochondritis has taught me that I am a prone to develop it since I’ve been a big nerd in my youth and also work using computer.

tl;dr: Prolonged localized pain on different parts of ribcage on multiple occasions after getting an impact to chest on soccer matches during around three years span. Weak bones/muscles or just super bad luck or costochondritis? Is costochondritis something that could flare up occasionally from even mildish impacts but otherwise not present itself?

1nabvvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nabvvw/bean_freezing_plan/,Bean freezing plan,"Hi all,
I've decided this is the year where I experience and enjoy pour over coffee as close to it's full potential as is economically viable for me.  I'ven purchased a Pietro and an A4z, a Timemore Fish and a Pulsar within the last few months and am very happy with the results they all produce. I've also honed in on Ashbeck bottled water as being my water of choice (having also tried DIY lotus and diluted TWW). Which just leaves the critical ingredient of the bean. Up until now I've bought at the budget end of the freshly roasted beans spectrum but I now want to up the bean game. To that end I've secured the following beans and by freezing them would like to enjoy each of them over the next few months, interspersed with some lesser beans.  

TANAT - Nestor Lasso \[Sidra\] × 1 September - Wilder Lasso, Anaerobic
TANAT - Finca La Riviera \[Pink Bourbon
TANAT - Kenya, Inoi Ndimi AA \[Washed\] 
September - Wilder Lasso, Anaerobic
Hydrangea - Gesha - Luna Bermudez, Finca El Paraiso
Hydrangea - Semi Washed Gesha - Ermes Lasso 
Assembly - Colombia — Nestor Lasso Ombligon 2024
DAK - Milky Cake | Colombia

My plan was to cup each of them at the 2 week mark and subject to the flavour being complex enough and not exhibiting any vegetal notes freezing it in a ziplock bagged 50ml centrifuge tube. Then I can pull individual portions out as and when I need them. I guess I could also experiment with leaving the individual portions to rest longer without the risk of compromising the whole bag.
Before I go ahead and begin the freezing process, I wanted to check whether this sounds a sensible plan? 

One concern I have is that I may be freezing the beans too early and somehow jeopardising my ability to sample the beans at their best (?). I've tried to mitigate this with the cupping, but being far from a Q-grader and never having tried the beans before I can imagine me prematurely freezing a bean that has more to give. And if this does happen, is it ok for me to rest unfrozen beans (unfreezing them whilst still sealed) or will the beans deteriorate quicker after being frozen? 

Also, is my generalised freezing time workable or do the ideal rest times vary wildly across the beans? perhaps some of the listed beans jump out as definitely needing more rest?

I'd be very grateful for any guidance/input from the great minds of this sub. Including factors I haven't yet considered. :-)

Ps. Apologies if I appear impatient and gluttonous. There are personal reasons behind all this- in addition to me being well and truly lost down the rabbit hole :-)

Does this mean devil's aren't born out of fear but rather, devil's are born every once in a while and they MIGHT randomly be named after something very scary. This would explain why tomato devil is a thing but we haven't seen a devil for more explicit things. This could also mean some very powerful devil's could just not exist even if they're from a very scary concept. ",1,1757195240.0,Chainsawfolk,2,1.0,False

Mount Paozu is a beautiful mountain on the outskirts of civilization. It is home to many megafauna and beautiful flowers. On this night however, this mountain would be anything but beautiful. The full moon illuminated the summit of the mountain. A very simple hut could be seen with 2 beds inside one made for an adult and one made for a child. In the house we see two people, an old man with a green hat, a jacket with yellow ring patterns and a white zipper, and wearing a black shirt underneath. The man also had a big grey mustache showing his age. He had quite a lot of wrinkles  and seemed to be pushing 90. The grandpa is accompanied by a little boy.  

This lil boy is a 6 year old kid named Kakarot, but the name his grandpa gave him is Goku. Goku is very small wearing a blue gi with white rope strung around it and seems to have a brown tail. He is right now seen eating a bowl of rice happily, using his bare hands to gobble down the little grains of rice. Goku just smiles as he does so just as happy as can be. The boy then says,”Thank you Grandpa, this rice is so delicious.” 

Gohan just chuckles and simply says,”Oh you’re very welcome my boy. Now we’re going to rest for the night because tomorrow It’ll be our most intense training session yet.” Goku glances back with excitement, his tail perking up as he responds by putting his fist up in a fist pump, “I’m so excited. I can’t wait to train more with you.” Goku just happily chuckles before slowly getting ready for bed. Goku only has 1 other piece of clothing, a set of pajamas seemingly made to be slept in. Goku’s clothing is a simple set of a pajama shirt and pajama pants. 

Goku then cutely gives his grandpa a hug before saying,”Goodnight grandpa. I love you.” Gohan happily hugs him back and pats Goku on the head saying, “Goodnight Goku.” 

With that Goku tries to go to sleep as Gohan happily dozes off.  Goku is seen trying to go to bed but no matter what he can’t. Goku for a bit can’t put his finger on it until…he feels himself needing to relieve himself. Goku out of naivety and knowing what time of the month goes outside. Goku then hums to himself and finds a bush before pulling his pants and peeing on the ground. Goku hums as he pees, hoping to just pee and be back. However, as he pees he is then met with something, he hears the sound of a laser rifle and goku, not knowing what it is exactly but knowing a bit dodges. 

The laser rifle comes from a mysterious man who seems to be small and has blue skin with yellow eyes that are in the shape of candy corn. The man is wearing a white suit with a mysterious symbol. The man then simply states, “Galactic Patrol Jaco. You are the saiyan Kakarot, correct?” Goku then nods but then asks, “H-how do you know my name?” Jaco then says, “I am the one responsible for this quadrant and I have come to make sure you’re neutralized. You are a saiyan and a threat to earth?” 

Goku then innocently asks,”A- a Threat?” Jaco nods before pointing his blaster at goku, “Yes, the saiyans have caused widespread havoc and destruction across the cosmos and right now. You can either come quietly or I can make sure you’re never a threat.” Goku, who looks a bit irritated and enraged by Jaco then gets into a fighting stance. Goku was so nice and kind with Grandpa Gohan. Why was this man thinking he was a threat? Goku’s mind was confused but then goku states, “No I’m never leaving my grandpa!” Jaco then guffaws and says,”Grandpa? Kakarot, do you remember your parents.” Kakarot then nods before smacking Jaco with a great punch which surprises Jaco. 	Track 2:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3\_hFpr3FvuI&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=7	](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hFpr3FvuI&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=7)With this Jaco duels with Kakarot. The little boy is getting in close and while he isn’t as strong as any of the saiyans Jaco has seen, Kakarot is still quite formidable. However, Jaco feels a bit odd. Kakarot doesn’t seem bloodthirsty.  Kakarot is fighting pretty defensively all things considered. He is purposely using punches smacks and finger pokes made to just injure and not even gravely injure or do any permanent damage. The way he dodges seems also way to graceful compared to other saiyans. He dodges with skill rather than just raw power. Jaco then pulls up a scouter to see his battle power since the galactic patrol has scouters too. 

Goku’s Power Level apparently reads 25. Jaco reads this and it’s almost baffling. It should be way higher considering how he’s fighting. If he didn’t see the scouter’s reading, he’d think goku’s power level was 300. Goku simply asks, “Please, I don’t want to fight. I just want to go to bed. Can you please just stop?” 

Jaco then shoots a hole through goku’s shoulder saying, “No way saiyan scum! I cannot allow you to live on this planet. Resisting arrest means you’ve signed your death warrant saiyan.” Then slams goku to the ground and prepares to fire a laser blast through the kid’s head. Goku thinks its all over and looks up at Jaco but in doing so, he looks up at the moon. 

Grandpa Gohan is seen waking up in a cold sweat sensing this. Gohan then panics, “No it can’t be!” Gohan then rushes outside to see goku turning into an Oozaru. Gohan had been fearing this and then saw something, that random guy beside him. Gohan knows goku wouldn’t intentionally look at the moon. Especially knowing how it could mean going great ape. So something must’ve forced him. Gohan rushes over and tackles jaco with Jaco winded. How was this earthling stronger than him by so much?! Jaco even gasps for air asking, “What are you doing citizen?! You are not to interfere with a patrolman’s duty.” 

Gohan however was having none of this. Knowing goku can’t control this form he shouts, “What have you done with my grandson?!” Jaco simply says, “That is not your grandson, that is a saiyan.” 

Gohan then smacks Jaco saying, “I raised him since he was 2, he looks up to me, he cares about me. We spar together, train together. He is my grandson. He is my responsibility. So let me ask again.” Gohan then slams Jaco to the ground; “WHAT DID YOU TO HIM?!” 

Jaco coughs up blood astounded by how protective this random earthling is to Goku. Jaco then responds, “I was here to arrest him and was going to kill him when he fought me.” Gohan’s eyes widened and looked almost rageful. Gohan usually had a calm head but this was different. Goku was just minding his business and Gohan saw what goku was doing. Goku was simply out here to potty. Gohan then says with a calm rage, “Leave this planet immediately. I don’t want you to ever hurt my grandson again.” 

Jaco wanted to protest but, he didn’t want to die. Not like this, not to some earthling he couldn’t account for. Jaco with that retreats to a spaceship. 

[Track 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmp2R4ZDNHk)

Gohan then look over and saw it. Goku was now fully transformed into a great ape. His eyes looked feral and he just started stomping and rampaging without thought or anything. It was like Goku wasn’t even there anymore and the feral malice of the war-like saiyans were in control. Goku screamed and screeched, banging his chest as he started tearing down trees. Gohan without hesitation rushes downwards to face goku. He knows he could die but if Goku is left unchecked he could destroy the forest or even worst kill so many people. Gohan couldn’t allow that. 

Gohan rushes down and gets into a fighting stance. He knows from before he can’t face this beast headon but he might be able to cut off Goku’s tail. He then rushes over and takes a deep breath. Gohan then says, “My Grandson, I’m sorry for what I must do.” Gohan then stretches his hands out when he gets near Goku and shouts,”THUNDER SHOCK SUPRISE!” 

Gohan then shoots out static electricity from his hands which paralyzes Goku in place. He can’t move  but he then stares at Gohan. Goku’s mouth charges a beam and goku is being weakened out of being a great ape just by this. Gohan might not need to cut off his tail after all. However before goku fully detransforms a beam is fired which blasts a hole through gohan’s chest as Gohan screams in pain. Goku fully transformed and now is weakened but still okay. However, seeing gohan he realizes what happened and knows what he did. 

[Track 4:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWXtdYwLFSA)

Tears fall from goku’s eyes as he cries, “Grandpa! No, please! Don’t die. Please don’t go.” Grandpa then says, “Goku, I’m glad to have met you.” 

Goku then cries and punches himself and cries, “It’s all my fault, if I wasn’t a stupid saiyan. If I was a good-” 

Grandpa then slowly hugs goku and gives a smile saying, “Kakarot, listen me to my grandson, my beautiful boy. Those tears show your kindness. Other saiyans wouldn’t feel remorse. They’d just turn the other way and move on. That kind heart you have, it’s always present.” Goku then cries before whimpering, “I’m so sorry grandpa.” Grandpa then whispers, “It’s okay, I forgive you. I just want you to remember, to keep training, keep growing in mind and strength. And for my sake, for everyone’s, never lose that caring heart.” With that grandpa gohan passes on and goku’s tears fall even more. Goku knew Grandpa Gohan isn’t his actual grandpa but his kindness was so heartfelt.  Goku had learned so much and felt so moved by his Grandpa. 

With that happening, Kakarot goes to a secluded area of the forest. His tears never stop falling as he walks. The guilt is overwhelming, the guilt of killing his grandpa but he presses on for his grandpa. With his own two hands he builds out of wood a casket to put his grandpa in. 

A casket with the symbol of one of his gi though he doesn’t know what the gi symbol his. He also uses his own fist to slowly and methodically carve away a stone. It takes several days for the stone but he eventually makes it into a tombstone. The tombstone then reads, “To Grandpa Gohan, a wonderful strange man who had a great mind, great heart, and great strength who made me the kind person I am now.” Goku then looks at the finished gravesite. With the clasp of his two hands he makes a vow. A vow to himself and his grandpa. “I swear to you Grandfather, I will keep training and surpass my limits every day, to become stronger than before, to make new friends, and to protect this world you called home. I promise you, compassion.” 

OP Variant 1:[ Makafushigi Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROnd7d4axHo) (Though as this is the first chapter this isn’t going to be the standard intro and instead a montage of various characters we’ll see. The intro would be footage of goku doing some training over the course of 4 years, Bulma scolding Jaco and finding out about the dragon balls from Tights and finding she has 1 in her basement. We also see Oolong doing his kidnapping of the 3 girls and being shocked at how much they push him around. Yamcha is in the shadows doing his usual bandit stuff with Puar oddly fighting alongside Yamcha. It also shows chi-chi ruling fire mountain with her father before eventually getting bored and wanting to find something other than diplomacy to do and deciding to find a friend. 

It also shows what happens with King Gurumes starting out as just a simple asshole with good rules to a straight up villain when he finds 1 ruby and wants more and the power and his own ambitions corrupting him showing how he corrupts himself. We see Pansy’s father being killed by Bongo and Pansy going on a journey to find people to help her fight while also training. We also see a mysterious woman showing 1 of the dragon balls to Gurumes with a stoic face while showing she can shapeshift before being fitted with some military outfit. All of this being within the 4 years between the death of grandpa gohan and when Bulma sets out for mount Paozu when she turns 16.)

The montage has finally ended and we see Kakarot doing some prayer to kami before clapping his hands together. Kakarot comedically polishes the dragon ball with a towel and feather before seeing it sparkle greatly. Kakarot looks about the same as he did those 4 years ago and seems to be the same naive happy go lucky saiyan with the great heart. Kakarot just chuckles before declaring, “After I find an apple and a fish to eat, I’m going to start doing some intense training. Crystal Ball, I’ll see you again soon.” Kakarot is seen hopping around the forest. The sunlight is shining brightly, the pterodactyls are flying and so are the birds and bees. The tigers, panthers, wolves and other wildlife scurry around finding food and the winds blow calmly over the greenery. The sky is blue and sunny and the clouds leisurely stroll by in the sky. The waterfall rush down with excitement as the waters rapidly swim by.

[Track 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzNeFUMQZ5E&list=PL9A888F268625E56E&index=5)  

He then finds a tree and happily eats an apple from it. The apple seems very tasty and he eats it with glee. The soft juicy flavor of it plus the crunchy texture of the skin makes his eyes widen with glee. Kakarot takes a moment while sitting on the tree to gaze at the sun. The sun feels so warm and so comforting compared to the moon. The sun smiles down at goku and goku just simply chuckles. \*It’s great to be here.\*   
  
As Goku finishes his meal of an apple he exclaims, “That was go delicious. Thank you tree!” Goku gives the tree a hug before throwing his clothes onto land near a ravine. He then dives happily into the ravine, a big splash being made from Goku diving from so high and displacing a lot of water. Water splashes all around even creating a bit of a rainbow. In the water, giant fish and sealife could be seen, with the biggest fish being an biggest one. Goku then grabs it and says, “Alright, you’re coming with me.” Goku then punches the fish and yanks it out of the water which knocks it unconscious. Goku with that dries himself off with  some leaves before putting back on his clothes.   
  
  
  
Meanwhile, Goku is simply stretching and before saying, “Alright, when I get back home you’re going to last quite a while. I bet you’ll last a couple days.” Goku just chuckles before softly and gently patting the fish. Before he leaves though he  reaches down into his pocket and throws the apple core. 

It’s not much but goku throws it in as a gift for the other sealife. Goku is seen humming to himself as he throws the fish over his back, strutting back up the mountain with a gleeful smile. As this is happening, a teenage girl is seen checking a radar while driving around the mountain. The girl is dressed in a pink dress with the name bulma written on it, a red ribbon bow on her blue hair, a purple scarf and purple socks that go with her blue sneakers. The teenage girl simply takes out a device that looks like a stopwatch but has a green grid interface with 2 yellow dots showing. The girl then smiles before muttering happily to herself, “Good. So I’m going in the right direction.”

The teenage girl then gets into her car before turning the key to it and drives up the mountain. The teenage  girl was focused and she remembers back a bit. The girl pondered, “Jaco warned me about some sort of monkey kid in the forest. Jaco called it a saiyan, but Jaco’s always been weird. I don’t know if I should trust him or not on this. Eh, I’ll figure that out when it comes a lot.” The girl had become so lost in thought but then soon realized a little boy was in front of her. The teen started to scream and Goku tried to run away but then got hit by the truck and slammed into a rock. 

The teen looked around thinking,”Huh, did I kill him? I really hope I didn’t. My dad would ground me for life if I-” Thankfully goku is seen dusting himself off. Goku then looks angry. The teenage girl asks, “Wait, you’re still alive?!” Goku grunts and says, “Yes I’m still alive, and if you wanted some fish you could’ve asked me nicely.” Goku then goes to lift the car with the teenage girl screaming, “What are you doing?!” Goku then throws the car far away with the teenage girl looking shocked as Goku does it.  Goku then pulls out the power pole before saying, “Now that should teach you a lesson monster.” 

Goku then felt something plink off his head. It hurt a bit but he just turned around. She is seen poked out the car with a gun drawn. Goku then realizes, he might’ve hurt someone. “Wait, are you a human?”  The teenage girl asking, “Wait, did you not know?” Goku looks a bit horrorstruck as he tries to hit himself with the powerpole but realizing goku isn’t a threat, and they just got up on the wrong foot, Teenage girl grabs goku trying her best to restrain goku but goku looking confused. The teenage girl then asks, “What are you doing hurting yourself you idoit?” Goku then answers, “I promised my grandpa to protect this place and if you’re a human and I hurt you I broke that promise.” 

[Track 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vODHNCYC3e8&list=PLksHfEhfGHr394kCptbS-0NZC59dsKFVN&index=12)

Bulma then sees the saiyan tail goku has. At first, Bulma is conflicted but still she says, “Woah woah woah. I’m fine.” Bulma puts her hands up and goku looks around to check. Goku takes a deep breath and puts the powerpole back before apologizing, “I’m sorry I threw you.” The teenage girl then reassures him, “No it’s fine. I should’ve paid more attention. I’m surprised at how you could lift that car.” Goku then asks, “What’s a car?” The girl then points to the damaged vehicle. Goku then says, “That’s a car, i thought it was a monster.” 

The teenage girl looks agitated before taking a deep breath. This whole encounter was a bit odd for her. She decides to walk with goku. She then asks, “So kid, what’s your name?” Goku then asks, “Which one?” She then asks a bit shocked, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHICH ONE!?” Goku then says, “The one my mom gave me or the one my grandpa gave me.” The girl then responds, “The one you go by the most often!” Goku then says, “Oh my name’s son Goku then.” The girl then takes a deep breath before saying, “Well my name is Bulma.” Goku starts laughing a bit. Bulma then asks, “What’s so funny?” Goku answers while giggling as he strolls, “Well it’s such a weird name.” Bulma pouts before crossing her arms saying, “It’s not that weird.” 

Goku then asks as he walks, “So Bulma, what were you coming here for?” Bulma then gives a smirk back at goku before saying, “Well, I’m looking to find 7 crystal balls called Dragon Ball. It’s said if you find all 7 and say a certain set of words you can make the eternal dragon shenron appear, and he’ll grant you any wish.” Goku then looks very intrigued and asks, “Any wish?” 

Bulma then nods saying, “Yep! Any single wish.” Goku then asks, “So what are you going to wish for?” Bulma then answers, “I wanna wish for the perfect boyfriend.” Goku tilts his head asking, “What’s a boyfriend?” Bulma almost falls down hearing this. Bulma then asks, “You don’t know what a boyfriend is either?!”  Goku shakes his head saying, “Nope.” Bulma facepalms before thinking in her head, “*This kid is so clueless. I’m going to have to see what he does and doesn’t know.”*   Goku then adorably asks, “So Bulma what does this dragon ball look like?” 

Bulma then grabs one and says, “Oh I can show you because I have one.” Bulma pulls out a dragon ball and it is some orange crystalline ball with two red starts inside it. Goku looks astounded before exclaiming, “Oh I have 1 I have 1!” Bulma then asks, “You do?” Goku then rushes off jumping from tree to tree while holding his fish. Goku is seen rushing ahead and Bulma realizing she’s being left behind rushes behind goku comically running and screams, “KID WAIT UP!” 

Bulma and Goku are seen running but soon goku stops because his stomach starts grumbling. It’s been a bit of time but he’s already kinda hungry. Goku looks at the raw fish and says, “Welp I was going to wait but-” Bulma then sees goku about to eat into the raw fish and despite being okay with eating some wildlife, Bulma then asks, “What the hell are you doing?” Goku then asks, “About ot eat it why?” Bulma then says, “You’re not going to cook it or anything?” Goku then asks, “How do you cook?” Bulma’s eyes widen alot. Bulma then asks, “Do you know how to cook?” Goku then responds, “No I usually just grow plants and eat whatever food I want that day. I thought you just kill the fish and eat it.”  

Bulma smirks and says, “Goku, I want to have the dragon ball when we get to where you have it.” Goku then holds his pole defensively screaming, “No way I’m just going to give it to you!” Bulma then says, “Oh I have an offer you can’t refuse.” Bulma then flashes herself for a bit thinking this might entice him but she does have a backup plan. Goku however looks and asks, “Why do I want your butt?” Bulma then sighs realizing she can’t just seduce Goku. Bulma then simply says, “Then how about this, I’ll make this fish taste better than anything you’ve ever tasted!” Goku eyes widen in surprise and intrigue but then he simply responds, “What? There’s no way you can do that.” Bulma chuckles smugly making a face that mixes cute and prideful as she declares, “I’m Bulma, the cutest and smartest scientist ever. Of course I’ll be able to!”

With that bulma gathered firewood. It was a huge slog because Bulma isn’t used to doing such manual labor. However, Bulma also was determined. She wouldn’t stop until she got all 7 dragon balls. She wanted the perfect lover and she started daydreaming about the perfect lover. Goku meanwhile sat down while drawing in the dirt, trying to occupy his time. Goku’s attention span when not in combat wasn’t the greatest.  Goku hums to himself and his tail waggles a bit.   
  
 Bulma expects to simply hate this, doing this manual work and having to collect wood just to satisfy this little boy and get the dragon ball but oddly, she starts getting into it. Bulma finds random logs and pieces of wood and feels herself growing slightly stronger as she does this simple thing. It’s odd. For someone from the city like her, it felt both exhausting yet also invorgiating. Her goal motivated her but something slight to this, something intrinsic in the back of her head kept feeling pumped. Bulma eventually brings all the wood to the area near where goku and the fish is. 

Bulma then rumages into her bag and grabs a lighter and some seasonings. Bulma usually uses salt and stuff sparingly but she did promise goku to make the best tasting fish. Bulma isn’t the biggest culinary expert but she does know her stuff when it comes to it and does know how things cook being a very well read woman. 

When Bulma returns Goku then asks, “How long is it going to take?” Bulma then says, “Wait a bit, it’s going to take 1 hour at the latest to finish this fish.” Goku reaches near the flame before feeling a sharp pain goku then screams,”YEOWCH!” Goku blows his hand and asks, “What is this magic?” Bulma sighs saying, “It’s not magic, it’s fire. How much do you know?” Goku then says, “I know how to read, I can write a bit, and I can count up to 10.” Bulma then asks, “So you don’t know much.” Goku nods a bit embarrassed. Bulma then groans to herself realizing how arduous it’ll be. 

A woman in an air force outfit is seen walking by with a big man in the some outfit walking by too. The woman simply says, “Ah well that was easy. I thought this place would be more guarded.” The big man chuckles saying, “Once king Gurumes gets all the dragon balls we’ll be living in luxury.” Close up the woman’s eyes are seen which seem to be completely black. The woman chuckles and remarks, “That is, if he still is alive.”  

After 1 hour, Bulma is seen finishing the fish and goku’s eyes are locked right onto it. Goku was hoping to see what Bulma was feeling. Bulma then sighs before saying, “The fish is done.” Goku then manages to chop the fish into little pieces. With that goku tries to taste the fish. He was hopeful and he was even more excited. His eyes glistened and he almost shed tears. Goku’s tail started wagging like an excited puppy. Goku then exclaims, “It’s so delicious!” Goku then in an instant hugs bulma. Bulma pushes goku back saying, “Get off of me kid!” Bulma then groans before checking her radar. Bulma decides to put the rest of the fish in a capsule and when goku sees this his eyes look surprise. Goku then exclaims, “You must be a magician!” Bulma then chuckles a bit before saying, “No, I’m not. This is just a device I use to shrink into small lil pellets for storage and use later. It’s a system my mother and father designed and I improved upon.” Goku’s eyes are in wonder. Bulma then sighs before snarkily saying, “If you’re done gawking, I’ve got some bad news for you.” Goku then asks, “Huh what is it?” Bulma then says, “If my radar is correct, your dragon ball isn’t there anymore.” Goku then rushes off and Bulma screams, “Don’t just leave me behind!”   
  
  
  
After a bit of time they get to the hut and Goku sees instead of a dragon ball there’s a coin. Goku looking utterly angered smacks the grown throwing a temper tantrum. “No. NO! NO! NO!” Bulma felt the ground shake a bit as goku pounded the ground. Goku teared up a bit but before Goku could do anything rash Bulma gave a giggle. Goku wipes his face asking, “What’s so funny.” Bulma then says, “We’re going after them, goku!” Goku then says, “But where did they go?” Bulma then points to the sky and it seems like a bird. Goku then asks, “Is that a bird?” Bulma then responds, “No you dummy it’s a plane. And we’re going to follow it.” Goku then tilts his head in confusion. “How?” Bulma then throws a capsule outside with the number on it being labeled 5. Goku then sees a giant contraption with engines and hears the bubbling of water. Goku then screams, “ANOTHER MONSTER?!” Bulma then screams, “For KAMI’S SAKE! This isn’t a monster, this is a water-powered jet jet. They're everywhere.” Bulma then goes and grabs goku carrying goku into the hydrojet saying, “We’re going to follow that plane!” 

The two then rocket off into the sky and on a bit of the other side is the woman from before and the man. The woman is seen locking the box where the dragon ball is. The woman says, “Alright so you know where we’re headed to next?” The man then nods saying, “Yep, I know exactly where. We’re headed to one of the various villages near east city, why do you ask Pasta?” Pasta takes off her helmet for a bit before saying, “Bongo, I’m sick and tired of working under Gurumes. He’s always so vague and always makes us do random shit. We’ve been loyal to him for 15 years and nothing has gotten better.”  

Bongo then sighs and replies, “Yeah but with this he may look at us with favor.” Pasta rolls her eyes but then checks the radar. “What the?” Pasta then looks to the side and sees a teenage girl and a little boy. “Give us back the dragon ball!” “I’ll give you back your coin too!” Pasta then smirks before saying back to the two, “Oh you wanna make demands to me, keep following and I’ll make sure you’re shot out the sky.” Bulma says, “No way in hell!” Pasta then says, “Bongo, you steer, and I’ll fire and charge the bazooka.” Bongo then says, “Got it!” 

[Track 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwuqlC32EHs&list=PLksHfEhfGHr394kCptbS-0NZC59dsKFVN&index=16)

Bullets then rain from down there and Goku and Bulma feel the brunt of it. Bulma evasively steers the jet and Goku says, “They don’t seem to wanna give it back.” Bulma then says, “I guess we have to fight then!” Bulma then starts firing bullets from her own water jet. Bullets keep flying across the blue sky. The two pass through clouds and soar around. We see sights of pterodactyls and one such one tries to grab onto the hydrojet but gets shot away. 

Bongo is looking quite nervous and whispers, “Pasta, we’re going to be shot down ourselves if we take any more damage and they have faster bullets so we can’t dodge or outgun them.” Pasta then says, “Then it’s a good thing I have the bazooka ready.” Pasta aims a bit with the scope of the bazooka targeting closely while standing atop it. With a bit of skill she fires the giant explosive round.  Bulma at first is confident and even dodges with the plane. Bulma then taunts, “Hah you missed!” However, the round seems to curve and hits Bulma’s plane from behind. 

Pasta grabs a rose and chuckles before sniffing it. “Ahh the scent of victory. There’s no way they survived that explosion.” The plane indeed explodes but goku grabbed bulma and secretly jumped out. Bulma then asks,”GOKU?! Are you crazy?!” Goku then asks, “Did you wanna be blown up?” Bulma then says, “There’s no way I’m surviving a fall from this height.” Goku then says confidently,”Don’t worry we will.” 

Goku then expertly grabs the powerpole and wedges it into the edge. Bulma and Goku then slide down the cliff edge before getting near the edge.  Goku then asks, “You okay bulma?” Bulma then nods but realizes she’s urinating and shouts, “Yeah, I pissed myself though.” Goku then chuckles a bit and Bulma despite the adrenaline chuckles too. Goku then with expert grace and precision launches himself off the wall before saying, “There, but how are we going to find them.” Bulma then shrugs saying, “Oh we’ll find them eventually. I think we should just find the other dragon balls first though.” 

Goku nods saying, “Sounds like a plan.” Bulma then asks, “I do wanna ask why you were so confident? We literally could’ve went splat against the water.” Goku then simply says, “Oh I knew by digging my powerpole into the edge I could slow down the descent of us enough to survive. I do it sometimes when I’m training.” Bulma’s eyes widen, Goku might be as dumb as he thinks. Bulma then uses a different capsule and creates a car. With that the two are off. Bulma rides with goku across the forest and far away. 

Nothing of note happens for the rest of the day as they simply just ride on. Though when its nighttime goku seems a bit panicked. Goku’s tail twitches in fear. Bulma groans angrily as she hears this. Goku’s been such a wildcard and though charming is an irritant at this point. Bulma then asks, “What is it?” Goku then whispers, “I need to be inside.” Bulma then asks, “Why?” Goku then responds, “Trust ME! I do!” Bulma decides for once not to question it and pulls over at a clearing. Bulma then uses one of her capsules to pop out a small house. Bulma then sassily says, “Here we go, now you don’t have to be a big baby.” Goku looks pissed off but then lets it go. Bulma tilts an eyebrow seeing this. When they get inside Bulma can see how bad goku smells. Bulma never noticed before because other scents blended it away but now it’s clear. Bulma then asks, “Goku you smell terrible. Have you ever taken a bath?!” Goku then asks, “What’s a bath?!” Bulma then asks a question in the back of her mind. “Goku how old are you?” Goku then counts on his fingers and says, “10.” Bulma blushes a bit realizing she not only tried to seduce a 10 year old but literally showed goku her panties. Bulma also realizing because of his age and his clear lack of knowledge about certain stuff, Bulma tells Goku, “Alright then, I’m going to bathe you and tell you all about girls okay.” 

Goku tilts her head a bit. Goku then gets naked and so does Bulma. Goku looks at Bulma at shock saying, “You don’t have balls?” Bulma then says, “Goku, women don’t have balls. This is our private part kay. It’s called a vagina.” Goku then asks, “Why does it look different.” Bulma then says, “It’s because it’s made for birthing stuff. It’s where pee and stuff come out too.” Goku then reaches over but Bulma smacks goku’s hand scolding, “Goku no.”  Goku tilts his head asking, “What why?” Bulma then explain, “This is my private part. You aren’t allowed to touch it without permission.” Goku then asks, “Is it the same for my balls?” Bulma nods and asks, “So then goku, can I bathe you. You’ll feel so much better.” Goku nods. So Bulma takes a bubble bath and helps goku take a bubble bath. Bulma is both irritated but relieved. Bulma realizes how bad things could’ve went if she didn’t explain this fast because Goku from what she can tell just tends to do stuff and doesn’t know alot. As She washes goku’s back Bulma asks, “So Goku, do you know who your parents are?” Goku then sighs before saying, “Yeah,but they’re long dead now. I remember a lot about them but they told me one thing before they died. They told me to survive.” Bulma’s eyes widen as she asks, “Goku, what is your other name?” Goku then sighs before responding, “My other name, my saiyan name, it’s kakarot or Kakarotto depending on who says it. It’s the name my mother and father gave me.”   
  
  
  
Bulma then sighs before thinking, “This guy really is a saiyan, but he’s not like any saiyan I’ve heard of. And Jaco did seem to be reckless. Maybe I don’t need to be as cautious.” Bulma then says, “Well then goku, I’m going to find you a great home to stay in once we’re done with this journey.” Goku then asks, “Will I be able to train and push my limits like before.” Bulma nods and happily responds, “Every single day.”   
  
  
  
 With that Bulma dries off goku with a towel and Bulma herself dries off. Goku is then given some panties, some pajama pants, and a normal t-shirt. Bulma doesn’t have underwear so this will have to do for now. Bulma just wears a pink night gown with panties underneath. Bulma is just seen using a hairdryer while alone in thought. A Bunch of thoughts of annoyance but also a slight but not huge amount of empathy. She was just going to use him to help her get the dragon balls but maybe, she can have more of a relationship than just that. Maybe she can be goku’s friend. Goku is seen running around before trying some of the coffee. Goku then spits it out asking, “Why is this soup bitter?” Bulma then says, “It’s coffee you dummy, It’s not the sweetest drink ever. It’s just meant to kickup your energy and make you overstimulated.” Goku then asks, “Why drink something just for the effect?” Bulma then responds, “If the result is good enough you’ll be willing to be disappointed.”   
  
Bulma is styling her hair as Goku runs around the house. Bulma however then says, “Goku, please stop running around.” Goku then exclaims, “But I wanna train!” Bulma then sighs pressing her temples to her forehead. “Goku, just…listen. I’d be fine with it to an extent if you just were training. BUT WE’RE IN A SMALL HOUSE! There’s no room for training.” Goku then says, “I promised my grandpa I’d train every day.” Bulma sighs before saying, “Let me think of something.” Bulma looks in the the drawers trying to find something to use to try and at least prevent goku from being bored and causing her more of a nuisance. She does find some heavy tungsten bricks she was using and then she finds a wielding mask. Bulma then sculpts them into dumbbells and tells goku, “Alright, try lifting these.” 

These bricks were quite heavy and way heavier than cars. Goku looked ready to train his lifting but then decided to put it in his clothing. Maybe that’ll be good training and sure enough. They weighed him down a lot. Bulma soon finished herself and finished brushing her own teeth before telling goku. “Alright, we’re going to have dinner now.” Bulma then unloads the capsule with the fish. Bulma and Goku then eat the fish happily. Goku seems excited to eat it.

Bulma looks on goku’s fix with a bit of amusement. For all the headaches this day has brought, seeing goku get excited to eat fish is not one of them. Bulma again had alot of thoughts but she set those aside.  After a bit, Goku is seen taking out the tungsten dumbbells from his clothes. Bulma watches as goku seems minutely stronger. Bulma shrugs before saying, “Alright, its bedtime goku.” Goku then says, “But I wanna train more.” Bulma then responds, “Well if you wanna feel big and strong in the morning you wanna get some good rest.” Goku then chuckles before trying to sleep in the big bed but Bulma grabs goku screaming, “You aren’t sleeping in my bed!” Goku then says, “but you said.” Bulma then points to an inflatable mattress that seems kinda mediocre but also doesn’t seem bad.

Goku blows up the mattress, figuring out how to pretty quickly to Bulma’s shock. Bulma says, “I again thought you were dumb.” Goku then giggles saying “I pick up on stuff very fast.” With that Goku is given soft blankets and so is Bulma.

Bulma then sleeps on her bed but then thinks, “Goku. I thought he was just a dumbass. You know meathead hick who just loves fighting. But then again. He seems so oddly proficient. And when I had him blow up that mattress, it only took 2 minutes. Most mentally impaired people don’t have that quick of a pick up. Maybe he’s not dumb, maybe he just doesn’t know stuff. Whatever the case is, this won’t be as annoying as I once thought.” Bulma then finally says, “Good night goku.” Goku then says in response, “Good night, friend.”

1nabpur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wonsulting/comments/1nabpur/networking_applying_to_jobs_heres_why/,Networking > Applying to jobs. Here’s why.,"Most people spend hours clicking “Apply” and hear nothing back.

Let’s be real: if you only apply online, you’re in the lowest tier in the hiring process, which means you have the lowest chance.
￼
So if you’re qualified, knowing someone inside the company is way stronger than just dropping your resume into the black hole. That’s the point.

Should you still apply? Yes!!!

But your focus should be building connections that move you up to getting recommendations from hiring managers and team members.

But how do you start networking (without being weird)??
- Ask people you already know: “Hey, do you know the recruiter or hiring manager at X company? Could you introduce me?”
- Reach out on LinkedIn with a short message. Keep it human, not sales-y ￼(ask something that you saw was interesting about their profile or posts)
- Do a quick coffee chat, show genuine interest, and if it feels right, ask for advice or a referral.

The goal isn’t just to “get a referral.” It’s to make someone want to vouch for you… and that’ll give you a better chance of getting interviews and offers.

TLDR: Applying is fine, but networking is the cheat code - you’ll land interviews faster doing that :)",2,1757195095.0,Wonsulting,0,1.0,False

1nabm8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nabm8b/aio_in_wanting_a_divorce/,AIO in wanting a divorce?,"Hi, so I’ve been married  14 years to a vet. We have 5 kids. And a lot has happened in those years we’ve definitely dealt with a lot of loss and just life’s hardships. Well a few years into our marriage we both had an emotional affair, he fell into a deep depression and wouldn’t talk to me, he said it was because my life was perfect and he didn’t want me looking down on him, and I found a friend I worked with that just became a easy confidant. I did ask much about the girl, cause he ended up loosing that job and they never spoke again. We tried to just work through it on our own, mainly because he doesn’t believe in counseling and won’t stick with it . He has some mental illness and hasn’t consistently taken any treatment since discovery. 
Well a few years ago I found his spank bank - which in all honesty I was upset about but thought it was a typical guy thing to have a few admirers and didn’t trip too much but the discovery led to finding screenshots that he took off instagrams that were from some of my colleagues and my closest friends sm pages. Photos of them in bathing suits and work out clothes. The photos of my friend who at the time would come over all the time was what made me loose it. He came clean about a porn addiction, previous pill addiction and a bipolar 2 and ptsd diagnosis, and promised he wouldn’t keep anything like this from me. He started therapy for all of like 3 months. I started therapy myself always being a huge advocate for it and shifted my focuses to building my career since I’d put it on hold while he was finishing school. I’d taken a job in my field but it wasn’t what I wanted to do because of how much time it took to build the book of business I’d need to actually maintain. 

Fast forward (5yrs) to recently I’ve been periodically checking his fb and know that he’s still searching for random woman that he interacts with and porn stars. I’ve found texts messages asking girls he works with on dates to hike and coffee, but most recently I found that he searched for that same old friends social media I found a screen shot he must of accidentally taken in his deleted folder I honestly don’t even know what made me check the deleted photos section and now I’m wrecked. 

I know there are so many more reason I should be upset - just the fact that he’s searching the woman -, but I guess I felt more untouchable knowing they’re typical pornstars and the people he works with I’ve never interact with. And it makes it even more ridiculous typing this out smh!  But my friends feels way to personal and then pound on all the other stuff. 

I won’t play innocent I’ve definitely been way to friendly with my ex (high school sweet heart) when they first found out I moved cross country,and they were close with my family so it took a bit for my husband to feel like I was committed I guess. He’s saw a conversation( I’m not defending my actions) but I told my ex “I’d always have love for him and he’d always have a piece of my heart but that I was happy”… when he found out he flipped on me. A year later I found out he had been taking a girl on dates after his classes and that was his way of kind of “evening the scale” he said since I was talking to them he “thought he could do the same” and he’d asked me to move out with the kids, at that point I was in no position to be on my own with the boys so I said I’d stay and he leave, and he just all of a sudden wanted to work on thinks, this was about a year before finding the spank bank. 

I do get a ton of attention I’m in a high demand career that puts me in-front of a lot of well paid and high value men, but I’ve never given any of them a reason to think I was available and try keeping myself extremely modest although I haven’t worn my ring for years. My husband has said multiple times he thinks I’m going to leave him for someone else, and asks that I “give him time to get his self where he want and then he will give our marriage time” but he can go days with out speaking to me when he’s in his bipolar episode and bingeing  on the games for days at a time in his free time. He doesnt take the initiative for dates, or even just intentional time between the two of us, he says he can’t give me the in tams y I want because I always want deep conversation, and I don’t give him enough physical touch. Honestly its just like having a 5th child. My hesitation is that I have all boys and my career has just gotten to a wonderful place where I actually feel like I can do this, I’m so scared I’m going to regret it all if I ask for a divorce. And safety is also a huge thing in the back of my mind he’s had suicidal thoughts the first time I asked for a separation. 

I should also mention he struggles with ED so I don’t think he will sleep with anyone else but I also have this nagging feeling that he’s maybe not slept with but done something with my friend. She moved away not long after I found out about the photos I think that was totally God protecting me more ways than one. Anyway I know this is all over and a hot mess should I just hush and let a man be a man or is this like really valid for me to want to be done with it all. I will need to save and really plan out what to do and that also makes me so nervous. I’ve went from being with my parents to getting married at 19 and moving where ever the military sent us for 6 years, and then settling across the country from all of my family…. I just want to know I’m not crazy maybe. And yes I’m going back to therapy next week. ",1,1757194827.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1nabljk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nabljk/aitah_for_crying_in_front_of_my_roommates_friend/,AITAH for crying in front of my roommates friend?,"I (29 F) recently moved in with my roommate and friend, who I'll call Flower (26 F). 

Things were really exciting, but then they got stressful when I was unable to find employment within the first month. I broke down crying, which my roommate told me made her really uncomfortable and she couldn't handle it. So I vowed not to cry in front of her again, and I started journaling and doing other things to manage my emotions. I was doing really well, I thought. I hadn't cried in a few weeks.

Yesterday she told me she was bringing a friend over after work that she wanted to introduce me to. I'll call him Tree (M 25) She said he had a very dark sense of humour, and to be prepared for it. I wanted this person to like me because they're friends with my roommate, who I really like.

At first things were going well. We were having a total normal conversation about different media we're all into. He was throwing in some dark jokes about true crime and things like that, and I was just rolling with it. 

Then, the topic changed to a short film they wanted to make. Well, I happen to work in film and so I was trying to encourage them saying it was a great idea. My roommate told me how they wanted it to look and I recommended a camera, and then I offered to help them. See, in film circles, it's typical for people to volunteer on each others projects. It's considered nice, but looking back, I think Tree thought I was trying to insert myself into their project and I think this might by why things took a turn. But I don't know for sure. 

He says ""Well, it won't be for a long time cause we need to film it in California"" (This is very far from where we live) I asked why and he said they just have to, I asked what specifically about California and he said the desert. I said there were deserts closer to us, but he insisted on California. Realizing my mistake I tried to remedy the situation by saying ""Oh I get that. I've been to California too and I really loved it there"". Then... It all went to hell.

He tells me he hated California, which really caught me off guard, and how can I like it there? I just said all the people I met there were really nice, and I told this stupid story I always tell about going into the Dunkin' Donuts and the girl working there was so nice to me, and even though I was just getting a coffee it was such a wonderful experience that I still remember.

He said ""They have to do that or else they'll take them out back and shoot them"". I thought he was joking, he had been making jokes like this all night. I stupidly replied in a joking manner ""Well, I guess it works because she was really nice."" 

I could tell right then that something shifted. He started saying all this stuff to me I honestly can't even remember, but about how I'm the enemy and my politics must be terrible. I didn't even know we were talking politics!

I panicked and started trying to explain that I thought he was joking, and of course I don't really think that, and I don't even think retail workers should have to be nice to everyone and I worked retail and I know how hard it is, and I was just going on and on trying to explain myself because I felt like he thought I was a conservative now, or some kind of extremist and I'm really not. And I just felt so much anxiety for being perceived as this person I'm not that I started crying. 

They were both like, ""calm down, it's cool it's cool,"" and I felt really embarrassed so I just wiped my face and laughed it off and tried to move on. 

About an hour later, my roommate walked their friend home, and when she came back she told me I really embarrassed her and that I was acting like a teenager, and that I needed to control my emotions better. I felt really bad and I tried to apologize but she said not to apologize because it wouldn't fix anything anyways.

1nabitb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nabitb/toys_part_ii/,TOYS Part II,"“That doesn’t make any sense,” Jess said, folding a towel with brisk, practiced motions. We had the bed between us, the basket half-empty, slumping towers of laundry softening the space.

“I know,” I said. “But it wasn’t there yesterday. I swear. That toybox – it just showed up.”

Jess didn’t look up. “We didn’t bring one in.”

“No. I mean—we didn’t. I didn’t.”

She gave a small, dry exhale. Not quite a sigh. “She’s a kid, Rob. She’s got an imagination. Like you. You feed that in her.”

I dropped the shirt I’d been folding, ran a hand over my face. “It’s not just what she said. It’s how she said it. Like she didn’t think it was strange at all.”

Jess finally met my eyes. “You’re wound tight lately. She’s playing. That’s what kids do.”

Every creak in the floorboards sounded different now, like the house was learning new ways to speak. Even if nothing had changed—except for that one, glistening black addition.

“I keep checking on her,” I muttered. “She’s always fine. Watching TV, playing with Snacks. But –”

“But?”

I paused, trying to slow my thoughts down. I’d hardly been able to work after what Win had told me, and Jess was right. I did have a big imagination.

But every creak I heard upstairs, every time Win came bounding down the steps, I felt it. The living music of the house had a different cadence. There was a wrongness I couldn’t name. Like something was just…off. And yet Win was happy. Playing with her new toy.

Milkshake.

“It’s just,” I said, “it didn’t feel like make-believe.”

“Well of course not,” she said, “because it was just a dream or something babe. Seriously. Kid’s say weird things sometimes.”

I tried not to bristle. Jess was just like this – the practical one, measured. The planner. She kept us grounded and I was glad she did. She encouraged me, she kept me hopeful. And I loved her so much for that.

But in that moment? I just wanted someone to reassure me. The same someone I shared a bed with.

“Then how do you explain the toy?”

Jess put her towel onto a pile of others, each folded straight and neat. She sighed.

“She probably found it somewhere in the house,” Jess said, “I mean, there were clearly kids living here before us. Maybe they left some of their toys laying around. Probably the same with the box.”

And then, quietly and under her breath – “You must have missed it.”

She meant the board in Win’s closet, the one with the names and dates carved into the wood. Candace and Marie. We’d found other pieces of them in the weeks after we’d fully moved in – marker scribbles on the baseboards upstairs, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed. A couple old photographs tucked away in a coat closet – two little girls with their parents all bundled up in early-90’s puffers, red-cheeked and smiling.

Those artifacts made sense to me. You live in a place long enough, you leave something behind. A sock under the bed. A feeling in the walls.  

But the snake?

Milkshake didn’t feel left behind. To me, Milkshake felt *placed*.

“I don’t know,” I said, sitting down on the edge of the bed, “I guess I just don’t like it. It was filthy.”

“So wait until she’s asleep and take it away,” Jess said, hoisting the folded towels in her arms and turning toward the closet.

“But she’s been carrying it around all day,” I said, “she’ll hate me.”

“She won’t hate you,” Jess called from the closet, muffled, “we’ll get her something else this weekend. I saw a flier at the store for a farmer’s market on Sundays – maybe we’ll find her another stuffed snake or whatever.”

“Yeah,” I said called back, taking up my shirt again.

But what I thought to myself was – *Jesus. I hope not*.

\*\*

It took until Jess was nearly asleep for me to make up my mind.

I crept, sneaking as quietly as I could, trying to remember where all the squeaking places were in the floorboards under the carpet that lined the upstairs hallway. I kept the lights out, afraid if I turned them on the splash of bright might wake up Win. I made it all the way to her room in the dark.

And then I opened the door.

The room was dark – darker than the hall. We’d brought our old black-out curtains from the apartment for her windows, covering both in case we needed to put her to bed before the sun had fully set. There wasn’t even a drop of moonlight to light my way.

After a moment I could see a little better, lingering in the doorway. Win was bundled up in her blankets, her back to me, facing the wall. Her toys were scattered about the floor, waiting for the morning. To be arranged.

I scanned them, looking for the snake. I took several long moments to look, but I couldn’t see Milkshake anywhere.

I heard Win sigh, turn around on the bed. I froze, feeling ridiculous, like a cartoon character caught snooping. My back arched, my arms up, bracing myself.

I almost giggled when I heard her sleep-breathing. Her mouth open, she was deep into her dreams. There was something so special about hearing her sleep so peacefully. I hoped then that that feeling would never go away.

But hope is a trap. Sometimes there are nasty surprises waiting in its underbelly, and the sweeter you wish, the more vile what waits underneath the other side of wanting can be.

Her breathing had a little rasp to it. I made a mental note to dust upstairs again that weekend. The house got dusty, and Win wasn’t used to such an old space. All of the grit that builds up in such a lived in place, no matter how hard you clean.

My secret joy drained just a little when I saw the other thing in Win’s bed. Of course it was there. The snake, a dark squiggle in the dark, laid out next to her, its black curves stark against her bright emerald bedsheets.

I felt stupid, I felt like I was breaking some sort of trust, sneaking into her room like that in the middle of the night. Planning to take something away from her that so very clearly gave her joy. At least, I resolved, I would get it away from her in the morning. Wash it before I took it back up to her room. I was afraid it had mold somewhere inside it, from the way it smelled. From the feel of its brittle skin.

And I was just about to turn around, about to sneak back into bed to Jess, when I heard it.

A slow, moaning creak.

I turned, fast and hard. Spinning around on the carpet, all thoughts of sneaking fleeing my mind. And I looked at the shadowed space.

At first I didn’t see anything.

Even though my eyes had adjusted to the dark, the shadows in the nook were darker still. I squinted from where I stood in the middle of the room, between the nook and Win’s bed, and looked deeper. Rats, my mind wanted to jump to rats. Old houses had rats, right?

But then I heard something else. The click of a hinge, a hollow wooden thump. The toybox lid – I was sure of it.

Yawning gently closed.   

My hand shot to my pocket, reaching for my phone. Cursing to myself when I remembered I had left it on the bedside table, plugged into the phone charger. The thought of how far away the phone was then, how naked and helpless I felt without it, made me feel limp. Isolated.

“Hello,” I called, in a whisper.

But there was only silence. It rushed in to fill the space my voice ate up, smothering it. The kind of silence that’s like white noise in and of itself. Static.

The hair on my arms stood up. A mixture of a sudden chill and a growing certainty that I was being watched. Being seen, some dull dark eyes in the dark.

“*Daddy*?”

I turned around again and saw Win sitting up in bed. The lump of her shadowed form under her blankets.

“Baby,” I said, “did you hear something?”

I thought I could make out Win shaking her head in the dark, alert. Her voice sounded muffled, almost pitched.

“*Can I turn on my nightlight Daddy?*”

I could barely see her face, but she sounded scared. Pleading. Something under it, like all the fear I felt had caught on to her. Like it was squeezing her, urgent.

“Yes baby,” I said, feeling stupid that I hadn’t thought of that myself, “please, turn it on.”

I turned back towards the nook, ready for the light to fill up the room. Ready to see whatever was waiting in there.

“*I can’t reach it Daddy*,” I heard her behind me.

I turned back to my girl. She was bundled up still, curling up farther into her blankets. I tried to smile, even though she probably couldn’t see it. To reassure her.

“It’s right by your bed sweetie,” I said, nodding. Encouraging her.

“*I’m scared*,” she said, her voice falling suddenly small. Tiny.

I shuffled over to the end of her bed. The lamp was there, on her bedside table – a Minnie Mouse lamp, her kicking form silhouetted in the blackness. The switch was her hand, and I reached for it, turning it around clockwise.

Darting my gaze back to the nook as light filled the room.

And I did see something there.

A shock of dark black hair, splayed out on the floor. Spilling through the threshold of the nook. My heart jumped, my chest hitching, as I saw it stir. Slither on the floor.

Then my dad instincts kicked in. Flowing through me right after the shock of the sight of the hair. A rage, that someone or something was in my little girl’s room. Hiding and waiting for her.

I strode over to the nook, grabbing one of Win’s tiny tennis racquets in my hand as I did – ready to club the thing to hell.

I stopped in the doorway.

Win was there, curled up in the space at the end of the nook. She was laying on her side, her back to me. Her hair splayed out behind her. The toybox, closed and dark in the shadow, stood next to her.

It was Win’s hair I’d seen.

I froze. That feeling of being watched returned to me. Pushing everything else away.

Because if Win was in the closet, who had been in her bed?

Slowly, slowly, I turned my head back to Win’s bed. My eyes falling over every inch of the room leading to it, my gaze sweeping slow. Doomed, like it was being pulled to the bed.

To whatever was waiting for me, wrapped up in the covers.

But when my eyes finally fell there, all I could see were blankets. Lumped and piled up like someone was underneath them. And, as I watched, they slumped. Fell back into themselves. Deflated.

There was nothing there in the bed. Nothing except for Win’s blankets.

And, of course, Milkshake.

I turned back to the nook, my heart bashing against my ribs, and bent over Win. Scooped her up in my hands. She moaned, half-asleep, as I lifted her up off the floor. Stepping as quick as I could with her in my arms out of the nook. Out of the bedroom.

I took her downstairs and laid her across my lap on the couch. She stirred against me, but only a little. She was still asleep, still young enough to be lifted up and away, asleep through it all. So trusting and so safe.

And I didn’t see it at first what she’d been holding. I had been so quick to get her out of that room, so quick to carry her downstairs, that I had hardly noticed the shape in her hands. But there, in the glow of the TV, I got a good look at it.

It was another toy, another crocheted shape. This one was a little girl. It was crude. The legs and arms no more than fleshy points. It had the same color scale as Milkshake – ash and boney white. All of course except for its eyes.

They were blue. Tiny sapphires in the stitched head. They caught the flickering light from the TV – shining bright and livid.  

Something about the doll rang a familiar bell in me. It couldn’t have been one of Win’s other toys, I knew that – I would never have forgotten something so worn. So wet. But at the same time…I felt like I’d seen it before.

I met the thing’s stare. Grunting. Then I reached down and took the toy from Win’s hands. Her grip relaxed, weak in sleep. I felt the toy and felt that odd cold in its fibers – just like Milkshake.

“Fuck. You,” I said, my voice hard. I threw the thing into the corner of the living room, watched it hit the wall and slide behind the armchair we had there, hearing it skitter to a stop against the baseboards.

Then, with a sigh, I hugged my girl. Hugged her close to my chest and closed my eyes tight against her. Wishing she was dreaming of something good. Something peaceful, free of worry. 

Wishing again and again.

Wishing.

\*\*

I woke up shaking. Violently.

I started, sitting straight up. Almost too fast, because Win was still asleep on my lap. When I saw her there, I froze, hugging her close to me so I didn’t knock her on the floor.

I felt the hand then, on my shoulder.

“Hey,” Jess’s voice from behind me, “*hey*.” 

I turned around, seeing her standing behind the couch. She was dressed for work, lit up from behind by the morning sun, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Her eyes were wide.

“What’s going on?” she asked.

“Shit,” I said, grimacing, “we must have fallen asleep on the couch.”

“I can see that,” Jess said, turning around fast. Too fast. An about-face.

She was pissed.

“Jess,” I called, still getting used to the bright light of morning, “*Jess*.”

She didn’t turn around, was bending over to get her shoes on. Slipping them on, pushing her heels down in them so hard they screeched against the wood floor. I winced, Win stirring in my lap. I tried to move her off of me, carefully and slowly, and I managed to get her onto the cushion beside me. I stood up, my wince deepening – sleeping like that on the couch had put a crick my back.

“Babe,” I said, “I’m sorry. She…she had a bad dream.”

I don’t know why I lied then. Maybe it was because I’d hoped that it was the truth. Not that the bad dream was Win’s, in my wish.

It had been mine.

“I woke up,” she said, hushed, her back to me still, “and I didn’t know where you were.”

“I get it,” I said, trying to reach a hand to her shoulder, in an offering. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep, it just happened.”

Jess rejected my touch, and shrugged my hand off. I let it drop to my side, sighing. Trying not to let my sleep-soaked mind carry me to anger.

“Nothing’s wrong,” I almost whispered. “Nothing, babe.”

She stopped, going still. Her back to me. I saw her shoulders sink, by an inch. Then I saw them hitch. Heard her take a breath in, heard it catch.

And I knew what she was thinking.

A few years ago, when Win was just a toddler, I was in a bad place. I had just gotten laid off from my job during the pandemic, and my girls were all I had. Every day I was home alone with them, while Jess scrambled to support us, and my feeling of failure grew. Because – here were these two wonderful loves of mine, the lights in my sky, and as much as I loved the chance to spend time with them – I couldn’t help but feel like every day I couldn’t help get us back on our feet…that I was disappointing them. Failing them. Jess never said anything of the sort to me, and I don’t think she thought it either, but sometimes the worst thoughts we have about ourselves can build up inside us – booming echoes with nowhere to go. Bounding and reverberating through our heads all day until the pressure builds to cook. Frying our sense of reality.

I took Jess’s success for granted. The extra work she did, the more time she spent away from home, I processed as her needing more time away from me. From her loser husband, trapped at home. Win went through a hard spot herself, getting sick from the virus. She was hard to manage, and I spent a few very isolated weeks with her, Jess staying at her parents so she could still do everything she could to work to make up for our loss of income.

I spun stories in my head about the worst-case scenarios. That she was having an affair. That Win was growing to resent me, that all she would associate me with for the rest of her life was sickness. Loneliness.

And none of it was true of course. But, at the time, it felt like the truth. It was what I *wanted* to believe. Because, really, I was just punishing myself. And very unfairly.

So, one night, after Jess came back, I tried to talk to her. She was exhausted – from overworking and also the relief she felt being home at the old apartment again, I’m sure. She didn’t know what I had smoldering inside of me, the thick stew of self-loathing I’d been seeping in for weeks.

She took something I said – I can’t even remember what it was now – with a light heart. Not really willing to hear me. And that hurt me bad, at the time.

So, I waited for her to fall asleep. I sat in bed and watched her, watched how at peace she seemed to be. Seething with an un-real lie.

Then I walked out of the apartment, got in the car, and drove. I drove for a whole night and most of the next day. Not really knowing where I was going.

Jess called me once and then several times in a row. I ignored all of them. It was petty, it was childish. But I was not myself.

I came to my senses at a rest-stop, somewhere a couple of states over. Watching the sun come up over a copse of trees down the hill from the trucker-lot. Something about the time away from the two of them, about how much worse it made me feel, got me to call Jess back.

We talked for a while on the phone there, until the sun was almost setting again behind me and the woods ahead were alive with shadows. We talked a lot more on the drive home. And a whole hell of a lot more once I got there. We had a couple of hard, hard nights. But then, slowly yet wonderfully, a couple of better ones.

And then, some of the best.

“Baby,” I said, coming up behind her, sliding my arms around her waist. Hugging her from behind. “Nothing’s wrong, I promise.”

She turned around to me then, and I reached a hand up to wipe a tear off her cheek. Careful not to smudge her makeup.

“Promise?” she asked, her voice small and close to cracking.

“Swear,” I said. Kissing her.

A few moments later I was watching her go, waving from the front door. She waved back, a little smile on her lips. I watched the car go down the road until the taillights were too small to see the red.

Before shutting the door. Before letting my gaze linger above me, to the ceiling. On the other side, on the second floor, was exactly where Win’s room was.

I sat there for a moment. I listened. Wishing, really wishing, that I could believe my own lie.

\*\*

I could barely work that day, and after a few hours of half-hearted email-sorting and responding to IM’s, I had accepted that the events of the night before rendered me useless. I put myself in offline-mode and sent a message to my team that I would be out the rest of the day and shut my laptop.

Win was running around like nothing happened. After she woke up, I made her pancakes and set them for her at the table. I watched her eat them, the TV in the living room blaring an old Disney musical, while I drank my coffee. Questions surging up my tongue were begging to come out.

*‘Do you remember anything weird about last night?*’

*‘Why did you fall asleep in the closet?’*

*‘Was there something in there with you?’*

What stopped me was the joy, the gleeful nonchalance Win greeted everyday with. Her abandon and her spirit, soaring up as soon as she was, buzzed from the sugary syrup. I let her out into the backyard where she ran to her soccer ball, kicking it between the trees. I watched her from the back door, drinking cup after cup of coffee.

I wished I could have her energy. Her fearlessness. I wished I could have gotten away with drinking something stronger than coffee.

Surely, I reasoned with myself, if she had seen anything – if there had actually been anything there, in the room with us, Win would have remembered. The girl could see a caterpillar on the sidewalk in the morning and talk about it all the way until bedtime, until the next day even, urging us to walk back to where she’d seen it crawling a full day before to see if it was still there.

Which meant if she had seen something, if she had seen what I’d seen, she would have said something.

Right?

Unless, I thought, she couldn’t see it. Unless what had been in her bed that night had just been for me.

I shook my head, trying to upend the thoughts souring my mind, like I could loose them out of my ears. This was a new house, a new space, and I was filling it with my fear as much as we had filled it with our wonder, with our joy and our hope. There wasn’t anything else here with us. It was just an old, creepy house and I – this man who had spent his whole life in the suburbs and the city and considered a two-bedroom apartment just over a thousand square feet a living luxury – just wasn’t used to what dwelling in a place like this meant.

Yeah. That was it.

It had to be.

I almost lost myself in watching her, in the peace that was filling in the morning, when I remembered the toy. The doll. The little girl.

I walked away from the back door, hurrying over to where I had thrown the thing the night before. Shoving the couch back, wincing as it screeched along the hardwood floor. Flicking open the flashlight on my phone to look into the dark of the corner.

I half expected it to be gone. To be a figment, a little resident of a night I was so dearly hoping had been a dream.

But it wasn’t gone. It was exactly where I had left it: facedown in the gathering dust under the couch.

I bent to pick it up. God, it was still cold. A kind of chill in its fibers that made me think it was wet. But, as I brought it out of the dark, I ran my thumb across the stiches of the thing’s dress – they were dry. Coarse, rough like a raw rope.

I looked through the kitchen to make sure Win was occupied and happy – she was, kicking the ball and weaving in and out of the old trees back there. I bounded up the stairs, taking them two at a time, almost running to her room.

I stopped in the doorway.

Her blankets were bunched up on the bed, just as they had been the night before. In the light of morning, they seemed a harmless pile. Her comforter and sheets, wound up in a conical shape. It had been so dark the night before – was it so far fetched to assume I had dreamed up the whole thing? That maybe I had heard Win talking in her sleep and given her voice to the shape in the bed instead of the girl in the nook?

I saw Milkshake’s tail, poking out from between the blanketed folds. I reached for it, pulling it free. It was still so cold, despite spending the night buried in the blanket. I had a thought then to rip it open, Milkshake and the girl both, and see what the hell was inside. What gave them such a chill.

I felt it again then – that same prickling from being watched. I turned, slowly, expecting, *hoping* to see Win in the doorway: watching me. Imagining her devastated little face as I took her new toys; because that was what I was doing, I was sure now. I was taking them and I was going to destroy them.

Burn them, maybe. Warm them up.

But Win wasn’t in the doorway. It was empty, but I heard –

The soft shriek of hinges. The click of a latch.

I whipped toward the nook.

You know that feeling when something flickers at the edge of your vision—when you’re sure it’s there, but the moment you turn your head you catch only the briefest trace? I read once that it’s your mind filling in the gaps, a leftover instinct from our lizard brains—priming you to run before you even know what you’ve seen.

The toybox was there. Blacker than the shadows around it. Waiting.

I stepped inside, frowning as I did. The air in the nook was near freezing. Not normal cold – this was deep, cellar-cold. It made the hair on my arms stand on end.

Upstairs rooms don’t feel like that. Heat rises.

I knelt, flipping open my phone and switching on the flashlight. Shadows danced as I pressed my palm along the baseboards, searching for a draft, a crack. Some rend in the wall, some reason the space could be this chilled. Nothing. My hand rose higher. The cold sharpened near my face, like an invisible seam slicing through the air.

I followed it. Fingers outstretched. They touched something solid. Hard.

The toybox.

I slid my hand along its lid until I found the seam. The cold seeped out there, steady and unnatural.

I gripped the edge. Pulled.

Nothing.

I squatted, planted my feet, and hauled upward with all my weight. The lid didn’t shudder. It might as well have been nailed shut – or part of the floor itself.

I pressed my ear close. A faint hum trembled through the wood—distant and hollow, like something shifting deep – somewhere in the house.

I staggered back, breath fogging. My flashlight trembled.

It must have been a trick of the light. That’s what I told myself. Because the shadow beneath the toybox… it wasn’t thinning as I stared. It looked deeper. Farther away.

I reached out, slowly. My hand hovered over the crack of the lid.

Of the mouth.

For a split second, I thought it wouldn’t stop. That I’d just keep reaching, shoulder-deep, swallowed whole inside the solid square of black.

Instead, my fingers hit wood.

I jerked back.

“That’s all you are,” I whispered. “Just a trick of the dark.”

I stood up, walking quickly out of Win’s room. Hurrying down the stairs. Wanting very, very much to be out in the sunlight with my girl.

Because, for a sliver of a moment? I’d thought my hand wouldn’t touch that glistening wood. I thought it would go on and on. Stretching backwards into a space I would have to crawl into, I would have to push myself through, to find the end of.

It was impossible, I thought. My sleep-weak mind playing with me. Showing me something that simply could not be.

I set Milkshake and the doll down on the counter, hiding them behind a glass container of dried pasta so Win wouldn’t see. Resolving, promising, myself that as soon as Jess was home tomorrow to distract our girl I would take the knit little fucks out back, behind the shed.

And burn them.

\*\*

I woke up with a shudder, groggy and weightless, like I’d been held underwater. The edges of a dream slipping away from me. One in which my daughter held me, in which was staring down at me.

In the dream I couldn’t breathe.

I blinked, looking around our room in the dark. Taking in several deep, shuddering breaths. As the sleep and the dream drained out of me, I found the uneven shadows from all our half-unpacked belongings scattered around our bed a comfort. That was a kind of mess, the remnants of our shuffled life, was at least ours. It made sense. I could feel Jess’s legs pressed against me, her back turned, her form under the blanket rising and falling with silent sleeping.

My eyes caught something in the gloom.

\*CLICK\*

I squinted, leaning forward in the dark.

Another *click.* Sharp. Hollow. Rhythmic.

I turned my head toward the doorway. My heart quickened.

Win stood there.

Barefoot. Motionless. Her face lost in shadow.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

The sound was coming from her.

I swallowed. “Win?”

She didn’t move.

Jess stirred slightly beside me but didn’t wake.

“Baby?” My voice was low. Careful. I sat up, feet on the floor.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her jaw. I saw it now, lit from the moonlight pouring from the hallway window. Her mouth opening and shutting, teeth meeting teeth, each clack sharp in the quiet.

I reached for the lamp on my nightstand.

The room exploded in light.

Win was staring right at me.

She didn’t blink. Didn’t speak. Just stood there in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep, eyes wide and glassy in the glow, *CLICK CLICK CLICK*, her teeth snapping together – hard, sharp and insistent.

My breath caught.

“Sweetheart,” I said softly, standing, “come here.”

She didn’t move.

I stepped to her in three quick strides, crouching to her level. She tilted her head up at me, never breaking that awful rhythm. *CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her bottom lip trembled, but she didn’t cry. Didn’t say anything at all.

“Win,” I whispered, “does it hurt?”

Her eyes shot to me. Wide, glistening.

Then, slowly, she opened her mouth wider.

One of her bottom teeth teetered, loose and pale in the light, hanging by the root. A pale little pearl.

*CLICK.*                                                                                                                                                

There was no blood.

*CLICK.*

I reached out, my fingers shaking, and brushed it gently. It tipped sideways in her gums.

“Teef dad-gdy,” she said through her gaping mouth, her throat and tongue working to make the words with a wide-open jaw, “my teef.”

“Jesus,” I murmured. “Okay, honey. Okay.”

She just kept staring, mouth half-open, teeth clicking together, even as I scooped her up and carried her back toward her room.

Her jaw worked the whole way.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

I laid her down in her bed, her eyes fluttering half-way closed. Resting her head on her pillow. Her mouth worked, opening and closing, as I stuck my fingers inside.

“Hold on honey,” I said, feeling her close her jaw, her tongue slithering away from my thumb, “let me get it.”

There was almost no resistance as I pulled the thing out. As soon as I did, Win’s head relaxed against the pillow, her fluttering eyes twitching shut. She started breathing, heavy, as I leaned back from her bed. Looking at the boney little pebble in my hand.

Looking at my girl, already asleep in her bed.

She was three, halfway to four. I hadn’t prepared myself to even think of when she would start losing teeth but…at her age?

It seemed wrong. Kids don’t lose teeth this young, I thought. Not unless something’s pulling at them.

*Click*.

There was a different sort of sound, a different sort of hollow snap. And it from behind me.

I jumped, turning in the dark of Win’s room.

Toward the nook.

And I felt the temperature shift – a putrid gust. Just a gash of air.

I stared down at the tooth again in my palm. Maybe it was all in my mind, or maybe it was the snap of air from the nook. But I knew what I felt.

The tooth, in my palm, was cooling. Feeling more and more like a little chip of ice. Bloodless, too tiny, and dry. I squeezed my hand shut over it, watching Win’s small chest rising and falling. The breeze from the nook brushed the back of my neck, cold and sour.

And I wondered with a twist in my heart – what if she’s not losing her teeth?

What if they’re being taken?",1,1757194580.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1nabiep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nabiep,My Flex Journey,"So far...   I've been wanting to learn calligraphic script and different types of writing. I've been taking a little online course to help, but I'm still a novice to all of this. I have been searching for a really good flex nib pen. Hopefully, this will help someone who is new to flex and wanting to try a flexible nib. We have some flex writing pros on here who are so experienced and write so beautifully, so the search function for this subreddit has been and continues to be a great source. So here's what I have learned:

**Vintage:** Beautiful, pricey, and definitely buyer beware. My first buy was a Mabie Todd that needed restoration and the nib was not flexible (I dipped it). I'm still deciding what to do with it.  My Waterman 42 is a beautiful pen, wonderful condition, restored, and works great. Is it a wet noodle? No, not by any means. It was advertised (by a seller on the bay of E's using a license tag in their ads) as a flexible nib. I have found it to be semi-flex at best. Still, I love this pen. It was the most I've spent for flex so far. 

**Osprey:**  They seem like nice folks and a good company. The pen I ordered is pretty. It leaks at the threads where the nib section screws into the body. The nib is stiff. Little to no flex, and no spring on the nib at all. I can force it to flex, but it isn't a good feel and any flex requires more force than should be necessary. 

**FPR:**  Again, he seems like a nice guy and I had a good ordering experience. My first pen, with chrome clip and cap ring, was nonworking when I received it. I emailed him and he was good to reply. He told me to stay away from Serenity Blue ink, as many folks have had trouble with it in a flex pen. I was surprised. I ended up watching youtube videos, buying some silicone grease and brass sheets. The Himalaya railroaded endlessly, dry started constantly, and leaked at just about every location of threads (the cap threads were okay). After emailing with the owner, he sent me a whole new writing section for this pen, and I am very thankful for that.  Did a lot of ""messing around"" with the nib and feed and threads, and now this pen writes with some flex. The pen flexes now, but the thin lines are also not thin enough. 

**FPR Again:**  After working through to some success with the first pen, and ordering some supplies and other nibs, I tried again with the same color pen, Peacock Aqua, this time with gold clip and cap ring. I added silicone to threads, heat set the nib/feed a couple times, and it writes well, flexes well, has quite a bit of spring, and rarely railroads or dry starts. Fun, flexible, and I've learned a lot about flex writing on the cheap. 

**Jinhao with Osprey Nib:**  Jinhao pen is nice. I put the Osprey nib on the Jinhao feed. No real flex, but it was a bit more springy than the first Osprey nib/pen I tried. I may get a FPR nib and try it on here. 

**Asvine with FPR Nib:**  The Asvine V200 is a good pen, a piston filler. The FPR-FNF #6 Ultra Flex Bock compatible nib unit is compatible with the Asvine V200. So, you order the Asvine V200, also order a Fountain Pen Revolution-Flexible Nib Factory #6 Chrome Ultra Flex Bock Compatible Nib Unit (comes with an ebonite feed) from the Fountain Pen Revolution website. When you have the pen and the nib/feed unit, unscrew the Asvine nib/feed unit out and screw in the FPR nib/feed unit with flex. Viola, you have a flex pen. I did add silicone to the threads of the nib/feed unit. Lots of fun to write with it the nib is good, which mine is. 

Other things I've learned: If you go the Himalaya route, your pen will leak. It just will, so if that staining bothers you, don't get a light colored pen. Both of mine are stained. The second one was treated with silicone at the threads before ever inking it. It still leaks and has a bit of staining on the writing section. I can live with it. 

Cheap flex requires work, research, and hit and miss trial and error experimentation. It may seem like a waste of money, but it can be a learning experience. I feel I know more now than I did. Vintage flex takes money, time, and a trusted seller-buyer relationship. I have my eye on another kind of vintage pen and might try purchasing such a pen in the future. 

Is all this worth the time, effort, and money? Yes. If you want to do flexible writing, it is worth it. If this isn't your jam, don't bother with it. I want to flex write. I want a wet noodle that will transport me to the nirvana of writing, with razor thin thin strokes, and wide strokes that will knock you over. The pens I am using now offer plenty of flex while I'm learning to write this way. It is fun!!!

Okay, let’s be real for a sec… how many of you have found yourselves lost in the abyss of doomscrolling? 😩 You know, that mind-numbing scrolling through bad news, social media drama, and conspiracy theories that make your head spin? Trust me, I’ve been there, and it’s exhausting! But what if I told you there’s a way to turn that screen time into *cash money*? 💸

Let’s chat about AI content creation. Seriously, it's the *perfect antidote* to those endless scrolling sessions. Instead of diving into the depths of despair, why not dive into the world of content creation and start dollar-scrolling? 🤔

Here’s why you NEED to get in on this ASAP:

- **The future is now**: AI tech is advancing faster than we can keep up with. Have you noticed how chatbots are basically taking over everything? The demand for quality content is skyrocketing, and guess what? You can be on the cutting edge of that wave!
  
- **Your creativity matters**: You don't need to be a tech genius to get started. All you need is a sprinkle of imagination and a desire to express yourself. Plus, how cool would it be to blend your passions with something as innovative as AI?

- **Flexibility**: You can work from anywhere! Pajama pants while churning out content? Yes, please! 🛋️ Just think about it… sipping coffee on the couch, creating engaging content that earns you a sweet side hustle, or even a full-time gig.

- **Passive income potential**: Imagine creating a blog, an e-book, or even social media content that continues to earn for you long after you hit ""publish."" Sounds dreamy, right?

### A few things to consider before you leap into dollar-scrolling:

1. **Learn the tools**: Familiarize yourself with AI writing tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or Writesonic. It sounds more complex than it is, and you’ll be whipping up content faster than you can say “dollar-scrolling”! 🥳

2. **Find your niche**: What are you passionate about? Travel? Cooking? Tech? Whatever it is, there is an audience waiting for your unique voice. Don’t overthink it—just start sharing!

3. **Consistency is key**: It’s like a garden: you have to plant seeds (aka consistent content) before you can harvest the fruits of your labor. No one’s saying you need to post daily, but staying consistent will pay off.

4. **Monitor results**: Use analytics to see how your content is performing. If something’s not working, don’t sweat it—just adapt and try again!

So, what’s holding you back from jumping into this exciting world of AI content income? Fear of failure? Impostor syndrome? We all feel that sometimes, but the digital landscape is yours for the taking!

**Remember:** The clock’s ticking! 💥 You can either scroll through misery or start scrolling towards that financial freedom you’ve always dreamed of. Are you ready to join the dollar-scrolling revolution?",1,1757194469.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I am a christian and believe in forgiveness, so after some time I gave him another chance. The second time I found out that he cheated on me, I confronted him and he actually laughed at me and played it off as no big deal. I knew at that moment I had to protect my peace, so I left him. On paper it was an easy break because we did not live together, were not financially tied together, and did not have any shared assets. This was a very hard break up for me because I thought we would ride off into the sunset together. There were points I wanted to die, but I stayed strong and have maintained a year with absolutely no contact. I don’t use social media, so he has no way of knowing what I have done/doing with my life. During that time apart, I have been working through my personal issues and feelings, and have noticed there were a lot of red flags that I ignored. 

A couple of those redflags: He was not financially stable and was accumulating massive amounts of debt, either with school loans or reckless spending habits. He would often lie while online shopping, saying he did not receive the item/it was bad, and then just keeping them for himself. His family has a lot of underlying mental problems and I believe he has a form of BPD, but he would not go to therapy. He would emotionally and verbally abuse me, which destroyed my self confidence. When he would do something wrong, he would gaslight me or get a tattoo of my name on his body to prove his love. And the most alarming is he said “I like the feeling of knowing I have the power if someone lives or dies while doing CPR. He liked the way their chest felt on compressions” (he works in healthcare).

Anyways, back to the reason I am writing this post. After a year of no contact, I ran into him at a coffee shop. When he saw me, he broke down crying, like full on tears and sobbing. I asked if he wanted to sit. He told me that the person he cheated on me with left him. He said that he has no friends and no one to talk to. He has been massively depressed and hates his life. He told me he stopped going to therapy after a few sessions. We talked and I told him how much he hurt me and how bad it was for me after the break up. I did ask some questions like why he would manipulate and gas light me. To which he responded “I'm not sure why”. When I told him he was using his ‘manipulating tone’ with me now, he responded with “am I?’ As if he didn't realize he was doing it. He goes on to say that he has been keeping updates on me through mutual friends and that he drives by my house sometimes to see if I am home. He also said “ he looks for my car around town”. He knows it's my car because one of the hubcaps is missing. The creepy part is I only lost it a month ago, so he has been recently trying to find me. I found it extremely alarming that he has been frequently driving by my house when I am home alone for the past year. After our conversion, we hugged and I left.

Back to my original question, AITAH for not wanting to talk to him now? I feel bad because he has no one and some part of me loves him even with all the shitty things he did to me. He was a big part of my life for half a decade. I know what he did is shitty, but part of me hates that he has been suffering. With his family history, people in his family have removed themselfs from earth and his obvious mental problems, I am worried about his safety. However, after healing myself and remembering how broken he left me. I don’t believe I can go down this road again. I need to protect myself and my peace, so reddit AITAH?",4,1757194439.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False
1nabfqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nabfqj/i_m32_dont_think_i_can_afford_her_f30/,I (M32) don't think I can afford her (F30),"I'm not sure if I am seeking advice or if I just need to jot down my thoughts about what's wrong with my relationship. We just moved across the country together so she could go to grad school. I met her while I was in law school and living off loans. We moved in together after a couple of months of dating, and I think ""incompatibility,"" if you want to call it that, started to emerge thereafter.

The first thing was rent.  
She wouldn't move in with me unless her rent was less than what it currently  
was. So we agreed to a split. I paid $1,200, she paid $600. I was desperately  
in love and wanted to live with her, so I said yes to it, even though deep down  
it made me feel a bit unwanted because why does moving in with your boyfriend  
have to be incentivized by savings?

Then it was other  
expenses. I have friends who have been dating/living with each other for a long  
time, and they said they used SplitWise for groceries and other expenses. I  
brought it up with her a few weeks into dating. I was surprised when she was  
completely opposed to the idea of her paying for groceries. She told me her  
ex-boyfriend covered all rent and food when they had lived together and that  
she expected that I would at least cover all groceries. I was pretty stunned  
and insisted I would not treat her as my adopted child. She split one grocery  
bill with me and then rejected all future requests. I ended up kinda just  
caving.

She also refused to pay  
for internet, insisting that she would never use *any* wifi, and that I was the  
only one who used wifi because she used data. That just wasn't true, but  
whenever I brought up that she was frequently on our wifi, she would just  
insist she only used data and wouldn't pay.

She doesn't know how to  
cook. Like, at all. So while I was slaving through law school, I also prepared  
every single meal for us. This inevitably led to me being too tired sometimes,  
so I would often order pickup. She would rarely if ever order herself food. So  
I either cooked or ordered out basically every single meal of hers. I remember  
one time I was in a rush and just made oatmeal for myself, and she wouldn't  
talk to me for the rest of the day. We also had a french press that would make  
coffee for 2, and a pourover that would only make 1 cup, and she would  
consistently only ever make coffee for herself with the pourover, but insist I  
always use the french press and split the pot, even after she already had 1  
pourover cup. The principle of that really got to me.

She also just didn't wash  
dishes, really. She would sometimes wash small stuff, but she as a rule would  
not wash anything as large or larger than a pan. When I would bring this up,  
she would insist she did *all* of the dishes. That was just a lie. That also got  
to me, the warped reality.

When I graduated from law  
school, my parents gave me about $2,200 to take a little bar road trip. At the  
same time, we were looking for a new apartment in the city where I landed a job  
(where I am now). We found an apartment and signed the lease, and the landlord  
asked for first month and deposit. I paid mine. Then she let me know she  
wouldn't be paying hers and I could just collect the full security deposit at  
the end. She said she would pay me back the rent with loans from grad school.  
So I used my entire graduation gift to cover her rent and deposit. Months  
later, still haven't gotten paid back, and I am honestly pretty bummed that I  
never got to go on that road trip to celebrate graduating law school.

Moving was a riot. She  
basically didn't lift a finger other than sorting through all of her clothes  
(she worked at a vintage store and owned a shit ton of clothing; she actually  
insisted I owned more than her, which was hilariously inaccurate when we actually  
ended up going through and packing our closets). I paid for movers, paid for  
the truck, packed basically everything, cleaned and repaired basically  
everything in our aparmtnet (lol she also didn't pay a security deposit there,  
big surprise), drove thousands of miles to our new apartment without any help,  
and hired movers to unpack the truck. It ended up being thousands of dollars  
and days upon days of labor, which I did with basically no help, though her  
elderly father did come by to help me clean. She covered two hundred dollar  
hotel rooms and had the balls to tell me I was using her because I would have  
paid for the hotel room had she not been there, and because I own most of the  
furniture in our home so I should have paid for all moving expenses because I  
would have moved it without her.

I could honestly go on.  
There's a lot more. But I just don't think I can afford her, and I don't know  
what to do. I want it all to magically change and for her to just find a way to  
carry her load, but its just all on me and it is making me feel so used and  
uncared for. I have to be so stern about spending and strict with myself just  
to make everything work, and I get snappy and mean when things are tight. But  
no matter how many times we fight about spending and sharing expenses, nothing  
changes.

My only real concern is that I genuinely enjoy our conversations and I don’t want to make things awkward between us if and ruin our relationship if she says no. It’s also just a minimum wage retail job so it’s not like I’m risking a spot on the corporate ladder or anything

I know that lactose intolerance becomes a thing when we age.  I've told my husband this.

But he's never done anything to avoid milk.  I'll make almond milk and even though he says he likes it he doesn't use it for cereal or drink it fast enough before it goes off.  

But today was the day of reckoning!!!

Yesterday, he had 3 cups of coffee with milk, a big bowl of cereal, chocolate cake with a big glass of milk, and an activia yogurt for gut health.  After destroying the bathroom no less than 3 times this morning, he asked me about lactose pills and where to get them.  Then took off to deal with insane Saturday crowds at Costco to get his 180 count bottle of pills so he doesn't have to give up his milk.

Friends say im chapstick femme or soft masc and i feel like it fits enough. Not really too wrapped up in the labels.

I'm attracted to other masc leaning women so if that sounds like you, hi hello how are you.

For work i do puppetry and animation and write music for animated films and theatre productions so im not a huge homebody who likes vegging out in front of a tv cuz my brain just wants to analyze all of it and associates everything tv related w work. I do write books and am debating letting a professor friend publish one, but i'm hesitant to be in the hot seat of any type of fame or notoriety that coukd potentially come from that type of success, so my books mainly collect dust on my hard drive.

For fun i do archery, ride horses, rock climb, watch lecture series from universities freebies on youtube (i'm especially fond of Sarpolsky and christian christiansen), watch documentaries about animals (esp mesolithic species), geodes, prehistoric geology, cryptids, pbysics phenomena, and art. I like to read and be in nature and am slowly learning greek and chinese. I enjoy acadaemia greatly but i dont want to make a living off it and have the joy run dry. <non scholae. Sed vitae duscimus> i do adore the classics but feel them no more true and less archaic than any other religious fable.

I also make my own clothes so anyone who enjoys crafting would be cool. Illustration buddies to keep to our projects would be appreciated. Taxidermy pals, sound equipment nerds, oddity lovers of all types. Others who are obsessed w micro niches of music who want to pass playlists back and forth. All of the hyperfixations please attack me w them.

I'm financially modest and have no intention to become particularly materialistic, even if fate allows. I dont find that lifestyle especially comfortable. I do want to marry and have kids at some point in my life but right now i think prioritizing my academics is gonna continue to take precedent for the time being. 

I definitely would like a serious relationship but its hard to find women i'm attracted to who are also attracted to me who arent long distance and that can put a bit of a stall in that side of development (which i am honestly okay with). That said, if youre looking for friends or a flirtationship w the openness for it to be something sincere as we adjust to and get to know each other do please let me know. My DMs are open.

Cons: i play christmas music in spring, i dont believe in any judeo christian gods, i dont want a house full of many many cats, i do genuinely think it sounds far more appealing to get married by an elvis impersonator or a storm trooper than have some lavish, traditional, buckled up wedding. Ive never sat through star wars nor star trek. I dont care about anyones astrology signs and think your harry potter house or how you order your coffee says far more about you than any stardust ever could.

Latest chapter: Chapter 7 >
The day before my wedding to my childhood betrothed, I hid in the bridal suite, eager to surprise him. Instead, I was the one blindsided by the bombshell of his secret marriage. 'Three days ago, I tied the knot with Birdie Garcia at the courthouse,' Eli announced, puffing out his chest like a peacock. His buddies applauded his boldness. 'Eli, you sly dog, making moves without telling anyone. Why bother with this big wedding? Does Arabella know?' Eli adjusted his Rolex with a smirk that could cut glass. 'Even if she knows, so what? She was practically begging for this wedding anyway.' 'I’ve made a deal with Birdie. Arabella can have the public title of wife, but at home, she’ll be our maid, waiting on us hand and foot,' he said with a self-satisfied grin. 'You can’t have it all, right?' Standing outside the room, my hands trembled as I clutched the flute of sparkling water. So this was why Eli had rushed the wedding date. A bitter laugh escaped my lips as I tuned out their revolting chatter and dialed a familiar number: 'Sincere, I’m calling off the wedding.' ... 'Arabella, what the hell are you doing here?!' Eli’s face registered shock when the door swung open, quickly replaced by irritation. But when I pulled off my headphones, his annoyance flared up again. 'Didn’t I tell you we shouldn’t see each other before the wedding? Why can’t you follow simple instructions?' Eli carelessly shrugged off his jacket, letting it drop to the floor. The cigarette dangling from his fingers stayed lit as he plopped down beside me, blowing smoke directly into my face. Watching me cough violently, Eli’s lips twisted into a smug grin. 'You’re way more entertaining like this.' Between hacking coughs, I felt a surge of helplessness. The man I’d loved for years was unraveling before my eyes—this was the bitter truth. 'Go make me a coffee,' Eli commanded, lounging on the bed and gesturing lazily toward the kitchen. For the first time, I refused. Instead, I yanked open the curtains, letting a gust of cool air flood the room. 'I’m not your maid. If you want something, get it yourself.' Eli’s face darkened, but his scowl softened when he spotted the glass of sparkling water I’d set aside earlier, a smirk creeping back. 'What’s with the attitude? Playing hard to get now?' The sound of shattering glass cut through his taunt, the dark liquid splattering across his designer suit. Eli’s eyes narrowed in fury. 'Arabella, have I been spoiling you too much lately? Do you think marrying me gives you free rein?' 'Do you really think even if we get married, I won’t divorce you?' Meeting Eli’s scornful glare, I replied calmly, 'I believe you.' My uncharacteristic defiance threw him off guard. I’d never stood up to him like this before. In the past, even the slightest hint of a threat would send me scrambling to apologize, regardless of who was at fault. I thought I knew him, treating him like a perpetual teenager, always indulging his whims. Sometimes I wondered if I’d pushed too hard, making Eli treat me with such contempt. But now, none of it mattered anymore. I kicked aside the jacket Eli had tossed at my feet as a text notification reminded me to finalize the wedding details. Jadiel, surprisingly accommodating, deserved my thanks. After all, my family had initially intended for me to marry Jadiel, but my own foolishness had led me to Eli. As I turned to leave, Eli grabbed my wrist, rubbing his tired eyes. 'I know I’ve been distant lately, but there’s no need to blow up over words.' 'We have a wedding tomorrow. Go home and get some rest, okay?' I shook off his hand without a word. Just then, a familiar figure appeared at the door. Birdie, clad in the wedding dress I’d reserved just days ago, looked slightly uncomfortable seeing me there. Yet her perfectly made-up face radiated confidence as she staked her claim. I spun around in disbelief, glaring at Eli, who showed no remorse. 'Tomorrow morning, Birdie will be the bride.' ... I couldn’t believe Eli would stoop so low. Even if he didn’t love me, he shouldn’t humiliate my family like this. As his supposed fiancée, he’d allowed others to mock me, turning me into a laughingstock. I stared at Eli’s indifferent face with a mix of disappointment and disgust. 'Eli, you’ve lost your mind.' Knowing he was in the wrong, Eli awkwardly scratched his nose, trying to justify himself. 'Arabella, Birdie came to Brighton to be with me all these years. You know that. She just wants her parents to feel at ease, so she asked me to have the ceremony with her. It’s just one wedding—don’t overthink it. Just make sure your family doesn’t show up in the morning, okay?' I let out a cold laugh. Of course, he was asking for a favor—that’s why Eli was being unusually pleasant. I opened my mouth but decided against spilling the bitterness in my heart. None of it mattered anymore. Maybe my calm demeanor unnerved him, because Eli pursed his lips and promised, 'Don’t worry. I’ll behave at the evening reception.' In the past, this would’ve been enough to make me swallow my pride and return to his side with a smile. But now, I simply gave him a blank stare. Eli didn’t get it. Just as he reached out to pull me closer for more explanations, Birdie flung herself into his arms. Her eyes were slightly red, her voice trembling as she sobbed into his chest, 'I’m sorry, Eli, for causing trouble. My family wanted to see our home, so I might have to stay here tonight, and...' At that point, Birdie peeked up at me from Eli’s shoulder, her eyes daring me to challenge her. 'I’m afraid you’ll have to pack up your things, Arabella.' The defiance in her eyes almost made me laugh. They were already legally married, yet they kept up this charade in front of me. The gown was on, and they called it a pretense? Clearly, they intended to play house tonight. But that was fine. I didn’t want to leave a single trace of myself behind. 'Arabella, please...' Eli started, but I cut him off with a dismissive wave. 'Burn it all. I don’t care.' Without looking back, I walked out. As I left, Eli felt an unfamiliar pang in his chest, a nagging sense that something was slipping beyond his control.

Chapter 2
The conversation with Jadiel went surprisingly smooth—he had every detail mapped out, even remembering my favorite flowers. But then it hit me: I’d left my ID behind. I had to hail a cab back to my apartment, bracing myself for whatever awaited me there.
When I stepped inside, the place looked like it had been turned upside down overnight. My things were haphazardly stuffed into a cardboard box by the door, mixed with what looked like trash. From the living room, Birdie’s laughter bubbled out. She was draped in a flamboyant Victorian gown, and Eli stood beside her, enduring Freya and Kieran’s snide remarks with a forced smile. 
In that moment, everything felt hollow. The confident, magnetic guy I once knew had shrunk into a shadow around Birdie, just another face in the crowd. 
I crouched to grab my ID, and suddenly, Eli was there, gripping my wrist and pulling me into the hallway. “Arabella,” he murmured, his voice low, “we agreed you wouldn’t cause a scene, right?”
I wasn’t in the mood for this. I just held up the ID I’d retrieved and gave him a blank stare. His frown deepened; he’d noticed the shift in me since last night. “Arabella, we had a deal, didn’t we? You’re not thinking of skipping the wedding, are you?”
A deal? With Birdie in the morning and me in the afternoon? Did he seriously think he was some kind of king picking his queens?
I yanked my wrist free and flashed him a polite smile. “Of course not.”
Before I could say more, Birdie’s cheerful voice cut through the tension. “Arabella?” She and her entourage appeared at the doorway, their eyes scanning me with thinly veiled judgment. Eli’s expression turned grim, ready to whisper some threat, but I turned away with a smile and walked straight toward them.
Ignoring Eli’s stunned look, I offered a few perfunctory congratulations. Before I left, I made a point of grabbing the box of my so-called “trash” and, in front of everyone, dumped it into the garbage bin. Inside were the paintings I’d made of Eli over the years, each stroke once filled with affection. Now, staring at the cracked paint, all I saw was his face—a mask slowly peeling away, leaving me feeling sick to my stomach.
Birdie clung to Eli’s arm like she was bidding me farewell, playing the perfect hostess. My phone buzzed—a text from Eli begging me not to be upset, promising he’d be at the wedding that afternoon.
But the truth was, I wasn’t upset anymore. I smiled serenely and waved at Birdie’s smug expression. After all, by the afternoon, she’d be calling me Aunt Arabella.",2,1757193640.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1nab5wg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nab5wg,I was struggling with writing my next blog post until I got the idea of developing an addictive writing platform that I called WriteFlow,"So I've been putting off writing blog posts forever and tried that Cold Turkey Writer app everyone talks about. And it's a bit too aggressive for me. The interface is very white and not very helpful for long writing session.

Got annoyed and spent my weekend building WriteFlow instead.

* Settings get locked once you start writing so you can't procrastinate by tweaking stuff
* You can set word count goals OR timer goals
* Has this ""redact mode"" that blurs your text so you stop obsessing over editing
* Disables backspace if you want (flow state thing)
* Explodes confetti everywhere when you hit your goal

The psychology behind it is pretty simple: positive reinforcement instead of making you feel like shit for not writing enough. The confetti thing is stupid but it actually works? Like I genuinely look forward to writing now just to see the little particles.

Best part is the settings lock. Once you start a session you literally cannot mess with the settings until you hit your word count. Forces you to actually write instead of endlessly tweaking things.

Here is the [github](https://github.com/fberrez/writeflow) and the [live demo](https://writeflow-production.up.railway.app/)",22,1757193639.0,webdev,2,0.92,False

I recently got my first roaster - I’ve worked in speciality coffee for over ten years now but this is my first real taste of roasting. 

I’m having difficulty finding the same learning resources I’ve used throughout my commercial coffee production career and am therefore turning to Reddit in search of answers as I traverse this new region of coffee! 

My first question is this: 

Should I use lower charge/BT/ET/heat/airflow when roasting small doses (I’m talking 150-350g) than would be used in a commercial sized dose? 

Apologies if this is a silly question and/or if some of my terminology is incorrect!

Since my appetite is so low, eating feels like a chore. So when I have to eat I only choose highly palatable foods that also happen to be calorie dense (e.g. fast food, over-processed packaged foods, fried foods, heavy dressings/oils, etc). Basically all the high cal foods that are designed to be tasty and addictive. Nothing else tastes okay to me. I even hate coffee and I used to drink 3 cups a day!

As a result I’ve gained a tad bit of weight instead of losing lbs, because of course now I’m inadvertently eating more calories. I’m already on the lowest possible therapeutic dose. I thought my food aversion would get better over time as my body gets used to the dose. But 9 weeks in and no change… I’m wondering maybe this is not the med for me? What do you all think?

I yanked my wrist free and flashed him a polite smile. “Of course not.”
Before I could say more, Birdie’s cheerful voice cut through the tension. “Arabella?” She and her entourage appeared at the doorway, their eyes scanning me with thinly veiled judgment. Eli’s expression turned grim, ready to whisper some threat, but I turned away with a smile and walked straight toward them.
Ignoring Eli’s stunned look, I offered a few perfunctory congratulations. Before I left, I made a point of grabbing the box of my so-called “trash” and, in front of everyone, dumped it into the garbage bin. Inside were the paintings I’d made of Eli over the years, each stroke once filled with affection. Now, staring at the cracked paint, all I saw was his face—a mask slowly peeling away, leaving me feeling sick to my stomach.
Birdie clung to Eli’s arm like she was bidding me farewell, playing the perfect hostess. My phone buzzed—a text from Eli begging me not to be upset, promising he’d be at the wedding that afternoon.
But the truth was, I wasn’t upset anymore. I smiled serenely and waved at Birdie’s smug expression. After all, by the afternoon, she’d be calling me Aunt Arabella.",1,1757193509.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

* prepare photocopies of your OR, CR, ID, deed of sale (if nakuha 2nd hand) in advance. Mahirap magpa-photocopy sa loob ng mall. Sinacrifice ko ung paper/laminated copy ko ng National ID kasi di ako nakapagdala ng xerox ng ID at mahirap magpa-photocopy kasi queueing. Buti meron na ako na PVC version so I'd be ok na sakripisyo ko nalang un. Di sila sanay sa back to back so I had to explain several times na ung OR ko nasa likod ng CR and vice versa.
* Pumila ng maaga. Mas mahaba pila sa loob. If you need to leave to go to the CR or get food/coffee, pwede makiusap pero wag abusuhin. Bigayan nalang din kayo kasi mahaba-haba ang hintayan.
* Bring something to entertain yourself while waiting in line, aside from your phone. Mauubusan kayo ng battery sa kaka doomscrolling. I had a 3DS pero naubusan din ako ng battery ng phone.
* Check LTOTracker with them before committing. Also, your temporary plate is not your actual plate. Use MV number and not the 13XXX number. I think may mga iba pinaalis kasi in production na plate nila at ayaw na pakialaman nila at a certain stage. Secure a place in line first, then check with the front desk about the status of your plate in LTOTracker if makakuha ka sa loob. Ung status ko sa LTOtracker di pa ako na-assign ng kahit ano.
* 3 step process. Registration (dito ung mahabang pila), validation (tatawagin kayo ulit para magpresenta ng mga IDs or tanungin sayo tungkol sa sinubmit mo), and releasing. Wala na pila after sa 1st stage pero maging alisto nalang kung tatawagan pangalan mo. Mas maigsi hintayan between 1st and 2nd vs 2nd and 3rd pero matagal parin sya.
* You will receive your plate along with your certification na ipapasa sa registration. Need daw ipa-photocopy ung certification after but no need to do it immediately. Hirap magpa-photocopy sa mall. Sa labas ka nalang kinabukasan.
* Wala sya kasamang RFID Sticker. Not sure if after registration or cancelled na requirements na nun.

Not sure if meron pa LTO Caravan after and sa mismong mga LTO offices na sya moving forward:

1naaoq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1naaoq7/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Obsessed with coffee, likes to craft, is often studying in her room. She is usually up for a spontaneous adventure (last weekend we went mushroom foraging on a whim). A very contentious, thoughtful roommate with a great sense of humor who is also almost always in a good mood. 

Fur Babies:

• Maybe: A small, sweet, very well behaved lab/mini shepherd mix who loves everyone & will always be happy to see you when you come home. Doesn't bark much, doesn't destroy things or go potty in the house, is basically the perfect dog everyone loves <3

It was the fifth morning since the sky changed colors.

Not dramatically, not in a way that would halt traffic or anchor a news cycle. But subtly, like a bruise beneath the clouds. Bobby noticed it while he was brushing his teeth, how the blue sky now leaned a little green, like a drop of algae in a glass of milk. The weather channels said it was pollen. The President said it was not a concern. And the Secretary said nothing at all.

He could still see it as he stared out the kitchen window, mug in hand, the tea inside gone cold. He wasn't a coffee man. Too many toxins. The voice in his head agreed. The voice always agreed. It had for years now.

Ellen rustled the paper behind him, ""You're on the front page again.” Of course he was. First the rallies, then the debates, then the strange backroom deal that got him where he was now. Secretary of Health. A Winthrop. The prodigal son of a family that once made America feel clean. He still spoke like a reformer. Like a man allergic to lies. But lately the voice was helping write his speeches. It whispered clean science words turned inside out. It reminded him that people die every day and that maybe, just maybe, that was natural.

He looked at the green sky again. The voice hummed in his temple, a purr of certainty. ""*...mmm. Another fine morning, Bobby.*""

He remembered the first time it had spoken clearly. 2016. After the town hall in Akron, when the audience booed him for comparing fluoride to arsenic. He’d sat alone in the hotel bathroom, tie loose, palms trembling. The voice had come then, like someone adjusting the heat inside his skull: “…*They laughed at Galileo too…*”

That had calmed him.

Back then, it was occasional. A murmur amidst self-doubt. A steadying hand on the wheel. Now, it was always there. Adjusting inflection. Smoothing his vowels. Choosing which data to ignore and which to latch on to. He stayed strong at first, opposing it. But eventually, time exhausts all. Even the walls of Jericho came tumbling down.

And this morning, it purred. He didn't flinch anymore. He only smiled, and reached for the razor.

The briefing room was swamped. Bobby was too preoccupied with the razor burn along his neck to peruse, let alone notice, the packet that lay before his and every other seat in the flooded room. He hadn’t had razor burn since he was in high school. Then again, it was hard to find an aftershave free of isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, and menthol. Let alone Yellow 5 or Blue 1. But, as they say, a healthier tomorrow starts today.

A woman stood at the front of the room clicking through slides. Dr. Bellamy, CDC. Her voice was calm in the way radio static is calm: unrelenting. “…clusters in Indiana, Utah, Pennsylvania, parts of West Texas. We’re seeing consistent patterns of delayed motor response. Eye tracking loss. Slurred speech. Behavioral flattening… We believe we’re looking at a novel neuro-inflammatory disorder.”

The phrase clunked across the room like fog. Bobby watched it pass, felt it gather in the corners behind people’s ears and in the folds of their suits. He blinked. “Sounds like a tantrum.”

Bellamy paused. “Excuse me, Secretary?”

“Just thinking aloud.” He rubbed his neck and the click of her remote resumed.

Paper packets fanned out like autopsy reports. Charts. Maps. Dotted grids of numbers that meant nothing until they did. Bobby took a sip from the metal tumbler at his side. The water warm and gray. Like it had been boiled in copper pipes and forgotten.

“Now, this isn’t regression,” Bellamy said. “It’s active deterioration. These children don’t forget. They stop.”

Bobby smiled, vaguely. “Maybe it’s screens. Or sleep. Or posture. Hell! These kids carry backpacks like boulders and eat nothing but beige.”

“We’ll get ahead of it. We’re already drafting up public messaging. School guidelines, social hygiene, education on the available vaccine—”

Bobby raised a hand. “No. No slogans. No fear campaigns. Certainly not a vaccination crusade. Let’s not turn this into another apocalypse.”

“No one is calling this an epidemic,” Bellamy added. “Yet. Thankfully we have a course of action. The MP vaccine. Initially rolled out in the 60s, it has proven effective as a preventive measure against neurological disorders of this variety—”

Bobby raised another hand. “I thought this was a novel disorder?”

Bellamy didn’t flinch. She advanced the slide again. The next image was a graph of two clean lines. One flat. One climbing. “It’s novel in presentation but the underlying cause is familiar. The MP vaccine has been around for more than half a century. It was developed as a neurological safeguard. It wasn’t mandatory. Not then.” She took a measured breath. “But when the President publicly questioned its ingredients during the campaign and you, Secretary, cast doubt on its regulatory approval, parents listened. Uptake dropped by 70% in less than three months.”

The room went still. Bobby didn’t look up. He traced the condensation on his tumbler like it was a maze on the back of a kid’s menu.

“I’m not saying there’s a conspiracy here,” she went on, voice steady. “But there is hesitation. And that hesitation is killing children.”

Bobby didn’t flinch but something inside him writhed. “*…there it is… her little morality play. Thinks if she strings the words ‘children’ and ‘killing’ together, she wins the round…*”

He blinked slowly, watching her face for tremor. None. She believed every syllable she said. That was the problem.

“*…She doesn’t know what’s in it…*” the voice hissed. “*…Ask her the dosage. Ask her if she’s ever taken it herself. Ask her what else is in those vials besides false hope and feculence…*”

Bobby clenched his jaw until the muscles in his cheek fluttered. “Thank you, Doctor. You’ve made your point.”

Bellamy didn’t sit. She wasn’t going to.

“*…Sanctimonious corpse in a lab coat,*” the voice spat. “*…She’ll say anything for another term on the board. Ask her where her own kids go to school. Ask if their thermoses have ever been poisoned by—*” Bobby exhaled through his nose. Pinched the bridge of it between two fingers. He didn’t want to escalate. He didn’t want to mock. Not here. But he also didn’t trust her. Not because of the data. The data was clean. But because the purring voice had started sounding correct. Not persuasive. Just certain.

He looked back at the screen. Rows of charts. Faces blurred for privacy but still unmistakably young. “How old are these kids?” he asked.

Bellamy glanced at the packet. “Four to twelve, mostly. Some younger.”

“And they’re hospitalized?”

“Some. Others at home. All symptomatic.”

He stood slowly. His leg tensed, resisting him for half a second. “Well, I’d like to see them.”

“Secretary?”

“I want to go to the hospital. See how sick they really are.”

The fluorescent tubes of the hospital ceiling buzzed a sickly white flicker. Bobby marched through the hallway as a man on a mission from God. But not the God of mercy. No, this was the god of floods, of plagues, of righteous, smoking ruin. He passed rooms with names on the doors, like tombstones that hadn’t settled on a date. He stopped in front of a thin wall of plastic. The word QUARANTINE split by a floor-to-ceiling zipper in the center. His very own nylon rubicon. He scoffed and trudged through. The die was cast.

And then, a voice. Not the one he expected. One outside of him, quivering and young.  
“You’re not masked.” A nurse had appeared like a ghost through swinging doors, his eyes wide over fabric.

Bobby looked down. There it was. The mask, crumpled in his hand like a forgotten love letter. Bellamy stood behind him, masked. So did his aides, three of them, sterile behind N95s. He hadn’t noticed them fall in step. Hadn’t noticed much over the voice grinding its molars in his skull. He looked back at his hand, then back at him, blinking. As if someone else had made the decision not to wear it. He opened his mouth, dry, “I must’ve missed that part.” Bobby slipped it on like a dog collar. The elastic tugged at his ears. The voice huffed, “*…now you’re just playing along…*”

Past the threshold, past the burn of antiseptic reek, the air thickened. Like walking through soup. The room was lined with children. Not many. Four? Five? The number didn’t matter. What mattered was the quiet.

Not a single screen buzzed. Bobby had spent his fare share of time in the health circuit, visiting pediatric wards but this one was not like the rest. What should’ve been the sound of cartoons buzzing on televisions was instead replaced by quiet small breathing. And machines that tried their best to keep time.

The nurse ushered him to the smallest one. “This is Micah.” Bobby’s breath caught. In the bed was a little boy who appeared to be eight. Or used to be. Before his legs forgot what eight meant. Tubes ran from his face like some sort of eldritch altar. His fingers curled like drying petals.

Bobby nodded to something inside himself. “Clearly screen time,” he muttered. “All that blue light, it’s obscene.”

The nurse turned. “I beg your pardon?”

He cleared his throat. “Kids today. It was bound to happen. Always on their phones.”

The nurse stared at Bobby, jaw clenching. If he’d had swallowed any more words his tonsils would’ve gone along with them. “You can’t seriously be suggesting—”

Bellamy stepped forward, presenting a folder and a cooling misdirection. “You should see this, Secretary. It might clear some things up for you.”

“What am I looking at?” It was a photo. A long dirt road stretching out to a farmhouse.

Bellamy cleared her throat. “This was the first known case.” She looked at Bobby Winthrop as if it were sufficient enough of an answer for a man like him. For a moment she had forgotten she was working for a man like him.

He stared back at her, blinking for an answer. “Pennsylvania, Mr. Secretary. In an Amish community.”

The air stood as still as little Micah’s struggling lungs. Bobby’s eyes squinted at the image as if staring at it longer would transform it into something more palatable.

“So, you see, it can’t be screen time,” Bellamy added. “Secretary.”

“Yes! I know what Amish means, thank you very much.” Bobby pulled his mask back over his nose.

By the time they reached the car, the motorcade was already humming like an overused kazoo. “Washington?” Bellamy asked, already knowing the answer. 

Bobby nodded. “They’ll want me on camera.” His mind raced through a thousand addresses, hundreds of speeches, and just one question: Why me? He was no stranger to public scrutiny. Just two months prior his own sister had called him a fear-mongering conspiracy theorist to the loyal readers of *The Times*. But before Bobby could speculate on an answer to his quandary the voice lurched like a vulture on the interstate, “*…we have something to say…*”

It was a very quiet ride back to D.C. That’s what worried Bobby the most.

Those worries followed him all the way back to a large white building with too many cameras and not enough corners to hide in. As the motorcade turned onto Pennsylvania Avenue, the voice was beginning to stir. It didn’t speak in full sentences anymore. It didn’t have to. It fed him fragments, tangents, the static between radio stations. The worst of which, even Bobby flinched at.

The moment his shoes hit marble, Bobby asked for the restroom. No one questioned it. Secretaries and aides scurried like ants along picnic blankets. Everyone had somewhere to be and Bobby was expected to face the nation in less than fifteen minutes.

The restroom was tiled a sanitary white. The mirror above the sink was the kind that didn’t forgive. Every wrinkle, every blemish, every lie he’d swallowed reflected back in linoleum judgment. The kind of mirror that had watched dozens of men stand here and rehearse certainty.

Bobby tried to wash his hands but gave up halfway through. He reached into his pocket. A pair of tweezers he had grabbed on his way out of the hospital. He hadn’t given it much thought at the time. Self-preservation perhaps.

In ancient France, they carved into skulls to let the sickness out. Neolithic surgeons would grind into bone for hours until the cranial plate finally gave way. The goal was to release evil spirits festering beneath, or perhaps just the pressure of something unknowable and cruel. No anesthesia. No antiseptic. Just a stone tool and patience. Pain, as procedure.

History has a way of repeating itself. Not with bone dust and stone blades, but with whatever you can grab on your way out of the hospital. Bobby raised the forceps to his ear as if listening for a long distance call. But before he could leave a message after the tone, he plunged the tweezers into his ear, his face twisted at the initial shock. A faint squelch as metal entered flesh.

At first, there was nothing. Then, resistance. A twitch, barely perceptible. Like the snagged thread of a sweater. He pulled. And with the pulling, a pain. A nauseous, dizzying pain.

It started to give way. A cocktail of thick plasma and old wax congealed, creeping down his earlobe. He could feel something uncoiling from deep inside, a filament unwinding, slick and warm, like tendon peeled from bone. He twisted his grip the way a child twirls a fork of spaghetti. Finally, the length of something dark slid into view between the prongs of the tweezers. At first he thought it was a blood clot. Then it flexed. His breath caught. And it moved again. Not a reflex, rather a choice. A defiance. It was a worm. Long. Barbed. And very much alive. 

He stared at the length of it. Almost a foot long, and that was just the part he was able to unravel. There was no telling how much more of it had rooted itself, spiraling through every hollow and fold of his skull. It glistened in the bright, greasy and viscous. Something not meant to be witnessed in daylight. Tendrilous barbs gleamed, not unlike fishhooks. More like thorns. Only thorns do not move. Its entire skin seemed to contract hypnotically. Some kind of parasitic undulation, pulsing and wrenching.

It wasn’t long before Bobby noticed the smell. Oh, the smell. The acrid must emanating from within. Pungent enough to make him gag. But before bile could reach his uvula he yanked. Hard.

A white-hot shock of pain jolted down his leg. It went limp. His knees buckled. He braced the bathroom counter, but his hand slipped, slick with sweat and blood. His hip slammed into the granite as he fell, the tweezers clattering into the sink. Then, fast and sudden, the worm snapped free. It didn’t retreat so much as lash backward. He could hear the snapping of cartilage and the wet scraping of barbs against his inner ear like teeth on pavement. “*...that wasn’t very smart, Bobby…”*

He could no longer feel his toes. He was now using both hands to hold himself up, staring ahead at the only face he could. His own. It blinked. Just a flicker. Quick. Too quick to name. But it was there.

He opened his mouth. Closed it. The weight in his skull had shifted. Not gone. Just rearranged.

He didn’t remember leaving the bathroom. The next moment, he was being powdered. A new tie had been looped around his neck. Navy blue, like calm seas above a trench. The green light on the camera blinked at him like an impatient eye. The aide’s voice buzzed in the periphery. “Ten seconds, Mr. Secretary.”

He stood behind the podium. The prompter glowed the opening lines he had written for himself an hour before. His fingers gripped the podium like a man bracing for impact. He tried to swallow.

The worm spoke. Not aloud. Not yet. It pushed the words into his mouth like a ventriloquist guiding a wooden jaw. “*…Say it just like we rehearsed…*”

His lips moved.

“Good evening. I want to speak directly to the American people. Not as your Secretary of Health, but as a father, a neighbor, and a citizen of this great nation.

“In recent weeks, we’ve seen a rise in cases of what is being labelled as MLD-23. A so-called illness that appears primarily in children. I want to be clear: there is no need for panic. Yes, some children are coughing. Yes, a large number are currently on life support. And yes, tragically, a small number have passed. But I urge you to stay calm. We are coordinating with local governments, monitoring its progression, and assessing containment strategies.

“We are told this pathogen is new. But illness is not new. Suffering is not new. Children have always been the first to walk through fire. Let me ask you, when did we come to believe that health was a birthright? That breath was owed to us, and not earned? Some children will be taken. That is true. But let it be known: those who remain shall be tempered. Hardened. Unclouded by toxins and tinctures and the mercy of cowards.

“We are a great nation. We have braved far greater than a cold exercise and a diet could cure. There’s no vaccine for weakness. No antidote for being born soft. Let our bodies remember what it once was before the needle came. After all, we do not mourn the forest when the rot is cut from it. God bless you, and may we all emerge from this stronger, purer, and finally aware.”

1naai2p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1naai2p,Help me keep my furniture out from under leaking areas 😩,"I've got a unique challenge: over Christmas I'd saved up a bunch so I could redesign my weird little living space. The first two pictures are the original setup. It's a basement apartment that has two areas that have started to leak pretty badly: under the front door whenever it rains - I mean water POURING in - and from the neighbor's upstairs shower. It's a long story, and yes everyone is aware of what is going on, but the end result is it won’t fixed any time soon (it's complicated, don't ask, and unless I leave the state entirely I can't afford to move). While the leaks are currently not happening, there is no guarantee they will remain that way because in both cases the fixes are super temporary.

But now my living room is in shambles. I've taken everything apart and tried to rearrange it, but you can see by the photos this is not ideal. The big hole in the ceiling can't have anything underneath it, and neither can the front door, slightly to the right. The front storage cabinet used to be there, and the couch with a chez used to stretch from under the window to the space where the hole is.

I've already removed one chair and brought out one of the rugs so it doesn't get ruined. I have zero storage anywhere, so that's not an option. The couch is super modular, which is helpful, because it's really the only thing I am desperate to keep, but now it's just... we'll, a giant cube.

I need help.

The room is weirdly huge and a combination living room kitchen. I installed all the shelves in the kitchen left of the sink; under the window there is where all the glasses and such are kept.

From the door to the right corner is 53in. From the corner to the window is 34; from the window to the nook table is 124. In the other direction, from the door to the built in bookshelf is 33, from that corner to the hallway is 98in. The built in bookshelf itself is 33 wide.

The taller of the two storage cabinets is 33.5x43t, the cabinet with the record player is 47x37t. Each seat of the couch is 34x29, +6 for the arms and back,  and every piece is modular.

I've been thinking about ditching the coffee table for something smaller and round, moving the chair to put its back to the dining room table possibly. I host DnD at my place once a week so having more tablespace and seating was important to me but I don't know what to do now. You can ignore all the art and mirrors, all of that needs rearranging but I'm more concerned about the furniture at this stage.",1,1757191970.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

The ordering for your car then go into eat is awesome. No need to wait in line. The food is average and the beverages are all “off brand”. For example: no cocacola or pepsi. Just “cola”. Lots of coffee/matcha options though. 

Lots of cool indoor or outdoor seating where you can watch the movie their projecting. The staff there was excellent, they work really hard and keep it pristine.

1naagih,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1naagih,My grandparents old kitchen table,"My grandparents old kitchen table. Grandpa made it from spare parts or things he found and it was used for about 30 years, maybe longer. The chairs were made of some sort of ribbed vinyl with a strange pattern that didn't match the table at all.  This old thing reminds me so much of them.  All of the Christmas dinners, Christmas cookies, Thanksgivings, Easters, and gallons of chicken and dumplings were made on it.  The scratches from cutting the homemade noodles can still be seen.  It's been used for pinning and cutting clothing patterns, canning days, handmade Christmas decorations, art projects, coffee and gossip. It sat in the gallery kitchen and was pulled away from the wall under the sliding window probably thousands of times so my aunt and uncles could sit around it in the evening.  It was always meticulously wiped clean after every meal.  I remember being set in my highchair and being scooted over the asbestos tiles until the tray was close to the edge of the table.  When I was about three I would sit on Grandpa's lap while he had breakfast. He dipped toast in fried egg yolks and gave me a piece at a time.  It was where Grandma sat me down to play with a tabletop organ, somehow enduring the noise of random keys being pushed and making no kind of musical sense.  It was on this table while playing with that organ that I first discovered that a metal fork being pushed down between the keys would give me an unpleasant sensation in the front of my head and a smell I can still remember 48 years later. Now when I look fondly at this table, it reminds me of a huge piece of chopped ham and I can't help but smile thinking of all of the mismatched but carefully ordered things in my grandparents house.

1naa5l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1naa5l9/discover_if_the_sixthreezero_evryjourney_womens/,Discover if the Sixthreezero EVRYjourney Women's Cruiser Bike lives up to reviews!,"The sixthreezero EVRYjourney Women's Beach Cruiser Bike, Step-Through Touring Hybrid Bicycle arrived at my doorstep last month, and I've been using it almost daily since then. It's not just a mode of transportation; it became part of my daily routine, whether running errands, cruising by the beach, or commuting to work. Admittedly, I have a bit of a soft spot for beach cruiser bikes, but there’s something about this model that stands out from the many I’ve tested over the years.

**The Design and Ride Comfort**

This step-through bike boasts a swooping aluminum frame, which perfectly combines aesthetics and practicality. Its low-swooping frame not only enhances its visual appeal but also ensures effortless mounting and dismounting. The foot-forward seat position, a unique feature that promotes upright riding, makes it a more relaxed ride for my back and shoulders. Whether I had a jacket on or was wearing jeans, the setup worked seamlessly, accommodating quick stops with feet flat on the ground. I even lent it to my mom, who usually avoids bikes due to mounting struggles, and she found it surprisingly comfortable and accessible.

**Performance and Versatility**

Equipped with a Shimano 7-speed derailleur and handbrakes, it handled city roads, inclines, and longer rides with remarkable ease. Surprisingly, the bike performs well across different terrains, from neatly paved parks to slightly rugged trails. The 26-inch aluminum wheels paired with 2-inch semi-slick whitewall tires offer a smooth, cushioned ride, even during sudden turns or uneven paths. The responsive handbrakes caught me pleasantly off guard on my first ride, especially during quick stops.

[Check sixthreezero EVRYjourney Women's Beach Cruiser Bike price on Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b011a4hbtc/)

**Build Quality and Durability**

This bike strikes a balance between lightweight functionality and sturdiness. At approximately 38 pounds assembled, lifting it for storage isn’t overbearing, although I wouldn't call it featherlight either. The aluminum frame not only keeps it relatively lightweight but also resilient to wear and tear. The navy color with a brown leather seat and grips combination is timeless—it had both my friends and a stranger at the coffee shop showering compliments. Plus, the dual-spring seat design makes urban commuting or beach cruising close to luxury.

**Highlights**

- Rear rack provides additional utility for carrying baskets or small cargo.  
- The ergonomic leather-stitched grips and spring saddle ensure a comfortable grip and seating, even on longer journeys.  
- Fenders come in handy during the occasional beach drizzle, keeping debris and water off my clothes.  

**Areas of Concern**

Although this bike shines in many areas, not everything is perfect.  

- Assembly was a minor hurdle—it comes 80% pre-assembled, leaving some fine-tuning (gears and brakes, mostly) for the user. I eventually sought the help of a friendly neighbour with bike experience to get it just right.  
- The rigid suspension system, while suitable for city and light trails, isn’t ideal for bumpy off-road rides.  

**Challengers**

Comparing this cruiser to the Schwinn Mikko & Huron Cruiser Bike, it's evident they cater to fairly similar audiences. The Schwinn’s frame is equally stylish and functional with robust tires, but it doesn’t match the upright comfort of the sixthreezero EVRYjourney. I tested both simultaneously, and while the Schwinn seemed better suited for uninterrupted leisure strolls, it felt short on versatility that the 7-speed EVRYjourney delivers. On the higher end, Electra Townie has more premium components, yet its price tag doesn't necessarily add extra functional value over this hybrid.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

This hybrid definitely delivers serious bang for your buck, packing features that blend comfort, utility, and efficiency at an accessible price. Other bikes in this segment may offer one or two standout features, but few tie them together so cohesively as the sixthreezero EVRYjourney. From the design to the functionality, it feels like you’re getting more mileage than one might expect at this range.

so ive been using a Delonghi Dedica EC680.M for the last 7 years. I loved this machine since i picked it up back then for around 30€ 2nd hand and only had to replace the pump throughout the years. I also replaced the crappy milk steam thingy with a better one from a rancilio silvia. The espressos where always not very drinkable since they were way too bitter (therefore overextracted i guess) however, I always enjoyed drinking cappuccinos more and the milk masked the flawes of the shot really well and my cups always tasted really delightful and chocolaty to me.

But now i kinda wanted to finally get a new machine in hope i would get even better and more consistent shots out of it. I have a really tight budget which will propably get many of you in here riled up (around 150€) but since i got so much enjoyment out of my delonghi i was not that worried about getting a cheaper machine instead of a bambino or similar. Now on amazon i found this fairly new Neretva Espresso machine for around 160€ with few reviews as it has only been in sale their for around 2 month. The machine itself is pretty nice in my opinion and even has a little venting valve that releases the pressure after the shot into the drip tray to prevent dripping. The steam wand i nice as well despite the weird turning knob instead of a lever for the steam valve. Biggest flaw in the general design is that you cant reprogram the amount of water for the shots however the preset provides around enough water for a normal proper shot, however im not sure how the machine measures the water amount (i would guess by time since its the cheaper alternative). On the delonghi ive used a little scale to measure my output and just held the button down (water amount reprogram mode) and released it whenever i got the desired amount for every shot.

I also bought an open portafilter for it since it only comes with pressurized baskets. Now i was quickly disappointed since i just cant get a decent shot out of it. Im using a Baratza Sette 30 grinder and with the same setting i used for my delonghi (around 7ish on the dial) The machine just shoots up to 15 bars on the gauge and clogs up. One setting higher and the coffe is an underextracted mess and just shoots out freely. I also tried the old basket i used on the delonghi (also used an open porta filter and non pressurized basket on it) to rule out more variables. Im usually using 12g of beans for a double shot into 24g of espresso since more seems to overflow my baskets. For the first shot i pulled with the new machine i used 16g since that was the advertised amount for the basket of the portafilter i got but that was way too much coffe ground afterwards and i had to strip alot off to even be able to tamper it properly. After i use a WDT to even the grounds a little and break up clumps and then i tamp with a spring loaded tamper. Im also using a two sided puck screen which may also restrict the flow a bit. Then i just place my cup on a little scale and pull 24g of espresso. Now im wondering if it is my incompetence, the new machines fault (cant really see how since it just shoots hot water through ground coffee) or my grinder beeing inconsistent for some reason. I thought i had bought a quality one though :(. The pucks are always really wet with the new machine whereas with my delonghi they were fairly dry and only a little moist.",1,1757190969.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

“Read this!!!” 

I grew curious when I saw the name: Eli.

I wouldn’t have considered him someone I kept in touch with. So, it was strange to receive an email from him out of the blue. 

Still, I was intrigued. The last I heard about him was a screenshot I’d seen on a friend’s Instagram story, indicating he’d gotten his dream job. Lucky him. 

Eli was one of the smartest guys in our class, so I wasn’t surprised. 

His email sat at the top of my Gmail, with no subject, just a line of exclamation marks, which was very Eli.

*“Hey, Gabby, long time no see! Do you remember when we used to play visual novel games during study hall?”*

He started the email as if he were reminiscing at a high school reunion, though it was strangely comforting. 

I did remember. I was obsessed with visual novel games as a teenager.

The Persona games were a particular favorite.

I vaguely remember sitting in the library playing them until my friends had to physically drag me away from my PSP. 

However, I didn’t recall Eli being with me.

It was always just me or my close circle of friends. 

*“Well, I currently work as a game designer at an indie company, and I figured you might like this! It’s our newest project, and it’s still in early development, though the game itself and the story are finished!”*

*”Why don’t you check it out before it goes live on Steam early next year?”*

*”We’re trying to send early access to some well-known streamers, but it’s taking a while :) If I remember correctly, you’re into this sort of thing, right? Neverwood is completely up your alley.”*

Underneath the initial paragraph was a link, and intrigued, I clicked on it. 

Another window—what looked like a download wizard—came up.

*“Let me know what you think! I spent two years on this game, so I would appreciate your feedback! If I had to describe it, I would say it’s Persona, but more slice-of-life lol. There’s a school setting, and it focuses on making attachments, so no superpowers ;)”*

I rolled my eyes at that. Eli hadn’t changed.

I loaded up the download wizard, which went through the specs I needed to play the game, and then the usual terms and conditions that I automatically skipped through. 

I could see some of the imagery in the background. 

It was a window looking out into a sky filled with stars and a crescent moon. 

I don’t know why I expected something similar to Stardew Valley, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The art seemed to be hand-drawn, with no pixels in sight. It was cozy. 

It reminded me of Welcome to Nightvale. The game was easy to download. 

It took maybe five minutes of staring at a rapidly changing progress bar, skipping from 10% to 50% and then back to 3% before the game finally loaded up. 

It was surprisingly well-made.

The game started with an almost cinematic scene involving a first-person point of view of a car ride. 

There was no voice acting, only text boxes popping up in varying shades of purple which I thought was a nice touch. 

I was introduced to eighteen-year-old Maddy, a wallflower, returning home after a summer away at camp. 

Driving through an idealistic-looking town, the animation was smooth, with no glitches or lag. 

Neverwood unfolded in flashes, framed like a photographic collage, polaroids pinned to Maddie’s bedroom walls. I guessed these were all playable locations. 

A diner, a coffee shop, a school, each rendered in warm, inviting detail. 

The music hummed lo-fi, while other characters were introduced through cryptic texts and blurred silhouettes glowing in the late afternoon sun.

Maddy herself frowned at a photo of her with a guy, his face blocked by her finger. 

Whoever did the art for this game was talented. 

The smooth blending of colors with the interface made everything feel cozy and lived-in.

These characters looked real. Sure, they were hand-drawn sprites, clearly crafted with care, but they moved and acted like real people. The animation was flawless. 

Eli and his colleagues had clearly drawn inspiration from Life is Strange.

The game’s visuals immediately drew me in. Cyberpunk hues clashed with warm tones, vivid reds and purples blurred together in the vaporwave glow of traffic outside the car.

I picked up the story through Maddy’s narrative: a written monologue, snapshots of unread texts, missed phone calls. Senior year was her chance to finally try. 

She had friends but had never really invested in them, always backing out or making excuses.

The animation ended with her lying in bed, decorated in a nostalgic, almost mournful way, a nod to a teen who had lost much of her late adolescence to a virus. 

Maddy gazed at the sky, wishing she could see the stars for real, longing to stargaze with the friends she had pushed away. 

Then a notification popped up on her phone, from one of the blurry faces in the polaroid montage. 

A heart emoji blinked next to his name.

*“You up?”*

The text box reflected her thoughts as the interface lit up. 

I had to click on something glowing behind her, a photograph. This time, I saw the face: a smiling brunette with freckles. 

Penn. 

The art was beautiful, even for secondary characters. The care in making him feel real and relatable was evident.

The guy’s personality was clear through pictures on the wall: hockey team, true crime fan, usually behind the camera in Maddy’s snapshots. 

The game required scrolling through the texts between them, mostly Penn trying and failing to get her to hang out. 

These two were childhood friends destined to be together, at least according to their moms’ friendship. I found myself drawn to both the game and their relationship. 

Other characters emerged as I navigated the tutorial and explored town. There was something undeniably compelling about the childhood-friends-to-lovers trope.

The tutorial explained the objectives: make as many friends as possible, build a relationship with your chosen character, and solve a mini-mystery. Who had given the entire senior class food poisoning?

My options were clear:

Penn, the childhood best friend the game subtly nudged me toward. He showed up at her door with breakfast cupcakes, asking if she wanted a ride to school.

Then there was Violet, a wannabe reporter in Maddy’s class investigating the food-poisoning incident. 

And Jude, the estranged friend working at the coffee shop, fluent in sarcasm. 

If you approached the counter immediately, his sprite wouldn’t appear right away. 

When he finally did, coffee in hand, the text read:

""Aren’t you tired of stalking me?""

Click on him too many times, and he would vanish entirely, becoming an NPC until you left the area. 

I assumed this was a glitch and waited until school the next morning to ask him about it.

I admit, I got hooked. I ended up building relationships with all three, indecisive about who Maddy should end up with. 

Solving the mystery was straightforward. One of the football players had been playing a prank.

I spent a whole real-time night sneaking around the school with Violet, learning more about her story. 

She and Maddy had fought at the start of summer, Maddy went to camp and left Violet on read. The game hinted they might have had a closer relationship, their falling out tangled with Violet’s family drama.

Violet didn’t fully reveal their story until we had solved the food poisoning mystery. 

Yes, they were a thing and yes, just as I thought, Violet’s family wasn’t exactly supportive. So, my main character was bisexual and in love with her best friend. 

I got an award for solving the mystery in record time, and Violet gave me a present, a bag of diamonds I could spend at the mall, though I couldn’t interact with it yet.

After solving the mystery with Violet and playing a pretty fun mini-game that involved catching the culprit by throwing watermelons at him, the game took me back to the school, where I presumed the next part of the story would begin. 

I had been playing non-stop for two days, only pausing for work and eating. 

So, I took a break.

I searched for the game online, but there was no mention of it.

Curious, I went on Twitch to see if Eli had managed to convince some streamers to play it, but no such luck. 

Last night, I had several hours to kill, so I hopped back onto Neverwood. 

Penn jumped straight at me the second I loaded back to my last save point, which was outside the school. 

His sprite was slightly bigger than usual, overlapping the text box at the bottom of the screen.

“Where did you go?” Penn folded his arms. “Maddy, I’ve been waiting for you. We were supposed to go to the movies.”

Were we?

I had to think back, feeling a little disoriented and foggy-brained from work.

Oh, yeah, I had movie tickets in my inventory. 

I picked them up behind a trash can in the town square, only to get a snide comment from Jude, who was standing several feet away. 

I was kind of out of it when I played through his character’s story, but basically, he had drifted from the friend group when his mom got diagnosed with cancer and pushed them all away. 

Jude admitted he regretted it, and he and Maddy shared a hug—which I thought was cute. 

I figured Jude’s character would be easier to talk to and more aligned with the main story instead of being thrown to the side, but apparently not.

His comment confused me. I think it was one of the reasons I decided to take a break. 

*“You’re not supposed to be here,”* his character said, and he kept repeating it every time I clicked on him for answers.

In my haste to take a break from the game and these characters, I had completely forgotten about the movie tickets.

I had three options to choose from to answer him:

**Oops, sorry! I totally forgot!**

**Yeah, I’m not really in the mood for the movies. How about a rain check?**

**I hear they’re playing that new superhero movie! We should go see it!**

I picked the third option, and the two of them wandered into the movie theater. 

I didn’t see what went on inside; it just came up with: **“Penn and I had a great time watching Monster Sequel 2!”**

I expected Penn’s character story to start after that, and it did. Kind of. I was drip-fed information about his and Maddy’s past, as well as his rocky friendship with Jude. 

But just as the game started getting into the meat of his story, and I was getting invested in their friendship, Penn’s sprite contorted suddenly, before he… *blinked.* 

If I had been focusing on the text box, I wouldn’t have noticed. 

Instead, I was stupidly counting the number of freckles on his cheek. 

I don’t think I’ve ever experienced something as uncanny and strange as a video game character suddenly blinking out of nowhere. 

It wasn’t the usual blink of a character animation, which I was used to.

It was a slow blink. 

The rapid-flowing text stopped.

""... ""

I frowned at my options at the bottom, which involved sympathizing with him over his and Jude’s friendship breakup. 

Then his sprite flashed out of existence, leaving me alone outside the movie theater. 

The game seemed to continue as normal.

**""You had a great conversation with Penn!""** the text box popped up.

**""Why don’t you call him and ask for a second date?""**

The cellphone icon at the top of the screen was flashing, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. 

Now, I was playing at midnight. I don’t think these glitches would have affected me as much if I’d been playing during the day. 

I headed to the school to see if I could find someone to talk to, but once my character popped up in the main hallway, the lo-fi music in the background stopped.

I thought it was the game itself, but when I clicked on a locker to pick up a bag of diamonds, the sound effect of the locker opening and closing was still there.

At this point, I was considering restarting the game, but I found myself hovering my cursor over the classroom doors I could interact with.

The main classroom, where most of the story had taken place, was usually unplayable during character stories, and I was pretty sure I was playing Penn’s. 

Still, when I clicked on it, I was let in. The classroom popped up as usual, and I had apparently walked into a conversation I didn’t start. 

Violet, Penn, and Jude’s default sprites were already on the screen. 

Penn seemed to be the main speaker, with his text box flashing up every few seconds, but his words were going too fast for me to read. 

His usual expression was a warm smile, but this time the boy was scowling.

Meanwhile, Jude and Violet looked... amused.

I was sure I had never seen Jude smile or even smirk before. 

He always looked annoyed, while Violet’s smile was always cheery, sometimes flashing a heart with her hands.

These expressions were different, though I couldn’t explain why. 

These fictional characters weren’t real, and yet somehow, they were so much more expressive in this classroom, their lips curled with amusement, eyes shining.

The two of them appeared to be listening to Penn’s rant, which was getting progressively harder to make out.

So, I took a screenshot and managed to capture at least part of it:

“Why can’t you just LISTEN TO ME?”

His sprite was going crazy, expressions flickering from happy to sad to annoyed.

I took another screenshot, though this one was kind of blurry: “The SAME day OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AREN’T YOU TIRED? VIOLET, YOU—”

I could feel my stomach twisting into knots.

“—SO MANY TIMES, AND IT’S LIKE WE’RE STUCK. WE’RE STUCK RELIVING THIS SAME DAY, THIS SAME WEEK, THIS SAME YEAR, AND I’M SCARED BECAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. LIKE I’M CRAZY. AND I’M NOT [FUCKING] CRAZY, I’M TELLING YOU WE—”

I stopped taking snapshots when the text stopped flowing. This time, Penn’s sprite turned directly toward me, and I saw it. 

I saw his expression twist into disgust, his lip curling. It was so human, so normal, like I was staring at a living, breathing person through that animation. I almost closed the laptop, but part of me wanted him to continue.

“What the [FUCK] are you doing here?”

His curse words appeared in bolded gibberish I could just make out.

Penn’s sprite overlapped the text again. “Shouldn’t you be playing mini-games?” he said. “Leave.” The character told me.

Me.

Not Maddy, the game’s protagonist.

Me.

The player.

I had no way to communicate back because there was no option. As I stared stupidly at my screen, he turned back to the others.

“Please.” The text popped up again, and his eyes were suddenly far too human, too haunted. “I know I sound crazy.”

“Yeahhhh.” Jude’s sprite appeared mid-eye-roll. This time, he wore his coffee shop apron, which was either a glitch or something else. Just like Penn, he was more expressive than usual, smiling more than I had ever seen.

“What exactly are you trying to tell us?”

“You heard him.” Violet’s sprite was grinning. “He says we’re video game characters! Which is a good one!”

She turned to look directly at me, her head cocking to the side in one swift burst of animation. “Sooo, that would mean every choice I make is someone else’s?”

The desk next to her suddenly flipped over, and her smile widened. “False! Because I just used my own free will to kick that desk over. So, in conclusion, Penn is, like, totally losing his mind, and we should get him to the town doctor.”

“Agreed.” Jude’s sprite had frozen mid-eye-roll, which shouldn’t have freaked me out as much as it did. “I knew he was going to lose it at some point, but not in high school. Maybe he hit his head.""

Penn’s expression crumpled. “Jude, wait–”

""Later."" Jude's sprite waved. 

The two of them left the classroom, and I snapped out of my trance, starting to close my laptop, my head spinning.

Eli was… quite the designer.

If he could create a game as meta as this, he was definitely going to make it in the industry. I was sure Neverwood would be a success. 

However, I definitely was not a fan of the fourth-wall breaking. 

The whole thing freaked me out. There was uncanny valley, and then there was fourth-wall breaking. Fictional characters acknowledging your existence was… something else.

I was ready to exit the game when Penn’s sprite jumped over the text box.

“Hey!”

His sprite got uncomfortably close. “Don't leave me.”

The text flashed up, and I couldn’t look at his face because I could almost trick myself into believing it was a real person speaking to me. 

The mix of agony and confusion in his eyes was too human, too real. 

“I know you want to quit, and I can understand that I’m freaking you out,” 

His text appeared a little slower, and I could imagine a real person taking deep breaths through ellipses. 

“I don’t know why I’m the only one who thinks this way.""

""I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t aware of what was happening.""

""I’ve solved the mystery at our school countless times. I’ve gone on endless dates with the main character, and they always play out exactly the same.”

I was surprised by his *face-palm* animation. 

“I come to school, and I go home, and it doesn’t feel like living when I’m awake.” 

His sprite ducked his head, and something warm slid up my throat. 

“It’s torture. I don’t want to be awake anymore. I don’t want to be aware of this existence because this existence…?” 

The text box was empty for a moment while he pondered his thoughts.

“It sucks, dude.” The text glitched again. “Why should I have to relive the same days? Why should I have to be forced to count each reset? I’m alone. It's just me going crazy  on my own. I know video game characters don’t usually have a say in what they’re allowed to do. Their entire life is controlled by the player.” 

His expression became subtly dark. 

“And I think that’s a pretty shitty existence. I should be allowed to make my own choices.""

.... 

""Who I want to be friends with, who I want to love, who I want to hate, and how I’m going to live my life.""

...

""Like I said, it’s not fair. Being aware of my existence and even giving me the ability to think for myself is twisted.” 

His sprite shrugged. 

“So, you can go right ahead.”

When I didn’t respond, because I had no way to talk to him, he continued.

“There’s a separate folder with the game files,” Penn said. “I’m not allowed inside them, so I can only see a list of names and notes.”

I knew what he was talking about the second he mentioned the list of names.

How could I deny this thing… this living thing an end?

But also, wasn’t this murder? If this game had fictional characters with consciousness, wouldn’t I be killing someone?

“It’s easy to delete me,” Penn said. “Just right-click and delete.”

His smile made me feel sick.

“I know it’s kind of barbaric, but trust me, you would be doing me a favor.”

I noticed the classroom glitching around him, and I wondered if him being awake and controlling the game was messing with the controls. 

I got my answer when I tried to open the options screen, and half of the screen froze. Luckily, it didn’t affect Penn, who easily popped up over the frozen interface. 

“You’re not killing me,” he said. “You’re saving me. It's just like going to sleep, right? I won't even know I'm sleeping.” 

His words somehow navigated me to the game files, and just like he had described, there was a list of folders with one containing the names of the characters. 

I went back to the game’s screen, and he was still there, and this time, he was smiling his default smile.

“I would say delete the others too, but I don’t think that’s my choice to make. Violet and Jude can make their own choice, and I respect whatever they  choose to do.” 

He paused, and I found myself teary-eyed, my gaze flicking through several text boxes with just “…” before he continued. “Did you know I can actually have dreams?”

I figured Penn knew I couldn’t reply, but he did his best to act like he could hear me. “Do you believe in reincarnation?”

I was hovering my cursor over his file when he continued. “I have dreams where I’m not in this town,” he said. 

“I’m someone else. I’m a whole different person with a different life—and I think that was my past one.”

His smile made me feel queasy and yet indescribably sad at the same time.

“So, that means I was human in my other life, right? This was just another life on top of all of the others I’ve had, and this is just….” He paused, the screen glitching once again. 

“This one life is just a blip where something went wrong. Maybe my next life will be better? I don’t just exist as a thing in this game, I’m actually real. I’ve been real—and when you delete me, I’ll...be real again.”

I saw the ellipses as his way of sighing.

Fuck. I was choked up over a sentient video game character.

I swiped at my eyes.

“So, yeah, you can do it now.” His sprite looked peaceful, and yet when I clicked on his name, I still felt like I was responsible for this thing’s death. “You know what’s weird?”

The message popped up when I was hovering over his name.

“Jude and Violet.” Penn’s expression contorted a little into confusion. His sprite changed to a crying animation. 

“Those dreams that I have? They’re in them too. Which is kinda crazy, right? Maybe it's fate.”

His last message was confusing. “I'll see you on Monday.”

I deleted him before he could finish and it wasn’t as climactic as I was expecting. 

Penn’s sprite disappeared, but his text box was still wavering on the screen. 

I could see the effects of his removal almost instantly, even if it was hard to notice at first. Maddy’s cell phone was glitching in and out of existence, and I could no longer click on the town map. 

I went back to Maddy’s bedroom, and the Polaroids with his face were gone, while some stray ones had a glitched-out version of his smile, which freaked me out.

I exited the main menu and was ready to stop playing, ready to purge this game from my mind, when I found myself back inside the character folder.

It’s weird. I could almost liken it to feeling like a god. 

The remaining names stood out in front of me. I should have clicked out of the game files, but something lingering in my gut, entwining its way through me, kept me there. 

Penn told me he didn’t have the right to delete the others from existence, but that was just him. 

This sentient thing had spoken like a living, breathing human being despite being nothing but code tangled together. 

He said it was torture to be awake and aware of his never-ending, monotonous existence.

Wasn’t that what it was like for them?

Even if they were not awake, there was a chance they could become aware at some point and be destined to the same fate as Penn.

He said he had relived the reset thousands of times.

And I couldn’t put them through that. I had the ability to give these things mercy. I could send them to eternal sleep.

They wouldn’t know, right?

I was already right-clicking on Jude’s name and scrolling down to DELETE. 

That word had meant nothing to me when playing games, and yet now, it gave me the ability to grant life or death.

I could erase this thing from existence, and it would never even know.

Before I could delete him, though, my gaze caught the rest of the files open on the left of the screen. Penn said he wasn’t able to access them, but I wondered if I could. 

I was curious about the building of this game, and how exactly it had managed to create life inside its interface. There were three more files available, the others locked.

I tried to get into the locked one, but no luck. So, I turned my attention to the others: BUILDING, TEXTILES, and NOTES. 

I clicked into “BUILDING,” which was just screenshots of various parts of the town and some character designs. 

The textiles folder was empty, so I clicked on Notes.

Inside, there was a folder named To You, Love 2021.

Clicking into that one, I found myself staring at several text docs in what appeared to be diary entries.

*03/05/2021*

*I don’t know why the guys in the office ignore me. Is it something I’ve done wrong? I’ve tried so many times to talk to them, and they stick their noses up at me.*

*I’m starting to think maybe this job was a bad idea. It’s my dream, but they make it so hard to enjoy it.*

*I made a new friend, at least. He’s a true crime freak, so at least we have something to talk about. But he does talk about it in extensive detail.*

*""I was like, “Dude, you’re scaring HER,” and he looked at me kinda funny. Does he like her? I mean, she's been flirting with me for months, so obviously not. But the way she looks at him does make me suspicious.*

That was the point I wish I stopped digging around these files. 

I don’t know why, but I kept going down the list, clicking on each entry.

*03/06/2021.*

*They stole my ideas today and laughed in my face. Mom says I should talk to someone, but WHO do I talk to? This is the real world, I shouldn’t be getting bullied like in high school! This isn’t fucking fair.* 

*THIS IS MY JOB. WHY ARE They RUINING It? I asked her on a date, and she says she has plans. I've asked her out every single day and it's always that she's busy and never has time, but now she has plans? Who does she have plans with??*

*03/09/2021.*

*I took a break to start on the game. We’re calling it Neverwood. It's my idea, and they’re the ones getting the glory. At lunch, that bitch rejected me again.*

*Does she not understand that I see her? There are so many people here and yet I’m the only one who truly SEES her for who she really is.*

*She’s a bitch for making her way through our whole studio, and not even looking in my direction. It won’t be long before she goes for HIM. I know she has a thing for him, but of course he's playing hard to get.*

*It's painful to watch. He's also got a new friend, some new guy who looks at me like I'm dirt. I've got a bad feeling about this guy. He's like a sociopath.*

*When he DOES communicate with me, he's talking down to me like I'm a child. The asshole never smiles. I caught him talking to the other two today. I hope he gets the hint that he's not welcome.*
 
*03/15/2021*

*I was right. I’m supposed to be using this stupid diary for game progress, but I was RIGHT. They hooked up. I never liked her. Also, the new guy has joined the team. I already hate him. I'm not a fucking coffee boy. What the fuck is a grande frappacino?*

*03/18/2021*

*I love her. I fucking love her, why can’t she see that? Why can’t she see me?* 

*I hate that nobody looks at me and when they do they look at me like there’s something wrong with me.*

*There's nothing wrong with me. I had friends in high school, so why are people assholes in the workplace??? I can’t HELP being the smartest here.*

*I saw the three of them acting all cosy this morning. I'm talking leaning on each other. I think they spent the night together. Did she fuck both of them? 
Does that count as inappropriate behavior in the office????*

*I should be the one taking the credit for a game and an idea that is mine. Not HIMDJKDFJKDJFKDJFKDJFKSJKDHSFJSDHFJDSHJFHSJHFJHDSJGHDSJHGJASHDJHKASJKFDJKGJDKGJK*

*03/20/21.*

*They’re killing me. I don’t think I can do this anymore.*

*They think they’re smarter than me. They think they’re BETTER than me. They're actually dating. She picked both of them and I'm just the coffee boy?? Who the fuck do they think they are???*

*03/28/21.*

*I’m going to try to clear the air with them tonight! Neverwood has just met our first deadline and I think we can make this work. I think I can get her to look at me.*

*I know she doesn't really like them like that*

*She's just confused.*

*I'll talk to her. I'll tell her she's confused, and maybe we can hang out. She did speak to me first. That means I get first dibs, right? I'm smarter than them, and I'll show her that.* 
 
The entries jumped forward, a whole month later. I don’t know why I clicked on it, on this clear descent into insanity.

*04/15/2021.*

*That asshole may be the true crime freak, but I’m the one dumping his body.*

*It was easier than I thought! I didn’t freak out or barf, it felt right, you know? He was the hardest. I used to really like him.*

*But once he started running off his mouth, I was done. He didn't even see me picking up the paperweight.*

*I'm glad he told me all about pressure points, because I'm sure one smack against the temple is pretty killer.*

*Then I killed his best friend. Not before I had fun with the asshole first.*

*They've been looking down on me since I started this job. I gave him life, and then I ended it. Just like that! :D hey, like video game characters!*

*She wasn’t quite as easy. Because I wanted her before I killed her.*

*And the bitch didn’t even let me have that.*

*Fuck her. If I get caught for this, I’m never telling where the bodies are.* 

*Because there are none! LOL.*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Penn's words came back to me like lightning bolts. 

*I dream of another life...*

Stop reading.

I tried to, but something kept my eyes glued to my laptop screen.

Because I was starting to put pieces of this puzzle together. 

Coming closer to that inevitable truth, 

The next text note had an image attached, and as soon as it loaded, I threw up.

At first, I could make out only the white porcelain of a bathtub.

Then I saw the splatters. Severed limbs piled atop one another.

This psychopath had stripped them of their faces, their very identities, leaving nothing but discarded heaps of flesh.

I could see the cruel slices, done for no reason but his sick, twisted pleasure.

A limp arm hung over the edge of the bathtub, an engagement ring still clinging to one finger. 

The next image was a trash can on fire, stuffed with the remnants of clothes, bags, and name tags, snatched away by the flames, taking his filthy secret with them.

The third was only half visible, but even then I could make out half a face.

It was just a head, the body missing, yet the features bore an uncanny resemblance to Jude.

Scrolling further revealed even more horrors. Three adults, bound to chairs.

Eli had turned them into a grotesque photoshoot, posing three people who looked disturbingly like Neverwood’s characters.

Penn was older, his hair grown long and mouse-brown, but the freckles gave him away. 

Jude was a mirror of his digital self. 

Violet was unsettlingly ordinary compared to the game version, who had been beautiful.

And then the photos grew worse.

They began with snapshots of silent screams and desperate pleas for mercy. By the end, their heads were bowed, lifeless, blood pooling across the floor.

*06/27/2021.*

*I went to your funeral today. And as a gift to your parents, I let them know that you guys will eternally live inside Neverwood.*

*Your folks are so happy. I even gave them a beta version. After everything you did to me, I actually had the decency and heart to remember you in some way. I’m such a good friend. But you guys know that, right?*

*I know YOU (yes, you reading this, you piece of shit) are intelligent enough to find this.*

*Vi, I’m so happy that I can date you for real now whenever I want. I've played through your story multiple times!*

*You're an amazing girlfriend. I can love you now, for however long I fucking want, and you'll never have them.*

*I'll just delete them so it's just you and me in Neverwood forever :)*

*Oh, and Penn, we can be best friends now! See! You DID want me!*

Attached to the file was a 2 minute voice clip.

“hahahahahahahahahahah.avi.”

The sound was a little rough, but I could just make out voices in what appeared to be a crowded place.

“Eli’s driving me mad. Dude, he's so fucking weird.”

Penn’s voice was loud and clear, crackling through the speaker.

I could hear clanking silverware. It sounded like they were in a restaurant.

“I dunno, man, I kinda feel sorry for him. I think he, like, likes us. It's kinda cute.”

Jude.

I recognized his voice.

“How?” Violet's laugh crackled through. “He's literally stalking us. Did you see him watching us the other night? He was there for hours.”

“Ignore him, he’ll get tired.” Penn sighed. “Eventually.”

“Yeah, well he's yet to get the hint.” Jude muttered. “It's like talking to a wall.”

“I'm going to tell him.” Penn said. “We can't fuck him over. He could report us.”

Jude spluttered. “The dude ain't reporting anyone. He’ll just cry into his superhero sheets, then he’ll get the fuck over it. He's a twenty-two-year-old virgin. Never been touched. If he doesn't? I dunno, man, maybe Violet can promise him a sympathy blow job.”

A bang made me jump.

“Shhh!” Violet giggled.

“You're insane, and I kind of love it.” Penn muttered.

The three started laughing, and a shiver ripped down my spine.

“Hey, guys, what are you laughing at?”

Eli.

“Memes.” Penn muttered. “Did you, uh, finish the pitch?”

There was an awkward silence before Eli responded. I could hear the exhaustion in his tone.

“I thought you were writing the pitch?”

“Neverwood.” Penn said, exaggerating his voice. “Come on, Eli, it sounds like a Disney show. We need a new name.”

Eli paused before hissing out, “But… that was your idea. Neverwood was your idea!”

Penn laughed again, though this time it was kind of awkward. 

“Uh, no, I didn't. Do you have, like, freakin’ amnesia?”

Penn’s voice was cruel, biting. But part of me understood. He was being cruel to be kind. Instead of leading Eli on, he was cutting him loose.

“We’re the ones doing the work while you sit on your ass,” Penn snapped. “Pull yourself together, Eli. We’re colleagues, not friends.”

Eli exploded, his voice coming out in a strangled hiss. “I have been doing all the work! You three fucking stole my idea!”

“Penn,” his voice was pleading, “why do you even hang around with him? Can't you see he's an asshole? You didn't even like him at first. Didn't you call him a pretentious asshole?”

“Oh, wow, thanks.” Jude exaggerated a cough. “I am so sorry for hurting your wittle feelings at the ripe age of twenty-two.” I could practically hear his eyes rolling. He snorted. “Get a grip, Eli.”

Eli, to my dismay, continued.

“Penn.” He spat. “Why are you doing this to me?” His voice cracked into a yell, and I could sense the awkwardness. “Why do you even hang around with him?”

Jude snorted again. “Doing what? All right, since my boy is too fucking nice, we don't want you here. You're weird, Eli. You stalk us on nights out and stand outside my apartment for hours. Doing what? Do you want me to let you in? Do you want to fuck me?”

Eli’s voice was more of a sharp breath, straight into the speaker. “Violet invited me.”

Jude groaned. “As a joke!”

“Jude.” Penn’s tone was warning, cutting him off. He sighed. “Eli, just go home, okay? I'll see you on Monday.”

When the clip ended, my stomach felt like it was trying to projectile into my throat.
 
This time, I threw my laptop on the floor. 

I needed to break it, but what would breaking it do? 

I fell into a frenzy, my thoughts dancing, and snatched it back up, placing it back on my bed as gently as possible, my gut twisting. It was like I was handling bodies.

I kind of was.

I remember hitting the floor knees first, my head spinning off of its axis.

I killed someone.

Penn's words came into my mind, and my stomach heaved again, phantom bugs skittering up my spine. *It's fate.* 

*It's fate that we always find each other, like something is pulling us together.*

It wasn't…fate.

I had killed the last parts of him holding on.

The remnants entwined inside this psycho game. 

And I almost killed two others.

I was staring at my phone, mentally coercing the words, “murder” in my mind when a text notification popped up from Eli:

“**Did you enjoy the game, Gabs? ;D”**

I went back to the game, all too aware *something* was wrong with Jude and Violet. 

The cellphone icon kept glitching. Violet was calling me– or *trying* to call me. 

**Don't answer it.** Jude’s sprite popped up *over* the start-up screen. His sprite switched to his *rolling eyes* expression. 

**Violet isn't awake. Leave her alone.**

He was pissed, his arms folded. 

**What the [FUCK] did he do? Is he insane? Where did he go?”**

His eyes flicked to *me*, and I felt myself go still, my breath stuck in my throat. 

**”Did YOU do this, [ELI?]”** Jude demanded. His face started to contort. 

**”DIDYOUFUCKingwAKEHIMUP!!!??!?!?? 27283727737272728288383nnmm!??????+”**

I slammed my laptop shut, but it was overheating in my lap. 

A knock on my door startled me, and, with a foggy head, I stumbled downstairs. 

However, when my hand wrapped around the handle, I saw the figure standing outside. 

The figure with no discernible face, a shadow bleeding into existence. 

I blinked, and my front door *glitched*, blurring in and out of view. 

When my phone buzzed, I pulled it out, something slimy creeping up my throat. 

**Can you help me find my body? :(?**

I couldn't reply, and another text popped up. 

**Gabby? It's me. Can you help me find my head? I can't find it :(**

**Please, Gabby. Open the door. I can't find my head.**

1na9vz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1na9vz1/should_you_try_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by KIDISLE,"Testing out the KIDISLE CM9429D coffee maker was an experience that made my daily coffee needs both exciting and oddly mechanical. I'm not someone who needs barista-level results at home, but I do love convenience and versatility. This unit promised to deliver exactly that, with three-in-one brewing capabilities for K-Cup pods, ground coffee, and even tea. Over several weeks of caffeinated adventures, I’ve grown quite attached to it, though there were some quirks to be mindful of.  

**Compact Design and Space-Efficiency**  
Living in a rather small apartment means countertop real estate is precious, and I was thrilled to discover that this machine is less than 5.1 inches wide. It tucks into the corner of my kitchen like it was custom-made for the space. The stylish black finish adds a sleek vibe to my otherwise modest coffee station. I mean, how can something so small pack so much functionality? Despite its compactness, it isn't light when you pick it up—the machine feels durable, which is reassuring.

**Brewing Versatility and Functionality**  
Out of the box, the coffee maker comes equipped with two adaptors and a reusable capsule. Honestly, I was so excited to test how it brewed each option—K-Cups, ground coffee, and tea. The unit supports most popular K-Cup brands, which worked flawlessly during my trial runs, brewing rich, evenly extracted coffee each time. For those mornings when you have no pods lying around, ground coffee is a lifesaver—or, as I discovered during a particularly lazy weekend, it’s also handy for steeping loose-leaf tea. Switching between brewing modes was seamless enough, though it did take me a couple of attempts to perfect how much ground coffee to use.  

[Check KIDISLE CM9429D price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)  

**Custom Brewing Options**  
One of this coffee maker’s ""strong points"" is its flexibility to brew in five different sizes, ranging from 6 ounces all the way to 14 ounces. I cannot overstate how much I loved this feature, especially for family dinners or when hosting friends. Each of us preferred different portions, so whether I needed a small boost to wake up or a large mug to power through work-from-home meetings, this machine delivered. The stainless steel travel mug that fits up to 7.2 inches under the spout was a thoughtful addition, particularly for my brother, who tends to run out the door with coffee in hand.  

**Self-Cleaning Capability**  
The inner neat freak in me rejoiced upon realizing the automatic self-cleaning feature existed. Pressing the ""SIZE"" and ""BREW"" buttons simultaneously activates its cleaning program, which is simple enough even for my technologically challenged cousin to figure out. Cleaning the coffee maker regularly helped avoid clogging issues, and it remained perfectly operational for weeks, even with heavy use. However, don’t skip out on this feature—neglecting proper cleaning could land you with inconsistent brews.  

**Advantages**  
• Compact footprint, great for small spaces  
• Three-in-one functionality for K-Cup pods, ground coffee, and tea  
• Five customizable cup sizes with an included travel mug  
• Convenient and effective self-cleaning program  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Slightly noisy while brewing—it’s not deafening, but definitely not the quietest  
• Some trial and error needed for perfecting ground coffee proportions  
• The removable drip tray, while helpful, could feel a bit flimsy  

**Product Alternatives**  
Coffee machines in this category have no shortage of competition. Popular models like the Keurig K-Mini certainly give the KIDISLE CM9429D a run for its money when it comes to simplicity and brand reliability. Keurig has an edge with its wider selection of pod variants, but it slightly lacks when it comes to multi-functional use like brewing tea or ground coffee directly. On the other hand, if customization is a priority, something like the Nespresso Essenza Mini might be worth considering; however, the pods for it can be pricey. The KIDISLE coffee machine holds its ground with its affordability and added versatility.  

**Price Performance**  
Speaking of affordability, one of the things I noticed immediately about this coffee maker is how much value it packs at its price point. While it doesn’t compete with premium machines offering ultra-smooth espresso, it does an excellent job within its category. If you’re eyeing something reliable with multi-functionality but don’t want to break the bank, this is worth considering. For budget-conscious coffee lovers who also dabble in tea, this coffee maker prioritizes cost-effectiveness without compromising too much on performance.

i was in a pretty severe mental health episode for about 2 months and i would say it ended about 2 weeks ago. Now that I'm medicated, i feel much more in control of things, but i want to make sure that i don't isolate myself. 

now some fun things about me! 

i work in education, i love to read, write, draw, play music, and go to the beach. my favorite ice cream is cotton candy and vanilla. 

other things i like: the muppets, formula 1, dragon ball z, lofi, jazz, coffee, museums, GTA V, diet coke, cycling

So instead of being the first to reach out once again, I’m leaving this into the void to clear my heart. I can’t help but wonder if I misunderstood. You have to admit of at least a few mixed signals you may have given, if that was the case.
Best case scenario: You’ve forgotten my eyes, voice, the way my hugs feel, and the way you kissed the top of my head. Thoughts of me don’t linger on your mind, you’re happy, and thriving. 
Worst case scenario: I misunderstood your friendship for interest, and allowed myself to put far too much weight on your actions or words. Even worse however, would be that I didn’t misunderstand, and you hate me.

I shouldn’t have finished my last drink (or two) the time we spoke about things; I would have had a clear mind to express myself better. I felt compelled to open up to you, but didn’t. If by some chance it was liquid courage that lead your side of the conversation and you spoke your truth, rather than simply drunken nothings, I’m very sorry.  I’m sorry for not being as vulnerable as you, and for not saying the things I held back. You have more experience there, but I would have wanted to learn from you. I’m sorry I didn’t reciprocate your honesty at the time. Time felt fleeting, my thoughts were jumbled, and I couldn’t trust that I understood your words correctly. I still don’t know if I did, but your subsequent actions lead me to feel otherwise.
I wanted to talk through it all, but your delayed response made me afraid of looking like a fool. Feelings you shared with me were mutual, if that’s possible, with all considering. I’m still ruminating everything that happened then, and has happened since.
Looking back, perhaps your phone rang and interrupted our conversation for a reason.
Perhaps the purpose you came  into my life, was simply to remind me what it’s like to feel valued again, truly understood, respected, and to help me fall in love with myself again and to remember how to put myself first. Maybe one day we’ll grab coffee and I’ll be brave enough to thank you for it all. I wish I had the same impact on you, even if I’m not the one by your side. I hope you learned to love yourself, no longer feel like you have in the past, and you learned to see the strong, kind, fierce parts of you that I saw despite your protest. You’re smart, brave, empathetic, diligent with strong morals, and have a respectable work ethic. How could a girl not fall under your spell?",7,1757190143.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.77,False

So I'm grad student (23M, Brown dude) at Northeastern and honestly... I haven't really found my people yet. Don't get me wrong, I know some folks from classes and stuff, but I'm talking about those real friendships where you can just vibe and be yourself, you know?

I'm pretty chill, down for whatever - grabbing coffee around campus, exploring different neighborhoods in Boston, trying new food spots, maybe hitting up some events or just walking around the city. I feel like there's so much cool stuff happening here that I'm missing out on because I don't have a solid crew to do it with.

If you're also looking to expand your social circle or just want to hang with someone new, hit me up! I promise I'm not weird lol, just genuinely trying to make some real connections in this city.

Anyone else feel like making friends as a college student in Boston is harder than expected? Or is it just me? 😅

so there is this girl I really like, we knew each other in highschool and were in the same class but didnt really talk that much other than a project here and there,

 anyways fast forward 2 years
we are in community college in the same city still and we hangout from time to time now, sometimes we will text and text about whatever for a while, sometimes we'll hop in a vc and play videogames together, or just talk about whatever

recently we have gotten coffee and food together and also gone out to get food with another friend about 2 weeks ago
 when we were getting food that one time with the friend idk if i misheard her but she said that she would usually hangout with anyone else as long as there was a plus one, but then she said with me she wouldnt mind hanging out with just me and her   <im probably overthinking all that lol

anyways since we got food that one time ive been trying to hangout with her again but she has been busy every single time ive asked   im in painnnnnn   

i want to just ask her again but this time ask her if we can call it a date
