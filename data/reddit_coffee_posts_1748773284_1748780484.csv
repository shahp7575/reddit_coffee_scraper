1l0nma2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1l0nma2/what_are_some_ways_that_i_can_tell_my_boy/,What are some ways that I can tell my boy bestfriend likes me ?,"Basically I am a 22F and he is 22M.

We both graduated university a year ago, where we studied the same course. We live relatively near each other so since coming out we ended up hanging out quite a bit. During uni we would always go to the library to get assignments done etc with others in our friendship group, sometimes alone, so once we came out of uni we carried the same dynamic. We would link up and get work done, either in the local library / coffee shops etc, or we would just chill / talk/ hang. we did this for the whole of summer.

During the summer till the end of the year, we would talk a good few times a week, after that it became everyday. He runs a business and so do I, but he was a large reason as to why I wanted to take my business full time, as he encouraged me but also for the fact that I was able to see a real life example of being an entrepreneur (most of my friends are going corporate). But anyways, basically we now speak everyday, sometimes I catch him looking at me, but nothing crazy I don’t think. When I did used to speak to guys, I can’t tell if he either didn’t like it, or he’s just interested in the topic of talking about boys, since he is a boy 😂. If he called and I didn’t answer he’d be like “oh, it was your boyfriend” but emphasis on the boyfriend, kinda felt like jealousy but might be a reach. There was a time I didn’t pick up all day, he called a few times, and then had to basically sit me down and tell me how we are very very close, and that If I’m gonna go awall like that I should just let him know.

On the side we also do business together, so it does play a large part to our communication but tbh only half the time as we don’t do business every month. I know quite a lot about his life now, and this sticks out to me cause he once told me if a boy is telling you stuff about his private life then he obviously likes you etc. sorry guys I’m just trying to spit out facts so I don’t type too much😩 in the past I had a friend who when I was grieving a talking stage used it as opportunity to make his move, which I didn’t appreciate , and I expressed this to him. So I feel like even if he did like me, maybe he wouldn’t act on it? And I’ve also expressed to him how I need to know someone for timeee before I can really get to that stage and like someone, quick romances cringe me and I can’t take them serious 🤣 we’ve also had conversations about what we would want in a partner and in terms of lifestyle he does know that he fits it, but so do a lot of people I know 🤣 we both do still show interest in other people and stuff so in my head I’m thinking this is my brother, but at the same time, the treatment is messing with my head. I do have other male friends who i see as strictly platonic, like brothers to me, but this dynamic just feels different.

He’s not even my type, but he is an attractive person but I’m more attracted to the way he is and his outlook and action on life, if that makes sense. and I don’t know whether I am to him, I feel like I could be, since one girl he liked the look of kind of looks like me, but he doesn’t have a type at all, just an aesthetic I’d say.

Anyways I think I’ll leave this here since it’s quite long, but I’d love to hear a lot you guys perspectives !",1,1748780443.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

Paul Blart had returned to New Jersey, but normal life didn’t quite fit the same anymore. Sure, the West Orange Pavilion Mall still had rogue hoverboard teens and Auntie Anne’s emergencies, but after battling shadow monsters and Russians with portable flamethrowers, nothing could shake that *itch* in the back of his brain.

Then came the envelope. No return address. Inside: a photo of Hawkins Lab rebuilt, active… and glowing red. A note was paper-clipped to the back:

**“They’re back. And they’re not alone.”**  
*D.H.*

“D.H.? Dustin Henderson?” Paul said aloud. “Or... Die Hard?”

Either way, Paul loaded up the Segway, taped extra batteries to his chest, and took the first bus to Indiana.

**Back in Hawkins**

The town looked fine on the surface. But Paul noticed things. A flicker in people’s eyes. A strange hum in the air. And then there were the agents.

Men in black suits were all over town real shady types who wore sunglasses indoors and ordered coffee like it was an interrogation.

It didn’t take long before Paul was reunited with the gang. Dustin, Mike, Lucas, Max, and a power-restored Eleven were now full-blown Upside Down veterans, operating out of the basement of the rebuilt Radio Shack (owned by a mysteriously absent Mr. Clarke). Steve, Robin, and Nancy had uncovered something even worse than Russian spies: a U.S. military faction using leftover gate energy to create something new controlled creatures.

“They're calling it Project Red Ice,” Nancy explained, pointing to a map covered in strings, sticky notes, and way too many photos of frozen cornfields. “They’re trying to *weaponize* the Upside Down.”

“And it's spreading under Hawkins again,” added Eleven. “Only this time, it listens.”

Paul squinted. “Wait… you’re saying the military has a *tame* Demogorgon?”

Robin shook her head. “Not tame. *Programmed.* They’re making an army.”

**Operation: Mall Cop Protocol**

Paul didn’t like it. In fact, he hadn’t liked anything since the ice started forming on Hawkins Lake in the middle of July. He took charge.

“I’ll cause a distraction. You kids sneak in through the tunnels.”

“What distraction?” asked Lucas.

Paul zipped his jacket, strapped on elbow pads, and pulled down his aviator sunglasses. “The only one I know how to do.”

**At the gates of Hawkins Lab…**

Sirens blared. Guards ran in every direction. And through the fog rolled… Paul Blart. His Segway was reinforced with kitchen baking sheets, a leaf blower engine, and what appeared to be a blender filled with glitter.

He was *unstoppable*.

“YOU CAN'T SILENCE SECURITY!” he yelled as he launched frozen pretzels like grenades.

Inside, the gang made their way to the holding chamber. There, in a cryo-pod, stood the *Alpha Demogorgon*  larger, armored, its eyes glowing red with synthetic rage.

Paul burst in just as the creature broke free. Military agents fled. The lights flickered.

Paul stared it down. “Not in *my* jurisdiction, Fluffy.”

The creature roared.

Paul reached into his fanny pack… and pulled out a walkie-talkie.

“Eleven, now!”

BOOM. An explosion rocked the east wing. Eleven pushed herself to the limit, sealing the lab in a swirl of telekinetic force as the Demogorgon screamed and disintegrated into ash this time, for good.

**Epilogue**

The government covered it up. Again.

Blart was offered a “deep state medal of mall-level excellence,” which he politely declined. Instead, he opened a private security agency called **""Blart Watch""**, based in Hawkins  just in case.

The others went back to being teenagers… mostly.

But every now and then, when the lights flickered, or a cold wind blew in from the wrong direction, Paul Blart would grip his Segway’s handlebars just a little tighter.

Because evil never sleeps.

We're accepting new players to Closed Beta, and have added smart watch support for iOS & much more!","Hello there [r/games](https://www.reddit.com/r/games/) ❤️

First off, I have struggled to exercise enough, and I also have ADHD. Gamifying exercise works really well for my dopamine-craving brain, but I'm also easily distracted, so the current mobile fitness games on the market didn't really work for me. That's how I came up with this idea.

Here are some info about the game and how it's different from Pokemon Go for example:

* no distractions. I love games that value my time. WalkScape is designed so that it encourages you not to open it while you're walking, but afterwards. And even if you open it while walking, changing things in the game is super quick.
* no GPS. So you can walk where ever you want. The game tracks your steps even without an internet connection, but you need a connection when you open the game.
* no ads, no MTX. I hate predatory monetisation practises, and they encourage unhealthy spending habits. This game is about both mental and physical health.

In the game, you explore and work in different skills such as woodcutting, foraging, fishing and crafting by walking in real life. The game uses your phone's pedometer to track your progress. It's also online, so you can work with your friends towards common goals without needing to be physically in the same location.

The game has dozens of locations, hundreds of items, NPCs, shops and more is coming as I work towards the full release of the game. There's a lot of different unique and cute activities in the game you can set your character to do in addition to the typical woodcutting and mining, like volunteering in soup kitchen or helping locals repairing their boats. All fueled by walking IRL.

We've added the following things recently to the game, while we have also updated [the roadmap on our website](https://walkscape.app/roadmap):

* **Smart watch support for iOS!** No need to carry your phone with you while walking, as you can on iOS now use your Apple Watch, Garmin etc. to track your steps. Smart watch support is coming to Android later too!
* An entirely new skill, Trinketry. Craft rings, amulets and more shiny things using the new skill!
* A lot more content. Entirely new region, a lot of new items, achievements, crafting recipes, locations, shops and more!
* Bunch of other improvements, minor features, Quality of Life updates!

If you feel like you'd like to try it out, you can either apply to the closed beta (we're inviting more people right now) or if you like to support the development, you get instant to access through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WalkScape) or [Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/walkscape) to start playing. The game is completely community funded.

Whether you decide to support or apply to the closed beta, you'll need to sign up at [WalkScape Portal ](https://portal.walkscape.app/)to the game and then apply or connect your Patreon on the [account page](https://portal.walkscape.app/account).

You can also check our this video to hear me and the artist explain more about the game: [Youtube introduction video](https://youtu.be/RjaQeb5Rapg?si=AUeqlLpEdBGDOC-y)

Or you can [visit the website](https://walkscape.app/).

We also have my devblogs released every two weeks available at [r/WalkScape](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/)

It's been a wild journey for me growing this thing from my personal hobby project, and awesome to see the game helping so many people to exercise more. I'll answer any questions you might have in the comments!

1l0nb8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1l0nb8h/emotionally_exhausted_from_a_just_friends/,Emotionally exhausted from a “just friends” situation with my limerent object. Need to vent.,"Hey everyone,

I'm emotionally drained and really confused by a ""just friends"" dynamic with someone I’ve developed strong feelings for (my limerent object/LO). I need to vent and maybe hear some outside perspective.

So, early on, I asked her to coffee, and she told me clearly that she’s only looking for friendship. I accepted that verbally and tried to respect it. But since then, the dynamic hasn’t felt very “just friends” — at least not in a consistent or healthy way.

I tried building a friendship — which, in hindsight, was a mistake. But I was influenced by advice like “good relationships start with friendship” (especially in church circles). So I gave it my all. I even made an Excel sheet to track how I could connect better, and sometimes processed our texts with AI to make sure I wasn’t overthinking.

The AI (and my guy friends) often say “it’s just friendship, don’t overthink.” But when I show those same convos to female friends, they sometimes pick up on flirty or emotionally intimate tones. It’s confusing.

Here’s what makes it hard:

* She occasionally opens up in deeply vulnerable ways — like asking, “Did you hang out with me because you wanted to, or because you pity me?”

* But when I try to respond with emotional care or seek clarity, she often drops the convo or changes the topic entirely.

* Communication is mostly limited to texts, group events, or occasional voice notes. Never one-on-one calls. It's difficult to have any depth.


For example, I invited her to a Greek lunch we had talked about. She seemed excited — then went silent for days. No confirmation, no response to event-related messages. She finally showed up just before it started, and while I was glad to see her, I felt completely wrecked. I had no idea if she even wanted to come, and her silence felt like emotional whiplash.

I feel like I’m just here to give her emotional reassurance or be vented at. And then when I need anything deeper or mutual, she retreats.

What makes this even more complicated is... I recently started dating someone else. She’s kind and consistent, but I’m not physically attracted to her, and honestly, I don’t truly care about her. I think I mostly like that she likes me. It feels like I’m just settling — and that makes me feel even worse. I don’t want to treat anyone like a backup plan, but I also don’t want to be alone anymore.

Part of me wonders: am I becoming to this other girl what my LO is to me? Emotionally available, but not really what she’s looking for?

I plan to reach out to my LO soon with a message asking for clarity — just so I’m not stuck in this anxiety and confusion anymore. But it’s hard. We go to the same church, and I care about our community. I don’t want to blow things up, but I also can’t keep walking in this emotional fog.

Thanks for reading. I’m just looking for peace of mind right now.",2,1748779437.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I'm gaining weight.,"I kind of feel betrayed by it. Like sure, during the day I'm not as obsessed with food, but by afternoon my medication has worn off and I do not have the impulse control to stop myself. While I can recognize, logically, that I'm not actually hungry or whatever it is, the food noise is so intense and I don't have the impulse control to not fall for it. I'm trying to figure out how to choose better when I'm in that state, but it's usually not until later that I realize that it wasn't a true craving or something I actually needed in that moment.

I'm also so angry and frustrated because I know that I should eat food with my medication, and that means that it will work better for me, but I WANT TO eat breakfast with my colleagues at work like everyone else does. But I have tried before to take my meds with me to work, but I either forget to take my medication with me to work, forget to take it at work, or forget the pill box to take the medication with me the next day at work. I just can't do it that way. So I would have to start eating breakfast at home and miss one of the few opportunities during the day to hang-out with my colleagues. 

The medication has helped some with food noise, but there's a whole second part of the day where the food noise comes back and it comes back with a vengence. 

I'm just frustrated. Like why do I have to have the ADHD that makes me food obsessed? I know the ones who forget to eat are struggling too, but this is also a huge fucking struggle because I am so tired of how people treat me because I'm fat. Like I got a fucking coke zero after lunch one day, which I get once a week, and someone asks me if I really need that. Like stfu you're on your 8th coffee with milk. 

Now I'm trying to do better meal plans and keep things in the fridge that I can just heat up... but I'm just sad that the meds didn't help with this because it's honestly harder to go from no food noise during the day to all the food noise at night. The switch up makes me think I genuinely need all the food, whereas before I knew it was just noise to ignore. And it's easy to say when you don't have the noise that it's just noise, but it's so hard to ignore it when it suddenly jumps at you like a three year old asking for ice cream. 

Is anyone else struggling with this?? How do you handle it??",2,1748779380.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Perhaps it's the weekend or perhaps a post is being started as I write this. 

So much material, so little time.

The sun is rising and its morning again in Victoria. And a beautiful morning it is.

Which got my brain thinking about a simpler time, a time before a bald idiot prince and his used pleasure appliance kept forcing their way into the algorithm that rules my existence. 

Eventually my mind settled on a phrase from the 1984 political ad titled ""it's morning again in America.""

The ad was a defining moment in advertising and won many awards and an election.

I felt inspired.

Unfortunately, this is all I could come up with. 

Check out the ad on YouTube and have pity on me. I haven't had my coffee yet.

It's morning again in Montecito. 

Today a man and a woman will go to work for maybe an hour. But then again, maybe not given their history.

With interest in their existence barely half what it was in 2020, thousands of people will not be dancing in the streets celebrating their lack of accomplishments.  More than at any time since nobody cared.

This afternoon a pregnant nun carrying a mongoose will buy a pot of jam from a grifter. They will wonder why they are paying twice as much for half as little, but remember the purpose of their existance: to multiply the wealth of those least in need.

People will be born, get married, raise families and pass away. Their meager existance will be enriched by the constant bellowing for attention by a vacuous void with a title you had better fucking remember peasant. 

She is not just a used pleasure appliance. She is so much mor on.

Worship her. Repeat.

It's morning again in Montecito.

Previously, I’ve cruised with Royal, Carnival, Celebrity, Princess, and I’m planning on giving a chance to NCL. My cruise with MSC was the Seaview through the Mediterranean. My god was it messy. When we first got to the cruise, after spending almost 24 hours traveling to France, our room had a stained/ripped sofa, a scent of multiple sh*ts coming from the toilet seat, and the door’s key reader did not work whatsoever. We spent our first afternoon in our room waiting for the crew to diagnose and fix the key reader, we spent multiple trips to the reception for them to agree to replace the putrid toilet seat and to put a cover on the f*ck*d up sofa. We were drained and fuming on what we were welcomed with. They eventually agreed to replace/fix the latter (also offered a concession), but we had to repeatedly tell them to do so. I have NEVER been through this with the other cruise lines. Also, the food was subpar compared to the others. Some things were delicious while other items were plainly indigestible. They were very inconsistent with their quality. I even found their menu offerings boring, during the whole week, 90% of the menu remained unchanged and the things they changed you would try them wondering if it was going to be good or not. Nonetheless, this cruise is for us alcoholics and coffee lovers ‘cause there was a bar in every corner and the drinks were good. On another note, don’t get me started on the hidden fees and the automatic 1€ donation to their foundation… why doesn’t their CEO donate from his pocket, from his billions net worth? This cruise was just plainly stressful and untrustworthy. Shoutout to some crew members that try their best considering the culture of this company.

My name’s Paige, I’m 22, and I just moved to Austin from Bakersfield, California. This is my first real post here, and honestly, it’s kind of a big step for me.

I recently got out of a really toxic and controlling relationship. For a long time, I wasn’t even allowed to have social media or really make new friends. I lost a lot of who I was. But I’m finally free now, and trying to rediscover me. It’s both scary and exciting.

I moved to Austin for a fresh start — new place, new energy, new people. I love books, coffee shops, playing basketball, going to the beach (when I can find one 😅), and just vibing with kind, genuine folks. I’m hoping to meet some cool people here who are open to friendships, advice, or even just chatting. I could really use a good community around me right now.

Thanks for reading. Feel free to say hi 💛

Ideally one that can match a 1Zpresso K-Ultra's cup results in an automated way. I read half of reddit, but still torn between 3 options and need advice on burr profiles that would replicate this flavour.

# My Situation

**Current Setup:**

* Decent DE1
* Compak E6 OD (want to replace)
* 1Zpresso K-Ultra (LOVE the taste but daily use too much work)

**Usage:** 85% Americano's(!), 10% Espresso 5% milk drinks for guests, mostly medium to medium-light roasts (\~2.5kg monthly)

# The current problem:

I **vastly prefer** my K-Ultra's taste over my Compak E6. The K-Ultra produces incredibly **round** **and rich cups** still having amazing **clarity and separation** of flavours - especially the acidity and sweet notes really pop. It's exactly what I want in my coffee. The Compak burr dimension unfortunately is not compatible to SSP or other 3rd party burrs.

But hand-grinding 2.5kg monthly is not an option. Also single-dosing is not the workflow I want as my daily driver. I think a grind-by-weight electric that can match this flavour profile would be perfect.

# My 3 finalists:

1. **Fiorenzato Allground Sense (Plus)** (\~€1,200 + maybe €200 for different SSP burrs)
2. **Etzinger EtzMAX LM** (\~€1,500)
3. **Eureka Mignon Libra 65 AP** (\~€800 + €150 for different [Black Diamond burrs](https://www.eureka.co.it/de/products/black+diamond+burrs/1/1/index.aspx))

# My main question(s):

**🔥 Which burr profile would best replicate the K-Ultra's character**?

* SSP 64mm Multipurpose? (for Allground Sense)
* Etzinger's RRB technology with conical burrs
* Eureka Black Diamond (All Purpose?) burrs
* Or something else I'm missing?

**Does flat vs conical make a meaningful difference here?** The K-Ultra has 48mm heptagonal conical burrs - can I still replicate this with a specific profiled flat burrs or is the Etzinger here closest by design?

# What I Value Most:

1. **Ground/Taste quality**
2. **Convenience** (fast, robust workflow)
3. **Low retention**
4. **Easy cleaning**
5. **Future-proof/solid/upgradeable**

Has anyone made a similar transition from loving a specific hand grinder to finding an electric that matches? What burr geometry should I be targeting?

Physically, mentally, emotionally — I feel completely broken. My joints keep popping, especially in my knees, and I have no idea if I’m sick or just falling apart for no reason. I have dilated veins on my scrotum and penis, bilateral varicocele, and what feels like Peyronie’s disease (I can feel two hard cord-like plaques and there’s a visible curve and indentation in my penis). It’s humiliating and terrifying.
I also have spider veins on my chest, broken capillaries on legs, dilated red veins on the white of my eyes (sclera) becuase of dry eye syndrome, and the beginnings of varicose veins — and all of this at just 24 years old.
I used to look good. There was a time I was fit, confident, and even considered modeling. But everything started going downhill after varicocele and inguinal hernia surgery. My life changed completely.
On top of that, I ve made mistakes too. I abused pre-workout, Xanax, phenibut, and other substances just to cope with anxiety, depression and pressure from my parents. I didn t know how to deal with the pressure and depression. On top of that-compulsive masturbation. Now I m clean — just coffee — but the damage feels done.
Emotionally… I have no close friends. I have no beautiful memories to look back on, except the times when I had money and some sense of stability. My last relationship — we tried twice — but it failed badly both times but it was the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me. 

My parents don’t get it. They think it s all in my head. They re religious and all they tell me is to go to church, pray more, be grateful. But how can I feel grateful when I feel like a ruined version of who I used to be?

Honestly… what’s left for someone like me? What’s the point of any of this?
I m afraid that I will not live at least a normal life from now on without health problems . 
I m really afraid that I will not get married one day and not be able to have kids because of varicocel and peyronie .

Unveiling the Truth Behind the Buzz,"Coffee is more than just a morning ritual. For millions around the globe, it’s a flavorful companion that boosts alertness and improves mood. But lately, coffee has found itself at the center of a health debate: **Does coffee help you lose weight?** The answer is layered — and to uncover the truth, we need to explore the science, personal experiences, expert opinions, and real-life stories from coffee lovers.

At [**GoMehedi.com**](https://gomehedi.com), we specialize in researching and reviewing coffee, kitchen appliances, and nutrition-based topics to bring you the most reliable and trustworthy insights. Let's dive into the science-backed facts and the real-world experiences surrounding coffee and weight loss.

 

# ☕ The Science Behind Coffee and Weight Loss

Several scientific studies suggest that **coffee may aid in weight loss** — but it’s not magic. It’s about how coffee interacts with your **metabolism, appetite, and fat-burning process**.

# 1. Boosts Metabolism

Coffee contains **caffeine**, a natural stimulant that boosts your **resting metabolic rate (RMR)** — the number of calories your body burns at rest. According to a study published in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, caffeine can **increase metabolic rate by 3–11%**, making it easier to burn more calories throughout the day.

✅ **Expert Insight**: *Dr. Maria Jennings*, a nutritionist and coffee researcher from the University of London, says:  
*“Caffeine increases thermogenesis — the heat your body generates when digesting food. This slight boost may support weight loss if paired with proper diet and exercise.”*

# 2. Suppresses Appetite (Temporarily)

Drinking black coffee before meals may **temporarily suppress appetite**, helping people reduce calorie intake. This is particularly useful for those who practice intermittent fasting or low-calorie diets.

💡 **User Experience**:  
*Alex P., a health-conscious father from Ohio, shared with GoMehedi:*  
*“I replaced sugary morning beverages with black coffee, and surprisingly, I wasn't as hungry at lunch. It helped me snack less throughout the day.”*

# 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Caffeine increases **adrenaline levels**, giving your body a quick energy boost — perfect before a workout. That’s why many **pre-workout supplements include caffeine** as a key ingredient. Improved performance means **burning more calories and fat** during exercise.

 

# 🚫 The Limitations and Risks

While coffee may support weight loss, relying solely on it is not a healthy or sustainable approach. Overconsumption can lead to **insomnia, anxiety, increased heart rate**, and even **digestive issues**.

·         **Sugar & Creamer Alert**:  
Adding sugar, syrups, or high-calorie creamers can sabotage your weight loss goals.  
✅ Stick to **black coffee**, or add unsweetened almond milk and natural spices like **cinnamon** or **turmeric** for added benefits.

🧠 **Expert Tip**: *Registered dietitian Emily Hartfield notes:*  
*“Coffee is a supportive tool, not a solution. It works best when combined with a balanced diet and active lifestyle.”*

 

# 💬 What Our Audience Is Saying – Real Interviews

To understand how coffee plays a role in daily routines, we interviewed over 100 users on [GoMehedi.com](http://GoMehedi.com) and social media platforms.

# 🔹 Samantha L., 34, NYC – Down 15 lbs in 3 Months

“I started drinking mushroom-infused black coffee from the recommendations on gomehedi.com. I followed a low-carb diet and used coffee as a pre-workout. I felt energized and full. It made fasting a lot easier.”

# 🔹 James B., 41, Texas – Lost 22 lbs in 5 Months

“I replaced my sugary drinks with organic instant coffee. It was an easy switch that reduced my calorie intake. I also walked every day. The consistent energy from coffee really helped.”

These stories show that **coffee can be a powerful companion** on a weight loss journey when used mindfully.

 

# 🧬 Which Types of Coffee Are Best for Weight Loss?

Not all coffee is equal when it comes to supporting your goals. Based on extensive research and user reviews on [**GoMehedi.com**](https://gomehedi.com), here are the top types of coffee that may help:

·         **Black Coffee** – Zero calories, zero sugar.

·         **Green Coffee Beans** – Rich in chlorogenic acid, may help burn fat.

·         **Mushroom Coffee** – Combines caffeine with adaptogens like Lion's Mane & Chaga.

👉 Check out our expert guide to the [**Best Coffee for Weight Loss** on GoMehedi.com](https://gomehedi.com) for in-depth reviews and suggestions.

 

# ✅ Final Verdict: Does Coffee Help You Lose Weight?

**Yes — coffee can support weight loss, but it is not a standalone solution.** When combined with:

·         A healthy, balanced diet

·         Regular physical activity

·         Adequate hydration

·         Quality sleep

·         Mindful consumption (no sugary add-ons)

…it can **enhance metabolism, curb hunger, and improve workout performance.**

Recently I’ve tried swapping out the bottle for straw cups when serving milk, but she starts freaking out and slapping the cup away and eventually haves a meltdown first thing in the morning.

Today I even tried showing her, “look we’re pouring the milk into your cup!” To make her realize it’s not water, it’s milk, but she still wasn’t having it.

She does get plenty of dairy in other ways but at this point the milk is like her having her cup of coffee she like needs it to function 🤣

But, she was just visiting my city.

Ever since we talked daily and have had a couple of video calls and the interest level has only seemed to strengthen. If we lived in the same area I don't see why we wouldn't have gone on 2 or 3 more dates by now. But here's the issue, we both have kids between the ages of 5 and 10 and it's not like either of us is packing up and leaving our areas.

Flights to each other's city are relatively cheap as far as air travel goes, so we're talking about me going to see her for a long weekend when we both don't have our kids - I would get a hotel so there's no expectations and we have the opportunity for separation as needed.

We followed the sound, and I wish we hadn’t.","Series - [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l0mmqt/they_say_if_you_hear_the_lullaby_in_the_woods_of/)

I think grief ages you in strange places. Not your bones or your skin, but the parts of your soul that were still soft...still untouched by the sharper edges of the world. That summer — the one where the trees cried and the fox screamed and Gracie Redwell vanished — it didn’t just take people. It took time. It took childhood. It left Nathan and me in the kind of silence that felt like the inside of a locked drawer.



We tried. God, we tried.



After Gracie went missing, we combed the woods for weeks like two idiot detectives with scraped knees and too much desperation. We told each other we were doing it for her, but deep down we were doing it for Caleb. To prove that we hadn’t imagined the lullaby...hadn’t invented the dead fox or the stitch-up girl beneath the playground. We wanted to believe that what happened that summer was something we could make sense of.



But it wasn't.



Caleb’s death came barely two weeks after Gracie’s. People whispered things like “terrible timing” and “such a shame,” like the universe had just rolled a bad hand. The story everyone swallowed, the one the sheriff signed off on, was that Caleb had been drinking. Lost control of the truck somewhere past Miller’s Hill. They found him in a ditch, his chest folded inwards like a letter never meant to be opened.



But we knew better.



Caleb wasn’t perfect. He drank, yeah. Smoked too. But he didn’t lose control. Not like that. He was a Marine. He’d survived two tours and a roadside bomb. He could drive through rain with his eyes half-closed and still know when to brake before a rabbit darted out. So no, we didn’t believe it. Nathan didn’t say much at the funeral, just stood there in that wrinkled shirt and clenched jaw, like if he grieved too loudly, something would hear and come for him next.



After Caleb, Nathan was basically an orphan. His mother, Marie, was a ghost in her own home. She'd already vanished long before Caleb died, long before the lullaby came crawling out of the trees. She had this way of looking through people, like you were made of glass and something uglier was on the other side. The only time she spoke in full sentences was when she was screaming. And when she wasn’t screaming, she was staring at that empty corner of the room, like a ghost was standing in it.



Caleb had tried to protect Nate from that. From her. From everything.



He never said it out loud, but I think he knew something was wrong with this town. He carried it in his silences, in the way his eyes darted to the woods even when we were blocks away, like he was waiting for something to walk out. Something older than roads. Something that didn’t care about how many guns you’d fired or how many medals you’d earned.



Still...he never told us. Maybe he thought we’d be safer if we didn’t know. But some things don’t stay buried. They claw their way up eventually. And by the time we were old enough to understand what he’d been hiding, we were already too deep in it.



There’s something about grief that makes everything else feel like background noise. Homework, school dances, sleepovers, none of it mattered. We were just surviving. Floating. High school started like a whisper, not a bang. Freshman year bled into sophomore like we were slipping under water, and no one noticed. People stopped talking about Gracie. Stopped talking about Caleb. Like forgetting was easier than remembering the holes they left behind.



But we remembered.



There are whispers now. Not just in the locker rooms or behind the gym bleachers, but in the halls, behind cupped hands, passed like cigarette smoke between kids too bored or broken to care. The Lullaby isn’t just some tale anymore. It’s a rite. A dare. A sick tradition.



Someone scratched it into the underside of a desk in Room 12B: “Go hear it or don’t come back.”



And someone always does.



Jonah Matthews was the first that fall. Skinny kid, uneven bangs, eyes too wide for his face, used to laugh with this sort of wheezy snort that made the whole class smile, even the teachers. I don’t think he really wanted to go. But there’s a kind of peer pressure in small towns like ours, especially when no one wants to talk about what's actually broken.



He went. Alone, they say. Came back the next morning, shoes wet, arms scratched like he’d run blindly through the bramble. He didn’t say a word. Not even when his mom screamed in his face, slapped him out of panic. Just stood there, trembling.



A week later, we watched him climb the roof of the town library.



I remember the way Nathan grabbed my arm when someone screamed. The thud of Jonah’s body landing. He didn’t die. Shattered both legs, broke his jaw. The whole town gathered like it was a carnival.



No one mentioned the woods.



Then came Benny Lowen.



Benny was different. Soft. Gentle. The kind of boy who stopped to help worms off the sidewalk after it rained. He didn’t speak much, but when he did, it was always kind. Wore thick sweaters and smiled with his whole face. No one ever teased him. Not even the assholes.



One Monday morning, he just didn’t show up.



His parents thought he’d run away. Said he’d been acting odd. But Nathan didn’t buy it. Neither did I. Benny wasn’t the kind of kid who left people. He was the kind of kid you’d find waiting by the swings long after recess ended, hoping you’d come back.



The town grieved. The way Dovetail Ridge grieves. A few posters. Some casseroles. A candlelight vigil that turned into a PTA meeting about “security protocols.” Two weeks later, the missing posters peeled off the telephone poles and no one bothered to tape them back up.



But we remembered.



Nathan said nothing the day Benny vanished. Just kept his head down, hoodie up, picking at the raw skin around his thumbnail. I tried to talk to him at lunch. Got maybe four words.



‘Something’s happening again.’



That was it.



I sat with him anyway, like I always did.



By October, the air tasted like rust, and the leaves burned themselves orange in protest.



I was walking with Ty and Marshall down the back path toward gym when Ty bumped his elbow into me.



‘Yo, Liam,’ he smirked. ‘You talk to Elise yet? Or still writing poems about her in your crusty notebook?’



Marshall snorted.



I rolled my eyes, smiling just enough to play along. ‘Yeah, I wrote her a sonnet on the back of my detention slip. Romantic, huh?’



‘Bet she framed it,’ Marshall laughed, then glanced around. ‘Where’s your shadow? Haven’t seen Nathan all week.’



‘He’s been...I dunno. Home, I guess. Sick.’



‘Sick or just full-on haunted?’



‘Shut up, Marsh.’



‘I mean, c’mon,’ Ty said, voice dropping low. ‘You guys still messing around with that lullaby crap?’



‘No,’ I said. Too fast.



They didn’t believe me, but they didn’t push it either.



As we rounded the corner into the main hallway, the bell rang and kids scattered like roaches. That’s when we saw Principal Hewitt waddling his way past the trophy case, his cane tapping softly against the tiles. Always wore that same grey cardigan with the elbow patches. A little hunched, but still sharp in the eyes.



He looked at every student like they were the most important person in the world.



‘Gentlemen,’ he greeted with a warm nod. ‘Staying out of trouble, I hope?’



‘Always,’ Ty said, flashing a grin.



Principal Hewitt smiled at me a little longer than the others, like he knew something I didn’t. Like he was remembering something that never left him.



‘You give that brother of yours my regards,’ he said to me, patting my arm gently. ‘And if either of you boys ever need someone to talk to... my door’s open.’



He meant Nathan. People still thought we were brothers sometimes. We weren’t, but I never corrected them.



‘Thanks, sir,’ I muttered.



He walked on, slow but steady. I saw Sheriff Rick Delaney waiting outside in his cruiser, the two of them sharing coffee most mornings. Some old-town routine. Two relics from a better past, maybe.



After school, I found Nathan sitting under the bleachers by the football field, knees pulled to his chest, earbuds in but nothing playing.



‘Hey,’ I said, dropping beside him. ‘You missed trig. Again.’



‘Didn’t feel like it.’



‘You okay?’



He hesitated. Then nodded. Then shook his head.



‘That kid...Jonah,’ he said. ‘You know he hasn’t spoken since?’



‘I know.’



‘And Benny? He didn’t run away.’



I didn’t respond.



‘They’re connected,’ Nathan whispered. ‘It’s the Lullaby. Or whatever comes after it. Something’s wrong, Liam. Something’s always been wrong.’



‘I know,’ I said. ‘But we can’t—’



‘Why not?’ he snapped, then softened. ‘Why the hell not, Liam? We live here. It’s our town too. If no one else is gonna look, maybe we have to.’



‘And then what?’ I said. ‘We end up like Jonah? Like Benny? You wanna be a ghost story?’



Nathan looked at me, eyes hollow.



‘We already are.’



I didn’t say anything after that. Just sat with him until the sky turned the color of old bruises.



We didn’t speak much on the way home. The leaves crackled under our boots, and the wind pressed against our jackets like some quiet, invisible warning. It was just the two of us walking that lonely stretch of sidewalk back into town, but the silence felt crowded. Nathan’s shoulders were tight. His eyes darted, sometimes toward the woods, sometimes at nothing at all.



He was jittery. No, not jittery. He was withholding. There was something pressed hard and sharp behind his ribs, something he wasn’t telling me. I knew that shape. I’d worn it myself the day Caleb died.



‘Nate,’ I said finally, my voice carving through the quiet. ‘You’ve been off. You barely talk anymore.’



He didn’t respond. Just kept walking, staring ahead like there was something waiting for him just beyond the curve in the road.



I quickened my pace and stepped in front of him. ‘Seriously, man, what’s going on with you? People are worried.’



He scoffed. ‘People? What people? I don’t exactly have a fan club.’



‘Yeah, well...maybe because you don’t try,’ I shot back, not out of anger, but frustration. ‘I know you’re hurting. I know it’s been hard since…since everything. But I’m here. I’ve always been here. So maybe act like you give a fuck.’



Nathan stopped walking. His eyes were rimmed red, but not from crying. From exhaustion. From secrets.



‘I don’t need friends,’ he said, almost too soft to hear.



I stared at him. ‘But I’m your friend. Or do you want to tell me that I am wrong about thinking that?’



He looked at me, really looked. And something in his face twisted. Not anger, not annoyance. Guilt.



‘You are my friend,’ he whispered. ‘And that’s why I need to show you something.’



I blinked. ‘Show me what?’



‘Come to mine. I’ll show you.’



I hesitated. ‘Nate, if this is about Caleb—’



‘It is,’ he said quickly. ‘But not the way you think.’



‘Come on. You’re not still looking into that, are you? He died in a—’



‘In a drunk driving accident, yeah, I know the story,’ he cut in. ‘But something doesn’t sit right. You knew that then. I know it now. And I think he knew something. I think he was trying to find out the same things we started sniffing around that summer.’



His words clawed at my ribs.



‘Trust me, Liam. What I found...it’s insane. You need to see it for yourself.’



I nodded slowly, unease blooming behind my eyes. ‘Okay. Take me.’



\*\*\*



We didn’t go inside the house. Instead, he led me past the broken fence slats and through the brittle weeds that curled along the side of the yard. The shed stood behind it all like an unwanted memory. Caleb’s place.



It hadn’t changed much. Just older. Emptier. The padlock had long rusted off. Nathan opened the door with a soft groan of metal and age.



The inside smelled like dust and forgotten sweat. His tools were still hanging on the pegboard, hammer, wrench, crowbar, though some were missing. The old workbench was stained with grease and memories.



‘I used to be scared of this place,’ I said, stepping in behind Nate. ‘Back when he was alive.’



‘Yeah. Me too,’ he said. ‘But scared or not, he was the only one who really gave a shit about me. You know that.’



‘I know.’



He crossed to the center of the floor, knelt, and pried up one of the boards.



‘I’d been coming here the past few weeks,’ he said. ‘Just...sitting here. Thinking. Something about the floor felt weird. Like it didn’t settle right. I guess it got into my head. I pulled it up. Found this.’



He reached in and lifted out a metal box. It looked military. Maybe something he’d carried back from deployment. Heavy, dented, locked. He popped the latches.



Inside were cassette tapes. A few newspaper clippings. A small, beat-up notebook with Caleb’s scrawl on the cover: **Field Notes.**



Nathan pulled one clipping and handed it to me.



It wasn’t about Caleb. It was dated five years before his death. The headline read: ***Two Teens Found in Ravine; No Signs of Foul Play***. The story mentioned the bodies of a boy and a girl discovered near the edge of Dovetail’s eastern woods. No clear cause of death. No leads. The names were familiar. I remembered kids whispering them back in middle school.



‘He was keeping these?’ I asked.



Nathan nodded. ‘He was connecting something. I think...I think he knew about the Lullaby. About the other kids.’



I picked up the tape. It had no label. He inserted it into a dusty old player from the shelf. The static hissed, then a voice; Caleb’s, grainy and tired.



‘Log twelve. I think I’m gettin’ closer. Saw tracks today, not animal. Not...human either. They know I’m here. Every time I get close, something goes wrong. Like the woods are pushin’ me back.’



A pause. Then: ‘They’re watching. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.’



The tape clicked off.



We sat there for a while in the dark shed. A quiet so full of ghosts it rang.



Nathan looked over. ‘Promise me you’ll help. You’re all I’ve got, Liam.’



Something inside me shifted. I saw the rawness in his eyes, and I felt it in my own bones. That shared ache. The desperate need to know. To believe we weren’t crazy.



I placed a hand on his shoulder. ‘You don’t even have to ask.’



The wind howled faintly outside. The tools rattled on the pegboard. Somewhere in that noise, I thought I heard a tune.



But I didn’t say a word.



That night, I stayed over at Nate’s.



Of course, my mom didn’t care. She was pulling another night shift, third one this week. Things had been hard at home for a while now. Bills piled up in the kitchen drawer like unopened letters from a future we didn’t ask for. She tried, though. God, she tried. And I think I tried, too, in my own clumsy way. I wanted to pick up shifts after school, maybe something under the table. Just help her breathe a little easier. But at sixteen, sometimes all you can do is watch the people you love fall apart in slow motion.



Nate and I spent the night combing through the box. Clippings, photos, yellowed notebooks full of Caleb’s scratchy handwriting. One thing became clear pretty quickly, though it made everything else murkier.



The Lullaby wasn’t predictable.



Sometimes, people said they heard it twice a month—low and sweet, echoing from the woods like something not quite real. Sometimes it didn’t come at all for months. But the screams… those never stopped. The mountains swallowed them sometimes, sure. But not always. Some cries came back, trembling through the fog. Some didn’t. And sometimes, the ones who returned didn't come back the same.



There were voices that didn’t belong to the people we knew, eyes that didn’t hold the same light. They’d say they were fine. They weren’t.



Caleb knew this. His logs made that painfully clear. And he’d been looking into it long before he ever stepped foot in those woods all those years ago. This wasn’t something he stumbled onto. It was something he chased.



There were maps in the box. Not just street maps, blueprints of underground tunnels, medical records, lists of kids who went missing. Gracie’s name was there too, underlined twice in red.



We worked in silence, then in whispers. Tapes, grainy, hard to decipher. Some were simple dictations of what he’d found. Some didn’t make sense.



One voice recording played like this:



‘March 3rd. Seventeen names. Only six were reported missing. The rest…I don’t know. Unaccounted for. Paper trails don’t match.’



Another:



‘If you match the disappearance dates to the phases of the moon, there’s a correlation—but only when it’s waning. Like something is feeding off the fading.’



We rewound that one twice.



Then, one tape changed everything. The audio was clearer. Caleb sounded tired, but focused.



‘Compliance Protocol 7B. Initiated by presiding citizens. I repeat—Compliance Protocol 7B. The seal is intact. Confirmed involvement of Fraternity of the Ridge.’



The tape clicked. We both froze.



‘Fraternity of the Ridge?’ I said. ‘What the hell is that?’



Nathan stared down at the notebook in his lap, flipping pages faster now.



‘It’s mentioned here,’ he murmured. ‘Twice. See? Next to the phrase “compliance,” and again under something called “Selection Year.”’



He looked up at me. ‘They’re not missing, Liam.’



I blinked. ‘What?’



His voice cracked. ‘They’re not missing. They’re taken.’



We sat in silence, the weight of that word pulling everything under.



Taken.



By who? By what? The police had tried, the sheriff had led searches. But if Caleb was right…if this “Fraternity of the Ridge” was real, then someone had been orchestrating this.



We dug harder. Cross-referencing the clippings with Caleb’s notes. One name kept popping up, a judge who’d served on the town council for over twenty years. A former teacher. A retired surgeon. All seemingly unconnected.



All mentioned in Caleb’s research.



All residents of Dovetail Ridge.



‘I think this Fraternity is real,’ I whispered. ‘A group of people. Old. Maybe secret. Maybe even influential.’



Nathan nodded. ‘They’re the ones behind the Lullaby. It’s not just a song. It’s a signal.’



The next tape was different. Not Caleb’s voice.



A woman’s voice, cold and deliberate:



‘Compliance Protocol 7B shall be maintained until the threshold of silence is achieved. Presiding citizens will rotate selection responsibilities. Dissenters will be processed.’



‘Jesus Christ,’ I said.



Nathan hit stop. We sat in silence, both of us trembling.



This wasn’t just stories anymore. It wasn’t dares. It wasn’t some twisted urban legend the woods whispered on cold nights.



Caleb knew. He got too close.



And then he died.



It wasn’t an accident. Not a mistake. Not just bad luck.



He was silenced.



Because he saw the truth.



And now…we were next in line.



We stared at the last notebook. It was older—stained, with a torn leather cover. Inside, the writing was different. Neater. Almost…formal. Not Caleb’s.



And then we found it. Tucked behind a glued-in page, like it wasn’t meant to be seen.



A letter. Handwritten. Dated 1978.



“To the Presiding Chair of the Fraternity,

The silence has been met. Compliance ensured. The girl from the Outer Borough—processed. Her bloodline is now clear for exemption next cycle. Her parents have signed the Oath. See attached seal.”



Below that, wax residue, the remnants of a red seal, cracked and faded.



Nate’s hand was shaking. He turned the page, and we both froze.



Attached was a photograph.



Grainy. Faded.



Three men in suits. One of them smiling faintly.



Judge Henry Jackson.



I recognized him instantly. So did Nate.



He used to come to our school every year for Career Day. Handed out little pamphlets about civic duty. Talked about the honor of serving your town.



He was standing next to a much younger Sheriff Rick Delaney.



And in the corner, barely visible, stood a girl with a blindfold over her eyes.



Mouth taped shut.



We stared in silence, the truth crashing down like a falling ceiling. This wasn’t a story. It was a system. Buried. Protected. Generational.



We were never meant to find any of this. And somehow, we still didn’t know enough. Because in the bottom of the box, under a stack of photos and clippings, Caleb had left something else.



A map.



One we hadn’t noticed before.



It wasn’t topographical. It was a blueprint—dated and stamped by the Dovetail Ridge Department of Public Works.



Sewage schematics.



But these weren’t just for the town. They extended beyond the residential lines—snaking west, into the woods. The pipes forked like veins beneath the surface. Some were decommissioned. Others labeled with strange initials.



One path was circled in red. Beside it, Caleb had scribbled just three words in shaky handwriting:



“Where the lullaby lives.”



Nate and I looked at each other, dread rising like cold water.



‘It’s not just in the woods,’ he whispered.



I nodded. ‘It’s under them.’



A second map showed vertical shafts—connecting buildings in town to deeper chambers underground.



One line connected to Maple Heights Orphanage. Another to Town Hall. One terminus just said “Intake Chamber: R-7.”



I felt sick.



We still didn’t understand what we were looking at. But something about it—the connections, the red markings, the phrase—



“Where the lullaby lives.”



It made the blood in my body turn to ice.



Looking back now, I wish we’d never opened that damn box.



I wish Nate had left it buried beneath those rotting floorboards. That we’d gone on with our lives thinking Caleb died a hero in a meaningless accident.



Because back then, we thought we were pulling at threads.



We had no idea we were unraveling a noose.



That night in his room, we thought we were just kids with a mystery. Brave, maybe even stupidly brave.



But the truth?



We weren’t brave.



We were marked.



And I’ve been carrying that truth like a splinter in my spine ever since. Some days I think I can take it out. Most days, I just try not to breathe too hard.



But lately…it’s digging deeper.



And God help me, I don’t know how much longer I can go.



Sometimes I dream about burning it all down.



The files. The tapes. The photos. The town.



Everything.



Because maybe the only way to silence a lullaby is to scream louder than the ones who wrote it.

 About a year and a half ago I had a bad UTI that spread to my kidneys, after a round of ciprofloxacin I was back to ""Normal"" except my bladder has been having issues since then.
I2ve started to wet the bed sporadically and this is exacerbated if any alcohol or coffee was drunk during the day. 
I have pretty bad dribbling after urination and at night I've spoken to my primary care that's referred me to a urologist I haven't been able yo take the leap yet because of money/insurance issues.
 I've been managing all this with tape briefs. Currently I keep a trashcan in my room and dispose of them accordingly but its becoming more and more difficult from keeping thia from my roomate.

I (39F) have been knowingly CF since I can remember, and it's great to have this space to feel normal, and safely rant about the frankly infuriating levels of entitlement from some parents out there in the world. Thank you for being you, folks!

Anyway. A recent encounter of parental entitlement keeps wandering into my mind, and I need to rant about it somewhere, so here goes with my first post:

My partner (35M) goes climbing a couple of times a week with a random bunch of other guys he knows. A couple of months ago, he received an FB invite to a ""house warming"" party from one of said climbing buddies - he knows him only through this shared activity, they don't socialise together otherwise, and he doesn't know him that well.

The ""house warming"" invite is written by this dude and his wife. It explains that since they have both recently bought and moved into their house, and they have just had their first baby, they are introducing a  *brand new concept* for this party. It will be a ""work party"" as they have a load of renovation work to do on their house, and they want some help because caring for the baby is taking up all of their energy! A detailed itinerary of the help they want  reveals it is all fairly heavy labour, such as demolition of walls, removing bulky waste and taking it to the waste centre, stripping and painting walls etc. In exchange for this, you might get a coffee and a cake during the day, and they will cook dinner in the evening. How *marvellous*.

Now, if we lived in a less capitalist society without demanding 9-5 jobs and our own life responsibilities to tend to, SURE. I can see the whole village thing as an aspirational view of community, where everyone does their bit to help each other out. However, this couple, who willingly chose to do the two of the most stressful things at the same time (house reno and having a child) are now expecting basically free labour, instead of paying for it. The invite was sent out to over 100 people they vaguely know!

My partner (who has ADHD and gets excited by novelty) was initially positive about doing some hard labour with his buddies - but I reminded him of the fact we are living in the mess of our own house renovation, and we've been doing it ourselves gradually or paying for professionals when we can afford it. We are not putting that expectation on a bunch of people we care about, for free, because that ain't fair or reasonable. The world is stressful enough right now - we all need to find rest and peace where we can.

I explained to my partner that despite this couple's ""fun"" framing of this party as a brand new concept, it is in fact one of the oldest known to humanity - it's commonly known as *TAKING THE P\*SS.*

He slept on it, woke up to reality, and thankfully didn't accept the invitation. But what in the Parental Audacity Awards 2025 was this? Why and how do these people think they are entitled to ask for heavy-duty work, for free, from people they even only vaguely know? Why bring a child into the world and buy a house in need of renovation if you can't afford / refuse to pay for professional help to make it more liveable? I was horrified, reader and I still am.

I just needed to rant about it, as this one feels a bit more insidious (and hell, maybe some folks enjoy this kind of ""party"") than letting their child sing over a plane tannoy or be a douche on public transport. Parental entitlement comes in many flavours, and it gives parents who don't behave like this and take responsibility for their choices a bad name. Ugh.",23,1748777039.0,childfree,5,1.0,False

I've always leaned on friends or family when going somewhere unfamiliar, but I decided it was time to change that.

After a lot of internal pep talks and mild panic (seriously, my heart was pounding when I booked the hotel), I just went for it. The plan was pretty simple—drive to a cute little town I'd heard people rave about, enjoy a random cafe, and maybe check out an art gallery or two. I know it sounds small, but for me, it was like facing a mini dragon.

The drive was actually kind of nice. I blasted my favorite playlist, and it felt oddly freeing to be the only one deciding when and where to stop. Once there, I had to push myself to go out and do the things. My mind kept insisting on the safety of that cozy hotel bed, but I managed to step out, grabbing a coffee at this quirky cafe. 

To my surprise, I started chatting with a couple of locals who were refreshingly friendly. It reminded me how sometimes people can genuinely make a place feel more welcoming. 

Long story short, I survived the trip and even enjoyed it. I realized my comfort zone wasn't as cozy as I thought. The whole experience kinda felt like an awesome test drive for future me-time adventures.

“I got toilet paper, Veronica”. My sister Bridget holds up her 9-pack of toilet tissue proudly like she’s won some grand prize, “I almost had to kill a man to get it though, because it was the last pack on the shelf” 
  

  She laughed to herself, and I let out a sigh of relief. It had been four weeks since the pandemic hit Australia, and almost every supermarket was out, with restrictions placed on certain items. It was like the world was going crazy, and we were down to our last roll, so I was grateful.
  

  Bridget and I had been living together for the past 6 months. She moved into my small, two-bedroom flat after the breakdown of her marriage. It was a living arrangement that was only ever meant to be temporary, as I’d always lived on my own and enjoyed my own space, but the longer Bridget stayed, the more I had grown accustomed to having her here.
  I’d been pretty reclusive since high school, sure, I still made time to catch up with Bridget and our best friend, Kate, but I loved my alone time. I’d had relationships, nothing too serious, though, I’d cut and run before giving them a chance to utter those three little words. I was an expert at breaking up with men, well all except one, the one I could never let go of, he’d suck me in, time and again with his promises of change and words of sweetness but it always ended the same way and I’d be left broken and regretful once again.
  

  “Did you get the wine?” I asked Bridget, it was that she had originally gone out for, and I couldn’t see it.
  

  “Shit, sorry Roni, I got distracted, Sam called me before I got into the store and between that and the excitement over the toilet paper I just forgot” She apologised as she went to grab her keys but I wasn’t going to let her get away without an explanation.
  

  “Sam? As in that Samuel Lions?” I ask her, pointing to some trashy, tabloid magazine that she left sprawled across my coffee table, with Sam and some unknown woman kissing on the cover.
  

   The world was no stranger to seeing Sam’s face splashed across the media, he was, after all one of the worlds most top ranking soccer players, until he retired 5 years ago, but it was his lifestyle off the field that caught the attention of the paparazzi, a new girl every month, being labeled the world’s most eligible bachelor, or as Bridget liked to call him, the ultimate fuck boy.
  

  We met Sam when he was 16, a transfer student from England with a heavenly accent, which secured him instant popularity. He became best friends with Lucas and remained very loyal to that friendship, even when Sam knew that Lucas was sleeping around behind my back, and, although Sam has made many attempts to contact me over the past 21 years, I rejected him every time. It’s not that I hold a grudge against Sam, it’s just that I know He and Lucas came as a package, and it took me so long just to be free from Lucas.
  

  “Yes, Roni, Sam Lions called me, he wanted to check up on us, to see if we were alright, he does that, Veronica, he calls me often to ask how you are”
  

  “Why?” I question my sister, this is the first I’m hearing of Sam making any enquiries about me, ever.
  

  “Because you haven’t spoken to him in over 20 years, you were one of his best friends, Roni, and suddenly you cut him out like he meant nothing to you, like he was the one who cheated, not Lucas.” She explains to me, and I feel a sting of guilt. I know she’s right, I punished Sam for what Lucas had done.
  

  “He’s all the way over in England anyway so I guess it wouldn’t hurt if I messaged him, it’s not like he can come here anytime soon, not with the boarders being closed” I say, feeling the guilt ease a little, I could let Sam back in if I didn’t have to see him, or Lucas ever again, the control freak in me liked this idea.
  

  “He’s been living back here for the past three months, his dad is sick so Sam came home to take care of him and I suggested that we should catch up and I invited him over tonight he’ll be here in 20 minutes” Bridget says to me so casually, like this is the most normal occurrence, inviting a celebrity fuck boy over for catch up drinks. I grab the keys out of her hand and storm towards the door.
  

  “Where are you going, Veronica?” She calls out after me, chasing me down the flight of stairs that lead out to the street.
  

  “I’m going to get the wine because I’m going to need it, and after tonight, you and I are going to have a conversation about boundaries.” I get in my car and throw my phone into the cup holder before reversing out of our driveway and taking off down the street.
  

  I am fuming. How could she do this to me? How could she take my control right out of my hands? What if Sam brings Lucas?
  

  “Siri, call Bridget”, I command my phone, and after two rings, my sister picks up.
  

  “Roni, please don’t be angry, I’m sorry, it all just happened so quickly and I got so caught up, you know what Sam is like, he’s such a smooth talker, it’s the accent, it could charm the panties off of anyone” She talking fast, trying to come up with excuses.
  

  “Bridget, you’re gay, you have been since you were 18, so if you’re telling me that he could get into your panties, then I think that there's something you’re not telling me, what are you hiding, Bridge?” I take the corner sharply, not concentrating at all.
  

  “Well, it’s not just Sam, he’s bringing Lucas with him”, She confesses, “In fact, Sam said it was Lucas’ idea, that he wanted to see you, that he has something he wants to say to you”
  

  “Well, I have nothing to say to him,” I lie, she knows it, over the years I’ve had many fuel rage rants about the boy who used me up and spat me out.
  

  “Yes you do and you need to get it out of you Roni, as much as you say he hurt you you’re still allowing that pain to continue, to consume you and it affects every relationship that you’ve had” My sister, the guidance councillor, can never switch off from work, she always has to find a problem to solve
  

  “I can’t say it to him now, it’s been too long. I just wish I had said it to him back then, I wish I could go back and say everything I’ve wanted to say” I cry, tears pinpricking my eyes as my vision blurs.
  

  I hear the screeching of tyres, followed by the crunch of metal being twisted and my Rav4 spinning out of control as I scream, trying to turn the wheel so I can come out of the spin, but it’s too late, my car hits the telegraph pole with a massive amount of force.
  The road is silent for a brief moment, but it doesn’t last long; it’s broken by the sound of Bridget screaming my name.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfii5GuaC0k) are 2 [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbmhwPzD20) that hopefully sparks your imagination, click for the [game description](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Pocket%20Planet%20Survival%20Description.html)

After my first(commercially unsuccessful) [full project](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1if0jci/4\_years\_4000k\_hours\_800/), I want to address the most important question first, is it marketable?

The game is build around its unique, hollow planet concept with seamless in/out transitions, its something novel and also easy to sell on a short clip. Tower defense on a sphere is a innovation in the genre while building on established core gameplay loops. The controls are casual and approachable, while the incremental aspect combines longterm motivation with basically infinite progression.

I am convinced about the projects potential, I will carry it to the finish line no matter what. But I am also aware that I have a bit of a blind eye on the art side and will not achieve the level of quality that is needed to survive on a highly competitive market. Due to real life responsibilities, I can invest roughly 15 hours a week into the project. So the next logical step is, to find developers with similar ambitions and create something bigger together!

This is the [Contract](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Revshare%20Contract.html) I'm planning to use and ofc I'm willing to discuss details.

This revenue share model is surely not everyone's cup of coffee, but it offers several advantages if you believe the concept and find some trust in me :)

Who am i looking for?

Here are the planned [development Milestones](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Development%20Milestones.html). At this point, Planet Spawn, Resource collection, Unlocking Tiles with resources, mines, towers, pathfinding and leveleditor are done. I need experienced developers who can bring the project forward, if you see an area where you can bring value, we can talk. The ideal case would someone who takes the artistic lead but can also handle implementation/polishing. Pure asset creation is less useful because most assets will come from Asset-Packs.

Experience in Unity ECS is a big plus.

This makes the infinite accessible.","To solve the evolution equations, the researchers built a custom software package known as COnFormal Field Equation Evolver (COFFEE). Using COFFEE, the researchers simulated gravitational wave pulses of varying strengths encountering a Schwarzschild black hole.

The researchers tested a range of wave amplitudes, tracking how much of their energy was absorbed versus scattered when encountering the black hole.

Their simulations revealed that spacetime is exceptionally stiff.

For incoming waves having weak amplitudes, only about 8.5% of the energy scattered back to infinity, with the rest being absorbed by the black hole. Even for waves with strong amplitudes, only about 20% of the energy escaped.

To understand how much energy flows in and out during the scattering process, the researchers calculated two quantities: Bondi energy and Bondi news at both infinities.

""The Bondi news is simply a quantity that 'brings news' that there is gravitational radiation. ""Namely, if it is non-zero, there is gravitational radiation, and zero otherwise,"" explained Thwala.

On the other hand, Bondi energy is the total energy on a light cone from any point in spacetime. It is one of the few rigorous ways to define energy in general relativity.

energy conservation with remarkable precision throughout their simulations, providing crucial validation of their numerical methods.

They also observed fascinating nonlinear effects. Despite injecting simple wave patterns, the complex dynamics of curved spacetime generated additional wave modes through backreaction. This is essentially when waves create new waves as they propagate.

Most intriguingly, when outgoing radiation reached future null infinity, it exhibited characteristic oscillations known as quasinormal ringing, which is the black hole's natural vibration frequency.”

In no time, my carpet was spotless, vibrant, and odor-free. They even treated a pet stain I’d given up on! Now, my living room’s back to being my cozy haven, and I’m not embarrassed to host.

Is it too much to expect a woman value physical intimacy and sexual belonging in a relationship? 

After 3 long years, I finally ended a relationship, and honestly, I’m not okay. It felt like burying something that's already been dead for a while. But she's been insisting that we get back together and I dread just looking at her cold, neglecting face. 

I’m (30m) someone who lives through touch, through closeness and she (28f) is so cold and mean, it borders on psychopathy. Having a neglected childhood and cold parents, I thrive on deep emotional intimacy, playful physical connection, mutual vulnerability. 

I found that in my former ex this kind of beautiful connection,  a strong, consensual kink dynamic when trust allows for anything, more like a free use situation to explain it better. But in this relationship, I felt like a sensual person in a desert. I’d reach out for connection and be met with a cold shoulder. I’d suggest closeness, a cuddle, a massage, anything and get brushed off. At one point, I brought her breakfast in bed and gently touched her arm, and she actually flinched and said, “Please don’t.” It damaged my spirit so deep that I mildly started hating myself. 

She is cruel in every way. But it hurt it much quiet ways, withholding, avoiding, ignoring,  it started to feel like punishment for needing closeness. If I said I felt rejected, she’d say I was “too sensitive.” If I brought up our dead bedroom, she’d shut down and say I was pressuring her. So I stopped bringing it up. I stopped initiating. I stopped touching her. And I started feeling like a ghost in my own home.

All of this while I’m finishing my PhD (literature), completely burnt out, exhausted, living off gym, writing, sleep, and coffee. I’m also on anti-anxiety meds that have dulled me in ways I can’t fully explain. I’m emotionally flat, physically tired, and touch-starved.

now that it’s over… I’m grieving. Not just her, but the intimacy I never got. The love and connection I hoped for. The safe, wild, playful kind of connection I crave. The trust and sensuality I once knew in a past relationship a kind of closeness where touch meant everything, not just sex but safety, openness, being known.

She's begging me to stay, which doesn't make sense because soon after argument I asked her if we could go for a walk to discuss this and she said she would never spend a moment with me. That kind of push and pull has broken my heart so deep. 

 I’m still raw, and lonely, and I wonder if I’ll ever find someone who wants to meet me in that space of emotional and physical vulnerability again.

1l0m41o,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianrealestate/comments/1l0m41o/bewares_of_broker_in_gurgaon/,Bewares of broker in Gurgaon,"Guys,

I was recently looking for properties, I am seeing a pattern with multiple brokers. They are highly biased for new launches instead of re-selling the existing properties. In after explicitly asking about property in resell, they barely show interest.

**Hypothesis:**

\- Brokers has huge incentive in selling new launches due to higher commission and less effort. More effort and negotiation needed in Buyer Seller deal.

\- Many brokers work for big agencies they take units exclusively from the builders to sell and they have to meet targets.

**Disadvantage:**

*For Seller:* There will be sellers who want to sell their either to book profits or money requirement. They won't be able to do so. (Even if you have initially bought your property with same broker with promise of profit). Now they are giving long term narrative to save themselves from continuous call from seller. 

*For Buyer:* It will be really hard to find good units and market price. They always force buyers to buy property at builders price.

**Concern for investor:**

*Bull Market Scenario:* There will be many new property launches. Broker will be always be interested in selling new launches. It will make harder to liquidate the investment. As you are competing with big sales gallery and free coffee.

  
*Bear Market Scenario:* Builders have their own inventory to sell first. (Many brokers bought property by themselves for investment). Next time you meet any broker you ask about their investment you get to know. This makes again investor to get a good price for the property as demand is low.

  
Please share your PoV. I feel Gurgaon real estate market is not bubble, it is a nexus between builders and brokers. And only few investor get benefit with real estate in short term (3-5 years). Long term is might be true but they will be some what equivalent to other more liquid assets.

Jack was behind me, one step down the narrow staircase. The sun was high in the cloudless sky, and the smell of the garbage by the door filled my nose. The door opened and there was Rachel, bright-eyed and smiling. She invited us in.

It was a small, three storey house on an estate near the primary school. We walked into the living room and sat down on a couch. The three of us drank coffee and talked for a while about all the things that’d changed in the last several years. Rachel was now married; she had an eight-year-old daughter and was working part-time behind the counter of a service station a few streets away.

We soon ran out of small talk and I knew it was time to tell her about the real reason we were in town. I was considering how to bring it up without sounding like a conspiracy theorist, when Jack went ahead and beat me to it. He told her all about his social work and the case files and the lack of investigation. He said we were down here to find information about any of the missing children, and asked if she knew about anyone who had gone missing.

Earlier that morning, I called up my sister. She’s a few years younger than me, and after hearing the kid in the park the previous night, I had to learn more. I asked her, when she’d been at school in the years below me, if she’d ever heard about the Gnawbone.

It turned out she had. In fact my question came as quite a surprise to her.

“Doesn’t everyone know that old story?”

Apparently, in the years after we first heard of and went looking for the Gnawbone, it had become the most popular ghost story for kids to tell each other in the lower years. She told me the kids all used to talk about it for a while at that age, but it was generally forgotten about in the later years.

One particular memory that it brought back for my sister is a rumour she heard around age ten or eleven. One of the girls from the other school across town had supposedly disappeared and was never seen at school again. The reason, her classmates decided, was the Gnawbone. It had taken her away into the woods to eat her.

My sister said she never really believed it herself, I guess I was the only one in our family who would’ve at the time. She never did forget it though.

And then, a couple of hours later in Rachel’s living room, her eight-year-old daughter Sarah peeked her head around the doorway to the living room.

“Are you talking about Tracey?” She asked.

Rachel walked over to shoo her out of the room, but before she could, Jack said “Did you know Tracey?”

She was one of the kids he had found out about.

Sarah nodded. “I haven’t seen her since last year,” She said, “The teachers all say she moved but she didn’t say goodbye.”

Rachel just stood there looking stunned that her daughter knew someone who could’ve gone missing under suspicious circumstances. I can’t say I blame her. Jack kept on talking though, worried her mother would soon stop his questioning.

“Did Tracey ever hang out with anyone older than her?” He asked.

Sarah shook her head. “No. The other kids say something else though.”

“What do they say?” Said Jack.

“That the Gnawbone got her.”

Jack excused himself and we stepped out the front door before Rachel could process what had just happened. We walked across the street to where we parked the car. I turned the key in the ignition and pulled away onto the road. We both knew where we had to look next.

We pulled up a few minutes later by the path down Landing Lane. It was midday and it was quiet. Jack stepped out of the car and I followed suit.

“Do you think we’ll be able to find the asylum again?” Said Jack.

“Maybe, it was pretty deep in the woods. I don’t exactly remember the way,” I said.

We walked up the path and turned off down the trail to the river.

“Do you really believe it?” I asked, “I mean, that there’s a creature called the Gnawbone out here?”

“I don’t know,” Jack replied, “But I get the feeling the stories stuck around for a reason.”

The two of us followed the trail across the bridge, and turned left toward the old weir we hadn’t seen in thirteen years. It looked no different than it did back then, water trickling down the cracked concrete, between piles of twigs and dead leaves. We walked on past and into the treeline.

The woods were calm and still, no birds singing or breeze drifting through the branches. All I could hear was the sound of my footsteps over the dirt trail in time with Jack’s just ahead of me. We plodded through the woods for minute after long minute until we came to a patch Jack thought looked familiar. I wasn’t so sure, but we left the path and shoved our way through the overgrown brush.

After a long time spent tangled in long and sharp trees, we didn’t seem to be getting anywhere. We were going in a straight line, at least I thought we were, but even then, we were only kids when we came through the first time. We could easily have been going around in circles and been none the wiser.

“Are you sure this is right?” I asked Jack.

“Of course not,” He replied, “It seemed like the best shot though.”

“Maybe we should go another direction?”

We changed our heading and pushed on through endless leaves and branches, the sunlight trickling down from above not revealing much of anything. Then I heard Jack up ahead.

“Hey, I think I found it!”

I crouched under a low branch and found myself in the clearing with the row of pine trees, just how I remembered from our last trip.

“Wow, it really wasn’t a dream then,” I said.

We walked up the road and long the line of trees. I didn’t really know what to expect when we’d finally get there, or what kind of answers the old building might hold. Whatever we’d find though, I was sure would be the key to our mystery. Then I saw it, looming over the path like a shadow.

The abandoned asylum looked no different to how I remembered it. The cracked ceiling tiles and the layers of moss and the shattered windows seemed exactly as we had left them. Except for one tiny detail. Someone had written in spray paint the words: *The Pleasure Room* above the doorway.

“Was that always there?” Said Jack.

“I don’t think so,” I said.

Since there were no obvious signs of life, we walked up the steps and pushed the door open. It creaked, creaked, creaked open, the sound echoing in the room beyond. I peered through the widening gap and saw the same empty reception with the wooden desk built in to the corner. Jack and I stepped inside.

We walked up the staircase at the back of the room, having decided to start in the place we knew best. Coming out at the top, we stepped into the ward with the lines of hospital beds in either direction. I turned right, and stopped almost immediately. There again was the graffitied poem that scared us as kids.

*I walk the trees, night by night*

*I know each one by name and sight*

*I find the children all alone*

*And rip and tear and gnaw the bones*

“I’d forgotten what it said exactly,” I said, “No wonder it scared us.”

“Yeah, there must have been some messed up teenagers back then,” Said Jack.

“I hope so,” I said.

“Hey that must’ve been where the name came from, ‘*gnaw the bones’*,” Said Jack.

We turned away and paced the room looking for anything else of interest. Paint was peeling from the walls and shards of glass lay in small puddles where the afternoon sun entered. We walked past rusty hospital beds until one of them caught both of our attention at once. Jack and I rushed over to it. On each side, attached to the metal, were a pair of handcuffs.

“What the hell…?” Said Jack.

The dots were joining together for us now. The painted signs on both this building and the train cars, coupled with this was too much to brush off as nothing.

“What do we do now?” I said, “Tell the police about all this?”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Said Jack.

“Why not? You really think this is some kind of cover up?” I said.

“That’s what it looks like to me,” Said Jack.

“So what else do we do?”

“I don’t know, maybe someone out of town?”

“Maybe,” I said, “But we need more to give them, right? How do we know these weren’t here thirteen years ago?”

“I don’t remember them,” Said Jack.

“Maybe we should try Roger? He might remember if we don’t.”

“Alright, it’s a start, I guess. His old number doesn’t work anymore though.”

We walked through every other room with an eagle eye, but we didn’t find anything else of interest. Having taken photos of the graffiti and the handcuffs, we left the building and stumbled our way through the woods until we eventually made it back to the car. As I drove back to my bed and breakfast, Jack scoured the internet on his phone to find a way of contacting Roger.

“I can’t find him anywhere, no social media at all,” Said Jack.

“Anyone else who might know him?” I asked.

Jack kept on searching.

“I’ve found his dad’s business number, I could try that,” He said.

I looked across at the clock on the dashboard. It was before five.

“Try it,” I said, silently praying. Having another person helping would be a big improvement.

Jack dialled and it rang forever, but eventually someone picked up and answered. Jack didn’t spend long speaking to him, and from what I heard it didn’t go as I was hoping. Jack took the phone away from his ear and sat in silence.

“What is it? What did he say?” I said.

“He invited us to go and meet them,” Said Jack.

“Okay,” I said, “Maybe they just want us to meet in person.”

“I just realised something,” Said Jack.

“What?”

“You remember that toy giraffe we found? In the train cars?”

“Yeah?”

I picked out a few as candidates, but went to Gyokusuien... because they were closest (near Odori station). Turned out to be a great selection! Just as a note, I speak Japanese, and I was able to ask a whole lot of questions during my tea-time and get a very good education from a master!

Went in and was met by an older gentleman who turned out to be the owner. Once I made it clear I was there for tea (and not matcha ice cream or lattes or whatever the other tourists were ordering), first he asked me if I wanted sencha or matcha. I went sencha, then he asked for my taste preferences--sweeter or more bitter. I went with sweeter, grassy notes, and he picked out a local sencha from a canister (no pics or names, but I will return!). He explained he will make 3 steeps, and to pay attention to the different tastes and notes.

[Sencha, pre-steep](https://preview.redd.it/l4y0n8i2ma4f1.jpg?width=3472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8509ec4fff585661a19b721a337dff4cd87aeaf6)

1st steep was the sweetest, fairly intense. I asked for the water temp, he said around 77C, which I always thought was too hot, but he explained you can vary your temps and go for a longer steep as well. Also for pouring, he did an initial gentle pour before swishing and finishing the pour, explaining the process along the way.

At this point, I'll mention he was incredibly gracious with my questions, which in keeping with Japanese traditions, I first asked permission to ask, but still, he seemed very willing to educate me on the process, even before I asked for more details. I didn't get exact ratios or anything, but from eyeballing the process, he used quite a lot of tea to water, almost gongfu style, and maybe a 20 sec first steep.

The second steep he explained would be less sweet and more intense. Still, I wasn't quite ready for the amount of umami. The 3rd pour, which he explained would extract all the best bits of the leaves, was the longest, did a bit of swishing before pouring, and while more bitter, still very flavorful. 

[3rd and final steep, more bitter, very flavorful](https://preview.redd.it/zhe8p0zona4f1.jpg?width=3472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60b8ebc16434ef3896b6f4e883a21852e297b53a)

He said that you can do more steeps, but the best flavors, certainly anything he would serve a guest/customer, were done with. He also mentioned, you can make good ochazuke with the remnants.

Have I mentioned this service and 3 cups was ¥300? About $2 at today's rates? I would happily pay 10x that for just the conversation and education I received.

Did I buy any tea? No. Because I'm going back. He explained Hokkaido teas, young sencha available, but also some lightly aged (< 1yr, nothing like pu'er) sencha that he said I should try on another day, not right now. Oh, it'll be an increased price of ¥400! So I'll be back, and probably bring some colleagues, and absolutely stock up on some (more) tea before leaving Sapporo on Friday. Maybe I'll try some matcha too.",4,1748774817.0,tea,0,1.0,False

I was dating a single mum with 2 children.  She had 2 divorces. The first marriage they both cheated, the second marriage they had 2 children but grew apart due to emotional distance according to her. She said her ex was emotionally detached and  neglected her for the final 2 years. She is earning £30-45k - never found out how much, and has a house with a mortgage. She comes from a broken family, mum is in the UK, dad is in Russia and her brother is a drug addict from what she told me. 

***Natallia is NOT her real name.*** 

I am a single doctor, earning £150k+ a year. No divorce, no kids, family oriented with a strong family network.

  
This was a 2 year relationship. 





***Children***

Natalia had 2 children - 8 and 5. The 5 year old had clear ADHD traits and was extremely high maintenance. Both were very loving, very caring. The 8 year old was more slightly more cautious but still very outgoing. 



With the children, I was amazing with them but I always have been. I have 15 younger cousins. I love playing with them when I was younger. As a doctor, I did paediatrics so I’d always be   doctor playing around, asking kids their favourite dessert and super hero and making jokes with 5 year olds about how they need to cook for their parents in the evening (and pretended to be shocked they’ve done never done it before). 



I made a huge effort with the kids. I’d bring them stone samples from my parents granite business because they liked stones. 

I’d always talk tot hem on the phone for up to half an hour or longer. How are they? How are their hobbies? How was school? What are they up to? They’d FaceTime and show me things they’ve done, I’d have a laugh and joke about them. I know loads about them from the fact they like Minnions, which ones they want, their favourite films, favourite foods, favours desserts, where they’d like to go, favourite TV shows.

I’d also find video games we could complete together. 

I also sometimes helped with them with their homework. 



When they visited my house, I made sure I had video games for both children (one likes more action focussed games, one likes Peppa pig). I made sure to have films for them too, their favourite foods and breakfast items. I also put in my car video games consoles so they could play them in the back. 



Upon breakup, Natalia told me ‘you only saw my kids every 6 months’. This was dishonest, a lie, and a punch to the gut. 

She did say I was very good with kids (her friends all remarked on it from when we went to the park with some sense of wonder and jealousy as the dads were either absent or very withdrawn from playing with the kids) - Natalia said it was nice BUT it almost felt like I was their friend rather than an adult. This hurt me as it took effort. 



In terms of activities we did:

1. Went to Monkey Park
2. Went to Bonfire night
3. Went to Halloween
4. Went to an activity park
5. Baby sat them and took them out to eat
6. Countless times sat with them, watching films int he house playing games
7. 2x Christmas events - which involved watching the kids dance and sing with a loud microphone
8. School play - going to a very long school music/play/dance thing for 3 hours
9. Taking them to Ninja warrior 3 times 
10. Spending New years with them - organising food, champagne, a film, 
11. Having them stay over  at my place for a BBQ 
12. Having them stay over at mine for a wood fired pizza 
13. Having them over for what was an epic water fight and water games at the house 
14. Went to a large park by my house multiple times
15. Went to a large park by their house multiple times 
16. Both of their birthdays



I bought them Christmas gifts, birthday gifts and I used to buy the other child gifts on the other birthday so they didn’t feel missed out. 



For all of the above Natalia only paid for Monkey Island

Natalia did mention on breakup ‘I finally took them to the water park by myself which I’d asked you to organise for ages’. I sadly had no energy to argue and said  s lovely. 

Another punch to the gut. 



Overall with her kids - I felt I tried so so so hard and I performed so well because I’m so good with kids, But ultimately it was completely under-appeciated and for nothing. 





***Having Children & Marriage***

Natalia already had two children so having further kids was a complex discussion. She had already been married twice.



Initially during the start of the relationship she said she didn’t want more children. However at the 6 month mark when I told her my idea of a family, she said she felt sh would like a child with me potentially as she never had the level of support and love during her pregnancy she felt I described and would potentially provide. 



However, at the 9 month mark she did mention maybe not wanting kids or it not being a priority for her. 



Multiple times, Natalia did explain she didn’t want to get married. We’d walk passed Lichfield Cathedral or a couple getting married and she’d say she didn’t want it. 



When we finally broke up, she said she wanted someone who she could get married and have children with. She realised seeing her ex-partner move on and have a new child, it’s what she’s always wanted. When I challenged this - saying its something I wanted but she didn’t during the relationship, she said I never made her feel safe to do so maybe  s why she gave me the answer she did. 



This left me upset, but also a little confused. It was as if the goal posts were always being moved. 





***Money***

In regards to money, I paid for nearly everything for the entire relationship. 

Natalia explained to me in her previous relationships, they were always ‘traditional’ in   the man paid for everything for her. She did however later state her partner made her work in a pub, and her ex-partner (who is the father of their kids) since their separation is very strict with money - they even split the money for children’s shoes and school uniform. Therefore something doesn’t seem consistent there. 

I paid for taxis, food, holidays, restaurants, trips, exclrcusions and this included things for her and if her children were present, things for her children. 

Natalia would paid for a T-shirt in Spain, a ticket to a water park, a sandwich in Spain, a few drinks and some christmas/birthday presents she bought me. The Christmas and birthday presents were never of equivalent value, although I didn’t expect this either. 



I estimate I spent around £45,000 during our relationship for us. She definitely spend under £1,000. 



She did pay once for me.  It was the first time I met her children properly. It was a monkey farm (really for kids). She said a few months after she had paid for it, she felt it was unpleasant - citing she felt like I was a ‘third child’ when she paid. 



When I brought up finances, she felt I didn’t spend enough. Specifically presents for her. She also explained   she felt what I essentially did is ‘put food on a plate’. The words she used were ‘thank you for putting food on a plate’. 



There were some situations which were difficult. For example, if we were to go to town to eat - the taxi there and back is around £90. The cost of the meal was already fairly high at around £100-£200. I couldn’t drive at the time, and it was always a meal she wanted, but she’d be very frustrated and annoyed if she did have to drive and at times would ask for her not to (which meant me paying for the taxis). 



There was also a situation where, after I’d learnt to drive, I was hesitant to drive to a car park as my car was slightly large, expensive and I wasn’t used to driving it. It was Ninja warrior, a place I’d booked for her and her children for New Years. She refused to drive, and was happy for me to book a taxi for us to get there and back. I did later ask her why she didn’t offer  to drive and she said she ‘wanted to feel like I have taken care of her and got her somewhere’. She also stated it was a means of ‘teaching me a lesson and she wouldn’t feed my fear of not driving’. I explained I was just learning to drive in a much larger car than I’d passed my test on and it was only 1 month since I’d passed my test. By the 2-3 month mark, I was driving very confidently everywhere. 



In one of the arguments we had near the end of the relationship, she did say ‘I’ve realised you don’t like to give presents’. I tried to explain   when you pay for absolutely everything, it’s difficult to find money, time and energy to pay for and find presents.



There was also an incident at a gym. My sister noticed there was a £2 bottle of water. Natalia called me over to pay for the bottle of water. My sister found this very strange given the small sum of money. 



When Natalia would damage her car from driving, she would ask me for money to cover or help her with this. This became frustrating after a while. There was an incident at New years, where I had paid for Christmas presents for her and her 2 children, arranged a New years event at my house and paid for everything there, and then when driving into my house she’d slightly scraped her car on a wall. She was upset and angry I didn’t offer to pay for the repair. By this point, I felt drained. 



There was an incident where I’d had a busy day at work. I came back, Natalia was staying over. She’d been working all day in the house. I played some music, cut a salad, got out 3 steaks I’d bought for the night and salted, seasoned and prepared them for what I thought would be a nice meal. I thought to get a bottle of wine and relax. Natalia came out of the room, stating she wasn’t happy, had been in the house all day and wanted to go out. I said okay but I’ve prepared the food. She said she just wanted to go somewhere. We got in her car, and she drove to the closest shopping centre - a shop called River Island. There, I was very disinterested. I didn’t want to be there, I didn’t feel like buying clothes for myself and to be honest, I had at this point low self esteem about how I feel and look. I just wanted to relax and unwind. Natalia ran around the store, looking at clothes, then trying to get me to try some on. However, I was tired and only there for her. I just wanted to get back. I sat down. She wondered around, then eventually she paid for a dress and left. When she left the store, she asked if I knew she was at the checkout and   I was going to get the dress? I said I did. She then got very angry, stating why didn’t I pay for it, why didn’t I get her a present and   my behaviour was embarrassing. I explained   if I am to get her a gift, I don’t wish to be dragged to the store to get one when I wanted to relax. She was deeply upset at this point, stating it was horrible behaviour from me and   I wasn’t taking responsibility, wasn’t caring for her and I was making her feel unhappy and under valued. 





***Dragging things out of me*** 

A common theme and phrase Natalia would use is whatever I have done in the relationship, it had to be ‘dragged out of me’. She said she felt exhausted having to drag things out of me. She explained if it wasn’t for her ‘dragging things’ out of me, we would not have gone on holidays, we would not have had nice experiences and I would not be taking responsibility.  This hurt as it re-framed everything positive I had given in the relationship as if it was something I didn’t do but she instead did or had to force out of me. 







***Phone call*** 

At a point in the relationship, Natalia started trying to put pressure on me to advance buy career. For perspective, she was near the entry point to her career earning 35-50k a year. I am a fully qualified senior doctor earning £100k to £150k a year. I was far further in career progression than her. 



I remember vividly driving to work, enjoying my day. She phoned, had a nice conversation but then asked if I’d made any progress with some of my business ideas. I said I’m going to work but not at the moment (it was quite tough with her weekly or monthly demands in a different direction). She said ‘if I ever wanted a family or to be able to support one, I’d have to come up with ideas to bring in more money or otherwise I couldn’t’. This specific comment was the first one where I did bite back, fairly bluntly explaining I’m at a senior level and above most people in the country in terms of earnings and as I stand, I absolutely can afford and support a family. 



This was a strange conversation. She did backtrack a little but I wasn’t sure if she was trying to motivate me because I had to also support her two children, herself and my potential kids or if she was just so deluded in terms off how low she saw me,   the thought I was someone   needed to sort their life out. 



For perspective, I owned a 110,000 car, I own my own house worth £700,000 and live in it myself, I earn £100,000-150,000 a year as a senior doctor, I have a very supportive family and I have a decent amount of money in the bank as an emergency fund alongside a home cinema in my house, a home gym, an outdoor kitchen and a few luxuries which I’m proud, but not satisfied with,. 





***Co-op***

I once went to visit her, which at the time involved me paying £60 in an uber fee for an evening. I arrived at her house, she had her 2 kids. I sat in her lounge, playing with the kids, talking to her. She seemed like she’d had a slightly busy day. I’d had a busy day too and made the effort of the 1 hour commute and paying £60 to sit in her modest house with her 2 kids when I have my own much larger nicer house to sit in. I hadn’t eaten. I did mention it to her. She essentially said to me to walk to co-op and buy something. I did just this. I couldn’t drive at the time so I walked in the cold, in an area I didn’t know. She asked me to also buy her some beers. I drank one beer whilst walking back with this oven pizza, thinking this is such an awful life to live. I felt very de-meaned and disrespected. I made the effort to visit her and she just told me to ‘walk to co-op’. 



I explained this to her. She said as a man, I should be coming to her and asking her if she needs any food shopping and to come to the house with the food. I should be coming to her house with a bottle of wine or offering her something as opposed to just sitting there. She also said as a man, you should do things and make things happen if you want them rather than just sitting in my house like a princess. 



A week later, a similar situation happened when she was in my bedroom. She said do you have any coffee? We’d ran out and I don’t drink coffee. I said no and said you can drive to co-op or Starbucks and get some. She got extremely angry. I explained I’m just giving her the same answer she gave me last week. She could not easily cope with this situation and got very angry, and again played on gender roles and how it’s different for a man and woman. 



For me, I just wanted care and respect. ‘Are you hungry? Don’t worry, I can make you something or order you something in’. ‘Thank you for coming. I know you could be doing anything at this moment in time but you’ve decided to travel to see me, spending lots of money in the process and I know I can’t offer you much given I am a single mum with two children’. I didn’t even want her to say this, I just wanted some recognition of the effort I was going to but instead I felt almost as if I had imposed myself on her, despite being the one telling me to come and visit her. 





**Spa**

I remember booking a luxury spa for her. It was a treatment and evening Spa stay. I couldn’t drive at the time so I’d arranged with her   she comes to my house at 5PM and we go together. Natalia and got her timing entirely wrong and was running late. She phoned me stating she was running late. I’d already paid £150 for the spa. She said she can come and pick me up but we will be late and both miss the treatments, or she could go straight there and then I could make my own way there. It was rush hour, there was no available ubers so me getting there was going to be difficult. It was also another additional expense. I’d already paid for the spa, I was going to pay for the drinks and food there too and now an additional taxi fare felt like the straw breaking the camels back. There was also no way I could get there on time given the traffic. 



I did give her a choice - because I expected her to say ‘No, I wish to come with you and we go together’. However her answer was ‘I’ll go directly there and meet you’. When I got there eventually, she had already had her treatment and was in the hot tub relaxing. I’d obviously missed my treatment. 



I was angry, frustrated, disappointed. I explained the situation, and eventually she apologised. 



However I could tell there was some underlying resentment probably to do with my time of the lack of being able to drive.



I remember getting on really well with her children. I am exceptionally good with kids, not sure how or why but I find playing with the very natural. However with her kids, I made an additional effort to always stay engaged, talk to them properly and on their level and take a real interest in them. I'd give them gifts when I could, special granite stones, talk to them on the phone etc. Natalia once mentioned after this effort I put in, 'you are really good with children. Really really good but you're almost like a friend to them, rather than an adult or father figure'.





**Halloween & Alton Towers**

Natalia has suggested we do something for Halloween. I’d said I’m open to anything. However, being busy and not having kids myself - I wasn’t sure what she meant. Eventually she explained she wanted Alton towers. She didn’t book it. We had an argument as she said I should book and pay for it. She has mentioned it lots of times and I’m just dismissing her wants and needs. I explained   she can arrange things sometimes too,   I don’t have children so I don’t know much about booking alton towers or what they’d enjoy and to be frank, even if I had kids, I’d probably leave it to my wife to book these events as I’m always quite busy with work. I was always open to coming with them and being present. Following the argument, I eventually ended up booking the Halloween event to co-incide with Bonfire night so we enjoyed it together. 



I paid for everything, including the food and Pizza afterwards where they stayed the night at my house. During the day, one of her children is quite naughty. She is lovely but will cry, moan and have outbursts if she doesn’t get what she wants. I remember there was a Firework display, her 2 children were bored at this point but Natalia wanted to see the fireworks. They wanted to go home. We stayed until we’d seen the fireworks as Natalia wanted to see them but I never understood why. I enjoy fireworks but it wasn’t enjoyable when one child was screaming, crying, running off - I just feel it wasn’t enjoyable with this. However she was fairly firm   she wanted to see them. 





***Natallia seeked therapy***

She seeked therapy at one point. I suggested couples therapy but she wanted it by herself. The therapist told she was:

1. A narcissist (a diagnosis rarely given in private therapy)

2. She was the abusive person int he relationship 

3. She was obsessive with what the wanted and used what she didn't get to illustrate a lack of self worth 

  
I remember she told me this, us both sitting on a couch. I hugged her, kissed her, reassured her everything will be okay and we'll work through it. I never once thought about my own well being. 

  
Strangely, after we broke up and I replayed this situation to her - I used it as evidence I did not respect myself. She re-wrote history, saying her therapist said I was manipulative too. Once again, she tried to deny me closure.  She kind of accused me of being manipulative and lying- but I know the truth, I know what she said to me on the couch,  it was a fairly long conversation where she did have a true moment of weakness and honesty with me. I remember seeing her in pain, and I didn't care about myself, I just didn't want her to feel bad. 

  
***My physical decline and insidious depression***

At the start of the relationship, I was muscular, fairly lean, always well dressed. 

By the end of it, I was overweight, stopped going to the gym, used to dress in odd socks and strange clothes and unkempt. I was depressed without realising it.

Food wise, I used to not eat Monday to Wednesday properly as I had to eat out with Natallia week. It was expensive spending £200-400 every week on eating out & luxury groceries so I'd self neglect for half the week to be able to afford the second. If we'd split the bills at some point, it would have been easy. 

Friend and family noticed but didn't link it with depression.

Natallia noticed too - but didn't care. She'd actually laugh about it and say 'I bet this is the first proper meal you've had all week' when we'd eat together. She also sometimes would say as a man, you don't need to care about what you look like but how your woman does.

I remember I wanted a special mattress to help sleep and she said 'if you want to sleep better, just buy me a few designer bags -  s the key to life'. 

I'm now recovering since breakup physically and mentally though. 



***Holidays***

Holidays were always a contentious part of our relationship. We both enjoyed them, but Natalia saw them as a necessity. Something which needs to be done 2-3 times a year. She’d explain its for a break, because she doesn’t like England, its refreshing, to experience different cultures, to build memories and she believed the most deepest memories were built in these moments. 



For me, I really loved holidays but they aren’t a necessity. I priories building my house, renovating it, work, family and making sure you’re investing into long term future and savings so if a family member did need financial help, I’d be in a position to assist them. Also if I want kids and part of   does involve having a foundation. I also have high-cost commitments which require upkeep. 



Our first holiday was to Greece. Natalia had asked a few times to go on holiday. However she wanted me to pay for everything. I had a temporary down-turn in earnings which meant I was stressed and it wasn’t a priority for me. However eventually I agreed to go and pay for everything. I did ask she helped out financially a bit to ease the pressure, whether it’s a contribution or when we’re there. I was determined and did express   surely the cost of a holiday cannot financially cause me huge problems long term. When on holiday, Natalia did not pay for or contribute towards anything. No meal, no drink, no hotel, no activity. She cited she had a recent car bill and repair, and she believed our discussion on her helping out was in reference to the next holiday, not this one. For me, it was frustrating as she’d clearly spend £10-20 with her friends out for coffee or lunch, but wouldn’t even spend   when we were in Greece. She’d sometimes use her children as an excuse ‘If I were to pay for a meal here, I could use   to buy Sophia and Charlie a present or toys or food’. I felt like it was layers upon layers of guilt trips in situations which would be difficult for me to argue. I’d already paid for the holiday, and I loved her, so I let it slide. 



When we got to Greece initially, she did frustrate me because I had arranged transfers (they were within the price of the holiday via coach) and she was not happy about this, citing if she’d known, she would have paid for private transfers/taxis. In reality, I’d have done the same but didn’t realise it was an option. 



Booking the holiday, I did pay more for a luxury room. When doing excursions, I always had to plan ahead. For example, I’d love to book a private boat. But it was £300 per person. Instead I ended up still paying £300 but for 2 separate tickets on a normal boat. If she had chipped in and gone 50/50, we could have done things a lot more towards her liking. Every meal and restaurant was her choice. I remember one evening I really wanted some Greek Wagyu steak, but she wanted seafood for our anniversary, so we went for seafood instead. 



She did later on in an argument cite   the holiday was unpleasant due to me mentioning it to her, and she felt she needed to ‘drag’ everything out of me. It made me feel very sad, as I thought the holiday was a loving memory but she painted it as something very toxic and horrible. 



Natalia did go on a holiday partly paid by her friend with her mum for Christmas. Her friend is a rich footballer’s wife. 



Then 7-8 months later, she wishes to go on holiday again. My finances had somewhat normalised so I agreed to go to Mallorca. I paid for flights and hotels. When we got there, I still paid for most of everything. Natalia paid for a t-shirt, a sandwich and tickets to a water park which I was thankful for. However on the first day of the holiday, she was very upset and gave me silent treatment for hours because I didn’t carry her bag. She was upset my bag was easier to carry than hers. Logistically, it was difficult and sometimes impossible to carry two bags. Given I’d paid for the flights, hotel, meals, taxis to get to the hotel - I found it very frustrating. She later semi-apologised. 



On the balance of things, I found this holiday easier to digest but it was still very unfair financially. However I assumed Natalia had a difficult financial situation so it was fine (despite the fact she had gone on a holiday previously without me, but I had to assume her mum paid for everything).



Months passed and we continued to have arguments. We had some near-breakups. One  of the pivotal moments was one morning, Natalia woke up and said ‘I want to got Mexico’. I said it’d be lovely but given I’m self employed and get paid a day rate, I wouldn’t able to at the moment as I have to look after my bank balance after the months of poor financial earnings which was stressful last year and I need to build an emergency fund. However I’d be open to a trip. 



Natalia said this traumatised her as she felt I’d prefer to ‘look after my bank balance’ than look after her. She was deeply upset by this for weeks. 



Eventually, we broke up. The next week, we got back together. I caught a taxi to her house, took her out to eat and was made up. 

The week after, she came to visit me. I felt this was a process of rebuilding or connection and loving each other again naturally. The week after this, she phoned me and said ‘I’ve booked a holiday with my friend to Rome’. She did this without asking me. I was upset and did say ‘So the money you would’ve contributed to our holiday is now gone?’. This left me covering the entire bill of the holiday again fundamentally. I also didn’t think it was fair behaviour not even ask me. Natalia said it was my fault she booked the holiday because the came to my house the week before and I didn’t mention a holiday. However the reasoning from my perspective is we had broken up and just gotten back to normal - my priority was trying to rebuilt the relationship and re-establish comfort and love as opposed to a new adventure. 



This situation did upset me as the holiday at a minimum would have cost £1,000. This was a punch to the gut as it was a wake up call she did have money and wasn’t as poor as I thought she was. She was expecting the to pay for everything for her like a wife, but then do her own thing whenever she wanted. She said my reaction was unhealthy and should have been ‘I am so happy you are going on holiday, do you need any spending money’ and ‘I am so excited you are going on holiday and I want to take you on holiday, are you free the month after or the month after   to do so and I’ll pay for most or all of it as you deserve it’. 

  
She also always said a real man would have taken her and her kids on holiday and paid for everything. My sister found it strange Natalia would go on holiday to Italy by herself and not take her kids. I defended Natalia saying it'd be too expensive - my sister said you'd just go on holiday with your kids but go to a cheaper place. She felt a true mother who wanted family focused holiday would sacrifice her personal excursions and go to a less luxurious place but spend the time with her kids. 



***Granddad’s death***

When Natalia came back from her holiday with her friend, my Granddad was dying. The week after she came back, rather than come and see me, she went to a dance party in the same city I live. It was a Friday. She messaged me at 8PM saying she’s in Birmingham. My granddad was dying at the time so I was nursing him and visiting his house. I didn’t bother to argue when she told me this, then she phoned me, explaining she is having fun and how am I. At 11PM I got upset and said this entire relationship is just simply strange. Its strange my granddad is dying, its strange she is not here for me, its strange she is in the same city as me, its strange she went on holiday with her friend without asking me.  



At 1AM, my granddad did die. I went over to the house, paid my respects and went back home. Me and Natalia were still messaging and I was frustrated. I explained to her   he passed away. She said ‘sorry for your condolences for you and your family. This hurt me, as I felt she should have phoned or said something a lot more personal and emotional. We had been in a relationship for 2 years and the most she could muster was a sentence or two over text message. She said the reason she didn’t say more is because I’d get angry and turn it into an argument.  The next day, she didn’t phone me. I had to phone her at around 1-2PM and I decided to just try and be nice to end the friction and argument, as I had too much going on with arranging the funeral for my granddad. 



Whilst dealing with funeral arrangements and family grieving process - we had arguments over the phone. For me, this was hard. I was sad over the loss of someone, had daily family obligations to be present with family, had to go to work and then in the evenings had arguments and toxicity over the phone. She ended the relationship, citing I don’t make her happy and I haven’t done enough for her. The day before the funeral, she phoned and we had one of the worst telephone conversations of my life. At one point, I even said ‘if we need to part ways, can’t we do it with some love, empathy and on good terms. I haven’t cheated, I’m going through a tough time and we haven’t directly hurt eachother’. She however was relentless and cold - citing my inadequacies as a partner, how it made her feel, how I’m not a man and generally not caring I had his actual funeral the day after. It was a sore, traumatic conversation.



The next day at the funeral, I felt completely healed in terms of I was in a huge room with all my family members. 200-300+ people attended my grand fathers funeral and I had to write a speech for him. In   room, full of all the people who did genuinely loved me, I felt a second life come to me. I felt tranquil. I sent her a fairly long message saying good bye. Explaining how much I cared for her, how special she was, wishing her the best luck in the future. In hindsight, this was probably a mistake but felt right at the time. It wasn’t a letter to reconcile in hindsight, it was a eulogy, just like I was doing for my grand dad. 



A day later, she responded. She did keep phoning, and eventually wanted to make it work. At one point on face time, she cried saying ‘why do I keep phoning you’. 



We got back together. I had house rennovation work at my house. It meant her coming over was difficult - but she also never really offered to or wanted to come over. Now I could drive, it felt like she was always testing me to make the 1 hour commute to see her. I did just this.



Once in 5 weeks, she offered to come to my house. This was become she had some job instability and felt lonely. I had construction work going on so explained she can, but it was very last minute and she wouldn’t enjoy it because of the construction work. I couldn’t stop the construction work, start cooking steak and lobster etc. The bed sheets were dirty, full of dust (part of my self neglect) - She said it’s fine, I’ll bring a bed sheet. I found this very endearing, and said don’t worry. I’ll drive to you tommorow at 6PM, then spend the  evening with you, then drive back at 6AM to meet the builders here at 7AM. This is the last time I’d ever see her. 



***The last meal***

I got to her house after a long shift at work. Parked up. Went into the house. She was not ready. She was still showering - not a huge deal. I waited for her to get changed. I did try to hug her and initiate some form of intimacy. She cuddled slightly but was more focussed on going out to eat.  I thought she’d cook or prepare something, but no, nothing. She never thanked me for coming all this way simply because she ‘felt lonely’ despite the fact I had work and building commitments. I was literally driving 2-3 hours, to spend 2-3 hours with her. We went out for a meal, holding hands. It felt nice, I felt at home again, it was always just natural with her. We got to the restaurant - Italian place. There weren’t many other places close to her and it was late. We ordered the most expensive steak they had, as we always did. During the meal, some younger attractive girls came in, quite tipsy and dressed presumably to go clubbing. She got a little triggered by this, didn’t like how loud they were, was being quite bitchy about them and at one point she accused me of looking at one of them. 



She said ‘you can look at her, I look too’. I didn’t look because I genuinely didn’t care (and also it’d look really weird if I started glancing at a random girl). She pressed on this for a good 5 minutes, which is actually a very long time.  I was exhausted by the end of the meal. Then the cheque came. Obviously no offer of her to pay. Why would there? There’s been 200+ meals and I’ve paid for all of them. I thought maybe he fact I drove all the way here, on a whim, because she was lonely… there’d be something. But no. I paid. We left. I didn’t even mean to not hold her hand but for the first 2-3 minutes we just walked. She got angry and asked why I’m not holding her hand. I did on the way back. It was probably a mixture of exhaustion, embarrassment from how rude she was about those girls just trying to enjoy the meal and the fact I’ve once again paid for something I didn’t want. 



We got back. We watched a film in her bedroom on a very tiny TV, and fell asleep. No sex, no intimacy. I woke up, cuddling her, trying to subtly engage some form of intimacy. She seemed tired. I didn’t want to force or put pressure on the issue. I had to get home for the builders. I got up, got dressed. At the bottom of the stairs she came down to say goodbye. I was fed up. I’d driven hours to basically come over to someone who said they were lonely,  pay for their meal at an expensive restaurant, get minimal to no affection, they make minimal to no effort, then rush back to my house in the morning.



On the drive back, I nearly got into a car accident. God knows how I didn’t crash. I did phone her to tell her - of course she didn’t care. 

***Breakup*** 

She didn’t make an effort in the next 1-2 weeks to meet up, citing very small things which really don’t contribute towards being busy. We had a series of events coming up. Her birthday. My birthday, an easter break potentially with the kids and a holiday. It was a good £3-4k worth of money I needed to spend in advance as for my birthday, I had to pay for the dinner etc.  I thought it was best at this point to address the longer term issues of compatibility. I phoned her, as she didn’t seem bothered driving (again seemed to be keeping score cards on me making effort) - She said on the phone very bluntly ‘if we discuss this over the phone, we’ll break up. If we discuss this in person, there is a chance and can work out’. She said this as a threat. I discussed it on the phone because these were important issues. She got angry, I got frustrated at her lack of any compromise. We agreed for for some distance and to part ways. 



I phoned her a couple of days later, explaining we both clearly have issued and need to heal. We can see where we’re at with some space and if we can re-connect or work something out. She was very blunt - it’s over and I think you have the wrong impression. I understood at this moment. However I always felt if we were to finally break up - we should meet to say goodbye. 



We did talk, and I did express   I wish her and her children the best. I explained I hope she finds someone who is patient with her kids as they have very big hearts and are very loving. I also hoped she didn’t fall in the trap of being used for sex for people for a couple of months then discarded as a single mum, as for me she is so much more than  . This wasn’t emotional manipulation on my behalf - it was my true wishes even until the end. Some people would probably see her as a sex object but even to this day, I think she is far more than   and I don’t want her to be mis treated. Similarly I don’t want her children to go through a revolving door of men. 



When we broke up, I requested to meet face to face. Natalia refused, stating it would be too painful for her to see me and she can only see me once she has come to terms with we can never be together. I explained I wanted to meet her, hug her, say goodbye to her, let he know face to face how much I cared for her and thank her for what she’d provided me during the relationship. Maybe have a final steak together and make a salad but be at peace. Of course there are some things I’d have loved to do which I can’t - a final hug, a final kiss, to make love or feel each other for a final time. For me, there was still no hatred. This was someone I cared about the most in the world despite what we’ve been through and I wanted to make sure I was there for her, make sure she heals and make sure the door was open if she needed anything. 



Of course there would come a time when she dates again or I date again,   we’d have to have huge distance but int he immediate breakup - I wanted it to be peaceful. 



However, she said no. She didn’t want to meet face to face to say goodbye. She said various reasons but the bottom line for me is for a 2 year relationship to end over a phone call gave me the wakeup call I needed. She didn’t care. We never did meet face to face again. 



***Her Ex moving on***

In the background, her ex moved on. He led a happy life, traveled, met a nice Spanish girl and had a child with her. Bought a house and now living together This was the ex she said was not family oriented.

He was very strict splitting money with Natalia for the kids - at the time I thought he was stingy but in hindsight, I think he was just setting boundaries with Natallia as he still took the kids on holidays etc. 



***Respect***

There was a final phone conversation. It was a nice pleasant one. 



However a contentious point came up. She said she realised upon seeing her ex partner (who’d bought a new larger house and had a new child with his new girlfriend), she always wanted children and to get married. This was hammer blow to me. She’d always said she did not want kids or to get married. She was moving goal posts, and blaming it on me. I realised even in breakup, she was trying to make me feel inadequate and move goals. 



She said a very strange comment to me: ‘You are obsessed with respect and people respecting you, you shouldn’t look for this from the universe or even seek respect’. I realised how far apart we are and how easily she can try to warp situations. I was asking for simple reciprocal respect.







I’m finally out of it now. 

You love the person but you need to learn to love yourself more.

1l0m0gi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0m0gi,Need advice on starting,"I’m 28, M, 5’8, 183lb. Been experiencing some ED since March and told my doctor. I was hoping the Dr would prescribe viagra or something but after recent bloodwork, Dr. suggested TRT 200 mg injections weekly and Anastrozle 1mg. I’m a bit skeptical if I need this. 

I attributed the ED to chronic stress related to being in a doctoral program; additional stress in the past 1.5 years included loss of a family member and a car accident that forced me into PT for 5 months. Recently graduated but still been feeling fatigue in general. Mentally, I’m doing okay now, just bouts of sadness/depression comes daily. Anxiety is not as frequent anymore since graduating. I have a history of insomnia- not being able to fall asleep since I was in high school. As I got older, my mind continues to race and I find it harder to regulate sleep for normal hours. Typically sleeping at 5am average and waking up at 12pm. Sleep quality is fair, never waking up at night and I feel alright waking up. I am currently taking sleeping meds, but they tend to not work after a few weeks and I get a new prescription to start- been on doxepin, hydroxizine, zolpidem, and now zaleplon. I also have diagnosed ADHD and was on a medication (atomoxetine) for it during grad school, I am no longer on the meds by choice.  

Also have a history of anxiety/depression/SI from ages 19-22, and was on other meds at the time to treat it. None of them really worked. The anxiety/depression picked up again once I started my doctoral program at 25. Was also on meds for it, and it also didn’t last long. Currently still taking gabapentin 300mg for anxiety as needed. I take one of these before bed to calm me down. Also in counseling since 19 seen them weekly and have alternated between 6 therapists since. 


I’ve been working out more from ages 24-28. Probably worked out 3-4 months and then take a month off. Probably average 3 gym days a week. Doing lifting (back, arms, legs, skip chest- 6 workouts 3-4 sets) and mild walking (3.0 on incline) on treadmill for 30mins at the end of my workouts. I haven’t really noticed any real gains. I’ll lose weight and have some muscle but wouldn’t say I became fit. Diet could be better, I wouldn’t say I eat the cleanest but I’m mindful about everything I put into my body- aim for high protein (shakes, meats, 100g), eat my salads and fruits, cut out unnecessary carbs like rice/pasta. I do consume a fair amount of sugary drinks daily (coffee or a soda). My water intake could be a lot better, maybe 34 oz a day. I no longer consume as much alcohol anymore, probably 1/month . I used to drink a lot during undergrad (weekend binges) to the point my liver enzymes were elevated. 

Supplements wise: l-arginine (1000mg), one a day vitamin, ashwaganda/zinc/l-theanine complex. Will take creatine for a couple weeks and then stop for a few weeks and restart again. Some apple cider vinegar gummies. Been consistent with these the past 10 months. 

Anyways, what are your thoughts? Is the Dr recommendation good? Or should I not start? If I start, what can I start expecting mood wise, training wise, sleep wise? Side effects? I personally suspected my poor sleep habits and stress have caused my low T,  but it also sounds like low T can also impact sleep. So not sure which came first. I really just want to start feeling normal again, maybe where I was at age 23 (was working 2 jobs 5 days a week, 16 hour days, and was still able to go out on the weekends).

Since pretty much always, I've just been super tired all the time. Not just regular tired from staying up all night, or spending hours working out or doing strenuous activity, I mean waking up tired, and not feeling fully awake for about 90% of the day. Even when I was younger I would take hour naps after elementary school, middleschool, and highschool. All of my teachers have always had nice things to say ahout me, but all of them always mention that I am lethargic, since I used to take naps in pretty much any class I could. Covid was the worst, because I would log onto class, set my alarm and go to bed. On days when we were introducing going back in person, I would skip class to go to the bathrooms and log in online with my phone, pretending like I was sick but still there so I wouldn't lose my attendance. Like I'm not even kidding I would regularly fall asleep sitting in the school bathrooms just so I could feel more rested

I have been getting it looked into, but I've found very little luck. I have tried the usual methods recommended to me, including:

-coffee/energy drinks 
•	⁠those 5 hour energy shot things 
•	⁠trying to find the ""right"" amount of hours of sleep for my personal needs (no amount works) •	⁠sleeping until I'm not tired anymore (after 17 hours i decided to ditch that method) •	⁠vitamin b12
 •	⁠iron pills 
•	⁠exercise/little exercise 
•	⁠healthy/varying diets 
•	⁠varying stress levels

and have recently been taking thyroid medication, but after 2 years of no results, I have strayed from this path as well. My blood tests are almost completely normal aside from the slightly abnormal thyroid level. after at least all of these methods, I've been as tired as I was before trying them, if not more. I do have rare days where that feeling of being tired doesn't hit as much, but that's usually for days when I'm too busy or too focused on something to realize how tired i actually have been. I've kind of always been this way of just being exhausted, but after 19 years of having everything i do in all aspects of my life being hindered by just being tired, I am getting to a point. I am not currently taking any medications or diagnosed with anything other than psoriasis, but i doubt that's related. No vitamins, just taking life as naturally as I could possible be doing right now

I by no means have no complaints about where I am in life, and am doing considerably well. I've been a tattoo artist for the past year and a half, I have a car, a wonderful partner and am moving out in a couple weeks, but I know I'm not excelling as much as I could be if I wasn't so exhausted (getting chores done, wasting time with 1.5-3 hour naps a day after getting home, procrastinating on projects because I'm just too tired to do good quality work, being absolutely worn out after work because all my energy was used and I can no longer do much else with my day).

If anyone has any advice on what else I can do, that would be great. Going to the doctor hasn't really been useful when my only symptom is just ""consistent and unfixable tiredness"", along with nothing else. If you have any other questions, I'm sure I've forgotten something so feel free to ask. Appreciate any words

quick add on: I have used an apple watch that my mom has had for the past little while, my sleep is consistent and is regular sleep patterns, so I'm not lacking with REM or anything like that.

Anyone. And not to be told what to do or how to feel, just to get it off my chest.

Three weeks ago, I walked away from someone I still love with every cracked piece of my heart. It wasn’t because of betrayal or some big, dramatic fight. It was because we wanted different futures. The kind of difference that doesn’t resolve with time or compromise. One of those slow burning realizations that builds up like smoke behind the walls, until one day the house you built together isn’t safe anymore.

We spent five years weaving a life that smelled like Sunday coffee, sounded like shared playlists, and tasted like dark chocolate with chili flakes, her favorite. She was wild and soft all at once, the kind of person who could be both a thunderstorm and a lullaby. I still can’t walk past the wine aisle without thinking of the red blend she swore tasted like raspberries and regret.

She wanted kids. I didn’t. That was the root of it, simple and irreversible.

So I let her go. I didn’t fight or beg. I didn’t try to make promises I couldn’t keep. I loved her enough not to clip her wings just because I was scared of the silence she’d leave behind.

And now that silence is everywhere. It echoes in my apartment. It hums in the way I cook too much pasta. It’s there when I watch her favorite shows and pretend I don’t remember her laugh at the dumbest parts.

But here's the part I’m holding onto: I am still standing.

Not easily. Not cleanly. Some mornings, I sit on the shower floor and let the water hide my tears. But I'm standing.

I’ve started running again. I’ve picked up a leather-bound journal and started writing things I never said out loud. I’ve discovered that grief, like smoke, eventually thins. You can breathe again.

She deserves the life she dreams of. And I deserve one, I don’t have to lie to myself to live.

So yeah, my heart is still broken. But it’s beating in the direction of truth now. And for that, I’m grateful.
