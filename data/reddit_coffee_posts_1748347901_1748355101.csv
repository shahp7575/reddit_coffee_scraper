And every week I have to go through the rigmarole of seasoning it all over again like a Victorian apothecary.

I can't bring myself to say anything.  How do you explain ""Please don‚Äôt clean my coffee pot"" to someone you pay to clean things?

**D13 PreGames**

Domingo DeLuca (Game 75 D13 Games) had the help of Ransom Turnbull from Game 25, who had fled to District 13 after winning with his family, even if most of them had chosen to move back to District 12. 

Domingo approached the male bowl, reaching inside and selecting the name of eighteen year old Benjamin Best. Cameras focused on a taller boy with brown hair and brown eyes covered by wire frame glasses.

Benjamin shook Domingo‚Äôs hand before being taken into the justice hall for visits with family, where he said goodbye to his parents and twin brother Bellamy. Benjamin seemed sad to leave his family behind but soon headed to the train.

Domingo and Ransom helped teach Benjamin how to use a spear, which he did very well at. Benjamin was very open to the questions of the Capitolites at the train station, and even if parade was cancelled for this particular year he was still designed an interview outfit by Herminia Radcliffe.

During training Benjamin threw his spear at targets, appearing to worry the careers, Amora (1), Faustina (2), and Rod (4) who eyed him with surprise and distaste. 

Benjamin later scored an 8 for his display with a spear, and Domingo was very proud of him, allowing Benjamin to have some Capitol cake. Ransom seemed very proud of Benjamin as well, helping him rehearse for his interview.

During his interview, Benjamin remained confident in his ability to win, and also commented that he wanted to make sure that District 13 would become recognized as a threat and maybe even become a career. 

Benjamin was seen as a huge threat, and when Domingo and Ransom visited him in his launch room Domingo told Benjamin to try and attack a career while Ransom was more skeptical of this idea but remained silent on the matter. 


**D12 PreGames**

Peeta Mellark (Game 74) stood in front of the male bowl. The nervous boy sent a look back to his mentor, Woodbine Chance of Game 50, who rolled his eyes and nodded at Peeta. 

Peeta reached inside of the male bowl, selecting the name of seventeen year old Coal Alshire. Silence was heard before a throat was cleared and a boy of average height with olive skin, black hair, and gray eyes walked to the stage.

Coal eyed Peeta for a moment before shaking his hand. Coal visited with his parents and seven siblings in the justice hall, three brothers and four sisters. Coal awkwardly wished his family the best before being taken away.

On the train Coal showed Peeta and Woodbine his skills with a pickaxe, smiling as he seemed quite happy with his own skills, with coal mines opening up to anyone aged ten and up after Game 74 was over.

During training Coal enjoyed working further with a pickaxe, but also stopped to learn about various plants and fruits from Kaffir (11), while also brushing up on his medical skills, an industry that had been added to District 12 after Game 74.

Coal later scored a 6 for his various skills, seeming to make Peeta and Woodbine proud. Woodbine even bragged to Ransom about the skills of his tribute, seeming very proud.

Coal‚Äôs interview also went surprisingly well, as Coal was cordial to Caesar Flickerman, while at the same time holding confidence that District 12 would be able to win two Games in a row.

In his launch room, Coal was hugged by Peeta and wished the best of luck, while Woodbine told Coal to avoid the careers at all costs, as they were likely out for blood after the events of the previous Games.


**D11 PreGames**

Chaff Williams (Game 57) stood in front of District 11‚Äôs eligible names. He felt a ring of nerves surround him, but was glad that both of District 11‚Äôs tributes had been revived last year, thinking that Rue Hutchins and Thresh Blanchard had deserved it.

Chaff approached the male bowl, reaching inside and selecting the name of seventeen year old Kaffir Weidmeyer. Cameras focused on a boy with dark skin and braids all over his head. As Kaffir shook Chaff‚Äôs hand he sadly smiled to himself.

In the justice hall, Kaffir visited with his parents, younger brother, and younger sister. A tear dripped down Kaffir‚Äôs face as he said goodbye to his family members before being taken away.

On the train Chaff trained Kaffir with a pitchfork, while also quizzing him on his knowledge of various plants and fruits. Kaffir trained further with his pitchfork during training, later scoring a 7.

Kaffir‚Äôs interview involved him refusing to say much, which appeared to insult Caesar Flickerman. Kaffir responded that he was seventeen, and like other seventeen year olds he was a child, and a human being just like those in the Capitol.

After commenting that he refused to be a show pony for the Capitol, Kaffir left the stage of his own accord, receiving a beating later on. Chaff told Kaffir to win and prove the Capitol wrong, and Kaffir promised that he would try.


**D10 PreGames**

Equestria Paddock (Game 72) stood in front of District 10‚Äôs eligible females, wearing an engagement ring on her finger. As she approached the female bowl, she nervously twirled the ring on her finger.

Equestria selected the name of sixteen year old Catara Gelding from the bowl. A crying girl with bobbed dark brown hair and hazel eyes stepped up to the stage, shaking Equestria‚Äôs hand. 

In the justice hall Catara visited with her parents and older brother. Catara was full on sobbing as her family tried to calm her down, with her mother helping her take deep breaths, but Catara was soon taken away.

On the train Equestria successfully calmed Catara down, before reaching her varying skills with bladed weapons. Equestria also took the time to teach Catara knowledge of plants and fruits, which Catara worked with during training, scoring a 4 for her knowledge.

During her interview Catara burst into tears and had to be escorted off the stage, but Equestria still visited Catara in her launch room, reminding the girl that she was up against twelve youths and not twenty five, and that she could do it. 


**D9 PreGames**

Bale Bronski (Game 68) slowly approached the male bowl, nervous to possibly choose someone that he knew. Bale took a deep breath, glad that at least his siblings and cousins couldn‚Äôt be reaped.

Bale chose the name of eighteen year old Sickle Dankworth. Cameras focused on a tall young man with blonde curly hair and handsome blue eyes as he stepped forward and shook Bale‚Äôs hand. 

In the justice hall Sickle said goodbye to his parents, younger brother, and younger sister. He smiled at them as he promised to try and return, commenting that twelve would be easier to beat than twenty three. 

On the train Bale helped Sickle learn various skills with a scythe, smiling as Sickle did quite well. Sickle allied with Mitty, a tiny twelve year old from District 8, promising to protect her at all costs.

Sickle later scored an 8 for his scythe skills, and during his interview he commented that maybe having one tribute per District every Games would cause less rebellion, which no one booed him for.

Sickle was visited by Bale in his launch room, and Bale hugged Sickle close and wished him the best of luck, hugging him close before watching as Sickle rose up into the arena. 

**D8 PreGames**

Cecelia Taylor (60) stood in front of the bowls, glad that her children were too young to be eligible for this particular Games. Cecelia seemed nervous, hoping she would pick someone that was older.

Unfortunately Cecelia chose twelve year old Mitty Agnello. Cameras focused on a tiny girl with dark skin and braids as she burst into tears before slowly making her way to the stage. Cecelia hugged Mitty, apologizing to her.

In the justice hall Mitty said goodbye to her parents, three older brothers, three older sisters, and two younger brothers. Mitty sobbed as she said goodbye to her loved ones, sobbing as she was wished luck by her oldest brother Anthem.

On the train Cecelia worked with Mitty on how to use a knife, which Mitty worked further with under the close eye of her ally, Sickle (9), who promised to protect her at a costs and get her home.

Mitty scored a 4 for her skills, and during her interview she was seen as adorable and sweet and even complimented Caesar Flickerman on his outfit, which endeared her to the Capitol.

Cecelia had a hard time saying goodbye to Mitty, telling her to stay with Sickle as he was her best shot of survival. Cecelia cried as Mitty rose up into the arena, having grown attached to the young girl.


**D7 PreGames**

Papyrus Khorst (Game 54) stood in front of District 7‚Äôs eligible males, seeming upset that he had to do the reapings himself instead of an escort doing it. Papyrus approached the male bowl, pulling out a slip of paper and reading aloud the name.

When fifteen year old Nash Ogden was called, he let out a gasp of pure horror but slowly made his way to the stage. Nash had handsome brunette curls and blue eyes, and he glared at Papyrus as he shook his hand on the stage.

Nash said goodbye to his parents, older brother, and older sister. He had an expression of anger on his face and he clearly blamed Papyrus for choosing him. Nash hugged his parents before nodding to his older siblings before being taken away.

On the train Papyrus helped Nash work with an ad, even if Nash seemed to reject Papyrus a bit. Nash worked with an ax further during training, later scoring a 7 for it. 

Nash seemed to be rather strong willed, and during his interview he commented on how Katniss and Peeta had a double win the year before, and maybe District 7 would win both Quell 2 and Quell 3 of Game 75.

In his launch room Nash forgave Papyrus for reaping him, and Papyrus offered some final advice for Nash before he got into his tube and rose up into the arena.  


**D6 PreGames**

Illinois Hix (Game 61) stood in front of District 6‚Äôs eligible youths. He hoped that he wouldn‚Äôt pick anyone that he knew, but knew deep down that anything was possible.

Illinois chose the name of eighteen year old Huron Eastvale. A string of curses came from the back of the crowd as a tall young man with black hair and black eyes stepped up to the stage and angrily shook Illinois‚Äôs hand.

Huron visited with his younger brother as well as a few other youths from his gang, known as the bandits. Huron told his gang leader, a boy named Rhode to take care of his younger brother who was named Dover, before being taken away.

Shortly after arriving on the train Huron refused to hang his leather jacket up and got into an argument with a peacekeeper, before talking to Illinois about how to use a sledgehammer. Huron bragged that he already knew how, swinging one around with good expertise.

He continued to work with a sledgehammer during training, eventually pausing to work with a machete as well. Huron scored an 8 for his strong skills, later having good banter with Caesar Flickerman, mentioning his brother a few times.

In his launch room Huron had a final visit with Illinois, who promised to care for Huron‚Äôs brother if he died before Huron rose up into the arena, waving goodbye to Illinois.


**D5 PreGames**

Volta Wu (Game 57) stared straight ahead as she watched the youths begin to line up. She sipped from some tea before smiling up at Mayor Ross Reagan as she approached the male bowl. 

Volta chose the name of sixteen year old Galaxa Morrison, and watched as a bespectacled brunette girl with blue eyes stepped up to the stage, shaking Volta‚Äôs hand. It was then that Volta saw a huge scar on the side of the girl‚Äôs face that looked like an electrical burn scar.

Galaxa tearfully visited with her parents, two younger brothers, and younger sister. Galaxa had tears streaming down her face as her family wished her luck, before being taken away. 

On the train Volta calmed the crying girl down with some tea, before teaching her a few skills with an ice pick. She claimed that no one usually chose this weapon because knives usually existed, but that she had used one to win. 

Galaxa trained further with an ice pick during training, later scoring a 5, but Volta was still proud of her, having scored a 5 and won. Galaxa used her intelligence and shared a bunch of past arenas and how the runner up could‚Äôve won in them. 

At her launch room the next day, Galaxa panicked and had to be calmed down by Volta. A peacekeeper had to throw her into her tube before a screaming Galaxa rose up into the arena.


**D4 PreGames**

Finnick Odair (Game 65) stood next to Mayor Delora Riviera as he took deep breaths, sipping from a cup of coffee. He was glad that the trafficking of victors was over, but worried that someone he knew could be reaped to punish him for his revelation of the trafficking even existing.

Finnick also worried that now that District 4‚Äôs career title had been taken away for not being serious enough about it that anyone could be reaped, even his own children.

Finnick reached into the male bowl, selecting the name of eighteen year old Rod Tartal. Cameras focused on a frightened looking young man with long red hair and green eyes as he made his way to the stage and shook Rod‚Äôs hand.

In the town hall Rod visited with his father and two younger brothers. Rod‚Äôs mother and unborn sister had died in a boating accident a few years ago, leaving Rod‚Äôs house with only male inhabitants. Rod hugged his family but was soon taken away.

Finnick helped teach Rod various skills with a trident, as well as with a spear. Finnick also taught Rod how to trap other tributes in a net to kill them, seeming proud of Rod for his hard work and effort.

During training Rod kept to himself, working with a trident to the best of his ability. Once finished Rod scored a 9 for his talent with a trident. His interview went well with Rod seeming very flirtatious and having a good sense of humor.

At his launch room Rod told Finnick that he planned to work alone, as he didn‚Äôt trust the careers or the outliers. Finnick kindly wished Rod luck as he rose up into the arena.


**D3 PreGames**

Nokia Neverson (Game 55) stood in front of District 3‚Äôs eligible females, seeming nervous that one of her friend‚Äôs children would be reaped, especially after the show of rebellion that got Nokia‚Äôs parents killed, even if her younger brother was spared and never reaped and was now safe.

Nokia reached into the bowl, selecting the name of seventeen year old Nettica Stanford. Cameras focused on a girl with bobbed blonde curls as she stepped up to the stage, shaking Nokia‚Äôs hand. Nokia noticed that Nettica was using crutches and sighed.

Nettica visited with her parents and older brother, crying as she said her goodbyes, knowing how low her chances were of winning, especially since she had broken her leg a few weeks ago and needed the crutches to walk. 

Nokia helped Nettica learn to walk without the crutches, and also taught her how to use a taser, a new weapon that had recently been introduced to the Games. Nokia also worked with Nettica on how to impress the Capitol during her interview.

Nettica worked with a taser during training, managing to perform quite well. She later scored a 6 for her skills, and during her interview she commented that even with her mobility issues she could still win.

Nokia visited a panicked Nettica in her launch room, making the girl promise to stay calm and try to win for her. Nokia commented that District 3 was due another victor soon, and that she believed in Nettica.


**D2 PreGames**

Enobaria Young (Game 62) stood in front of the eligible female youths. The reaping games had four categories, weaponry, athleticism, non weaponry skills, and combat fighting skills.

The first female up was Augustina Kearney (18), who showed off strong sword skills, was very quick, and was quite good at animal identification skills. She made it to the final round, placing 2nd, 2nd, and 3rd each round.

The other contender was Faustina Brackett, who showed of great spear throwing skills, was quite good at dodging, and was great at identifying poisonous plants and fruits. She also made it to the final round, placing 4th, 1st, and 2nd each round.

The fight was a sword fight, with many expecting Augustina to come out on top, but it was Faustina that defeated Augustina 14 to 7 and earned the role of female tribute, shaking Enobaria‚Äôs hand on the stage. Faustina had long red hair and green eyes.

In the justice hall Faustina visited with her parents and older brother. She excitedly promised to return and make them proud, before being taken to the train, where she got along well with Enobaria, later even working further with a spear.

Faustina allied with Amora (1) and the two worked with various weaponry during training, with Faustina later scoring a 10 for her spear skills. Faustina‚Äôs interview included her bragging about her skills and planning to bring a win for District 2.

In her launch room Faustina was visited by Enobaria, who offered a candy to Faustina which she quickly ate. Faustina then listened to Enobaria‚Äôs advice before rising up into the arena. 


**D1 PreGames**

Cashmere Vanderbilt (Game 64) stood in front of District 1‚Äôs eligible females. The reaping games had four categories, weaponry skills, athleticism skills, non weaponry skills, and interview skills.

Amora Mayweather (17) aced the weaponry skills with an archery display, while also showing great speed and great camouflage skills. She successfully made it to the interview round. She placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

Glitteria Rothschild (17) did quite well in the weaponry category by using throwing knives, while dodging hits quite well and showing off great medical skills, making it into the interview round. She placed 3rd, 1st, and 2nd.

Amora had quite strong interview skills and almost seemed to flirt with Cashmere, while Glitteria‚Äôs responses were quick and concise. Ultimately Amora won the role of tribute by Cashmere‚Äôs vote, and the girl with the platinum curls and blue eyes seemed very happy.

Amora visited with her parents, younger brother, and younger sister. She seemed quite excited to try and pull off a win for District 1, which hadn‚Äôt won since the 67th Games and was ‚Äúdue a win over any other District.‚Äù

Cashmere helped Amora with her archery skills, which was how she had won her Games. Cashmere also helped Amora build an alliance with Faustina (2). The two girls planned for various arenas, with Amora later scoring a 9 for her archery skills.

Amora‚Äôs interview went quite well, and she bragged about her weaponry skills and had a very charismatic attitude. Cashmere visited Amora in her launch room, wishing her the best of luck and promising to sponsor her.",1,1748354595.0,MaisGames,0,1.0,False

Domingo DeLuca (Game 75 D13 Games) had the help of Ransom Turnbull from Game 25, who had fled to District 13 after winning with his family, even if most of them had chosen to move back to District 12. 

Domingo approached the male bowl, reaching inside and selecting the name of eighteen year old Benjamin Best. Cameras focused on a taller boy with brown hair and brown eyes covered by wire frame glasses.

Benjamin shook Domingo‚Äôs hand before being taken into the justice hall for visits with family, where he said goodbye to his parents and twin brother Bellamy. Benjamin seemed sad to leave his family behind but soon headed to the train.

Domingo and Ransom helped teach Benjamin how to use a spear, which he did very well at. Benjamin was very open to the questions of the Capitolites at the train station, and even if parade was cancelled for this particular year he was still designed an interview outfit by Herminia Radcliffe.

Benjamin was seen as a huge threat, and when Domingo and Ransom visited him in his launch room Domingo told Benjamin to try and attack a career while Ransom was more skeptical of this idea but remained silent on the matter. 


**D12 PreGames**

Peeta Mellark (Game 74) stood in front of the male bowl. The nervous boy sent a look back to his mentor, Woodbine Chance of Game 50, who rolled his eyes and nodded at Peeta. 

Peeta reached inside of the male bowl, selecting the name of seventeen year old Coal Alshire. Silence was heard before a throat was cleared and a boy of average height with olive skin, black hair, and gray eyes walked to the stage.

Coal eyed Peeta for a moment before shaking his hand. Coal visited with his parents and seven siblings in the justice hall, three brothers and four sisters. Coal awkwardly wished his family the best before being taken away.

On the train Coal showed Peeta and Woodbine his skills with a pickaxe, smiling as he seemed quite happy with his own skills, with coal mines opening up to anyone aged ten and up after Game 74 was over.

During training Coal enjoyed working further with a pickaxe, but also stopped to learn about various plants and fruits from Kaffir (11), while also brushing up on his medical skills, an industry that had been added to District 12 after Game 74.

Coal later scored a 6 for his various skills, seeming to make Peeta and Woodbine proud. Woodbine even bragged to Ransom about the skills of his tribute, seeming very proud.

Coal‚Äôs interview also went surprisingly well, as Coal was cordial to Caesar Flickerman, while at the same time holding confidence that District 12 would be able to win two Games in a row.

In his launch room, Coal was hugged by Peeta and wished the best of luck, while Woodbine told Coal to avoid the careers at all costs, as they were likely out for blood after the events of the previous Games.


**D11 PreGames**

Chaff Williams (Game 57) stood in front of District 11‚Äôs eligible names. He felt a ring of nerves surround him, but was glad that both of District 11‚Äôs tributes had been revived last year, thinking that Rue Hutchins and Thresh Blanchard had deserved it.

Chaff approached the male bowl, reaching inside and selecting the name of seventeen year old Kaffir Weidmeyer. Cameras focused on a boy with dark skin and braids all over his head. As Kaffir shook Chaff‚Äôs hand he sadly smiled to himself.

In the justice hall, Kaffir visited with his parents, younger brother, and younger sister. A tear dripped down Kaffir‚Äôs face as he said goodbye to his family members before being taken away.

On the train Chaff trained Kaffir with a pitchfork, while also quizzing him on his knowledge of various plants and fruits. Kaffir trained further with his pitchfork during training, later scoring a 7.

Kaffir‚Äôs interview involved him refusing to say much, which appeared to insult Caesar Flickerman. Kaffir responded that he was seventeen, and like other seventeen year olds he was a child, and a human being just like those in the Capitol.

After commenting that he refused to be a show pony for the Capitol, Kaffir left the stage of his own accord, receiving a beating later on. Chaff told Kaffir to win and prove the Capitol wrong, and Kaffir promised that he would try.


**D10 PreGames**

Equestria Paddock (Game 72) stood in front of District 10‚Äôs eligible females, wearing an engagement ring on her finger. As she approached the female bowl, she nervously twirled the ring on her finger.

Equestria selected the name of sixteen year old Catara Gelding from the bowl. A crying girl with bobbed dark brown hair and hazel eyes stepped up to the stage, shaking Equestria‚Äôs hand. 

In the justice hall Catara visited with her parents and older brother. Catara was full on sobbing as her family tried to calm her down, with her mother helping her take deep breaths, but Catara was soon taken away.

**D9 PreGames**

Bale Bronski (Game 68) slowly approached the male bowl, nervous to possibly choose someone that he knew. Bale took a deep breath, glad that at least his siblings and cousins couldn‚Äôt be reaped.

Bale chose the name of eighteen year old Sickle Dankworth. Cameras focused on a tall young man with blonde curly hair and handsome blue eyes as he stepped forward and shook Bale‚Äôs hand. 

In the justice hall Sickle said goodbye to his parents, younger brother, and younger sister. He smiled at them as he promised to try and return, commenting that twelve would be easier to beat than twenty three. 

On the train Bale helped Sickle learn various skills with a scythe, smiling as Sickle did quite well. Sickle allied with Mitty, a tiny twelve year old from District 8, promising to protect her at all costs.

Sickle later scored an 8 for his scythe skills, and during his interview he commented that maybe having one tribute per District every Games would cause less rebellion, which no one booed him for.

Sickle was visited by Bale in his launch room, and Bale hugged Sickle close and wished him the best of luck, hugging him close before watching as Sickle rose up into the arena. 

**D8 PreGames**

Cecelia Taylor (60) stood in front of the bowls, glad that her children were too young to be eligible for this particular Games. Cecelia seemed nervous, hoping she would pick someone that was older.

Unfortunately Cecelia chose twelve year old Mitty Agnello. Cameras focused on a tiny girl with dark skin and braids as she burst into tears before slowly making her way to the stage. Cecelia hugged Mitty, apologizing to her.

In the justice hall Mitty said goodbye to her parents, three older brothers, three older sisters, and two younger brothers. Mitty sobbed as she said goodbye to her loved ones, sobbing as she was wished luck by her oldest brother Anthem.

On the train Cecelia worked with Mitty on how to use a knife, which Mitty worked further with under the close eye of her ally, Sickle (9), who promised to protect her at a costs and get her home.

Mitty scored a 4 for her skills, and during her interview she was seen as adorable and sweet and even complimented Caesar Flickerman on his outfit, which endeared her to the Capitol.

Cecelia had a hard time saying goodbye to Mitty, telling her to stay with Sickle as he was her best shot of survival. Cecelia cried as Mitty rose up into the arena, having grown attached to the young girl.


**D7 PreGames**

Papyrus Khorst (Game 54) stood in front of District 7‚Äôs eligible males, seeming upset that he had to do the reapings himself instead of an escort doing it. Papyrus approached the male bowl, pulling out a slip of paper and reading aloud the name.

When fifteen year old Nash Ogden was called, he let out a gasp of pure horror but slowly made his way to the stage. Nash had handsome brunette curls and blue eyes, and he glared at Papyrus as he shook his hand on the stage.

Nash said goodbye to his parents, older brother, and older sister. He had an expression of anger on his face and he clearly blamed Papyrus for choosing him. Nash hugged his parents before nodding to his older siblings before being taken away.

On the train Papyrus helped Nash work with an ad, even if Nash seemed to reject Papyrus a bit. Nash worked with an ax further during training, later scoring a 7 for it. 

Nash seemed to be rather strong willed, and during his interview he commented on how Katniss and Peeta had a double win the year before, and maybe District 7 would win both Quell 2 and Quell 3 of Game 75.

In his launch room Nash forgave Papyrus for reaping him, and Papyrus offered some final advice for Nash before he got into his tube and rose up into the arena.  


**D6 PreGames**

Illinois Hix (Game 61) stood in front of District 6‚Äôs eligible youths. He hoped that he wouldn‚Äôt pick anyone that he knew, but knew deep down that anything was possible.

Illinois chose the name of eighteen year old Huron Eastvale. A string of curses came from the back of the crowd as a tall young man with black hair and black eyes stepped up to the stage and angrily shook Illinois‚Äôs hand.

Huron visited with his younger brother as well as a few other youths from his gang, known as the bandits. Huron told his gang leader, a boy named Rhode to take care of his younger brother who was named Dover, before being taken away.

Shortly after arriving on the train Huron refused to hang his leather jacket up and got into an argument with a peacekeeper, before talking to Illinois about how to use a sledgehammer. Huron bragged that he already knew how, swinging one around with good expertise.

He continued to work with a sledgehammer during training, eventually pausing to work with a machete as well. Huron scored an 8 for his strong skills, later having good banter with Caesar Flickerman, mentioning his brother a few times.

In his launch room Huron had a final visit with Illinois, who promised to care for Huron‚Äôs brother if he died before Huron rose up into the arena, waving goodbye to Illinois.


**D5 PreGames**

Volta Wu (Game 57) stared straight ahead as she watched the youths begin to line up. She sipped from some tea before smiling up at Mayor Ross Reagan as she approached the male bowl. 

Volta chose the name of sixteen year old Galaxa Morrison, and watched as a bespectacled brunette girl with blue eyes stepped up to the stage, shaking Volta‚Äôs hand. It was then that Volta saw a huge scar on the side of the girl‚Äôs face that looked like an electrical burn scar.

Galaxa tearfully visited with her parents, two younger brothers, and younger sister. Galaxa had tears streaming down her face as her family wished her luck, before being taken away. 

On the train Volta calmed the crying girl down with some tea, before teaching her a few skills with an ice pick. She claimed that no one usually chose this weapon because knives usually existed, but that she had used one to win. 

Galaxa trained further with an ice pick during training, later scoring a 5, but Volta was still proud of her, having scored a 5 and won. Galaxa used her intelligence and shared a bunch of past arenas and how the runner up could‚Äôve won in them. 

At her launch room the next day, Galaxa panicked and had to be calmed down by Volta. A peacekeeper had to throw her into her tube before a screaming Galaxa rose up into the arena.


**D4 PreGames**

Finnick Odair (Game 65) stood next to Mayor Delora Riviera as he took deep breaths, sipping from a cup of coffee. He was glad that the trafficking of victors was over, but worried that someone he knew could be reaped to punish him for his revelation of the trafficking even existing.

Finnick also worried that now that District 4‚Äôs career title had been taken away for not being serious enough about it that anyone could be reaped, even his own children.

Finnick reached into the male bowl, selecting the name of eighteen year old Rod Tartal. Cameras focused on a frightened looking young man with long red hair and green eyes as he made his way to the stage and shook Rod‚Äôs hand.

In the town hall Rod visited with his father and two younger brothers. Rod‚Äôs mother and unborn sister had died in a boating accident a few years ago, leaving Rod‚Äôs house with only male inhabitants. Rod hugged his family but was soon taken away.

Finnick helped teach Rod various skills with a trident, as well as with a spear. Finnick also taught Rod how to trap other tributes in a net to kill them, seeming proud of Rod for his hard work and effort.

During training Rod kept to himself, working with a trident to the best of his ability. Once finished Rod scored a 9 for his talent with a trident. His interview went well with Rod seeming very flirtatious and having a good sense of humor.

At his launch room Rod told Finnick that he planned to work alone, as he didn‚Äôt trust the careers or the outliers. Finnick kindly wished Rod luck as he rose up into the arena.


**D3 PreGames**

Nokia Neverson (Game 55) stood in front of District 3‚Äôs eligible females, seeming nervous that one of her friend‚Äôs children would be reaped, especially after the show of rebellion that got Nokia‚Äôs parents killed, even if her younger brother was spared and never reaped and was now safe.

Nokia reached into the bowl, selecting the name of seventeen year old Nettica Stanford. Cameras focused on a girl with bobbed blonde curls as she stepped up to the stage, shaking Nokia‚Äôs hand. Nokia noticed that Nettica was using crutches and sighed.

Nettica visited with her parents and older brother, crying as she said her goodbyes, knowing how low her chances were of winning, especially since she had broken her leg a few weeks ago and needed the crutches to walk. 

Nokia helped Nettica learn to walk without the crutches, and also taught her how to use a taser, a new weapon that had recently been introduced to the Games. Nokia also worked with Nettica on how to impress the Capitol during her interview.

Nettica worked with a taser during training, managing to perform quite well. She later scored a 6 for her skills, and during her interview she commented that even with her mobility issues she could still win.

Nokia visited a panicked Nettica in her launch room, making the girl promise to stay calm and try to win for her. Nokia commented that District 3 was due another victor soon, and that she believed in Nettica.


**D2 PreGames**

Enobaria Young (Game 62) stood in front of the eligible female youths. The reaping games had four categories, weaponry, athleticism, non weaponry skills, and combat fighting skills.

The first female up was Augustina Kearney (18), who showed off strong sword skills, was very quick, and was quite good at animal identification skills. She made it to the final round, placing 2nd, 2nd, and 3rd each round.

The other contender was Faustina Brackett, who showed of great spear throwing skills, was quite good at dodging, and was great at identifying poisonous plants and fruits. She also made it to the final round, placing 4th, 1st, and 2nd each round.

The fight was a sword fight, with many expecting Augustina to come out on top, but it was Faustina that defeated Augustina 14 to 7 and earned the role of female tribute, shaking Enobaria‚Äôs hand on the stage. Faustina had long red hair and green eyes.

In the justice hall Faustina visited with her parents and older brother. She excitedly promised to return and make them proud, before being taken to the train, where she got along well with Enobaria, later even working further with a spear.

Faustina allied with Amora (1) and the two worked with various weaponry during training, with Faustina later scoring a 10 for her spear skills. Faustina‚Äôs interview included her bragging about her skills and planning to bring a win for District 2.

In her launch room Faustina was visited by Enobaria, who offered a candy to Faustina which she quickly ate. Faustina then listened to Enobaria‚Äôs advice before rising up into the arena. 


**D1 PreGames**

Cashmere Vanderbilt (Game 64) stood in front of District 1‚Äôs eligible females. The reaping games had four categories, weaponry skills, athleticism skills, non weaponry skills, and interview skills.

Amora Mayweather (17) aced the weaponry skills with an archery display, while also showing great speed and great camouflage skills. She successfully made it to the interview round. She placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

Glitteria Rothschild (17) did quite well in the weaponry category by using throwing knives, while dodging hits quite well and showing off great medical skills, making it into the interview round. She placed 3rd, 1st, and 2nd.

Amora had quite strong interview skills and almost seemed to flirt with Cashmere, while Glitteria‚Äôs responses were quick and concise. Ultimately Amora won the role of tribute by Cashmere‚Äôs vote, and the girl with the platinum curls and blue eyes seemed very happy.

Amora visited with her parents, younger brother, and younger sister. She seemed quite excited to try and pull off a win for District 1, which hadn‚Äôt won since the 67th Games and was ‚Äúdue a win over any other District.‚Äù

Cashmere helped Amora with her archery skills, which was how she had won her Games. Cashmere also helped Amora build an alliance with Faustina (2). The two girls planned for various arenas, with Amora later scoring a 9 for her archery skills.

Amora‚Äôs interview went quite well, and she bragged about her weaponry skills and had a very charismatic attitude. Cashmere visited Amora in her launch room, wishing her the best of luck and promising to sponsor her.",1,1748354569.0,christianblanco,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Four Guardians 

Fr. Logan, the Monsignor at Mary Help of Christians Church on 12th Street in the East Village, was no ordinary priest. He was a mystic ‚Äî gifted with the rare ability to communicate with angels and spirits. They knew it too, which is why several Guardian Angels approached him with a troubling dilemma.

Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Ava ‚Äî all Guardians ‚Äî reported a strange encounter. A portion of their energy had been drained after their human charges came into brief contact with a mysterious man outside morning Mass. The man had greeted each person cheerfully, gave them a light pat on the back or shoulder, and introduced himself as Giacomo.

The moment the contact was made, the angels felt it ‚Äî a pull, like something siphoning power straight from them. They watched in alarm as Giacomo‚Äôs backpack glowed faintly with each interaction, as though it were absorbing the energy and storing it. For what purpose, they didn‚Äôt know. He didn‚Äôt appear to be an angel or a spirit. From what they could tell, he was human ‚Äî but one with unnatural abilities.

The Monsignor was troubled. He consulted with members of his congregation, asking if anyone had heard of such a person or had any knowledge of this type of phenomenon. Several parishioners brought up the same name: Julius Q. Bygone.

A neighborhood fixture, Julius was known to possess gifts of his own ‚Äî mental telepathy, communion with spirits, the ability to wrestle ghosts and walk through dreams. A supernatural sleuth, if there ever was one.

It sounded like exactly the kind of man Monsignor Logan needed.

Julius lived nearby, in a modest studio on East 14th Street. He had a reputation for being eccentric ‚Äî but in a good way. He had an odd obsession with the color brown: brown suit, brown socks, brown shoes. Always topped off with a fedora, complete with a red feather in the band. He also happened to be a die-hard Grateful Dead fan ‚Äî though he preferred his tie-dye only if it came in shades of brown (a fact that amused no one more than himself).

The Monsignor found an old copy of The Village Voice, flipping to an ad that read:

JULIUS Q. BYGONE
Supernatural Sleuth of Shadows
Experienced in paranormal phenomena & mystery solving
‚Äî Phone number listed below ‚Äî

Logan called the number. When Julius answered, the Monsignor felt a faint vibration through the phone ‚Äî subtle, but unmistakable.

He explained the situation briefly. Julius listened, intrigued.

They set the meeting for that afternoon. 2 p.m. At the church.

Chapter 2: The Holy Encounter 

Julius Q. Bygone strode into Monsignor Logan‚Äôs office like an actor making his entrance onstage. That was just his style.

Monsignor filled him in on the dilemma facing the four guardian angels. Julius listened closely, then asked, ‚ÄúDid they experience any adverse effects from the power drain?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Monsignor replied. ‚ÄúWithin a day or two, they recovered completely. They never felt it was enough to put their humans in any real danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a good sign. Hopefully this Giacomo doesn‚Äôt have bad intentions. But we can‚Äôt take anything for granted at this point,‚Äù Julius said.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only approached parishioners leaving morning Mass,‚Äù Monsignor added. ‚ÄúWith your extrasensory perception, you should be able to stake it out tomorrow and, hopefully, pick up his vibe.‚Äù

Julius banged his open hand on the desk.
‚ÄúOutstanding plan!‚Äù he shouted, clearly excited by the prospect of meeting the mysterious Giacomo. As he turned to leave, he added with a half-smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an overly pious man, Monsignor, but I‚Äôm looking forward to Mass tomorrow.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The next morning, Julius took a seat in the last pew near the center aisle, where the parishioners typically exited.

He wasn‚Äôt a regular churchgoer, but he followed along‚Äîstanding, kneeling, and sitting when the others did.

Monsignor delivered an especially moving homily about loving your neighbor‚Äîespecially your enemies. A subtle message, Julius suspected, meant for Giacomo, in case he was in the congregation.

When Mass ended, the crowd filed out slowly. A few lingered behind to light candles or pray silently.

Then Julius felt it‚Äîa faint buzzing in his chest. His senses perked. The buzz grew stronger as he wandered the church, scanning quietly, drawn forward like a divining rod to water. 

And there he was.

A man stood at the front of the church, his hand gently resting on the shoulder of an elderly woman who was kneeling in front of a statue of the Blessed Mother.

Julius noticed it immediately‚Äîa subtle glow pulsing from the man‚Äôs backpack. A sure sign: a small portion of the woman‚Äôs guardian angel‚Äôs power was being siphoned away.

Julius believed in being direct. He was also an experienced ghost wrestler. If Giacomo bolted, Julius had no doubt he could subdue him.

But before he could act, Giacomo turned and spotted him. His expression wasn‚Äôt guilty or frightened‚Äîjust a bit bewildered. Then, to Julius‚Äôs surprise, he began walking toward him.

‚ÄúMr. Bygone,‚Äù Giacomo said warmly, extending a hand. ‚ÄúWhat a coincidence. I was planning to call you when I got home‚ÄîI saw your ad on Craigslist. You sound like just the man I need.‚Äù

Julius shook his hand emphatically, though with a hint of caution. Julius was a man of extremes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a long story to tell,‚Äù Giacomo continued. ‚ÄúA long, interesting story‚Äîand I‚Äôm quite sure that once you hear it, you‚Äôll be able to help me.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy apartment‚Äôs about ten blocks from here,‚Äù Julius said, straightening his brown tie. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I conduct all my business. Why don‚Äôt we walk over there, and you can tell me your story over a fresh pot of coffee?‚Äù

Chapter 3: The Legend of Octavio

Giacomo sat at Julius‚Äôs table. Julius placed two coffee mugs down, then reached for the ever-present pot perched on the eternal flame. In Julius Q. Bygone‚Äôs apartment, the coffee was always hot, always ready‚Äîblack as ink and strong enough to raise the dead.

The apartment was a minimalist‚Äôs fever dream. A square, bare studio on East 14th Street: a table, a fridge, a couch that doubled as a bed, a dresser, and a large mirror nailed to the wall. Every item was brown. Brown table, brown couch, brown walls, brown fridge. Even the coffee mugs were brown. Julius loved brown like most men loved air or music.

‚ÄúMilk? Sugar?‚Äù Julius offered.

‚ÄúNo thanks,‚Äù Giacomo said, gripping the mug. ‚ÄúI take it black.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame here.‚Äù Julius nodded with approval. ‚ÄúAll right. Let‚Äôs start brainstorming your problem.‚Äù

Giacomo took a breath, then began.

‚ÄúIt starts in Catania, Sicily. My grandfather Octavio lived at the base of a volcano. A real one. Mount Etna. He built a glass house down there‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask how it didn‚Äôt melt or explode. That‚Äôs part of the legend. He was born with a tail nub at the base of his spine. Not long, just a bump. But it gave him strength‚Äîreal strength, supernatural strength.‚Äù

Julius leaned in, mug steaming between his hands.

‚ÄúLiving nearby, in the surrounding forest, was a tribe of werewolves. Not the fairy tale kind. These were wild things. They‚Äôd raid the villages‚Äîsteal livestock, break into homes, carry off food and valuables. They left fear in their wake.

‚ÄúBut one day they made a fatal mistake. They tried to raid Octavio‚Äôs house.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt know what they were dealing with. Octavio wasn‚Äôt just strong‚Äîhe was a fighter. Hand-to-hand, blades, anything. Rumor was he‚Äôd been a mercenary in his youth, but he never talked about it.

‚ÄúHis weapon was an axe‚Äîan old thing, the blade forged from silver. That blade could tear through werewolf hide like a carving knife through lamb. But the real trick? When he held it at a certain angle, it vibrated. Let out this hum‚Äîlike a singing bowl crossed with thunder. The sound created a force field. Invisible, but solid. No werewolf could cross it.‚Äù

Julius‚Äôs eyes narrowed in fascination. ‚ÄúHe killed them?‚Äù

‚ÄúA few, yeah. The rest fled back into the forest. Octavio stood his ground and told them, ‚ÄòCome back, and I‚Äôll finish the job.‚Äô So they stayed away‚Äîate raccoon and possum to survive. They hated him. But they feared him more.‚Äù

Giacomo‚Äôs voice dropped to a whisper.

‚ÄúThey cursed him. Or rather, they cursed his youngest grandson‚Äîme. Every weekend, when I sleep, they come for me in my dreams. They hunt me, tear at me, beat me bloody. I wake up on Monday drained and trembling. Too weak to live. I just hide until Friday‚Ä¶ and then it starts again.‚Äù

He paused, wiping sweat from his brow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried everything, Julius. Therapists. Meds. Spiritualists. Nothing works. But I have a theory. If I can reach my grandfather in the afterlife‚Äîif I can find him‚ÄîI believe he can give me the axe. And with it, I can fight the werewolves in my dreams. End the curse.‚Äù

Julius raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre stealing angel power‚Ä¶ to build a portal?‚Äù

Giacomo nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a little. Not enough to hurt them. But I need energy‚Äîholy energy‚Äîto open the gate. The backpack charges up when I touch their humans. Just a small draw. Nothing more.‚Äù

Julius studied him. He didn‚Äôt sense malice in the boy. There was desperation, yes. But no darkness.

‚ÄúI asked around,‚Äù Giacomo added. ‚ÄúThey said you‚Äôre a dream-walker. A man who can enter the sleep world. I figured if anyone could help, it was you.‚Äù

Julius tapped his fingers on the brown table. The story was wild. Preposterous. Which meant it was probably true.

‚ÄúYou may not need a portal,‚Äù Julius said finally. ‚ÄúIf you come back here at midnight‚Äîbring something that belonged to Octavio‚ÄîI can summon his spirit. Right here. We can speak to him directly.‚Äù

Giacomo‚Äôs eyes lit up. He reached into his shirt and pulled out a necklace. Hanging from the chain was a single yellowed fang.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbelonged to my grandfather. A werewolf fang. He pulled it himself from one of the beasts he killed.‚Äù

Julius smiled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back at midnight,‚Äù Giacomo said, rising. ‚ÄúThank you, Julius. Really.‚Äù

Julius watched him leave. There was hope now. Because this battle wasn‚Äôt about strength. Not really. It was a war of the mind‚Äîand that just so happened to be Julius Q. Bygone‚Äôs favorite kind.

Chapter 4: The Werewolf Fang

It was midnight on Wednesday in Julius‚Äôs studio apartment on 14th Street. Giacomo was already seated at the table, anxiously awaiting the spirit of his grandfather. If all went well, the curse would be broken, and he might finally get some rest this weekend. But it wouldn‚Äôt be easy.

Julius took the werewolf fang necklace that had once belonged to Octavio and placed it in a ceramic bowl in the center of the table. At the stroke of midnight, he began clapping his hands together rhythmically and chanting in a low, resonant tone. Often, these initial encounters required force‚ÄîJulius had been known to wrestle a ghost or two into submission‚Äîbut something told him this one would come more willingly.

From the ceiling, a mist would descended‚Äîswirling gray and white like fog lit by moonlight. It spiraled slowly downward, then settled on the floor, taking human shape. A strong, stocky figure emerged: white hair to the shoulders, a thick beard, and the presence of a man who had lived through battle and legend.

Giacomo was overcome with emotion.

‚ÄúGrandpa Octavio,‚Äù he said, rising from his seat.

He didn‚Äôt need to ask. He knew. Octavio extended a weathered hand, and they touched‚Äîtwo generations reunited in spirit and blood. Julius stood off to the side, giving the moment its space but keeping the business at hand in focus.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs much to discuss,‚Äù Julius said gently, steering the meeting forward.

Giacomo turned to his grandfather.

‚ÄúGrandfather, I‚Äôve fallen victim to the werewolves‚Äô curse. As revenge for you driving them into the forest, they targeted your youngest grandson‚Äîme. Every weekend, they attack me in my dreams. They beat me mercilessly until I wake up Monday morning too scared and weak to function. Then it starts again. Every Friday night.‚Äù

Octavio listened closely, his expression a mix of compassion and disappointment. His eyes narrowed with the weight of ancestral expectation.

‚ÄúI had hoped,‚Äù Octavio said, ‚Äúthat my grandson would show more fight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to fight for me,‚Äù Giacomo replied firmly. ‚ÄúI know this is my curse, and my burden. I just ask for the weapon you once wielded‚Äîthe silver-bladed axe. It‚Äôs my inheritance, isn‚Äôt it? You used it to defeat the werewolf clan and protect the villagers. I want to use it now to protect myself and finally break the curse.‚Äù

Octavio nodded solemnly.

‚ÄúThe axe remains where I left it‚Äîby the front door of my glass house at the foot of the volcano. I killed my final foe with it‚ÄîFang, their leader. A vicious, capable fighter. His death brought peace to the village and to my soul. But that peace has been disturbed. And now it must be restored.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen Friday night, when I dream,‚Äù Giacomo said, his confidence growing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll return to your house, claim the silver axe, and fight the werewolf tribe the way you did.‚Äù

Octavio shook his head slightly.

‚ÄúThis is not about the tribe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about me and Fang. My blood and his. Your battle won‚Äôt be against them‚Äîit will be against Claw, Fang‚Äôs grandson and their new leader. Your fight is a duel between heirs. If you survive, the curse ends.‚Äù

He turned to Julius.

‚ÄúThe fang in that necklace‚Äîit belonged to Fang. Use it. Summon him now, so he can accept the final showdown. His blood against mine.‚Äù

Julius, wide-eyed with excitement, gave a theatrical flourish and began clapping again, deeper and slower this time. The energy in the room shifted‚Äîheavier now, more primal.

From the floor, a thick black smoke began to rise, and with it came a faint, musky scent of earth, sweat, and something darker. Fang emerged‚Äîa towering presence with sharp, angular features and the deep, guttural silence of a warrior returned from the grave. It was the first time he had faced Octavio since the moment that silver blade struck him down.

Talk about uncomfortable, Julius thought.

The two stood across from each other like statues, no words exchanged‚Äîjust the history of blood, battle, and grudging respect passing between them.

Octavio offered the challenge. Fang, still honorable in death, accepted it with a nod. They couldn‚Äôt shake hands, but the meaning was clear.

So it was set.

Friday night, when Giacomo drifted into sleep, he would enter the glass house at the volcano‚Äôs base, retrieve the silver axe, and battle Claw to end the blood feud once and for all.

Chapter 5: The Reconciliation 

The next morning, Julius arranged a meeting at the church for 10 a.m. between Monsignor Logan‚Äîthe mystic priest‚Äîand the four guardian angels: Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva, whose Heavenly energy had been siphoned by Giacomo.

Julius strode into the church alongside Giacomo. Morning mass was long over, and the pews were mostly empty, the last of the parishioners having returned to work, still warmed by the Monsignor‚Äôs elegant homily. Up front, Monsignor Logan sat alone in silent reflection. He smiled as he caught sight of them walking down the aisle.

They exchanged handshakes, and Giacomo came straight to the point. He asked the Monsignor to summon the four angels. He had something to return to them‚Äîand as harmless as it may have turned out to be, he admitted he shouldn‚Äôt have taken their energy without permission.

Monsignor Logan chuckled softly and suggested, ‚ÄúConfession‚ÄîSaturday afternoon?‚Äù Then he stood with his palms raised skyward in quiet prayer.

A soft shimmer filled the air as the four guardian angels appeared, with Mateo stepping forward as their spokesman.

Giacomo bowed his head, sincerely apologetic. He removed the backpack containing their stolen energy and handed it to Mateo.

‚ÄúI know the portal is no longer necessary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I would‚Äôve returned this regardless. I made a mistake. I see that now. I‚Äôm sorry‚Äîand I ask for your forgiveness.‚Äù

The angels were visibly moved. Mateo accepted the pack, and they exchanged glances, their expressions softening.

Monsignor Logan smiled warmly. ‚ÄúNo need to wait for Saturday. Your confession is heard. Your sins are forgiven.‚Äù

Julius stepped forward and shared the events of the night before‚Äîwhat had happened in his apartment, the revelations, the danger ahead. The angels listened intently, concern etched into their radiant faces.

They warned Giacomo against confronting Claw‚Äîbut understood that sometimes battle could not be avoided. Even the Heavenly Host knew that, as with Saint Michael and Lucifer. They placed their blessings upon him and promised to support him spiritually in the fight to come.

Overwhelmed by their kindness, Giacomo‚Äôs eyes welled up with tears. He quickly composed himself.

‚ÄúA true spiritual warrior,‚Äù said Monsignor Logan, placing a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúI sensed it when I first met you. I will pray for you. For your victory, for your healing, and for the curse to be broken‚Äîthat you might return to yourself, whole and at peace in God‚Äôs light.‚Äù

Giacomo hugged him and gave heartfelt thanks to each of them. Then he and Julius left the church, sunlight breaking through the clouds as they stepped outside.

He felt clean‚Äîcleansed by confession, by truth, and by the grace of forgiveness. But he was scared. Claw was a terrifying enemy. The stakes were as high as they could be.

Still, he felt supported. Blessed. He had friends in Julius, in Monsignor Logan, and in the angels. But most importantly, he had seen his grandfather‚Äîthe man who once defeated Fang and had passed down to him the magic axe.

Maybe history would repeat itself.

Giacomo was ready.

Chapter 6: The Dream Match

Friday morning, Giacomo woke up at 8 a.m. and ran five miles. He wasn‚Äôt trying to stay in shape‚Äîhe was trying to exhaust himself so he could fall asleep early that night. He was anxious to possess his inheritance: the magic silver axe he would use to take down Claw and free himself once and for all.

His heart beat faster‚Äînot from the run, but from his nerves.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said to himself. ‚ÄúYou can do this.‚Äù

Julius had promised to act as his second. As a Dream Walker, Julius had the rare power to enter the dreams of others.

Giacomo ate light‚Äîjust one meal around noon. He fried up some chopped beef from the fridge and made himself a small salad with lettuce and red vinegar. That was it. He wanted to stay hungry. He couldn‚Äôt wait to fall asleep.

By 10 p.m., he lay down. His eyes were heavy, and he wasn‚Äôt fighting it. He rolled onto his side and, within minutes, he was standing next to Julius in Catania, Sicily, at the foot of the volcano.

There it was‚Äîhis grandfather‚Äôs glass house, just as he had imagined.

He turned the doorknob and stepped inside. There, just as promised, was Octavio‚Äôs axe‚Äîsilver-bladed, gleaming. He held it for the first time. It was heavier than he thought, and he needed both hands to lift it.

‚ÄúSteady,‚Äù Julius said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one thing these werewolves fear most in the world.‚Äù

Giacomo took a deep breath, encouraged.

They stepped outside. It was time.

They walked to the edge of the forest, to a clearing lit by moonlight. Across the way, something rustled in the trees. Claw emerged, towering, snarling, with a second werewolf beside him named Bite.

Behind Giacomo, he could see the angelic glow of Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva. Their presence felt like the answer to a prayer.

Julius whispered steady encouragement. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got Octavio‚Äôs blood in you.‚Äù

Giacomo wasn‚Äôt afraid‚Äîbut he wasn‚Äôt overconfident, either. He wasn‚Äôt a fighter like Julius, a seasoned ghost-wrestler.

‚ÄúRemember to summon the shadows, like I taught you,‚Äù Julius said.

There was no time left to delay.

Claw was already in the center of the clearing, sniffing blood.

As Giacomo approached, axe in hand, it felt heavier with each step. His legs were shaky. He fought not to let Claw see his fear‚Äîwhich was tipping into panic.

But Claw didn‚Äôt need to see it. He could smell it. His confidence grew.

He would avenge his grandfather Fang and free his tribe from the forest‚Äôs depths to raid the villagers once more.

They circled each other. Claw beckoned him.

‚ÄúDrop the axe, and I‚Äôll make this quick. Hold onto it, and it‚Äôll be slow.‚Äù

Giacomo considered it. But instead of cowering, he swung the axe at Claw‚Äôs head with both hands.

Claw countered fast and hard. His sharp hooves struck Giacomo‚Äôs legs, sending him to the ground. Giacomo rolled back to his feet, trying to angle the axe to create Octavio‚Äôs forcefield‚Äîbut it wouldn‚Äôt work.

Claw saw the struggle and pressed harder. He pounced, pinning Giacomo to the ground.

Julius shouted encouragement, but it was fading. Giacomo summoned the shadows from the trees‚Äîan old trick Julius had taught him. The tendrils wrapped around Claw‚Äôs thighs. But Claw was too strong. That move worked on ghosts, not werewolves.

Giacomo began to lose hope. He couldn‚Äôt match Claw. The axe felt useless. His limbs trembled. Panic overtook him.

Claw loomed above, laughing‚Äîa deep, savage howl.

‚ÄúHow could this be Octavio‚Äôs grandson?‚Äù he sneered.

Claw raised his clawed arm, ready to strike.

Giacomo went still. The axe was nearby, but why bother? ‚ÄúJust get it over with,‚Äù he whispered, resigned.

But then he prayed.

God, please.

Suddenly, Mateo reached beneath his robe and produced Giacomo‚Äôs old backpack‚Äîthe one filled with the Heavenly power he had siphoned from the four guardians. Mateo opened it slightly and tossed it underhand toward Giacomo.

The pack landed beside him, glowing.

Giacomo grabbed it and pressed it to his chest. The light surged into him. He stopped shaking.

Claw, momentarily confused, hesitated.

Giacomo seized the moment. He reached for the axe‚Äînow light as a feather‚Äîand, with a cry from deep within, struck Claw down. A clean blow, right between the eyes.

Claw collapsed.

Giacomo sat up in bed, gasping.

It was over. The nightmare. The fear.

It had all been in his head.

But he had stood up to it‚Äîwith prayer, with courage.

And he had won.

‚∏ª

Saturday Morning

He fell back asleep and woke again around 10 a.m. The sun was bright.

For the first time, he felt the world was his again‚Äù

He had toast and jogged to Tompkins Square Park.

There was Julius on the handball court, dominating a pair of sixty-year-old brothers‚Äîtwo on one.

When Julius spotted Giacomo, he let the ball drop. ‚ÄúYou guys win,‚Äù he called.

He walked over. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all proud of you, you know. Especially Octavio. He was there all along. He put the axe back in the glass house after you were done with it. Didn‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be any more use for it.‚Äù

Giacomo smiled and shook his hand. ‚ÄúThank you. You‚Äôre a great second. I had my first good night‚Äôs sleep in a year.
I felt lighter, as if the weight of a thousand nightmares had lifted.‚Äù

Julius threw an arm around his shoulder.

Two friends. A normal morning. At last.

**Chapter X**

**Halloween**

It was Halloween and Astral was with Ariane, Ukiko, and Lucifer as they made their way to the neighborhood Halloween party. Ariane was, as she had stated, dressed as Moon Warrior Lunalia and was absolutely excited to see other young children dressed as characters from the show. Ukiko was dressed as Madam Neko‚Äôs earlier hero persona ‚ÄúBlack-Fire‚Äù and was dressed in a sleek black form fitting suit with tufts of black fur and fake flames on her fingertips. Astral was desperately trying not to get caught staring for too long, but failing miserably. Astral was dressed as one ‚ÄúDetective Layton‚Äù from a decades old puzzle game series and he was quite proud of it. Lucifer was not dressed as anyone or anything, but kept getting very random guesses.

When they first entered Astral was drawn to a corner where a group of men were standing in what he had hoped were their costumes, a drink in each hand. He approached and nodded to each of the men, neighbors he had only greeted in passing until now.

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre the guy who bought the yokai house!‚Äù An older man in a white t-shirt and jeans smiled. ‚ÄúWelcome, I hear you‚Äôre a busy guy!‚Äù 

Astral nodded as he realized the man was attempting a thick Texan accent. ‚ÄúYeah. Hero work and investigations.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI meant the kid.‚Äù He laughed, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got to be a handful.‚Äù

One of the other men in a black shirt nodded and said something so unintelligible that Astral could only stare.

A third one shook his head, he was wearing a red baseball cap and mirrored sunglasses with a button down shirt, jeans and work boots. ‚ÄúKiro, He‚Äôs not in on it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, sorry.‚Äù The second man smirked, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to stay in character. Just waiting for our ‚ÄòBill‚Äô to come back.‚Äù 

Astral stared at the men, ‚ÄúI have no idea who you three are.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame, you some old book character?‚Äù Kiro asked.

‚ÄúDetective Layton, actually.‚Äù Astral corrected, ‚ÄúVideo game detective.‚Äù 

The men looked at each other and shrugged.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm Tohru.‚Äù The first man extended his hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing _King of The Hill_.‚Äù

Astral shrugged. 

‚ÄúOld American TV series. It‚Äôs the best!‚Äù The third man laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Oki by the way.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAstral Freiheight.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúYou guys at least look like you‚Äôre having fun.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs great, bet you must miss the American Traditions, huh?‚Äù Oki nodded, ‚ÄúWe could set something up if you want, for next year.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to change anything. Might take Ari and Ukiko to America for it next year.‚Äù 

The men nodded before Tohru spoke up, ‚ÄúYour kid‚Äôs a great help. You should be proud.‚Äù 

Astral smiled and nodded before he wandered away and shook his head in disappointment. He wandered up to Ukiko, who was talking with a group of young men and women with a singular older woman at the center. Astral watched everyone as their eyes were glued to her frame. A few of the young men gave approving nods to Astral, he just stared back, or at her if he could. 

‚ÄúAstral!‚Äù Ukiko turned to see him, ‚ÄúThis is Mrs. Shotan. She runs the corner store.‚Äù 

The older woman was dressed in a nun‚Äôs outfit and bowed to him. Astral smiled and bowed back.

‚ÄúUkiko was just telling us how you‚Äôre adapting to Japan.‚Äù Mrs. Shotan smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear our country sits well with you.‚Äù 

Astral paused and parsed the woman‚Äôs words before smiling and nodding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad it has been so generous to me.‚Äù 

Mrs. Shotan raised an eyebrow in what Astral assumed was approval, but she then smiled and laughed. ‚ÄúWe are glad to have you here young man. I hope your family grows strong here.‚Äù 

Astral watched Ukiko nearly choke on her drink and he quickly pulled it away as she ran off to the restroom. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still working somethings out.‚Äù Astral smiled, ‚ÄúThank you though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYour kid is definitely a bundle of energy.‚Äù A young woman about the age of seventeen said, ‚ÄúShe bee-lined for the other kids.‚Äù

Astral looked over at Ariane who was with a group of kids that looked around her age. Each one was dressed as a cartoon character. He even recognized a homemade ‚ÄúHighlight The Ninja‚Äù costume. The children were all sharing stories and candy, Ariane was currently telling a story that had them all enthralled as she made emphasizing motions and mimed out parts. 

Astral nodded and looked back to the group around the older woman. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the best.‚Äù Astral smiled and made his way to Ariane‚Äôs group.

‚ÄúAnd then Teddy scared the pop-sessed bad-man into being normal!‚Äù Ariane looked up and smiled, ‚ÄúAnd Papa Aster made them not pop-sessed!‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope Ari‚Äôs stories are fun.‚Äù Astral smiled.

Most of the children nodded and cheered, but one seemed focused and not on Ariane. Astral pulled up a chair and let Ariane continue to regale the other children with stories of how he had protected the city from ‚Äúbad-men‚Äù and helped a school. He wasn‚Äôt sure how she knew as much as she did, but imagined it was either a ghost or Lucifer to blame and either way he wasn‚Äôt going to get anything out of trying to find out. Then all the kids stood up as one of the parents called out for a game.

The kids all scrambled to a central pinata and were told the rules. The children formed a line and each one got a swing at it. When it burst open they could divide and split the candy how they wished. Astrals hook his head at how orderly the chaotic party game of ages past had been made.

‚ÄúThey look like they‚Äôre having fun.‚Äù Ukiko said as she pulled a chair next to his. ‚ÄúAri having fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúAri is the star of the show.‚Äù Astral smiled. 

Then one of the kids pushed another kid down and shouted. ‚ÄúHe has powers! He can‚Äôt play!‚Äù 

Astral recognized the kid who was pushed as the one who had been focusing intently. He got up and so did Ukiko, as they did so two other parents swooped in and picked up the kid with powers. Astral nodded for Ukiko to handle the situation with the mob of kids as Ariane was now getting upset. He went after the parents and kid. He had to move fast and in the end he caught them just as they were leaving the front room of the community center. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù He used his wings to get in front of them. He watched the child‚Äôs face spread in gleeful surprise. 

‚ÄúHe has wings.‚Äù The boy said in shock.

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúAnd powers. So does Ari.‚Äù 

The parents of the boy looked both ashamed and confused.

‚ÄúI know you want to protect him, but if you go, you‚Äôre telling him that boy is right.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúThat it‚Äôs not good to be different. Trust me, that‚Äôs not a message any kid needs to hear.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù The father sighed, ‚ÄúThis is Japan.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou got heroes. You got mutants. You got Rana. You got yokai.‚Äù Astral countered, ‚ÄúEach group is different and each group contributes, but when someone has a difference like a power, you should be encouraging the growth of that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI make fire.‚Äù The boy said. ‚ÄúI try very hard to keep it in.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, ‚ÄúI get that, fire‚Äôs neat, but it can be dangerous.‚Äù 

The boy nodded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have many toys anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like some help?‚Äù Astral asked.

The boy nodded and looked up at his parents. His mother nodded and then his father. 

Astral kneeled down and smiled as he spoke a word of Babel, it was a binding word but his focus on it was more of a definition of guidance. The Word would restrain his power until he could freely control it without strain. The boy looked at Astral in confusion for a moment.

‚ÄúTry not focusing.‚Äù Astral smiled and nodded.

The boy seemed to relax and then looked around him in surprise. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs on fire?‚Äù 

Astral nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll grow with you, but that means you need to learn how it works.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù The father smiled, ‚ÄúBut...‚Äù 

The boy‚Äôs mother picked him up, ‚ÄúWe should return, he has kids to make friends with.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, and bully to pop in the mouth!‚Äù The boy laughed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about kids like that.‚Äù Astral laughed, ‚ÄúTrust me, my little Ari has likely already chewed him out.‚Äù

Astral watched as the mother and son returned. The father remained behind and looked at him, some shame fading but some remaining. 

‚ÄúSometimes we forget to be more open.‚Äù The man nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôre a good man. We need that.‚Äù 

Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúI grew up being told I was special, but not among my own kind. It was a warped message. Just get the kid into classes for powers.‚Äù 

The man nodded. ‚ÄúKyou Ishikawa.‚Äù He extended his hand and Astral shook it.

‚ÄúAstral Freiheight.‚Äù Astral introduced himself. ‚ÄúIf he ever wants to hang out with Ari, he‚Äôs more than welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill she be okay with that?‚Äù Kyou asked.

Astral belted out a deep laugh. ‚ÄúIf she hasn‚Äôt made him her best friend by the hour's end, I‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù 

Astral walked back in with the other father and watched as Ariane was talking both with the young boy who was pushed and the bully. Ukiko sidled up by Astral as the watched, a giant smile on her face.

‚ÄúShe wants everyone to be friends.‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the power of the Moon, apparently.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow else do you protect everyone's heart?‚Äù Astral watched as the two young boys bowed to each other and exchanged a few pieces of candy.  

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs adorable.‚Äù Ukiko grinned and led Astral over to a group of men and women talking to Lucifer. Lucifer was looking more annoyed than anything but he was hiding it well. ‚ÄúBut this is precious.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHello Ukiko, Astral.‚Äù Lucifer looked up, ‚ÄúI was just talking with this fine group about costumes. They keep guessing at mine. Care to help?‚Äù 

Ukiko shook her head and walked away with a riotous laugh.  

Astral sighed, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to get on her bad side now?‚Äù 

Lucifer just shrugged, ‚ÄúI assume it was to do with the risking of my life with the recent events.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the Mad Hatter, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù A woman dressed as an old maid asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly, there isn‚Äôt a measurement tag on that hat.‚Äù An older man snapped. ‚ÄúClearly he‚Äôs the Monopoly guy!‚Äù 


Lucifer tapped his top hat he had set on his lap. ‚ÄúObservant lot, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell then he‚Äôs a butler.‚Äù Another suggested. ‚ÄúNo mustache!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Astral shook his head.

‚ÄúSee, he's guessed all our costumes.‚Äù Another woman said. She was dressed as a green witch and was glaring at Lucifer. ‚ÄúBut he keeps insisting we‚Äôre all wrong.‚Äù 

‚ÄúElphaba is a bit miffed.‚Äù Lucifer grinned.

‚ÄúI say he‚Äôs some sort of special agent.‚Äù The woman dressed as the witch said. ‚ÄúWho is right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI mean, come on. It‚Äôs easy.‚Äù Astral smirked.

‚ÄúIt really is.‚Äù Lucifer sighed.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the Devil.‚Äù Astral said. ‚ÄúLook at how well dressed he is, how smug he is.‚Äù 

Lucifer glared at Astral for a moment, but smiled, ‚ÄúI am a man of wealth and taste.‚Äù He nodded.

The gathered people all groaned and agreed with a shout of ‚ÄúFailure!‚Äù

Astral and Lucifer both flinched as Lucifer stood up and walked out of what was now clearly some form of guessing game arena. 

Lucifer just put his hat on and raised fingers. ‚ÄúI will admit, that was clever, but not one word.‚Äù 

Astral grinned and nodded as the two went to get a drink and find Ukiko and Ariane once again.

After another hour the four left the community center laughing and joking. Then as they approached the end of the parking lot Lucifer paused and watched his student and his family walk off. He was about to spread his wings and head off when he heard Astral shout out.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Astral shook his head. ‚ÄúNo moping tonight, you stay with family!‚Äù 

Lucifer looked around in confusion and pointed to himself.

‚ÄúYes you!‚Äù Ukiko rolled her eyes. 

Lucifer blinked in shock.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Unca Luci!‚Äù Ariane shouted, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt have all the fun without you!‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe Moon Warrior has spoken.‚Äù Astral shrugged, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt argue.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI suppose I can‚Äôt.‚Äù Lucifer tried his best to not let his eyes get misty, but he failed quite spectacularly and had to wipe them as he approached.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

A little later that night Astral was returning from the twenty four hour corner mart when he was drawn to look up. There clinging to the top of a light pole was a namahage gripping the top in absolute fear. The yokai looked down and whimpered.

‚ÄúAre they gone?‚Äù The yokai was covered in light scars and cuts.

Astral clucked his tongue as he sat down the bag of groceries and flew up to the yokai. A smile spread on his face as he did so.

‚ÄúYou met the ghost mamas, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Astral asked as he rolled up the sleeves of his costume.

The namahage nodded in sheer panic. ‚ÄúBeen chasing me for weeks!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell you did try to eat the wrong little girl.‚Äù Astral nodded.

‚ÄúI figured as much!‚Äù The yokai snapped and paused as realization dawned on him.

‚ÄúHonestly...‚Äù Astral pulled back his fist, ‚ÄúYou were safer with them.‚Äù He unleashed a blast of divine light through a powerful punch to the homicidal yokai‚Äôs face. As the body fell it turned to ash and blew away in a light breeze.

Astral landed and looked around. Multiple other yokai were watching, most were harmless and cheering on the demise of the cruel yokai, but a few slunk off into darkness and Astral looked off towards the mountains of Japan. His gaze went to the direction of Mount Fuji, he felt something strong waking up in that direction and knew it was only a matter of time, but he would let that come to him, it was never good to chase wounded animals to their lairs. 

He laughed and shook his head as he began to walk back home. He had been sent for some more beer for Ukiko and juice boxes for Ariane, as well as some popcorn for late night movies. He just hadn‚Äôt expected to find something as stupid as he had just encountered. Still the night had delivered to him a pleasant evening with his two favorite girls and his teacher. 

Life was looking up.

Perfection: I was referring to Cousin Eddie last chapter. National Lampoon's Cousin Eddie, who is in effect that one weird uncle.

Smoggy: Might have been too good a Pinky-ism.

Perfection: So, and stay with me here, Lucifer is an ultimately pleasant but tragic figure who has made a family in an ultimately loving And functioning family. He is the weird uncle but also because he is an angel he is more like Astral‚Äôs weird cousin, like Cousin Eddie. Cousin Eddie also stayed with his family for a time at Christmas, which is the next time hop here, and famously ruined his cousin's  sewage system with his RV. Lucifer would never do that. It's too rude.

Smoggy: You get all that?  Good.

Wraith: Sure thing Lord Helmet.

Smoggy: Look he was cooking my brain barely kept up.

Perfection:  There was an overheat warning.

Smoggy: Anyway, very early post so I can enjoy my birthday tomorrow!

The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of a potential bull run in 2025, and there are several reasons behind this expectation:

**Growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum**: Bitcoin is expected to reach $150,000 and Ethereum $10,000, signaling strong bullish momentum.

**Market capitalization increase**: Analysts predict that the total crypto market cap could surpass $5 trillion, and possibly even hit $10 trillion during this cycle.

**Institutional adoption**: Major investors and companies are entering the market, boosting confidence and adding stability to the crypto space.

**Favorable political factors**: A pro-crypto U.S. administration and the approval of Bitcoin-backed ETFs are creating a safer environment for investments.

**Additional catalysts**: Gold has surpassed $3,000, showing a global appetite for safe-haven assets, and there are ongoing discussions about massive BTC purchases by governments and sovereign wealth funds.

If these trends continue, we could witness a bull run that redefines the crypto ecosystem.

I have tried to stop and whenever i do it feels good but i eventually go back to stealing small things, food, water, which builds up to expensive items. I dont sell anything i just keep it. Its not a high for me i just need to do it. Its so easy why pay for things (which i already struggle with since i rely on my mother for food and when i am not ontime for school/work, which is often because i am depressed, i dont get to eat that day.) i dont get an allowance and i volunteer at multiple human rights organizations. I pay my union dues. I live off of prescription medication, iced coffee, and any food in the house. 

I dont know why i steal. I would be ok with myself stealing if it was just necessity but i steal collectibles and puzzles and just stuff to entertain me. Its hard to control or stop myself because of my adhd. Im a law student ontop of it im terrified of being caught. I dont know what to do anymore i dont wanna ruin my life over a non-addiction ive been stealing less but thats just because ive stolen everything I would want. I cant stop. I went 3 months one time and it ended in a Su!cid3 attempt which made me run away to my dads house where a few months later of casually stealing from stores and him, he beat me up when i told him i was fully out as a man and hes the only one who doesnt respect it. I was told to ‚Äúfight him like a man‚Äù i tried to jump out the window but i was too weak from the injuries. I see him now and then. Im back living with my mom which is a nightmare ive lost alot of weight. I contacted cps twice and both times they made everything worse. Any advice would be amazing i dont know what to do anymore. The only happiness in my life is late night walks (that i often get in trouble for), my work, my ldr, and my friends. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

No i cant move out i would be homeless i live in a big city same city i go to college in.

1kwnnpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kwnnpw/why_choose_the_graco_verb_travel_system_stroller/,Why Choose the Graco Verb Travel System Stroller Review for Your Baby?,"The Graco 2215507 Verb Travel System is a trusted companion for parents seeking a lightweight stroller and car seat combination that simplifies daily commutes with their little one. Having tested it extensively over the past few weeks, I feel equipped to dive into the features, pros, and limitations of this product. It's certainly a strong contender in the baby gear category, but there are a few details worth examining before making a purchase.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This travel system struck me instantly with its thoughtful, lightweight design. Weighing under 20 pounds, the stroller is exceptionally easy to maneuver and fold, even when you're holding a squirming baby in your other arm. It's crafted from sturdy aluminum and polyester, ensuring a durable yet portable framework. The minimalist aesthetic in the ""Merrick"" colorway is sleek, lending a modern, clean vibe to the setup. A standout feature for me is its self-standing fold mechanism, which eliminates the annoying struggle of finding a wall to lean it against. The included carry strap is a lifesaver when loading it into the trunk.

**Comfort for Baby and Parent**  
It didn't take long to notice how comfortable the system is for both baby and caregiver. The multi-position reclining seat offers adaptability for naps, and the 5-point harness, combined with adjustable height settings, ensures secure seating for infants between 4 and 30 pounds. My niece seemed perfectly content during city strolls and long park detours. On my end, the storage basket beneath is wonderfully spacious, capable of holding diapers, a diaper bag, snacks, and personal essentials with ease. Parent-specific perks like the tray with cup holders also came in handy for stashing my morning coffee and car keys.

**Performance on the Go**  
Navigating different terrains‚Äîsidewalks, gravel paths, and smoother indoor surfaces‚Äîwas a breeze thanks to the stroller's suspension system. The locking front swivel wheel is another jewel in its crown, providing effortless steering whether weaving around tight grocery aisles or taking longer outdoor walks. While the plastic tires perform well overall, they aren't ideal for extremely rough surfaces, which I noticed during a recent hiking trail adventure. 

[Check Graco 2215507 Verb Travel System price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07b7qc71x/)  

**Ease of Use**  
The one-step secure attachment of the Graco SnugRide Lite Infant Car Seat to the stroller is perfection. It clicks into place with impressive ease, saving those precious seconds when you're strapped for time. Installing the car seat in my vehicle wasn‚Äôt complicated either, as it features a straightforward setup compatible with rear-facing infants up to 30 pounds. Folding the stroller with one hand after an exhausting day? Absolute magic‚Äîthis feature alone has enhanced outings with my son.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight frame makes it highly portable.  
- Roomy storage basket accommodates larger bags with ease.  
- One-handed folding mechanism simplifies packing.  
- Smooth suspension provides a comfortable ride for infants.  

**Potential Drawbacks**  
Considering its many positives, there are still areas where this product could improve.  

- The plastic wheels do not handle rugged terrains as effectively as rubberized alternatives.  
- The seat's slightly narrow structure might feel snug for heavier toddlers nearing the weight limit.  
- While the Merrick colorway is stylish, it's prone to light scuffs and dirt marks over time.

**Competing Products**  
Venturing into the lightweight stroller and car seat combo market, a few alternatives are worth mentioning. The Chicco Bravo Travel System offers extended wheel durability and a slightly more flexible reclining system. Comparatively, however, its folding mechanism feels bulkier and less user-friendly for quick errands. On the more budget-friendly side, the Evenflo Pivot Modular Travel System provides value but leans heavier, making extended outings a bit cumbersome.

Between these competing options, the Graco Verb Travel System shines with its seamless car seat integration and commuter-friendly design. Though the wheels‚Äô material makes it less ideal for unconventional terrains, families prioritizing portability and convenience over multiterrain versatility will likely find it an excellent substitute.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Evaluating the price-to-quality ratio, it performs exceptionally well against other strollers in a similar category. There's no need to splurge on premium models when this delivers robust durability, ease of use, and practical convenience. The balance between affordability and advanced features speaks highly of its value for money. Most parents on a moderate budget could confidently choose this without compromising usability or comfort.

1kwnn5o,https://i.redd.it/cuhfwhrovb3f1.jpeg,Pink Papayo? A surprise discovery on our Colombian coffee farm,"At our farm in Colombia, we grow an exotic variety called Papayo or ombligon. This Bourbon Papayo usually produces red cherries and is known for its unique flavor: sweet, fruity, with a touch of spice.

But this harvest, in a new lot, something unexpected happened: some plants started producing pinkish-orange cherries ‚Äî a soft, bright color we had never seen before in this variety.

At first, we thought: *Is it just a color change?*  
But then we measured the sugar content using a refractometer (a tool that shows Brix degrees, or how much sugar is in the fruit), and we found out that these pink cherries have more sugar than the red ones.

That might not sound like much, but it could completely change the flavor of the coffee.

So now, we‚Äôre separating these plants, picking their cherries apart from the others, and planning individual fermentations and cuppings. We want to find out if the extra sugar and color bring a new flavor:

* Will it be more floral?
* Sweeter?
* Have more body?
* Or just be different?

The most exciting part is that this could be a natural genetic mutation ‚Äî something rare but possible in coffee. And if the flavor turns out to be truly special, it might take years to develop a full lot of this new ‚ÄúPink Papayo‚Äù: selecting plants, reproducing them, testing them, and stabilizing the flavor and behavior.

It‚Äôs a long journey, but that‚Äôs part of what makes specialty coffee so magical: every bean can have its own story.",10,1748353497.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Outside, rain taps gently on the windows. Inside, the air feels like a cage.

# Two Years Ago ‚Äî Avalora Institute of Excellence

The dusty little internet caf√© smelled of stale coffee and hope. Nyra‚Äôs breath caught in her throat as the page loaded, digits flickering across the screen.

Rank 27.

A door creaks. The present rushes in.

He says nothing. Just turns away, the air heavy with unsaid words.

Nothing is said. Nothing is ever said.

# Avalora ‚Äî The Rain

The sky wept as Nyra walked beside Kairen, her shoes sinking into the muddy path. She told him everything‚ÄîLior‚Äôs gentle heart, her father‚Äôs expectations, the weight that crushed her chest.

Kairen listened, silent, steady.

*""You don‚Äôt have to carry the whole world, Nyra.""*

*But I do... don‚Äôt I?*

Night falls in Narellia Mansion.

Nyra sits alone, staring into the mirror. The reflection is someone she doesn‚Äôt recognize‚Äîfaded, broken.

Her fingers tremble as she opens a forgotten notebook. A drawing of stars. A note from Kairen, written in a gentle scrawl:  
*""If you ever forget who you are‚Äîlook up.""*

A tear slips down her cheek.

*""I remember,""* she whispers.

**TL;DR:**  
A noble clan‚Äôs daughter trapped in a loveless marriage. Bruised, broken, and silenced. But a forgotten promise and a whispered name pull her back from the edge. Nyra Velorin forgot how to breathe ‚Äî until she remembered who she truly is.

I‚Äôm Sofia, a 26-year-old creative currently working as a freelance designer with a love for minimal aesthetics, smart UX, and a touch of storytelling in everything I do. I‚Äôm based mostly in Eastern Europe wherever the mood and Wi-Fi are good, but I like to move around when I can ‚Äî fresh places give me fresh ideas.



I started my design journey back in university, and after a few years in an agency, I went solo. Since then, I‚Äôve worked with startups, small brands, and personal projects ‚Äî doing everything from logos and packaging to full-on brand identity systems. I‚Äôm especially drawn to projects that have meaning, depth, or a good cause behind them.



Aside from design, I‚Äôm into:



Journaling and mind-mapping weird business ideas



Photography (mostly moody city shots and texture close-ups)



Hiking when I need a reset



Tea over coffee (don‚Äôt hate me)



Reddit‚Äôs always been a quiet source of inspiration for me ‚Äî from r/freelance horror stories to amazing feedback threads on r/design. I‚Äôm here now to be part of the conversation, share what I‚Äôve learned, ask better questions, and maybe connect with other creatives out there doing their thing.

Hi guys and gals

Assalamualaikum 
I lived with my wife and in-laws for a few months and I realised my mother in law is a control freak. 

She asks me and my wife about our spending, anything we buy she wants to know the price and how much. I got a job recently and she and my in laws asked my salary. I don‚Äôt mind sharing cos whatever they usually ask nicely but after seeing how much they interfere and how nosey they are, them wanting to control how I spend my money I am starting to get irritated. 

They even ask me if I bought lunch today on most days just to see if I spend any money. My wife must have told them I love coffee and they ask me everyday if I bought coffee outside. They instead say I should buy from supermarket and make my own to save money. Smart but tastes like rocks and gives me no energy to focus on work.

They are always talking about money and how poor they are and how everything is so expensive. I get it but they‚Äôre also now much more well off vs 20 years ago. They lived an extremely frugal life as fil was the sole earner looking after 5 kids. But they want me and my wife to live the same standards as them.

This is controlling and out of line right? My wife lived with me and my parents for a bit too and my parents never controlled her or how and where she spent her money except they did ask us to leave when they found out my wife was giving her salary to her parents to pay off their mortgage. I was okay with it because they agreed they would sell one of their houses and help us buy ours.

Anyway I‚Äôm thinking of telling my wife that there needs to be some boundaries. They can‚Äôt keep asking about my salary. They can‚Äôt keep asking me how I spend my money. They can‚Äôt keep treating me like a kid and tell me how I manage my finances. They‚Äôve got a grown ass daughter who‚Äôs married. They should back off.

Fair? Or AITA?

Also I don‚Äôt want them to live near us in the future I feel like she‚Äôd be over our house all the time and interfere even more. Maybe a good distance I think would be atleast an hour or away if not another city entirely so they‚Äôd think twice before coming over as it would cos them money for getting to ours.

Is this fair too or am I being unreasonable?

There's something incredibly satisfying about transforming a tired, outdated piece of furniture into a modern showstopper‚Äîespecially when it doesn‚Äôt involve endless prep work. That‚Äôs where¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†comes in.

Whether you're a seasoned DIYer or just getting started with home projects,¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†makes refinishing furniture easy, fast, and fun. No stripping, no sanding, and no priming required‚Äîjust results you'll love. Today, we‚Äôre giving an old coffee table a sleek, dramatic makeover using the color¬†[Licorice](https://beyondpaint.com/products/licorice), a rich, true matte black that adds instant sophistication to any space.

Supplies You‚Äôll Need:

\-¬†[Beyond Paint in Licorice](https://beyondpaint.com/products/licorice)¬†¬†

\- 3/8‚Äù microfiber roller¬†¬†

\- General degreaser¬†¬†

\- Cloth rag¬†¬†

\- Spray paint for hardware (optional)



**Step 1: Prep Like a Pro (Without the Hassle)**

Before you pop open your paint, it‚Äôs important to start with a clean surface. This step helps ensure proper adhesion and gives you the best results possible.

Spray your table with a general-purpose degreaser, then wipe it down with a cloth rag. No sanding or stripping necessary‚Äîjust a clean surface and you're good to go. This alone makes¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†a game-changer for anyone short on time or tired of labor-intensive DIYs.



**Step 2: Open and Stir Your Paint**

Before opening your container, give it a good shake.¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†comes with a foil seal and a second protective layer underneath, so make sure to remove both before stirring. This formula is designed to be ready-to-go, combining bonder, primer, and sealer all in one. That means fewer products, fewer steps, and less mess.



**Step 3: Apply the First Coat with Your Microfiber Roller**

Here comes the fun part‚Äîpainting! Using your 3/8"" microfiber roller, begin applying¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†to the surface. One of the standout benefits of this paint is how it self-levels, eliminating brush marks and roller streaks. You can roll in any direction and still get a smooth, professional-looking finish.

If you‚Äôve ever felt intimidated by furniture refinishing,¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†will completely change your mind. It's forgiving, consistent, and made for real-life projects‚Äîno artistic background required.



**Step 4: Let It Dry and Tackle the Hardware**

While your first coat dries (typically within 2 to 4 hours), this is a great time to update the hardware. A simple coat of spray paint on handles or knobs can make all the difference in the final look. It‚Äôs a small touch that ties the whole project together.



**Step 5: Apply the Second Coat**

After the first layer is fully dry, go in with your second coat. This is when the true depth and richness of the¬†[Licorice](https://beyondpaint.com/products/licorice)¬†color really come to life. Deep, matte black with a sleek, modern vibe‚Äîit‚Äôs bold without being overpowering, and it‚Äôs incredibly versatile for various home styles.

Again, use your microfiber roller for a flawless application. Because¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†has built-in sealing properties, there‚Äôs no need for an extra topcoat. Your surface is protected and ready to handle daily wear and tear.



**Step 6: Reinstall Hardware and Admire Your Work**

Once your second coat has dried completely, reinstall your hardware and take a step back. What once was an outdated, overlooked coffee table is now a stunning, statement-making piece.



**Why DIYers Love Beyond Paint**

What sets our paint apart is its all-in-one formula and no-fuss application. There‚Äôs no sanding, stripping, or priming involved, which saves you hours of prep and clean-up. It‚Äôs perfect for cabinets, countertops, furniture, and more‚Äîand it delivers professional-level results even for beginners.

Plus, when you use a microfiber roller, the application is smooth and even, making the process practically foolproof. Whether you're refinishing a table, dresser, kitchen island, or built-in shelving,¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†empowers you to take on those projects with confidence.



**Ready to Try It Yourself?**

If you‚Äôre inspired to give your furniture a fresh look, grab a can of¬†[Beyond Paint](https://beyondpaint.com/)¬†and a microfiber roller, and get started today.

Today was‚Ä¶ surprisingly wholesome.

The CEO of our US partner company arrived in the Philippines to check out the research lab, and I ended up joining him for lunch and dinner meetings. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect‚Äîstiff suits and awkward tech talk maybe‚Äîbut nah. Dude‚Äôs actually cool. Down-to-earth. Sharp. And weirdly? Kind of a kindred spirit.

Turns out, we both learned piano for a girl.
Yeah. That‚Äôs right. We both became emotionally expressive artists for someone who didn‚Äôt like us back.

Me?
I asked her what her favorite song was. Learned it‚Äînote for note‚Äîso I could use it to confess.
But by the time I finally nailed it‚Ä¶ she had a boyfriend.
Cue the end credits: ‚ÄúRomantic Effort.exe has crashed unexpectedly.‚Äù

As for him?
His crush liked the movie Secret, so he thought, ‚ÄúAh, I‚Äôll learn the iconic time-travel song on piano. She‚Äôll love it.‚Äù
Turns out‚Ä¶
She didn‚Äôt care about the piano.
She just liked Jay Chou.
The man was out there learning metaphysical melodies and she was just vibing to the actor.

Cue the universal theme song of romantic overachievers everywhere:
‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs for you‚Ä¶ oh, you didn‚Äôt ask? Never mind.‚Äù

But the best part?
He told me how he met his wife. And it wasn‚Äôt some hyper-curated rom-com storyline. It was chaotic and real and beautiful in its randomness.

They got matched by a common friend.
Met for the first time at the airport and had that immediate vibe check like:
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like a murderer. Nice.‚Äù
They talked for four hours right there.
Then had breakfast with her parents.
Felt guilty, so they had dinner with his.
By the second meetup?
They decided to get married.
Now they‚Äôre expecting a baby boy.

And that hit me.

We spend so much time haunted by the past.
So much time terrified of the future.
But the stuff that changes everything? The things that stick?
They happen in the present.
By being open. Being there. Saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coffee. To airports. To now.

So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm taking with me:

The past doesn‚Äôt get to write the whole story.
And the future? It‚Äôll arrive when it‚Äôs meant to.

All I need to do is show up today‚Äîwith presence, curiosity, and a little bit of piano-induced humility.

And maybe, someday, a story like his won‚Äôt sound so far off.

Imagine bustling streets filled with the delightful aromas of fresh-baked bread, handcrafted soaps, and the intriguing chatter of passionate makers. It‚Äôs like stepping into a living gallery of our local talent, right? But behind this picturesque scene lies the not-so-glamorous world of logistics and planning.

First off, you need to be a bit of a logistician. I know, not the most glamorous title, but bear with me. You‚Äôll need to find the perfect location‚Äîsomewhere that draws a crowd, has ample foot traffic, and, let‚Äôs be honest, isn‚Äôt too far from decent coffee. Because let‚Äôs face it, caffeine is the lifeblood of creativity. Once you pinpoint the spot, you‚Äôll want to secure the necessary permits. Yes, those pesky legalities that make you feel like you‚Äôre wrangling a toddler with a sugar high. It‚Äôs important, though; you want the city‚Äôs ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù so you don‚Äôt end up in a sitcom-worthy chase scene with local authorities.

Next comes the fun part‚Äîreaching out to local makers! This is where your community spirit comes into play. Curate a list of local artisans‚Äîjewelers, bakers, potters, you name it. It‚Äôs like assembling the Avengers, but instead of saving the world, you‚Äôre supporting local economies. Send out invites, and make sure you include all the juicy details: set-up times, the crowd size you anticipate, and, of course, fee structure. Speaking of which, let‚Äôs talk vendor fees.

Vendor fees can be your ticket to a successful market. They should cover your overhead costs, like permits, advertising, and perhaps a little something for your own heart (and stomach) along the way. It‚Äôs essential to strike a balance here, though. Set fees that are manageable for your makers, because if they‚Äôre thrilled to sell their goods and cover your costs, it‚Äôs a win-win. Think of it as offering a stage for their artistry while you earn a little along the way.

Now, as stressful as organizing a pop-up market may seem, it‚Äôs ripe with opportunities for spiritual reflection (I know, there‚Äôs always a twist!). Each conversation with a maker, each interaction with a customer, even the grueling late-night planning sessions? They all weave together in this beautiful tapestry of community. Just like Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 12:12, we are all part of one body‚Äîand this includes our local artisans! 

The emotional arc of your journey as a market organizer will dance between exhilaration and exhaustion, but each emotion serves a purpose. You may find yourself juggling vendor setup and a toddler tantrum (I‚Äôve been there). Just remember that in every chaotic moment, there‚Äôs an opportunity for grace and connection. And at the end of the day, when you see people sharing laughter, purchasing unique creations, and supporting one another, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs all worth it.

So, gather your community, roll up your sleeves, and let‚Äôs create something beautiful. Because there‚Äôs nothing quite like the joy of bringing local makers together, fostering connections, and offering a space where both creativity and faith can flourish. And who knows? You might just end up with a delightful surprise‚Äîlike a new friendship or realizing you‚Äôve discovered your next favorite cookie flavor along the way.

Bit of context: I am a 26F, diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, Migraine, and Functional Neurological Disorder. 

  
Here goes:

* Month 1: got a UTI and got prescribed antibiotics. I have MS so they don't play around with infection but the doctor said, ""The test we just did is negative.""
* Month 2: Again, I go in for a UTI. The quick test is negative again but they prescribe antibiotics.
* Month 3: I try to see an OBGYN to see if they can help and they prescribe me antibiotics to be taken daily and refer me to a Urologist.
* Month 4: I am fine on the daily antibiotic.
* Month 5: The urologist walks into the room and diagnoses me with IC because all my tests for UTI are negative. I am prescribed amitriptyline too but am still taking the daily antibiotic.
* Month 6: I see the urologist to update on how the amytryptyline is working and I tell him that I really feel like the antibiotic is what is helping. He refuses to prescribe me more daily antibiotic. A week later I am done with the daily antibiotic and the UTI symptoms are back really bad. The quick test is negative, but I INSIST they send it off to labs. In the meantime they prescribe 7 days of antibiotics. After this round is complete the symptoms are back so I call the office and tell them. A nurse condescendingly tells me that I need to quit ""eating spicy food and drinking coffee"". I patiently remind her that I am already not doing these things and that I want them to find out the culture results. She tells me they are normal. I burst into tears once I am off the phone. This does not feel like IC. I know it's UTI. She calls me back 10 minutes later, ""I guess there was a page in your results I missed. We prescribed a 15 day course of antibiotics because this infection won't go away with the course you just did."" So I do that course and I am fine again.
* Month 7: I quit the amitriptyline, feeling certain the diagnosis is wrong. I get another UTI and I change urologists because I cannot stand him insisting I have IC. The new urologist looks through my lab culture results and says, ""I've never seen this before. We're going to run a lab culture even though your quick test is negative."" The lab results come back and they put me on the proper antibiotic.
* Month 8: I get another UTI as soon as I am done with the antibiotics. They run the quick test: negative. They run the lab test: negative. They send it off for a ""Microgen"" test. The Microgren test comes back, and it's TWO rare forms of bacteria that they have to treat with two different antibiotics at the same time.
* Month 9: UTIs are gone, finally, and I am on a daily antibiotic and I am fine.
* Month 10: Still taking the daily antibiotic and I am fine.

Listen to your body. Don't trust the quick tests, they're ALWAYS negative for me, and yet, I had really bad bacteria present that it could not pick up. Even if the lab cultures come back negative, do the Microgen test. Sometimes we're right, we know what is wrong with our body and they just aren't performing the right test on us.

We think we are narrowing down the cause of these and they have been looking at my kidneys and bladder structure etc., to get to the bottom of it. But they have officially told me that I DO NOT have IC. This is recurrent UTIs and they must be treated very differently. Hoping this helps someone in a similar situation.

Wishing you ALL doctors that believe you and care for you and trust you whether you suffer with IC or UTI or any other things. We are the experts of our own bodies.

FAQ: 

* What types of bacteria did they find?

Esicherichia coli, Kocuria kristinae, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Klebsiella granulomatis.¬†

* What were your symptoms?

I had pressure and discomfort in my bladder and lower abdomen, burning and pain before and during urination and moments afterwards, feeling the need to urinate even when I did not have any left in my bladder and lots of urgency. A ton of discomfort overall in the bladder with a constant feeling of having to pee no matter what.¬†

* What antibiotics did they treat you with for each bacteria?

All the bacteria I had show up on lab culture: Esicherichia coli, and Kocuria kristinae. For the Esicherichia coli the Macrobid worked but for the Kocuria kristinae they had to switch me to Amox-clav 500-125 mg tablets every 12 hours twice daily.¬† On the Microgen test: Klebsiella pneumonia, and Klebsiella granulomatis. The Microgen bacteria didn't go away until they put me on Ciproflocacin Hcl 250 mg tablets twice daily for 7 days while also taking Clindamycin Hcl 300 mg capsules tier daily for 7 days. 

*  What supplements did you try?

 I am on Cranberry and D-Mannose. I am also on a daily probiotic. I drink cranberry juice (the sour, sugar free kind which tastes kinda bad).

We have hung out casually almost every week or every other week since we started talking. We know each other pretty well. But no 'formal dates'.

I said I'd like a formal date but he says he doesn't like it when things move too fast. Then he basically said he likes his lifestyle at the moment but also enjoys hanging out with me. I thought it was going to be trapped in this zone until I learnt he has told his mum about me and his friends sometimes ask for updates about if he is still speaking to me. I have not any of them yet and that's perfectly OK with me.

I'm happy with slow. But I can't tell if this is slow or if he is trying to decide whether I'm good enough to disrupt his lifestyle. I want to be chosen. I'm not looking to steal time away from him. His usual routine is work, friends, basketball (he does this a lot), and general down time watching movies. He has been in this routine for 2 years. No girlfriends in that time.

I don't think he was looking for a girlfriend. But he did speak to me first. He didn't expect me to talk to him back or be interested in him.

Update - to answer questions...

He's cooked me food a few times and we've been for a quick coffee.

But first i apologise, english is not my first lenguaje so be ready for spelling and grammar mistakes. I will try my best to say everything in the best way possible. 

I (29F) have a boyfriend M (30M). We have been together for almost to years. The things is...i'm at a crossroad right now, and i thinking of breaking up with him.

Past monday we had a bike accident. He was driving and i was the passenger. Well, it rained early and the streets were a little wet, and sadly we sliped and slide for about between 5 to 7 meters on the pavimentet. (We were wearing helmets) The bike broke, my boyfriend hurted his wrist (he is in pain today still), and I hurt my right hand, arm and leg. (cuts, blood, pain, and pretty nasty wounds)

When the accident happened, with the help of the people that came to help (who where passing by) i called  an emergency service, they came and looked at me and him. They told us we were ok. So, in the meanwhile, with my phone (his phone broke on the fall), he called both of our mothers. My mom (59F) came with my uncle (56M) and he hast to reach his mother trught his sister and BIL, who drive her to where we were.  

They left us at a gas station to go to the emergency room asking us to keep and eye on the bike until they come back. My mom, my uncle and me stay there so i could see if my belongins broke (i had my laptop with me, its fine thankfullly, i use it for classes and study), we drank a coffee, call him to tell we were going home. His mother tried to insist we stay there. Keep in mind it was starting to rain and is was at night, at 9 p.m. I was bleeding, my new jeans were cut by the emergency service up to my knee wich was hurting a lot, my arm was totally scraped (i dont know the word for it sorry). Keep in mind that i told him to go because my boyfriend was doing nothing to solve anything. 

I went home and the next day i went to the hospital, my hand was ok, the only thing they did was take off of the wound of my hand a little stone. 

During the week, a lot happend: my boyfriend barely asked if i was ok, he come to see me on Wensday and my mom called his familly and him on they awfull attitude. He was upset. I almost lost a job oportunity (Thankfully not, im doing interviews for it), was hurting and could barely walk and my hand hurt. Couldn't attend class. And my cat went lost for twelve hours before a neighbor found that little rascal and my mom went to his rescue. So saying i had a meltdown because of stress on friday is and understandment. (I'm in therapy so i work this with a professional also)   

That weekend, a friend of us, N, suspended his birthday reunion because a lot o people coulnd't go. At this point i had difficult walking and could't go. I apologise to N and explained the situation, N said that was not a problem. Later that night, after he came back from his father birthday dinner, my boyfriend say...let's do a party for N tomorrow (Saturday). I called him off on this saying it was an AH move and he was inconsideratte. He apologise and told me i was right. I satarted to thing of breaking it off right there. We talked on sunday and figured another things out (aconomics, dinamics, family). Everyhing was kinda alright. 

Yesterday, Monday, i managed to go to a traumatologist (apointment was difficult to make, but he is a good porfesional, he already knows me for other thing i had). The doctor told me i had hurt my ligaments and that was the reason i was having trouble walking. Tolme to trid no to walk and to do another test (radiology, and MRI). And to set another apointment to see what happend. 

M and I had planned for me to stay at his place (there are stairs, and the bathroom is upstairs and so is the bedroom), but with what the doctor told me i say to him that i don't thik i cant make it and asked what would him like to do instead. He told me ""Ah, I don't now, what do you whant to do?"". We talked at night as normal but i can's top thinking about everything. I already told him i was feeling alone in this, and that it was awfull nobody in his family asked us if we needed something. (BIG THANKS AND LOVE TO MY MOM WHO IS STIKING WITH ME NO MATTER WHAT) He has a new phone by the way, and his parents offered to pay for it. Also he already hinted the he could go out alone if he wanted, i told him that of course he can, doing it in this situation will make him an idiot. But don't worry, i will do my thing. 

Im upset, sad, hurt, stressed because job oportunity and finals, and at in doubt of what to do right now and need advice, so a im overreacting?

This because a weekly ritual pretty much, every Saturday or Sunday we‚Äôd all three meet for coffee. 

My new friend started inviting me and the other friend to craft night every Wednesday. I felt a little out of my element but went anyways and enjoyed myself. This group was largely who the first girl played D&D with and I found she was very gatekeepey with that which seems to be a theme.

At some point she quit inviting me to craft night but would still talk about it actively. Or early in the week she would say she would invite me, never heard from her, and then she would repeat the same thing of talking about how much fun it was. I would understand if I somehow said something rude or offensive, but it was literally just crafts so I truly don‚Äôt think it was something I said/did. 

Once I met her alone for coffee and she was telling me about a big event in our city. I knew of a similar type event that occurred more frequently which I pulled up on IG and showed her. At craft night (the last one I attended actually), she tells me she and the group are going to an event she found the next weekend and she shows me the event that I originally showed her.

If you go there at the right time, you can avoid the early morning rush. But arrive too late? You‚Äôre stuck behind a long line of hipsters.

I like the place because it‚Äôs five minutes from my apartment. Just a straight walk out the door and a few minutes later, I‚Äôm sipping the best latte in Southern California.

But the one thing that irks me about the place is the barista, Steve.

He never remembers my name, even though we went to high school together. I mean, sure. People drift apart. Times change. But we were close for a couple years, until he transferred out to another school.

It just seemed odd to reconnect and‚Ä¶no matter how many times I reminded him‚Ä¶he never recalled my name.

This whole ordeal started last summer. I had just started a new job and was eager to impress my boss. I hustled into the cafe, workbag slung over my shoulder, and heard: ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

I recognized the voice instantly. ‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù

Sure enough, Steve was behind the counter, making drinks. He still had that trademark curly hair and thick glasses, like he was straight out of Silicon Valley.

‚ÄúNice to see you, man‚Ä¶‚Äù

We made our reintroductions, and I ordered. Everything seemed normal at first, but when he went to write down my name, he hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. How could I forget?‚Äù

He wrote it down and I paid. That was that.

Weeks turned into months. Steve was there almost every morning. Each time, I‚Äôd have to remind him as confusion spread across his face.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Harry, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Silly me.‚Äù

He‚Äôd scribble my name on the cup, and I‚Äôd play it off. But if I was being honest, it bothered me. And the more it happened, the angrier I got.

One day, I built up enough courage to ask him: ‚ÄúSteve, what‚Äôs going on, man? We‚Äôve interacted for, like, three months. You still don‚Äôt remember my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe hung out every day in high school.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Trippy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs pretty odd.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be a confusing name.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand your frustration. I‚Äôll do better. I promise.‚Äù

I left the shop, annoyed, but satisfied that he‚Äôd sworn to try harder.

That promise didn‚Äôt last long.

The next day, the same thing happened. I was so irritated!

I decided to confront Steve, once and for all, but this time, outside the coffee shop.

I waited in the park across the street. Watched him exit the cafe at four fifteen.

He must‚Äôve lived nearby because he didn‚Äôt climb into any cars or call a rideshare. He just slung his backpack over his shoulder, headed for downtown.

I trailed him for about five blocks before I finally called out. ‚ÄúSteve!‚Äù

He stopped and raked his gaze toward me. ‚ÄúHey! It‚Äôs ‚Äî‚Äù

And then it happened‚Ä¶his mind blanked.

‚Äú‚Äî Harry!‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Right. I‚Äôm sorry. What‚Äôs up, Bud?‚Äù

I hurried to his position, doing my best to act calm.

‚ÄúLook, Steve, this might not be a big deal, but I have to ask. What‚Äôs with the name thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe name thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you remember my name?!‚Äù

At this, Steve‚Äôs eyes widened and his lips twitched. He arched his back like he was in severe pain.

‚ÄúSteve, you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù His voice sounded strange, robotic. ‚ÄúWhat were you asking me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just weird that I‚Äôve been coming to your shop for four months. Every time I order you forget my name. I have to remind you each time. I just wanted to know‚Ä¶are you trolling me? Did I piss you off in high school and now you‚Äôre getting back at me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Steve said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that at all. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù

He started hitting his chest, like he was having a panic attack.

‚ÄúSteve, relax. I didn‚Äôt mean to freak you out‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYour name is Harry. Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry.‚Äù

‚ÄúSteve! Chill!‚Äù

‚ÄúYournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.‚Äù

I grabbed Steve‚Äôs arm, trying to calm him.

But he tore free, started running in a circle.

I was so creeped out. I backed away. My voice soft and measured.

‚ÄúLook, Steve. I‚Äôm sorry I stressed you out. Let‚Äôs forget we had this conversation.‚Äù

I disappeared around the corner. I could still hear him repeating:

‚ÄúYournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.‚Äù

***

That night, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted. Flopped down on the couch. Opened my computer to catch up on work.

All I could think about was Steve‚Äôs reaction. What the hell was wrong with him?

After finishing my work, I showered, got ready for bed, and turned on the TV to stream a movie. God knows how long I watched it before falling asleep.

Sometime later, I jerked awake to the sound of movement in the kitchen.

PFT-PFT-PFT. It resembled footsteps, shifting along the tile of my dining room.

PFT-PFT-PFT. I glanced at the ceiling. Was it my upstairs neighbor? No.

I glanced at the clock: 2:30 am.¬†¬†

PFT-PFT-PFT. The hell?

I grabbed the golf club near my bed, ventured to my doorway, sweating.

The strange movements accelerated.

I wondered if it was a rat, searching for food.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHello? Anyone in here?‚Äù

I flipped on my kitchen light in the hall.¬†¬†

CLICK. The entire kitchen and dining area lit up.

I searched every corner of the apartment. Opened each drawer and cabinet, wondering: what was that? A mouse? A bat?

I didn‚Äôt find anything, so I shut off the lights. Went back to bed. But this time‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶I placed the golf club a little closer to my nightstand‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and plugged in a nightlight for good measure‚Ä¶

It was a few hours later when I awoke to more sounds in my bedroom.¬†¬†

PFT-PFT-PFT. PFT-PFT-PFT.

I opened my eyes. A humanoid shape stood at the end of my bed. Breathing heavily.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I gasped, my voice tight with fear. Then ‚Äî

CREAK. The shape lowered itself onto the bed.

I reached for my club. But a firm hand gripped my wrist.

Another slapped down over my mouth, silencing me.

There was just enough glow from my nightlight to make out the intruder‚Äôs face ‚Äî¬†¬†

But yeah I would be lying if I said that I still don‚Äôt enjoy that diner style coffee‚Ä¶but with much much better beans than your typical diner lol.

1kwmgea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kwmgea/aita_for_not_putting_up_with_my_mil/,AITA for not putting up with my MIL,"AITA? My MIL (65) has been a total pain forever. My fianc√© has two kids with an ex. His mother has been trying to rip through boundaries since their first was born. She has been an addict and an alcoholic forever. (Zero judgment, both my parents are alcoholics.) She previously tried attacking me (meth is fun) so I'm wary of her. Especially now.



I was dumb and allowed her to move in when she became 7 or so years sober. My fianc√© was *so* happy, she was happy, kids were happy, she seemed great to me.


She's been here little over a year. Has a part time job. My knives began disappearing. I asked her if she had some (she lives in the basement, we live on the second story) and she said no. Asked her several times. No. Eventually, half my knives were gone. At this point I was beyond pissed. My first potential AH move- I went into her room and found 1/3 of our utensils and 3 out of 4 of my missings knives. I confronted my fianc√© and told him this needs to stop. I started hiding my knives because he wouldn't talk to her. He said he'd replace the knife and talk to her. So a month later, he talks to her after she got diagnosed with CHF, diabetes, and acute liver injury. She refused to listen to me since August to get looked at because she's always out of breath, blah blah I'm dumb for caring. She gets a colonscopy. She has colon cancer. So now anything she does is fine because she's sick. Good timing. Said she's sorry to him. Cool.


I don't do well with confrontation and bs in my own house. Especially when my things start disappearing. ""She forgot"" is not good enough. She had a coffee tin full of utensils. She started this shit where I've noticed in January. I've had shit stolen before, I don't need it.


Hilariously, I'm pregnant. He keeps reminding me that happy pregnancies make happy babies. I'm down for that. I'm on edge at 5 months pregnant. I don't want to see her or talk to her. Any time we interact if I disagree I'm supposed to ""let it go"". Cool. Tell your mom to leave me alone. ""She's sick and you need to be the bigger person"". I literally don't want to be in the house when she is. I've never been pregnant. This is all 100% new to me. (No one knows either, besides my fianc√© and my best friend) My ability to regulate struggling severely (why I'm making the post).


Last night for memorial day, his ex and her bf came over for a BBQ. Kids playing. Great. Everyone is having a good time. His mom comes up, I'm cordial and she's cordial. She decides to ask if I got a picture she sent me. I said no. She then asks if I saw it because Google photos made a collage. I said no, my phone has been on the fritz and I don't really have the energy to try and fuck with it. (OH, lol, my dad died a little over a week ago). She goes silent so I carry on. I'm talking to my fianc√©'s ex, laughing over someone calling my black tri Australian shepherd a ""Burmese mountain dog"". His mom decides to correct me and say they're called ""baronese"". Bernese. ""No, my friend had one, so I would know"". So I took a breath and went inside because *dude could you not*. This is dumb, whatever, I'll take a breath. His ex googles it and sure enough, they're called Bernese. Dumb, right? Why inject yourself to argue?



So when I ask my fianc√© wtf, he gets irritated at me and says ""she has cancer, you need to just let it go"". I don't understand why it's me that has to change when she won't leave me alone. She gets argumentative immediately. Refuses to do bare minimum care for her health problems and cries to him. I stopped interacting (I was in health care) because she just doesn't listen and does what she wants despite the doctors and her son begging her to stop.


This started with silverware and now I'm just over it. She treats me like this isn't *my* house. Last night I wasn't able to find our huge, unopened jar of benadryl that has never moved from the cabinet. He says ""it's gotta be around somewhere"". I'm terrified that once this baby is born that I'm gonna have to hide in our room because she has zero boundaries. I am *flipping the fuck out*. Every possible scenario is screeching through my head. I don't understand. Is it because she's finally comfortable? Is she just this dense? Is it because I don't try and help her so she argue with whatever I say?

Help me see reasoning here üò≠,"I‚Äôve been seeing this guy on and off for a year now, we‚Äôre 2 years apart in our late twenties, we stopped talking again in March and it was no surprise to me since he had already done this before, that during this break in March he started hanging out with his ex-girlfriend. They have been broken up for two years now, and they had dated about five years. She already had a child from a failed marriage and was about 10 years older than him- they did also have 2 miscarriages
He reached out to me last week on Thursday. We talked about a few of the things that have been a conflict in us establishing a relationship. We also address some big topic like children, marriage, housing, meeting, families, etc. 
Sunday, we had a proper date, he got flowers, dinner and drinks, and we talked more about details for what we want in the future and if they aligned. 
It is also worth mentioning that he just finished a probation program due to a DWI and substance abuse (cocaine)- all due to the messy history with his ex and his bad choices. 
Monday, everything was good. He had officially asked me to be his girlfriend the night before and everything was great. I offered to get him dinner after his shift ended in the evening. He agreed and thanked me,  we decided to meet for a coffee as a small date in which I would give him his dinner and we would have coffee and hang out. I got there first to the location and waited a few minutes for him while he drove from work.
I see him pull up to the agreed-upon coffee shop, but I also see another car pull up a bit aggressively by his. As soon as he pulled in to the parking lot, he pulled out and so did the other aggressive vehicle. I found it a bit odd and got a strange feeling I decided to text him and ask if everything was OK? 
He called me about two minutes after my text message. I saw this aggressive vehicle pull up again to the front of the coffee shop. I answered his phone call and he immediately warned me that his ex-girlfriend had just arrived to the coffee shop and wanted to have a word with me. 
I was not sure what to think but knew I did not want to cause a commotion. The Ex came up to me and started telling me as many negative things about this man I had given a chance to. She also mentioned how he had been intimate with me and her during any break he took from either one of us.
I asked her to step outside with me and I would listen to her. She was rational and agree but she did hold a rabid look to her as she frantically explained everything on how this man was a cheating good for nothing. 

She did also slap him as he arrived. They started to argue, her on his communication- lying to her, telling her I love you, wanting to put a baby in her, etc. And him on how she always wants to ruin any good thing he tries to build when he tells her it‚Äôs over between them. 
At one point I felt like an NPC as both him and her argued over past issues from their relationship. She did show me videos of him with her on Mother‚Äôs Day and other days in which they took pictures together.this is during the two months we were not together March- early May. 
I was very bored and annoyed at this point, it was somewhat comical, and felt like a dream. I have never been exposed to a toxic ex-girlfriend or a toxic relationship like this in my life. I did not feel the need to stay and listen to something I thought I had no part in. 
I drove off and called him asking for his side of the situation that had just occurred. He agreed to meet me at another public location. He called a few minutes later that he had just had a screaming match with his ex-girlfriend that followed him to this new location and blocked his car in to the parking spot he was in. He did punch at her window, which is not right, and she had also put hands on him getting a punch to his face. 
I still wanted an explanation to everything. I told him I would just go to his family‚Äòs house where he lives and have a conversation with him there.
He came clean- forced at this point- and stated that he had seen his ex-girlfriend from March through May before attempting to speak with me again. He did also show me the text messages in which he communicated with her early in the week that he no longer felt love for her and that he was moving on. The thread included messages where she is frantically telling him to stay and gaslighting him as if he did not care for her. He stated it was bad habits- going back to her- and feeling bad as they had history together, making it hard to not respond when she reached out. 
At this point, I was not sure what to think as she did come blasting her horn while we were talking about all of this inside the house. She also came up to his window and smacked at it a few times. I thought it was going to break with the force

TLDR; took a break, started dating again, ex-girlfriend reveals information on the guy dating both me and her, shows incriminating photos, Guy shows text messages where ex looks crazy, ex shows up to house in a violent craze.

I do like this man, but receiving this attack from another woman that believes her past is not a closed chapter and the revelation itself of some of his dating habit (me and then her/ vise-versa) has me confused on where I stand and what I should do‚Ä¶What should I do?

Well, I'm Not One of Them.","Do you know these type of people who always say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for a relationship right now,‚Äù but deep inside they‚Äôre hoping the right person shows up and flips their world upside down? Well, I‚Äôm not one of them. And this is not just another dating app situation. It‚Äôs much more profound than that.

Falling in love usually means an upgrade, and to be honest, I never really backed off from love before.. not fully, anyway. But lately, I‚Äôve been thinking that maybe being single,¬†*really*¬†single, might actually be an upgrade in ways we don‚Äôt talk about. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself to sleep at night.

So here‚Äôs the raw truth and the story behind why I claim I‚Äôm done with love. and why I absolutely, 100% am not.

Alright. So let me tell you what really happened, what I‚Äôve learned, and where my heart is heading. Buckle up...

To start off, I‚Äôm a ‚Äúromantic by accident.‚Äù I never meant to be. I don‚Äôt write poetry under candlelight or cry over love songs. I‚Äôve never curated a Pinterest board titled¬†*Wedding Moodboard 2030*. I‚Äôm not that person. I don‚Äôt scroll through reels of couples hiking in the Alps or sipping coffee in matching pajamas. I‚Äôm the person who skips wedding scenes in movies because they‚Äôre all the same anyway.

But here‚Äôs the contradiction: I love¬†*love*. I love the idea of being known. Of someone texting ‚Äúhome?‚Äù when I‚Äôve been out too long. Of having a plus one not just to events, but to life. Of fighting over which show to binge next, then not watching anything and just talking instead. Of not needing to explain why I‚Äôm quiet today, because they already know.

So why am I out here pretending I‚Äôm fine being solo?!!

Let me explain...

See, I‚Äôve been through some mess. I‚Äôve swiped, matched, unmatched. Gone on coffee dates that felt like job interviews. Laughed at jokes I didn‚Äôt find funny and told stories I‚Äôve told too many times. And the cycle goes on. Hope. Vibes. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hang again.‚Äù Ghost. Fade. Rinse. Repeat.

And then there‚Äôs the introspection phase. You know, when you start believing the algorithm is broken or maybe¬†*you*¬†are. So you go celibate from apps. You delete Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, even LinkedIn just in case your ex shows up in the ‚Äúpeople you may know.‚Äù You tell your friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on myself now,‚Äù which is code for ‚ÄúI need to stop handing my heart to strangers who don‚Äôt know what to do with it.‚Äù

And just like people switch to dumb phones to escape the chaos of always being connected, I tried switching to ‚Äúdumb love.‚Äù You know, simple, no-expectation kind of love. Something with no labels, no pressure, no meet-the-parents energy. Just vibes.

I thought I could downscale. Date casually. Keep it light. But here‚Äôs the problem: I don‚Äôt do light. I do eye contact that says, ‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù I do overthinking and playlist sharing and ‚ÄúDo you believe in soulmates?‚Äù on the second date. I‚Äôm not built for shallow waters. I cannonball into the deep end.

So I tried to dumb it down ‚Äî emotionally. I stopped texting first. I stopped asking deep questions. I ghosted the butterflies and started dating out of boredom, not curiosity. It worked‚Ä¶ until it didn‚Äôt.

Because even when I try to treat love like a simple burner phone ‚Äî something that‚Äôs just¬†*there*, basic, reliable, no drama ‚Äî I still crave the intimacy of the real deal. The connection that makes you forget to check your phone, not need it.

And just like I couldn‚Äôt fully commit to switching to a dumb phone, I couldn‚Äôt commit to giving up on love either. I‚Äôd ‚Äúdelete‚Äù love for a bit, then redownload it when I felt lonely. I‚Äôd put up walls, then peek over them every time someone said something kind. It‚Äôs a cycle. It‚Äôs human. It‚Äôs exhausting.

So what now?!!!

I‚Äôm still looking. Not actively. Not desperately. But curiously. I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù love. I want an honest one. One with laughter and awkward silences and ugly crying and lazy Sundays. I want love that feels like your favorite hoodie ‚Äî warm, familiar, a little worn out, but impossible to throw away.

I‚Äôm not waiting for a fairy tale. I‚Äôm waiting for something¬†*real*¬†‚Äî maybe even a little broken, as long as we fix it together.

So, what‚Äôs your story? Have you found your person? Or are you still swiping like I am, hoping for something more than just another screen-to-screen connection?

Let‚Äôs talk. Maybe love isn't dead after all. Maybe it's just lost‚Ä¶ like me‚Ä¶ looking for directions without Google Maps.",8,1748349642.0,infp,0,1.0,False

Sao Miguel's main appeal is definitely hiking. The island boasts some truly beautiful treks and natural viewpoints. The towns themselves, however, don't offer much; you'll be done with Ponta Delgada in about a day. If hiking isn't your thing, I'd honestly advise against the Azores entirely, as there are better destinations for a relaxed vacation.
You're also heavily dependent on the weather. We were fortunate to have a few sunny days, which made our trip pleasant. Otherwise, it would have been gloomy and boring. The fog was incredibly thick at times, limiting visibility to just a few meters at high viewpoints. Out of 14 days, we only had about three or four truly sunny ones. Weather changes quickly on the island, and it can vary significantly even 10km away. I'm glad we stayed for two weeks; it allowed us to catch those precious sunny days. While one week is generally enough to see the main sights, if you're unlucky with the weather, you might wish you'd saved your flight ticket.
For navigating the trails, I recommend the maps.me app. It's an offline map, so remember to download the Azores map. I found it to be very comprehensive, showing even small paths that weren't on Google Maps. Interestingly, there was one waterfall on Google Maps that wasn't on maps.me. I didn't bother with a local SIM card, as almost all restaurants offer Wi-Fi, and there's free Wi-Fi available in Ponta Delgada too.

# Essential Tip: Rent a Car from Day One!
Our biggest mistake was only renting a car five days into our trip. Buses are unpredictable and infrequent, leading to a significant loss of time. At around ‚Ç¨19/day, renting a car is too cheap and convenient to pass up. Just get it on day one! You can use Qeeq to compare prices. With a car, getting around is a breeze; you can reach the easternmost point of the island in about 1.5 hours. Don't hesitate to take detours for viewpoints along the way‚Äîwe stumbled upon many fantastic surprises that I can't even begin to list.

# Activities & Must-Sees
Here are some highlights from our trip:
 * Hiking around Lagoa Verde and Azul (Sete Cidades): Gorgeous viewpoints and trails.
 * Termas da Ferraria: This is the one thing you absolutely cannot miss. It was hands down the best experience of the entire trip. You get a mix of warm and cool water streams, creating a super cool ambiance. It's free, but be sure to go during low tide.
 * Termas das Caldeiras da Ribeira Grande: A fantastic hot spring experience. For ‚Ç¨6 per person, you get an hour in 40¬∞C waters. I loved it.
 * Lagoa do Fogo: Absolutely stunning, especially during golden hour.
 * Gruta do Carv√£o: We only managed the short tour as the long one was fully booked in May. Reserve in advance! It's a nice experience.
 * Parque Natural da Ribeira dos Caldeir√µes: Features multiple beautiful waterfalls.
 * Cha Gorreana: The hike around the tea plantation is lovely. The ""museum"" is very small and uninformative; it's clearly just a sales funnel. Stick to the hike.
 * Furnas: The walk around Furnas Lake is pleasant, and the Jardim P√∫blico, with its ground-level smoke, is interesting. The rest of the town doesn't have much to offer. We found Parque Terra Nostra disappointing for the ‚Ç¨17 price.
 * Lagoa do Congro: A cute trail, worth mentioning.
 * Nordeste: A nice road trip with beautiful viewpoints along the way, but the town itself was deserted.
 * Cascata da F√°brica da Vila + Praia √Ågua d'Alto: A good hike that includes an abandoned factory in the woods, plus a cool beach with a restaurant overlooking the sea.
 * OutroLado: A cool bar that sometimes has live music. We spent many nights there.

# Our Favorite Eats
 * Jardim Natural Food and Coffee: Their ‚Ç¨15 brunch is incredible‚Äîthree dishes plus a drink, almost too much for one person. Amazing value and a great ambiance.
 * Queijaria Furnense - Angus Meat (in Furnas): While I can't speak for other dishes, their cheese pizza was insane, with cheese even in the crust. Delicious and only ‚Ç¨10.
 * Forneria S√£o Dinis: Really good pizza and a great francesinha (a typical Portuguese dish with beer sauce).
 * A Tasca: Pretty good with a nice ambiance, but expect a super long queue.
 * Man√© Cigano: A local fish restaurant. My dad loved it, but I thought it was just ""meh.""

# Hostel Stays
This was an unforgettable trip, especially thanks to the incredible people we met staying in hostels. If you enjoy socializing, I highly recommend it (just remember your earplugs!). The cheapest options we found were generally in Ponta Delgada. We spent two nights in Ribeira Grande and the rest in Ponta Delgada.
 * Azores Dream Hostel: The best value we found in terms of quality. Just ‚Ç¨15/night for a private room with three beds!
 * Change the World Hostel: This is where we made our new friends. We shared meals with new people every night, creating really cool vibes. It's a bit far from the city center but close to the airport.
 * North Shore Hostel (Ribeira Grande): A pretty and modern place with hotel-standard rooms, but there was low social interaction and no cooking facilities.

1kwm5w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1kwm5w6/my_housemate_is_a_fat_lazy_sod/,My housemate is a fat lazy sod,"So, I‚Äôve been living with my housemate for 6 years. She‚Äôs always been on the lazy end of the scale with me completing the majority of the housework and me supplying the majority of the household goods. But she‚Äôs pretty quiet and always pays her rent and bills on time. 

My issue is, she‚Äôs gotten lazier and by default, I‚Äôm getting more and more tired. We have developed a good friendship over the years but I unfortunately am struggling to even like her anymore. 

To provide some context, she works part-time, and I work full time and study my masters part time all while possibly dying if my current treatment doesn‚Äôt work. 
On the four days of the week on which she doesn‚Äôt work, she lays in bed watching movies on her laptop. 
On the two days of the week on which I don‚Äôt work, I study, clean the house, do our laundry and meal prep.

Over the years, she‚Äôs transformed from someone who simply didn‚Äôt clean, to someone who made a mess on the counter and then said ‚Äúcan you wipe the counters‚Äù, someone who would call from the couch ‚ÄúOh! Take the bin out! It‚Äôs full.‚Äù someone who would say ‚Äúthe sheets need to be washed.‚Äù to hint she wanted me to wash her sheets. 

To get her on track to contribute more to household goods, I told her I was no longer willing to share my tea, coffee, and spreads with her, I also spoke to her about doing up a board to show whose turn it was to buy things like toilet paper, and thankfully she agreed. We are how tracking at 60(me) and 40(her) Much better than the 85/15 ratio we had before in terms of supplied goods. Only downside is that she buys the cheap shitty brands (e.g., the super rough toilet paper or the laundry detergent that doesn‚Äôt do well in removing stains). 

More recently, I cracked it over the laundry. I had an op to get some damaged tissue removed and was at home taking some time off work to recover post procedure. I was running out of comfy clothes so I went down stairs and put 3 outfits in the wash. After hanging them out before getting back into bed, she came to my room to have a go at me for not doing her washing and only mine (she was home all day too and capable of doing hers herself). She didn‚Äôt let me respond and simply went about hiding in her room before inviting friends to the house periodically so she could come out and eat while they were there. Eventually, I tricked her into thinking I‚Äôd left the house so she‚Äôd come out of her room and I could speak to her. I let her know I didn‚Äôt appreciate being seen at the laundry maid and told her if her response to me not performing a task of labour on her behalf was to attack me, then she could do her laundry herself. 

I still wash all the towels we use and do the weekly household cleaning (toilet deep clean, vacuum every room except her bedroom, bathroom and kitchen basic wipe downs, and mop). But I no longer wash her clothes or sheets. As a result, she‚Äôs gone from having clean sheets every week to having clean sheets every month. 

I would like it if she took more off my plate but the problem is, when I protest by not completing housework, the house becomes a mess. I‚Äôll last 3 weeks until I can‚Äôt take it anymore and have to clean. And it‚Äôs making me resent her. I‚Äôm soo busy and I‚Äôm sooo sick, I don‚Äôt need to be dealing with such a lazy cow. 

It‚Äôs agonising too because it‚Äôs not like she leaves the house on her days off, she just lays in bed at home all day. But I also feel maybe she is depressed because she is gaining weight and orders uber eats twice a week, eating very few meals during the rest of the week. Mainly lollies and cereal. Am I expecting too much from her? 

Note: I am also severely depressed because of the fact that I am probably not going to live very long, but I know depression can impact people differently.


I‚Äôve been looking for other rental options/housemates recently. However, she mentioned travelling next year and not resigning her lease in december. My question is, do I still go ahead with my plans to ruin the friendship by leaving to live with someone else, or do I suck it up for a few months, and take over the house to myself when she leaves and let her think the friendship was fine? 
Only con is that she dyes her hair bright colours frequently and doesn‚Äôt clean it up after spilling so we have a number of hair dye stains on walls and floors, and I don‚Äôt want my bond to be impacted by that. However, I could potentially request a move out inspection from the landlord to ensure these damages are identified and she incurs the charge and not me. 


Also important to note: She does kinda act like I‚Äôm not sick. She often expresses confusion when I say ‚Äúi‚Äôm going into hospital for the next few weeks‚Äù, asking ‚Äúwhy? you‚Äôre fine. Your doctors are being dramatic‚Äù. She‚Äôs also shamed me for losing weight a few times telling me my weight loss isn‚Äôt good and I should put more effort into eating more (No shit it‚Äôs not good but it‚Äôs a bit out of my control. I‚Äôm on prescription weight gaining drugs and I drink sustagen daily, but my body is struggling to keep me alive so ya know - i‚Äôm doing the best I can).

1kwm4q8,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/jobs/career-advice/earn-58k-civil-servant-disappointing-people-think-lazy/,"‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hard to leave the civil service ‚Äì your skills are useless in the private sector‚Äô | This is part of a series called ‚ÄòThe secret life of‚Ä¶‚Äô, pulling back the curtain on professions you‚Äôve always wanted to know more about.","The secret life of a civil servant: making a big difference as a small cog in the machine

At first, I wanted to become a political journalist but by the end of my masters degree in politics, I had lost interest in becoming a journalist ‚Äì and I knew I did not want to be a politician.

I became quite cynical and disillusioned after doing some internships in Parliament in my home country ‚Äì I grew up overseas ‚Äì and watching how politicians operate when the cameras were not rolling. 

They thought about election cycles rather than long-term change, so policy questions boiled down to ‚Äúthis will help me get votes‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthis will help me change the country for the better‚Äù. 

I applied for my first civil service job through a graduate scheme. There were several rounds of interviews over the phone and then a day-long workshop with the shortlist of applicants. I was told over 500 people had applied for 10 jobs. I imagine it‚Äôs even more competitive now. 

Fortunately, I got the job and five years later, I moved to the UK and started working in Whitehall.

They appeared extremely ego-driven and a lot of them were unfaithful to their partners. You have to be a certain kind of person to want to be in that environment and I knew it wasn‚Äôt for me. 

By contrast, the civil servants I met generally seemed to want what was best for the people. They had no political or personal motivation for wanting certain policies. It seemed a more honest way to make a positive change than getting into politics. 

I head up a small team and I act as a conduit between the Government and a certain section of the British public, as well as charities, organisations and service providers who support them. 

I meet with a lot of people and get their views on what the Government is doing, how it is working and give feedback to a minister by preparing briefs and reports. 

I also go along with ministers to events. Sometimes, it‚Äôs similar to a scene in The Devil Wears Prada where I stand beside a minister and whisper who everyone is at the event to them to help the conversation go smoothly.

I also write speeches and field requests from other departments or members of the public who wish to meet with the minister. I have had good relationships with all the ministers I have worked with in the UK. That is not always the case. Back home, I worked with one deeply unpleasant minister who used to clip her toenails during meetings. 

Some politicians are very snappy and bossy behind closed doors. Occasionally the wrong person ends up as a minister and they have 50 or 60 nameless, faceless civil servants flitting around them who they can bully. It has not been my personal experience, but it is more common than we like to admit.

My job is very meetings-heavy. I am in about four hours of meetings a day. I work from home a lot of the time and you really do get Zoom fatigue.

The hours are nine to five and I have a good work-life balance. The legislation I work on ‚Äì although it does have a big impact on people ‚Äì is not life and death, so I am able to shut off at five and not think about work. 

I‚Äôm paid ¬£58,000 a year and I feel that is fair remuneration. There are a lot of perks to the role, too. The job is really flexible, we are able to work from home most of the time which is brilliant and the pension is really good as well.

There‚Äôs definitely a culture of trust for employees. We don‚Äôt have to do a timesheet. We don‚Äôt have to report when we are going to be at our desks every day. I trust my team to get the work done. They don‚Äôt need to tell me if they are going to the doctor, they can just go. I do get put off applying for other jobs when I think of moving into a more stringent culture.

There‚Äôs a lot of anger over the civil service work culture and certain elements of the press characterise us as lazy, overpaid officials working from home on Peloton bikes. It‚Äôs disappointing because people forget that teachers and doctors are civil servants, too. 

I‚Äôd say that the majority of the people who went into the civil service did so because they want to make a difference and work for something bigger than themselves ‚Äì particularly the people high up.

Considering the kind of work they do and the number of people they manage, they would get paid significantly more in the private sector. But they stay as civil servants because they want to do well by people. 

Keeping the country running requires so much administration and work behind the scenes that people don‚Äôt acknowledge. The day-to-day running of the country is done quietly by civil servants.

Legislation gets passed all the time ‚Äì such as building regulations and introducing British Sign Language into schools ‚Äì that make life better and easier for many people in this country. All that is done by civil servants. 

Another benefit is job security ‚Äì especially in the current economic climate where so many of my friends have been laid off. The civil service doesn‚Äôt tend to make people redundant. If your job disappears, they will move you to a different role.

A lot of people stay in the civil service for life. It can be difficult to leave. The pace of the civil service and the kind of reports you write ‚Äì these skills would be completely useless in the private sector. 

Similarly, the private sector would expect a lot of skills that civil servants would not have. Delivering value for money and profit is completely outside of the scope of most civil servants, so moving to the private sector feels a bit intimidating.

I enjoy my work, but it‚Äôs really hard to feel as though what I‚Äôm doing is making an impact sometimes. In Whitehall, you really are a small cog in a massive machine and I am very much a middle manager.

You can feel as though you are completely replaceable. I could just not turn up for work and nothing would change. But I try to step back and remind myself that if all civil servants stopped doing their jobs then things would be very different. That helps me keep up morale ‚Äì even if I can‚Äôt see the specific impact from my work, my team together does make a difference. 

A hugely important aspect of being a civil servant is maintaining political neutrality. We are not employed to have party politics in mind. We are there to serve the Government and the people of the UK. And if the people have put a government in power, then we have to carry out what that government wants. 

In our team meetings, which are completely informal coffee catch-ups, we do not talk about politics or our personal views. I have no idea how anyone in my team voted in the recent election. When a new minister comes into a position, there‚Äôs never any upset or celebration.

The attitude is: ‚ÄúRight, we have a job to do, let‚Äôs do it.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs really admirable given the divisive political culture in the world right now.

The best part of my job is the people. My colleagues are lovely and knowledgeable. There‚Äôs a refreshing lack of competition. Obviously, there are personal ambitions, but you feel as though you are working as part of a team ‚Äì there‚Äôs a sense of camaraderie.

It is great to do work where you are making a difference for the better and not just boosting someone else‚Äôs profits. I think I would struggle with working for someone else‚Äôs gain in the private sector. 

The worst part of the job is the public perception of civil servants. I know that we are not liked. Some of my family look down on civil servants. 

I can understand why people see it as not a real job because it is so secure and slow-paced. People see us as pen-pushers who send emails all day. And it‚Äôs true ‚Äì a big part of my job is sending emails. But there‚Äôs more to it than that, and the fact that the public don‚Äôt agree can be demoralising.

Wedding weekend is over and thought I'd provide a budget breakdown.  It went beautifully and despite the fact that this is on the low end by BBB standards, it fit the couple's vibe perfectly and had lots of personal touches.  I'm MOG and we (MOG/FOG) paid for everything and managed all details so couple just needed to show up and party, which we did!  10/10!  

**Total:  $84,868 for 81 people**   
  
*Venue/ catering: ¬†$41,582*  
We had complete run of a historic building on the grounds of an arboretum in Chicago suburbs, so a deal compared to city. Flower garden for pics.  Ceremony outside overlooking a meadow, cocktail hour in an elegant old library with stained glass, dinner/dancing in a large room also overlooking meadow.  Upgraded apps (3 passed apps + 2 stations), choice of 3 entrees, upgraded desserts to a coffee/latte station and a full dessert bar.  Received tons of compliments on the food.  Note:  For personal reasons, we did not do a full bar, just champagne toast, wine/beer and custom mocktails.   
  
*Photography: ¬†$8,000*  
8 hours photog, 6 hours videog, engagement session included  
Fully get that it's a physical job; videog was professionally and unobtrusively dressed, but photog showed up in sloppy work clothes looking like a handyman, and once I have photos in hand, I'm going to give them that feedback.  This was a miss on my part not to inquire / ensure vendors were appropriately dressed.  
  
*Music/entertainment: ¬†$5,725*  
Violin/cello for ceremony and cocktail hour, fabulous DJ for reception, and photobooth with custom props we created / added in Chinese (bride is Chinese)  
  
*Florist:  $6,663*  
Bride/groom, 3 attendants each, 3 parents, 3 grandparents  
This seems like a small budget but we designed it so that they creatively re-used all the aisle flowers and chuppah flowers for reception.  Centerpieces were tall (did not obscure faces at table) and absolutely stunning.  I couldn't be more pleased and it felt very abundant, not skimpy at all!    
  
*Stationery:  $1,873*  
Used DearLucie Stationery (semi-custom); I'm picky about paper and she delivered.  Note, we did not do much day-of-signage beyond basic table numbers and a sign outlining the mocktails.  Elected to not do welcome sign, menus, custom cocktail napkins, etc.    
  
*Officiant:  $1,800 (donation to synagogue)*¬†  
  
*Flower Girl:  $200*   
Had given her a ""proposal basket"" with Taylor Swift theme which she loved, gave her a personalized welcome bag with treats, a book, etc. and at rehearsal dinner, we designed a customized placemat with games she could play with fun markers, etc.  This was a small investment that brought us considerable goodwill with this branch of the family and worth every penny.  Her family selected / paid for her dress and we didn't see it til showtime, but fully trusted their taste.   
  
*Miscellaneous Day Of:  $1,648*  
This includes favors (decorative boxes with candy incorporating both bride and groom cultural heritage), pashminas and fans (both came in handy), a big cheesy crossword puzzle for cocktail hour because sometimes you have to have a bit of cheesiness, guest book poster to sign, basket for ladies' room with toiletries, etc.  
  
*Gratuities:  $2,000*  
  
*Groom Clothing:  $1,500*    
*Bride Clothing:  $5,000* (dress plus alterations)  
Bride changed into a white slip dress for the first dance, which was a smart move as they had taken ballroom dance lessons and this enabled them to dance more smoothly  
*Hair/makeup:  $2,500*  
  
*Day-Of-Coordinator:  $1,200* ¬†  
A steal, as this was a friend-of-a-friend.  Brought 2 other people with her who handled details.  Worth every penny.  
  
*Night Before - Rehearsal Dinner: $3,200* (dinner for 31, private room at restaurant)  
*Night Before - Ice Cream Party:  $596.25* (included custom invitations that coordinated with main invitation, and personalized ice cream scoops as favors)  
  
*Day-After Brunch: $1,182 (*at groom's parents' home)  
  
*Welcome Bags:  $878.49* (custom stickers, hand sanitizers, treats specific to the couple, delivered to hotels the day before)

My ""home"" is basically whatever coffee shop has good Wi-Fi and allows me to stay for a good chunk of the day, nursing a single cup of coffee for hours.

The only reason I have internet access is because of these coffee shops. I spend pretty much every possible hour to¬† search for and apply to remote jobs. I feel like it‚Äôs my only way out of this situation.

I'm trying to be strategic. I have a decent laptop (thankfully, managed to keep it) and some skills. It‚Äôs my lifeline.

What I can offer**:**

* **Fluent English:** I'm completely fluent in English, both written and spoken. This means clear communication, and no language barrier for remote teams.
* **Diligence & Dedication:** Every opportunity is precious. I'm incredibly motivated, hardworking, and committed. I understand the importance of reliability and meeting deadlines.
* **Adaptability:** I'm used to making do with limited resources¬† and I can also work independently and I'm quick to learn new tools and processes.

**Besides the obvious¬† challenge I have (being homeless) I have 2 major challenges :**

1. My budget is essentially non-existent. I'm relying on the kindness of strangers and what little I can scrape together. This impacts my ability to get proper rest, food, and maintain personal hygiene, which are all vital for effective work.
2. ¬†While I'm grateful for the coffee shop, it's not a permanent solution. I need a way to secure more stable internet access and a reliable place to work.

I‚Äôm looking for anything:

* **Freelance gigs:** Short-term projects to get a bit of cash
* **Entry-level remote positions:** I'm willing to start from the bottom and prove my worth.

I am not looking for handouts, but a chance to work and earn my way out of this situation. I believe in my abilities and just need someone to take a chance on me.

Hello r/stopdrinking, 

&nbsp;
 
TL;DR I'm putting this at the top because I know this is long. At the end of March my wife was in the hospital for about a week and a half, but sent home and improving. In the middle of April she was back in the hospital for abdominal pain. A few days later she was in a coma. A few days after that she passed away. This was entirely avoidable, and I want anyone who reads this to understand what they could be doing to themselves. She was only 36 years old.

&nbsp;

I want to share with you a cautionary tale about how quickly things can go off the rails. This is for all of you, but my hope is that it resonates with people like myself - the ones who think there's still time, the ones who are always waiting for that one thing or moment when reality will hit you and you'll change what you're doing.

 &nbsp;

I've been lurking on this sub for years because I've wanted to quit myself. Day to day my responsibilities were handled without alcohol, but fun events that we were supposed to do together often got ruined by our drinking habits. We'd wake up too hungover to do what we'd planned, or we'd drink too much on a vacation to remember much of it or even worse, we'd have a drunken argument about something that didn't matter and it would ruin the moment. 

 &nbsp;

As for my wife, her drinking seriously accelerated when her youngest sibling died of suicide, a little over three years ago. On my own days off I would do chores around the house and errands that we needed to get done. Unknown to me was that on my wife's days off, she was drinking (not every day off, but at this point it was about every other day off). I remember when I'd get home from work and she was completely coherent and we would be a drink or two in when I'd wonder how she seemed to get drunk so fast. Maybe I was being blind, I don't know. I only figured out she was drinking on her days off when I started finding empty wine bottles stashed in places she thought I wouldn't find them. 

 &nbsp;

During these past few years she also was still handling certain responsibilities without fail. She handled our budgeting and paying our bills, did very well for herself at her profession, and on the days away from work that she wasn't day drunk she was handling things that needed to be handled. On that last point though, one day off from work that she would do what we needed was enough for me to forget the last three or four times that she didn't do anything except drink. That was probably a failure on my part, but our good times were always so great and we were really good at letting go of bad feelings and forgiving each other.

 &nbsp;

By 2024 it was just a revolving door of everything above. One day we were talking on the phone during my lunch break and we'd decided that we were going to have pizza for dinner (one of those frozen ones). I got home from work that night and could immediately smell something burning. When I got to the kitchen I saw the oven was on and when I opened it there was a burnt to a crisp pizza. I took it out and turned the oven off and then went upstairs to the bedroom, where she was passed out on the bed. I changed out of my work clothes and that was about the time she woke up, completely unaware of the pizza for a few moments until she smelled the burnt smell. 

 &nbsp;

That's just one story of so so many. I'd be so upset about things like this that I'd demand we stop drinking immediately and because she felt bad about whatever had happened she'd always agree, and it would last maybe two or three days before it was back to the usual. 

 &nbsp;

This is all a lot of lead up to what eventually happened, but I hope it can illustrate how probably a lot of us feel about drinking and alcoholism at a relatively young age. ""There's time to stop,"" ""I'm young enough to move on from this... eventually,"" and everything else we tell ourselves (me included, I'm no hypocrite.)

 &nbsp;

This year 2025, January 28th my wife woke up to get ready for work after I'd already left. It was the anniversary of the loss of her sibling, which she never really got over. She decided to take a shot before she left and that one shot unfortunately cost her the job that she loved so much. It threw us into a bit of a tailspin financially, but it wasn't enough for her to stop drinking and being home everyday increased the alcohol intake. 

 &nbsp;

During the next couple of months she applied to a lot of jobs but mostly wouldn't get out of bed for much else. I know what it's like to feel the devastation of losing what you think is your perfect job and that's what I thought was happening. What neither of us knew is that her body was breaking down. I could go much further into detail about that, but for now I won't simply because at the time, the signs weren't really clear when we didn't know what we were even supposed to notice.

 &nbsp;

At the end of March 2025, I took my wife to the ER. She was badly constipated and having abdominal pain. She was admitted and stayed in the hospital for 10 days. During that stay she was confused about a lot of things and not herself. At one point she called me at work to tell me about something she thought was going on at our home and got upset with me when I told her she was at the hospital and not home. She insisted she was home and I should believe her.

 &nbsp;

Her doctors explained to me that she was in the beginning stages of liver failure, but because of her age and because there was no scarring on her liver she would be fine... if she stopped drinking. When they told me that, in front of her, she was too incoherent to understand what they'd said. As the last doctor walked out of the room she said to me ""I didn't even hear what he said"" and laughed - and me, not knowing any better I chalked that up to pain meds.

 &nbsp;

By the end of her hospital stay, she was improving. She was no longer having delusions and she was feeling much better. I took her home from the hospital and the very first thing she did when she got home was start drinking again. I told her that the doctors said she needed to stop and her reply was ""they said I need to cut down."" Despite her continuing to drink she showed improvement for a few days. 

 &nbsp;

About mid-way through April things got significantly worse, physically speaking. On April 16th I demanded that if I got home from work the next day and there was no improvement I would be taking her back to the hospital. Stubborn as always, she said ""You know I won't go."" The next morning before I got up for work she asked me to take her to the ER because her abdominal pain was so severe. 

 &nbsp;

Here's where things go so quickly. It was about 9am when I brought her to the ER. I left the hospital at about 8pm. During those 11 hours she went from coherent to not so much, and again I thought it was just pain meds. On this day, when she still seemed in her right mind, one of the last things she said to me was ""I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you."" The situation didn't feel serious, to me it was more like fine, she'll get some treatment and be home in no time. So her apology at the time seemed unwarranted because I didn't think she had anything to be sorry for. Just another thing we'd navigate through and get past. 

 &nbsp;

I went to work the next morning because I didn't know... anything really. It all seemed so routine. After work when I went to see her she was able to identify me, and answer all the other questions they ask in a hospital to make sure you're mentally okay. The one exception is that she was having trouble answering her birthday and the current year. When the nurse asked her birthday she'd get through the month, day and then half of the year before trailing off. When the nurse would ask her birth year again she would laugh and say ""sorry, 2025."" This went on for a minute before she said her whole birthday. I went home that night again feeling like it was just painkillers doing what they do.

 &nbsp;

The next day I didn't have to work, so I went to see her pretty early. She was awake but absolutely out of it. This was the day that one of her ~~oncologists~~ gastoenterologists told me that her liver had failed and she had approximately three to six months to live in her current state. That if she stopped drinking and managed to live a full six months she could be a candidate for a liver transplant, and that her kidneys were only working at 30%. She wasn't able to hold her arms up and her fingers couldn't hold on to anything. She spilled coffee on herself, she spilled one of her liquid meds on herself and by this time the nurses were hand feeding her. 

 &nbsp;

The day after this I arrived back at the hospital just in time to see them wheeling her out of her room. I followed behind as they were taking her to the ICU, and once there they explained that she'd fallen into a coma and her life expectancy was less than a month. At times it appeared that she was looking at me but there was no verbal or physical response. 

 &nbsp;

It just got quickly worse. The next day her life expectancy was one to two weeks. The day after it was a week or less. A couple days later and she had passed away, on April 26th, just two days before our 12th wedding anniversary. She was only 36 years old.

 &nbsp;

Her death was due to acute liver failure. For those of you who are around our ages, her 36 and me 42, please understand that you don't know how much time you have left to fix this. Acute liver failure can happen seemingly overnight. 

 &nbsp;

One thing that will always bother me about all of this is something my wife said to me so many times: ""we can't just stop, I'm scared that we'll have a stroke or something if we just quit"" and in the end, it turns out my response to that was right: ""if this continues one of us will die anyway so why not try to just quit?""

 &nbsp;

I know something about that sounds wrong... in what way I cant identify at the moment.  Cliche? Easier said than done? I don't know. All I can tell you is that I've lost my best friend and the love of my life, and I truly feel like if she knew what the end of this was maybe something would be different now.
