If you're thinking about professional teeth whitening, you're not alone. We all want a bright, dazzling smile, but the range of options and info out there can be overwhelming. So, I‚Äôve put together a quick guide to help break down the essentials of professional teeth whitening‚Äîwhat it is, what you can expect, and some pros and cons.

1. What is Professional Teeth Whitening?

Professional teeth whitening is usually done by a dentist in-office using strong bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These treatments are much more powerful than at-home kits and can give you faster and longer-lasting results. Some common types include:

Laser Teeth Whitening: A laser is used to activate the bleaching gel, speeding up the process.

Bleaching Trays: Custom-made trays filled with bleaching gel. This is also an at-home option provided by dentists but with stronger agents than OTC products.


2. How Does It Work?

During the procedure, your dentist will first apply a protective shield to your gums to avoid irritation. Then, a high-concentration bleaching gel is applied to your teeth. In some cases, a special light or laser may be used to enhance the whitening effect. This process can take about 30-90 minutes, depending on the level of whitening you want.

3. Pros of Professional Whitening

Quick Results: You can see noticeable changes after just one session.

Customization: The treatment is tailored to your teeth's specific needs, ensuring even whitening.

Long-Lasting: Results can last up to a year or more with proper care.


4. Are There Any Downsides?

Cost: It‚Äôs definitely pricier than over-the-counter products. In-office treatments can range from $300 to $1,000, depending on the method and your location.

Sensitivity: Some people experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening, but this usually goes away after a few days.

Not Permanent: While it can last a long time, you‚Äôll need touch-ups eventually, especially if you love coffee, tea, or red wine (like me!).


5. Is It Safe?

Yes, when done by a professional, teeth whitening is considered safe. Your dentist will take precautions to minimize any discomfort or side effects. Just be sure to consult with them if you have existing dental work, as crowns or veneers won't whiten like natural teeth.

6. How to Maintain Results

After whitening, you‚Äôll want to avoid staining foods (think coffee, wine, and dark-colored berries) for at least 48 hours. Maintaining good oral hygiene, using a whitening toothpaste, and scheduling touch-up treatments when needed can also help extend the life of your new bright smile.

# My Crowd Control Secrets Beta Test Experience

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""This sounds too good to be true."" I thought the same thing until I got my hands on Crowd Control Secrets as a beta tester. Let me tell you, it's the real deal.

I started with a small group about urban gardening. Nothing fancy, just a few hundred members sharing tips on growing tomatoes in tiny apartments. Using the Crowd Control Secrets strategies, I grew that group to over 50,000 members in just three months.

At first, I was thrilled just to see the numbers climb. But then came the monetization phase. I landed my first sponsor ‚Äì a company selling compact hydroponic systems. They paid me $500 for a single post. I nearly fell out of my chair.

Fast forward six months, and I'm now running five groups with a combined membership of over 250,000. My monthly income from these groups? Let's just say I'm looking at beachfront property.

The best part? I'm doing this all from my phone while sipping coffee at my favorite caf√©. No office, no boss, just me and my Facebook groups.

1fxbj18,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fxbj18/grief_rent/,Grief Rent,"When I was 21 and in final year of my graduation (Engineering) I met a girl online through some social media app. She was 17 back then and was in school. I helped her sorting and applying in different University and finally managed to get her into a good private university. I did it all because I was free in those days and was preparing for placements. I was also in a LDR back then so never had any kind of infatuation towards her. We kept in touch and used to talk like once or twice in a month which was usually about her progress at university/discussing studies only.

I got placed in a company far away from our home town and I got busier so our conversations reduced to once in a couple of months. However two years down the line my relationship got sour and ended. Now at this point our conversations revived and we again started to speak regularly. Intially it was about studies only but later on families and relationships were also discussed. She was also seeing someone and had broken up with the guy right around that time so we both had free time. We got a bit into each other and one day I asked her to meet. I went to my hometown to meet family and in between we met. I was 24 and she was 20 back then. It was a great day. We really had fun. I almsot spent entire day giggling on her statements about her fav food/ stupid colleagues. The day went by like a jiffy and it was time to go back home. I felt bit sad at that moment. She kissed me goodbye on my cheek and that made my entire coming week. This was the first time I had been kissed by a girl (even when it was just on cheek) though I was in a 2 year long relationship (LDR) before.  Now our converaations were more intimate. However we never discussed our past/ex-es. After 6 months we again planned to meet but this time the visit was entirely for her. We stayed together for 2 days, had sex, lost into each other. Obviously it was my first time but I had no idea about her. This time when I got home, I got curious to know her past and one bad day, I pressed her hard to share her past. That day I got to know she was sexually abused as a kid by her neighbour. She was 14 and this person in neighbourhood who had just finished his graduation, used to teach her mathematics. One day when her parents were away, he raped her. She was not able to decipher the process and did not retaliate. He threatened her and continuosly abused her afterwards. He made her visit him in night when everyone was asleep, she used to unlock her terrace and jump towards his house where he waited for her on terrace and kept doing the act. This continued for 2 long years till her mother caught them on terrace one night. She was thrashed by her family and made responsible for this. She did not get any support at that time and she was convinced that it was her fault only.

I was shocked to know all this. I couldn't digest it for a while. I wondered how could she not let me know it beforehand. What if I had hurt her to when we were doing sex? What if it reminded her of that beast?

Only that time I could observed a few things about her. Like she completely denied oral sex. She wanted to do it in a particular position and did not want to experiment anything else. She was more intersted in cuddles and holding me tight to her body. Now it all made sense. She was still recovering maybe.

However, my purview towards her changed completely. Now I was more gentle towards her. Like I had to take utmost good care of this fragile being and she noticed it.

Suddenly her behaviour changed. She talked less and tried to avoid further meeting. I asked her for coffee dates but she kept ignoring me. However I kept trying but after 3-4 months, our conversations were one way only. She did not block me but never picked my calls or answered my texts.

There wasn't a single day when I didn't try during that time but since there was no response, I stopped. We had a common friend by now so I used to get her well being status through her. Few months down the line she had another boyfriend.

Now there was me, still stuck. Not over the fact she went through a trauma and coping with it in this weird way. All I wanted was to be with her. I even asked her to remain friends with me but she did not respond. 

Now I am 31, have had a couple of relationships in between and really good one but I am still not over her. I feel like I want her back in my life. I want to make her forget everything she has been through. I still cry at nights thinking of her. I don't know what to do about it. I know I need to get over and she can take care of her life but why do I want to be around her, I just don't get that. It's not that I'm sexually infatuated or anything. I really really had two beautiful women in between who were more than enough mentally, sexually, intellectually but I couldn't make it last longer due to my mental unavailability. I think I will always be like this now. Damn.",1,1728201609.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.99,False

The coffee spills over a weeks old blood spatter you wouldn't notice if you didn't look. ""You really think playing these little games is going to save you from state readjustment?! I've seen bigger and better men than you FOLD under the pressure of everything I'm capable of doing to get the name I want. I can warp your entire sense of reality! I can make you forget who you ever were!""

""Anything you could do to me,"" I snap back, ""she's already done to everything I love in one way or another. The one thing she couldn't take from me, you won't either, and it has no materialistic or informational value useful to you. You've seen my file. You know where I stand on that."" I pause. ""Do your worst. You ought to know how capable she is. You've examined my testimony. Your schools trained her.""

He squeezes a half fist around my cheeks, forcing my gaze upward. ""We'll see about that."" He gets up from the table, opening the only door out of the padded room I'm chained to the floor of. ""You've clearly been subjected psychological manipulation. We've brought in a professional to help you deal with it so we can get what we want and all go home."" A distant hallway light illuminates a female figure striding forward from the darkness. As the fluorescent lighting bounces off her curls and almond skin, my heart begins to pound like a cannon and blood rushes through every part of me. It takes me a second to register it but as reality begins to unfurl for me, I realize that the woman I'm sitting across from that's about to perform this psychoanalysis is the same name they're trying to pry from me. She's in their system. She's one of them now.

She briefy flips through my file. ""Mr. Egerton, you have been charged with high treason during the conflict that preceeded national reconciliation efforts and face execution for this crime. However, Given the nature of your testimony regarding previous ties to radical movements and the contents of your previous psychological evaluation, it is clear you may be incapable of standing trial and have become so influenced by a hostile asset to promote domestic terrorism that you have been coerced into becoming a danger to society we have fought to rebuild."" A small, smug grin, etches on her mouth, her bright red lipstick shining like a fresh coat of paint. ""The state has a vested interest in your case. There's much we could learn from your situation to prevent further efforts to destabilize our way of life on an individual level."" She quickly takes out a stylus and a tablet, her cold, shark-like gaze peering into my soul. I can feel my stomach begin to curdle as my arms go numb and my brow begins to soak in sweat. So many memories flooding back. So much strife. So much horror. 

""Very well. Where do we begin?""",1,1728201022.0,creativewriting,0,0.99,False

It seems like either things fizzle out or people lose interest, but I‚Äôm still hopeful that I‚Äôll find someone before the year ends. I‚Äôm looking for someone who matches my personality, vibe, and interests‚Äîsomeone to genuinely connect with.

Sex and intimacy aside, I really enjoy exploring new places to eat and trying different places to enjoy food. When the weather isn‚Äôt great, I like to stay in, play some games, read, or experiment in the kitchen. It would be great if we can enjoy those things.

I do enjoy intimacy, but I also find it fulfilling to express it in different ways, whether through thoughtful gestures, quality time, or simply being present.

  
Me:

* Single
* Not from the Big 4
* Can be talkative
* Average looking with, some say I have Japanese or Chinese features. You'll be the judge of that. But sometimes they say I'm cute. Tries to be expressive
* Average body but currently works out
* I love to cook and bake
* Gaming, TV and Film nerd. **(What's your favorite game, movie or series?)**

I posted here before when I was trying to flesh out my Mexico City itinerary (thanks everyone for your help and feedback!) but now the time has almost come for me to leave on my trip! Although I'm relatively comfortable traveling and exploring by myself, I do also like meeting new people, and if there are other solo travelers or locals whose dates align with mine, I would love to meet up, whether to explore neighborhoods/museums/markets together or just grab a coffee or food. For context, I am 31 F, a woman of color, from New York, USA. I've posted versions of this itinerary in more detail elsewhere, but here's a rough summary below:

Oct 17: Taking a very early morning flight, having late breakfast/early lunch in Roma, then spending the afternoon in Chapultepec Park

Oct 18: Exploring Centro Hist√≥rico and attending a Lucha Libre show. I haven't purchased tickets for the Lucha Libre show yet but¬†**for safety reasons I am particularly interested in finding someone to go with me to this, if possible!**

Oct 19: Exploring Coyoac√°n - I have tickets booked for the Frida Kahlo Museum in the morning, and then I'm planning to spend the rest of the day exploring various markets in the area and going to the Anahuacalli Museum a few hours before closing.

Oct 20: Centro Hist√≥rico part 2 - exploring all the free museums on this day, and potentially attending a show at the Palace of Fine Arts. Would love company for this as well! In the evening I'll explore some weekend bazaars in Roma.

Oct 21: Teotihuac√°n hot air balloon ride (booked) in the morning/afternoon, then hoping to explore some cute shops etc. in Roma whenever I get back and possibly also another neighborhood (thinking about Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera).

Oct 22: Xochimilco group tour booked in the morning, and then I'll determine my plans for the afternoon based on what I do/don't get done in the previous afternoons (for instance, if I need more time in Chapultupec Park or didn't have enough time to visit some of the museums I had planned for the previous days).

Oct 23: Exploring Roma/Condesa, and hopefully lunch at Expendio de Maiz (would love company for this as well!). My flight is in the evening on this day so ideally I would love to keep this day relatively flexible and maybe revisit any favorite spots.

Aside from the tours I have already booked, I would love company on any of these days. If you're interested, please reach out!

1fxba9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTherapist/comments/1fxba9i/is_it_my_therapists_fault/,Is it my therapist's fault?,"My husband's schedule is just simply crazy. He works literally all the time and gets only 2-3 hours of sleep. It's been like that for the past 2 months now as their entire team has been on summer vacations. We used to eat dinners together but now we literally spend no more than 10 min chatting because he needs to work. I was explaining this to my therapist the other day and she asked me how I feel about it. I said I feel ok because overall I don't need his presence all the time and I've been handling it well. I said I was just anxious about his health and was afraid that he could have a heart attack or something like that form all this workload and lack of sleep. She kept insisting that it's strange that I feel ok about it and as if I've been denying and suppressing my real feelings about my loneliness here. An important detail here is that I moved to my husband's country some months ago and basically don't know anyone here. We are newlyweds and are happily in love. She explained that me being anxious that he'd die means that I have suppressed my anger and as if imagining his death is my revenge for his absence. 
A day after the therapy ended something happened to me. Actually 3 things happened to me:
1) All of a sudden I got really mad at my husband, had a huge fight with him and even threatened to leave him if his work schedule doesn't change. It was strange that I was saying it because before the session I felt as if I was fine. I also felt as if I've been convinced that I wasn't ok with his schedule. We sorted that out with him though.
2) But another negative side effect is that I've been thinking about my ex from 4 years ago non-stop. He has been on my mind all these days. As my husband works, I make myself coffee, make myself comfortable and read old messages I exchanged with my ex years ago. It's like a ritual now. I've been doing it for 3 days now. We haven't been in touch in a while but I'm somehow desperately waiting for a message from him. This is really strange because I didn't miss my ex like that before and now I feel like I'm obsessed and can't stop thinking about him. I missed my ex a bit before but every time my therapist would say that I think about the ex to kind of escape from the reality I'm in. 
3) The third negative side effect is that I've been feeling very unstable for the past few days. My mood jumps from almost-depression to a strange euphoria, like every day I feel different. I've been having suicidal thoughts 2 days ago and today I've been feeling like the happiest person alive. It feels like I'm having a maniac episode, I'm full of energy, new ideas, and I can't sleep. I've never been diagnosed as bipolar or anything like that. I just took a treatment for depression 6-7 years ago and have been fine ever since. 
I don't know what's happening and it scares me. I have a feeling that my therapist convinced me that I'm not happy and I kind of absorbed that idea. I don't know what to do about it. I'm mad at my therapist. I will discuss it with her for sure, but I also want to get an external opinion just to understand if I was really unhappy or if she just made me believe so.

Mother and I had 30 minute separate readings, and things he said to us were extremely accurate, and he knew nothing about us or our lives. [we were told things that are valid past, present and future]

Long story short, he told mum that an older man that's very close to her in her life, in his 70's is going to pass away. That would be her father in law, my grandpa. 

This reading happened approx 2 months ago.. and yesterday my grandpa has been informed that he has cancer.

I hope I don't sound dumb but, how can it be that they can predict such things? I am just freaked out, I was freaked out on the day as well because some things were very spot on... but now this is just insane.

I dated a guy kahapon I met through dating app.

I know the guy, the guy knows me too. I was shocked actually nung nilike nya ako. I was new to the dating app (again after 2 years). Naisip ko, why not give it a try, so I swiped back. We know each other by face and name lang, but never kami nag ka interact before that.

So, ayun nag usap kami. Kamustahan and all. He initially invited me for a coffee, then naging inom. Then it went to something like coming over to my place but hindi pwede kasi I'm sharing it with a friend. May mga hirit sya na sexually suggesive, ini-entertain ko naman (yes, I know, I had this coming).

Naging usapan was to meet but walang exact plans where we will go but at the back of my mind, alam ko may mangyayari. 

Nag meet kami, he bought drinks, we checked in. Nagkwentuhan until sa may nangyari.

But we were cut shortly kasi may family emergency, and I heard it too. Kaya inencourage ko sya to go back muna sa fam nya to settle things.

On my end, everything was okay. I just asked him to drop me on his way kasi medyo out of the way if hahatid nya ako. After he dropped me off, he messaged me saying sorry and thank you and I replied naman saying I understand. Then wala na syang message ulit.

Now, I don't know what to feel or what to do. 

I actually signed up sa dating app hoping I would meet someone I could date, not just hook up. But feeling ko with what happened, I conveyed the wrong message.

I want to message him, kumustahin but di ko alam kung takot ba ako ma reject or pride thing kasi ako last message and he hasn't messaged me back for over a day. I don't want to sound desparate kasi üò≠ please help, tanggap ko rin naman if ever mali ko. I just can't decide what to do.",6,1728200333.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

I'm heading to Oaxaca and Mexico City next weekend (!!) - I've finally booked my tours and with those decisions made, I wanted some feedback on the rest of my itinerary for Oaxaca.

Arriving late night Sat, Oct 12

Sun, Oct 13: Take the colectivo to Tlacolula de Matamoros, spend a few hours there, then head to Yagul/Mitla and/or Teotitl√°n del Valle. If this doesn't take up the full day, I'll explore Oaxaca on foot a bit when I'm back in the city.

Questions: How early should I leave for Tlacolula de Matamoros/how early do the colectivos gather? Is it better to eat breakfast in Centro or wait til I get to Tlacolula? Is it worthwhile to go to Yagul or Mitla while I'm in Tlacolula? I also have some confusion on the difference between the prehistoric caves of Yagul and Mitla, the Yagul archaeological site, and the Mitla archaeological site, and their proximity to Tlacolula. Is it easy to get to Teotitl√°n del Valle from Tlacolula (or from Yagul/Mitla)? I am hoping to travel the whole day by colectivo instead of taxis if possible, which I've heard are more expensive. Finally, how much time (roughly) should I plan for these places? I opted out of doing a tour that covered all these locations as well as Hierve el Agua because I didn't think 40 minutes each was enough, but I'm not sure how much time I should actually plan for. (I just wanted to get a sense of this to know if realistically I'll have enough time leftover on that day to explore Centro - as you'll see, this itinerary only has one dedicated full day to Centro and I'm hoping I'll have time left after various day trips to spend more time exploring.)

Oct 14: Hierve el Agua group tour and guided hike in the morning, hoping to be back in Centro by roughly 2 pm and then explore Oaxaca on foot a bit more.

Oct 15: Full day in Oaxaca, wandering on foot and exploring markets and street art.

Oct 16: Monte Alb√°n in the morning, then more time wandering central Oaxaca. If I feel like I've spent enough time in Oaxaca at this point (depending on how the previous 3 days go), I may take a car or colectivo to San Mart√≠n Tilcajete or another village. My flight to Mexico City is very early the next morning.

As you can see, most of my questions are centered around my first day there, but I'm open to feedback on any of the other days as well! I'd also love to bring some coffee back for my parents, so would love any recommendations on that front.

Finally: if there are any fellow solo travelers whose travel dates align with mine (or locals!) and you might be interested in meeting up, please do reach out! Aside from the tours I've already booked (essentially just Hierve el Agua for the Oaxaca leg of the trip), I would love company on any of these days.

TLDT: I made a joke, my colleague insists I'm mad at her, wants me to respect her culture so i told her to respect mine too and our common ground was to be civil.

For the past few days I (23 f) have been having issues with one of the girls I work with, I'll call her Rose (27 f). Now, I work in a  small coffee shop and we are a total of 8, I am one of the 4 supervisors (Rose training), we usually all get along very well.

A few days ago I was telling Rose I felt bad that she had a rough time during her first solo close and that next time she could call me if she needed anything. She said that during my first solo close it had taken me even longer, I honestly don't think I did and I told her but she insisted that I took way longer and since there was no point going back and forth joking I said ""ok ok you're right I'm wrong haha, but seriously, please call me if you need anything so you don't go through the same as I did.""

After that we both went to work and I truly didn't see anything wrong with our interaction, I thought I noticed her being dry towards me afterwards but I didn't think too much of it. 20 min before her shift ends, she asks me in front of some customers and other coworkers if I am upset with her. I laughed and said no but she asked me again if I had any kind of problem with her, she seemed serious so I told her no, that there was no reason for me to be upset as nothing had happened. She continued to ask if I was upset and by this point I was getting defensive, I reminded her that I am a very blunt person and if I ever have an issue with anyone or anything I would say so, and this was one of those times, so I took her aside from everyone and asked her why she would think I had a problem, she said that when I told her she was right and I was wrong I looked upset. I said that I was literally laughing and that I was joking, I also made clear that if she thought I was criticizing her that was not the case at all and I was sorry, but she just wouldn't have it. This whole thing ended by her saying that I was indeed mad and that she had nothing else to say to me.

As soon as she left I informed my manager about what happened and she didn't really get why she was so upset or insistent on me being upset either but thought we could talk things out the next day, but that didn't happen. The next day Rose spent her entire shift ignoring me even when I was directly speaking to her, if she had questions she would literally call someone else even though it was just the two of us in the store. Three of the girls have been telling me that I need to understand her culture and that I should be more understanding as my boyfriend is Korean as well and that she has her own cultural ways of handling things.

2 days ago when we were closing I told her that even though she is upset with me we both need to be professional and to at least be civil with each other at work. I made clear that I wasn't mad at her because I had no reason to but she said that even though she was still very hurt by my actions that I was right and she would be civil even though she knows I was still mad. I asked why on earth she kept insisting that I have some sort of issue with her and she said it was because my face said otherwise, and that in Korea when women apparently have the face I had on it was because they were mad. I told her that I was not Korean and that just because I am serious while working doesn't mean I'm mad but she insisted that I needed to respect that she's from a different culture and that they think different, true, but I told her that she needed to respect mine as well and in my culture when we say we are not mad, we mean we are not mad, and the common ground was to just be civil.

Well, it appears Rose has told most of the girls that I am racist for telling her she needs to respect my culture and she has requested to change her availability as to not work the same shifts as me (it still hasn't been approved) .

I'm crying right now. Feel ko napaka OA ko. I'm 28F. 10 months na akong WFH. I left my previous company and choose WFH kase need ng anak ko ng focus, only child. But he has  high functional ADHD. Salary wise same lang. But the career advancement isn't. Super saya ko sa previous work ko not just because of the people I work with but also the things I learn. Almost 2 years kong tyinaga ang 2 hrs na byahe papasok ng work kase masaya ako. And I have some friends na mommies din. Ako pinaka bata sakanila and naging super close kami ng mga kawork ko to the point na pumupunta kami sa bdays ng mga anak namen. Until last month, nag coffee sila without me. They didn't invite me daw kase nakita nila My day ko and they assume na busy ako. I told them na nasaktan ako amd they apologize and said medyo malayo kase ako and biglaan lang. Naintindihan ko naman. I thought were okay. Last Tuesday one of my previous work friend told me na lalabas ng weekend and sumama ako. Itong nag ivite saken is kasama kong nag resign. She invited me but not the others. It's feels like I'll be crashing a party since the invite came from someone na nainvite lang din. I feel so stupid and desperate right now kase di ako nakasama. I feel like highschooler ulit ako trying hard to gain friends. I've been crying for an hour now. Feel ko napaka OA ko. Pero nasasaktan ako. Lakas maka highschool feels neto.

I think the Coffee in Las Canarias is some of the best I have ever had.

Specifically Ortega and Reina. I have ordered a batch of Cafe La Ladea directly from them but Ortega and Reina do not ship to England.

  
Can anyone ship me some Ortega and Reina? I'll pay all the costs + some extra for your help, or if you like I can send something from UK in exchange? - it shouldn't be too difficult as Ortega and Reina Coffee can be taken from any supermarket. Let me know and I can send you further details.

  
Despsues de tomar los cafes de Las Canarias, no quiero tomar cafe otro!

1fxb34m,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1fxb34m/the_distance_between_us/,The Distance Between Us,"I never thought I‚Äôd find myself in a long-distance relationship. But when I met Ethan (not real name), everything changed.

We met online in a random forum about music. He lived across the country, over 1,500 miles away, but that didn‚Äôt seem to matter as we spent hours talking about our favorite bands, books, and movies. What started as casual conversation quickly grew into something deeper. We were talking every day, texting, video calling, and sending each other random photos from our lives. It felt like we were getting to know each other better than most people who dated in person.

The first time Ethan suggested we meet, I was nervous but excited. We had talked for months, but seeing each other face-to-face was going to be a whole new level. When I got off the plane and saw him waiting for me at the airport, all those nerves melted away. He was exactly the person I had imagined, and in that moment, I knew the distance wouldn‚Äôt matter as much as I feared.

Our first weekend together was magical. We visited all his favorite spots in the city, grabbed coffee at a little caf√©, and stayed up late talking, just like we did online. When it was time to go back home, though, reality hit hard. As we stood at the airport saying goodbye, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how long we could keep this up.

Being apart was harder than I expected. Sure, we still talked every day, but it wasn‚Äôt the same as being together in person. There were nights when I missed him so much it physically hurt. Some days, I‚Äôd see couples walking down the street and feel a pang of jealousy because they had something I couldn‚Äôt, the ability to just reach out and hold the person they loved.

Despite the challenges, we made it work. We found a rhythm, planning our visits months in advance and making the most out of our time together. Sometimes it was just a weekend, other times I‚Äôd stay for a week, but each trip felt like a small piece of normalcy in our otherwise distant relationship.

We both knew long-distance wasn‚Äôt sustainable forever. We started talking about the future, about how one of us would eventually have to move. It wasn‚Äôt an easy conversation because it meant one of us would have to leave everything behind, but we both agreed that being together was worth it.

A year into our relationship, we made the decision. Ethan found a job in my city, and he moved to be with me. I still remember the day he arrived, no more airport goodbyes, no more countdowns to the next visit. It wasn‚Äôt easy to get to that point, and there were moments where the distance felt unbearable, but standing there with him, knowing he was there to stay, made it all worth it.

Looking back, the long-distance was a test of our commitment. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it taught us how to communicate, how to be patient, and most importantly, how to appreciate the time we had together. Now, every day feels like a reminder of how far we‚Äôve come and how distance, no matter how great, couldn‚Äôt break us apart.",3,1728199550.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

¬†¬†‚ÄúGot something to explain. What is it?‚Äù I was surprised. I told her everything. She was shocked too. ‚ÄúWait, he is a Playboy who break hearts.‚Äù Julia said looking at me with her eyes opened.¬†

¬†¬†I said, ‚ÄúYes. But I need to stop him. I can't let him win. And also Max didn't listen to me. She thinks that I am just jealous of her.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†Julia said, ‚ÄúDid you forget something?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? I found out his technique. And also he tries to disqualify everyone.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†Julia said, ‚ÄúChris filled the form for class president.‚Äù Oh! Right, I almost forget about him. I need to save him from it. I must help him to win this seat.

¬†¬†Julia said, ‚ÄúMaybe we should call Chris and tell him everything. We will help you on this.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúAlright, we will tell him.‚Äù I called Chris. He answered, ‚ÄúYes, what do you want now?‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†I said, ‚ÄúCan you please come at my apartment quickly. This is urgent.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhy? Is something wrong?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúNothing. I will let you know once you reach here.‚Äù He moved from his room towards my apartment.

¬†¬†Julia and I waited for sometime. The door bell rang. It was Chris. He asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened? Is something wrong?‚Äù We said, ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù I told him everything about Josh breaking hearts.¬†

¬†¬†He was shocked too. Julia said, ‚ÄúWe will save you from him. You just don't need to resign and fight with him. We will need to maintain your image good.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†Chris replied, ‚ÄúI can do that. I am not going to let him win.‚Äù It will be us who will stop Josh. This time Josh will lose. I will never let him break anyone‚Äôs heart. We started to make plans for showing that Chris can be a good president.¬†

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we tell you about this to others.‚Äù said Chris. ‚ÄúYeah, like they are gonna believe us.‚Äù Julia said, drinking her coffee. I said, ‚ÄúWe will need proof to show his real intention.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúBut how will we collect proofs? Do you have a plan?‚Äù Julia asked. I said sadly, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù It was almost 4 so I got changed and went back to my job. I was working overtime today.

¬†¬†¬†The sales were not so great. I have sold only five clothes in three hours. I was attracting customers when I saw Josh. He came towards me and said, ‚ÄúHi. So you work here now.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Josh looked towards the clothes and said, ‚ÄúDo you have something which I can gift others.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†I asked him, ‚ÄúTell me what you want.‚Äù He told me that he didn't know and I should suggest it to him. I asked him, ‚ÄúWho are you gifting this?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúIt's for my friend. Her birthday is coming.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†I took him towards the shirt section and showed him some shirts which were demanded more. He purchased a shirt and paid for it.¬†

¬†¬†He came back to me again. He asked me, ‚ÄúWhen will you be free?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúA still have an hour left.‚Äù He asked me, ‚ÄúThen will you go out with me and watch movies?‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†I didn't know what I should reply to. I didn't want to be near him anymore and now he is asking me out for movies. Is he trying to flirt with me? I answered, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†He asked, ‚ÄúAre you still angry at me?‚Äù I didn't answer it. He moved away. I wanted to stay away from him. I had a crush on a Playboy who breaks hearts. He walked towards me again with a lot of clothes.¬†

¬†¬†He said, ‚ÄúI need to buy these clothes.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt shocked because he can buy as much as he wants. I mean technically he‚Äôs rich.¬†

¬†¬†The owner of the shop saw that he purchased many clothes from me. He was happy as he thought that I sold many clothes. The owner walked towards us when Josh made the payment.

¬†¬†Josh said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's go to watch a movie.‚Äù The owner said, ‚ÄúYou can leave early as you sold many clothes.‚Äù I had no choice but to go with Josh. Because if I had not, it would be suspicious.

¬†¬†When we were walking on the streets, we saw an ice cream truck. He took me there and¬† bought ice cream for us. I was scared because he was spending time with me.¬†

¬†¬†I didn't want to be one of those girls who he will date. I didn't want to be heart-broken. Finally we watched the movie and then he dropped me at my apartment as it was late night.

Chapter 1,"**(GMs Note: I decided to share this ongoing pbp Fallout 2d20 game I'm playing with a buddy of mine. Unfortunately, due to scheduling and drive times, etc, we can only really play via a shared Google Document. We're both new the the mechanics Modipheus uses in their games, so there's a lot of growing pains and mistakes made while gaming. In addition to that, the awkward nature of the pbp game causes things to be misinterpreted, or misapplied. Sometimes rolls will happen without target numbers called and so on. So it's very much a seat of your pants kind of game, though we do try and ensure the rules are used correctly as often as possible. This game is set in an experimental vault testing companion animals. So every vault dweller has a cat, dog, or bird they bond to and live their entire lives with. Avery Graves is a young man in the Vault Guardians, the nominal police force of the sealed vault. His partner, Paw, is a large calico cat, specially bred like all the companion animals. She's about the size of a Savannah cat. The vault is located on the edge of Allen County, Indiana. I goofed when locating this vault. I knew it was very flat in northern Indiana due to the glacier crushing everything in the major ice age, so I searched for the highest landmark in Allen county and found it was in the same rough area of Chain'o'Lakes state park. So I just assumed there was a rare bulge of bedrock exposed in that area. When I finally compared the GPS locations, the highest point in Allen County turns out to be in the middle of a farmer's field. So we'll just have to play pretend. This game is still on-going. I'll be including pics and photoshops of stuff I made for visual aids as we go. Comments and questions are appreciated. )**



  


Avery: Spending the late hours the night before cleaning the hallways, cells, and common area wasn't how he wanted to start his week but needs demanded he pull a double shift on account of one of the rookies eating some bad Blamco Mac n Cheese. Once he completed his duties he thoroughly tended to his equipment.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†Later on after the shift meal, ironically Blamco Mac n Cheese, he slinked past the coiled mass of fur nestled on a heating pipe he lovingly called ‚ÄúPaw‚Äù, on account she had an extra thumb on both her front paws. Tiptoing by her so as to not disturb her slumber he fiddled with the locks on the cells and lockers out of boredom, knowing that he would be the only one within the cramped confines to witness the less than acceptable behavior, and be able to report it. As he was about to ready to leave Paw stretched and hopped onto his broad shoulders. Avery passed by his counterpart with a slight nod and eyes bloodshot from fatigue.

¬†¬†Awaking in his bunk, bleary eyed from the shortened sleep, he puts on a pot of coffee, pouring a modest amount of Blamco Kibble for Paw, before beginning stretching and exercising (**End+Ath= 1 Success**). (I can't find starting AP pool, so we're going to say you start with zero. So that one success is saved as an action point. Your action point total is now 1)

*As you're stepping out of the shower, brought to you by Abraxo‚Ñ¢, your PipBoy, resting on the sink beeps and the voice of an older man emits from the scratchy speaker.*

*‚ÄúGuardian Graves and Paw, please report to the Overseer‚Äôs office at the start of your shift.‚Äù*

*You cringe. When your father uses that voice and calls you ‚Äòguardian‚Äô you know this is purely official vault business and not a family get-together.*

‚Äî

A: With a heavy sigh of the still fatigued, he pours himself a cup of coffee that could wake the dead and turns around to see Paw in a miniature VaultTec suit, idly cleaning her forepaw. ‚ÄúHow are you such a early riser!?‚Äù Avery exclaimed over sipping a lava hot sip of brew. ‚ÄúGuess I'll get to it and see what's happening around the bend.‚Äù Quickly donning his gear and web-belt before topping off his VT stamped cup, he checks himself in the mirror and sighs before hitting the airlock cycle and heading towards the Overseer's office.

He swirles around the coffee some and takes another quick sip as the hallway comes into focus.

(Luck (now 7); ReRoll 1 of the same= 1 Success)

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶that's the stuff‚Äù he mutters in a soft grumble before being ushered further down the hallway by Paw rubbing his calf with her shoulder. ‚ÄúAlright, alright‚Ä¶I'm going‚Äù he says to Paw before shuffling down the hallway towards the Overseer's office.



‚Äî

*The lights in the hallways on the level are still in the ‚Äúdawn‚Äù settings, the scientists in the lower levels long ago realizing a changing light level helped the vault dwellers handle living underground.

*‚ÄúAvery, it's so nice to bump into you! How are you? I haven't seen you for a couple days now!‚Äù Her tiny calico sits at her heels and gives Paw a stern stare.*

Avery glances down at the calico before the hand and takes a slow sip ‚ÄúA bit rough on the sleep cycle, Ms. Hopper, the Overseer has us running doubles because a couple of the new guys are getting sick. Other than that though, business as usual.‚Äù Paw is sitting in perfect complacency next to Avery, not bothered by the calico. ‚ÄúI've got to get going though, we‚Äôll catch up soon - overseer business‚Äù he says with a genuine smile over the lip of the mug. (Cha+Speech= 2 successes)

*You can see a look of chagrin and disappointment cross her face, but she hides it well. ‚ÄúWell, you better get going. The last thing you want to do is upset the Overseer.‚Äù She looks down at her cat, drawing your eyes to glance down as her calico slowly raises a paw as though to bat at Paw, but Ms Hopper gives a strong Pssst! And grabs the cat's scruff and walks away, shooting you a look of apology. You continue on, reaching the elevators that haven't worked since before your father's childhood, and turn the corner to head up several stories, before walking out into another sector, the fake sun set and only lamps spaced along the halls causing pockets of shadows. You haven't been to the third shift sector in a while, but Vault-Tech ‚Ñ¢ is renowned for its uniformity so finding the Overseer's official office takes you no time and you only pass a few scattered people and their companions on the way. You enter to find your father, trim, 50s, with a bushy mustache you've tried to talk him out of countless times, his companion, Ranger, his dog sitting at attention, the Overseer, only a couple years older than you, his companion cat, a pure white long hair with blue eyes, Dove, and two people you haven't met before, both wearing lab coats. A tall, spindly woman about your father's age with a poodle at her heel, and a short, wide, man with a bird perched on his shoulder, the feathers a garish green and orange. Everyone in the room, including the companions, have a look of stress on their faces‚Ä¶all except the short scientists and his bird, who he slowly feeds Sugar Bombs‚Ñ¢ and mumbles to softy.*



‚Äî



Paw enters the room in perfect step with Avery and sits politely as the door cycles shut behind the two of them. She looks up at her companion as he scans the room with a slight look of perplextion as he sips slowly from his still steaming mug. ‚ÄúGood morning everyone, sorry to keep you all waiting. What can I do for you Overseer? Did I miss something in my duty logs last evening? Paw and I have been pulling double duty as requested, and I know I can get a little forgetful when I'm sleepy.‚Äù Avery smooths over with genuine warmth before looking down at Paw and scratching her head lightly.

With eyebrows raised Avery shakes the Overseer's hand in a firm grip while looking him in the eye. ‚ÄúI appreciate the high remarks from my pops, but may I ask what this is all about?‚Äù Avery inquires as Paw gives a little chirp of curiosity at the Overseer's words.



‚Äî



*With the feeling that you would do anything the Overseer asks of you short of murder or something else that would endanger the Vault, he releases your hand and motions it toward the tall woman wearing the lab coat, ‚ÄúI think I should let the professionals fill you in. This is Director, Doctor Abbott, from the scientific labs sector. Doctor, please take it away.‚Äù*

*You're shocked to meet one of the council's directors. The vault establishing a council of the different departments over a hundred years ago when they realized that someone needed to give full updates and help the Overseer manage the population of the Vault. They could even hold votes to decide on actions, but in the end The Overseer had final and absolute say.*

*Kind eyes below a head of wavy hair gone grey, looked at you. ‚ÄúMaybe you should sit down. This may take a minute or two to explain some context. Tell me, Avery, how much do you know of the origins and goal of this Vault?‚Äù*



‚Äî



Avery takes a seat after gently scooping Paw up in his free hand, placing her in his lap to curl up yet remain alert. He sips his coffee again before nodding to the scientist paying attention to him across the room ‚ÄúPleasure to meet you mam. To be specific and direct, I know that I've gotta keep the vault safe from troublemakers within, and make sure no one from without gets in. Outside of that, not much mam - I do my job as asked, when asked, and I take care of Paw. That's about the short and long of it.‚Äù

*With 4 successes born of years as a peace officer/vault guardian, you can tell from the condition of her hair and the tension in her face that she‚Äôs under a lot of pressure, and has been for a while. You see her keep shooting glances over to the short scientist and his bird, but keeps most of her attention on you.*

*With a heavy sigh, she begins,*

*‚ÄúOver 200 years ago, during tensions between America and China, Vault-Tech developed the radiation bomb proof vaults as a means of protecting innocent american civilians and important government bodies. This was spun off of an original plan for deep space exploration. Our vault, Vault 007, was intended to examine the effect of personal companion animals on the health and wellness of the vault dwellers. Unfortunately, when China launched on America, the majority of the proscribed vault members of 007 weren‚Äôt able to make it to the vault in time. The population was supposed to be potentially over 1,000 individuals plus their companion animals. Less than 200 made it into the vault. The scientists that were on hand and intended to solely be observers had to join the rest of the population to do their best. Tell me, are you familiar with what genes are?‚Äù she asks you. The short doctor playing with his bird snorts a laugh of amusement but doesn‚Äôt turn or say anything.*



‚Äî



(straight INT roll (as no science) = 0 Successes)



Avery furrows his brow, ignoring the bird man, trying to remember his schooling from years ago to no avail. He scratches behind Paw‚Äôs ears as she purrs contentedly before answering respectfully ‚ÄúCannot recall that part of schooling, Mam. Am I going to be quizzed on this further? Because this isn't really my area of expertise, mam‚Äù Avery finishes with a smile before a slow sip and a pan around the room.



(Per+Speech to read the room= 1 Success)



‚Äî



*(Your read of the room is just tension. The Overseer hides it well, but you can see he‚Äôs putting on a front, with a smile and nodding politely as Doctor Abbott basically lectures you on the history of the Vault. Your father is like a taut spring waiting for his chance to get to the point, often rolling his eyes behind Doctor Abbotts back as she prattles on. The unnamed doctor has a bit of smirk you can just catch the edges of on his face. He‚Äôs almost vibrating in his seat in excitement.)*¬†

	*Doctor Abbott closes and rubs her eyes for a moment before launching back into lecture mode. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try and keep it simple, then. Genes are the building blocks of all life. You, me, my cat Atom here, the plants we grow and the meat we eat. The problem our forefathers faced was a unintended narrow genetic pool to draw from. Thankfully, the biologists labs were set up with a gene decoupler/recoupler from Big MT. They were originally staffed and set up to try and extend the life of our companion animals. This may come as a shock, but cats in the wild only live for about 10 years, not the 6 or 7 decades you and Paw can expect‚Äù She‚Äôll say this as she lovingly places her hand on top of her cat‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúThe problem we have now is, our coupler/decoupler has finally failed. That‚Äôs why no new pregnancies have been approved in the last 6 months. We need to find a replacement, or the Vault will slowly die off or degenerate into an inbred mess of physical and mental deformities. Worst of all, we can‚Äôt ensure our companions will retain their extended lifespan to go through life with us. The experiment will fail.‚Äù With that, she looks over to the overseer, and then to the unnamed doctor.*¬†



‚Äî

With eyes like saucers and a stammer in his voice Avery fumbles out ‚ÄúWithout this machine the‚Ä¶future companions‚Ä¶ won't make it? Do we not have any backup pieces? Surely VaultTec gave us replacements for moments like this?‚Äù He looks down sadly at Paw who‚Äôs ear twitches in between a deep, almost snore-like purr. Looking back up at his father, then to the Overseer he politely asks ‚ÄúSir, what does this have to do with the Guardians of the vault?‚Äù Avery's voice trails off as his brain gears whir into various lines of thought as to what this could mean for Paw, him, and the rest of the vault. Taking another sip of the coffee sends him spiraling down a rabbit hole of thought, losing a slight measure of focus at this revelation.

This man understands what I've suffered!‚Äù He says, voice raised to cut off your father, finally looking away from his bird. ‚ÄúThe fools at Vault -tech‚Ñ¢ only installed 2 of the decouplers! Two!‚Äù He holds his hands up with two of his fingers extended and thrusts them at you, his bird flaps its wings rapidly and dances a bit on his shoulder. ‚ÄúOne of them failed years ago, and I warned the Overseer and Director then and there we needed to replace it. We need two of them. How else will I do my work?! How?! But nooooo, ‚Äòone is fine, Doctor Goldberg. You'll just have to find time when the machine isn't being used.‚Äô Bah! Commie talk. Share? In my genius!? Never! And now the remaining decoupler is finally kaput!‚Äù Here he places his hand to his chest. ‚ÄúIt would have failed months ago if it wasn't for all my hard work. That no one appreciates,‚Äù at this he glares around the room. ‚ÄúBut, I have saved us all! I dug into the requisition and shipping paperwork from those centuries ago.,‚Äù a grin splits his face, cocking his eye glasses, one lens from a horn rim pair and the other from a wireframe glued or somehow secured together. ‚ÄúWe'll‚Ä¶and I mean you, will just have to go get it.‚Äù At that, his bird shouts out ‚ÄúSugar Bombs! They'll blow you away! Get them now at every Super Duper Mart!‚Äù*¬†



‚Äî



Paw opens one eye to look at the squawking mass of feathers before chuffing, closing her eye, and continuing to purr. Avery slowly sips what's getting to be the last of his coffee while listening to Dr. Goldberg rant about things clearly above his pay grade. When the bird ceases its commercial for Sugar Bombs, Avery speaks measured and slow to no one in particular ‚ÄúEveryone is appreciative of your efforts Dr. Goldberg, I‚Äôm sure the future denizens of the vault will thank you tremendously. (Cha+Speech (to placate the clearly excitable scientist) = 4 critical successes) I'm following so far, but I'm still unsure how a Guardian plays into all this or how I can even help with this broken down gene machine.‚Äù Avery finishes his cup with a pronounced gulp.



‚Äî-



*Your father, finally losing his patience as everyone around him talks about nothing important, pulls Dr. Goldberg and shoves him gently back to his chair, sitting abruptly when his legs hit the edge of the cushion.*¬†

*‚ÄúWhat these¬† nattering goons are saying is we've got to go to the surface. Dr. Goldberg and the Overseer have found maps that show small a Vault-Tech‚Ñ¢ campus near the entrance of 007. According to their records, there's at least one, maybe even two more gene machines in secure storage up there, and we need them.‚Äù*¬†

*The Overseer, a little put out by the ‚ÄúGoons‚Äù comment, steps forward, placing a hand on your father's shoulder. ‚ÄúHe's right. I need you. The Vault needs you to go up to the surface with a small group to bring down this machine. You and your father will be acting as guards. It's doubtful anything survived after the nukes went off, but just in case, I'd like you to go.‚Äù His words fill you with warmth. ‚ÄòThe whole vault is counting on me?‚Äô you think. There's only one thing you can really do when the stakes are that high.*¬†



‚Äî-



Avery looks at the bottom of his empty VaultTec coffee cup, wishing he had more, before looking up then standing straight after gently letting Paw to the floor. He clears his throat and nods at his father and then looks at the Overseer ‚ÄúDuty calls.‚Äù Looking at his father ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna need to prepare a little for this, is there anything you think we should grab before we go?‚Äù Avery quickly looks over at Goldberg, ‚ÄúYou have any experience in self defense, sir?‚Äù

We saw each other multiple times a week, texted every day, and talked on Marco Polo. The group dynamic was this: me and Violet were best friends and Heather and Trisha were best friends but we were all close in our own way (names altered for anonymity). All of these girls were in my wedding, Violet being the maid of honor over my own younger sister even because my sister wasn‚Äôt over 21 and I didn‚Äôt think it would be fair that Violet would plan all of my events and didn‚Äôt get the title of MOH. I was extremely close to all of these girls but Violet had trouble sharing her feelings, over the years if we got into little arguments like all friends do or the vibe was off, I would always have to be the one to ask Violet what was wrong so we could talk it out- which we always did but it kind of left me feeling like I cared more about the friendship than Violet did. One day, Violet started acting weird and I could tell something was off but had no idea what, and we had just had a conversation the week before about how if we were ever upset with each other we would communicate better and let each other know right away but if the other person didn‚Äôt say anything, not to assume something was off. So even though she was clearly avoiding me in the group, I decided that if she cared about the friendship she would fight for it and I decided to let her come to me. We went to a birthday dinner for Heather and Violet sat across from me but didn‚Äôt talk to me the entire dinner even though it was just the four of us. Despite things being weird, I got covid and she dropped a care package off at my door so I thought that at least she still cared. Since I decided not to confront her about her behavior being off and let her come to me with her issue, it was eating me up and I was distraught that my best friend refused to tell me what I did to upset her and it honestly made me feel like she didn‚Äôt care about me if she didn‚Äôt want to tell me why I upset her or what was wrong especially since we just committed to each other we would. I was also very close with Heather at the time so I was confiding in Heather about the situation and how difficult it was for me. Heather was very understanding at first but then started to tell me that she felt like she was in the middle and it was uncomfortable for her. At that point I didn‚Äôt feel like I should do that to her and didn‚Äôt want to talk to her about the situation anymore since she was also close to Violet and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the group dynamic. I realized that I clearly put a lot of my self worth in my friendships with these girls. I made the somewhat rash decision to leave the group chat that we had with the message ‚Äúhey girls, I love you all so much but I‚Äôve been having a lot of anxiety and I think it would be best if I left the chat for now‚Äù. Heather texted me privately and said the normal stuff that she was there for me, as well as Trisha, and Violet said nothing. Idk why Violet was mad at me, all of our husbands are also friends and the only thing I could think of after months of reflection is that either her husband caught feelings for me or she caught feelings for my husband because she ultimately let the friendship die. She texted me after I left the group saying that she knew things were hard and that we needed to talk but that she wasn‚Äôt ready, I told her to take her time and let me know when she was ready‚Ä¶ she never texted me again. My best friend and the maid of honor in my wedding. Heather was getting married in six months, I was a bridesmaid and she kicked me out of her wedding and said she didn‚Äôt want to meet me for coffee to talk because she didn‚Äôt want to agree to anything she didn‚Äôt want. Trisha met me for coffee and told me I was a bad friend for abandoning her by leaving the group chat for two weeks and that she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to be friends with me anymore (spoiler- she didn‚Äôt want to be friends). I just don‚Äôt understand what I did to cause this big of a reaction in my friend group when all I did was leave the group chat‚Ä¶ AITAH?",5,1728199043.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

At my prior dentist I saw six months ago they only did x rays and no pictures at that clinic which is possibly why they didn‚Äôt see that I needed to redo some of my fillings ‚Äî at least that is what this new clinic told me.

I wanted to ask how long fillings can last and if there is anything I can do to increase their longevity? I brush and floss everyday, I have a very clean diet, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke or drink coffee. Is it just a thing of things not lasting versus me not doing enough?

Most of my fillings are probably around 20 years old. I had a lot of cavities as a child. My family was poor and uninsured so I didn‚Äôt see a dentist for the first 10 years of my life. ü•≤",1,1728198882.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

I've been reading several posts in here for now, but I see so many posts about using special water to brew coffee and all kinds of equipment for beginners that, to me personally, look way over the top.

1fxas1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1fxas1w/friend_visited_my_city_for_work_and_met_up_with/,Friend visited my city for work and met up with other friends but not me,"One of my friends who I‚Äôve known since high school had come to my city for a work conference which I found out about through Instagram story/Find My Friends location. I commented on her story where she had gotten dinner with a different non-mutual friend and asked if she wanted to grab coffee or do anything else while she was in town. She said she was here for work, so didn‚Äôt have time, but would love to see me in our hometown the next time I visited(she currently lives in our hometown). For context, I only visit a few times a year so its not like I‚Äôm there frequently. To be fair, she didn‚Äôt meet up with our mutual friend from high school who also lives in the area, so it seems like she was exclusively visiting old college friends/old coworkers (she also used to live here) rather than avoiding me specifically. 

However, I‚Äôm still somewhat upset because she easily could have invited me to one of the hangouts with her other friends if she didn‚Äôt have time to see me 1 on 1. I live in a major city, so quite frequently have friends who come here for work or a family trip and sometimes we‚Äôll plan something small while they happen to be here. I don‚Äôt always see these friends because sometimes they‚Äôre too busy for whatever they‚Äôre here for which is fine and they loop me in. However, for this situation, she came for a full week, stayed through the weekend, and met up with other friends multiple times. She very obviously could have picked at least 1 social event to ask me and our other high school friend to join in on and even after I expressed wanting to see her, she chose not to include me. She‚Äôs also very extroverted and has mixed friend groups before so its not like she has a small social battery or is shy about introducing friends. I don‚Äôt think our mutual high school friend cared that much about meeting up with her because unlike me, she visits our hometown like once a month and is also pretty introverted, so she would have said no to tagging along with a group she doesn‚Äôt know.

If you were me, would you just assume that her schedule is actually fully booked and its not personal or does it seem like she‚Äôs trying to distance herself from some of her older friendships? I also feel like I can‚Äôt say this concern to her without sounding dramatic or annoying, so probably better to just let this go?",1,1728198189.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

1fxaqib,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxaqib,Newest Bochet,"Just posting some tasting notes and pics of my most recent bochet, started on the 1st September. 

Cooked the honey SUPER dark. If anyone remembers my last post, it was like 8 or something hours on the stovetop.

OG was 1.128, FG 1.02 with an ABV of 14.2%. 
28L batch, approx 9.6kg honey, and used EC1118. 
I used Fermaid O, Fermaid K and DAP using TBEs protocol for SNA. 

I'll admit, I was shooting for a slightly higher ABV with the 1118, however it has finished exactly where I was going to backsweeten it to anyway and honestly I don't care that much. 

It smells like caramelised banana, with a hint of toffee. It tastes sweet, and when you first sip you're hit with a very dark honey taste, however NOT burnt! You get dark toffee notes, and maybe some dark roast coffee with a side of creme brule. On the exhale I find there is a pleasant dark cigar feel/aroma/taste. 

This bad boy is just over a month old, but it is smooth with hardly any alcohol burn although you can also sense that it's there.

1fxamg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fxamg0/aita_for_telling_my_colleague_she_needs_to/,AITA for telling my colleague she needs to respect my culture too?,"So, this will be a long post, sorry in advance. 

TLDT: I made a joke, my colleague insists I'm mad at her, wants me to respect her culture so i told her to respect mine too and our common ground was to be civil.

 For the past few days I (23 f) have been having issues with one of the girls I work with, I'll call her Rose (27 f). Now, I work in a  small coffee shop and we are a total of 8, I am one of the 4 supervisors (Rose training), we usually all get along very well.

A few days ago I was telling Rose I felt bad that she had a rough time during her first solo close and that next time she could call me if she needed anything. She said that during my first solo close it had taken me even longer, I honestly don't think I did and I told her but she insisted that I took way longer and since there was no point going back and forth joking I said ""ok ok you're right I'm wrong haha, but seriously, please call me if you need anything so you don't go through the same as I did.""

After that we both went to work and I truly didn't see anything wrong with our interaction, I thought I noticed her being dry towards me afterwards but I didn't think too much of it. 20 min before her shift ends, she asks me in front of some customers and other coworkers if I am upset with her. I laughed and said no but she asked me again if I had any kind of problem with her, she seemed serious so I told her no, that there was no reason for me to be upset as nothing had happened. She continued to ask if I was upset and by this point I was getting defensive, I reminded her that I am a very blunt person and if I ever have an issue with anyone or anything I would say so, and this was one of those times, so I took her aside from everyone and asked her why she would think I had a problem, she said that when I told her she was right and I was wrong I looked upset. I said that I was literally laughing and that I was joking, I also made clear that if she thought I was criticizing her that was not the case at all and I was sorry, but she just wouldn't have it. This whole thing ended by her saying that I was indeed mad and that she had nothing else to say to me.

As soon as she left I informed my manager about what happened and she didn't really get why she was so upset or insistent on me being upset either but thought we could talk things out the next day, but that didn't happen. The next day Rose spent her entire shift ignoring me even when I was directly speaking to her, if she had questions she would literally call someone else even though it was just the two of us in the store. Three of the girls have been telling me that I need to understand her culture and that I should be more understanding as my boyfriend is Korean as well and that she has her own cultural ways of handling things.

2 days ago when we were closing I told her that even though she is upset with me we both need to be professional and to at least be civil with each other at work. I made clear that I wasn't mad at her because I had no reason to but she said that even though she was still very hurt by my actions that I was right and she would be civil even though she knows I was still mad. I asked why on earth she kept insisting that I have some sort of issue with her and she said it was because my face said otherwise, and that in Korea when women apparently have the face I had on it was because they were mad. I told her that I was not Korean and that just because I am serious while working doesn't mean I'm mad but she insisted that I needed to respect that she's from a different culture and that they think different, true, but I told her that she needed to respect mine as well and in my culture when we say we are not mad, we mean we are not mad, and the common ground was to just be civil.

Well, it appears Rose has told most of the girls that I am racist for telling her she needs to respect my culture and she has requested to change her availability as to not work the same shifts as me (it still hasn't been approved) . In my opinion this was all blown way out of proportion over a stupid joke I made.",4,1728197535.0,AITAH,12,1.0,False

We get along really well, talk all the time, and have similar interests. We're not in an exclusive relationship, but I've had her over for a movie, and we've been on one little coffee date where we kissed.

I found out that she has been dating other guys, which again, is reasonable as we aren't in an exclusive relationship.

I let her know how I felt and she told me she was developing feelings for me, it just takes her a little longer. She was also honest with me, saying she's somewhat interested in another guy she went on a date with.

I told her that if she thought there was no shot of us being a thing, I was happy remaining just friends, but she can't give me a 100% 'no'. She's interested in both of us at the moment...

I'm trying to get a read on this situation. I know that if I'm into someone, I want them to be fully invested in me as well, but with everything being so fresh, and the two of us being single people just in the early stages of dating, I don't quite know what to make of it.

Is this worth pursuing?

I'm into her like crazy and I think we would be great together, but I don't want to be someone's backup. (Not that I necessarily  that's her intention.)

He's been great for my social anxiety and does fine with people outside and loves other dogs. He did great on the trail but there were two instances I was terrified would go wrong. The first was a guy who put out his hand to let him sniff. I saw Boru kinda giving it the side eye so warned him he's not great with adults. Boru let the guy pet him and the guy said he had ACDs and if he got bit it's his own fault. I thanked him as it helps with socialization and we continue our merry way. On our way out, we pass by a couple ladies and one of them turns back around and pets Boru's back with no warning, making him skitter a bit.

About a year ago, I started talking to this girl. We hit it off really well and pretty quick. Before long we were texting every single day. She's one of the few people I've met that I can spend all day talking to and we never seem to run out of things to talk about. I went back to visit friends last December, met up with her in person and had a great time, very natural and easy to be around her. We continued to get closer and closer and at this point watch Netflix together at least once a week and talk on the phone almost every single day. 

For most of the time I've known her, she was in a decade long relationship. Her boyfriend was not a good guy. Treated her very poorly, was manipulative, neglectful, I could go on and on. But maybe 5-6 months ago they broke up. 

I visited friends again in July and saw her. Actually, I saw her more than any of my other friends. The first full day I was in town, she took off work and we spent 17 hours together, driving all over town trying to fit as much as we possibly could into the day. We had only planned for that one day, but ended up seeing each other another 4-5 times. We would take any excuse we could come up with to hangout. I even introduced her to some other friends who were outside of the friend group we knew each other from. I went out for dinner with her and three of my closest friends (two of these people are a couple) and that's when things changed.

Before going any further, I really need to emphasize that for the majority of the time I've known her, friendship is the ONLY thing I was interested in. I cared about her deeply, but in a strictly platonic sense. I haven't dated in years and was very much of the mindset that I never wanted to again. 

Anyway, after she went home and I went back to my friend's place (the couple), they proceeded to tell me that they both think my friend is into me. That was the moment that planted the seed. At first I thought they were wrong. Why can't two adults just be friends? Why does it have to be something more? But the more I thought about it, the more I began to think that maybe I was wrong, maybe she was into me and maybe I was into her. Three months later and I can confirm that I do have feelings for her. 

Side note that will be important later, she ended up moving back to her hometown a month or two ago. 

That all brings me to today. We were texting, as we do almost every single day, when she suddenly said she needed to call me. She had gone out with some of her coworkers last night and one of them brought along a friend, they hit it off, exchanged Instagrams and today he asked her out. They're getting coffee on Thursday. 

I've been distraught all day, called some friends (another couple) to talk about it and they suggested I be honest with her. They think I should tell her how I really feel, that maybe she's telling me about this guy to see how I react, but I really don't think she would do that. We were talking last week and her ex came up and she told me about how he always used to say that if they broke up, she would end up dating one of her existing guy friends. She then went on to list all of her closest guy friends and how she could never date each one of them, but didn't list me by name. At the time I thought it was a good thing, now I think it's because the thought had never even crossed her mind.

Here's another wrench to throw in and the reason I am most hesitant to tell her how I feel: I've been in a similar situation before. Years ago I had a really close friend, nothing but friendship at first, slowly developed feelings after she and her partner split, waited till I couldn't keep my feelings a secret any longer, told her how I felt, absolutely torpedoed our friendship, she got back together with her ex, broke up again, fell in with the wrong crowd. This has haunted me for years. If I hadn't told her how I felt, I could have been there for her when she needed me, instead she ended up being around some really shitty people who just wanted to take advantage of her. Friendship wise we never recovered from that, but thankfully she's doing well now, which is all that really matters at the end of the day.

So here I am again, do I tell the truth and potentially ruin what we do have, or do I stomach the unrequited love until I get over it or we drift apart? I'm not going to ghost her or anything like that, but she is back home with all of her friends, has a new job and who knows, might start dating a new guy. I can't help but feel that telling her how I feel is selfish and will only bring me the momentary comfort of getting this off my chest. 

I was supposed to visit her this December, but now I'm unsure. Also, I don't see us talking less at this particular moment and it's painful being around her.

I got my power back 4 days after Helene and came back to Valdosta after 5 days. My house REEKS and it‚Äôs from the freezer/fridge area, no doubt due to the spoiled food. I‚Äôve read online ways to try and get the odor out (deep clean, baking soda, coffee grounds, etc) and have tried all of them but my house still smells awful. I‚Äôve also read online that the fridges made of plastic will ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù the odor if you will, it‚Äôs impossible to get out, and I just need a new fridge. Does anyone know what I should do here? Will my landlord replace my fridge? Or is it technically my fault for not throwing the food away before I left town the day before the hurricane and so I have to fix it? Any tricks to get rid of the smell?

Please no one make me feel bad or stupid. This is my first time dealing with a hurricane. I wasn‚Äôt prepared, didn‚Äôt stay in town, and didn‚Äôt think about food spoilage. ",1,1728195653.0,Valdosta,1,1.0,False

1fxa3t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecoflow_community/comments/1fxa3t7/converting_a_trailer_should_i_replace_the_12v/,"Converting a Trailer, should I replace the 12v system?","I‚Äôm building out a trailer for traveling with my girlfriend and dogs. We bought it with some things done, but unfortunately some of it I think needs completely redone. But my question is what would people do with an existing 12v system. It has one solar panel to basically tend it on the side, the 12v runs some interior lights and a car stereo plus a loading light. It also goes to an inverter but I don‚Äôt trust it much. Currently my Delta Max runs an extension out of the bottom of my car with my rooftop tent for 120v, and my glacier is plugged into 12v on the ecoflow. The ecoflow is in my vehicle as I have the alternator charger (and originally we planned on no trailer) So my thoughts are:

1. Keep the 12v system as it is plus a battery tender running off of a 120v plug. I keep most of the power generation in the SUV. Only annoyance is if I move everything off of the SUV then I‚Äôm running cables both ways and if it drives off the trailer has no power. I‚Äôll also have to get complicated with my smart generator.

2. Remove the 12v system entirely and put everything into the trailer. This simplifies and makes the most use out of solar across the board (less conversion loss) but I feel like I‚Äôm just wasting the original system entirely. I doubt I‚Äôd use the one solar panel, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get any money for the existing system. This buys me space and removes cabling though, I‚Äôll have more room under the front counter. Only thing is I would need to figure out some system for the alternator charger (maybe an Anderson extension? Luckily my battery is in my trunk so I still have tons of cable coiled up) and if I ever wanted to go SUV only for a day trip I‚Äôd be moving stuff over. 

3. Hybrid style. Would still need a system for the alternator charger, but I could retain the 12v system as is. Would I be better off keeping them separate? Topping one or the other off? Maybe the 12v should be tended as I suppose this could work well for things like another 12v fridge or for water pumps/heaters?

4. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE but I was thinking of just keeping the Max in my SUV for whatever I may need but get something like the new delta pro for the trailer? Would give me 240 and tons of overhead. At that point I could have a straight up panel.

Extra facts: I‚Äôd like to be able to run things without worry. We sometimes take e bikes, plus I bring my coffee maker, and we have the Wave 2. With the pups we also plan to bring a floor AC unit we have until we can swing a mini split. At a campsite we only need enough adapters for power usually but I‚Äôm worried that in the middle of the desert or something we‚Äôll be struggling.",1,1728195283.0,Ecoflow_community,0,1.0,False
