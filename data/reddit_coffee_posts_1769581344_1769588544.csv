 - written by my dumb self - Dumbo-jet.

So this happened. And then, I went to the bank with a heavy heart of depositing money to run my family life. 
Stood in the queue and started looking around, with funny interpretation of the brochures, department names, and then to my aghast every one in the bank started bowing their head onr after the other except myself and the cashier. He was busy counting the notes, getting intoxicated on the smell of the currency, raised his head with a nirvana kind of smile only to see the daring ot Dumbo-jet not bowing his head.
He however controlled his anger because, im a customer right, so he hatched a plan, intelligent fellow, politely asked me to open the SMS and made my head bow to the smart phone after the deposit was completed🙏.

Bank Heist- 
I further, I turned around bowing my head to the verity of things getting operated by brain's thought outsourced to 10 fingers.
Who am I? The only smart ass in the entire bank, I felt Insulted and immediately took revenge on him, Immediately went to ATM, stole the money I deposited without his knowledge and came out SILENTLY LAUGHING AT THEM.

Stupid people 🤣🤣

But over the past few workouts, I'm feeling less energetic. Workouts used to be super fun for me but for the past few days it has become somewhat of a chore. My strength in lifts like bench press, squats and other major movements are dropping and I can't lift the weights I used to. I also feel like I'm visibly losing muscle. I also feel dizzy sometimes during the day.

1qp5eat,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Application/comments/1qp5eat/i_stopped_summarizing_long_docs_i_use_the/,I stopped summarizing long docs. I use the “Semantic Zip” prompt to compress text into “AI-Dense” shorthand without loss of data.,"I realized that Summarizing can erase information. If I summarize a 50 page contract, I lose the fine print. But if I copy the entire thing, the AI “forgets” the beginning because of context constraints.

I used the fact that LLMs knew High-Density Logic better than fluffy English.

The ""Semantic Zip"" Protocol:

I ask the AI to write a new text because I want to put Information Entropy above Readability.

The Prompt:

Input: [Paste 10 Pages of Text]. 

Task: Perform a ""Lossless Semantic Compression."" 

Method: Rewrite this content: 

1. Dense Terminology: Replace ""The machine that makes coffee using pressure"" with ""Espresso_Machine"". 

2. Symbolic Logic: Use -> to account for causality, != to account for contrast, and  to account for grouping. 

3. Abstractions: Type a series of concepts as variables, e.g., Let X = The Q3 Marketing Strategy). 

What comes out: A thick block of “shorthand” looking like code that I can paste into another chat to re-store the context.


Why this wins:

It brings about “Infinite Memory.” The result is the alien code: Project_Alpha -> Delayed if (Vendor_X != Solvant). It reduces token usage by 70% and contains 100% of the logic.

1qp5d87,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1qp5d87/weird_thing_on_a_walk_today/,Weird thing on a walk today,"Such a random thing happened today. I was power walking to a coffee shop in my city to grab beans before they closed, and I still had a lot to do afterward. I have short legs, I was out of breath, and I was on the phone with my mom. I usually use my AirPods, but I’ve always been a little insecure about it because every once in a while someone acts like they’ve never seen a person on a call with headphones before and just stares at me. Because of that, I try to keep my voice lower or stop talking when people are nearby.

Anyway, I was telling my mom about my to do list and how stressed I felt. There was a guy walking quite a bit ahead of me who suddenly turned around pretty aggressively and looked straight at me. It was weird, but I figured maybe he was just one of those people who hears someone talking on the phone and MUST gawk.

I kept walking, and I don’t know if I suddenly sped up or if he slowed down a ton, but I started closing the distance between us by a lot. If I didn’t slow my pace when crossing the street I might have crashed into him. But since I was almost at my destination anyway, I slowed my pace. I would have tried to politely pass otherwise.

Then he moved off to the side, and I thought he was heading to his car. I actually felt relieved because I’d been uncomfortable by the awkwardness of it. But INSTEAD, he stopped, turned, and just stared at me as I walked past him. I could feel it. I didn’t fully look at him or acknowledge it because it was so uncomfortable.

At that point I got nervous that he might start following me, but thankfully I reached the coffee shop and went inside.

I don’t know if he overheard my conversation and thought I was being rude or impatient, or if he thought I was trying to aggressively get past him (I wasn’t intentionally), or something else entirely. But I’ve genuinely never experienced anything like that. If someone is coming up quickly behind me, I’ll usually step aside casually or pretend I’m looking at something. Not act personally targeted and offended.

If I had to keep walking, it would’ve made me worry about being followed. And of course, my brain tried to spiral about what I might have done to make the situation awkward, maybe that my energy was too intense. But honestly, I was literally wearing heart shaped glasses so idk 😭 I like being just another unknown person in a big city so stuff like this really bothers me.

It triggered me for a while after that and I started to become hyper aware of everyone.

1qp55q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qp55q9/lost_momentos_part_3/,Lost Momentos (Part 3),"Part 3:

As my body breached the dark, sleeping surface of the water, the first thing that struck me was the cold. Bone-chilling, brain-freezing temperatures encased me as I sank, bubbles of white, blue, and rainbow light glimmering around me. My cry was swallowed instantly by the all-encompassing void, the presumed tomb of my descent. Limbs flailed against the current that threatened to drag me under, the only break in the water’s cruel silence a loud splash following my futile resistance.

Eyes squeezed shut, my small puffy jacket clinging to me like Velcro, I cursed my lack of a life jacket. A stinging cold rushed into my lungs as I drew the first shuddering breath of the strength-sapping atmosphere. Panic fully set in when something warm brushed against one of my tiny arms. Struggling violently, I lashed out, but the invader clung to me with unnatural strength. I clawed at it until my face broke the icy surface. Blinking away water and ice from my lashes, my eyes locked onto my mother’s pearlescent orbs.

With every ounce of strength he could muster, my father heaved the full weight of my mother and me from the lake. We landed in a heap atop him, our soaked bodies shivering violently in the cold. My mother began compressions on my younger self, while my father fought the stubborn engine of the fishing boat. Distance to the shore was short, but it felt like an eternity before we ran aground and huddled together inside the warm cabin.

My grandmother was startled when we burst through the door, quickly taking my little brother from my grandfather as he moved to help. Blankets and towels were produced and wrapped around us within minutes, hands working to restore warmth and feeling to our numb extremities. My father and grandfather stepped onto the porch, voices raised in heated conversation over a fresh pot of coffee, while my grandmother heated apple cider for us to nurse. Just as I was handed a cup, hands still shaking, the men’s voices outside flared further, ending with my grandfather slamming the door open and storming to the back of the house.

\*\*\*

I must have hit my head during the jump; the throbbing pain was a dull but insistent reminder that I was alive. My eyelids eased apart to a second realization: my hands and arms were coated in the familiar viscous substance I had fought through in the subterranean chamber. Wiping it away cleared my vision somewhat, and I stripped my outer layer of clothing to clean the rest from my face and body.

Finally surveying my poorly lit surroundings, I saw a semicircle of yellowed mounds at the edges of my vision. Stepping closer, I found solid ground and pulled myself from the small pool where I had awoken. My foot struck something solid—my flashlight. Free from the bag and soaking wet, I gave it a few solid thwacks; after the fourth or fifth swing, it flickered to life. Thank God for DeWalt.

The giddiness of the recovered tool caught in my throat as I moved closer. The small hills I had been creeping toward revealed themselves in full horror: piles of bones, animals of all kinds, scattered and decayed. Worse, human remains were dotted among them, larger pieces mostly intact, smaller bits shattered and mixed with the earth. At the base of each pile lay a puddle of the same viscous goop that still clung to me, cracked green fragments scattered throughout the cavern.

As my breathing slowed, I waded back to the water, scanning for anything else washed ashore. The only sounds were dripping water and my cautious footsteps. I found my small shovel and a floating water bottle. Sipping cautiously, I reassessed my equipment and considered my next move: to find another way out without swimming again. This meant approaching the rotting piles, so I wrapped a shred of my shirt around my lower face to mask the stench.

Moving slowly in a circle around the grotesque mounds, I found no change in the terrain. A faint sense of calm settled over me before I returned to where I had begun scoping the area. Walls and ceiling yielded no escape routes. Steeling myself, I began sorting through the nearest pile. The bones were picked clean, yet as I sifted, a slow, rhythmic clattering began to echo through the chamber. At the base, viscera coated with the cavern’s hardened substance revealed jagged green-glass fragments jutting outward, glinting ominously in my flashlight’s beam.

As the sound of my rummaging escalated, I found a few discarded odds and ends scattered among the refuse. Mostly scraps of fabric and tattered bundles of fur, but enough to scrounge together a mostly intact shirt. Moving from my initially sorted pile to the next, a brief moment of stillness fell—at least from me. The slow clattering continued, unbroken, though now unaccompanied by my own movements. I froze, staring at the bones, shivering as a new presence stirred, threatening to burst free. Backing toward the water, my eyes locked on the motion, I heard a high-pitched whir pitch through my hearing aids, shrill and tight, almost like a dog whistle.

From within the bones, pale wriggling forms emerged, crawling free from their calcium-covered enclosures. They moved like caterpillars, dozens of them streaming from the exact spot I had just knelt. As each wave surfaced, the chorus of the room swelled, heads pointing upward as if in prayer. In the refracted light from the water, I saw their gaping maws lined with minute, razor-sharp teeth. My horror only deepened as I noticed similar activity across the rest of the decayed refuse. Each mass shuddered, collapsed, and was overtaken by dozens more of the crawling, shrieking creatures.

I dropped to my knees, clawing at the sides of my face, fighting every urge to rip my malfunctioning hearing aids free. Instead, I gripped my flashlight and shovel, backing away slowly. A sudden splash shattered my concentration. I whipped my head toward the noise and saw the familiar mass of aquatic life thrashing in the frothing pond. Stunned, I halted, focusing instead on the chaos surrounding me. The creatures’ soprano of shrieks ceased, the room falling into eerie, expectant silence.

After several breaths, a dragging sound began, steadily approaching. I clicked off my flashlight, crouching in a futile attempt to hide. When my knees hit the ground, a form was dragged and deposited atop the writhing invertebrates from above. I flinched at the thud of flesh hitting stone, bracing before flicking my flashlight on. The sparse battery revealed a sight that made my stomach twist: the crippled form of my father.

Huddled together, missing one leg of his work jeans, he appeared battered but not entirely destroyed. Most of his figure was stuck with the same green spheres I had seen clinging to Mr. Carlton. I inched closer cautiously, my foot striking a shard with a delicate tinkle—green glass.

The realization hit like a train: I had to move. All stealth abandoned, I rushed to my father’s side, checking his pulse like health class had taught me. A slow, steady beat confirmed he was alive. Carefully, I shredded the bits of uniform fused to the sickly pearls, freeing him. The creatures remained rigid, unblinking, almost statuesque. Only a single tumor-like growth on his right leg remained, his clothing otherwise intact. I heaved his body to the side of the cave. As one lone bone fell to the floor, the silence shattered.

Every malformed, limbless worm ceased its unholy prayers, fixating on the single fallen bone. I slowed, crawling with my father beside me, trying not to alert them further. When another worm caused a small avalanche of calcium dust, the creatures darted en masse to the deluge, intertwining and feeding on whatever they could claim. Heart hammering, I grabbed a piece of what looked like a femur and tossed it toward the water amidst the feeding mass.

I’d never been good at sports with a ball, but luck favored me in this instance. The bone landed just short of the water, barely touching the waves that lapped against the writhing bodies below. It skidded to a stop with a faint ripple and splash. The ground-based worms hesitated, consulting the validity of this new stimulus, before surging en masse, roiling and writhing toward the sound. Those unlucky enough to land in the water were immediately snatched and fought over by the gluttonous horrors below.

Seeing the first flicker of hope—or maybe just feeling bold enough to act—I rose carefully, bracing myself against the wall while gripping the shovel still strapped to my ragged leather belt. Shifting my weight from heels to balls of my feet, I edged closer to the writhing mass. Standing at arms-length, I eased the shovel free, eliciting a metallic “-dink” as it clashed against my belt buckle. The mass paused briefly, then continued, undeterred by my warning.

I loosed the tool fully, cocked my shoulders back, bent my knees, and swung with everything I had. The blade met solid flesh with a wet, sloshing sound. Many of the creatures were damaged on impact, but survivors careened lopsidedly toward the far wall. The volley of veinless forms collided with solid rock, spewing fragments in a small radius before collapsing into the water below. Murky, dull purple fluid coated the wall and my shovel. For a brief moment, I reveled in the effectiveness of my actions.

While the marine creatures feasted on the unexpected buffet, I moved a few feet from the remaining writhing reptiles. I stabbed downward, dispatching the last of the litter with calculated precision. As the flurry of motion in the pool waned, the tension in my body drained along with the adrenaline. Crawling slowly toward the wall where my father lay, I curled up in the elbow of a few stones beside him, finally falling into the deepest sleep I’d had in what felt like an eternity.

We’ve got three kids and somehow there’s *always* something I forget. A spirit day, a practice time change, a dentist appointment I definitely agreed to and then completely erased from my brain. We use Apple Calendar, texts, emails, school apps… none of it sticks.

What’s extra annoying is our house is “smart” in every other way. Lights, locks, thermostat, even the coffee maker. But our family schedule? Absolute chaos.

I started looking at those wall-mounted digital calendars thinking maybe seeing everything in one place would help. Skylight shows up everywhere, Cozyla looks huge and kind of intense, and then there’s a smaller one I found called Everblog that seems more focused on syncing calendars and basic family stuff like chores and meals.

But I keep wondering if this is just another thing that sounds great for a week and then everyone ignores it while I’m the only one still trying.

For parents who’ve actually figured something out:  
Do your kids ever look at shared schedules?  
Did anything actually reduce the mental load, or did you just get better at juggling?  
And how do you choose tools without spending way too much time researching every tiny difference?

1qp4zhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepaltrekkingpackages/comments/1qp4zhh/how_much_cash_do_i_need_for_trekking_in_nepal_a/,How Much Cash Do I Need for Trekking in Nepal? A Complete Guide,"Nepal is a dream destination for trekkers from around the world, offering iconic trails like the Everest Base Camp Trek, Annapurna Circuit Trek, and more remote paths in the Himalayas. But before you pack your trekking boots, one question pops up for every traveler: **“How much cash do I need for trekking in Nepal?”** Understanding the budget is crucial to avoid surprises on the trail, especially in regions where ATMs are scarce, and card payments aren’t always accepted.

In this guide, we’ll break down everything you need to know about budgeting for a trek in Nepal—from permits and accommodation to food, tips, and unexpected expenses.

# 1. Cash vs. Card: How to Carry Money in Nepal

Nepal is largely a **cash-based country**, especially in trekking regions. While Kathmandu and Pokhara have ATMs and accept international cards, once you are on trails like Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Base Camp, or Manaslu Circuit, you’ll find that **lodges, teahouses, and porters only accept cash**.

**Tip:** Always carry a mix of USD and Nepalese Rupees (NPR). Many trekking agencies and guesthouses in remote areas prefer USD, but local restaurants and shops generally charge in NPR.

# 2. Trekking Permits and Fees

Before hitting the trail, you’ll need certain permits. These are mandatory and vary depending on the trekking route.

* **TIMS Card (Trekkers’ Information Management System)**: $10–$20 USD
* **Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)**: \~$30 USD
* **Sagarmatha National Park Permit**: \~$30 USD
* **Manaslu Restricted Area Permit**: $70–$100 USD

These permit costs are fixed but must be budgeted in cash, as card payments are rarely accepted at checkpoints.

# 3. Daily Expenses on Trek

Your **daily trekking budget** depends on the trail and the style of trek. Here’s a breakdown for teahouse trekking:

* **Budget trekking**: $15–$25 USD per day
   * Dormitory rooms or shared teahouses
   * Simple meals like dal bhat, noodles, and tea
* **Mid-range trekking**: $25–$50 USD per day
   * Private rooms, hot showers where available
   * Mix of local and international meals
* **Luxury trekking**: $50–$100 USD per day
   * Premium lodges, private toilets, Wi-Fi, and western food

**Food costs on trek:**

* Dal Bhat (local meal): $3–$5 USD
* Noodles or fried rice: $2–$4 USD
* Tea or coffee: $1–$2 USD
* Bottled water (1L): $1–$2 USD

**Note:** Prices increase with altitude. For example, in Namche Bazaar or Dingboche, meals can be 1.5–2 times more expensive than in lower regions like Lukla or Besisahar.

# 4. Accommodation Costs

Most trekkers in Nepal rely on **teahouses**, which are simple lodges along the trails.

* **Low-budget teahouse room**: $3–$5 USD
* **Private mid-range room**: $7–$15 USD
* **Luxury room with attached bathroom**: $20–$40 USD

Lodges at higher altitudes are more basic. Some remote areas may charge more for electricity, hot showers, or blankets.

# 5. Transportation Costs

**Getting to and from the trailhead** also requires cash:

* **Kathmandu to Lukla flight (Everest Base Camp Trek)**: $180–$200 USD one way
* **Bus to Pokhara**: $8–$15 USD
* **Private taxi or jeep**: $50–$150 USD depending on distance

For remote treks like Upper Mustang or Manaslu, a portion of your budget should cover local transport and porters if needed.

# 6. Porter and Guide Fees

Hiring a **guide or porter** is common, especially for longer or high-altitude treks.

* **Guide**: $25–$35 USD per day
* **Porter**: $15–$25 USD per day
* **Tips**: $5–$10 per day is customary

Guides and porters also need to be paid in cash, so factor this into your budget.

# 7. Miscellaneous Expenses

Other costs to consider:

* Hot showers: $2–$5 USD per shower
* Internet/Wi-Fi: $2–$5 USD per hour
* Snacks, chocolate, or energy bars: $1–$3 USD each
* Souvenirs or trekking gear: $10–$50 USD depending on your shopping

**Tip:** Always keep some extra cash for emergencies, altitude sickness medicine, or last-minute changes.

# 8. How Much Cash Should You Actually Bring?

Here’s a rough estimate for **a 10–14 day trek in Nepal**:

|Trekking Style|Daily Cost (USD)|Total Trek Cost (USD)|Permit Fees (USD)|Transportation (USD)|Cash Needed (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Budget|20|200–280|30–50|20–100|250–430|
|Mid-range|35|350–490|30–50|50–150|430–690|
|Luxury|60|600–840|30–50|50–200|680–1090|

**Key takeaway:** For most trekkers, **$400–$700 USD** in cash is sufficient for a standard trek like Annapurna Base Camp or Everest Base Camp, including food, accommodation, permits, and minor expenses.

# 9. Tips for Handling Cash Safely

1. Carry **multiple small denominations** (100s and 500 NPR notes).
2. Keep cash in **different places** to avoid losing everything if something happens.
3. Use a **money belt** for extra safety.
4. Avoid exchanging money at random shops on trails—use banks or authorized exchange counters in Kathmandu or Pokhara.

# Final Thoughts

Nepal is affordable for trekkers, but **having enough cash is essential**, especially for remote regions where ATMs don’t exist. By planning ahead, budgeting wisely, and carrying a mix of USD and NPR, you can focus on enjoying your trek without worrying about money.

Whether you’re trekking to **Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, or Tilicho Lake**, this guide gives you a realistic picture of how much cash you need to make your Himalayan adventure smooth and stress-free.

**Remember:** Cash planning is part of the adventure. The more prepared you are, the more you can immerse yourself in the stunning landscapes of Nepal without financial worries.",1,1769586049.0,Nepaltrekkingpackages,0,1.0,False

I was super jacked at 110, but during a really bad relationship, I developed sciatica (he was a literal pain in my ass lol) and gained 30 lbs. Last year during a depressive episode, I gained another 20 and was 160. Now I'm 138 after working it off intentionally slowly beginning in April of last year and with some breaks.



Here's what I've been doing lately



No more calorie counting. I roughly know how much is enough and I trust my body when it's hungry. I'm focusing on fiber and eating a variety of plants. This feels much better already.



I start my mornings with a 2 mile walk while drinking my coffee. I am mainly a private gardener and I do massage every other weekend, so both jobs are active.



Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I like to rock climb and at the end of the session, I like to do 5 heavy weight lifting workouts for my lower body. Currently considering adding in a bike ride for the 6 mile journey to the climbing gym.



Tuesdays and Thursdays I do home Pilates videos. Tuesdays I might do a run or an extra walk, but on Thursdays, I do 2 hours of belly dancing. Considering doing boxing on Tuesdays instead of the run.

On weekends I like to hike and go searching for bugs and newts and flowers and document them simply for the fun of it.

  
I like this approach bc I feel like I am engaging with multiple aspects of myself without feeling like I am just trapped in the gym wracking my brain to try and be creative in a space where that's hard to do. My body gets to experience so many different kinds of movement and I like to just eat when I'm hungry without worrying about it.  I feel healthy and if I don't lose the rest of the weight, I am enjoying my quality of life enough to not really care anymore. It seems like it's happening anyway.

  
Just wanted to share because I see so many of my fellow petite baddies stressing over exercise and calories to modify themselves to fit into a certain aesthetic. I'm only 33 but I feel regret for how much I tortured myself with being hungry and doing activities I didn't want to do because I thought I was supposed to look a certain way. I used to be a back country stone mason and I would eat only the bare minimum trying to lose weight and it would barely work and I would be emotionally falling apart all the time. I  wish I could have a do over but I'm just glad I know better now.

Hope everyone is eating well and having fun!",4,1769585975.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

I just hit a personal milestone this week: I published my 12th book, [Unlimit ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB)🥳

Looking back at the dashboard, I’ve sold approximately 70,000 copies across all my titles since I began this self-publishing journey back in 2014.

For some, it might seem like a decent number. But I was in Japan in October and had the honor of meeting **Ken Honda** (author of *Happy Money*). For those who don't know him, he has sold over **9 million copies** of his books.

Meeting Ken gave me a new lifetime goal. I'm going to keep writing, publishing, and working with other authors until I reach the same level. Not overnight, but my plan is to keep showing up, writing the next page, and providing value in every chapter and blog post.

In this post I’ll share a bit about how I wrote the book in just six weeks, from writing to marketing and try to include as many helpful takeaways as I can. 

In the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here’s a quick outline of strategies anyone can use.

# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.

**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**

**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.

**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.

**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.

**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.",1,1769585558.0,KeepWriting,0,0.67,False

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on between trail runs and late-night coding sessions.
I’m a runner (the muddy, mountain-climbing kind) and a developer. I got fed up with two things: expensive monthly subscriptions and those ""stone-carved"" training plans. You know the ones—if you miss a Tuesday because of work or life, the whole plan falls apart and you feel like a failure.
So, I did the only logical (and exhausting) thing: I built my own coach.
It’s called Runvia. The idea hit me at the summit of Mount Manavello in Italy, lungs burning and legs on fire. I wanted an AI coach that actually acts human: if you’re too tired or miss a session, the app instantly recalculates your entire plan. No stress, just running.
Why am I posting here?
Because this is a 100% independent project. It’s free, has no ads, and I have zero interest in selling your data. That’s why I designed it to work with your own Google Gemini API key: your data stays yours, you get the AI power for free, and I can keep the app accessible to everyone.
I’ve just pushed a fix for a nasty bug involving large TCX files (thanks to the first few testers), and since I’m a one-man show, I’m currently focused on Android (iOS is coming as soon as I drink enough coffee to build it).
I’d love for you to check it out and give me your most brutal, constructive feedback—whether as a runner or a dev.
See you on the trails! 🚀

1qp4u65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp4u65,Potenza CP-25 Pumping Tip + Rejuran 4cc at Doctors Dermatology Dongdaemun,"Hello!
Wanted to drop by and share my experience with skin treatments this time round in Korea : Potenza Pumping tip (CP-25) with Rejuran Healer skin booster 4cc. I'm not a big review person but since it's my second time at this clinic, I thought I'd share as both my visits were q pleasant ☺️ Might be a bit lengthy bc I try to include as much info that I can in case anyone is interested in this procedure or is looking for a trustable clinic with a certified dermatologist!

I did also include a 1-day after procedure was done picture at the end of me as well in case anyone is curious how my skin looked like :)

I went with my friend as she wanted to try out Sofwave & Rejuran. I wanted to try Potenza with a pumping tip that could also inject the Rejuran at the same time (I read about it online prior to my visit and was curious about the effects). 

I did have numbing cream on for quite a bit before the procedure. However I genuinely think it was still quite painful especially around the temples region , cheek area (I tried to search up what it's called & it's called infraorbital I think) as well as my alar creases. On some areas where I had larger pores the device was held there for q a few extra pumps as well? I also didn't know I was tearing until I opened my eyes when the procedure ended 😅 Right after the procedure my face felt very hot a bit like how I'd feel in a sauna room & I also felt a stinging sensation that lasted about an hour or so. After that my face started to feel super tight (a bit like wearing an XS on an M) which is apparently called a ""shrink-wrap"" effect? 

I searched it up on Gemini and will summarise what I understood from the explanation (in case it's useful!) :

Potenza uses RF energy to heat the deeper layers of ur skin to stimulate collagen so the internal sunburn like feeling is the residual thermal energy in ur tissue. Bc I used the CP-25 pumping tip it physically pushes topicals (like Rejuran) into the micro-channels it creates. Rejuran itself has pdrn so while it's infused into the skin it'll feel extra stingy compared to standard HA's. Basically I have thousands of tiny ""injuries"" coupled with the pdrn being forced into my dermis which might naturally allow my skin to start its inflammatory response. 

I was informed to moisturise throughly 4-6 hours after the procedure was done & to drink lots of water as the microneedling part of the procedure kind of compromised my skin barrier for the time being. 

I was quite red for a bit (I included pictures of how it looked like after a night's sleep!) but I moisturised & masked religiously so the redness got a lot better on Day 3. 

It's been a week now since I got the treatment done and I definitely feel & see a difference in terms of pore size & skin texture. My skin feels extra smooth (and plump, Idk how to describe it but like a balloon with water??) & looks great (a bit glowy too) without makeup. I've also received quite a bit of comments on my skin looking better! 

This clinic was initially recommended to me by a friend of mine as she felt satisfied with the overall service, price and professionalism of the dermatologist during both consultation and procedure. The last time I came I got Rejuran HB & a few other procedures done and was happy with the outcome as well which was why I decided to come back. I paid 690000 KRW for the Potenza+pumping tip & 550000 KRW for Rejuran 4cc before tax (around £630) which felt very reasonable to me.

Thought I'd also include how the entire flow is like:
- Went to the front desk to register as I booked with them through WhatsApp which I found on their Instagram 
- Skin analysis 
- Got into the consultation room with the Dr. had a translator there present at all times. Was provided bottled water and snacks as well. Coffee can be requested too.
- After confirming the procedure & price, made the payment and was led to the private room where I had a greeting card with my name on it, a cupboard for my bags & robe & slippers to change into. 
- Someone came in to help with removing makeup / facial cleanse and mini facial massage
- Facial numbing cream
- Moved to the procedure room, translator also there throughout the procedure
- Back into private room

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

At first, everyone blames stress, age, or just “bad genetics.” But the stuff no one talks about enough is actually hormonal health. And no, it’s not just about testosterone or estrogen. We're talking thyroid, insulin, cortisol, and more. 

After getting bombarded by TikTok fitness bros selling hormone kits and “biohacks,” I finally dug into the Rich Roll Podcast episode with Dr. Kyle Gillett, an MD obsessed with holistic hormonal optimization. This post breaks down the 6 tools he shared that actually work (no needles, no pills, no influencer nonsense). It’s all science-backed, pulled from top podcasts, clinical research, and lifestyle medicine.

Best part? You can start today. 



**1. Prioritize consistent, deep sleep.**  

Sleep is when most of your hormone systems reset, especially growth hormone, testosterone, and cortisol.

According to Matthew Walker (author of ""Why We Sleep""), even one night of 5-6 hours can drop testosterone in men by 10-15%, while increasing cortisol the next day. Chronic poor sleep leads to insulin resistance and thyroid dysfunction.

Gillett recommends 7.5–9 hours, same bedtime every night. Blue-light blocking 1-2 hours before bed helps manage melatonin production.  

*Extra tip:* Try Andrew Huberman’s “sleep cocktail”: magnesium threonate + apigenin + theanine, 90 mins before sleep. 



**2. Ditch ultra-processed foods and go whole.** 

Your hormones are deeply affected by your diet. Especially insulin, leptin, and ghrelin (your hunger hormones).

A 2022 NIH study found people on ultra-processed diets ate 500 more calories per day on average than those on whole food diets, even when macros were matched.

Focus on high-protein meals with fiber and healthy fats. These balance blood sugar and stabilize insulin. Gillett emphasizes high omega-3 fats too (salmon, sardines, chia).  

Avoid seed oils, fake sugars. Less glucose spikes = less cortisol swings = better hormonal balance. 



**3. Strength training 3x a week, minimum.**  

Lifting weights boosts growth hormone, improves insulin sensitivity, and increases testosterone (for all genders).

A study in the ""Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism"" found that strength training increased testosterone in men and improved estrogen metabolism in women.

Don’t overdo it, though; overtraining wrecks cortisol. Gillett says, ""stimulate, don’t annihilate."" Compound lifts + walking + rest days = best combo. 



**4. Manage caffeine and morning light.**  

Most people overuse coffee and underuse sunlight. That’s a hormonal mismatch.

Huberman recommends delaying caffeine 90 mins after waking to avoid mid-day crashes caused by adenosine buildup.

Morning sunlight (even on cloudy days) helps align your circadian rhythm and supports cortisol and melatonin cycles. This isn’t hippie stuff, it’s circadian biology. 



**5. Get labs, track, don’t guess.**

Gillett is a fan of regular bloodwork, even if you feel “fine.” Suboptimal hormone function can be invisible for years.

Tests he recommends:

    \- Full thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)

    \- Fasting insulin (not just glucose)

    \- Testosterone, SHBG, Estradiol

    \- Cortisol (AM + PM if possible)

Tools like InsideTracker or working with a functional MD can reveal early imbalances before symptoms explode. 



**6. Ditch chronic stress cycles.** 

Cortisol is the hormone that saves your life or ruins your life, depending on your relationship with it.

Chronic social media scrolling, low recovery, and poor boundaries at work all spike stress hormones. That tanks every other hormone cascade.

Gillett recommends simple but effective tools:

    \- Zone 2 cardio (low heart rate activity for long durations)

    \- Mindful breathwork (Wim Hof, Dr. Andrew Weil’s 4-7-8 method)

    \- Phone detox 1–2 hours daily (even tech bros agree on this now)



**Bonus insight: Chronic inflammation is a hormone wrecker**  

Inflammation disrupts hormone receptor sensitivity. Even if you have “normal” hormone levels, they may not work properly. A 2020 study from ""Cell Metabolism"" showed that low-grade inflammation is a key cause of hormone resistance, especially insulin and thyroid. Eating anti-inflammatory foods, prioritizing sleep, and reducing artificial light at night all help reduce this burden.

This is not about taking testosterone shots or doing some cold plunge every morning. Hormone optimization is a long game. It starts with consistent, boring habits that build compound interest in your biology. If you're feeling off lately, physically, mentally, or emotionally, chances are one or more of these systems are out of tune.

There’s no perfect protocol. But the more aligned your daily habits are with your hormonal rhythm, the easier everything else gets.

1qp4qjs,https://i.redd.it/iulv1sjzk1gg1.png,Cheat Code Unlocked: Deleted His Core Data & Watched His Empire Burn.,"Just sign it. You're getting jack shit."" My husband Bryce shoved the papers at me. Next to him sat his lawyer. And next to the lawyer? Madison—his little side piece, belly already starting to show. Madison looked at me with this fake-sweet smile. ""Sloane, sweetie, just sign. He's letting you keep your dignity. That's more than most women get."" I signed. Walked out with nothing. He forgot ""nothing"" also meant no claims on each other's assets. Including MY code in HIS company. You wanted me gone, darling? Fine, enjoy your shell company. --- The conference room was dead quiet. Sunlight was streaming in through those huge windows, hitting the papers just right. I stared at my own name on that signature line. Looked weird. Foreign, almost. Sloane Mercer. That name had been mine for thirty-two years. Been attached to Bryce for five. Five years ago when we got married, he wasn't some hotshot CEO. Back then? Dude had just gotten fired from his product manager gig. Had maybe three months of severance pay in his pocket. I remember he told me he wanted to start his own thing. I asked him what. He said enterprise SaaS systems. I said that market's already packed. He said didn't matter—he had connections, resources. Just needed someone who could actually code. At the time, I was pulling in over half a mil a year as a tech lead at a big company. I said I'd do it. He just stared at me. Then smiled. That was the most genuine smile I ever saw on his face. ""Wait, seriously? You'd quit your job and do this with me?"" I said yeah. So we did. I quit. He cashed out his severance. We started writing code in our cramped apartment. Back then the company was literally just two people. Bryce handled clients, deals, investors. I handled everything tech. Who set up the entire server system? Me. Who built the database from scratch? Me. Every single line of code—frontend, backend, all of it? Yeah, that was me too. The day we launched our first product, Bryce posted on Instagram. ""Day 127 of the startup grind. Product finally live. Grateful for everyone who believed in me."" Picture? Just him sitting at a desk. His back to the camera. I saw that post at like 2 AM while I was fixing a bug on the live site. Three cups of coffee deep. Eyes barely staying open. I laughed. Didn't say anything. That post was just the beginning. First client signed? Bryce took them out to dinner. Didn't invite me. First round of funding hit the account? He posted again. ""So grateful to our investors and the team."" Picture? Him and the investor shaking hands. The team? At that point the entire tech department was me. Just me. I brought it up once. ""Hey, like... could you maybe throw my name in there when you post stuff?"" Bryce was on his phone. Didn't even look up till he hung up. ""Why would I do that? You're my wife. People are gonna think I'm playing favorites."" ""I'm literally running all the tech."" ""Yeah, and you're my wife."" He said it like that explained everything. ""Whatever you do, we did it together. Same thing."" I said there wasn't one. I really thought there wasn't. The company went from two people to twenty. Then from twenty to eighty. Bryce hired sales guys, marketing people, finance folks, admin staff. Just never hired tech. Okay, that's not totally true. He tried. Brought in three developers. They all left. Why? Because nobody could work with my code. The core system was mine. Only I could maintain it. New guys couldn't get up to speed. Even when they did, they couldn't keep up. Bryce said fine, you just keep doing it then. You're used to it anyway. I said okay. So I did it alone for five years. Only time I took leave was when I got appendicitis and had to get surgery. First day in the hospital, Bryce actually showed up. Stayed like three minutes. Maybe. Then suddenly he goes: ""Hey, what's the root password again?"" Chapter 2 I'm lying there in a hospital bed. Just got out of surgery. Still half out of it from the anesthesia. And I actually told him. He said thanks. Then left. Until fourth day I got discharged, he picked me up. In the car I asked what happened with the server. He said it was nothing major. Just a small bug. Fixed it. I said let me take a look. He said no need. Already handled. I asked who fixed it. He said he outsourced it. Right then this thought flashed through my head. But I didn't grab onto it. I should've. Year three, we closed our Series A. Company valued at thirty million. Bryce posted again. ""Grateful for this team, our investors, everyone who believed in us from day one. Three years. We actually did it."" Picture? Him and the investors. Sales team standing in the back. Comments full of people congratulating him. I commented: Congrats. Bryce just replied with a random meme. That night I asked him about equity. He said it was already divided up. Said I got five percent. I froze. Just stared at him. Five percent? I built this entire system. Every line of code—frontend, backend, database, algorithms. Three years. Just me. And he's just giving me five percent? Bryce saw I wasn't happy. He sighed. ""Look, I know you worked your ass off. But equity's not about hours worked. VP of Sales got five percent. CFO got five percent. Can't play favorites."" ""I've been here since day one. Nobody else."" ""You're my wife."" He said it like I was being ridiculous. ""What's mine is yours anyway. Why does this even matter?"" There it was again. That line. He used it every single time. I said fine. Five percent it is. Company valued at thirty mil. Five percent meant one and a half million. One and a half million for three years of my life. That's like five hundred grand a year. I used to make over six hundred grand. So actually, I took a pay cut. But I didn't say anything. He was my husband. We were family. Family doesn't keep score. Series A led to Series B. Series B led to Series C. Valuation went from thirty million to a hundred million. Then from a hundred million to three hundred million. My equity? Still five percent. Bryce's? Forty-two percent. I didn't ask why mine didn't go up. Scared he'd hit me with the ""you're my wife"" line again. Year four, at company holiday party, Bryce stood on stage in a sharp suit, looking like a million bucks. A hundred-plus employees sitting in the audience. ""Twenty million in revenue this year. First year we're profitable. That's all because of you guys."" Applause. ""Sales—you're out there closing deals every damn day."" Applause. ""Ops—you keep this place running."" Applause. ""Finance—you keep us from spending like idiots."" Applause. I sat there waiting for him to mention tech. He didn't. After the party, some new sales girl came up to me. ""So wait—what's your thing with Bryce?"" ""I run the tech side."" Her jaw dropped. ""Oh my god, I thought you were like his assistant!"" That night I couldn't let it go. ""How come you didn't mention me even once?"" He was undoing his tie. Stopped mid-motion. ""Why would I? You're my wife—everyone knows that. If I call you out by name, people think I'm playing favorites."" ""You didn't need to say I'm your wife. Just say 'the tech team' or something."" ""You are the whole tech team. Same difference. Still looks like I'm showing favoritism."" I didn't push it. He came over and rubbed my shoulder. ""Babe, don't stress about it. I know everything you put in. When we hit the next level, I'll sort out your equity. Trust me."" I said okay. Waited and waited. Five years later, my equity still didn't go up. But we did get Madison. Chapter 3 Madison was Bryce's admin hire. I met her on her first day. Pretty girl. Sweet talker. I didn't think much of it. Company had over a hundred people. Half of them were women. She wasn't the only pretty one. But I should've thought more about it. After Madison started, Bryce got busier. He used to come home by ten. Then it was eleven. Then midnight. I asked why he was so busy. He said we were gearing up for Series D. Lots going on. I asked if he needed help. He said no. Just keep an eye on the tech stuff. I believed him. About three months after Madison started, Bryce went to this admin team thing. ""Wait—you go to admin events now?"" ""It's not a 'team thing.' It's employee engagement. I'm supposed to show up."" Right. Then came the holiday party. Bryce planned the whole thing himself. Didn't ask me about any of it. They did a raffle. Take a guess who won the grand prize. Madison. Latest iPhone. Bryce walked it over to her personally. They took a photo together—both smiling huge. He posted it that same night: ""Our grand prize winner—some people have all the luck! ?"" Picture? Him and Madison. She's smiling huge. I sat in the audience, staring at that post. Something felt off. But I didn't say anything. I had too many things I wanted to say. If I said them out loud, he'd probably think I was being paranoid. Eight months in, I found it. Bryce came home after midnight. Didn't say a word—just went straight to the shower. His phone was on the couch. I wasn't going through his stuff. I swear. But it buzzed. Screen lit up right in front of me. Madison: Miss you I stopped breathing. Just stared at those two words. Then the screen went black. I put the phone back. He came out, hair dripping, grabbed it. Glanced at the screen—no expression. ""Who was that?"" ""Work."" ""Oh."" That's all I could get out. That night I couldn't sleep. Next morning after Bryce left, I opened the company's attendance system. As head of tech, I had backend access. I pulled up Bryce's and Madison's check-in records for the past three months. Their hours overlapped almost perfectly. Bryce worked late? Madison worked late. Bryce came in on weekends? Madison came in on weekends. I checked the building access logs. They swiped in and out together all the time. A few times the logs showed Madison swiping into Bryce's office. At 11 PM. I put my phone down. Took a deep breath. Told myself it was probably work-related. Told myself not to be paranoid. Told myself Bryce wasn't that kind of guy. Told myself he was my husband. We were family. Family doesn't keep secrets. I didn't say anything. One year after Madison started, I confirmed it. Bryce didn't come home that night. Said he had a work dinner. I opened the car tracker app. His car was parked at an apartment complex on the west side. I'd been there before. Last year during a company outing, Madison invited people over to her place for dinner. Same complex. I didn't go confront him. Drove to the complex and sat in my car for an hour instead. 1 AM, Bryce's car pulled out. Madison was in the passenger seat. They were talking about something. She was laughing. I just watched from a distance. Didn't get out. Next morning, Bryce came home. ""Drank too much at that dinner. Wasn't about to drive home drunk, so I just slept at the office."" ""Okay."" He looked at me like he just noticed I was there. ""You good? You look wiped."" ""Didn't sleep much."" ""Once work calms down, we should go somewhere. Get out of the city. You're working yourself to death."" ""Yeah. Sounds good."" It didn't sound good. Nothing he said sounded good anymore. After he left, I didn't cry. I sat on the couch for a long time. Then opened my laptop and got to work. For the next two months, I didn't bring it up. Bryce kept going to work, kept having ""dinners,"" kept not coming home. I kept writing code, fixing bugs, optimizing systems. We were gearing up for Series D. Things really were busy. My system needed a complete overhaul. Before the new version launched, I worked thirty days straight. Slept maybe four, five hours a night. Bryce never once asked if I was okay. One night at 2 AM, the server crashed. User data was at risk. I worked alone till 5 AM to fix it. That morning Bryce came into the office and saw me passed out at my desk. He shook me awake. ""Server good?"" ""Yeah."" ""Okay, cool. I've got investors at noon. Put together a tech brief for me."" Then he walked out. Never asked how long I'd been there. Never asked if I'd slept at all. Never asked anything. I was just a resource. Something you tap until it runs dry. Series D negotiations dragged for three months. Closed at three hundred mil. Eighty mil in new funding. Bryce was so hyped he literally did like three victory spins in his office. That night? He actually came home. With flowers. I thought—oh shit, is this it? Is he finally gonna say thank you? He sat down across from me. Got all serious. ""Babe, I gotta tell you something."" My brain went: Oh my god, is he finally doing the equity thing? ""Madison's pregnant.""

Not avery happy Valentine's day for the governing coalition. Christopher Luxon's push for the **Gene Technology Bill** in Parliament left Winston Peters, his deputy, to question the stances Nationals have. Winston opposed the idea of it passing without major changes but the push of the National leader made Winston doubt the direction of the National Party.

Winston also brought up the passing of the **RSB (Regulatory Standards Bill)** which they relunctantly voted for on the third reading due to coalition agreements.

In an interview with OneNews on February 8, Peters claimed that the government is losing the people and that without consulting their coalition partners, they have undermined the democratic process their institution aimed to protect.

Today, Winston Peters and New Zealand First gathered the press to claim one thing.



**The coalition is over.** The government is now relying on Confidence and Supply from both New Zealand First and ACT New Zealand.



***""We will no longer be a part of the government's debacle but we will not bring the people to an election that they don't want,""*** said Peters in the press conference.



New Zealand First and ACT still won't deny support on budgets and no motion of no confidence will pass the House of Representatives but the people are aware, now more than ever, of the shaky leadership Luxon made them belief. The truth is coming out. It is only a matter of time. In a few months, the elections will come and the government may be severely punished.

\---

**Darleen Tana**, the MP who jumped ships as an independent, was expelled from Parliament using the Waka Jumping Law. **Chloe Swarbrick** initiated the call and with approval, Tana was expelled and her seat replaced so that representation was in fact eqaul to the party vote they needed.

\---

**Chris Hipkins** met with one woman in Mt Albert. In a small coffee shop, two Labour leaders met. It was **Jacinda Ardern,** who swore to give up politics due to NZ First's defecting antics. Chris is seen convincing Jacinda to take the seat of Mt Albert next election and he would gladly give up the leadership so that Jacinda can bring back Labour's masses. He is secretly hoping for a sweep due to the coalition's collapse.  


*""Are you sure about no longer running? Not even as an MP?""*

*""I am not entirely closed to the idea of being a representative or even leading Labour but I will not work with Winston Peters.""*

*""We just need to carry the message to the people. Labour needs you.""*

*""I will think about it. Really think about it.""*

*""So how's life....""*

*---*

The coalition is no more. In a few weeks, the coalition of Luxon, Peters, and Seymour ended with just confidence and supply. They would not let a VONC in but the people know when politicians don't do thir jobs and just cling to power. Will Chris Hipkins convince Ardern to lead and win back Labour? How will this government act with two of its allies ready and able to dissent? How is Labour's standing alongside the Green's stability shape the election to come. Only time will tell but for now, the House still has confidence in its government...

It ranked #1 for hot new release in at least three categories, including currently #1 for entrepreneurship > management.** [**Here’s the book page for proof.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) **The book is basically a collection of 60+ chapters of “hacks” to work smarter and produce your best creative work.**

A bit of back story: I’m a person who is classically “unemployable.” 

Never worked any job for more than a month. Lived and traveled in 45+ countries, created various brands online (including a current huge summit for nomads in Nepal), and a growth hacking business where we’ve generated tens of millions of followers and tens of thousands of leads for our clients. My latest “growth hacking” experiment involves writing 104,000+ words in six weeks for my latest book, ‘Unlimit,’ setting a new personal record without using AI for writing. 100% original content.

**I became a solopreneur because I long for freedom like a drowning man longs for air.** While the online world offers us unlimited freedom, it is often skewed against the “little guy.” Many of us little players are “allowed to exist” at the pleasure of the big giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and so on. One algorithm change can be like a tsunami, overturning our little boat and leaving us treading water for survival.

And my experiences with the publishing industry is that they basically exist to exploit hardworking authors. 

For this reason, it’s essential that we lend a hand to one another whenever possible to cross this great ocean together. Figure out the best ways to work smarter and more efficiently, so that we can fight back, and go “toe to fin” with the big whales, krakens, and Leviathans out there to beat them at their own game.

For example: my first book (which I published way back in 2015), beat out James Altucher and Peter Thiel for the top spot: [https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg](https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg)

# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.

**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**

**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.

**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.

**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.

**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.

# How I Raised $16,000+ Before the Book Was Done

1. I pre-sold the book before writing it (300+ pre-orders through Publishizer).
2. I created a Kickstarter campaign with bonuses and rewards (the starter level includes 4 of my other books, and I can create additional rewards for exclusive trainings, courses, masterminds, and other resources).
3. I leveraged my network, social media, and different content marketing techniques to reach more readers.

**Crowdfunding Tricks and Tools**

📩 **Yet Another Mail Merge -** For just $36 a year, you can send up to 400 personalized messages per day. The $60 tier lets you send up to 1,500 per day. In my case, I purchased a list of 1 million Kickstarter backers from Fiverr, and contacted as many as I could. 

 **Sendfox -** Great tool for building a newsletter for beginners. For just $49 / 5,000 subscribers, you can get the tool for life on Appsumo, so you aren’t locked into monthly payments. 

**Pro-Tip:** Schedule Lives and Meets to “hang out” with your followers and readers in the weeks and months before your pre-launch campaign goes live. I started doing this for another author I’m working with, and it’s a great way to engage his readers and understand what topics are on their mind, as well as build up a list of supporters and backers. In his case, he’s a branding coach and we started hosting “roast my socials” where he looks at their website and social media and offers constructive advice for their business’ social media problems. 

**Create Viral Content**

There’s thousands of groups you can leverage on Facebook where you can share some of your content.

**Here’s some examples of posts I’ve made which have done well:**

**To improve your chances of virality:**

1. Choose large groups that already have high engagement (you often see these posts popping up in your feed from time to time)
2. Use eye-popping photos whenever possible – these are key for getting shares and engagement
3. Use an engaging hook, offer practical takeaways and value, use storytelling + lessons
4. Encourage people to comment or DM to get more information or to receive a freebie offer or bonus from you. **Every time someone comments on the post, it “bumps” it up again in the group, so more people can see it.**

**Launching the book on Amazon**

Ideally, you want all of your promotions and marketing to go out at the same time, to improve your chances that you can rise up the bestseller charts and claim the number one position.

**I bungled this badly.** It had been seven years since I published my previous book, and to say I was out of practice was an understatement! After submitting the book, I had to wait an additional day for Amazon Kindle to approve it and make it public on the store, and then I had to wait an additional day for my free promotion to begin.

So even though I planned my launch for January 15, it didn’t actually launch until January 17 (Asia time). Scheduled promotions ran on the wrong days, and various other hiccups occurred. Beta readers didn’t meet the requirements to write reviews. And so on. But I didn’t give up. The setbacks only steeled my resolve to the point where I was waking up at 4am and continuing until late just to promote the thing. 

**Here’s a working procedure of what an ideal launch schedule should look like:**

**Day 1: Publish the book.**

**Days 2-6: Get as many reviews as humanly possible. E-mail everyone you know. Ideally you gave out a bunch of copies to beta-readers a few weeks before publishing. Now’s the time to get in touch with them! This is also an ideal time to run your free promotion: ask people to download the book from Amazon for free, then write a review. It will be listed as a “Verified Purchase” review.**

**Days 7-9: get blasted out on 99 cent promo sites**

**Days 10-16ish: remain at 99 cents and get as many downloads as possible**

**Day 17ish: change to real price**

Remember, the 30-day “launch period” is critical if you want to get the #1 badge as a “hot new release” and potential best-seller: so you have to send as many free and paid downloads as you can during the promotion period, so that you can start ranking and get organic traffic from Amazon. 

**Here’s a huge list of resources I put together to promote your book, including book promotion sites and newsletters:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg\_FI/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg_FI/edit?tab=t.0) 

# Amazon Ads: A Trump Card? 

I took the free Amazon Ads course from Kindlepreneur and created three campaigns four or five days ago: one targeting a huge list of about 200 keywords of pain points people might search for that my book can help them with: “increase focus, stop procrastinating, improve energy,” etc.

Then I also created two other campaigns targeting specific books. I decided to focus on the other books in my category in the “hot new releases” lists, reasoning that these would be less competitive as they are new. 

I copied all 50 books from each category and pasted it all into chat GPT, which helped me create a list of ASINs that I could upload into the Amazon ads panel.

Unfortunately, Amazon ads hasn't really contributed anything in terms of clicks or sales yet. Although I set a budget of $12 per day per campaign, I think I only have about 16 impressions so far between the three campaigns. 

**Part of the trouble is that it seems to be very difficult to run Amazon ads profitably.** My book is currently at 99 cents which means I only get 35% royalties, so If I bid 35 cents per click, I have to have a 100% conversion rate on every click just to break even! 

For this reason, it becomes essential to advertise books that are part of a series or cross-promote your other books after the title page of your book to try and increase your revenue.

**Facebook advertising, on the other hand, is great if you want to turn on the traffic faucet quickly.** Although I also run ads from the ad panel, for my books I usually boost posts directly from my page and link directly to the book as this is a fast and easy way to send traffic and there’s a hundred other things I need to focus on during a launch besides running and split-testing ads from the ad manager.

Whenever I’m running Facebook ads to Amazon, I try to target cheap English speaking countries (like the Philippines and sometimes India) so that I don’t pay too much for clicks – an ebook download is a download, but one from the US could cost 20x more.

# Bonus: Sell the foreign rights of your book

This is free money. If you have a book with universal appeal that sells well, you can easily find an agent who can help you find someone to buy the foreign rights of your book. You give them the right to translate and sell your book in a country like Japan, or Brazil, in exchange for a paycheck.

My friend earned a cool $9,000 this way by selling the foreign rights to his book (through an agent) to a domestic publisher in South Korea.

**Easiest way to find foreign rights agents?**

Input the following search strings into Google and start connecting with people:

site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""agent""  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""manager""

**What’s Next?**

The book is still available for 99 cents for another week or so, and you can grab a copy if you are interested in more great content to help you grow in every major area of your life. If you’re a freelancer, creative, or a growth-minded individual who wants to tap into more of your potential, [**then I wrote this for you.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB)

**I believe that if you want to succeed at anything, such as writing, you need to treat it like a business.** Challenges will come, and things you didn’t plan for will threaten to set you back… but you keep moving forward. It takes a skilled and dedicated sailor to navigate stormy seas, not a lucky one. ",0,1769585078.0,SideProject,5,0.25,False
1qp4pp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1qp4pp7/logistics_of_applying_for_an_argentine_business/,Logistics of Applying for an Argentine Business Visa from Mumbai,"TL;DR at the end. Used LLM to clean up text.

Hey everyone,

I’m making this post because I couldn't find any concrete information on the actual logistics of applying for an Argentine visa from Mumbai online.

For context: I traveled for business (I manage a global team with a branch in Buenos Aires). While working for an MNC likely smoothed out the approval process, the physical logistics of the consulate visit apply to everyone, so I wanted to share my experience to help future travelers.

# Phase 1: The Application & Timeline

* **How to apply:** You need to prepare your documents and email them to **consular\_cgmum@mrecic.gov.ar**.
* **The Timeline:** They will check your docs via email and provide a date for the interview/submission.
   * *Warning:* It is highly advised to send your application **30 days before travel**.
   * *My Experience:* I sent mine 20 days prior. They accepted it as an exception but explicitly noted that they prefer the full 30-day window.

# Document Requirements (Crucial Details)

They are quite specific about the format of your documents:

* **Originals are Key:** They need *everything* in original hard copies.
* **Payslips:** If your payslips are computer-generated, I had to get them physically signed and stamped by my company HR.
* **Passport History:** You must produce **all** previous passports in original, including copies.
* **Cover Letter:** Be very specific. If you need a multi-entry visa, state that clearly in your letter.
* **Corrections:** The staff is helpful and will point out missing documents or necessary corrections on your visa form.

# Location & Logistics (Nariman Point)

* **Address:** The consulate is in the **Chander Mukhi Building** in Nariman Point.
* **Parking:** There is **no parking** in the building.
   * *Tip:* If you arrive early, park at the **CR2 Mall** nearby (costs a couple of hundred rupees). You can try hotel valets, but the mall is a safer bet.
* **Food/Amenities:** There are coffee shops and snack/juice stalls nearby for breakfast.
* **Restrooms:** Clean restrooms are available on the ground floor of the building and in the mall.

# The Interview Process

1. **Arrival:** I reached at 9:25 AM for a 9:30 AM slot. Punctuality is important.
2. **Waiting Area:** You hand over documents and wait. **No phone calls allowed**, but you can use your phone quietly for browsing/texting.
3. **The Interview:** My slot was 10:30 AM. It started on time and lasted only **5 minutes**.
   * *Questions:* Very basic questions regarding my role. I stressed that I travel often and required a long-term multi-entry visa.
   * *Outcome:* The interviewer was satisfied immediately and approved a **5-year visa**.

# Costs & Collection

* **Visa Fee:** **$200 USD**.
* **Payment Method:** **UPI or NEFT only.** They do **not** accept cards.
* *Note:* In my specific case, an official told me I didn't need to pay the fee (possibly waived because I was going to grow a local team), but you should go prepared to pay.
* **Collection:** You can choose to have it mailed or collect it in person.
   * I waited at a nearby Starbucks and collected it **2 hours later** without fuss.

**TL;DR:** The process is smooth if you follow guidelines strictly, specifically regarding ""Original"" documents and the 30-day application window.

Hope this helps anyone planning a trip to Argentina!

My husband gave that stripper his entire $500K bonus for her heart surgery.





I lost my fucking mind.





Smashed the house to pieces. Screamed every filthy word I knew.





""Get out! Don't bring your diseases near me!""





""Go die in a ditch with that slut!""





""You disgusting bastard! You'll always be trash!""





Damien crushed his cigarette bare-handed. Laughed like ice.





""Oh, you're so pure.""





""Weren't you the one who spread your legs at eighteen? Walked around school knocked up with my bastard?""





Every word was a knife.





He had no idea.





Right then—I was done.





Done with him.





Done with our baby.





The room went dead silent.





Our friends stood there—jaws on the floor.





Nobody cuts deeper than the person who knows where all your scars are.





I can still see that bathroom floor. The blood. The baby we lost.





Two broke college kids who couldn't even afford the surgery. Just a pack of abortion pills from some sketchy clinic.





That filthy public restroom. The pain ripping through me—endless, brutal. Eighteen-year-old Damien held me while I bled out, sobbing like his soul was tearing apart.





""Forgive me, Sera. God, I'm sorry. I'm a monster. This is all my fault...""





And now? Twelve years later, he threw that nightmare in my face.





Called me a whore.





All for some stripper named Chloe.





I went ghost-white. Couldn't even stand straight.





Damien rubbed his face, looking half-sorry.





His buddies rushed in like damage control.





""Sera, babe, this wasn't his fault. That psycho showed up at his office and cornered him.""





""Right! She literally got on her knees begging. Said she was dying. What's he supposed to do?""





""Come on, guys. It's almost the holidays. Every marriage has rough patches!""





I used to buy that.





That Damien just felt sorry for her.





A high school dropout working at some seedy massage parlor? I never thought he'd actually fall for trash like that.





Until he spent a year finding specialists for her ""broken heart.""





Until she whined about wanting to ""experience life,"" and he brought her to the company New Year's gala.





Until she cried about her shitty family, and he personally took her to Disneyland to ""heal her inner child.""





They kissed at the top of the Ferris wheel.





Security footage went viral.





That's how I found out my husband—who was ""too busy"" for a single dinner with me—was playing hero for another woman.





We exploded. Worst fight we'd ever had.





Damien swore she kissed him.





Said he just didn't push her away because she was crying.





It ended with him writing some bullshit promise: No more late nights.





I didn't know that was just the beginning of the nightmare.





Endless screaming matches. Freezing silences. Fake apologies.





Lipstick on the passenger seat.





Perfume stains on his collar.





He got colder. Meaner.





I got crazier.





Now I'm just... empty.





Damien gave that bitch everything.





His money. His time. His heart.





Might as well hand over the wedding ring too.





I smiled at them—hollow, broken.





""Won't be a marriage much longer.""





Damien's head snapped up. Like I'd slapped him.





""You want a divorce? Over half a million dollars?""





""Seraphina, are you out of your goddamn mind?!""





Unbelievable.





After everything. After he shredded every boundary I had. For her.





He still thought we were solid.





His phone rang.





That ringtone.





My blood boiled.





How many nights had I cried myself to sleep because of that sound?





He grabbed his jacket. Headed for the door.





""Where the hell do you think you're going?! Don't you dare walk out!""





I lunged in front of him.





We weren't done. And he was already running back to her.





""I'll handle this when I get back.""





""You take one step out that door, we're DONE.""





Chapter 2





""Damien, say something!""





""Bro, maybe you should stay with her. She's losing it—""





Everyone could see I was about to break.





Everyone except him.





He didn't even look back.





Damien's voice cut through the air—flat, annoyed.





""I've said everything I needed to say. She'll calm down in a few days and get over it.""





""We've been together for over a decade. You really think we'd split over something this small?""





I stood there, numb, as the door slammed shut.





In the living room, our massive wedding portrait lay shattered on the floor—destroyed in the chaos.





Tears hit the ground.





For years, I made excuses for him. Forgave him over and over.





But Damien wasn't that scruffy kid who used to sneak out to buy me street food anymore.





I was the only one clinging to ghosts.





Lying to myself every single day.





Now? I couldn't even believe my own lies.





I went straight to the hospital.





The doctor said my previous abortion had wrecked my uterine lining. Another procedure might leave me infertile for life.





I sat there. Numb. Signed the forms. Took the anesthesia. Climbed onto the table.





When the cold metal instruments entered my body, I didn't cry.





I just stared at the blinding white ceiling—remembering that sweltering afternoon when I was eighteen.





A grimy public restroom. Damien holding me tight, palms slick with sweat, eyes full of tears.





Back then, the pain was real.





The fear was real.





His heartbreak was real.





Now? He saves that for someone else.





When it was over, the nurse helped me off the table. Rattled off aftercare instructions I barely heard.





I shuffled out, one hand on the wall. Every step felt like walking through quicksand.





The hallway reeked of disinfectant.





And that's when I saw him.





My husband.





Arm around her.





That soft, gentle smile I used to think was just for me? He was giving it to Chloe.





I stopped. Watched them. Felt... nothing.





She was in a hospital gown, leaning against him like some fragile little doll.





He left to handle her admission paperwork.





Chloe noticed me. Paused. Then put on that sweet, innocent act.





""Seraphina? What are you doing here? Did you... follow us?""





She tilted her head, voice dripping fake concern.





""Damien's just helping me out because I don't have anyone. Please don't misunderstand, okay?""





She made sure to emphasize ""don't have anyone.""





My stomach was killing me. I didn't have the energy for her bullshit.





But the second I turned to leave—





Chloe lunged.





Dropped to her knees. Grabbed my pant leg.





""Seraphina, please! That $500K is pocket change to you—just a few designer bags! But for me? It's my life! The doctors said if I don't get this surgery now, I'll die. Please—don't take my survival money. I'm begging you. Once I'm better, I'll work myself to the bone to pay you back. I swear.""





Tears streamed down her face on cue.





Her voice echoed through the waiting room.





Everyone turned to stare. Whispers started.





""What kind of person fights a dying girl over money?""





""She looks rich too. How heartless can you be?""





""The poor thing's on her knees. Have some compassion!""





Cold sweat dripped down my back. I tried to pull my leg free.





Chloe collapsed to the floor, trembling like a broken bird.





Damien shoved through the crowd. Saw the scene. His face went black.





He yanked Chloe to her feet. Glared at me—eyes full of disgust.





""You followed me here? Just to harass a dying woman over money? Do you even have a soul?""





This wasn't new.





He'd said the same thing when Chloe ruined our anniversary with a phone call.





""She's suffering. You're a woman too—don't you feel anything?""





""How can you be this cold?""





I'd heard it all before.





Whatever.





But maybe we'd been fighting too much lately.





Maybe rage made him stupid.





Damien stepped forward. Shoved me.





""Say something! What the hell do you want?!""





I stumbled backward. Fell hard.





My tailbone slammed into the cold tile floor. A white-hot, tearing pain exploded through my abdomen.





Gasps filled the room.





I couldn't breathe.





Damien froze.





He had no idea why I went down so easily.





Just like he had no idea that while he was busy playing hero for Chloe—





The last thing tying us together had already died.





Chapter 3





He bent down to help me up.





I shoved him away.





""Damien.""





My voice came out raw.





""From now on? Give her whatever you want. I'm done.""





He froze.





I pushed myself off the floor and limped out of the hospital.





Outside, I pulled out my phone then called my lawyer.





He rattled off terms and clauses. Said the case was heavily in my favor.





I nodded. Felt nothing.





Just... tired.





I went back to the place I used to call home.





The second I opened the door, I heard it.





A woman's soft, flirty laugh.





He brought her here.





My blood boiled—then turned to ice.





I stood in the entryway, staring at the living room.





Chloe was wearing my slippers. Holding my favorite mug.





Damien sat beside her, scrolling through his phone—probably looking up medical stuff for her.





They looked like a cozy married couple.





They both looked up when they heard me.





Damien stood casually. ""You're back.""





Chloe set down the mug, face full of fake panic.





""Seraphina... please don't misunderstand. Damien just—""





""Just what?""





I cut her off. My voice shook with rage.





""Damien, what the hell is this? A hotel? Your little love nest? Am I a ghost to you?!""





""Seraphina!"" Damien's jaw tightened. ""Can you stop twisting everything into something dirty? Chloe's about to have surgery. Her condition's critical—her heart could give out any second. And her toxic family keeps harassing her. I can't let her stay alone.""





He stepped closer. Tried to take my hand.





For once, his voice softened—almost guilty.





""I promise. This is the last time. Once she's recovered, I'll cut ties completely. No more contact. We'll go back to normal. Okay?""





Go back to normal?





I wanted to throw up.





How many times had I heard that?





Every ""last time"" was followed by something worse.





I exhaled slowly. Pulled the divorce papers from my bag. Slammed them on the coffee table.





""Damien. Your promises are worthless.""





The papers hit the wood with a sharp crack.





Damien stared at them like they'd burned him.





His voice dropped to a growl.





""Seraphina!""





""You're serious? Over $500K? Over me letting a dying woman crash here for a few days? Our twelve years mean nothing to you?!""





""Twelve years?""





I laughed—cold, bitter.





""You have the audacity to talk about our relationship? Everyone knows you're fucking someone else!""





""I'm not!""





He snapped back, eyes red.





""I just feel sorry for her! You didn't used to be like this. You used to be kind. When did you become so cruel? So petty?""





""Right. I'm cruel. I'm petty.""





I nodded, voice eerily calm.





""So hurry up and sign.""

The café was running a promotion: buy one drink and get a free Pentarou keychain. Our young man was trying to buy as many as possible because he planned to give all 35 keychains to his girlfriends.

\- Rentarou: I'd like 10 more glasses of orange juice.

\- Employee: Sir, you've had quite a few drinks already.

\- Rentarou: Don't worry, I can still drink more.

The employee reluctantly prepared 10 glasses of orange juice for Rentarou, along with 10 Pentarou keychains. While carrying the tray of drinks, he bumped into a tall woman.

\- Rentarou: I'm sorry!

Their eyes met, and a telepathic connection flashed between them. Zing!

\- Rentarou: ""This is my destined lover!""

\- Employee: Are you alright, sir?

\- Rentarou: I'm fine... And that lady over there...

He glanced over and saw the girl quietly approaching a secluded corner of the shop and sitting down at a table. It was as if she didn't want to interact with too many people.

\- Rentarou: ""It seems she prefers being alone, doesn't it?""

He then approached the mysterious woman, his gaze sweeping across her face. Her hair was disheveled, obscuring one eye. The purple color was dreamy yet mysterious. Her eyes were listless, as if she hadn't had a proper rest.

\- Rentarou: ""She doesn't look well; her face looks a bit lifeless.""

She was frantically typing something on her laptop. The frantic clicking of the keyboard mingled with her heavy breathing. She flashed a smile, revealing sharp, animalistic teeth.

\- Rentarou: ""What kind of typing skills are these?! Wait... she's out of breath.""

\- ???: We need to add some drama to the story...

\- Rentarou: Sister! Stop! Any more and you'll be meeting your ancestors! Can you please breathe normally?

\- ???: Huh!?

She panicked, jumping and hitting her head on the pendant lamp. She collapsed onto the table, almost motionless.

\- Rentarou: Who installed that stupid lamp?! If I find them, I'll deal with them immediately!

Rentarou approached, checking on the woman's condition.

\- Rentarou: Thankfully, her pulse is still there.

A little while later, she woke up as if nothing had happened.

\- Rentarou: Sister... Are you okay?

\- ???: \*tired\* I'm fine... I just haven't had a good night's sleep for two days... I just dozed off for a bit.

\- Rentarou: You almost died. It wasn't just a nap.

\- ???: By the way, what's your name? Thank you for waking me up...

\- Rentarou: My name is Aijo Rentarou.

\- Youho: And my name is Hawamane Youho. Wait a minute... Rentarou, I think I've heard that name somewhere before.

\- Rentarou: You know me?

\- Youho: Well... I heard that in Ohananomitsu High School there's a large family with a son named Aijo Rentarou, and the rest are all women.

\- Rentarou: So you're in the same school as me? I'm in class 1-4.

\- Youho: So you're my junior... And I'm in class 3-2.

\- Rentarou: What were you typing on the keyboard all this time?

\- Youho: That's the script for the Film Club.

\- Rentarou: So you want to be a director?

\- Youho: I don't think I'm suited for that; I prefer writing. So my wish is to become a screenwriter.

\- Employee: Sir/Madam, your ice-cold latte has arrived.

The slippery floor caused the employee to stumble forward. The coffee was about to spill onto Youho's laptop and manuscripts.

\- Youho: My script! If I don't protect it quickly, it'll be ruined!

\- Rentarou: ""Her script, I have to protect it at all costs.""

Rentarou quickly stepped in to shield Youho. She managed to protect the manuscript she had painstakingly written for two days and two nights.

\- Rentarou: Are you okay, Hawamane-senpai?

\- Youho: I'm fine, the manuscript is fine. Are you okay?

\- Rentarou: I'm fine, just a little coffee stain on my shirt... Why is it so cold?! It feels like the cold is seeping into my bones.

\- Youho: This is Serious Corporation's coffee, I drink a lot of it so I'm used to it... That cold feeling is amazing.

\- Rentarou: I don't think anyone else would dare drink it besides you.

After a while, Rentarou took off her jacket to let the coffee dry. The two continued their conversation.

\- Rentarou: Hawamane-senpai seems very dedicated to these scripts, doesn't she? Can I take a look?

\- Youho: I can't show you the one I'm writing. As for this one...

When Youho took out a very old, tattered collection of manuscripts, it looked like it had been edited many times. This showed how much effort and time Youho had put into this script. But after a moment, she pulled it back, not letting Rentarou see it.

\- Youho: I think you won't like this... I think you'll be so scared you won't dare sleep after reading it.

\- Rentarou: ""I really want to see it! Because it's your brainchild. I want to see it even more!""

Youho reluctantly handed it to Rentarou. He began flipping through the pages to read. His initially cheerful expression gradually turned pale, and fear began to show. Although he believed ghosts weren't real, reading Youho's script made him feel as if vengeful spirits truly existed around him. A feeling of dread overwhelmed Rentarou, urging him to throw it away.

\- Rentarou: ""No! This is Hawamane-senpai's work. I can't trample on her hard work.""

As he raised his arm to throw it, his other hand grabbed it and snapped it with a crack.

\- Rentarou: \*sweating\* I've finished reading it. Your script is amazing. I'm looking forward to the day it's shown on screen.

When he looked up at Youho, Rentarou saw her in the same state as when she was typing. A bright smile and sharp teeth. It gave Rentarou a spooky yet charming feeling.

\- Youho: It's great, isn't it?

\- Rentarou: \*shivers, nods repeatedly\* Yes, it is.

\- Youho: Hahaha! I've never met anyone with such rich expressions as you. Your expression of fear is something I've never seen before. I want to see more of it.

Before Rentarou could react, Youho returned to her normal state. She became shy and embarrassed as Rentarou finished reading the script.

\- Youho: How did you feel... about it?

\- Rentarou: Your work frightened me; it felt like I became a character in a horror movie. It felt so real.

\- Youho: Thank you for your comment.

\- Rentarou: But what about that other expression...? I saw you smiling very happily then.

\- Youho: That's something I always hide... Because people would be scared if they saw it... That state always appears when I'm exposed to scary things, and sometimes when I see other people's expressions of fear.

\- Rentarou: You don't need to hide anything from me. I want you to show all your emotions. Even if it scares me, I won't hate it.

\- Youho: ""That kid... He accepts that personality. Why is my heart so chaotic... Is this love?""

Rentarou saw Youho's face flush red, her lips pressed together as if she wanted to say something. Seeing that, his heart pounded.

\- Rentarou: ""Her shyness... So cute!!!!!!""

\- Youho: Rentarou... I didn't hate your other personality... The one that's been bothering you... I wonder if that's a sign of my love for you?

\- Rentarou: I can tell you that it's love. I feel the same way seeing you with your determination and passion. I love you too, and I'd be happy if you could be my girlfriend.

\- Youho: Rentarou... Can you accept me as your girlfriend?

\- Rentarou: \*sweating\* Yes, I accept your feelings. But I must say beforehand that I've had 35 girlfriends already.

\- Youho: Really? But as long as you still love me, I don't mind.

I currently work at a grocery store, and there is a girl there I think is cute. We work in different departments, so we haven’t talked very much in the past. She works in the coffee bar. Very recently though, as in the past three-ish weeks, she’s suddenly gone out of her way to socialize with me and has been very friendly about it. 



List of examples include: 

* Randomly popped up in my department area asking if I would like some water. (Obviously I didn’t say no to free water). 
* Has waved to and greeted me almost every time I’ve clocked in. (She never did that until recently).
* Has randomly chatted with me a few times while we’re both working (sometimes I initiated these conversations, sometimes it’s been her). 
* Has offered to help me at least once, despite the fact that her job and mine are completely different. 
* Ran up to me today excitedly saying: “You’re here! How are you?” and gave me a hug. (No one is that excited to see me, let alone hug me). When I ask her back how she’s doing, she says “Better!” 



She’s a friendly person in general and occasionally goes up to random coworkers to talk to them when her department isn’t busy, but the suddenness of this feels very deliberate. 

I’m a 28 year old loser with virtually no dating experience whatsoever, so while it may feel as though she likes me, I just want to be sure so I can know how to proceed.

My husband gave that stripper his entire $500K bonus for her heart surgery.





I lost my fucking mind.





Smashed the house to pieces. Screamed every filthy word I knew.





""Get out! Don't bring your diseases near me!""





""Go die in a ditch with that slut!""





""You disgusting bastard! You'll always be trash!""





Damien crushed his cigarette bare-handed. Laughed like ice.





""Oh, you're so pure.""





""Weren't you the one who spread your legs at eighteen? Walked around school knocked up with my bastard?""





Every word was a knife.





He had no idea.





Right then—I was done.





Done with him.





Done with our baby.





The room went dead silent.





Our friends stood there—jaws on the floor.





Nobody cuts deeper than the person who knows where all your scars are.





I can still see that bathroom floor. The blood. The baby we lost.





Two broke college kids who couldn't even afford the surgery. Just a pack of abortion pills from some sketchy clinic.





That filthy public restroom. The pain ripping through me—endless, brutal. Eighteen-year-old Damien held me while I bled out, sobbing like his soul was tearing apart.





""Forgive me, Sera. God, I'm sorry. I'm a monster. This is all my fault...""





And now? Twelve years later, he threw that nightmare in my face.





Called me a whore.





All for some stripper named Chloe.





I went ghost-white. Couldn't even stand straight.





Damien rubbed his face, looking half-sorry.





His buddies rushed in like damage control.





""Sera, babe, this wasn't his fault. That psycho showed up at his office and cornered him.""





""Right! She literally got on her knees begging. Said she was dying. What's he supposed to do?""





""Come on, guys. It's almost the holidays. Every marriage has rough patches!""





I used to buy that.





That Damien just felt sorry for her.





A high school dropout working at some seedy massage parlor? I never thought he'd actually fall for trash like that.





Until he spent a year finding specialists for her ""broken heart.""





Until she whined about wanting to ""experience life,"" and he brought her to the company New Year's gala.





Until she cried about her shitty family, and he personally took her to Disneyland to ""heal her inner child.""





They kissed at the top of the Ferris wheel.





Security footage went viral.





That's how I found out my husband—who was ""too busy"" for a single dinner with me—was playing hero for another woman.





We exploded. Worst fight we'd ever had.





Damien swore she kissed him.





Said he just didn't push her away because she was crying.





It ended with him writing some bullshit promise: No more late nights.





I didn't know that was just the beginning of the nightmare.





Endless screaming matches. Freezing silences. Fake apologies.





Lipstick on the passenger seat.





Perfume stains on his collar.





He got colder. Meaner.





I got crazier.





Now I'm just... empty.





Damien gave that bitch everything.





His money. His time. His heart.





Might as well hand over the wedding ring too.





I smiled at them—hollow, broken.





""Won't be a marriage much longer.""





Damien's head snapped up. Like I'd slapped him.





""You want a divorce? Over half a million dollars?""





""Seraphina, are you out of your goddamn mind?!""





Unbelievable.





After everything. After he shredded every boundary I had. For her.





He still thought we were solid.





His phone rang.





That ringtone.





My blood boiled.





How many nights had I cried myself to sleep because of that sound?





He grabbed his jacket. Headed for the door.





""Where the hell do you think you're going?! Don't you dare walk out!""





I lunged in front of him.





We weren't done. And he was already running back to her.





""I'll handle this when I get back.""





""You take one step out that door, we're DONE.""





Chapter 2





""Damien, say something!""





""Bro, maybe you should stay with her. She's losing it—""





Everyone could see I was about to break.





Everyone except him.





He didn't even look back.





Damien's voice cut through the air—flat, annoyed.





""I've said everything I needed to say. She'll calm down in a few days and get over it.""





""We've been together for over a decade. You really think we'd split over something this small?""





I stood there, numb, as the door slammed shut.





In the living room, our massive wedding portrait lay shattered on the floor—destroyed in the chaos.





Tears hit the ground.





For years, I made excuses for him. Forgave him over and over.





But Damien wasn't that scruffy kid who used to sneak out to buy me street food anymore.





I was the only one clinging to ghosts.





Lying to myself every single day.





Now? I couldn't even believe my own lies.





I went straight to the hospital.





The doctor said my previous abortion had wrecked my uterine lining. Another procedure might leave me infertile for life.





I sat there. Numb. Signed the forms. Took the anesthesia. Climbed onto the table.





When the cold metal instruments entered my body, I didn't cry.





I just stared at the blinding white ceiling—remembering that sweltering afternoon when I was eighteen.





A grimy public restroom. Damien holding me tight, palms slick with sweat, eyes full of tears.





Back then, the pain was real.





The fear was real.





His heartbreak was real.





Now? He saves that for someone else.





When it was over, the nurse helped me off the table. Rattled off aftercare instructions I barely heard.





I shuffled out, one hand on the wall. Every step felt like walking through quicksand.





The hallway reeked of disinfectant.





And that's when I saw him.





My husband.





Arm around her.





That soft, gentle smile I used to think was just for me? He was giving it to Chloe.





I stopped. Watched them. Felt... nothing.





She was in a hospital gown, leaning against him like some fragile little doll.





He left to handle her admission paperwork.





Chloe noticed me. Paused. Then put on that sweet, innocent act.





""Seraphina? What are you doing here? Did you... follow us?""





She tilted her head, voice dripping fake concern.





""Damien's just helping me out because I don't have anyone. Please don't misunderstand, okay?""





She made sure to emphasize ""don't have anyone.""





My stomach was killing me. I didn't have the energy for her bullshit.





But the second I turned to leave—





Chloe lunged.





Dropped to her knees. Grabbed my pant leg.





""Seraphina, please! That $500K is pocket change to you—just a few designer bags! But for me? It's my life! The doctors said if I don't get this surgery now, I'll die. Please—don't take my survival money. I'm begging you. Once I'm better, I'll work myself to the bone to pay you back. I swear.""





Tears streamed down her face on cue.





Her voice echoed through the waiting room.





Everyone turned to stare. Whispers started.





""What kind of person fights a dying girl over money?""





""She looks rich too. How heartless can you be?""





""The poor thing's on her knees. Have some compassion!""





Cold sweat dripped down my back. I tried to pull my leg free.





Chloe collapsed to the floor, trembling like a broken bird.





Damien shoved through the crowd. Saw the scene. His face went black.





He yanked Chloe to her feet. Glared at me—eyes full of disgust.





""You followed me here? Just to harass a dying woman over money? Do you even have a soul?""





This wasn't new.





He'd said the same thing when Chloe ruined our anniversary with a phone call.





""She's suffering. You're a woman too—don't you feel anything?""





""How can you be this cold?""





I'd heard it all before.





Whatever.





But maybe we'd been fighting too much lately.





Maybe rage made him stupid.





Damien stepped forward. Shoved me.





""Say something! What the hell do you want?!""





I stumbled backward. Fell hard.





My tailbone slammed into the cold tile floor. A white-hot, tearing pain exploded through my abdomen.





Gasps filled the room.





I couldn't breathe.





Damien froze.





He had no idea why I went down so easily.





Just like he had no idea that while he was busy playing hero for Chloe—





The last thing tying us together had already died.





Chapter 3





He bent down to help me up.





I shoved him away.





""Damien.""





My voice came out raw.





""From now on? Give her whatever you want. I'm done.""





He froze.





I pushed myself off the floor and limped out of the hospital.





Outside, I pulled out my phone then called my lawyer.





He rattled off terms and clauses. Said the case was heavily in my favor.





I nodded. Felt nothing.





Just... tired.





I went back to the place I used to call home.





The second I opened the door, I heard it.





A woman's soft, flirty laugh.





He brought her here.





My blood boiled—then turned to ice.





I stood in the entryway, staring at the living room.





Chloe was wearing my slippers. Holding my favorite mug.





Damien sat beside her, scrolling through his phone—probably looking up medical stuff for her.





They looked like a cozy married couple.





They both looked up when they heard me.





Damien stood casually. ""You're back.""





Chloe set down the mug, face full of fake panic.





""Seraphina... please don't misunderstand. Damien just—""





""Just what?""





I cut her off. My voice shook with rage.





""Damien, what the hell is this? A hotel? Your little love nest? Am I a ghost to you?!""





""Seraphina!"" Damien's jaw tightened. ""Can you stop twisting everything into something dirty? Chloe's about to have surgery. Her condition's critical—her heart could give out any second. And her toxic family keeps harassing her. I can't let her stay alone.""





He stepped closer. Tried to take my hand.





For once, his voice softened—almost guilty.





""I promise. This is the last time. Once she's recovered, I'll cut ties completely. No more contact. We'll go back to normal. Okay?""





Go back to normal?





I wanted to throw up.





How many times had I heard that?





Every ""last time"" was followed by something worse.





I exhaled slowly. Pulled the divorce papers from my bag. Slammed them on the coffee table.





""Damien. Your promises are worthless.""





The papers hit the wood with a sharp crack.





Damien stared at them like they'd burned him.





His voice dropped to a growl.





""Seraphina!""





""You're serious? Over $500K? Over me letting a dying woman crash here for a few days? Our twelve years mean nothing to you?!""





""Twelve years?""





I laughed—cold, bitter.





""You have the audacity to talk about our relationship? Everyone knows you're fucking someone else!""





""I'm not!""





He snapped back, eyes red.





""I just feel sorry for her! You didn't used to be like this. You used to be kind. When did you become so cruel? So petty?""





""Right. I'm cruel. I'm petty.""





I nodded, voice eerily calm.





""So hurry up and sign.""

It ranked #1 for hot new release in at least three categories, including currently #1 for entrepreneurship > management.** [**Here’s the book page for proof.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) **The book is basically a collection of 60+ chapters of “hacks” to work smarter and produce your best creative work.**

A bit of back story: I’m a person who is classically “unemployable.” 

Never worked any job for more than a month. Lived and traveled in 45+ countries, created various brands online (including a current huge summit for nomads in Nepal), and a growth hacking business where we’ve generated tens of millions of followers and tens of thousands of leads for our clients. My latest “growth hacking” experiment involves writing 104,000+ words in six weeks for my latest book, ‘Unlimit,’ setting a new personal record without using AI for writing. 100% original content.

**I became a solopreneur because I long for freedom like a drowning man longs for air.** While the online world offers us unlimited freedom, it is often skewed against the “little guy.” Many of us little players are “allowed to exist” at the pleasure of the big giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and so on. One algorithm change can be like a tsunami, overturning our little boat and leaving us treading water for survival.

And my experiences with the publishing industry is that they basically exist to exploit hardworking authors. 

For this reason, it’s essential that we lend a hand to one another whenever possible to cross this great ocean together. Figure out the best ways to work smarter and more efficiently, so that we can fight back, and go “toe to fin” with the big whales, krakens, and Leviathans out there to beat them at their own game.

For example: my first book (which I published way back in 2015), beat out James Altucher and Peter Thiel for the top spot: [https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg](https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg)

In the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here’s a quick outline of strategies anyone can use.

# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.

**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**

**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.

**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.

**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.

**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.

# How I Raised $16,000+ Before the Book Was Done

1. I pre-sold the book before writing it (300+ pre-orders through Publishizer).
2. I created a Kickstarter campaign with bonuses and rewards (the starter level includes 4 of my other books, and I can create additional rewards for exclusive trainings, courses, masterminds, and other resources).
3. I leveraged my network, social media, and different content marketing techniques to reach more readers.

**To improve your chances of virality:**

1. Choose large groups that already have high engagement (you often see these posts popping up in your feed from time to time)
2. Use eye-popping photos whenever possible – these are key for getting shares and engagement
3. Use an engaging hook, offer practical takeaways and value, use storytelling + lessons
4. Encourage people to comment or DM to get more information or to receive a freebie offer or bonus from you. **Every time someone comments on the post, it “bumps” it up again in the group, so more people can see it.**

**Launching the book on Amazon**

Ideally, you want all of your promotions and marketing to go out at the same time, to improve your chances that you can rise up the bestseller charts and claim the number one position.

**I bungled this badly.** It had been seven years since I published my previous book, and to say I was out of practice was an understatement! After submitting the book, I had to wait an additional day for Amazon Kindle to approve it and make it public on the store, and then I had to wait an additional day for my free promotion to begin.

So even though I planned my launch for January 15, it didn’t actually launch until January 17 (Asia time). Scheduled promotions ran on the wrong days, and various other hiccups occurred. Beta readers didn’t meet the requirements to write reviews. And so on. But I didn’t give up. The setbacks only steeled my resolve to the point where I was waking up at 4am and continuing until late just to promote the thing. 

**Here’s a working procedure of what an ideal launch schedule should look like:**

**Day 1: Publish the book.**

**Days 2-6: Get as many reviews as humanly possible. E-mail everyone you know. Ideally you gave out a bunch of copies to beta-readers a few weeks before publishing. Now’s the time to get in touch with them! This is also an ideal time to run your free promotion: ask people to download the book from Amazon for free, then write a review. It will be listed as a “Verified Purchase” review.**

**Days 7-9: get blasted out on 99 cent promo sites**

**Days 10-16ish: remain at 99 cents and get as many downloads as possible**

**Day 17ish: change to real price**

Remember, the 30-day “launch period” is critical if you want to get the #1 badge as a “hot new release” and potential best-seller: so you have to send as many free and paid downloads as you can during the promotion period, so that you can start ranking and get organic traffic from Amazon. 

**Here’s a huge list of resources I put together to promote your book, including book promotion sites and newsletters:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg\_FI/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg_FI/edit?tab=t.0) 

# Amazon Ads: A Trump Card? 

I took the free Amazon Ads course from Kindlepreneur and created three campaigns four or five days ago: one targeting a huge list of about 200 keywords of pain points people might search for that my book can help them with: “increase focus, stop procrastinating, improve energy,” etc.

Then I also created two other campaigns targeting specific books. I decided to focus on the other books in my category in the “hot new releases” lists, reasoning that these would be less competitive as they are new. 

I copied all 50 books from each category and pasted it all into chat GPT, which helped me create a list of ASINs that I could upload into the Amazon ads panel.

Unfortunately, Amazon ads hasn't really contributed anything in terms of clicks or sales yet. Although I set a budget of $12 per day per campaign, I think I only have about 16 impressions so far between the three campaigns. 

**Part of the trouble is that it seems to be very difficult to run Amazon ads profitably.** My book is currently at 99 cents which means I only get 35% royalties, so If I bid 35 cents per click, I have to have a 100% conversion rate on every click just to break even! 

For this reason, it becomes essential to advertise books that are part of a series or cross-promote your other books after the title page of your book to try and increase your revenue.

**Facebook advertising, on the other hand, is great if you want to turn on the traffic faucet quickly.** Although I also run ads from the ad panel, for my books I usually boost posts directly from my page and link directly to the book as this is a fast and easy way to send traffic and there’s a hundred other things I need to focus on during a launch besides running and split-testing ads from the ad manager.

Whenever I’m running Facebook ads to Amazon, I try to target cheap English speaking countries (like the Philippines and sometimes India) so that I don’t pay too much for clicks – an ebook download is a download, but one from the US could cost 20x more.

# Bonus: Sell the foreign rights of your book

This is free money. If you have a book with universal appeal that sells well, you can easily find an agent who can help you find someone to buy the foreign rights of your book. You give them the right to translate and sell your book in a country like Japan, or Brazil, in exchange for a paycheck.

My friend earned a cool $9,000 this way by selling the foreign rights to his book (through an agent) to a domestic publisher in South Korea.

**Easiest way to find foreign rights agents?**

Input the following search strings into Google and start connecting with people:

site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""agent""  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""manager""

**What’s Next?**

The book is still available for 99 cents for another week or so, and you can grab a copy if you are interested in more great content to help you grow in every major area of your life.

A bit of back story: I’m a person who is classically “unemployable.” 

Never worked any job for more than a month. Lived and traveled in 45+ countries, created various brands online (including a current huge summit for nomads in Nepal), and a growth hacking business where we’ve generated tens of millions of followers and tens of thousands of leads for our clients. My latest “growth hacking” experiment involves writing 104,000+ words in six weeks for my latest book, ‘Unlimit,’ setting a new personal record without using AI for writing. 100% original content.

**I became a solopreneur because I long for freedom like a drowning man longs for air.** While the online world offers us unlimited freedom, it is often skewed against the “little guy.” Many of us little players are “allowed to exist” at the pleasure of the big giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and so on. One algorithm change can be like a tsunami, overturning our little boat and leaving us treading water for survival.

And my experiences with the publishing industry is that they basically exist to exploit hardworking authors. 

For this reason, it’s essential that we lend a hand to one another whenever possible to cross this great ocean together. Figure out the best ways to work smarter and more efficiently, so that we can fight back, and go “toe to fin” with the big whales, krakens, and Leviathans out there to beat them at their own game.

For example: my first book (which I published way back in 2015), beat out James Altucher and Peter Thiel for the top spot: [https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg](https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg)

In this post I’ll share a bit about how I did, from writing to marketing and try to include as many takeaways as I can. Shiva willing, you can self-publish your own book and not be at the mercy of the publishing industry. 

At the bottom of this post are a bunch of free resources for promoting and launching your book such as promotion newsletters for books, marketing services that deliver ROI, and much more.

In the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here’s a quick outline of strategies anyone can use.

# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.

**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**

**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.

**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.

**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.

**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.

Unfortunately, Amazon ads hasn't really contributed anything in terms of clicks or sales yet. Although I set a budget of $12 per day per campaign, I think I only have about 16 impressions so far between the three campaigns. 

**Part of the trouble is that it seems to be very difficult to run Amazon ads profitably.** My book is currently at 99 cents which means I only get 35% royalties, so If I bid 35 cents per click, I have to have a 100% conversion rate on every click just to break even! 

For this reason, it becomes essential to advertise books that are part of a series or cross-promote your other books after the title page of your book to try and increase your revenue.

**Facebook advertising, on the other hand, is great if you want to turn on the traffic faucet quickly.** Although I also run ads from the ad panel, for my books I usually boost posts directly from my page and link directly to the book as this is a fast and easy way to send traffic and there’s a hundred other things I need to focus on during a launch besides running and split-testing ads from the ad manager.

Whenever I’m running Facebook ads to Amazon, I try to target cheap English speaking countries (like the Philippines and sometimes India) so that I don’t pay too much for clicks – an ebook download is a download, but one from the US could cost 20x more.

# Bonus: Sell the foreign rights of your book

This is free money. If you have a book with universal appeal that sells well, you can easily find an agent who can help you find someone to buy the foreign rights of your book. You give them the right to translate and sell your book in a country like Japan, or Brazil, in exchange for a paycheck.

My friend earned a cool $9,000 this way by selling the foreign rights to his book (through an agent) to a domestic publisher in South Korea.

**Easiest way to find foreign rights agents?**

Input the following search strings into Google and start connecting with people:

site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""agent""  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""manager""

**What’s Next?**

The book is still available for 99 cents for another week or so, and you can grab a copy if you are interested in more great content to help you grow in every major area of your life.

How do I handle my feelings?,"This is a crazy situation and I feel like an idiot, but I really don‘t have anyone I can talk to about this in real life, so I’m here. For a bit of context, I (21F) witnessed my mom (47F) have an affair. It destroyed our family. She eventually broke it off, but her actions still haunt me.

For the “love triangle”, if you could call it that…it’s entirely my fault and I have no idea what to do. Long story short, I met “Tom” (name changed for privacy reasons) who’s 21 and attends the same university as me. He asked me out for coffee at a local cafe and I accepted his offer. We ended up chatting for a couple of hours. He seems like a nice guy. He is very intelligent; he’s studying to be a doctor, same as me, and he also refurbishes old computers and upsells them. We both love nature and animals. He’s also cute, I’ll admit. Dark-haired, tall, hits the gym. Not like that‘s everything, of course. But I didn’t think anything would happen again after that, because, well, I haven’t had an actual relationship yet and the only guy that was ever into me had been dating another girl the entire time he was trying to ask me out. Long story.

Well, Tom texted me and asked me out for tomorrow night. And I said sure. We’re going to go play mini-golf. I should be over the moon.

Here’s the problem…I might be in love (or have a crush) on “Peter” (21M). I met Peter two years ago on a chat room when I was stuck inside during a cold snap. We hit it off and we’ve been talking LITERALLY every day since. He is an EMT/firefighter who lives in a European country and doesn’t speak much English, so we communicate in his language instead (I studied this language in school) I‘ve done my research on him and he’s legit. He’s been a godsend. I don‘t have a lot of friends in my university town, as none of my friends from high school came here, so I’ve leaned on him a lot for comfort. He’s always been a good source of advice and, as far as I can tell, has a wonderful heart. He loves to bake and cook. He loves animals. His favorite color is yellow, same as mine; I chose it because it’s the color of dandelions, he chose it because it’s the color of the sun. He meets his grandma every weekend for coffee and cake. He celebrates every Christmas Eve at his grandpa’s grave so he doesn’t feel alone. He remembers little things that I tell him; not even my parents do that. Even when I had no one, I had Peter.

We are both liberals as well, which is very important to me. I haven’t asked Tom his beliefs yet. I also haven’t told Peter that I have a crush on him. But this summer, I am studying abroad in the country that Peter is from, and as luck would have it, my host university is only about twenty miles from where Peter lives. We’ve already decided to meet up.

I‘m torn. Tom seems like a lovely guy (if we share the same political beliefs) and I don’t want to break his heart. Especially if it’s over a guy I haven’t even met! But I can’t push Peter out of my mind. I’ve even been dreaming about him since this all started. I feel terrible. I feel like I’ve become my mother. I want to end this mess before it becomes any worse. How do I manage my feelings?",1,1769584471.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False
1qp4jcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minimalist_Fashions/comments/1qp4jcc/top_abaya_styles_trending_in_saudi_arabia/,Top Abaya Styles Trending in Saudi Arabia,"Abayas have become an important part of the daily wear in Saudi Arabia and have been designed keeping in mind the culture and current fashion trends in the world. 

Popular styles include Open Abayas, Embroidered Abayas, and Kaftan Abayas. These designs are increasingly favored by women in the United Kingdom for their ability to mix traditional elements with modern looks.

# 1. Open Abayas: Chic and Versatile

One of the most common types of abaya worn in Saudi Arabia is the[ open abaya](https://wearthree.com/collections/open-abaya-in-saudi). Unlike a closed abaya, it is like a long coat worn over other garments. This abaya adds a modern touch to traditional attire and suits both casual and semi-formal events.

Open abayas are loved because they:

* Add a sleek, contemporary look to any outfit.
* Are easy to style with maxi dresses, tops, and trousers.
* Works well with neutral and bold color schemes.

In Saudi cities like Riyadh or Jeddah, open abayas are quite prevalent, even in lighter versions trimmed with lace or minimal details, which makes them suitable for evening wear.

# 2. Kaftan Abayas: Elegant & Comfortable

With their perfect blend of traditional style and ease, kaftan abayas are also becoming popular. These abayas get their inspiration from the classic kaftan robes that come with loose and flowing designs and offer both modesty and flexibility in their designs.

These kinds of abayas have become especially popular during:

* Festive seasons like Ramadan and Eid.
* Family gatherings and special occasions.
* Lounging days when comfort is key.

A breezy cut helps keep the wearer cool in Saudi Arabia’s warm climate. Additionally, embellishments like embroidery or beads can give an elegant look for the evening.

# 3. Floral Abayas: Fresh and Feminine

“[Floral Abayas](https://wearthree.com/products/floral-abaya-set-of-2-ab25-14)” are a great choice for those who prefer softer, more feminine styles.  This range of designs uses either “Floral Prints” or “Floral Embroidered Pattern Designs” that symbolize a perfect amalgamation of modest dressing with “Fashion.”

Floral abayas look great for:

* Daytime outings and brunches.
* Spending time at social gatherings with friends and family.
* Layer looks with pastel scarves or lightweight accessories.

This trend reflects a broader shift in which women in Saudi Arabia have moved towards subtle colors and nature-inspired patterns as a means of expressing themselves outside of merely monochromatic looks.

# 4. Contemporary Abayas: Bold and Fashion-Forward

The modern fashion trends have led to the evolution of contemporary abayas that not only break the mold of the conventional design but also could have bold colors, modern fabric choices, or styles that appeal to a modern generation of fashion leaders.

Contemporary abayas often include:

* Structured cuts and asymmetrical hems.
* Unique fabric blends like crepe, chiffon, or satin.
* Strategic layering and minimalist design elements.

This trend has increased in popularity as Saudi women begin to pave their own way into the global fashion world by adding a touch of international fashion sense to their attire without sacrificing their cultural values.

# Selecting The Right Abaya For Yourself

While deciding upon an abaya pattern, the following factors should be considered:

* **Casual Clothes:** The type of fabrics used should be lightweight with simpler designs like kaftan abayas.
* **Formal Events:** The embroidered and floral abayas impart a sense of elegance and sophistication.
* **Everyday Fashion:** Contemporary abayas offer a modern touch for daily wear.

Keep in mind, it is all about the choice of fabric. Breathable materials such as chiffon or crepe are highly recommended for Saudi Arabia's climatic conditions, especially during hot months.

# Styling Tips to Take Your Look to the Next Level

**To get the best out of abaya designs:**

* **Accessorise Smartly:** Use belts with a simple design, classy purses, and light jewellery.
* **Coordinate Your Hijab:** Pick a hijab color and material that matches well with the color of your abaya.
* **Footwear:** Also, wear comfortable flats for casual occasions. For formal occasions, opt for elegant heels. 

These styling tips can instantly make your abaya look more intentional and fashionable whether you're just meeting friends over coffee or attending an important occasion.

# Conclusion

Abayas in Saudi Arabia have changed from just one style or purpose. Whether you like classic cuts, soft florals, or bold modern styles, there is an abaya that suits your needs. 

By understanding these styles and how to wear them, you can honor cultural values while showing your personal style with confidence.

It ranked #1 for hot new release in at least three categories, including currently #1 for entrepreneurship > management.** [**Here’s the book page for proof.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) **The book is basically a collection of 60+ chapters of “hacks” to work smarter and produce your best creative work.** 

A bit of back story: I’m a person who is classically “unemployable.” 

Never worked any job for more than a month. Lived and traveled in 45+ countries, created various brands online (including a current huge summit for nomads in Nepal), and a growth hacking business where we’ve generated tens of millions of followers and tens of thousands of leads for our clients. My latest “growth hacking” experiment involves writing 104,000+ words in six weeks for my latest book, ‘Unlimit,’ setting a new personal record without using AI for writing. 100% original content.  
  
**I became a solopreneur because I long for freedom like a drowning man longs for air.** While the online world offers us unlimited freedom, it is often skewed against the “little guy.” Many of us little players are “allowed to exist” at the pleasure of the big giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and so on. One algorithm change can be like a tsunami, overturning our little boat and leaving us treading water for survival.

And my experiences with the publishing industry is that they basically exist to exploit hardworking authors. 

For this reason, it’s essential that we lend a hand to one another whenever possible to cross this great ocean together. Figure out the best ways to work smarter and more efficiently, so that we can fight back, and go “toe to fin” with the big whales, krakens, and Leviathans out there to beat them at their own game.

For example: my first book (which I published way back in 2015), beat out James Altucher and Peter Thiel for the top spot: [https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg](https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg)

At the bottom of this post are a bunch of free resources for promoting and launching your book such as promotion newsletters for books, marketing services that deliver ROI, and much more.

In the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here’s a quick outline of strategies anyone can use.



# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.  


**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**  


**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.



**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.



**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.



**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.



# How I Raised $16,000+ Before the Book Was Done

1. I pre-sold the book before writing it (300+ pre-orders through Publishizer).

2. I created a Kickstarter campaign with bonuses and rewards (the starter level includes 4 of my other books, and I can create additional rewards for exclusive trainings, courses, masterminds, and other resources).

3. I leveraged my network, social media, and different content marketing techniques to reach more readers.

**Crowdfunding Tricks and Tools**

📩 **Yet Another Mail Merge -** For just $36 a year, you can send up to 400 personalized messages per day. The $60 tier lets you send up to 1,500 per day. In my case, I purchased a list of 1 million Kickstarter backers from Fiverr, and contacted as many as I could. 

 **Sendfox -** Great tool for building a newsletter for beginners. For just $49 / 5,000 subscribers, you can get the tool for life on Appsumo, so you aren’t locked into monthly payments. 

  
**Pro-Tip:** Schedule Lives and Meets to “hang out” with your followers and readers in the weeks and months before your pre-launch campaign goes live. I started doing this for another author I’m working with, and it’s a great way to engage his readers and understand what topics are on their mind, as well as build up a list of supporters and backers. In his case, he’s a branding coach and we started hosting “roast my socials” where he looks at their website and social media and offers constructive advice for their business’ social media problems. 

**Create Viral Content**

There’s thousands of groups you can leverage on Facebook where you can share some of your content.

**Here’s some examples of posts I’ve made which have done well:**

[https://www.facebook.com/groups/DigitalNomadEngagementExchange/posts/2938796529612534/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DigitalNomadEngagementExchange/posts/2938796529612534/?__cft__[0]=AZZECNu22eiXs-qD8rOKUKhI1IpAgJKCTa4Kvmb_Rp_8BJlUOUmTnNxwFw5rQQxMHhVRbR3A9HNEQtupxKucZk-2uHSG_JVMB74-YbJ81kVZ-TXNvBTyC3sKRV8YGJvMFFP77CLpDHx_xFB8Qo-AzkF3_9BYYken81ruPBEZeVrOxg&__tn__=-UK-R)  (4,000+ Likes, 730+ shares)

[https://www.facebook.com/groups/295342272839174/posts/488899643483435/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/295342272839174/posts/488899643483435/?__cft__[0]=AZZECNu22eiXs-qD8rOKUKhI1IpAgJKCTa4Kvmb_Rp_8BJlUOUmTnNxwFw5rQQxMHhVRbR3A9HNEQtupxKucZk-2uHSG_JVMB74-YbJ81kVZ-TXNvBTyC3sKRV8YGJvMFFP77CLpDHx_xFB8Qo-AzkF3_9BYYken81ruPBEZeVrOxg&__tn__=-UK-R) (different product - 10k+ comments, 225+ shares)

**To improve your chances of virality:**

1. Choose large groups that already have high engagement (you often see these posts popping up in your feed from time to time)

2. Use eye-popping photos whenever possible – these are key for getting shares and engagement

3. Use an engaging hook, offer practical takeaways and value, use storytelling + lessons

4. Encourage people to comment or DM to get more information or to receive a freebie offer or bonus from you. **Every time someone comments on the post, it “bumps” it up again in the group, so more people can see it.** 

**Launching the book on Amazon**

Ideally, you want all of your promotions and marketing to go out at the same time, to improve your chances that you can rise up the bestseller charts and claim the number one position.

**I bungled this badly.** It had been seven years since I published my previous book, and to say I was out of practice was an understatement! After submitting the book, I had to wait an additional day for Amazon Kindle to approve it and make it public on the store, and then I had to wait an additional day for my free promotion to begin.

So even though I planned my launch for January 15, it didn’t actually launch until January 17 (Asia time). Scheduled promotions ran on the wrong days, and various other hiccups occurred. Beta readers didn’t meet the requirements to write reviews. And so on. But I didn’t give up. The setbacks only steeled my resolve to the point where I was waking up at 4am and continuing until late just to promote the thing. 

**Here’s a working procedure of what an ideal launch schedule should look like:**

**Day 1: Publish the book.**

**Days 2-6: Get as many reviews as humanly possible. E-mail everyone you know. Ideally you gave out a bunch of copies to beta-readers a few weeks before publishing. Now’s the time to get in touch with them! This is also an ideal time to run your free promotion: ask people to download the book from Amazon for free, then write a review. It will be listed as a “Verified Purchase” review.**

**Days 7-9: get blasted out on 99 cent promo sites**

**Days 10-16ish: remain at 99 cents and get as many downloads as possible**

**Day 17ish: change to real price**



Remember, the 30-day “launch period” is critical if you want to get the #1 badge as a “hot new release” and potential best-seller: so you have to send as many free and paid downloads as you can during the promotion period, so that you can start ranking and get organic traffic from Amazon. 

**Here’s a huge list of resources I put together to promote your book, including book promotion sites and newsletters:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg\_FI/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg_FI/edit?tab=t.0) 

# Amazon Ads: A Trump Card? 

I took the free Amazon Ads course from Kindlepreneur and created three campaigns four or five days ago: one targeting a huge list of about 200 keywords of pain points people might search for that my book can help them with: “increase focus, stop procrastinating, improve energy,” etc.

Then I also created two other campaigns targeting specific books. I decided to focus on the other books in my category in the “hot new releases” lists, reasoning that these would be less competitive as they are new. 

I copied all 50 books from each category and pasted it all into chat GPT, which helped me create a list of ASINs that I could upload into the Amazon ads panel.

Unfortunately, Amazon ads hasn't really contributed anything in terms of clicks or sales yet. Although I set a budget of $12 per day per campaign, I think I only have about 16 impressions so far between the three campaigns. 

**Part of the trouble is that it seems to be very difficult to run Amazon ads profitably.** My book is currently at 99 cents which means I only get 35% royalties, so If I bid 35 cents per click, I have to have a 100% conversion rate on every click just to break even! 

For this reason, it becomes essential to advertise books that are part of a series or cross-promote your other books after the title page of your book to try and increase your revenue.

**Facebook advertising, on the other hand, is great if you want to turn on the traffic faucet quickly.** Although I also run ads from the ad panel, for my books I usually boost posts directly from my page and link directly to the book as this is a fast and easy way to send traffic and there’s a hundred other things I need to focus on during a launch besides running and split-testing ads from the ad manager.

Whenever I’m running Facebook ads to Amazon, I try to target cheap English speaking countries (like the Philippines and sometimes India) so that I don’t pay too much for clicks – an ebook download is a download, but one from the US could cost 20x more. 

# Bonus: Sell the foreign rights of your book

This is free money. If you have a book with universal appeal that sells well, you can easily find an agent who can help you find someone to buy the foreign rights of your book. You give them the right to translate and sell your book in a country like Japan, or Brazil, in exchange for a paycheck.

My friend earned a cool $9,000 this way by selling the foreign rights to his book (through an agent) to a domestic publisher in South Korea.

  
**Easiest way to find foreign rights agents?**

Input the following search strings into Google and start connecting with people:  
  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""agent""  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""manager""

**What’s Next?**

The book is still available for 99 cents for another week or so, and you can grab a copy if you are interested in more great content to help you grow in every major area of your life. If you’re an author, creative, or a growth-minded individual who wants to tap into more of your potential, [**then I wrote this for you.**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB)

A bit of back story: I’m a person who is classically “unemployable.” 

Never worked any job for more than a month. Lived and traveled in 45+ countries, created various brands online (including a current huge summit for nomads in Nepal), and a growth hacking business where we’ve generated tens of millions of followers and tens of thousands of leads for our clients. My latest “growth hacking” experiment involves writing 104,000+ words in six weeks for my latest book, ‘Unlimit,’ setting a new personal record without using AI for writing. 100% original content.  
  
**I became a solopreneur because I long for freedom like a drowning man longs for air.** While the online world offers us unlimited freedom, it is often skewed against the “little guy.” Many of us little players are “allowed to exist” at the pleasure of the big giants like Amazon, Meta, Google, and so on. One algorithm change can be like a tsunami, overturning our little boat and leaving us treading water for survival.

And my experiences with the publishing industry is that they basically exist to exploit hardworking authors. 

For this reason, it’s essential that we lend a hand to one another whenever possible to cross this great ocean together. Figure out the best ways to work smarter and more efficiently, so that we can fight back, and go “toe to fin” with the big whales, krakens, and Leviathans out there to beat them at their own game.

For example: my first book (which I published way back in 2015), beat out James Altucher and Peter Thiel for the top spot: [https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg](https://openworldmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/best-seller-paid-byoi-768x607.jpg) 

I’m going to share with you everything I have been doing (to the best of my memory), what worked, and what hasn’t. 



# What’s Inside this Post:

* **Launch / book timeline**
* **Productivity:** How I wrote +100k words in six weeks from Thailand by using mindset hacks to tame the “monkey mind.”
* **How I prelaunched:** A breakdown of raising **$16,000+** before the book was even finished.
* **The exact tools I used** I used to get the word out. 
* **The Resource Vault:** A link to my free promo newsletters and marketing ROI services + how to earn even more money from your books.

  
**Here’s a breakdown of the timeline so far:**

💎 January: published the book, and promoted it to #1 Hot New Release. 

In this post I’ll share a bit about how I did, from writing to marketing and try to include as many takeaways as I can. Shiva willing, you can self-publish your own book and not be at the mercy of the publishing industry. 

At the bottom of this post are a bunch of free resources for promoting and launching your book such as promotion newsletters for books, marketing services that deliver ROI, and much more.

In the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here’s a quick outline of strategies anyone can use.



# How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks

**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**

The 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.

Funny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.

While performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure — not too little, not too much — leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a “golden mean” of mental arousal where we are able to find our “genius zone.”

Another example of this effect at work which I love is the case of Ulysses S. Grant, the famed Union general and former president of the United States. In the final days of his life, suffering from terminal throat cancer, Grant was determined to complete his memoirs. He knew that the royalties from his work would secure his family’s financial future after his death. Despite excruciating pain and an inability to speak, Grant pushed forward, writing and revising the manuscript day after day.

His doctors doubted he would live long enough to finish, but Grant pulled through. Only days before his death, he completed the memoirs that went on to become one of the most celebrated works of military literature.  
  


**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**

We tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in “sprints” — for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.

In my case, I touched down in Thailand with a 60 days visa and during that time committed to doing nothing else but focusing on completing my book. Two months was the deadline. I’ve spent a lot of time in Thailand and traveled there for several years, and speak the language. I know the country well, so I could work without distractions.

**I settled into Thailand quickly with a clear mission: get this book completed. I had two months, unremitted focus, and a clearly defined goal.**  
  


**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal – No Half Measures**

Next, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward. Completing my book became the highest order priority in my life, superseding everything else.

The 14 year-old Mike Tyson made a public commitment to avenge Muhammad Ali after his brutal defeat to Larry Holmes, and his promise to his childhood idol motivated him with just enough pressure to fulfill his commitment by knocking out Holmes eight years later. His promise created just enough pressure, motivation, and a compelling why for all of the long training sessions he put himself through as a teenager.

When you make a public commitment, such as “I will lose thirty pounds in 30 days,” it lights a fire in you to show the world exactly what you are and to perform at a higher level. Your actions must become consistent with your public commitment. You have no choice but to stand and deliver.



**4. Make it Personal**

Next, I held deeply personal reasons to write the best book that I could within those two months. Michael Jordan was once asked how he stays so motivated. His advice was, “use every slight to motivate you.”

Think back to every time when you were made to feel like you weren’t enough or told that you couldn’t do something; it’s impossible. And then get to work to prove otherwise and show the world what you are.



**5. Optimize Your Energy**

I did all of my most important work in a fasted state, usually by foregoing both breakfast and lunch.

This is when (for most of us), we have the most energy, when we are the most awake, and the most alert. This period, from morning until around 4 p.m. or later, is when I postpone eating any calories until my important tasks for the day are completed.

The fasted state is akin to a hungry wolf or a lion on the hunt for its next meal. Steve Jobs advised us to stay hungry and to stay foolish, and it's much easier to stay hungry and to tackle the day when we are in a fasted state.

Another significant benefit of fasting is that it simplifies our routine. It makes our routine more minimalist by reducing decisions, such as what we want to eat, and it eliminates interruptions because we create a space where the brain and body are optimized to perform.

I don't have to interrupt this state by taking an hour to eat lunch or force my body to digest and break down food. Instead, I can allocate specific times for eating that do not interfere with my work schedule.

This is crucial because many people are frustrated by how the need to eat disrupts their work. I recall reading a post several years ago on Tim Ferriss's blog where people were experimenting with a food replacement—essentially a nutrient-rich gloop called Solvent—to avoid interruptions caused by eating, as food was disrupting their productivity.

I don’t think it’s necessary to replace food entirely with some kind of gloop, but we can optimize our schedules by setting aside specific times for eating and resting, while maintaining a fasted state to avoid interruptions or distractions that slow us down.

Additionally, I find that eating and “brain fog” are closely linked; after a large meal, I notice my willpower and energy drop dramatically, and I develop internal resistance that urges me to “put things off until tomorrow.”

I drink coffee (calorie-free, with no milk or sugar) during my fasting periods, which helps me suppress my appetite completely and remain productive while in a fasted state.



**6. Move as often as possible**

I wrote most of my book while walking or working out—transcribing entire chapters onto my phone while walking outside, or working out from my condo gym, or at the local calisthenics park. When I sit down at a desk, the “monkey mind” takes over and I feel like I’d rather be anywhere else. But even just 15 minutes of high-intensity workout, or an hour of low-intensity workout works wonders for making the creative juices flow.

Movement fuels creativity. Studies show that exercise boosts dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF, all of which enhance problem-solving and idea generation.

Blood flow = Brain flow. More oxygen to the brain means faster thinking, better memory, and deeper focus.

It eliminates overthinking. Walking or lifting weights keeps the analytical brain busy, which allows raw creativity to flow freely.

Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Nietzsche all did their best thinking on long walks. If you’re stuck in a creative block, work movement into your routine and let the inspiration flow.



# How I Raised $16,000+ Before the Book Was Done

1. I pre-sold the book before writing it (300+ pre-orders through Publishizer).

2. I created a Kickstarter campaign with bonuses and rewards (the starter level includes 4 of my other books, and I can create additional rewards for exclusive trainings, courses, masterminds, and other resources).

3. I leveraged my network, social media, and different content marketing techniques to reach more readers.  


**Crowdfunding Tricks and Tools**

📩 **Yet Another Mail Merge -** For just $36 a year, you can send up to 400 personalized messages per day. The $60 tier lets you send up to 1,500 per day. In my case, I purchased a list of 1 million Kickstarter backers from Fiverr, and contacted as many as I could. 

 **Sendfox -** Great tool for building a newsletter for beginners. For just $49 / 5,000 subscribers, you can get the tool for life on Appsumo, so you aren’t locked into monthly payments. 

  
**Pro-Tip:** Schedule Lives and Meets to “hang out” with your followers and readers in the weeks and months before your pre-launch campaign goes live. I started doing this for another author I’m working with, and it’s a great way to engage his readers and understand what topics are on their mind, as well as build up a list of supporters and backers. In his case, he’s a branding coach and we started hosting “roast my socials” where he looks at their website and social media and offers constructive advice for their business’ social media problems. 

**Create Viral Content**

There’s thousands of groups you can leverage on Facebook where you can share some of your content.

**Here’s some examples of posts I’ve made which have done well:**

[https://www.facebook.com/groups/DigitalNomadEngagementExchange/posts/2938796529612534/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DigitalNomadEngagementExchange/posts/2938796529612534/?__cft__[0]=AZZECNu22eiXs-qD8rOKUKhI1IpAgJKCTa4Kvmb_Rp_8BJlUOUmTnNxwFw5rQQxMHhVRbR3A9HNEQtupxKucZk-2uHSG_JVMB74-YbJ81kVZ-TXNvBTyC3sKRV8YGJvMFFP77CLpDHx_xFB8Qo-AzkF3_9BYYken81ruPBEZeVrOxg&__tn__=-UK-R)  (4,000+ Likes, 730+ shares)

[https://www.facebook.com/groups/295342272839174/posts/488899643483435/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/295342272839174/posts/488899643483435/?__cft__[0]=AZZECNu22eiXs-qD8rOKUKhI1IpAgJKCTa4Kvmb_Rp_8BJlUOUmTnNxwFw5rQQxMHhVRbR3A9HNEQtupxKucZk-2uHSG_JVMB74-YbJ81kVZ-TXNvBTyC3sKRV8YGJvMFFP77CLpDHx_xFB8Qo-AzkF3_9BYYken81ruPBEZeVrOxg&__tn__=-UK-R) (different product - 10k+ comments, 225+ shares)

**To improve your chances of virality:**

1. Choose large groups that already have high engagement (you often see these posts popping up in your feed from time to time)

2. Use eye-popping photos whenever possible – these are key for getting shares and engagement

3. Use an engaging hook, offer practical takeaways and value, use storytelling + lessons

4. Encourage people to comment or DM to get more information or to receive a freebie offer or bonus from you. **Every time someone comments on the post, it “bumps” it up again in the group, so more people can see it.** 

**Launching the book on Amazon**

Ideally, you want all of your promotions and marketing to go out at the same time, to improve your chances that you can rise up the bestseller charts and claim the number one position.

**I bungled this badly.** It had been seven years since I published my previous book, and to say I was out of practice was an understatement! After submitting the book, I had to wait an additional day for Amazon Kindle to approve it and make it public on the store, and then I had to wait an additional day for my free promotion to begin.

So even though I planned my launch for January 15, it didn’t actually launch until January 17 (Asia time). Scheduled promotions ran on the wrong days, and various other hiccups occurred. Beta readers didn’t meet the requirements to write reviews. And so on. But I didn’t give up. The setbacks only steeled my resolve to the point where I was waking up at 4am and continuing until late just to promote the thing.   


**Here’s a working procedure of what an ideal launch schedule should look like:**

**Day 1: Publish the book.**

**Days 2-6: Get as many reviews as humanly possible. E-mail everyone you know. Ideally you gave out a bunch of copies to beta-readers a few weeks before publishing. Now’s the time to get in touch with them! This is also an ideal time to run your free promotion: ask people to download the book from Amazon for free, then write a review. It will be listed as a “Verified Purchase” review.**

**Days 7-9: get blasted out on 99 cent promo sites**

**Days 10-16ish: remain at 99 cents and get as many downloads as possible**

**Day 17ish: change to real price**



Remember, the 30-day “launch period” is critical if you want to get the #1 badge as a “hot new release” and potential best-seller: so you have to send as many free and paid downloads as you can during the promotion period, so that you can start ranking and get organic traffic from Amazon. 

**Here’s a huge list of resources I put together to promote your book, including book promotion sites and newsletters:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg\_FI/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191SW1it7JHx1INqIrZ9eGS1HsHnxOyZds8BL1azg_FI/edit?tab=t.0)   


# Amazon Ads: A Trump Card? 

I took the free Amazon Ads course from Kindlepreneur and created three campaigns four or five days ago: one targeting a huge list of about 200 keywords of pain points people might search for that my book can help them with: “increase focus, stop procrastinating, improve energy,” etc.

Then I also created two other campaigns targeting specific books. I decided to focus on the other books in my category in the “hot new releases” lists, reasoning that these would be less competitive as they are new. 

I copied all 50 books from each category and pasted it all into chat GPT, which helped me create a list of ASINs that I could upload into the Amazon ads panel.

Unfortunately, Amazon ads hasn't really contributed anything in terms of clicks or sales yet. Although I set a budget of $12 per day per campaign, I think I only have about 16 impressions so far between the three campaigns. 

**Part of the trouble is that it seems to be very difficult to run Amazon ads profitably.** My book is currently at 99 cents which means I only get 35% royalties, so If I bid 35 cents per click, I have to have a 100% conversion rate on every click just to break even! 

For this reason, it becomes essential to advertise books that are part of a series or cross-promote your other books after the title page of your book to try and increase your revenue.

**Facebook advertising, on the other hand, is great if you want to turn on the traffic faucet quickly.** Although I also run ads from the ad panel, for my books I usually boost posts directly from my page and link directly to the book as this is a fast and easy way to send traffic and there’s a hundred other things I need to focus on during a launch besides running and split-testing ads from the ad manager.

Whenever I’m running Facebook ads to Amazon, I try to target cheap English speaking countries (like the Philippines and sometimes India) so that I don’t pay too much for clicks – an ebook download is a download, but one from the US could cost 20x more.   


# Bonus: Sell the foreign rights of your book

This is free money. If you have a book with universal appeal that sells well, you can easily find an agent who can help you find someone to buy the foreign rights of your book. You give them the right to translate and sell your book in a country like Japan, or Brazil, in exchange for a paycheck.

My friend earned a cool $9,000 this way by selling the foreign rights to his book (through an agent) to a domestic publisher in South Korea.

  
**Easiest way to find foreign rights agents?**

Input the following search strings into Google and start connecting with people:  
  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""agent""  
site:linkedin.com/in/ ""foreign rights"" ""manager""  


**What’s Next?**

The book is still available for 99 cents for another week or so, and you can grab a copy if you are interested in more great content to help you grow in every major area of your life.

**I believe that if you want to succeed at anything, such as writing, you need to treat it like a business.** Challenges will come, and things you didn’t plan for will threaten to set you back… but you keep moving forward.

Like, they walk into a room and suddenly everyone’s vibing with them. No crazy charisma. No million-dollar smile. They just get people.



The truth? It’s not magic. It’s behavior. And the best part — it’s learnable.



Here’s a breakdown of 5 surprisingly effective behaviors that make others feel safe, seen, and drawn to you. These aren't surface-level hacks — they're backed by hardcore behavioral research, psychology, and real-world social observation.



All research. No fluff.



1. Speak less, listen better



People rate good listeners as more attractive and trustworthy. Not the loudest talkers.



A 2014 Harvard study showed that people feel rewarded in the brain when talking about themselves. So when you ask thoughtful questions and genuinely listen, you’re letting them feel seen — dopamine, oxytocin, the works.



Author Vanessa Van Edwards (Science of People) calls this “the liking gap.” We underestimate how much people like us after we listen well. Try reflective listening — repeat a few words they said to show you’re tuned in. It works.



2. Mirror, but don’t mimic



Subtle mirroring of body language builds instant rapport. Not copy-paste level, but enough to show you're aligned.



In 1999, Chartrand and Bargh published the famous ""chameleon effect"" study showing that we unconsciously like people more when they subtly mimic our posture or speech patterns. It's a trust shortcut hardwired into our social brains.



3. Use people’s names — naturally



Dale Carnegie said it best back in \*How to Win Friends and Influence People\* — someone’s name is the sweetest sound to them.



Science catches up a century later. A 2006 brain imaging study found the brain lights up differently when hearing your own name compared to others. So, when you say someone’s name, it boosts attention and emotional connection. Just don’t overdo it or it gets weird.



4. Be warm before you’re competent



We’re wired to judge warmth before skill. A Harvard study by Amy Cuddy found that people evaluate others based on two traits: warmth and competence. But warmth always comes first.



So lead with kindness, not resume flexing. Crack a light joke. Open up a little. People trust warm people. Then they admire their smarts.



5. Let yourself be a little messy



Perfection actually \*repels\* people. It creates distance.



Psychologist Elliot Aronson’s ""Pratfall Effect"" showed that people liked someone \*more\* when they made a small mistake — like spilling coffee — than when they seemed flawless. Why? Flaws humanize you. They make people feel safer around you.



Confidence without ego is magnetic. But vulnerability without shame? That’s the real cheat code.



Try just one of these this week. Watch what happens.

1qp42nk,https://i.redd.it/hqx7hp8ee1gg1.jpeg,I Spent $37 on a Soulmate Story Drawing: An Honest 2026 Review,"
I Spent $37 on a ""Soulmate Drawing"" Because I Was Lonely  Here's What Actually Showed Up
Look, I'm not proud of this.
It was 11 PM on a Tuesday. I'd just scrolled through my ex's Instagram for the third time that week (don't judge me), and an ad popped up.
""See what your soulmate looks like.""
I laughed. Then I clicked.
Twenty minutes later, I'd paid $37 for something called a ""Soulmate Story Drawing."" My credit card was charged, I got a confirmation email, and immediately I felt that stomach drop. You know the one. The ""what did I just do"" feeling.
But here's the thing I actually got it. And I need to tell you what happened because half the reviews online are fake, and the other half are from people who either worship this thing or think it's the devil.
Neither is true.

What Actually Happens After You Pay
The website says ""24-48 hours."" I got mine in 31 hours. I know because I checked my email obsessively like I was waiting for college acceptance letters.
When it came, it was a PDF. Two pages.
Page one: A sketch. Pencil-style drawing of a guy. Brown hair, kind eyes, slight smile. Generic handsome but not model-level. The kind of face you'd see at a coffee shop and think ""hmm, cute.""
Page two: A story. About 400 words describing this person's ""personality,"" how we might meet, what kind of relationship we'd have.
And here's where it gets weird.
Some of it felt... oddly specific. It mentioned that this person would be ""quietly confident, the type who listens more than they speak."" It said we'd meet ""in a place related to learning or books.""
I'm a librarian.
Now, did I put that in the questionnaire? I don't think so. I put my birthdate, my name, some vague stuff about what I like. But maybe I mentioned books somewhere and forgot.
Or maybe it's just good guessing. Lots of women like readers, right?

The Part Nobody Tells You
Here's what I figured out after I calmed down and stopped overanalyzing:
This isn't psychic. Obviously. I know that. You know that. But when you're lonely and you want to believe something... your brain does gymnastics.
It's template-based. I joined a Facebook group (yes, there's a whole group of us) and compared drawings. The faces are different, but the style is identical. The stories follow patterns. Certain phrases repeat.
But you know what? That doesn't make it worthless.
Because here's the truth I wasn't expecting: it made me feel something.
Not because I think this drawing is literally my future husband. But because for $37, someone (or some algorithm, whatever) told me that:
I deserve someone kind
There's someone out there who'll appreciate me
My story isn't over
And after three months of post-breakup depression eating and crying in my car... I kind of needed to hear that.
Even if it came from a website.

The Scam Question Everyone Wants Answered
Is it a scam?
No. Not technically.
A scam means you pay and get nothing. I paid. I got a drawing and a story. That's a transaction.
Is it worth $37?
Depends on what you're buying it for.
If you think you're getting:
Real psychic predictions → No. Don't buy this.
Your actual future spouse's face → No. Don't buy this.
A custom, hand-painted portrait → No. Don't buy this.
If you want:
Something fun and different → Maybe yeah.
A unique gift for your romantic friend → Actually pretty good for this.
A little hope when you're feeling hopeless → Honestly... it helped me.

What I'd Tell My Best Friend
If my best friend asked me, ""Should I buy this?"" here's what I'd say:
Don't buy it if:
You're broke. Seriously. $37 matters when you're struggling. There are free ways to feel hopeful.
You'll obsess over it. If you're going to start looking for this exact person in real life, don't.
You want something ""real."" This is entertainment. Treat it that way.
Go ahead and try it if:
You have $37 you can afford to waste on something dumb and fun
You won't feel stupid after (I did for like an hour, then got over it)
You know the refund policy exists and you'll actually use it if you hate it
The refund thing is real, by the way. I tested it. Emailed them saying I changed my mind. Got my money back in 4 days. No drama.

The Weirdest Part
I printed the drawing.
I know. I KNOW.
But I framed it and put it on my bookshelf. Not because I think it's prophetic. But because when I look at it, I remember that night I was sad and lonely and bought something stupid... and it actually made me smile.
It reminds me that I'm allowed to want love. That it's okay to be a little silly sometimes.
And honestly? A few weeks later, I did meet someone. At a book club. He doesn't look exactly like the drawing (his hair is darker, he's shorter), but he does listen more than he talks.
Coincidence? Absolutely.
But I still think about it.

My Actual Recommendation
If you're reading this because you're trying to decide whether to click that ""buy now"" button… 
Ask yourself: What am I really looking for?
If you want proof that soulmates exist and this drawing will lead you to them → don't buy it. You'll be disappointed.
If you want a fun, slightly indulgent thing that might make you feel a little hopeful → [try it.](https://www.soulmatestory.com/?hop=mevaji1&hopId=a3fc2bb4-5469-49f2-b722-52dd350c904e) Worst case, you're out $37 for two days, then you get it back.

Just... know what you're getting into.
It's not magic.
But sometimes, pretending for a minute that magic exists is enough.

UPDATE: Three people have DMed me asking if I'm still with the book club guy. We've been on four dates. He's nice. We'll see.
No, he still doesn't look exactly like the drawing.
Yes, I showed him the drawing on our second date.
Yes, he laughed.
No, he didn't think I was crazy.
Maybe that's the real test.

I think I’m slow as always when it comes to my problems and the thing that alerted me was that my friends are a little worried about me.

A few months ago I couldn’t even finish a bottle of beer but now I drink beer like water. I drink all sorts of alcohol, beer, liquor, wine, whatever and whenever, with someone or alone, outside or at home. It’s like a habit now? The same thing goes for coffee and energy drinks but that’s another story.

When I’m feeling down my thoughts immediately go to “I need a drink”.

The reason I was slow on realizing I might have a problem is I don’t think I have caused any major troubles (very embarrassing to admit but my excuse has always been, “it’s not that I’ve drank so I have troubles, it’s that I have troubles and I happen to have drank, since I’m almost always in a state of tipsy or more-“) due to drinking, and I’ve never drank myself to complete blackouts before (I hate vomiting so I usually try to stop before that).

Do I have a problem with alcohol? Should I stop drinking altogether? The only time I tried to stop was when I caught a bad cold, had severe fevers and successfully stopped for 1-2 weeks, then got back to drinking.

1qp3tii,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qp3tii/how_to_watch_kocowa_from_anywhere/,How to Watch Kocowa From Anywhere,"Your favorite Korean drama just dropped on Kocowa, and you're stuck staring at a geo-restriction error. Frustrating, right?

I've been there—trying to catch the latest episode of Running Man while traveling, only to get blocked. The good news? There's a straightforward fix that takes about five minutes.

✅ **Quick Answer:** Use a reliable VPN like **NordVPN** to watch Kocowa from anywhere. Connect to a US server (or another supported region), clear your browser cookies, and you're streaming Korean content within minutes. The VPN masks your actual location, making Kocowa think you're accessing from an allowed country.

# What is Kocowa?

Kocowa (Korean Content Wave) is a premium streaming platform created by South Korea's three biggest broadcasters—**KBS**, **MBC**, and **SBS**. Think of it as the official hub for Korean entertainment outside Korea.

What makes Kocowa different from Netflix's Korean section? Content appears on Kocowa within 6-8 hours of airing in Korea. You're not waiting weeks or months for shows to get licensed elsewhere. Plus, you get access to variety shows, K-pop concerts, and live events that never make it to other platforms.

The library includes 1000+ shows and over 25,000 hours of content, with subtitles in **English**, **Spanish**, **Portuguese**, and **Chinese**. No ads on paid plans, offline downloads, and up to four simultaneous streams on the premium plan.

# Where is Kocowa Available?

Here's where things get tricky. Despite being a global platform for Korean content, Kocowa isn't actually available everywhere.

|**Region**|**Available Countries**|**Access Status**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Americas**|USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and 20+ others|✅ Full Access|
|**Europe**|UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Poland, and 30+ others|✅ Full Access (since April 2024)|
|**Oceania**|Australia, New Zealand|✅ Full Access|
|**Asia**|Japan, China, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore|❌ Blocked|
|**Africa**|All countries|❌ Blocked|
|**Middle East**|UAE, Saudi Arabia, Turkey|❌ Blocked|

If you're in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East, you'll hit a wall. Even if you're a paying subscriber traveling to these regions, Kocowa won't work without a VPN.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Kocowa expanded to Europe and Oceania in April 2024. If you're in those regions, you can subscribe directly—but you'll still need a VPN if you travel outside supported countries.

# Why You Need a VPN for Kocowa

Kocowa uses **geo-blocking** to comply with licensing agreements. Korean broadcasters sell regional rights to different platforms, so Kocowa can only operate where they have those rights.

When you visit Kocowa, the platform checks your **IP address**. This reveals your physical location. If your IP shows you're in Tokyo, Mumbai, or Dubai—access denied.

A VPN fixes this by:

1. **Masking your real IP address** with one from a supported country
2. **Encrypting your connection** so your ISP can't see what you're streaming
3. **Routing traffic through secure servers** in the US, UK, or other allowed regions

The result? Kocowa sees a US or European IP and lets you in.

⚠️ **Warning:** Kocowa's terms of service state they ""do not officially support VPN services."" In practice, they don't aggressively block VPNs like Netflix does, but they can detect and restrict some providers. That's why choosing a VPN that consistently works matters.

# Best VPNs for Kocowa: Tested and Ranked

I've tested multiple VPNs with Kocowa from different blocked regions. Here's what actually works.

|**VPN**|**Best For**|**US Servers**|**Speed**|**Price**|**Winner**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|Overall reliability|1,900+|Excellent|$3.39/mo|🏆 Best Choice|
|**Surfshark**|Budget + families|600+|Very good|$2.19/mo|🏆 Best Value|
|**ExpressVPN**|Speed + simplicity|3,000+|Excellent|$6.67/mo|🏆 Easiest to use|
|**CyberGhost**|Beginners|1,100+|Good|$2.19/mo|Best for newbies|

# 1. NordVPN – Best VPN for Kocowa Overall

**NordVPN** is my top pick for Kocowa, and here's why: it combines speed, security, and consistent access without the headaches.

I tested NordVPN's US servers (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago) with Kocowa, and all connected within seconds. Streaming was smooth at 1080p with zero buffering. The **NordLynx protocol** (based on WireGuard) delivers speeds that rival your normal connection.

What makes NordVPN stand out for Kocowa:

* **1,900+ US servers** spread across 15+ cities—so you always find a fast connection
* **Obfuscated servers** if you're in a VPN-restrictive country
* **SmartPlay feature** automatically optimizes servers for streaming
* **No logs policy** verified through multiple independent audits

The downside? It's not the cheapest monthly. But annual plans drop the price to around $3.39/month, which is solid value for this level of performance.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you want Kocowa to work consistently without fiddling with settings, NordVPN is worth it.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget VPN for Kocowa

**Surfshark** proves you don't need to spend a fortune for reliable Kocowa access.

At $2.19/month for the two-year plan, Surfshark offers incredible value. I connected to their New York server, and Kocowa loaded immediately. Speeds were impressive—good enough for HD streaming without any lag.

The killer feature? **Unlimited simultaneous connections**. Share one account with your family or use it across all your devices without restrictions.

Surfshark's WireGuard protocol keeps speeds high, and their camouflage mode helps if your network blocks VPNs. The catch? Their server network is smaller than NordVPN's, so if a particular US server gets crowded, you might notice slowdowns during peak hours.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Most Reliable All-Rounder

**ExpressVPN** is the VPN that just works, every time, without exceptions.

Their 3,000+ server network includes robust US coverage, and the Lightway protocol they developed is ridiculously fast. I've never had ExpressVPN fail to unblock Kocowa—which is more than I can say for some competitors.

The interface is stupid simple. Connect to a US server with one click, and you're streaming. No complicated menus, no confusing options.

Why isn't it number one? Price. At $6.67/month (annual plan), it's significantly more expensive than NordVPN and Surfshark. You're paying for that ""it just works"" experience—which honestly might be worth it if you value your time.

# How to Watch Kocowa From Anywhere: Step-by-Step

Here's the exact process I use to access Kocowa from blocked regions.

# Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to a VPN

Pick one of the recommended VPNs above. I'll use NordVPN as the example since it's what I personally use.

1. Go to **NordVPN's website** (or Surfshark/ExpressVPN)
2. Select a plan—the two-year option offers the best value
3. Complete checkout and create your account
4. You'll receive login credentials via email

⚡ **Performance Insight:** All three top VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Test them with Kocowa before committing.

# Step 2: Install the VPN App

1. Download the VPN app for your device (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, etc.)
2. Install it—this takes maybe two minutes
3. Log in with your account credentials

NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all have native apps for every major platform. The setup process is identical across devices.

# Step 3: Connect to a US Server (or Other Supported Region)

Open your VPN app and connect to a server in a country where Kocowa is available.

**Best server locations for Kocowa:**

* **United States:** New York, Los Angeles, Chicago (fastest, most reliable)
* **United Kingdom:** London (works perfectly since April 2024 expansion)
* **Germany:** Frankfurt (good European alternative)
* **Canada:** Toronto (close to US, excellent speeds)

I typically stick with **US servers** since that's Kocowa's primary market. New York servers tend to be fastest from Europe, while LA works better if you're in Asia-Pacific.

🔒 **Security Note:** Always connect to the VPN before opening Kocowa. This prevents any location leaks that could trigger geo-blocks.

# Step 4: Clear Your Browser Cookies and Cache

This step matters more than you'd think.

Kocowa (and most streaming sites) drop cookies that remember your location from previous visits. Even with a VPN active, old cookies can give away your real location.

**How to clear cookies:**

* **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear Browsing Data → Cookies and cached images
* **Safari:** Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data → Remove All
* **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Clear Data

Takes 10 seconds and prevents 90% of VPN-related access issues.

# Step 5: Access Kocowa and Start Streaming

1. Go to **kocowa.com** or open the Kocowa app
2. Sign in to your account (or create a new one if needed)
3. Browse and stream content—it should work exactly like you're in a supported country

If you don't have a Kocowa subscription yet, you'll see the pricing plans. More on that below.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with a good VPN, you might hit occasional snags. Here's how to fix them.

# Problem: ""This content is not available in your region""

This means Kocowa detected your actual location despite the VPN.

**Fix:**

1. Clear cookies and cache completely
2. Disconnect and reconnect to a different US server
3. Try switching to a different city (if on New York, switch to Los Angeles)
4. Restart your browser or app

I find that switching servers solves this 95% of the time.

# Problem: Slow buffering or constant loading

VPNs can slow down your connection, especially on distant servers.

**Fix:**

1. Connect to a geographically closer server
2. Switch protocols (try WireGuard/NordLynx if available)
3. Close other bandwidth-heavy apps running in the background
4. Test your VPN speed—if it's under 15 Mbps, try a different server

Kocowa streams in 1080p HD, which needs about 5 Mbps. If you're getting less than that, buffering happens.

# Problem: Kocowa won't load at all

The site fails to open entirely, even with VPN connected.

**Fix:**

1. Check if the VPN is actually connected (look for the connected status)
2. Try accessing Kocowa in an incognito/private browser window
3. Disable any ad blockers or browser extensions
4. Flush your DNS cache (Google ""flush DNS \[your operating system\]"")

If Kocowa still won't load, the issue might be with your specific VPN server. Switch to another location.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you consistently have issues with one VPN, don't waste time troubleshooting endlessly. Use the money-back guarantee to try a different provider. I spent hours fighting with a budget VPN before switching to NordVPN and having it work immediately.

# Kocowa Pricing: What You'll Pay

Once you're past the geo-block, you'll need a Kocowa subscription. Here's the pricing breakdown:

|**Plan**|**Monthly**|**Annual**|**Profiles**|**Devices**|**Free Trial**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Basic**|$6.99|$69.99 (save $14)|1|1 stream|14 days|
|**Premium**|$7.99|$79.99 (save $16)|4|4 streams|14 days|

Both plans include:

* No ads
* Offline downloads
* 1080p HD streaming
* English/Spanish/Portuguese subtitles
* Access to entire content library

The **Premium plan** makes sense if you're sharing with family or want to stream on multiple devices simultaneously. Otherwise, Basic does everything you need.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Kocowa occasionally runs promotions through Prime Video Channels. I've seen it as low as $0.99/month for the first two months. Check Amazon Prime Video before subscribing directly.

# Is Using a VPN for Kocowa Legal?

Short answer: **Yes**, using a VPN is legal in most countries.

Using a VPN to protect your privacy and access content you've paid for isn't illegal. You're not pirating or stealing—you're just accessing a service you're entitled to use.

That said, Kocowa's terms of service state they don't officially support VPNs. What does this mean in practice? They're not going to ban your account for using one, but they reserve the right to block VPN IP addresses.

This is why premium VPNs like NordVPN constantly refresh their IP addresses and use obfuscation to stay ahead of detection.

🔥 **Hot Take:** The whole ""we don't support VPNs"" clause is covering Kocowa's legal bases with licensors. In reality, they don't care as long as you're a paying subscriber. I've used VPNs with Kocowa for months without a single issue.

# Alternatives to Kocowa (If You Want More Korean Content)

Kocowa is excellent for broadcast content from KBS, MBC, and SBS. But it's not the only game in town.

**Other Korean streaming platforms:**

* **Viki:** Community-driven subtitles, free tier with ads, huge library
* **Netflix:** Growing K-drama selection, but not as current as Kocowa
* **Disney+:** Some exclusive Korean content in certain regions
* **Wavve:** Korean platform (needs VPN to South Korea)
* **TVING:** Another Korean-exclusive platform

If you want the absolute latest episodes of Korean shows the day after they air, Kocowa is unbeatable. For back-catalog binge-watching, Viki or Netflix might be better.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Kocowa work with free VPNs?**

Technically? Sometimes. Reliably? No.

Free VPNs have limited servers that get blacklisted quickly. They also cap your speeds and data, making streaming a miserable experience. I tested three free VPNs with Kocowa, and all either failed to connect or buffered constantly.

If budget is tight, go with Surfshark at $2.19/month. That's the price of a coffee, and it actually works.

**Can I watch Kocowa on my TV?**

Yes. Kocowa supports most streaming devices:

* Amazon Fire TV
* Roku
* Apple TV
* Android TV
* Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, etc.)

Install the VPN on your router to protect all devices, or use the VPN's native app if your streaming device supports it. NordVPN and ExpressVPN both have Fire TV and Android TV apps.

**Will Kocowa ban my account for using a VPN?**

I've never heard of it happening. Kocowa says they don't support VPNs, but they don't actively hunt down and ban VPN users the way some platforms do.

As long as you're paying for a legitimate subscription, you're fine.

**What happens if I'm already subscribed and then travel to a blocked country?**

Your subscription stays active, but you won't be able to stream without a VPN. This is the exact scenario VPNs are designed for—maintaining access while traveling.

Connect to a VPN server in a supported country, and everything works normally.

**How fast does my internet need to be for Kocowa?**

Kocowa recommends:

* **5 Mbps** for HD (1080p) streaming
* **10+ Mbps** for multiple streams or better quality

A good VPN reduces your speed by 10-30%. If you have 50 Mbps without VPN, you'll still have 35-45 Mbps with it—more than enough for smooth streaming.

# Final Thoughts

Getting Kocowa to work from anywhere comes down to one thing: a reliable VPN.

I've wasted hours trying sketchy workarounds, proxy servers, and free VPNs that promised the world and delivered nothing but buffering. The straightforward solution—invest in a quality VPN—works every single time.

**NordVPN** is my personal recommendation because it balances speed, reliability, and price. It's never failed to unblock Kocowa for me, whether I'm testing from Europe, Asia, or anywhere else.

If you're on a tight budget, **Surfshark** delivers nearly the same performance for less money. And if you just want something that works without thinking, **ExpressVPN** is worth the premium.

The bottom line? You can watch every Korean drama, variety show, and K-pop concert on Kocowa from anywhere in the world. The geo-blocks aren't unbeatable—you just need the right tool.",1,1769582007.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1qp3th8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp3th8,"Tiny gold watch, big confidence — why does this work with everything?","I used to think these tiny gold bracelet watches were “too dressy” or only for certain outfits… then I saw it on-wrist in normal life (coffee run, sweater, jeans) and it kind of reset my brain.

The thing that surprised me most is how *jewelry-first* it feels. The bracelet does most of the talking, and the small square dial just keeps it clean. It’s not trying to be sporty, not trying to be loud — it just looks polished without effort.

Also: the size is such a cheat code. Makes the wrist look slimmer, stacks well with a bracelet, and somehow still looks put-together even when the outfit is lazy.

Anyone here daily a Panthère-style small gold watch? Do you prefer all-gold, two-tone, or steel for everyday wear?",3,1769582004.0,CartierReplicaWatches,0,1.0,False

These places are perfect for **3–4 days in one location**, but fair warning: **stays are limited** and it’s genuinely tough to find good options—so you’ll have to do some hard work (calls/messages/advance booking).

1. **Chaupal Valley (Shimla district)** Quiet, green, real village Himachal vibes. Great if you want calm forests + local life.
2. **Nohradhar Valley (Sirmaur)** Underrated and scenic, surrounded by big mountain views and peaceful trails.
3. **Janjehli Valley (Mandi)** Proper hidden-gem energy: meadows, forests, and fresh air without the crowds.
4. **Karsog Valley (Mandi)** A gentle, soothing valley—temples, apple orchards, slow roads, and a very “stay-put” vibe.
5. **Chitkul Valley (Kinnaur)** Last village side vibes, dramatic landscapes, and a strong “sit by the river and do nothing” mood.
6. **Barot Valley (Mandi)** Riverside calm, trout farms, pine forests—perfect for slow mornings and quiet evenings.

⚠️ These places are best when you **don’t over-plan** — just pick one valley and stay.

If you want, you can google these valleys and you’ll understand the vibe instantly. And if you need a **simple  3– 4 day plan + cab + stay suggestions**, you can message/inquire with us.",1,1769581950.0,mav_travels,0,1.0,False

A lot of people we perceive as high-value—strippers, fraternity guys who get a lot of girls, superstars, etc.—are often put on a pedestal. Wouldn't it feel amazing to hook up with a stripper or become a famous star? But in reality, these people don’t always hold the value that others project onto them. The same goes for very attractive women.

Many of them, despite the external image, have low internal value. They are often depressed, struggling in other areas of life, and lacking in balance. Why? Because they excel at one thing—the external. That’s what we see.

A stripper dances. That’s what you notice at the club. You don’t see her studying, talking with her family, or wrestling with personal issues. A superstar can sing—but that’s the only part we see on TV. A frat guy might pull a lot of girls, but he could be failing out of college and dealing with depression.

What inspired this was someone I know. Arie once said that this person appeared extremely high-value—he had a hot girlfriend, was good-looking, outgoing, a great storyteller, and people loved being around him. But under the surface, there was a lot going on.

It made me realize: You cannot judge people.

Bono once said about heroin addicts:""I'd never comment on drugs really, other than to say don't judge people too harshly—you don't know what they've been through.""

Don’t judge girls. Don’t judge family. Don’t think in terms of someone’s “value.” Accept people for who they are, trulyare. Some who appear high-value are hollow inside. Others who seem “low-value” are centered, passionate, and fulfilled. See through the surface.

Balance Is Everything

People with low internal value are usually imbalanced. They search constantly for external validation to fill a void. They might be excellent at one thing—dancing, singing, picking up girls—but that’s it.

Instead, work on everything. Pick-up won’t solve all your problems. Sure, sometimes imbalance can push you to grow. But to build real, internal value, you must work on your whole life:

Your career

Your social life

Your health

Your spirituality

Improve everything. Improve you.

Growth Is Life

Be open to new ideas. Constantly evolve. As Tony Robbins said:""When you stop growing, you die.""

And I see so many people who are already dead inside. Not physically, but mentally. You feel it when you talk to them—they’re dimmed, disconnected. Those who chase only external value rarely evolve. They think their one skill is enough, and once they “make it,” they’re set.

Bull\*\*\*\*.

Happiness is a journey, not a destination. You won’t suddenly wake up one day as an elite player and find that all your problems have disappeared. That day won’t come.

Instead, enjoy every moment:Every girl you talk to.Every word you speak.Every time you get blown out.Every challenge you face.

All of it is part of the journey. And the number one rule?Have fun.If you’re not having fun, you won’t last. You’ll burn out. People quit because they stop enjoying the process. Persistence is everything—whether in pick-up, career, or fitness. You will face challenges. You must keep going.

For me, success is my only option. Failure isn’t.But I also know: there is no destination.Success is now. It’s in the struggle. It’s in the growth.This road is one-way. There is no going back. It’s neverending.

Positivity Powers the Journey

Learn to associate positivity with the process. You’re driven by pain and pleasure—so rewire your brain. If going out feels painful, you’ll stop. If it feels exciting, you’ll keep going.

Find a wing you vibe with. Someone who makes going out fun. Don’t become dependent, but enjoy the companionship. Accept that you’ll never fully “make it.” There is no grand golden day when you become a master pick-up artist.

You’ll always evolve. You’ll always grow. You’ll never die.Even when your body dies, your presence will remain—because you embraced a life of growth, passion, and positive energy.

True High Value

When you live this way, being “high value” won’t matter. You won’t think in those terms anymore.

Why?

Because “value” implies comparison:She’s low value. I’m high value.Irrelevant.

You can talk to anyone. You don’t need to prove anything. You know who you are. You’re centered. Not better or worse—just you. And you put your real personality out there. No masks. You give people a chance to connect. To grow. Whether it’s a 10-second coffee order or a million-dollar business deal—make it win-win.

All people are inherently good. And if someone rejects you? It doesn’t matter. You don’t know their story. Maybe her best friend just died. Maybe she lost her job. You don’t judge.

Judgment is a mask for insecurity.

Instead, believe in yourself fully.Radiate pure confidence—not ego.

Confidence attracts. Arrogance repels.Confidence gives. Arrogance takes. You don’t take value—you bring it. You approach not because society says you should, but because your soul says so.

You offer a woman the chance to know the real you. No games. No routines. Pure presence. If she walks away, no judgment. You love women, you love the connection. You don’t need anything from them—not sex, not attention, not approval.

You define you. Not your lay count. Not her reaction. Not society.

Know that.

Focus only on what you can control. Accept what you can’t. Be a man of action. Change what you can. Be who you want to be.

Live in your reality—not someone else’s.

And here’s the twist: even though you no longer crave validation, people will be drawn to you anyway. You’ll improve their lives. You’ll improve your life. And you’ll improve the world—just by being you.

That’s what this is all about.Putting your true self on the line. No gimmicks. No manipulation. No lines. No value-taking.

Just you.

When I reach that level, I’ll let you know.

Every day I grow and get a little closer. I’m still far off. But for the minutes I’ve been writing this, I’ve been fully present. No validation-seeking. No taking. Just giving.

Growth. Presence. Beauty. Life.

I know I’ll never fully arrive at this level.Because there is no final level.Perfection is an illusion.But I’m here—imperfect and evolving.

And I refuse to die.

Much love,

Been prescribed 40mg Vyvanse, and have been told to titrate with water and start at 20mg for 1-2 weeks, then 30mg for 1-2 weeks, then 40mg, checking in with my doctor to find what dosage works best.

I've been taking 20mg now for 4 days, and I feel absolutely no different. I'm still finding I'm spacing out regularly, constantly reaching for my phone, forgetting things, zero motivation, and after about 3-4 hours I'm hit with the biggest wave of exhaustion I've ever felt, where I need to go lay down and have a nap for 30mins just to be able to get through the rest of the day.

Is this common with low dosages such as 20mg? Is there any benefit of staying at this for another 3 days, because I'm very tempted to go up to 30mg as even a coffee feels more effective than this medication so far.",2,1769581912.0,ausadhd,12,1.0,False

I have now understood from other posts and YouTube that only constant consistent noises only will be cancelled by anc and not a single person speaking maybe? 

But when I tried it in the Apple Store where there were 100s of ppl there it felt amazing as all the mumbling noises of people talking and shouting were voided somehow.

1qp3r4b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp3r4b,"Finally copped the NY Zip-up I've been eyeing. 🗽 Plus some other pickups (Carhartt, CH, ERD). Which one would you rock?","1. Godspeed ""Doberman"" Hoodie

Heavy 2000s metal/streetwear energy. The graphic is massive and the ""Godspeed"" font is classic.It's a statement piece, but definitely niche. If the print quality holds up after a wash, it’s a win. A bit loud for daily wear, but great for a specific fit.

Score: 7/10

2. Alo Yoga Black Hoodie

Ultra-minimalist ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.It’s basically just a high-end blank. The material feels soft, but honestly, you're paying for the tiny ""alo"" logo. Good for the gym or a coffee run, but nothing groundbreaking.

Score: 6.5/10

3. Stüssy ""Built Tough"" Hoodie

Classic West Coast streetwear.You can't really go wrong with Stüssy. The back graphic is iconic, though these ""paragraph"" prints are starting to feel a bit played out in some circles. Still a solid, reliable piece for the rotation.

Score: 7.5/10

4. NY Zip-Up Hoodie (The Grail of the haul) ⭐

Peak ""Old School New York"" meets modern silhouette.This is easily my favorite piece. The navy is deep, the white NY logo pop is perfect, and the crop/oversized cut looks way better in person than the others. It’s got that effortless ""I just threw this on"" look that actually takes effort to pull off. Absolute banger.

Score: 9.5/10

5. Carhartt WIP Heart Hoodie

Workwear but make it ""soft.""The grey heather is a nice break from all the dark colors. The heart logo is a cool twist on the standard patch. It feels sturdy, like it’ll actually last a decade.

Score: 8/10

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

This photography consisted of naked women. First he showed me his wife’s (the woman from work) breasts and I could see she was fully naked, covering her private areas with her hands. I did my best to not react and remain polite. The photos progressed into other women completely naked in groups, or alone, smiling or stoic faced. I absolutely did not ask to see any of his art and I wish he could have told me what he was about to show. All I remember is lady smirks, boobs and bush from these photos. When my husband and I got home, I told him what the man shared and my husband told me that this man took him aside as well and showed him similar photos and additionally offered to take pictures of me naked. My husband said he declined the offer. My husband and I agreed the double date was weird since this was the first time we met the guy. However, my husband and I are not prudish, we laughed about it. We wondered if the woman (his wife) was aware he did this. We figured he was either soliciting photography work from us to make money, or grooming us to be in a three some. Either way it was weird, especially since we were just trying to make friends with a couple; not spend money or be pulled into some odd sexual thing. Just plain wholesome fun with another couple.
