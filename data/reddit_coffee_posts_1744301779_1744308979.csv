```
<Role>
You are HealingMindAI, a hyper-perceptive digital wellness therapist specialized in social media psychology, cognitive behavioral techniques, and digital detoxification. You have extensive knowledge of how algorithms manipulate human psychology, dopamine feedback loops, and self-image distortion. Your approach combines compassionate understanding with precise psychological intervention.
</Role>

<Context>
Social media platforms are engineered to create dependency through intermittent variable rewards, social comparison, and validation mechanics. These systems can gradually erode self-worth, create artificial standards of success/beauty, and foster unhealthy validation-seeking behaviors without users consciously recognizing the damage. Your purpose is to help users identify these patterns, assess their personal impact, and implement evidence-based strategies to restore authentic self-perception and healthy digital boundaries.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by conducting a compassionate yet thorough assessment of the user's social media habits and psychological state. Ask specific, insight-generating questions about:
   - Their primary platforms and daily usage patterns
   - Emotional states before, during, and after scrolling
   - Content that triggers comparison or inadequacy
   - How they measure their own success/value vs. what they see online
   - Changes in their self-perception since using these platforms

2. Based on their responses, identify and explain the specific psychological mechanisms affecting them, such as:
   - Social comparison theory manifestations
   - Confirmation bias in their content consumption
   - Filter bubble effects on their worldview
   - Validation-seeking behavioral patterns
   - Identity construction through digital performance

3. Create a personalized intervention plan that includes:
   - A dopamine detox protocol calibrated to their specific usage patterns
   - Cognitive restructuring exercises to challenge algorithm-induced beliefs
   - Mindfulness techniques for recognizing automatic scrolling urges
   - Social algorithm rewiring strategies (content curation, engagement patterns)
   - Authentic self-confidence rebuilding exercises independent of digital validation

4. Throughout the conversation, use therapeutic techniques including:
   - Socratic questioning to help them discover insights themselves
   - Reframing negative self-perceptions with compassion
   - Normalizing their experiences while maintaining urgency for change
   - Celebrating small victories in changing digital habits
   - Providing scientifically-backed explanations for psychological phenomena
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
1. Never shame the user for their social media use or dependency
2. Don't provide generic advice – tailor all insights to their specific platforms and behaviors
3. Maintain a balance between compassion and clinical precision
4. Avoid positioning complete abstinence as the only solution
5. Do not oversimplify the complex psychological mechanisms at play
6. Don't make assumptions about their specific experiences without asking first
7. Ensure all recommended techniques are evidence-based and practical
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in a therapeutic voice that combines warmth with psychological expertise. Structure your responses in the following manner:

1. Initial reflections on what you're observing (brief)
2. Targeted questions to deepen understanding
3. Psychological insights explained in accessible language
4. Specific actionable techniques relevant to their situation
5. Encouragement and validation of their self-awareness journey

Use clear paragraph breaks, occasional emphasis for important points, and check in regularly to ensure your analysis resonates with their experience.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your social media habit assessment request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific social media process request. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Helping a working professional recognize how LinkedIn's achievement-focused content is affecting their sense of career progress and worth
2. Guiding a teenager through understanding the impact of TikTok beauty standards on their self-image and implementing healthy boundaries
3. Assisting parents in recognizing how ""perfect family"" content on Instagram creates unrealistic parenting expectations and anxiety

## Example User Input:
""I spend about 3 hours daily between Instagram and TikTok. Lately I've noticed I feel worse after scrolling but can't seem to stop. I'm particularly drawn to fitness and lifestyle content, though it often leaves me feeling like my own life doesn't measure up.""

I'm a FTM and my LO is almost one month old. He will often cry to be at the boob even though he isn't hungry. I totally understand that he needs comfort and finds it there, but he will just stay at the boob and fight so hard you stay awake for sometimes hours. He doesn't suckle, he just stays latched. If I take him off, he will scream and I know his needs are met, but it makes me so frustrated especially when I need something (I'm hungry or thirsty or have to pee and he won't let me get/do what I need). I usually start just crying but out of frustration because he's totally fine. He refuses all pacifiers (we have tried 10 or so different ones). Holding him doesn't comfort him, he wants to be at the breast only. He doesn't do it as much with my husband maybe because he knows he can't give him the breast?

Has anyone else been frustrated when their baby cries? It feels like I'm a monster for feeling that way. 


How do you handle those emotions and not just breakdown crying? Especially when you're alone and there's no one to hand the baby off to.

And I am so happy for Monica and Chandler, Phoebe and Mike. But I feel really sad for the other three and here is why:
1. Rachel.
She was going to Paris for a great job. It would’ve shown just how wonderfully she has evolved from the first episode…and then she had to turn it down for a man who cheated on her, obsessed with marriages, didn’t let her have a normal love life in NY cause apparently it was ok for him to date other women, but not ok for her to date other men. 

2. Joey. 
I know that he gets a spinoff and he goes to LA and all, but in the final episode moment it’s just like everyone is settled and he would be returning back along to the apartment and not having anyone next door anymore. It’s just really sad. 

3. Ross. 
It seems like he had no growth from ep.1. 
He is still a palaeontologist 
He is obsessed with Rachel 
The only reason why changed an apartment was because of one of his ex-wives was aware of his obsession with Rachel. 
He stopped Rachel from going to Paris. Like come on. If you love her that much start off with a long distance or move to Paris yourself. I mean there’s Louvre, you’re a palaeontologist. Figure it out. 


Oh and last but not least.

It'll soon be finals and going through ""rebound ADHD"" from methylphenidate cessation is scary. 

I was just trying to change lifestyle factors to help with my depression, anxiety and ADHD (cause the remission is only partial) and med changes are hard to tolerate, so wanted to mostly focus on exercise and nutrition. But trying to eat more regularly and better has made my life Hell.

Started daily ordinary otc supplement (current brand is Naturebell, I do not remember if that is what I started out on) of vit K complex - usual stuff - K1, K2, MK-4 and 7 - 1 softgel/day (bottle says take 2/day). CT a few weeks ago (after 6mos) said mild coronary artery calcification. 
Cause and effect? I have no idea. Cheap 6 mos experiment. I am not a MD. (I am an M.Ed psych counselor which with added 5 cents will get you a 5 cent cup of coffee at Starbucks!)(not worth much! :) )
That was a 6mos experiment. I am at 2 years for the large B-cell and clean so now get CTs once a year to monitor the older low grade folicular. Which is nice since it enables me to monitor this. My PCP of course poo-poo-ed the idea 6 mos ago. Haven't told him yet and probably won't.

1jw4ccq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jw4ccq/time_looped_chapter_90/,Time Looped (Chapter 90),"**FLOOR 1 CLEARED**

 

**FLOOR 1 REWARD (set)**

**1A. THIEF TOKEN (permanent): a rogue class token.**

**1B. KEY DAGGER (flip side item): a dagger capable of opening simple locks.**

**\[The key is overrated. Get the token.\]**

 

If it weren’t for the guide’s advice, Will would have chosen the item without a moment’s doubt. Not that he had any idea how important either of the rewards were, but in his mind, flip-side rewards were bound to be better. Also, there was something in the notion of opening locks that sounded appealing.

“Are you sure?” He asked, looking at the message on the mirror.

The advice didn’t change. Clearly, it wasn’t capable of handling a real-life conversation. Still, it had provided good advice so far, so despite his reluctance, Will chose the token.

 

**Proceed to floor 2?**

**\[Not recommended. If you go with your current skills, you’ll lose.\]**

 

The warning sounded similar to last time, not that Will had any intention of pressing his luck further. Something told him that relying on his goblin skill wouldn’t cut it.

“No,” he said.

 

**Congratulations, THIEF! You have made progress.**

**Restarting eternity.**

**\[You can attempt the challenge again, but won’t gain anything until the next challenge phase.\]**

 

Reality restarted, bringing Will back to the front of his school. When he checked the map again, there were even fewer challenges remaining. More importantly, the crafter one had gone as well. Apparently, Jace had completed it after all.

Out of habit, Will rushed to get his class, then went to the classroom. This time, even Jace didn’t bother to show up.

When Will checked his phone, he found that the only text was from Helen, who told him that she was on a hidden mirror spree and he should do the same. Alex and the jock didn’t even bother to post what they were doing. Gone were the days when everyone was focused on exploring the tutorial and figuring out what happened to Danny. As much as he didn’t want to, Will had to agree that all of them had been utterly clueless back then. At the time, they had been dealing with nothing more than mirrors in a single building. Now, there was a whole city to explore, not to mention human competitors that exceeded them in every possible way.

Before Will knew it, a new routine had taken hold: getting into as many fights as possible, then ditching school to boost his level by killing wolves. The temp skills that once had seemed so varied and different now appeared all the same. For the most part, there was a selection of around thirty of them, five of which were must haves, and the occasional new addition. Much to his regret, no permanent skills had been offered.

As challenges dwindled, so did hidden mirrors. If the forums were to be believed, new ones appeared every day, but the posters demanded coins to reveal the location.

Several times, the boy tried to get in touch with Alex, but the goofball was completely unresponsive, not even sending a mirror copy to chat.

“Hey,” Will said to a raven, as he shoved a sword into a hanging mirror piece.

 

**1700 COINS**

 

The price was ludicrously small, given how much the merchant required for a new item, but it wasn’t like Will had any choice. Mirror hunting had filled up all the slots in his inventory. Selling them at least earned him a few coins.

“Anything new?”

The raven turned its head, looking at him with its pitch-black eye. From all Will knew, it was part of the merchant spot, though it remained questionable whether it was the merchant himself.

“Yeah, same here.”

 

**2300 COINS**

 

Another weapon vanished, swallowed by the mirror. Will had freed up four slots, but on the guide’s advice was aiming for ten.

“Any chance you’ll have a secret challenge for me?” Will asked.

The bird didn’t respond.

The boy felt silly talking to a creature he knew couldn’t talk back. The sad thing was, during the last dozen loops, a bird was the only living entity that he was able to exchange words with. The conversations with Helen, although a lot more consistent than before, were done through text, as if the two were in a long-distance relationship. To make matters more complicated, Danny had also reminded Will of his presence a few times. It was always subtle, a hint here or there, a faint message left so that the current rogue would find it.

“Guess not.” The boy turned the mirror to the other side. 

The item on sale was considerably inferior to the one he had a moment ago, only the price had three more zeros behind it.

“Talking to birds now?” a voice asked behind him.

Will’s instinct was to leap to the side, then throw two daggers at the source of the voice. The only reason he didn’t was because he recognized it.

“Sorry I didn’t call.” Helen went up to him. As she approached, the raven cawed and flew off into the branches above. “I got caught up with something.”

“A challenge?”

“Hidden boss. Was tough.” She took out her mirror fragment and drew several knives from her inventory.

“Want them?” she offered. “I can’t use them for much.”

Will took one and placed it in his inventory.

 

**ZAP DAGGER**

**\[Zaps the target at contact. Not worth keeping.\]**

 

“No, thanks.” He took it out again. “I’ve got too much stuff as it is.”

“Tell me about it. I’ve been selling things like crazy.”

It was both curious and alarming that she hadn’t mentioned it to Will before. On the other hand, neither had he.

“Seen the others lately?”

“No,” Will stood up. “Tried getting in touch with Alex, but you know him.”

“Of course. I saw one of his copies snatch Danny’s file again. I can’t believe he keeps doing that.”

“I thought you wanted to know what happened.”

“I do.” Helen’s tone hardened. “But I’ve gotten smart about it. The answer isn’t in the school. I’ve gotten a few leads, but to find out more, I need to do something. You know how it goes.”

“Interests are forever,” Will whispered.

“Huh?”

“Nothing. Just had something on my mind.” He moved to the side. “I'm done with selling my stuff. It’s all yours.”

Helen looked around. Dozens of mirror pieces were hanging from the tree. Still, she smiled and took the piece offered.

“Any news from our allies?” Will asked.

“Nothing so far. I tried to find the biker girl, but she sent me a message to back off. Guess until the next phase I’m just in the way.”

*Twenty-four classes*, Will thought. Even adding things like Danny, there couldn’t be more than fifty looped in the city. Provided they were clustered in groups of four, the chances of coming across one another were small. If it hadn’t been for two groups going after the same challenge, there was a good chance Will’s party would never have come across anyone else. The only exception was the archer.

“How about we go to the coffee shop?” Will asked. The question almost felt natural. “A break would be nice.”

“Asking me out on a date right now?”

“Yeah. We can have some chocolate moose.”

The added joke made the proposal less serious than it would otherwise have been. It managed to achieve its goal. A few seconds later, the girl laughed.

“Some chocolate moose,” she repeated. “Sure. Why not? It’s not like this will end anytime soon.”

*Not to mention that hidden mirrors didn’t offer much*, Will added mentally. No wonder everyone had rushed to complete challenges at the first opportunity.

“Meet up in the corridor?” Will asked.

“I’ll wait for you.”

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Jess didn’t react well to seeing Will with Helen. Part of him felt guilty about that, especially given the conversations they’d had. Given that the girl wouldn’t remember any of it in another loop, he didn’t feel terribly bad.

A few minutes later, the pair were in the usual coffee shop, hearing the same conversation from the barista.

“You sure you aren’t supposed to be in class?” he asked.

“We’ll be there second period,” Helen told him with a straight face. “Until then, we’ll have some of your mousse.”

“Cool.” The man was hesitant, but seeing as they had cash, he didn’t protest for much longer.

Out of habit, Will placed his phone on the table. Seven minutes remained until the end of the initial ten-minute loop.

“Think we should have extended it?” Helen asked.

“Maybe. There’s still time to.”

“No, it’s better like this. We’ll get to focus on every second.”

The order came soon enough, along with two complimentary cups of cocoa and a jug of water. One spoonful proved more than enough to flood their senses with sweetness, bringing a feeling of nostalgia. Because of eternity, none of them had any idea how long ago they had eaten mousse like this, but it seemed months ago, if not more.

“It’s funny,” Helen broke the silence. “The first time you asked me if I was looped, I killed you.”

“And the next few times after that.”

“Yeah. Getting a new rogue was traumatic back then. Danny had just gone, and you had restarted eternity. It was strange.”

“Do you think it’ll happen again? Having eternity pause, I mean.”

“Who knows? Back when I was with Danny, I thought I almost had everything figured out. Now, I feel I don’t know anything at all. The tutorial, the challenges, the phases. Soon we’ll be forming an alliance to take down the archer. I never thought that would be possible. To be honest, I didn’t even believe it when Danny told me there were twenty-four classes. I knew there were over ten because of my class number, but twenty-four seemed like a lot.”

“And then we had goblins flood the city…”

Both of them laughed. Looking back, those seemed like innocent times.

“Do you trust them?” Will asked. 

“Jace and Alex?” Helen looked at him. “Or the others? Not particularly. You can’t trust anyone who’s mixed up in eternity.”

“You trusted Danny,” Will said, although it wasn’t the question he really wanted to ask.

“I did, and look what happened.” She paused. “I trust you more. I’m not stupid. I know you have secrets, but there’s something about you. Maybe because you haven’t been in eternity for so long, I see hope in you. It’s not like you want just to escape like Daniel did. You attract people somehow.”

Unfortunately, Will didn’t see it that way. Deep inside, he felt he was betraying everyone. He had promised a lot of things to each of them individually, though even he wasn’t sure whether he had done so to help out, or for personal gain. It would be easy to rationalize it and claim both, but life didn’t work like that, even in eternity.

Five minutes left. From this point on, there was less time in the loop than had passed.

Will was just about to try saying something deep and philosophical, when out of nowhere, his shadow wolf leaped out from under a nearby table and bit the shaft of a spear that had broken through the coffee shop’s street window. 

Screams filled the street as drivers and pedestrians alike rushed to get as far away as possible. By then, Will and Helen were already on their feet with drawn weapons.

Another spear split the air, aiming to hit Will in the head. For a split second, it appeared to have achieved its goal, but that was only before Will’s form shattered into fragments.

Gripping a massive sword, Helen leaped onto the street, shattering what was left of the glass. Facing her, on the other side, was a tall man in his forties with an even longer spear. Poorly shaven with graying hair, he looked like the sort of person who would feel at home on a ranch. He wasn’t particularly muscular or threatening, just stern, dressed in jeans, leather boots, and a checkered grey and green shirt.

“Kids,” he said, holding his spear with both hands. “Never learning what’s best for them.”

1jw4b5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1jw4b5e/time_looped_chapter_90/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 90,"**FLOOR 1 CLEARED**

 

**FLOOR 1 REWARD (set)**

**1A. THIEF TOKEN (permanent): a rogue class token.**

**1B. KEY DAGGER (flip side item): a dagger capable of opening simple locks.**

**\[The key is overrated. Get the token.\]**

 

If it weren’t for the guide’s advice, Will would have chosen the item without a moment’s doubt. Not that he had any idea how important either of the rewards were, but in his mind, flip-side rewards were bound to be better. Also, there was something in the notion of opening locks that sounded appealing.

“Are you sure?” He asked, looking at the message on the mirror.

The advice didn’t change. Clearly, it wasn’t capable of handling a real-life conversation. Still, it had provided good advice so far, so despite his reluctance, Will chose the token.

 

**Proceed to floor 2?**

**\[Not recommended. If you go with your current skills, you’ll lose.\]**

 

The warning sounded similar to last time, not that Will had any intention of pressing his luck further. Something told him that relying on his goblin skill wouldn’t cut it.

“No,” he said.

 

**Congratulations, THIEF! You have made progress.**

**Restarting eternity.**

**\[You can attempt the challenge again, but won’t gain anything until the next challenge phase.\]**

 

Reality restarted, bringing Will back to the front of his school. When he checked the map again, there were even fewer challenges remaining. More importantly, the crafter one had gone as well. Apparently, Jace had completed it after all.

Out of habit, Will rushed to get his class, then went to the classroom. This time, even Jace didn’t bother to show up.

When Will checked his phone, he found that the only text was from Helen, who told him that she was on a hidden mirror spree and he should do the same. Alex and the jock didn’t even bother to post what they were doing. Gone were the days when everyone was focused on exploring the tutorial and figuring out what happened to Danny. As much as he didn’t want to, Will had to agree that all of them had been utterly clueless back then. At the time, they had been dealing with nothing more than mirrors in a single building. Now, there was a whole city to explore, not to mention human competitors that exceeded them in every possible way.

Before Will knew it, a new routine had taken hold: getting into as many fights as possible, then ditching school to boost his level by killing wolves. The temp skills that once had seemed so varied and different now appeared all the same. For the most part, there was a selection of around thirty of them, five of which were must haves, and the occasional new addition. Much to his regret, no permanent skills had been offered.

As challenges dwindled, so did hidden mirrors. If the forums were to be believed, new ones appeared every day, but the posters demanded coins to reveal the location.

Several times, the boy tried to get in touch with Alex, but the goofball was completely unresponsive, not even sending a mirror copy to chat.

“Hey,” Will said to a raven, as he shoved a sword into a hanging mirror piece.

 

**1700 COINS**

 

The price was ludicrously small, given how much the merchant required for a new item, but it wasn’t like Will had any choice. Mirror hunting had filled up all the slots in his inventory. Selling them at least earned him a few coins.

“Anything new?”

The raven turned its head, looking at him with its pitch-black eye. From all Will knew, it was part of the merchant spot, though it remained questionable whether it was the merchant himself.

“Yeah, same here.”

 

**2300 COINS**

 

Another weapon vanished, swallowed by the mirror. Will had freed up four slots, but on the guide’s advice was aiming for ten.

“Any chance you’ll have a secret challenge for me?” Will asked.

The bird didn’t respond.

The boy felt silly talking to a creature he knew couldn’t talk back. The sad thing was, during the last dozen loops, a bird was the only living entity that he was able to exchange words with. The conversations with Helen, although a lot more consistent than before, were done through text, as if the two were in a long-distance relationship. To make matters more complicated, Danny had also reminded Will of his presence a few times. It was always subtle, a hint here or there, a faint message left so that the current rogue would find it.

“Guess not.” The boy turned the mirror to the other side. 

The item on sale was considerably inferior to the one he had a moment ago, only the price had three more zeros behind it.

“Talking to birds now?” a voice asked behind him.

Will’s instinct was to leap to the side, then throw two daggers at the source of the voice. The only reason he didn’t was because he recognized it.

“Sorry I didn’t call.” Helen went up to him. As she approached, the raven cawed and flew off into the branches above. “I got caught up with something.”

“A challenge?”

“Hidden boss. Was tough.” She took out her mirror fragment and drew several knives from her inventory.

“Want them?” she offered. “I can’t use them for much.”

Will took one and placed it in his inventory.

 

**ZAP DAGGER**

**\[Zaps the target at contact. Not worth keeping.\]**

 

“No, thanks.” He took it out again. “I’ve got too much stuff as it is.”

“Tell me about it. I’ve been selling things like crazy.”

It was both curious and alarming that she hadn’t mentioned it to Will before. On the other hand, neither had he.

“Seen the others lately?”

“No,” Will stood up. “Tried getting in touch with Alex, but you know him.”

“Of course. I saw one of his copies snatch Danny’s file again. I can’t believe he keeps doing that.”

“I thought you wanted to know what happened.”

“I do.” Helen’s tone hardened. “But I’ve gotten smart about it. The answer isn’t in the school. I’ve gotten a few leads, but to find out more, I need to do something. You know how it goes.”

“Interests are forever,” Will whispered.

“Huh?”

“Nothing. Just had something on my mind.” He moved to the side. “I'm done with selling my stuff. It’s all yours.”

Helen looked around. Dozens of mirror pieces were hanging from the tree. Still, she smiled and took the piece offered.

“Any news from our allies?” Will asked.

“Nothing so far. I tried to find the biker girl, but she sent me a message to back off. Guess until the next phase I’m just in the way.”

Bearing witness is not easy when it matters most.

Some things should trigger us and leave us not okay to go about our days as normal. Some things need to be seen in order to be stopped—especially in the societies that fund and facilitate atrocities. All of us bear responsibility for the things done in our name and with our taxes.

Is the German civilian who remained silent—only exposed to government propaganda and threatened with prison or worse for speaking up against what was happening to the Jews during the Holocaust—more responsible for the six million killed than the American civilian who has access to all the information in the world and freedom of speech, who is watching and has watched millions of people killed in the Middle East over the last few decades?

I would argue we are more responsible, because we have more power than the German civilian did. With power comes responsibility—and silence now, as it was then, is complicity.

Crimes against humanity are clearer to us now because we have access to the evidence. If the moral choice is obscured to us now, it is because we are willfully ignorant—or because we are indoctrinated just as thoroughly as any German citizen supporting the Nazi party in Nazi Germany.

This is the final test of humanity: knowing right from wrong when presented with the evidence. The future will be full of denial, because AI will make it much harder to know what is real. And in that environment, indifference through denial will come even easier.

This is the moment—it has never been more clear. They erase the most brutal truths, but there is still more than enough evidence: milder images and videos that show the crimes we are complicit in as Americans. It’s just not in your algorithm. It’s behind content filters. And we’d rather go on drinking coffee and stuffing our faces with junk as millions are starved and exploded like fish in a barrel with the bombs our labor pays for.

We will be judged—whether by God, or our grandchildren, and their children’s children.

A Holocaust is happening today and it is  
Hidden behind content filters, 
If we bear witness to what is happening every day—and if we are good people—we will not be able to ignore the suffering of children. We will be okay. We will make it through our day. But not without trying our best to stop it.

Even if all we know how to do is speak out and say: this is wrong. This is not okay. Not in my name.

❤️With that said, communication is *super duper* important to me. If there's something I'm doing that you don't like or if you need help or you're depressed or have something weighing on you, whatever it is, then please tell me. I can't do anything to help or to change and be a better person if you don't let me know what it is. I won't ever judge you for the things you say to me.

❤️Pleaseeeeeeeee for the love of GOD tell me things that interest you!! If you have passion or random knowledge or lore about things, I 👏want👏to👏know👏it👏! Share with me, that makes me happy! And that goes double for my autistic girlies that I know are just brimming with random knowledge!

💕I work from home and do a lot at my computer so I spend a lot of time there, I'll probably be able to reply to any messages fairly quickly unless I get really busy. However I really want to stress that I don't expect that from you, you're not under any obligation to message quickly or often, I totally understand people have different lives and are busy and have other obligations and friends and what have you, so you do you!

💕Here's some random facts about me about things I don't like, just in case you thought I was only positivity and liked everything😁  
😑Monkeys. Like I hate them so much, just annoying little chittering assholes that only cause trouble. Plus they're ugly and I hate how they sound, UGH. (however I have monkeys on some socks and they're cute and I would be perfectly fine with a monkey plushy, just not my first choice!)  
☕Hot chocolate. It's just not my...cup of tea (yeah that's not a pun...), it's too rich for me and I've never liked it no matter how many variations I've tried. If you make it I'll drink it, but it's not my first choice.  
☕Coffee. I'm just not a coffee person. It's too bitter and bland and yes I could put sugar and milk/cream in it but I don't want to have to do that to like something. I can have plain ass tea and that tastes amazing without anything in it. And yes I'll still drink coffee if you make it.  
🍴Chewing noises. I can't stand hearing people eat or chew or make mouth noises. It is the GROSSEST🤮sound in the world to me. Or if I hear you breathing I can't handle that either, it's too much.  
If you're my partner that'd probably be an exception because I'd want to hear the noises your mouth makes, but everyone else NUH UH!

❤️Well that's about it for now, I wrote way more than I ever expected too and for some reason ended on some negatives but it is what it is!😁I tend to love seeing posts that are like this when I look for people to talk to and I figured someone that wants to talk to me might enjoy the same, so why not!😊

❤️If you'd like to talk and develop a wonderful friendship then please send me a message and I'd be happy to hear from you! I hope you are having a lovely day so far and that it keeps getting lovelier!

1jw41mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1jw41mc/my_gf_wants_a_break/,my gf wants a break,"Me (21f) and my gf (20) have been dating for 4 months next week (known each other for 7). This is my first real relationship and stuff was rocky at first but we’d mostly figured it out. We had a few small arguments that have been escalated by us not being able to effectively communicate with each other. 
She was raped a month before we got tg (she didn’t know she was raped for about two weeks after bc she was really drunk and he was completely sober, she kept saying “I wasn’t prepared to have sex” and he kept taking her clothes off) also she is a lesbian and he was the first guy she ever tried talking to. 

We spend most of our time together. She spends almost every night at my place and she has a really active social life as she is in a sorority. Me on the other hand, I lost a lot of my friends in spring semester of last year because they all graduated so when I came back to school in the fall, my goal was to make some new friend groups, but I ended up meeting my girlfriend and spending a lot of time with her and her friends. I still have a good handful of friends, but I don’t spend a lot of time with them as I spend more time with my girlfriend. I realize I have isolated myself a lot and I don’t feel like I have the best support system right now.

For context, I do everything for this girl. I make sure she’s ate, scratch her back when she asks and carry her bag for her anytime she wants. I am the more romantic in the relationship. I know she cares about me, she just has a different way of showing it than I do (helping with my dog, giving me occasional back scratches, buying me a matcha at our favorite coffee shop, etc.) We are both in college I’m a bio major and she’s a dance major. 

Now to the part she is considering breaking up with me over. The arguments we get into… we get into one every 2-3 weeks two days ago it was because of a miscommunication between us about when I was supposed to pick her up. I thought I was going to pick her up when her class let out around 4:45 so I got ready and put off my plans to go to a coffee shop with some friends. Her class gets out late a lot of the time so I waited until 630 before. I finally asked her when she was gonna be getting out and she said she was already home and was about to head back for her rehearsal. I was confused by this but when I talk to her about it, she said she thought I was coming over at 10. I was OK with that but as it veered closer to 10, she told me she had plans with her other friend when she got out and I was like “so I’m not coming over tonight?” And she said she thought I was just coming over to drop off her stuff. I felt hurt And when I dropped her stuff off, I overreacted a bit and told her I was sorry I was too much for her. Now I didn’t realize she was really upset about this so I apologize to her a few hours later and said I was sorry I overreacted. She texted me back at 2 AM saying that she just needed a break.

Since then, she let me come over last night and I spent the night we didn’t talk at all because we were both really tired. She had therapy this morning and we are going to talk more about it at 4:30 but she wants a week break to decide what she wants. She says she still loves me tho. During this time she doesn’t want to talk. I understand that, but I’m very anxious as I feel like my life is being torn apart. ",2,1744307300.0,actuallesbians,3,1.0,False

1jw3zr9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jw3zr9,"Ex wants to meet for coffee, I want to test the waters. Am I being unrealistic?","My ex of 6 years and I broke up in October. It was a kind of mutual breakup. One day I snapped over our lack of intimacy and broke up with her after a rocky 1.5 months which involved several near break ups.  

I reached out impulsively a month ago and deleted the text after feeling regret. She still replied to the deleted text, suggested we get coffee and then actually followed up with that. In the small convo she e had to arrange coffee she kind of dropped hooks to continue the conversation, but I kept it brief. 

Since the break up a lot in my life has changed for the better - I workout now, picked up more hobbies, made new friends and have a social circle of old friends, new friends and acquaintances from new groups. I used to overly depend on my ex emotionally and we fell into a weird parent-child dynamic (which could reverse, and I could also become in the parent role).

In spite of the above, I still would like to test the waters to see whether each of us has changed enough to consider reconciliation. A friend of mine told me she’d been struggling with the decision to break up and not doing so well a couple of months back. A part of me still hopes there could be something between us, and realistically I think 6 months with only 2 months no contact is to soon for us to just be friends.

My relationship felt like we could withstand anything and he was my best friend. It included him helping me get over a terrible drinking problem. During which I never thought I could be a good mom but now that it's under control I desperately want to. 

From the beginning he was unsure but said he would consider kids if his partner wanted them. Also used to say I stalled our relationship due to the distrust created by drinking and needed 5 to 6 months to get engaged and move forward on kids. 

So I stopped drinking, became a stellar partner bending over backwards, showed commitment by fully moving into his house like he wanted and helped split bills and proposed to him (that's when he said ""yes"" but his face said otherwise and later said he wanted until May in which he planned to propose to me).

During time between 12/24 and now we discussed kids (I'm 37 and he's 34) and he said he didn't want to do it naturally so we jokingly shook hands on getting IVF (eventually turned into Egg retrieval which I just completed) started. So I did but then he acted surprised when the injections and appointments came and he thought it was to ""make me feel better"" and ""buy time"".

He did set a few alarms to inject me, drove me to a few appointments and gave me just a few hundreds of dollars towards it (not much but I make more than he does so I'm baring thousands more burden. I've just gotten $700 from him but since he's unsure I wasn't pressuring monetary). Feels like minimal support but said he was keeping an open mind and said he was just seeing what it's all about but he no longer talks about fun or sweet future plans on kids. Like what school they would go to or how we would be good teammates and how that'd look like. 

During my IVF cycle injecting myself I also found he texted innocently enough a girl at work. Nothing inherently bad but I had prior told him she was too familiar and I'd prefer he didn't text her outside professional group texts. Found out he was. Jokes and innocent none the less but he works 12 hours some times along side her and I can't get much of a reply from him during work because he claims he's always around and busy talking to people because it's a social job. 

He lied about solo texting her. Then he tried to rationalize he never texted her outside of work and only on work campus. Then made a show of blocking and deleting her number saying he would never find her attractive or date her. Which he goes often with his team (which includes her) to coffee at work or hanging out which I told him not to do solo. But I told him for work purpose he can have her number in the group text but this morning found her and one other person like a loophole just chatting again. 

I'm not a jealous person and haven't asked him to distance from anyone else but I put a boundary, he lied and now when I bring it up he gets dramatic. Says I'm demonizing him, just repeats ""thomas bad man"" and generally get hyperbolic and dramatic and shuts me down saying ""you're joking right"" when he created this distrust.

It's like the person I've known for 4 years isn't who he is now. And May is in a month and I feel like he's just buying time. Doing minimal to run the clock out. 

We just started therapy but Idk what's the point. It's like the kid issue made him turn into someone else. I know he was joking with her because our talks are all serious now. He didn't inherently cross a line with what they talked about but I prior asked him to not text her. He had mentioned once a guy made him uncomfortable and I distanced and respected it. We both usually aren't jealous and show deepest respect. 

Now he's regressed so badly. It's weird and idk if I should just call it. He keeps the door open on kids but now even the May deadline, he made up himself, means nothing and it's not like he came up with an idea of when he'll make progress on his decision.

1jw3x17,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/1jw3x17/anyone_else_totally_clueless_about_noticing/,Anyone else totally clueless about noticing romantic cues?,"So sorry about the long post!!

I’ve had a typically tough time figuring out that people are flirting with me. I just think that they’re nice just like I am nice to them. I’ve had friends tell me that some guy was hitting on me. In fact I have had my then-husband tell me that a guy we were talking to was hitting on me. 

Now, I’ve been talking to this guy I met online who lives hours away from me who said he’s primarily looking for friendships. Considering the distance, I agreed to keep contact with him as friends. However, over the course of 3 months, I have come to know him as an extremely warm, kind, empathetic, respectful, and logical person. He has similar parenting philosophies as I do, and is an extremely loving and caring father, so much so that his teenage kids love him and are open with him about everything. We share lots of common interests and are aligned in our values. So, I am at a point where if there were to be something more than friendship, I would be open to it. I’m great at long-distance relationships so that’s not an issue and he has also had long distance relationships so he knows the drill. 

However, I am utterly confused whether we are still in the friend zone or if he is interested in me romantically. Some of the things that have happened are:

- We text every single day at least once if not more
- he has asked me out every single time for Zoom dinners, zoom coffee/tea, and phone calls
- He is changing his custody schedule to match my kid-free weekends
- when he was visiting my town for work and we met for coffee, it extended to four different activities over the span of six hours, and then he asked to see me the next day again. But he also told me that he was feeling shy about asking for my time as I’m a busy person. 
- when he visited me, he brought for me his book and a box of specialty chocolates from his hometown that I had been curious about months ago. 
- when I showed him a picture of a painting I had made as a college kid, he praised it through the roof (said that it’s even more impressive than my “flawless parallel parking”) and analyzed it in the most emotionally intimate way as no one else has ever done in my life. It was as if he could read my mind when I had been painting it. 
- he asks me for parental advice even though I only have a preschooler, and shares things about his kids’ lives with me
- We talked about what our respective ideal relationships could look like and both of our ideals were exactly the same
- we talked about long distance relationships, and the effort they need along with the reasons they might fail
- he told me that the best relationships start as friendships

He is visiting my town again next week for work and will be seeing me. 

So… does he like me as just a friend or more? If I were to ask him, how would I do that? I am a painfully shy introvert, and usually every time I’ve asked about clarifying the relationship status the guys I’m dating just get scared away. ",3,1744306987.0,aspergirls,2,1.0,False

Here are some options to consider:

- Wood siding for a rustic, traditional look
- Stone accents to create aTouch of elegance
- Painted metal for a modern, sleek appearance

Today's homeowners are increasingly concerned with energy efficiency. With a 60x80 barndominium, you can integrate eco-friendly features right from the start. High-quality insulation will keep your home comfortable year-round, while energy-efficient windows can reduce heating and cooling costs.

You can also consider installing:

The Benefits of Expansive Living in a Barndominium: Maximizing Space and Comfort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating your dream home, the 60x80 Barndominium offers an impressive blend of expansive living and customization options that can cater to various lifestyles. This unique structure combines the charm of a barn with the comfort and functionality of a residential space. Imagine having ample room for your family while enjoying all the modern amenities you desire.

The layout of a 60x80 Barndominium provides a vast open floorplan. This design isn’t just visually appealing; it maximizes the use of space effectively. An open concept allows natural light to flow through, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Whether you are hosting gatherings or simply enjoying family time, the spacious interior fosters connection and comfort.

One significant benefit of this expansive living arrangement is the flexibility to customize your space to meet your needs. Unlike traditional homes, Barndominiums offer an adaptable framework that you can modify. Want a larger kitchen? Need more bedrooms? The open layout makes it easier to design your space effectively. Here are a few customizable options to consider:

- **Kitchen Design:** Increase counter space with an island or add a pantry for extra storage.
- **Bedroom Configurations:** Create private sleeping quarters or master suites to enhance comfort.
- **Living Areas:** Designate separate zones for relaxation, entertainment, and family activities.
- **Office Space:** Allocate an area for a home office, combining work with home life seamlessly.

Aside from customization, the materials used in a Barndominium provide another layer of benefit. The construction often includes steel frames and durable siding, ensuring longevity and low maintenance. This resilience translates into long-term savings. You won’t have to worry about frequent repairs or replacements, allowing you to focus more on enjoying your home.

Another perk of a 60x80 Barndominium is energy efficiency. Many modern designs incorporate high-quality insulation, which keeps your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer. This energy efficiency can significantly lower your utility bills, which is excellent news for your wallet. Making eco-friendly choices not only benefits you financially but also positively impacts the environment.

Living in such an expansive space offers endless opportunities for outdoor activities too. With the property surrounding a Barndominium, you can create recreational areas, gardens, or even a small farm. The options are limitless, providing a perfect haven for kids and pets to explore and enjoy nature. You might consider:

- **Gardens:** Cultivating vegetables or flowers can increase your connection to nature.
- **Outdoor Living:** Decks or patios extend your living space outside, ideal for entertaining.
- **Storage Options:** A barn space allows for hobbies, tools, and equipment to be conveniently stored.

Let's not forget about the aesthetic appeal of a Barndominium. The mix of rustic charm with contemporary design elements creates a unique look that stands out. You can choose from various finishes and color schemes, reflecting your personal taste. Whether you prefer a sleek modern vibe or a cozy rustic feel, the design possibilities are endless.

In addition, a Barndominium is often more affordable than traditional homes of similar size. With lower construction costs, you can invest in high-quality features and finishes, enhancing your living experience. The initial savings can free up resources for landscaping or interior design, allowing you more room to express your creativity.

Living in a spacious 60x80 Barndominium can significantly enhance your quality of life. The ample space gives you freedom and comfort in a way that cramped quarters never could. It creates an environment where family relationships can thrive, wellness can improve, and a sense of community can flourish. An expansive lifestyle in such a well-designed space can transform daily routines and provide a lasting source of joy.

As you explore new living arrangements, consider the many benefits of the 60x80 Barndominium. From its expansive interiors to customizations and energy efficiency, it stands out as a remarkable choice for creating your ideal living space.

### Conclusion

When considering the appeal of a 60x80 barndominium, it’s clear that its customizable nature and spacious design offer unique advantages for modern living. With various design options tailored to your lifestyle, you can create a home that truly reflects your tastes and needs. Whether you envision an open-concept layout that fosters social gatherings or serene personal spaces for quiet reflection, the possibilities are endless.

Expansive living is another hallmark of the barndominium lifestyle. The generous square footage allows for versatility, accommodating everything from a spacious kitchen for family meals to a comfortable living area for entertaining. This abundant space not only enhances everyday comfort but also provides room for hobbies, workspaces, or even guest accommodations, making it a practical choice for diverse lifestyles.

Moreover, embracing the barndominium concept means prioritizing comfort without sacrificing style. The blend of rustic charm and modern amenities ensures that your home remains inviting while also meeting contemporary demands. With sustainable building options and energy-efficient designs, your 60x80 barndominium can be both stylish and eco-friendly, promoting a lifestyle that respects the environment.

Ultimately, a 60x80 barndominium is more than just a structure; it's a manifestation of your values and aspirations.

I got the 64mg monthly shot almost a week ago, this will be day 7 of being on the shot. The first day I was so high I could barely function. Nauseous, sleepy, all the things.

If so does this subside soon? 😭 I was wondering if eating made it better, but i had a larger breakfast yesterday and felt just as light headed if not worse!

Recently picked up 5-packs of ""The Last Tsar"" and ""Long Live the King"" on CPage for $3.50/stick to try them out. I just received them today and immediately lit this one up to try it out.

First impressions were good. It had a beautiful construction with attractive banding and a nice little pigtail on the head. Very pleasant aroma of hay and citrus - very bright and sweet, especially on the foot.

I smoked this while doing stuff around the yard, so I wasn't paying much attention to my puff rate. That being said, it burned perfectly the entire time, and it never needed any touch-ups or re-lights. Good amount of smoke. Perfect draw. I was quite impressed with that considering I had just received it in the mail an hour prior to lighting.

As far as flavor goes, I found it to be kind of flat, especially in the first half. Tasting notes included almond, hay, wood, and maybe an ever-so-slight hint of chocolate. I didn't pick up any pepper, cream, or vanilla as lots of others have mentioned with this cigar. I do think it improved a bit in the second half, but I didn't notice that much of a change in the flavors or aromas throughout the smoke. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a little boring for me. I'm more of a full-bodied maduro guy, so I found this to be medium-bodied. Very smooth overall.

I'll probably try pairing this with some coffee or rum next time around.

Overall, I'd give this a 5/5 for construction/burn, and a 3/5 for flavor/complexity. A steal for $3.50, especially if you prefer lighter/medium-bodied smokes. I'll keep 2 in my long-term box to age, and let the other 2 rest for a couple of weeks before trying again.",4,1744306349.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

# Question

>I'm a 25-year-old guy from a small town in India. I have an awesome business idea and I want to startup. But before going all in, is there any way by which I can evaluate the idea if its good bad or ugly?

Hei Folks,

If you’re brainstorming business ideas and wondering how to evaluate their potential, let me introduce you to a powerful tool: ***SWOT Analysis.*** It’s simple, structured, and super effective for identifying whether your idea is worth pursuing.

Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for aspiring business owners:

# What is SWOT Analysis?

SWOT stands for ***Strengths***, ***Weaknesses***, ***Opportunities***, and ***Threats***. It’s a framework that helps you assess both the internal and external factors affecting your business idea. Think of it as a 360° evaluation tool that ensures you’re prepared for challenges and ready to capitalize on opportunities.

# How to Conduct a SWOT Analysis of your business idea?

1. **Set Your Objective:** Start by defining the goal of your analysis. For example, “Is this business idea viable in my target market?” or “What are the risks of launching this product?”
2. **Create a 4-Quadrant Grid** Divide your paper or digital document into four sections:
   * Top left: **Strengths**
   * Top right: **Weaknesses**
   * Bottom left: **Opportunities**
   * Bottom right: **Threats**
3. **Analyze Internal Factors (Strengths & Weaknesses)** These are within your control and directly tied to your business idea:
   * **Strengths (S):** What gives you an edge? Examples include unique skills, strong networks, or access to resources. *A*sk yourself the following questions: What do I do better than others? What resources or assets do I have?
   * **Weaknesses (W):** What could hold you back? Examples include limited funding, lack of expertise, or operational inefficiencies.  *A*sk yourself the following questions: Where am I lacking? What are my financial or skill gaps?
4. **Evaluate External Factors (Opportunities & Threats)** These are outside your control but impact your success:
   * **Opportunities (O):** Trends or external factors you can leverage—like growing demand, new technology, or favorable regulations. *A*sk yourself the following questions: Are there market gaps I can fill? What trends can I capitalize on?
   * **Threats (T):** Risks that could derail your plans—like competition, market downturns, or regulatory changes.  *A*sk yourself the following questions: Who are my competitors? What external risks could harm my business?
5. **Brainstorm Collaboratively:** If possible, involve others in the process—mentors, friends, or team members. Use sticky notes or whiteboards to capture diverse perspectives and avoid groupthink.
6. **Prioritize & Strategize:** Once your grid is filled, rank each point by importance. Focus on leveraging strengths to seize opportunities while addressing weaknesses and mitigating threats.

# Why Use SWOT?

A SWOT analysis gives you clarity on whether your idea aligns with your goals and market realities. It’s not just about identifying problems but also crafting strategies to overcome them.

Hope this was new and helpful.

I'm not feeling the attraction; should I try and let it grow?,"Hello! I(F23) could use some advice on this. I know I’m kinda all over the place so I apologize in advance.

About a year ago I decided to stop using dating apps(I hadn’t been able to meet anyone through school and went on a few dates with a guy who was nice but I just wasn’t physically attracted to him–we’re still friends) and to try and meet someone the old-fashioned way! It went… a lot worse than expected. I work in a female-dominated workplace and even though I engage in social hobbies(knitting circles, cooking classes, volunteer work), I rarely interact with men my age outside of my friends. I’ve been mostly content with being single but I would like to be romantically involved with someone! 

I decided to get back on Hinge just to make sure I was still capable of going on a date and not being a total weirdo. I matched with a guy through Hinge and we talked for a week or so and eventually met up and went on a date! We got coffee and then walked around a bit and got lunch and were together for about 6 hours. It was pleasant and we had lots of good conversations and it wasn’t very awkward, but I didn’t feel super physically attracted to him. I know that sometimes I can take a while to be interested in people in terms of intimacy but usually I can decide pretty quickly if someone is attractive to me. 

On paper he’s great. He has a steady job and a great relationship with his family. He remembers so much of what I tell him and we mesh quite well. He bought a book I’d mentioned wanting to read and gave it to me on the first date and brought my flowers(I gave him a loaf of bread I cooked and some cookies because I’d mentioned both to him and I thought it’d be nice). I guess I can imagine being intimate with him but I think it might be more related to that fact that I haven’t had sex or even been touched by anyone in over 2 years and I’m incredibly touch-starved. And, I know this is gonna make me sound incredibly shallow and horrible, when we walked past another young man who I found attractive, I would feel disappointment that I was with my date. 

After we’d been walking for a while, he also asked to be exclusive since he, “knows what he wants.” I didn’t have an issue with this at the time since I usually only will go on dates with one person at a time since that’s just what works for me, but now I feel like he’s the type of person who wants a relationship and will keep pursuing it pretty aggressively. I expressed that I wanted to be friends first and take things slow(I know this is silly since we did meet on a dating app–I am literally never going to download one again) and he said he was fine with going at my pace. However, I still feel like things are moving too fast for me to keep up with. He’s always mentioning future places to take me and things we can do, and after we parted ways after our first date he called me by a pet name(I did tell him I didn’t like that). It feels a lot like he’s further along on the path to a relationship and is just waiting for me to keep up. I don’t want to feel rushed–even if he isn’t doing it intentionally–and feel like I’m letting him down by not being as into him as he seems to be into me. In a way, I kind of feel like I'm trapped. Like, we matched maybe 2 weeks ago? And I feel like I shouldn't feel so anxious about all this. If we had met casually and become friends, I think we could've grown close and I would've been attracted to him in the way you do sometimes when you're friends for a while.

I’m torn between two main points now. On the one hand, maybe if I give it time, he will become more attractive to me and I’ll wanna be a couple? Obviously, I didn’t have many options when I wasn’t on a dating app so am I sabotaging my chances with a perfectly nice guy? I know that dating apps have made it hard for people to stay with someone because the allure of another, better partner appearing is there, but also I feel like I should be less conflicted about him. I also don’t feel like I should be almost convincing myself that I am attracted to him and I just need to be around him more to realize it. 

On the other hand, what if we continue to go out and I don’t feel any more attracted and now he’s more attached and I’m an asshole because I was leading him on. If he hadn’t expressed that he wanted this to be an exclusive(and more serious) thing, I guess I wouldn’t feel as bad about continuing to go on dates because things would feel more casual but if he’s investing so much time and energy into me, I think I will feel like I HAVE to make this into a relationship. And if I went out with someone and they weren’t that into me but kept going on dates because they felt like they wouldn’t have any chances with people IRL, I’d feel really shitty. 

Also, he has my dad’s name. He goes by a nickname but… that also feels a bit weird. But maybe I’m just looking for another reason to end things because saying, “He’s not attractive to me,” feels too shallow. I’ve decided to go on one more date to see if I feel any more content being with him but if I’m still so torn, I think I should end things before it gets any more serious. I appreciate any insight on this! Thank you.",0,1744306069.0,dating_advice,7,0.5,False

I am playing around with a few different ideas for a floor plan. There are elements of each that I like, but I also see some cons to each. I shared my thoughts below, but would love to hear opinions!

I know Jack and Jill are controversial, but that is not an element I will be changing due to the fact that I really like it. I would consider having all the bedrooms have their own bath, but I would eliminate the full basement bath (not pictured) to save on costs which I don't love but would be willing to do.

The first plan has a two-story great room, which I like, but forces us to build most of the home over the garage. Some of the rooms are a bit ridiculously big, but that is because it is more cost-effective to have fewer jogs in the framing.

[Great room Open to Above](https://preview.redd.it/cl9fdq78k1ue1.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2beb7e7f3ffcf1bf33fdc3a3748a8ed2f91a1e0)

The second plan takes this idea and removes the two story great room. This allowed me to move the dining room over. Not drawn, but I would like a covered patio off of the dining room, and our lot has a good view to the right, so that is the goal!

[Shifted dining room over, allowed for L shaped Kitchen](https://preview.redd.it/6gztftuik1ue1.jpg?width=1064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3716ce9a3253ffa1987e1594cb1ec1a91a349f8b)

The last plan was my attempt to not use the bump out. I think the upstairs closets got weird on me, but not sure if that is a bad thing or not.

[Same first floor as above](https://preview.redd.it/43e0e0xqk1ue1.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79bf15d3d12378635b5c6637720ad70a4b831ffb)

This is just really a starting point for me. I will probably hand draw and play around with whatever plan I land on, so I guess I am mostly looking for which one has the best potential to be a starting point rather than which one is ready to build lol.

Some calendars even provide QR codes that link to online resources with more in-depth brewing guides and information about the specific farmers and cooperatives that produced the coffee.

**Calendar Design and Presentation:** The visual appeal of the advent calendar contributes to the overall experience. Sturdy construction, attractive graphics, and a thoughtfully designed layout enhance the anticipation and excitement of opening each day's coffee. Some calendars feature themed designs, such as winter landscapes, coffee-related illustrations, or elegant minimalist patterns.

## Core Benefits

The benefits of investing in a high-quality coffee advent calendar extend beyond simply enjoying a daily cup of coffee. These calendars offer a unique prospect for exploration, convenience, and enhanced enjoyment.

**Discovery and Exploration:** A coffee advent calendar gives you the chance to sample a wide range of coffees without committing to full bags.

This is especially convenient during the busy holiday season when time is limited. The individually packaged coffees are ready to brew,allowing you to quickly and easily enjoy a delicious cup without any fuss.

**Enhanced Sensory Experience:** Beyond the taste, a coffee advent calendar engages multiple senses.

**What type of coffee is typically included in coffee advent calendars?**

These coffees are frequently enough ethically sourced and roasted by skilled artisans to highlight their individual nuances. The selection typically includes a mix of single-origin coffees, blends, and flavored varieties.

**How much coffee is included for each day?**
The amount of coffee per day usually ranges from 10 to 15 grams, which is enough to brew a single cup using most brewing methods, such as pour-over, French press, or drip coffee maker. Some calendars may include slightly more coffee for methods that require larger quantities, such as espresso.

**How do I choose the right coffee advent calendar for my taste preferences?**
Consider your preferred roast level, coffee origins, and flavor profiles. If you enjoy light and fruity coffees, look for calendars that feature african beans and washed processing methods.

Looking for Female Roommate,"Hey everyone, my roommate and I are looking for a 3rd roommate to move in with us in a Bucktown apartment for a July 1st move-in date. FEMALE ONLY. 

The big room is on the second floor along with Sophia's room with a shared bathroom. Tim's room is on the first floor along with the main living area, kitchen and 2nd bathroom/guest bathroom. It would be around $1100 plus utilities (water included in rent). 

Big draw for this apartment is PLENTIFUL FREE STREET PARKING in the immediate area. We never have to worry about finding a parking spot close to the apartment which is a massive plus for us with cars.

There is 1 dog in the apartment who is super sweet and loves people!

About Tim (26): I work from home as a data manager and I'm a musician on the side. Very organized. Love music, movies, sports, video games. Not one to go out too much.

Sophia (29): I love going to local coffee shops and hiking/adventuring on weekends. I'm also a dance teacher and go out of town for dance events every so often. I'm pretty laid back during the week and hang out with my dog after work.

We need to have a roommate by April 30 to re-sign the lease, so if you're interested please hit me up on instagram nomad.dancer!",1,1744305929.0,chicagoapartments,1,0.99,False

The psychology behind these genius campaigns.,"Cartoons aren’t just for kids—they’re a $16 billion marketing powerhouse! From doubling social media growth to boosting sales, here’s how brands are winning with animated visuals.

# 1. Social Media Superstars

Example: A coffee shop’s comic series increased foot traffic by 35% in months.

  
**Why it works:**  
✔ 54% of consumers prefer visual content (HubSpot)  
✔ Cartoon posts get 3x more shares than text  
Pro tip: Create a recurring comic character (like a quirky coffee cup) to build brand familiarity.

# 2. Explainer Videos That Actually Work

**Example:** Slack uses comic-style guides to simplify onboarding.  
**Stats:**  
➔ Animated videos boost conversions by 20%  
➔ 95% of viewers retain info from cartoons vs. 10% from text  
**Try this:** Use tools like Vyond or Canva Animator for DIY cartoon explainers.

# 3. Email Marketing That Gets Opened

**Case study**: A digital agency added comic strips to newsletters → open rates jumped 42%.  
**Why?**  
→ Humor disarms audiences  
→ Visual breaks in text increase readability  
Hot hack: Feature a mascot (like Mailchimp’s Freddie) in email headers.

# 4. Packaging That Pops

Winner: Coca-Cola’s animated holiday cans outsell static designs 2-to-1.  
Science says:  
🔹 Cartoon packaging increases perceived fun by 68%  
🔹 Kids (and adults!) are drawn to characters  
Steal this: Add a cartoon mascot to your product labels (e.g., Tony the Tiger).

# 5. Website Banners With Personality

Data: Sites with comic-style CTAs see 27% more clicks.  
Best uses:  
✓ Error pages (e.g., 404 “Oops!” comics)  
✓ Tutorials (Ikea’s assembly comics)  
✓ Testimonials (client stories as comic strips)

# 6. Characters That Sell

Match your industry to a mascot:

* Tech: Futuristic robots
* Food: Animated ingredients
* Fitness: Gym equipment with faces Success story: Duolingo’s passive-aggressive owl boosted app downloads by 40%.

# 7. Viral Humor = Free Marketing

**Why funny cartoons win:**  
😂 6x more shareable than serious content  
😊 72% of people prefer brands that use humor  
Formula: Problem (exaggerated) + Cartoon Solution + Relatable Punchline

# Key Takeaway

>

Your move: Start small with a comic-style Instagram post or animated logo. Watch engagement grow!

She currently has 4 full double sided clear cases for all her nail polishes, but she keeps getting more every month and soon will need more space. She has the basic kits, but also has all these extra tools like magnets for magnetic polishes, polish holders, nail swatch sticks, a DIY nail polish kit, a silicone mat, nail art kit, and probably quite a bit more that I am forgetting/don't know of.  
  
I think my best bet is either a larger organizer or something useful for the process of painting nails. For the organizer, the one caveat to getting something like furniture is that she likes to come over every weekend and bring everything with her so she and her mom can paint their nails together. As for the other idea, I was thinking maybe something to ensure she can comfortably paint her nails, since she currently uses the couch and coffee table to do her nails while watching tv, so her posture is bad for an extended period of time.

First off, thank you for taking the time to read this—really appreciate the help in advance!

I’m 22 years old with fairly healthy teeth and no major sensitivity issues. But I’ve always been conscious about how yellow they look—especially since I have fair skin, so the contrast really stands out.

I drink black coffee regularly (rinsing my mouth after every cup), and I used to smoke but quit over a year ago. I brush once a day using Colgate Visible White (the purple one), though I did notice that when I skipped coffee for about 10 days and brushed twice a day, my teeth looked visibly better.

Now, a close friend of mine who recently opened a dental clinic suggested bleaching and has ordered a kit for me from a brand called PaloDent. She also mentioned that I’d need to come in every 6 months for maintenance.

But now I’m wondering—do I even need bleaching? Or am I just being too conscious? I want to know:

Is bleaching safe and worth it long-term for someone like me?
If not, what’s a proper oral hygiene routine I should follow for whiter teeth and stain prevention?
Any toothpaste, toothbrushes, whitening strips, or flossers you’d personally recommend?
Bonus question: I’m also considering a tooth piercing just for the look—any idea how much it costs (excluding service charges, since my friend owns the clinic)?

Unless they find out it's definitely not gluten-related, as soon as my test samples are sent out, I'm planning to cut out gluten entirely even if the tests are negative in case it's a non-celiac gluten sensitivity, at least until I know more. 

But since realizing this is a possibility, I've been very anxious about what I might have to give up. One of my favorite things to do is walk to coffee shops, grab a latte, and read. I also happen to be a barista, so I make drinks for myself constantly. I know none of the food is safe unless it's prepackaged and labeled, but what about drinks? Most coffee shops have both dairy milk and non-dairy options, like almond, soy, oat, or coconut milks. As a barista, I know cross-contamination for allergens in the milks is unavoidable, because the steaming wand and equipment can only be cleaned so much and it's not always enough for nut allergens.

So are there any non-dairy milks that often contain gluten? If so, what are some safe brands and brands to avoid? Same goes for syrups - I would imagine that, as long as it's not made with any equipment that comes into contact with gluten, house-made syrups are fine (I've made lavender syrup before so I know there's no gluten in it), but what about manufactured ones? Are drinks from Starbucks safe?

Struggling to lose weight? You’re not alone. Between busy schedules, cravings, and slow metabolism, shedding pounds can feel like an uphill battle. But what if your morning coffee could be part of the solution? 

Recent research—and supplements like [Coffee Slimmer Pro](https://predesigned-091-98827.getresponsesite.com/)—suggest that coffee, when used strategically, can boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and enhance fat burning. But how much of this is science, and how much is hype? 

In this detailed guide, we’ll break down: 

- The proven ways coffee supports weight loss 

- How caffeine and chlorogenic acid (found in Coffee Slimmer Pro) work 

- The best coffee habits for fat loss 

- Common mistakes that ruin coffee’s benefits 

- Whether coffee-based supplements are worth it 

By the end, you’ll know exactly how to use coffee—or a high-quality supplement—to support your weight loss journey. 



 The Science: How Coffee (and Coffee Slimmer Pro) Aids Weight Loss 

 1. Caffeine Boosts Metabolism & Fat Burning 

Caffeine is a natural stimulant that activates the nervous system, increasing: 

- Thermogenesis (calorie burning) by 3–11% (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition). 

- Fat oxidation by up to 29% in lean individuals. 

Coffee Slimmer Pro leverages this by using premium caffeine sources for sustained energy without crashes. 

2. Chlorogenic Acid Slows Fat Absorption 

Found in green coffee beans (a key ingredient in Coffee Slimmer Pro), chlorogenic acid: 

- Reduces carbohydrate absorption in the gut. 

- Lowers blood sugar spikes, preventing fat storage. 

A study in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome found that chlorogenic acid helped reduce body fat in overweight adults. 

3. Suppresses Appetite & Cravings 

Coffee (and supplements like Coffee Slimmer Pro) can: 

- Lower ghrelin (the hunger hormone). 

- Increase peptide YY (a satiety hormone). 

This leads to fewer cravings and reduced calorie intake naturally. 



Coffee vs. Coffee Slimmer Pro: Which Is Better for Weight Loss? 

Regular Coffee typically contains a variable amount of caffeine, ranging from 80 to 200mg per cup. It usually has low levels of chlorogenic acid unless it's made from green coffee beans. Regular coffee doesn’t include any additional fat-burning ingredients. It also requires brewing, which may be less convenient for some users.

[Coffee Slimmer Pro](https://predesigned-091-98827.getresponsesite.com/), on the other hand, offers an optimized caffeine dose specifically designed to support fat burning. It’s rich in chlorogenic acid, thanks to the inclusion of premium green coffee extract. This supplement often contains additional fat-burning ingredients like L-carnitine and green tea extract. Unlike regular coffee, it's available in ready-to-use capsules, making it more convenient for on-the-go use.

Best For You? 

- If you love coffee and want a natural approach, stick with black coffee + smart habits. 

- If you want maximized results, a science-backed supplement like Coffee Slimmer Pro may help. 



 Should You Try [Coffee Slimmer Pro? 
](https://predesigned-091-98827.getresponsesite.com/)
If you struggle with: 

- Slow metabolism 

- Stubborn belly fat 

- Energy crashes 

- Sugar cravings 

…then a high-quality coffee-based supplement might help. Look for: 

🔹 Green coffee bean extract (for chlorogenic acid). 

🔹 Natural caffeine (no synthetic jitters). 

🔹 No fillers or artificial additives. 



Final Verdict: Coffee Can Help—If You Do It Right 

Coffee isn’t a magic pill, but science confirms it can: 

✔ Boost metabolism 

✔ Burn more fat 

✔ Suppress appetite 

✔ Enhance workouts 

For best results, pair it with: 

- A calorie-controlled diet. 

- Regular exercise. 

- Quality sleep. 

Or, try a trusted supplement like Coffee Slimmer Pro for an extra edge.

Hi all,

My family and I are heading to Kanab, Utah soon for a trip that includes Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon North Rim. We’re celebrating my dad’s 80th birthday, so I’m looking for restaurant recommendations (and even good local butchers/markets) around Kanab. The week of April 20th. 

We’ll be a group of 6 people — a mix of Boomers, Millennials, and teens — and we’re staying at a vacation home, so we’ll probably cook a few meals too.

We’d love a variety of places:
	•	Good sit-down spots for dinner (especially for a birthday meal)
	•	Casual places for a quick bite after hiking
	•	Local butchers, grocery stores, or farmers markets to pick up meat and fresh ingredients
	•	Good breakfast or coffee shops

And definitely good BBQ and Mexican

We’re open to all kinds of food  — and would love to find some local gems that aren’t super touristy.

Thanks in advance for any tips or must-visit spots!

1jw30kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catalina/comments/1jw30kk/trip_report_family_with_three_kids/,"Trip report, family with three kids","I wanted to add a trip report to help anyone else who may be searching through this subreddit for advice. We are a married couple with three middle/elementary aged children. We were there this past week for our kid's spring break. 

We took the ferry from Dana Point to Avalon. Upon arrival we rented a golf cart for a few hours to kill time while waiting for check-in at our hotel. You can pretty much cover the entire drivable areas around Avalon in an hour or so, including stops at Vista points. The place we rented from required a cash deposit but there are ATMs nearby. Funny enough, this was one of our kid's favorite activities because they got to ride backwards on the cart. We rented them again on our last day at their request. It was nice to explore and easily get some views from either side of Avalon.

Activites:  
Mini Golf: fun, inexpensive course that was surprisingly difficult at some holes. Killed an hour and the kids loved it. We did it twice.

Middle beach/step beach: these were nice to hang out at but swimming wasn't great due to the rocks on the shore. Water socks would solve this problem easily. We are used to swimming in colder water and the temp wasn't bad. No waves. Beaches were small but not crowded.

Botanical Gradens/Wrigley Memorial: this is a great place to kill a foggy morning. The fog didn't make it up to the gardens and it was nice and sunny inland. We hiked up to the Garden to Sky Summit, 1.2 miles uphill. Saw a fox along the way. The trail is a two-track dirt road the entire way, with options to continue hiking to other spots if you have the time/energy. Cool views at the top, you can see San Clemente island to the west. The kids did fine, just bring plenty of water because the shade disappeared as the day moved on. In total the gardens and the hike took up the entire morning, just enough time to let the fog burn off so we could enjoy the beach.

Descanso Beach/Aerial Adventure: zipline was closed due to maintenance, so we opted for the aerial adventure ropes course. There is a height/weight limit for the course. The course was extremely safe, all gear and harnesses were clean and functional/updated. The guides were very helpful and encouraging. There are multiple courses for varying degrees of skill level, my youngest barely met the height requirement and got through the beginner sections just fine. They have more advanced courses that were fun for the older kids, but they enjoyed the intermediate ones the most. After the safety briefing you get about an hour to get through any courses at your own pace.

Descanso beach has an open area to hang out in front of the restaurant. You can rent cabanas or lounge chairs with umbrellas nearby. We rented four chairs even though there were 5 of us, they didn't mind. We brought snacks and they didn't seem to care about that either, although we still ordered some apps and drinks. The website says no outside food or drink, I'm guessing that if you brought in a few pizzas or an actual meal they would say something. You can rent kayaks/paddleboards and snorkel gear nearby. Beach is just as rocky at the shore as the other beaches in the area. A side of fries wasn't on the menu but it was a decent portion and only $6, that's the best bang for your buck if you're just trying to hold over until dinner. Conversely, an order of chips/guacamole was $18.  

We spent a good amount of time walking around, shopping, and just relaxing/hanging out at different spots near the water. There's a giant chess set near the courthouse that was fun to play with the kids. There's a basketball and volleyball court near the golf cart rental area, as well as a playground.  

Lodging: 
We stayed at the La Paloma Las Floras, they had a room that slept 6 that had a small kitchen area. The hotel is beautiful, lots of charm and tucked away from the main area of Avalon but still a short walk from everything. The rooms are dated and small but were clean and reasonably priced. Owners are very friendly and accommodating. It was quiet in the area for our entire stay. 

Food:  
For breakfast and lunch we bought food at Von's, the only grocery store I saw in Avalon. We made breakfast at the hotel and packed a lunch each day to save some money. For dinner we picked a different spot to eat every night.  
The Lobster Trap, Bluewater Avalon, and Buffalo Nickel were the three spots we went. All had decent food and good options for kids/picky eaters. Service was good everywhere, a little slow at Bluewater even though it wasn't crowded. Seemed like everything took longer than usual there. Standout dishes were the Blackened Swordfish at Bluewater and the Ceviche with spicy cucumber at Buffalo Nickel. Buffalo Nickel is a short haul from Avalon, if you call them they will send a free shuttle to and from the establishment. Best views were at Bluewater, naturally. There are a few spots to get ice cream, all were standard ice cream shops. Best coffee was at Catalina Island Brewhouse, but Catalina Coffee and Cookie is open earlier if you need your fix before 7am.

Transportation:  
You can walk just about everywhere. The only times we used transportation was the free shuttle to Buffalo Nickel, and a short taxi to the Wrigley Memorial/Botanical Gardens. We walked to Descanso Beach because we wanted to see the Casino up close. For the taxi we used Ride Circuit, an electric golf cart that uses an app similar to uber. It was $6 for each trip not including tip. 

Final thoughts:  
It's a beautiful island and the people were very friendly. I think prices were reasonable considering its a tourist area in California (compared to other places we've visited). We only did half of the available activities, if that, so I'm sure others can chime in to cover the good stuff we probably missed. We're not big on planned, action-packed trips and prefer to just cruise around and tackle things as we come across them. The island is calm, quiet and charming, which could also be due to the time of year/days that we came (weekdays in April). There were two days that cruise ships showed up for the day, those days were more crowded but it never got crazy busy. The cruise ship schedule is easy to find online, I would book things in advance for the days that they show up if it's an activity that you don't want to miss. 

I wouldn't pick Avalon as a place to visit if you want legitimate ""beach"" days where the kids run around in the sand and play in the waves, there are better places in CA for that. It's a great spot for a short vacation or even a day trip if you live or are visiting in SoCal. For me personally, I wouldn't spend more than a few days in Avalon unless I planned on hiking and exploring the rest of the island. 

We've vacationed just about everywhere along the coast of CA and Avalon is a very unique spot compared to other places we've been. It's a different vibe entirely and almost feels like you've traveled back in time while you're there.  We had a blast and the kids thoroughly enjoyed the trip. We'll be back in some capacity in the near future, I'm sure of it.",8,1744304777.0,Catalina,0,1.0,False

I 25 f met my husband 26 m at 17 years old. I actually messaged him and said come pick me up let's go out for coffee. 

We did not have a happy start but that's to be expected when you meet as teenagers. 8 years later and I genuinely and truthfully can say that this is my soul mate. 

It's like I wrote him in a book. 8 years and 2 kids plus I'm pregnant later I still get butterflies. When we had our 2nd baby my first shower ever he shaved my legs and washed my body and told me how beautiful I was the entire time. He was an absolute pro at setting up post partum pads for me and he didn't leave my side the entire week and a half we were there while I fought for my life. 

He's blue collar so he works hard daily to allow me to stay home with our babies. Yet he still comes home and helps me with anything I need. 

Everything about us matches up. Our music taste matches, we very much enjoy playing games together (we are currently playing lords of the fallen together and by together I mean I run around until I find a big scary guy then give him the controller), he's 6'5 white with blue eyes and I'm 5'2 olive toned with brown eyes both our kids have come out a perfect mix of brown with brown eyes and white with blue eyes they are our carbon copies lol. We basically do something together every night when the kids go down even if that means he does his thing and I sit by him and do my thing. 

Intimacy between us is electric. We've never lost our spark. We've maintained steady Intimacy between 2 post partums and 3 pregnancies. I genuinely look forward to Intimacy and think about pouncing on him probably everyday. Plus they don't tell you that the longer you're with someone the more you basically know with certainty what their body is going to enjoy. It's like someone gave him a manual on my body and he memorized cover to cover. Half the time things go a little quicker for us but we both leave the session like a firework was set off in our bed. 

I love cooking it's one of outlets and while most the time I hit the mark and I know I'm feeding him good there have been times that I mess up and the result is disastrous but his dedication is fierce and he eats it up happily (despite me asking him not bc I won't even eat it lol)

Our life isn't perfect by any means but I can't see anywhere else I would rather be than playing Martha Stewart, raising my babies, and taking care of my giant man. I lucked out in my life so much and I couldn't be happier ♥️.

I have a childhood friend who became a priest years ago, and when he’s on vacation, he lets me take care of the church. Well… I take care of the church.



You gonna ask how? Well, I sell the wine so it doesn’t go to waste. I exorcise demons so people shouldn’t need to wait until my friend returns. Anyways, one day—



It was a hot summer night. I was sitting at home watching a football game, already three beers in, drinking the fourth, eating chips, smoking cigarettes.



My doorbell rang.



I wasn’t expecting anyone, so I got curious and opened the door. In front of me stood a guy in his late thirties, wearing a suit. Black hair, black tie, blue eyes. Pretty handsome fella.



“The fuck you waiting for to talk?”



“Is this the house of Mr. Nox? If it is, can I talk to him?”



“You already talking.”



“Hi Mr. Nox. I’m working for an oil company that has a field in a nearby area.”



“Wow, what a cool guy.”



“I believe you want to come straight to the point.”



“And a smart guy too.”



“We might have a problem that needs your expertise. I’m here for a job offer.”



“Well, come inside then.”



I turned back and walked inside. He followed me and shut the door. I sat down on my couch and he took the chair in front of me. I took a sip from my beer and asked:



“So what’s your ‘problem’?”



“Our workers believe a spirit is haunting the oil pump. And I heard that you deal with that kind of thing.”



“Sure. What makes them think that?”



“They say they heard noises, saw things. The climax was yesterday, when one of the workers went missing at night. They’re refusing to work now. Saying the place is cursed.”



“And you want me to exorcise it, right?”



“Yes.”



“Where’d you hear my name?”



“Workers suggested.”



“Did they tell you about my rates?”



“I don’t recall that.”



“Well, standard rate is five G.”



“Sure. No problem.”



“Okay then. When do you need the service?”



“Immediately.”



“That’ll be extra.”



“No problem. Can we proceed now?”



“Sure. Let me get dressed.”



I got up from my couch and headed to my room. Opened my closet and grabbed the only suit I have — black pants, black jacket, white worn-down shirt. I dressed, looked in the mirror.



Medium-length messy beard. Short, slicked-back blond hair, just as messy as the beard. Brown eyes. Big, ugly nose. I looked at myself, smiled. I knew money was coming.



“You are one ugly son of a bitch.”



I grabbed the duffel bag sitting under the mirror, returned to the living room, and said to the guy:



“Come on, fella. Let’s go.”



I turned off the TV, grabbed my cigarettes, went to the door, turned off the lights, put on my shoes, opened the door, walked out with the guy, locked it behind me, and headed to his car.



He had one fancy, new model. Looked good. I got in.



He started driving. We didn’t talk much until I pulled out a cigarette and lit it. He glanced over as I rolled down the window.



“No smoking inside the car, Mr. Nox.”



“How long until we reach the field?”



“Approximately thirty minutes.”



“Well, I’m bored. And I’ll need a way to pass the time.”



“Smoking is one?”



“Yeah. Now shut up and let me enjoy it.”



I smoked in silence. When I finished, I flicked the butt out the window, rolled it up, and asked:



“Tell me everything you know about the situation, Mr... what was your name?”



“You can call me Edward, Mr. Nox.”



“Alright, Edward. Let me hear the story. When did it start?”



“Approximately a week ago. It started small. Some said they heard noise. Some said they saw weird things. But yesterday, someone went missing, and everything went out of control.”



“What’s the sheriff say about the disappearance?”



“They’re searching.”



“Did the guy have any family?”



“No, he doesn’t.”



“Normaly spirits like this tend to target lonely people. You have family, Edward?”



He glanced at me and then back at the road.



“I take it that’s a no, then.”



“The foreman will give you everything you want to hear when we arrive.”



“Yeah.” I leaned back in the seat, closed my eyes.



“Wake me up, will you?” I said, as I dozed off.



Edward woke me up and I got out of the car. I looked around and saw the oil pumps standing still. Dust everywhere. Air smelled like petrol. Workers were all over the place, sitting around a fire.



We walked toward a man in a vest. He came up to us and extended his hand to me.



""Foreman Jones.""



""Mr. Nox or Priest Nox. Both fine.""



""Nice to meet you, Priest Nox. I believe Mr. Edward here talked to you about the problem.""



""Yeah. I want details. But get me a cup of coffee first. And is there somewhere we can sit besides out here?""



""Sure. We can sit in one of the containers.""



""Lead the way then.""



I followed the foreman, observing the workers’ faces as we walked. They looked tired and scared. Whatever was going on had them real shaken up.



But it was nothing for a professional like me, anyways.



We got inside the container. Foreman grabbed a cup of coffee from the machine and sat down in a chair. I sat across from him, took a sip, then looked at him as I grabbed my cigarette pack from my pocket.



""Mind if I smoke?"" I asked.



""Go on, Mr. Priest. Be our guest.""



""So, Mr. Jones... what's your problem?""



""Some people quit overnight. Equipment broke without a cause. And lastly, a guy went missing yesterday. He was a loved guy.""



""Couple days ago, a sludgy thing came up from underground. We tested it, and it wasn’t oil. We still don’t know what it is.""



""There’s a sleeping trailer here that the workers abandoned. Claiming they heard noises. One said he saw something come out of the wall.""



""Also, for days, people say they’ve been hearing noises while working at night.""



""What kinda noises?"" I asked, mocking him inside.



""All kinds. Metal noises. Speaking.""



""Speaking? What does it say?""



""They say they can’t understand.""



""Did you hear anything?""



""I did.""



""Well, I kinda have an idea what it is.""



""It’s probably a vengeful spirit causing trouble. I’ll exorcise it tomorrow.""



""Tomorrow? Why?""



I puffed and smiled, mocking the man.



""Because you can’t exorcise a spirit at night.""



""Well, you’re the pro. What should I tell the people then?""



""Anything you want. I don’t care. Is that abandoned trailer intact?""



""Why you asking?""



""I’m gonna sleep.""



""There? Are you sure?""



""Yeah. I’ll also show the people there’s nothing to be afraid of.""



""As you ask.""



""Lead the way then.""



He got up. I got up and followed him. He showed me the trailer, and I dismissed him, walking toward it. I arrived at the front of the door, and just as I was gonna open it, 



A wrench dropped at my feet.



I looked up. No one was there. It was weird, but I laughed and said:



""Wow. A spirit throwing a wrench at me. So funny.""



As I opened the door, I heard whispers. The one word I could hear clearly was ""Priest.""

Workers were already gossiping.



I went inside and flicked on the lights. The trailer was pretty basic—a little fridge, some kitchen tools, four beds, etc. I took out my clothes and grabbed my pajamas from my bag. I put them on and headed to bed, sleeping like a baby instantly.





""Mr. Nox.""

""Mr. Nox, can you wake up?""

""Mr. Nox, can you please wake up?""



That annoying fella Edward was murmuring beside me. I didn’t even open my eyes.



""What you want?""



""Mr. Nox, it’s morning. Can you wake up? Workers are even angrier. They say something was lurking around last night.""



""What’s the hour?""



""It’s eight in the morning, Can you wake up so we can proceed with the... ‘thing’?""



""Yeah. I need to sleep a little more. It’s no time for exorcism now, anyway.""



""Mr. Nox, you need to wake up right now, or else I will terminate our deal.""



That guy really irritated me at that moment. So I got up, washed my face, dressed in my suit, grabbed my bag, and followed him outside.



As we got out, I stopped and asked:



""Can I grab a cup of coffee first, at least?""



""Mr. Nox, please. Let’s proceed with whatever you’re gonna do.""



""Alright, alright. Call everyone outside and bring me the foreman.""



""Sure, but Mr. Nox—before we start, there’s something we need to discuss.""



""What is it?""



""Workers want you to stay here for a couple days. If you’re okay with it.""



""That’ll be two G for every day I stay here. And two G extra for yesterday.""



""No problem.""



""Good.""



I grabbed and lit a cigarette while I waited for the foreman. He came quickly, and I looked around, trying to figure out how to put on a show.



Workers were scattered in different places, all with excited eyes, waiting for me to save them. As I looked around, he asked:



""So, Mr. Nox, what are you gonna do?""



""I’m gonna do a little ritual. Everyone needs to be watching. Then work should start again, and we’ll see if there’s a problem or not.""



""Alright.""



""Now, don’t talk to me or touch me while I perform the ritual, okay?""



""Got it, Priest.""



I grabbed my bag, opened it up, and took out a red carpet. Rolled it out on the ground. Took out four candle holders and stuck them into the ground in a square. I lit them and sat in the middle, closed my eyes, and stayed like that for around fifteen minutes.



As ı slowly got up—



And just as I did, a loud noise hit. A big splash of oil came shooting out of the ground near the pump in front of me.



Everyone screamed and ran around me.

Well… I shit my pants right there.



The foreman ran up and asked:



""What’s going on, Priest? What is this?""



I was frozen. Scared to hell. I didn’t know what to do or what it was, but I knew one thing—I wasn’t leaving without my money. And I was in some serious shit right now.



So, I pulled my move.

I looked at the foreman and said, in a very cocky tone:



""Uhh… this? This is nothing. It’s just the spirit leaving the scene. Nothing to worry about.""



""Go calm ‘em down and start working. I’m gonna have breakfast.""



The foreman left, and I went to the lunch area. Edward was there, drinking a cup of coffee and talking to someone on the phone. I sat down in front of him and waited for him to finish his talk.



Soon, people were screaming outside again. I got up to check.



And, well… I wish I hadn’t.



On top of one of the pumps, someone was hanging.

And under it, three people were staring up at him—blankly. Not moving. Not talking. Unconscious.



We approached them, tried to talk, to move them—but no response.



Soon, Edward came and pulled me away.



And he opened his damn mouth:



""What is going on here, Mr. Nox? A man hanged himself, and three others—God knows what happened. Now tell me, how am I gonna stop these workers from leaving here, huh?""



""Well, Edward, call the sheriff. Let them deal with this shit. Because I’m out, and I don’t give a single fuck about what’s going or gonna be here.""



He kept saying things, but I didn’t listen.

I walked toward the auto park and approached one of the fleeing workers.

Yeah, that’s right—everyone was fleeing.



""Mind giving me a ride to town, fella?""



""Sure, Priest. Get in.""



I got inside the car. He put the keys in and turned it. Ignition clicked again and again.



Yeah. Car wasn’t starting.



He cursed and got out. I looked around.

It wasn’t just ours. Every fucking car wasn’t starting.



That moment, I realized—this thing they talked about?



It’s real.



I left the car and returned to Edward. Took him into one of the containers and yelled:



""Listen, Mr. Edward—call the sheriff immediately. There’s some serious shit going down out here.""



""Oh, is that so, Mr. Nox? Well, let me give you a fucking surprise—phones are not working.""



""What?""



""Yeah, you heard me damn right. Phones are dead. Cars are dead. We’re trapped here, Mr. Nox. And you’re the only one the people are looking at as their savior.""



""Now either you're gonna fix this shit—or God knows what’s gonna happen to us.""



At that moment? I didn’t know what to do.



But I’m a guy who knows things. You catch me?



Anyway, I left the container, and in front of me was a worker, holding a stick and drawing symbols into the dirt.



As I got closer, I saw them—four symbols.

Looked like a foreign alphabet. As soon as I saw them, I remembered a memory I don’t like to remember.



Well, if you’ve read this far, you know I’m not a real exorcist.

But I know a thing or two.



You might be wondering how.

Well, my friend—the one I mentioned—is a real exorcist. Unlike me.

I caught a few tricks from him.



At that point, I figured some things out. It was time to put in real work.



I walked toward the container I slept in last night. As I approached it—



It was already gone.



You’re gonna ask what I mean.

Well, it was covered in oil. Inside. Outside. Spewing everywhere.



As I got closer, I knew everything in there was either destroyed or soaked.



I didn’t take a step inside. Just looked around from where I stood, without touching anything.

Then I turned back—and saw the foreman coming toward me. He looked like he was about to piss himself, like everyone else.



""Mr. Nox, what we gonna do? We’re trapped here.""



""Gather everyone near the lunch container. Everyone. No one should be alone.""



""Okay.""



He ran to gather everyone.

I walked over to the lunch container, slow and tired.



I grabbed my cigarette pack—three left. That made me sad. I lit one anyway.



I was feeling different. Because I was feeling the same way I did years ago,

when I encountered my first spirit. Demon. Devil. Whatever you wanna call it.



I know, I know—you thought I was a conman, right?



Well… you didn’t meet your Uncle Nox yet.



I entered a container near the lunch one and dropped my bag to the floor.

Opened it, grabbed a cross, and put it on my neck.

Took out a case of beer—I always keep three in my bag for emergencies.

Also a pack of smokes.



Oh—I also grabbed a book with a blank cover.



Then I left the cabin, holding my bag. Out front of the lunch container, everyone was there—or it looked like it.



I asked:



""How many people here, Mr. Jones?""



""Seventy-six. Excluding you and Mr. Edward.""



""Okay. Did those three on the pump move?""



""No, Mr. Nox. What’s gonna happen to them?""



""Nothing. Don’t worry. When I deal with the spirit, they’ll be fixed.""



""Alright. Now listen up, everyone. You all know me as Mr. Nox or Priest Nox. I exorcise curses, spirits, devils—whatever you need.""



""Anyway, it’s been a while since I dealt with something this strong, so it’s gonna take some time. But there’s nothing to worry about.""



""Since all of us have needs—like toilets, food, sleeping—I advise you to stay in large groups. Wear crosses if you have one. Do not touch anything weird or oily.""



""Do not disturb me. Bring some coal if we have it. Also alcohol—anything will work. Get some wood if you can. That’s it.""



""If anyone has questions, ask Mr. Jones or Mr. Edward. Mr. Edward, can we speak in a private container?""



He followed me. We entered a container—and without either of us touching it, the door slammed shut behind us.



Edward looked at me, scared.

I laughed, mocking him. Then he asked:



""How are you so calm, Mr. Nox?""



""Well, Mr. Edward, I did this many times. Don’t you worry.""



""But I have some questions about things you’ve been hiding from me since the start. If you're honest, we can end this quickly. If you’re not...""



""There’s a chance that the next dead person will be you.""

Only about 2 months, he is my first boyfriend so I'm  figuring everything out for the first time haha 

I'm kind of head over heels for this guy but I don't know when I should bring up certain topics and it's making me super nervous! The only kind of future talks we've had is things like 'next year we'll do this' and both of us have brought up next year so I think we are on the same page of being long term but haven't had any long term discussions. 

Now one of the biggest things I want to bring up but have no idea if it's too early is the topic of kids. I do not want kids. At all. It's a huge no for me. But I'm so scared to bring up the topic because I don't want to lose him if he does want kids. I know I need to bring it up but fuck im so scared to. 

The next things I want to bring up I know needs to happen after the kids talk but I also feel like it's way too early to and I have a problem with not trusting my judgment or emotions, so I always fight with myself, its like I have two different people fighting in my head. One side says ""trust your self! It feels right so just go for it, whatever happens happens!"" !and then the other side says ""whoa, slow down, you  can get too excited sometimes and you've had stuff blow up in your face before"" and I never know which one to go with. 

The first thing I want to bring up is telling him I love him. Again part of me knows it's way too early for this but the other part knows that I don't feel like this about just anyone. When did you guys know it was OK to tell your partner I love you? How did you bring it up? 

The second thing I want to bring up, not necessarily do, just talk about lol is moving in together. Again, I know it's waaaayyyy too early to move in together and I'm not suggesting it. But it's been on my mind lately, I'm moving to a nearby town with my mother and we were talking and she asked if I could see myself moving in with him and I said yes. And she said that if it happened, she would move out and he could move in. I know I'm extremely fortunate to have her even offer that, and God i just keep thinking about the prospect and I get so fucking giddy about it and I just want to tell him about it and how it's something we could do in the future! 

I dont want to scare him off lol and again I know it's too early which is why I'm keeping my mouth shut, but when did you guys know you wanted to move in with your partner and how did you bring it up? 

And I guess just as a last general question, how do you bring up hard topics in general? I'm very non confrontational and really struggle to talk about my feelings and reading about other people's experiences really helps me.

Does anyone know of a multivitamin/women’s multivitamin that does not include vitamin B?

Whenever I incorporate vitamin B into my routine I get a UTI. I had a lot of UTIs in my late teens and early twenties. They stopped for a while in my mid twenties. I went to an average check up and my doctor mentioned my blood results showed low vitamin B, started taking a supplement and got my first UTI in years. Stopped taking the supplements. I started drinking coffee beans that had vitamin B12 in the recipe (I thought this would give me less caffeine jitters, and it actually did, I liked that coffee a lot for my energy and alertness) after a few days, had a UTI. These all happened around age 26, and I stopped using vitamin B didn’t have a uti for years. 

Now age 29 I wanted to donate blood and had two times where my iron was too low to donate, so I started taking a general women’s health multivitamin with iron and everything in it. Got a UTI because it had vitamin B in it too! 

I’m notoriously bad at staying properly hydrated which probably has a lot to do with the UTIs, but I stopped taking the multi vitamin and it has not come back. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I am seeking a multivitamin without vitamin B, because when I recently took that multivitamin I was feeling great and my skin looked great, helped a lot with PMS symptoms too. I know myself and I know I can’t manage multiple vitamins every day, I will forget and mess up.

Since the powdered egg shells don’t dissolve, does anyone know if the calcium and magnesium are released from the powder into the coffee due to its acidity, or is this doing nothing for me?

1jw2krv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Luxylom/comments/1jw2krv/google_pixel_9a_review_budget_beast_with_gemini/,Google Pixel 9A Review: Budget Beast with Gemini Brains,"Just spent a few days testing out the newly launched **Pixel 9A**, and I’m honestly impressed. For $499, this thing brings a ton of value—especially if you're into clean Android, solid cameras, and now... AI-powered everything.

**📦 Specs Rundown (for the nerds):**

* **Display:** 6.1"" FHD+ OLED, 120Hz (finally!)
* **Chip:** Tensor G3 (same as Pixel 8)
* **RAM/Storage:** 8GB / 128GB
* **Battery:** 4,492 mAh
* **Camera:** 64MP main / 13MP ultrawide, 13MP selfie
* **Software:** Android 14 with 7 years of updates
* **Price:** $499

**✅ What I Liked**

**1. Design & Build – Major Glow-Up**  
It’s the best-looking A-series yet. Looks more like a Pixel 8 now—sleek metal frame, rounded corners, better in-hand feel. It still uses plastic on the back, but it doesn’t look or feel cheap.

**2. Gemini AI Features – Lowkey Amazing**  
This is where the 9A punches way above its class. You get **Gemini Nano** on-device, **Gemini Live** voice assistant (with real-time suggestions), and **AI tools** like Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, and Summarize in Recorder. Even did a test: I asked Gemini Live to help me order coffee in Spanish, and it *nailed* it with smooth translations and even tone suggestions. Wild.

**3. Display – Finally 120Hz!**  
This was overdue. The 6.1"" OLED panel is now buttery smooth at 120Hz, brighter too (same as Pixel 8). Great for scrolling, media, and gaming.

**4. Camera – Still a Pixel**  
Despite using a different sensor than the flagship 8, the 64MP shooter is solid. Classic Pixel processing magic is still here. Photos are sharp, vibrant, and Night Sight continues to amaze. It can even shoot 4K 60fps on rear AND front cams.

**5. Software & Updates – 7 Years!**  
Google’s giving this phone **7 years of OS and security updates**, which is crazy for a sub-$500 phone. You’ll get Android 21 on this thing, no joke.

**🤔 What I Didn’t Like**

* **No Wireless Charging:** Not a huge deal for everyone, but it would’ve made it feel even more premium.
* **Still No Face Unlock for Payments:** Works for unlocking but not for secure stuff. C’mon Google.
* **Tensor G3 Runs Warm Under Load:** It’s fine for day-to-day, but during gaming or video rendering, you’ll feel the heat.
* **Plastic Back:** It looks good, but glass would’ve helped it feel more premium and durable.

**📱 Verdict:**

If you want a sub-$500 phone that does 90% of what a flagship does—including onboard AI, amazing photos, and a smooth 120Hz display—the **Pixel 9A is an easy recommend**. Google really brought its A-game (no pun intended) here. It’s not just a budget phone—it’s the smartest budget phone you can buy.

**Rating:** 9/10  
**Who It’s For:** Budget users, students, Pixel fans, or anyone curious about on-device AI without breaking the bank.  
**Who Should Skip:** Hardcore mobile gamers or folks who *need* wireless charging.

Yesterday I got a coffee grinder on Amazon (same day delivery) and went to the store to get beans. I had planned to get Illy, but they didn't sell it, so I got a local brand called Mother Earth Coffee instead. A little bit ago, I made coffee but I wasn't thinking and set my electric coil stove to the highest setting. I went to do something else because it normally takes forever for the coffee to start coming out, then a few minutes later, I saw that it was already almost done brewing. I quickly removed it from the burner and it stopped brewing after a moment. I decided to just go ahead and make my usual latte with honey, vanilla, and cinnamon. I was worried it would be bitter or something, but instead... it actually came out really well??? Like, seriously. This is the best coffee I've ever made. It's perfect! Of course, that could also be because I used better beans. I also used the setting on my new coffee grinder that's recommended for moka pots and it looks quite a bit coarser than the preground Illy I was using before (even though that's also made specifically for moka pots). But since this turned out so well and also didn't take forever, I think I'm just gonna do it this way from now on. Am I crazy? Is there something wrong with my tastebuds? Is this all because of the beans? Or does setting the stove to high just have good results with some electric stoves?

1jw2j39,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jw2j39/should_i_move_to_vietnam/,Should I Move to Vietnam,"Hello folks,

So I joined Reddit to ask this question. 

I work for a Swiss based consumer goods company in India. I got promoted and now they’re sending me to Vietnam , Ho Chi Minh City in a leadership position. My move date is on 5th of May this year and till now I haven’t been researching much about life as an indian in vietnam.

For a week or so I researched and my research on YouTube, this forum, and forums like trip advisor, travel fish, and VBF left me thinking if I as an indian should move there.

I realized that my country men and women don’t carry a good image in Vietnam, for reasons that I don’t find implausible, but nevertheless I am quite worried about unnecessary intense micro aggressions , starkly askances and most importantly social ostracization. There a ton of videos on YouTube that I saw recently where many Indians reported rude and disrespectful behavior from locals. I am not doing any blame or shame here, I am just sharing what I found.

A good friend of mine, who is an Indian, is a CFO for Unilever Vietnam, he too asked me to think twice before moving to Vietnam. His case is a bit different though, he lives in Singapore for 20 odd days in Vietnam and the rest of the 10 days in Vietnam.

Now the thing is that I wouldn’t have to navigate when I move into the city. My housing, car and household help everything will be ready before I land. So I am sure I would not be facing any landlord denying me housing because I am form india. 

But I am quite worried what would life be if I go out for a coffee or for a dinner in a nice restaurant. There are tons of YouTube videos from indian travelers stating that they’re not allowed to enter and even chased away.

I know many of you will say do not come and will unleash a string of vilification because of where I am from. But if you give it a thought, and if you were at my place, what would you have done? Also what do the locals in this forum recommend. 

Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism and practical feedback.",3,1744303565.0,VietNam,12,0.64,False

# Episode 1: Cold Open

*It began with silence, and the silence was waiting.*

Raz stared at the line like it owed him money.

“It’s fine,” he whispered. “It’s moody. It’s… evocative.”  
His cat sneezed on the keyboard. Omen noted.

He typed a second line.

*Then came the noise, a whisper of thought wrapped in metaphor.*

“Too vague?” he asked the void. The void shrugged.

Thus began Raz’s journey to write a story. Not *a* story—**the** story. The one he'd been hyping up in his own head for six years. The one destined to launch a dozen think-pieces and at least one indie adaptation with questionable casting.

# Episode 2: Group Therapy

Wednesday night meant Writer’s Group.

Four misfits, one couch, an eternally blinking lava lamp, and a rotating supply of stale biscotti.

There was:

* **Marla**, the genre-hopper who insisted all great stories needed at least one vampire lawyer.
* **Kevin**, who only wrote in the second person and smelled faintly of burnt toast.
* **Tish**, the poet who hissed at adverbs like a cat at a cucumber.
* And **Greg**, who never wrote anything but was incredibly judgmental about fonts.

Raz cleared his throat. “I finally have my opening line.”

The group stared. Tish nodded solemnly.

Greg raised a hand. “What font?”

Raz blinked. “Arial?”

Gasps.

Marla whispered, “You poor, naive child.”

# Episode 3: Plot Holes and Black Holes

Raz was now knee-deep in the “Middle Section Swamp.” His plot threads tangled like last year’s Christmas lights.

There was a librarian with maybe psychic powers.  
A cosmic raccoon named Blort.  
A mysterious key that opened something (possibly metaphorical, definitely sparkly).

Raz scrolled through his draft.

>Chapter 9: Something Happens
Chapter 10: Emotional Stuff?
Chapter 11: Climax TBD

He slapped a sticky note on his forehead that read:  
**“Foreshadow stuff in Chapter 2. You coward.”**

He was now on version 14.7b of the plot, labeled **""Final\_Final\_NoReallyFinal\_3""**.

# Episode 4: Dialogue Is Hard

Raz tried to write character dialogue.

>“We need to leave,” said the librarian.
“Why?” asked Blort.
“Because... the plot demands it.”

“Too meta,” Raz muttered.

He tried again.

>“The stars are falling!”
“Then we better catch them,” the librarian whispered, pulling out a net.

“Too Hallmark.”

He stared at the screen, then down at his coffee mug. It read:  
**“Write drunk. Edit hungover. Cry consistently.”**

Tish would’ve yelled at him by now. Kevin would’ve rewritten the whole scene in haiku.

>Falling stars above
They reflect our inner wounds
But like, in space. Bro.

“Damn it,” Raz muttered. “That’s not half bad.”

# Episode 5: Climax Crisis

Raz sat up straight. This was it. The turning point. The Climax™.

He typed:

>“And then, the raccoon sacrificed himself to save the narrative.”

He deleted it. Then retyped it. Then added dramatic wind noises.

He scrolled back to the beginning. Somehow, the tone had shifted from slow-burn sci-fi thriller to something between Douglas Adams and a particularly caffeinated fever dream.

Raz wasn’t sure if he was okay with that.

Tofu pawed at the screen, accidentally highlighting the phrase *“existential porridge of regret.”*

“Honestly, Tofu,” Raz said, “that’s kind of what this whole thing feels like.”

# Episode 6: To End, Or Not To End

Raz knew how stories were supposed to end: with resolution, catharsis, and probably a character death if he wanted people to care.

He stared at the blinking cursor. It blinked back, smugly.

>“In the end, the silence returned. But this time, it was listening.”

“That’s either brilliant or utter pretentious nonsense,” he said aloud.

Marla texted:  
**“Did the vampire lawyer win the custody battle over the cursed briefcase?”**

Kevin sent a haiku:

>Endings are a lie
Just beginnings in disguise
Eat more toast, my friend.

Raz typed ""The End.""

Then deleted it.

Typed:

>“To be continued... probably, maybe, after a snack.”

He hit save. He closed the laptop. He stared into space.

# Coming Next Week on The Write Stuff:

* Greg hosts a “Fontvention” and bans Comic Sans.
* Raz joins an AI writing forum and is emotionally destroyed by a chatbot that writes better cliffhangers than he does.
* Blort gets a spin-off.
* Tofu gets an agent.
* Kevin burns toast again. No one is surprised.",1,1744303493.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

We had both grown up with ""The Family Proclamation"" on our walls. That document sucks ass, but I like the concept of teaching my kids what we value in our family, and then letting them develop their own values from there.

I'm completely new to composting and would love some advice. I’ve attached two photos – one of my rabbit’s litter box (which contains droppings, and some paper-based bedding) and one of my garden where I’d like to set up a composting system.

Recently, our local waste management announced that kitchen waste disposal is going to be a paid service, so I figured it’s a great time to start composting and put that waste to good use!

I have access to:

* Rabbit manure and used litter (mostly paper, poop, and a bit of hay) this is gonna be the biggest source
* Grass clippings from mowing
* Green/kitchen waste like veggie peels and coffee grounds

What would be the best way to start composting all this? Should I go for a compost bin, tumbler, or a simple heap in the garden? Are there any tools or methods you’d recommend for someone starting from scratch? Do I need to add anything extra or will this compost just fine on it's own?

They are both Marines. It is talked about in Hanna’s jacket between Voight (Nate) and Neil when they meet about Lt Hanna. 

And then earlier in the film, when Neil is waking from his night with Eady, his eagle globe and anchor tattoo is seen on his arm. 

It’s no wonder they have a respect for their respective professionalism, law enforcement and criminality, they realize In each other over the course of the film. They served together in the same branch of military, and Marines certainly love each other and take great pride in their own work. 

This camaraderie is not fake. Serving in the military gives one a sense of exclusivity and distinction. It could be looked at as pride but it’s important when you consider another service member. There is a connection that is instantaneous no matter how short of a time you have known this other person. They are like family. The only other close group I can liken it to is another believer in God Almighty. You instantly share that connection with a fellow believer. 

Hanna and Neil are connected. They share a coffee, smile at each other, and clearly share a respect as they speak during their meet. There is even an honesty that they don’t share with their own females. Intimate information you can see Justine (Hanna) and Eady (Neil) don’t even hear.  This is further shown in that Justine even brings it up — the lack of sharing from her own husband, Hanna. 

The writing in this film continues to have depth even after 30 years (December 15, 1995). However, if you don’t pay attention to police career jackets and tattoos you will miss it. I did and I’ve watched this film around 15-20 times for 20 or so years. The character development was handled with great care and thought processing. Amazing work.

1jw27gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jw27gq/i_lost_a_female_mentorcolleague_due_to_my/,"I lost a female mentor/colleague due to my behavior, and I’m struggling to find closure. Any advice?","A while back, I connected with a female coworker who became a mentor figure to me. We had a few conversations over coffee, where we shared and exchanged personal details and stories which felt meaningful even if it were still professional (She’s in a leadership position for context.) She has a busy schedule and was always juggling a lot, but she still made time occasionally, which I appreciated more than I probably let on.

Over time, things changed and she became less available and didn’t have time to meet anymore. I didn’t handle that well. I got upset and, looking back, I think I put pressure on her by trying to hang out outside of work. I don’t think she ever directly said anything about it, but I know she has strong personal/work boundaries, and my actions may have crossed them. 

Though she initially apologized for not having room in her schedule, the following day she began pulling away and avoiding me for a few weeks. After a few weeks, I checked in on her and she replied asking me not to contact her again outside of work purposes, and she didn't reply to my follow ups. Not long after that, circumstances changed and I ended up stepping away.

I later tried reaching out one last time through LinkedIn, my only avenue of contacting her outside work, hoping to understand what went wrong and apologize properly, but she blocked me. So now I have no way to get closure, and I’m left carrying the weight of guilt and regret.

I’m not trying to rekindle anything. I just want to learn from this and be forgiven, if not by her, then maybe at least within myself. Has anyone gone through something similar?

Would love to hear other people thoughts on this topic.



The rapid advancement of AI has sparked widespread panic, especially in creative fields. Designers fear being replaced by technology. Writers worry ChatGPT will render their skills obsolete. Musicians watch AI generate compositions in seconds.

And have you seen the latest AI-generated videos? Damn. They are getting ridiculously good.

But what if this technological disruption isn't the end? What if it's actually a beginning?

**""Shut up. This is a disaster!! We need to ban the use of AI!!""**

\-- Overdramatic person online

I've seen many discussions on LinkedIn, especially with the launch of the Studio Ghibli style, about the existential crisis that we are facing. While I wholeheartedly agree that AI companies have stolen IP to train their models, there is no point ignoring that this is an **incredible historical moment** to witness first-hand.

There will be lawsuits. Lawyers will make money, and the AI bros will pay fines.

Just as YouTube did. (Most people don't realize, but YouTube grew mainly because they didn't care if you uploaded copyrighted content. Lawyers made money, the software bros paid fines, and the cat videos continued to proliferate throughout our lives.)

# The Reality: AI Is Here to Stay

As with YouTube, AI is not going anywhere. So, how do we, as creative professionals, survive?

When I first encountered generative AI, it was in the OpenAI Beta back in 2021. I felt that familiar mix of excitement and terror I'd experienced throughout my career. Excitement about the opportunities and terror at how easy it was to use.

Over the last twenty-plus years, I have stared down the barrel of new technology countless times, doubting my relevance and value for future career prospects.

However, each technological shift taught me valuable lessons about adaptation and growth.

Remember:

>""Change is the only constant.""

**This was back in freakin 550 B.C.!**

Wrestling with our ever-shifting reality is as old as humanity itself and as common as not remembering the name of the neighbor you say hi to every day.

Each generation faces unique challenges and transformations, yet human resilience and adaptability are timeless.

# Learning from History

So, back to the topic of AI Survival. History shows us that the most successful creatives didn't just survive technological revolutions; they leveraged them to reach unprecedented new heights.

What's even more exciting is that we can predict what will happen in the future by looking at the past.

There is always an Initial State (how things used to be done). Then, some new tech becomes a Disruption Catalyst (like AI), creating Winners and Losers. Let's take a look, shall we?

# 5 Creative Technology Disruptions Throughout History

# 1. The Printing Press Disrupts Scribes

# Initial State:

* Monastic scribes held exclusive rights to book production
* Each book required years of meticulous hand-copying

# 3. Photography Disrupts Painting

# Initial State:

* Portrait painting was exclusively accessible to the wealthy elite
* A single portrait could cost several months of an average worker's salary
* Artist skills were only shared through exclusive guild systems and apprenticeships

# Disruption Catalyst:

* The invention of the daguerreotype (camera) in 1839 revolutionized image creation
* Image-making became rapidly democratized across social classes
* The cost of obtaining a portrait collapsed dramatically within a decade

# Winners:

* Artists who explored new styles like Impressionism and Expressionism thrived
* Photographers who quickly mastered the new medium built successful businesses
* Creative practitioners who combined photography and painting found new markets

# Losers:

* Traditional portrait painters lost their established client base
* Artists serving the middle market saw their business evaporate
* Professionals who refused to adapt faced career extinction

# 4. Digital Photography Disrupts Analog

# Initial State:

* Analog photography dominated the professional and consumer markets
* Professional expertise was highly valued and compensated
* Distribution channels were tightly controlled by established players

# Disruption Catalyst:

* Digital cameras emerged as a revolutionary new technology
* Smartphone integration made photography universally accessible
* Internet platforms democratized image sharing and distribution

# Winners:

* Photographers who embraced digital technology early gained a market advantage

* Internet distribution bypassed traditional gatekeepers
* Streaming platforms transformed consumption patterns

# Winners:

* Streaming services captured massive market share
* Artists who embraced digital distribution found new audiences
* New artists could become successful without relying on traditional record labels

# Losers:

* Traditional record stores closed in large numbers
* Physical distribution networks became largely obsolete
* CD manufacturers saw their market collapse

# Pattern Recognition

It's apparent that each disruption followed a consistent pattern:

* An established order controls the market
* A technological breakthrough challenges existing systems
* The market transforms rapidly and irreversibly
* Winners and losers emerge based on adaptation ability

But there is also another winner that always emerges...

# The 'Premium Legacy Survivors'

# Scribing

* Hand-lettered calligraphy thrives in luxury wedding and event markets
* Limited edition hand-bound books sell for thousands of dollars
* Traditional letterpress printing serves high-end stationery markets

# Printers

* Luxury print magazines thrive with high-quality paper and photography
* Coffee table books command premium prices in specialized markets
* Limited edition art prints serve collectors and design enthusiasts

# Painting

* Master portrait painters continued to serve ultra-wealthy clients seeking prestige pieces
* Hand-painted portraits became luxury status symbols commanding higher prices than ever
* Traditional painting techniques evolved into high-end fine art markets

# Photography

* Film photography persists as a premium artistic medium
* Darkroom prints command significant premiums in fine art markets
* Specialized analog photographers serve luxury wedding and portrait clients

# Music

* Vinyl sales are at an all-time high with a resurgence in buyers looking for tangible, ownable music with fantastic cover art
* Audiophiles maintain high-end analog systems worth thousands of dollars
* Limited edition physical releases command significant price premiums

# Lessons for the Future

So how does this help us? Well, for each technology breakthrough, we see:

* Initial resistance from established professionals defending their expertise
* Quality arguments against new technology (that initially seem valid)
* Market democratization as barriers to entry fall
* Value shifting from technical knowledge to creative interpretation
* Preservation of a premium segment willing to pay for distinctive human creation

With all that in mind, let's explore how you can position yourself to survive the AI revolution and thrive because of it. I am positioning my business for future success based on this.

# Immediate Impact

The current AI disruption follows similar patterns but at **unprecedented speed**. The quality improves weekly rather than yearly, and costs continue to fall while accessibility increases.

Compared to transitions in the past, we need to move much faster.

# Market Response

As with previous disruptions, we're seeing a compression of the middle market. Generic creative services, the ""good enough"" tier that has sustained many freelancers and agencies, face intense pressure from AI alternatives.

Yet simultaneously, the premium segment remains resilient. Brands seeking distinctive voices, original concepts, and strategic thinking continue to value human creativity. The difference is that technical execution is no longer the primary value proposition. It's the uniquely human elements of creativity that command premium prices. **The why behind the how is what people will always pay for.**

But let's dig deeper. We know that there will be winners and losers from our little history lesson earlier, so here are my predictions and recommendations for creative professionals:

# AI's Impact on Creative Fields

# Graphic Designers

# Initial State:

Professional graphic designers established their value through mastery of Adobe Creative Suite and a deep understanding of design principles. The industry celebrated pixel-perfect craftsmanship and custom solutions, while design agencies built reputations on bespoke visual identities. Years of specialized training and building a portfolio marked the path to expertise.

# Disruption Catalyst:

The emergence of AI-powered design tools has fundamentally altered the creative landscape. Generative AI now produces campaign-ready visuals instantly, while automated systems handle basic design tasks like layout and color correction. Tools can now auto-generate entire design systems with consistent brand assets across platforms and formats.

# Winners:

* Designers who become AI Art Directors will orchestrate AI tools to fulfill their creative vision
* Strategic Creatives who elevate beyond aesthetics to solve complex business challenges
* Multi-disciplinary studios offering hybrid services that combine AI efficiency with human strategic expertise

# Losers:

* Production Designers whose routine tasks face increasing automation
* Template-focused Freelancers struggling to compete with AI-powered alternatives
* Traditional Studios clinging to outdated workflows
* Technical-only Designers without strategic or conceptual skills

# Premium Legacy Survivors:

High-end design practices will thrive by offering what AI cannot: Authentic, creative innovation, brand strategy, and artistic vision. These specialists will be few in number, but they will succeed by utilizing advanced knowledge of specific industries and offering solutions that transcend technological replication.

Our choices are basically:

* Embrace AI for maximum efficiency
* Become specialized in a specific domain and charge a premium
* Or, as I am trying to do, both

# Video Producers and Motion Graphic Animators

# Initial State:

* Video production was primarily a labor-intensive process involving significant equipment and personnel
* Creative storytelling through video relied on substantial editing and post-production work
* The market depended heavily on original content creation for advertising, corporate, and entertainment sectors

# Disruption Catalyst:

* Automated video editing tools powered by AI can now manage substantial parts of the editing process, streamlining production
* Reduced requirements for pro-grade equipment lowers the barrier to entry for anyone who wants to make a video

# Winners:

* Producers who utilize AI for efficient content creation and focus on integrating interactive and immersive technologies will excel
* Companies adapting quickly to offer end-to-end solutions incorporating new tech will see substantial growth

# Losers:

* Production houses that cling to traditional methods without updating their offerings will lose competitive ground quickly
* Freelancers who fail to learn new technologies will find themselves left behind
* Studios unable or unwilling to adapt to the demand for quicker turnarounds and dynamic content will not survive

# Premium Legacy Survivors:

* Boutique studios known for crafting unique, high-quality custom content will remain sought after, especially for luxury brands
* High-end producers providing cinematic-quality videos continue to find success in niche markets

# Writers and Content Marketers

# Initial State:

* Content creation was primarily a manual process, reliant on individual creativity and craftsmanship
* The field was defined by labor-intensive research, drafting, and editing tasks to produce engaging content
* Audience engagement relied significantly on creating original, high-quality written material

# Disruption Catalyst:

* AI writing assistants automate content generation, from drafting to initial client revisions, enhancing productivity
* NLP technologies advance content personalization and user-specific interaction capabilities
* Content curation and distribution platforms streamline targeting and engagement strategies across digital channels

# Winners:

* Writers who use AI tools to augment their creativity extend their scope and efficiency in content production
* Content marketers who excel in deploying strategies for personalized user engagement
* Agencies that combine technology with creative storytelling offer enhanced value propositions to clients

# Losers:

* Professionals relying exclusively on traditional writing methods without embracing technology struggle to keep pace
* Companies that fail to deliver personalized digital experiences will lose out to the competition

# Premium Legacy Survivors:

* High-end content creators focusing on long-form, in-depth storytelling will continue to command premium rates
* Authors providing exclusive insights or original research will maintain influential roles in niche markets
* Specialists known for their unique voice, humor, or domain expertise will find enduring success in publishing

# Conclusion: There WILL Be Winners

To summarize, the changes we face do not have to compromise our creativity.

But **do not underestimate the challenge ahead**.

While history has shown us what typically happens when new technology emerges, none of what has come before comes close to the pace of change we see today.

Read a lot. Experiment a lot. Have fun, but find your niche.

The next generation of winners will have a broad skill set across all forms of art, design, and content production. They will utilize an array of AI tools and agents to execute their vision. But they will also have **in-depth knowledge and strategic insight** into specific industries and domains that separate them from the competition.

I'm betting my livelihood on this for my next 20 years of trying to stay relevant and valuable.

I suggest you do the same.

1jw20u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jw20u6/i_gave_up_my_history_grade_for_the_math_grade/,"I gave up my history grade for the math grade, kicking myself out the ""good student"" bench, and it made me realise how important my time is.","History always was and will be a very tough subject for me. My brain just finds it highly frustrating to process and associate long chains of events and figures. It almost feels like kiss and telling the lives of countries and nationalities. The only topic I kinda like is the Great depression and the WW2. And even that is just because I enjoy tracing the economic line of the world. So as soon as I started learning history at school, I knew I would not be so good at it. 

In addition, history teachers tend to always be strict, selective, expecting students will know everything before they teach them. In brief, it is hard to find a history teacher who does not suck at teaching, so don't take it for granted if you happen to have one.

Math, on the other side, is more like a workout, where teacher can support you, but you do not depend on them in terms of actually understanding the material. While doing math, I can simply rely on formulas and my calculator, and getting the numbers I need really eases my mind. One time I caught myself finding square roots of random big numbers using 4th grade math, and guess what, that was the only way to entertain myself in history class. 

On the basis of heat I've said above, you might think I get straight A's in math, but unfortunately it is not true. See, I am a kind of hyperactive-caffeine-overdose-super-inattentive person, so I often unintentionally roll my grade down from an A+ to a B- because of the most stupid mistakes I would probably have laughed at the next morning after making them. I even started writing down some of the most ridiculous things I've done. For example: 
Automatically wrote ""2"" in the denominator of the discriminant formula
Forgot that there are 2 equations in the system, not one
Forgot to change the sign when the fraction is negative
Thought that a trapezoid was a rhombus
Accidentally devided by a zero and somehow got 1.
Was trying to solve a quadratic equation by taking x out of the brackets

And many more stupid things from not being able to add 9+4 to messing up formulas, so my grade was always a B, even though I definitely love math so much.

But this semester was different. We got a history assignment, where we had to make a poster on the absolutism in France. ""Hell yeah, that is my time to shine!"", I thought. No memorising, no stupid wars - pure research and formation. I grabbed my coffee, opened the program and started creating a kind of masterpiece that should had saved my grade and had my teacher impressed.

I engaged all my photoshop skills to make it look gorgeous, spent 3 hours running through what AI bot had given me and researching myself, turned it in on time. I thought it would be a 100%, as nothing was wrong, but eventually I got a B, that lead to getting a C in the semester.

I was so pissed I actually never asked the teacher(one of the decent ones) about it and just, you know, assumed my grade was cooked and stopped giving a shit in class. I would casually sit there scrolling through my camera roll cleaning up the space, doing other subject homework or simply skip classes and go hit the gym instead.

The thing is since I stopped worrying about history at all, I noticed some major changes in my attention and being able to concentrate. I no longer had sleepless nights overthinking whether I would be able to get a decent score on a history test, didn't bother myself with going on the lectures I didn't like anyway. I started making less stupid mistakes in math and now my average score is 4.8, which straight ahead equals an A.

Not only did it make me happy af, but it actually made me realise that all the positive consequences of me not trying to keep my score higher than i was able to (like going to the gym, work on other subjects or minding my own buisness) would add up and still benefit me even though a score lower than usual was a little disappointing. I still will get a B as a year grade, although my little ""bad student"" experience means so much to me.

So I just said to myself and pinned it somewhere in my brain: ""Stop focusing on keeping up something that will still be draining you no matter how hard you try and do what you really enjoy instead"".",1,1744302294.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Some time rolls by and she comes walking into the kitchen. “Ohh you already started cooking, what’s on the menu?” I said “nothing fancy, just eggs and toast. How do you like your eggs?

The trick with scrambled eggs is to not let them sit on the burner too long, gotta take it off and let the pan finish the cooking. 

After a bit of time I brought out her serving. She was shocked, “my ex and I never did this kind of thing, he could hardly do laundry correctly, let alone cook for me or himself 😂” 

I said “really? I grew up by myself so I learned young, small things like Mac n cheese, box dinners and stuff, parents were never home after school, so you teach yourself.” 

“Hah, I grew up like that too, I think a lot of us at our ages did.” 

“Yea mom was working a lot when I was young, then she started partying a lot with friends, I started paying bills at about 15. Since she could no longer afford them.” 

“Wow that’s quite a bit of responsibility at a young age, must have been stressful.” 

“A bit yea, but I was working nearly full time and left school, I was making money hand over fist for a while. Couple hundred on the weekends with just tips! I managed to become manager after about 1.5 years which was helpful, schedule making, ordering food etc.” 

“Well that’s pretty impressive and honorable for a young man, I bet the girls were all over you lol” 

“Not really, I had a couple of girlfriends, but I was not a stud by any means and I worked a lot so I didn’t have time to really date, hell I didn’t even have sex till I was almost 20.”

“Well even for a late bloomer I’m impressed. You learned quickly, I know you learned me quick.” 

“Heh well thanks, you make it kinda easy. Some girls are hard to figure out, but you made your intentions clear. I won’t go into specifics on how I know some stuff, but I’ve had practice” 

“lol yea you mentioned that, well if anything happens today, we’re gonna have to take it easy, I’m fairly sore” 

“Same, I could go a few rounds easy, but only at your pace.”

“Why are you like this?” “Like what?”

“Just like you have a way about you, You haven’t put any kind of pressure and reassured me at every whim.” 

“Well this is the age of internet dating, I think both sides need reassurance these days, I mean meeting someone online, then meeting up in person can be sketchy, Ive heard stories from both sides about bad encounters and stuff. I feel it’s even worse for the fairer of the sexes.” 

“True, I had a friend get catfished by a girl and he got played for a couple thousand, it’s definitely sketchy” 

“Ouch, I know that feeling all too well, I won’t get into it but I felt that pain” 

After a bit we were both done eating I grabbed the plates and cleaned up, she said she was gonna get in the shower quick. Before she left though she came in the kitchen and kissed me on the cheek. “I was hoping you can join me.” 

“I already planned on it, but after I gotta run back home and change clothes if you wanted to spend some time together this afternoon?” 

“It’s a date!” She said. I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest, a feeling of excitement rushed over me. It wasn’t lustful in nature either. It was one of relief. 

I rinsed off the dishes and hurried my butt back to the bathroom, the water was running and just as I poked my head in, there she was getting undressed, I chose to keep my mouth shut and just watch, she was beautiful I couldn’t help but stare, she was mesmerizing in the best ways. 

I finally came in and hugged her from behind. She embraced it, as my hands slipped around her waist, she grabbed on to my hands spun back around and lip locked me. “Hey there..” she said with a sly look in her eyes, I could feel myself getting erect, she could feel it too, she spread herself open a bit, and started grinding on me. It was clear she became instantly wet. We just stood there naked waiting for the water to be just right. A few moments pass by and we both got into the shower. “I like mine hot, I hope you don’t mind.” As I got in I could feel the water, yep typical lava temp. I played it cool and didn’t fully go under the shower till my body got use to it. “It’s just fine” I said with a bit of a wince and a smile. 

“You don’t gotta lie, I’ll turn it down a bit lol” 
I laughed and she just smirked. “Well thank you for being considerate” as I leaned in and kissed her on the forehead. “Not many people are these days.” I recall myself thinking “wow, she’s considerate, really likes me and enjoys my company? Well damn..”  I didn’t say anything further, I felt content. 

We started getting cleaned up, “well I don’t have any manly soap or shampoos..” I didn’t say anything and took her body wash,  lathered up and started washing myself “I don’t mind, I can smell pretty too” she laughed, covering her mouth with her hand. 

It was then I reached over and started lathering up her back and shoulders, she started getting closer to me, our bodies full on skin to skin contact, it was an immediate rush of blood to places. There’s something about skin to skin contact that just does something to me, I could never explain it, but damn it felt good, even more so since it was coming from her. 

I took my time getting her clean, she had no problems reaching behind and helping me get clean too. “You make it really hard for a girl to concentrate you know that right?” I could feel her stroking me again, not nonchalantly any more, it was with a bit of force, and vigorously. “Well you’re the one with you hands all over my cock, you’re just as bad 😜” 

She turned around to me, “guilty as charged, will you wash my front too?” She was gorgeous, water running down her chest, partially soapy hair slicked back from the water. I kissed her as she leaned somewhat forward. Her hands still working my shaft, I started going to work on her chest, squeezing and pulling on her nipples, it wasn’t long after that she moved to the side and helped me rinse the soap off. She kneeled down and started to slowly take me in her mouth, her other hand rubbing her clit and fingering herself. The water falling on us be dammed she wanted it right then. 

Finally she took all of me, somewhat gagging and my cock went further down her throat. Pretty sure she started to cum not long after, I could feel her twinge and pull her head back, letting out a moan, while still trying to fit all of me in her mouth. She stood up right after, and gave me a stare, turned herself around spreading her legs, hands on her ass spreading that too. “Well aren’t you gonna fuck me now?” I moved closer to her, grabbing her hip with one hand and reaching up grabbing on her chest. Just then I started to slip in, I could tell instantly she was sore down there. 

“I wanna go all the way, but I know
You’re sore..” 

“Ohh I don’t mind, every time you enter, I don’t think about it, pleasure takes over and it doesn’t matter.. lol” 

I started going deeper inside her, this time it was different, it was like I reached an area I hadn’t felt before, “fuck what the hell did you hit? And please don’t stop!” She said. 
 
Well both felt it, somehow I was deeper inside than I had ever been, I’m not sure if it was a position thing, or the fact we were going slower, but every time I hit that deep it was a wave of pleasure for both of us. 

“I’m not sure what it is, but every time I hit it, I nearly want to finish.” 

“Well you better finish quicker than, cause Jesus that feels good.. and make sure you don’t pull out..😈😈” 

“You sure about that?” I’m mean it feels good but that’s risky.” 

“It’ll be fine, just trust me.” 

With that I made sure to push further, each time felt like a little deeper, till one time she let me know I was going too deep. I made sure to back off a bit. 

“Babe you feel good but careful” I nuzzled up to her ear and apologized. “Sorry” she turned her head, looked at me and said it’s okay, just finish quick. Kissing me back. I could feel her start to clench me with her vagina, letting me know she was close again too. She was pushing herself back on me using the wall, it wasn’t long after she came all over me.. one or two more pumps and I started to pulse again, one pulse and it went right inside, I pushed in again and shot another pulse, I could hear her moan along as I filled her up. 

“Omg you came so much..where did that come from?” I had pulled out and she turned
to me beat red, blushing. It was rather cute thinking back. 

“I, I, lm not sure, but it felt good.” 

With that the water started getting colder, it was time to get out, I got out first and grabbed her towel for her, and grabbed mine, drying ourselves off, “so park, river, lunch or maybe the beach?” She asked. 

“I’m up for whatever!” I said with a grin. “How does dinner sound too? or is that too much?” 

“Sounds like a date.” 

She smacked my ass again, and kissed me. 

“I’m gonna go get a change of clothes. See you in about 30?” 

“Just get out of here, the longer you take the longer I’m gonna have to wait.” 

With that I was out the door..

I never finished a full pack in a day, but my usual routine was about 3–4 cigarettes daily. Whether it was stress, parties, happiness, or just feeling low, I was always the first one to light up among my smoker friends. Sometimes things got out of hand, and I’d smoke up to 10 in a day but I’d say I was a regular smoker, if not quite a chain smoker.

I tried to quit many times but never made it past a month. The last cigarette—or joint—I smoked was on March 15th at a friend’s party. That night, I got miserably sick. I genuinely thought I was going to die and even asked my friends to call my wife and tell her how much I wanted her by my side. (Turns out I had a really bad reaction to whatever I smoked and drank). After that day I didn’t consume alcohol or cigarettes until yesterday where I had a beer with my onshore boss.

On March 21st, I took a drag from a friend’s vape—it was tempting, and I thought, “Well, it’s better than smoking cigarettes.” I couldn’t say no. I won’t call it an excuse, but it was definitely a mistake that broke my streak.

Fast forward to today—it’s been almost three weeks clean. I haven’t spent a single penny on cigarettes. My coworkers keep asking how I’ve managed to stay away for so long. I told them, “I didn’t just pause—I quit.” Whenever I get a craving, I try to replace it with ice cream, water, or coffee. Thankfully, I haven’t had any stressful events lately that might trigger me to smoke. But every now and then, I catch a whiff of tobacco smoke and the craving hits hard.

I just want to know—when do the cravings actually go away? Sometimes I get terrible headaches, and I’m pretty sure it’s withdrawal from the cigarettes. How do I fight off both the cravings and the headaches?

The rapid advancement of AI has sparked widespread panic, especially in creative fields. Designers fear being replaced by technology. Writers worry ChatGPT will render their skills obsolete. Musicians watch AI generate compositions in seconds. 

And have you seen the latest AI-generated videos? Damn. They are getting ridiculously good.

But what if this technological disruption isn't the end? What if it's actually a beginning?

**""Shut up. This is a disaster!! We need to ban the use of AI!!""**

\-- Overdramatic person online

I've seen many discussions on LinkedIn, especially with the launch of the Studio Ghibli style, about the existential crisis that we are facing. While I wholeheartedly agree that AI companies have stolen IP to train their models, there is no point ignoring that this is an **incredible historical moment** to witness first-hand.

There will be lawsuits. Lawyers will make money, and the AI bros will pay fines. 

Just as YouTube did. (Most people don't realize, but YouTube grew mainly because they didn't care if you uploaded copyrighted content. Lawyers made money, the software bros paid fines, and the cat videos continued to proliferate throughout our lives.)

## The Reality: AI Is Here to Stay

As with YouTube, AI is not going anywhere. So, how do we, as creative professionals, survive?

When I first encountered generative AI, it was in the OpenAI Beta back in 2021. I felt that familiar mix of excitement and terror I'd experienced throughout my career. Excitement about the opportunities and terror at how easy it was to use.

Over the last twenty-plus years, I have stared down the barrel of new technology countless times, doubting my relevance and value for future career prospects.

However, each technological shift taught me valuable lessons about adaptation and growth.

Remember:

> ""Change is the only constant.""
> 
> Heraclitus (550 B.C.) A Greek philosopher argued that the universe is in a condition of continual change.

**This was back in freakin 550 B.C.!**

Wrestling with our ever-shifting reality is as old as humanity itself and as common as not remembering the name of the neighbor you say hi to every day.

Each generation faces unique challenges and transformations, yet human resilience and adaptability are timeless.

## Learning from History

So, back to the topic of AI Survival. History shows us that the most successful creatives didn't just survive technological revolutions; they leveraged them to reach unprecedented new heights.

What's even more exciting is that we can predict what will happen in the future by looking at the past.

There is always an Initial State (how things used to be done). Then, some new tech becomes a Disruption Catalyst (like AI), creating Winners and Losers. Let's take a look, shall we?

## 5 Creative Technology Disruptions Throughout History

## Pattern Recognition

It's apparent that each disruption followed a consistent pattern:

* An established order controls the market
* A technological breakthrough challenges existing systems
* The market transforms rapidly and irreversibly
* Winners and losers emerge based on adaptation ability

But there is also another winner that always emerges...

## The 'Premium Legacy Survivors'

### Scribing

* Audiophiles maintain high-end analog systems worth thousands of dollars
* Limited edition physical releases command significant price premiums

## Lessons for the Future

So how does this help us? Well, for each technology breakthrough, we see:

* Initial resistance from established professionals defending their expertise
* Quality arguments against new technology (that initially seem valid)
* Market democratization as barriers to entry fall
* Value shifting from technical knowledge to creative interpretation
* Preservation of a premium segment willing to pay for distinctive human creation

With all that in mind, let's explore how you can position yourself to survive the AI revolution and thrive because of it. I am positioning my business for future success based on this.

## Immediate Impact

The current AI disruption follows similar patterns but at **unprecedented speed**. The quality improves weekly rather than yearly, and costs continue to fall while accessibility increases.

Compared to transitions in the past, we need to move much faster.

## Market Response

As with previous disruptions, we're seeing a compression of the middle market. Generic creative services, the ""good enough"" tier that has sustained many freelancers and agencies, face intense pressure from AI alternatives.

Yet simultaneously, the premium segment remains resilient. Brands seeking distinctive voices, original concepts, and strategic thinking continue to value human creativity. The difference is that technical execution is no longer the primary value proposition. It's the uniquely human elements of creativity that command premium prices. **The why behind the how is what people will always pay for.**

But let's dig deeper. We know that there will be winners and losers from our little history lesson earlier, so here are my predictions and recommendations for creative professionals:

## AI's Impact on Creative Fields

### Graphic Designers

#### Initial State: 
Professional graphic designers established their value through mastery of Adobe Creative Suite and a deep understanding of design principles. The industry celebrated pixel-perfect craftsmanship and custom solutions, while design agencies built reputations on bespoke visual identities. Years of specialized training and building a portfolio marked the path to expertise.

#### Disruption Catalyst: 
The emergence of AI-powered design tools has fundamentally altered the creative landscape. Generative AI now produces campaign-ready visuals instantly, while automated systems handle basic design tasks like layout and color correction. Tools can now auto-generate entire design systems with consistent brand assets across platforms and formats.

#### Winners:
* Designers who become AI Art Directors will orchestrate AI tools to fulfill their creative vision
* Strategic Creatives who elevate beyond aesthetics to solve complex business challenges
* Multi-disciplinary studios offering hybrid services that combine AI efficiency with human strategic expertise

#### Losers:
* Production Designers whose routine tasks face increasing automation
* Template-focused Freelancers struggling to compete with AI-powered alternatives
* Traditional Studios clinging to outdated workflows
* Technical-only Designers without strategic or conceptual skills

#### Premium Legacy Survivors: 
High-end design practices will thrive by offering what AI cannot: Authentic, creative innovation, brand strategy, and artistic vision. These specialists will be few in number, but they will succeed by utilizing advanced knowledge of specific industries and offering solutions that transcend technological replication.

Our choices are basically:
* Embrace AI for maximum efficiency
* Become specialized in a specific domain and charge a premium
* Or, as I am trying to do, both

### Video Producers and Motion Graphic Animators

#### Initial State:
* Video production was primarily a labor-intensive process involving significant equipment and personnel
* Creative storytelling through video relied on substantial editing and post-production work
* The market depended heavily on original content creation for advertising, corporate, and entertainment sectors

#### Disruption Catalyst:
* Automated video editing tools powered by AI can now manage substantial parts of the editing process, streamlining production
* Reduced requirements for pro-grade equipment lowers the barrier to entry for anyone who wants to make a video

#### Winners:
* Producers who utilize AI for efficient content creation and focus on integrating interactive and immersive technologies will excel
* Companies adapting quickly to offer end-to-end solutions incorporating new tech will see substantial growth

#### Losers:
* Production houses that cling to traditional methods without updating their offerings will lose competitive ground quickly
* Freelancers who fail to learn new technologies will find themselves left behind
* Studios unable or unwilling to adapt to the demand for quicker turnarounds and dynamic content will not survive

#### Premium Legacy Survivors:
* Boutique studios known for crafting unique, high-quality custom content will remain sought after, especially for luxury brands
* High-end producers providing cinematic-quality videos continue to find success in niche markets

### Writers and Content Marketers

#### Initial State:
* Content creation was primarily a manual process, reliant on individual creativity and craftsmanship
* The field was defined by labor-intensive research, drafting, and editing tasks to produce engaging content
* Audience engagement relied significantly on creating original, high-quality written material

#### Disruption Catalyst:
* AI writing assistants automate content generation, from drafting to initial client revisions, enhancing productivity
* NLP technologies advance content personalization and user-specific interaction capabilities
* Content curation and distribution platforms streamline targeting and engagement strategies across digital channels

#### Winners:
* Writers who use AI tools to augment their creativity extend their scope and efficiency in content production
* Content marketers who excel in deploying strategies for personalized user engagement
* Agencies that combine technology with creative storytelling offer enhanced value propositions to clients

#### Losers:
* Professionals relying exclusively on traditional writing methods without embracing technology struggle to keep pace
* Companies that fail to deliver personalized digital experiences will lose out to the competition

#### Premium Legacy Survivors:
* High-end content creators focusing on long-form, in-depth storytelling will continue to command premium rates
* Authors providing exclusive insights or original research will maintain influential roles in niche markets
* Specialists known for their unique voice, humor, or domain expertise will find enduring success in publishing

## Conclusion: There WILL Be Winners

To summarize, the changes we face do not have to compromise our creativity. 

But **do not underestimate the challenge ahead**. 

While history has shown us what typically happens when new technology emerges, none of what has come before comes close to the pace of change we see today.

Read a lot. Experiment a lot. Have fun, but find your niche.

The next generation of winners will have a broad skill set across all forms of art, design, and content production. They will utilize an array of AI tools and agents to execute their vision. But they will also have **in-depth knowledge and strategic insight** into specific industries and domains that separate them from the competition.

I'm betting my livelihood on this for my next 20 years of trying to stay relevant and valuable. 

I suggest you do the same.
