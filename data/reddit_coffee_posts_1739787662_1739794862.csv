Been doing this for the last three years and feel I've exhausted the more obvious stops between the two in the main cities... Durham, Newcastle, Liverpool, Bradford, Manchester, Lincoln, Sheffield, Nottingham, York, Leeds etc, so looking at towns that have good rail links really, obviously these are 11/12 hour days and quite draining but see it as a good opportunity and don't mind the hassle tbh

Really looking for ideas that don't stray too far East/West so Norfolk/Wales border are tricky due to the day legnths and stick mostly central and north of the midlands (only do this journey coming down as I fly back each time, plus I much more enjoy seeing the North , some examples I've done have been...

Lancaster & Morecambe
Hebden Bridge & Halifax
Kendal
Marsden canal walk to Slaithwait & Wakefield
Hull
Harrogate & Knaresborough
Buxton
Bowness-on-Windermere

Enjoyed all of these, I have Skipton/Saltaire booked for a few weeks time so anything that fits a  short compact trip for around 4 hours is really what I'm looking for, have a nose about and grab a coffee etc...I fancy Ripon but seems hard and not wanting to involve buses really but a few others I'm considering are Hartlepool, Matlock, Sunderland, Beverley, Darlington possibly? I've even looked at Oakham as Rutland as a county seems random probably not much at all to see but somewhere to tick it off Haha!

1iriiwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1iriiwh/just_getting_things_off_my_chest/,Just getting things off my chest,"About a year and a half ago I met this girl let's call her A. I liked her instantly, but almost as soon as we met, she found a boyfriend (just a timing thing). So I figured eh... time to move on. We had great communication, she is beautiful and a very cool person, but I figured dealing with my own things would be for the best. For a few months we remained on friendly terms, but one of our mutual friends kept insisting we should get together. She broke up with her bf, we started talking intensely, like for 10ish hours per day, in person or over texts and calls, so eventually I wanted for things to progress. She didn't feel ready for a relationship, so she said no, very respectfully. I stepped back, we didn't talk for a month or two, but picked it up again in June/July? We were friendly through the whole summer, I tried texting some girls, went out with another, but it didn't work out. Whole time I knew where she was and what she was up to as she was texting me. Then came my birthday in September and we talked more than ever before. We are very similar as people, and we created this safe space where we shared everything with each other. I fell for her hard. She in turn initiated calls with my parents and sister, so after that I asked her out, and we started going out together. She still said she wasn't ready for a relationship, but wanted to test the waters and see where it was going. October and November were fantastic, I felt like I was floating, she was very happy as she kept communicating that to me. We didn't get to go out much due to school and work obligations tho, but we managed to hang out every day. Then out of the blue she met up with a guy named L. She told me about him, explained where and when they were going, etc. But I felt uneasy. Still that was a one time thing, she didn't mention him again and I figured I shouldn't fuss.

Then came December, and it was hell on earth. We were in a situation where we had to spend all the time together in a high pressure environment, with other people among which is L guy. I saw he liked her a great deal, we had a major fight over it, as she didn't do anything to shut that down. Other problems propped up her mother didn't want to talk to me due to us dating (she ignored me saying hello to her in the street), she kept me a secret from most of her friends and family, she said she wasn't sure if she was comfortable with me (I truly TRULY didn't do anything she didn't want, had her full 100% consent), she threw my hand away when someone was approaching us, she denied there was anything between us to many people. All of this came out mid December. And then I remembered- we were never clearly out in the open, we only went to places no one would see us. I was heartbroken as she was a MAJOR part of my life, I was completely open, tried to make her feel safe and loved, but... I had to break up. I just had to. And I did. She yelled said some hurtful things, but I felt like I had no choice in the matter. I didn't feel like she trusted or respected me or us.

Then she proceeded to flirt with L for the next 10 days, right after our break up, right in front of me, and due to my obligations at the place I could not leave. I had to watch. She knew, she did it anyway. In the end she entered into a relationship with L, and told me she loved me, but I chose this, I left her. She gave him everything she didn't to me: she was clear, she went public with him etc. And she said it was because of our break up. I went no contact, but she reached out, and I buckled. We started talking again after about a week, and she wanted us to be friends, that under no circumstances we would ever get back together. I told her I wasn't clear on my feelings, but she still said I love you, and asked me to say it back. I was weak, and buckled, we chatted, and met up at a coffee shop, where we cuddled and joked and talked. I tried to frame this as a friendly thing, but I couldn't. I wanted us to talk and set boundaries, but we never did. We had a few fights since then, but she keeps reaching out. Communication is a lot colder, and I can honestly say that I do not love her anymore. I just... I just remember what she meant to me once, and I can't express anger to her, I feel ashamed from being angry in the first place. She is still with the guy. They seem happy, she seems to have resolved her issues. He's a decent person, but I do not want him in my life. She knows that, but I'm not sure she respects that. Her messages have decreased to maybe once per week? When we are in person, she seems to be trying to stay away. I sometimes approach her, but I am fighting to stay away as well. Still she pings me once in a while, I never initiate. Figure it's for the best.

I got a reel from her last night, I sent her a flame emoji. She liked it. It made me sad honestly. It made me sad that our communication and fantastic connection came down to this. I made the right call in ending it... but man it sucks. She does have good qualities, a lot of them in fact, so I do not want to paint her as some sort of monster. She isn't. But we were not good for each other in the end. She probably changed for 'the right guy'. It just wasn't me.",1,1739794587.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

The bed *was* soft, Alia thought, as she came back to the world. She opened her eyes, and with a start realized she was in Four-Forty-Five’s bed. Standing over her was the Eternal - by now she wearing a robe at least -  as well as two medical drones and an older male shaped human. Four-Forty-Five smiled widely and bent down to hug Alia. 



“You’re all right. The doctor says that you overheated from exertion while using Tartarus.”



“That’s right,” The doctor said. Alia had noticed that he also had a thick accent, like Viv. He must be using translation softs as well. “It has been centuries since their use, but the records tell me that the enhancements that you have been supplied as part of Tartarus can only do so much. Periods of extended exertion - or short bursts of extreme exertion - will cause overheating. For now, rest and fluids are all you need, but if you are to be using Tartarus more, we must look into some kind of… cooling solution. Perhaps a radiator, or a coolant vent.”



“Radiator?” Alia said aloud, imaging herself with a fin or something sticking out of her head. “No radiator. We can come up with something else.”



Four-Forty-Five laughed. “You’d look good with fins,” she said and sat on the bed next to Alia as the doctor packed up. “You wouldn’t be the first of us with physical mods either. There was a fashion in the mid two hundreds to have body modifications.” She looked away and was lost in thought for a moment. “Come to think of it, that was the last time Tartarus was popular. It was… a dark time for us. Perhaps the modifications popular with the two hundreds were more than cosmetic.”



“You’re sure I’ll be all right, doctor?” Alia asked.



He nodded vigorously, “Oh yes, you’re quite resilient. Like I said, rest and fluids.” The doctor stood straight, and then genuflected to them both. “Unless you need me further, I will leave you to your recuperation.”



Four-Forty-Five stood and regarded the doctor, taking a step towards him. Alia saw him stiffen as if he was preventing himself from taking a step back. “You have helped us greatly, and we do not forget when people assist us - especially when they do it quietly. Keep this up, and you’ll go far, doctor.”



The doctor nodded and genuflected again. “Of course, Eternal. With your permission I will conduct some research and determine a course of action for-” He gestured at Alia “-Eternal should she wish to pursue more cooling options.”



“That is an excellent idea. You shall have the access you require.” Four-Forty-Five looked up and an attendant rushed over. She whispered something to them, and they saluted sharply and led the doctor away.



After they left, Four-Forty-Five shrugged off the robe and crawled under the covers with Alia and snuggled against her, her body chilled compared to Alia’s. “I told you the bed was comfy.” She said, smiling. “I just wish you got the chance to try it out under more… pleasurable circumstances.”



It wasn’t so bad, Alia thought. It was a little odd to be cuddling up with herself, but they fit together well, maybe she would- wait. Alia sat up suddenly. “My crew. What’s happened to them? They need to know I’m all right.”



“They’re fine.” Four-Forty-Five yawned. “They are in my spare rooms, sleeping. After you had passed out, I called for the doctor and explained to them what had happened. Showing them the body of the assassin was an excellent way to gain their trust. They know you are resting and are all right. The hour is late. Let’s just sleep now, and in the morning you can check in with them.” Four-Forty-Five snuggled in deeper, and not a minute later, Alia could feel her breathing slow and become regular, falling completely asleep. Alia laid awake in the dark of the room staring up at the ceiling. The adrenaline she received when she was worried about her crew dissipated slowly. The warmth of Four-Forty-Five and her regular breathing was relaxing, and eventually Alia fell into a dreamless sleep.



The next morning, Alia awoke in an empty bed. She sat up - she was also naked, how did she not notice that last night?- and folded neatly at the foot of the bed were another set of clothes. Alia stood and stretched and then pulled them on. For a fleeting moment, Alia wondered how they got her size exactly right and then laughed at herself. Of course they’d know Alia’s size. The outfit was nice. It was just a simple shirt and pants in a soft fabric, with bits of gold piping along the seams. She slipped on a pair of slippers next to the bed and padded out into the room.



She found her crew seated in a dining room off the main entrance, eating breakfast. Yel was the first to notice her, and raised an eyebrow at Alia’s clothes, but said nothing. “Glad to see you’re up and about, Cap.” She said. “Food is good, but I’d expect nothing else for the Eternal. Come eat.”



Alia made her way over and took the seat at the head of the table. Immediately, stewards appeared from behind doors and placed a plate, cups, silverware, and napkins while another poured coffee and a third placed fruit and a pastry on her plate. Alia didn’t recognize the fruit, but the coffee was still coffee. The fruit was cold and sweet and had just the right amount of bite, perfectly ripe. She couldn’t remember the last time she ate food that wasn’t a meal bar and this might could very well be the best thing she had ever eaten. She was lost in the taste and texture of the food and slowly heard Bric calling her name.



“Cap? Hello, Cap? Twenty-Seven? Are you all right?” He said.



“Oh! Yes, I’m fine Bric, thank you. I was just… enjoying my breakfast. I can’t remember the last time I ate food that wasn’t in bar form.”



“She’s probably also recovering from last night.” Elia said, and Yel elbowed her. “Hey! I meant the assassination attempt.” She said, frowning.



“Sure you did, hon. You’re a terrible liar.” Yel said.



“I… passed out after Tartarus engaged. The doctor said I overexerted myself and overheated. Four-Forty-Five put me in her bed and I… we… slept there last night.” Alia said. “Nothing happened.” She added, and blushed slightly.



“You’re the Eternal” Ben said, spearing another piece of fruit with his fork. “We aren’t going to judge.”



“Anyway.” Bric said, side-eyeing Ben, “Four-Forty-Five invited us up to Command. She wants to know where we think James is, and we’re going to go over there. After, she’s going to give you Tontine.”



“That is, so long as you still want it.” Four-Forty-Five said, as she walked in. Everyone - except Alia - stood as soon as she stepped in, but she gestured lightly and they all sat back down. Eternal was dressed in a white uniform with gold trim, cut in a similar way to a military uniform. She had gold epaulettes and Alia noticed a sidearm on her hip. 



“What about the rest of my Companions?” Alia said, as Four-Forty-Five came up along side her. She didn’t sit. “I still had nearly six hundred in hibernation in Mountain Memories.”



“They are valuable indeed. It has been a very long time since an Eternal had her own regime of Companions. They are yours, and you shall keep them. We have removed them from your gunship and are in the process of reviving them and… bringing them up to speed. They will be your team of troops aboard Tontine to use as you see fit. Recent… changes in the crew means there is more than enough room aboard for them.” Four-Forty-Five smiled slightly. “It won’t be crowded.”



Alia thought back to the crew being shot by the Mystics and suppressed a shudder.



“Before that though, we have two - three really - pieces of business. First, we are to null over to where James and Halcyon is hiding and remove that threat as a show of goodwill to the Anomoura. Then we will send a beacon and cenotaph to the remains of Greylock as it streaks through this system. It will warn anyone who comes across it that it is a memorial and sacred to us. Finally, we are to take up station around the Anomoura planet.”



“What are we going to do there?” Twenty-Seven asked. A steward appeared and went to refill her coffee cup, but Alia put her hand over it, and the steward disappeared.



Four-Forty-Five made a sour face. “We are to-” she sighed, “-await Eternity herself, Alia Five-Eighty-Seven.”



“You’re not Eternity?” Bric said, and as the words left his mouth, Alia noticed all of the attendants and stewards freeze. The words hung in the air, heavily. 



“Alia *is* Eternity.” Four-Forty-Five said after a moment and smiled thinly. Everyone around her took that as a sign, and continued their duties, resuming as if they had been paused. “Twenty-Seven is Eternity, I am Eternity, Five-Eighty-Seven is Eternity.” She is… the one who is in charge right now. I am Demi-Eternity when I’m around her.” She put her hands on her hips and regarded the companions. “Mystics, it’s been a while since I have been in the presence of people so willing to… ask questions.”



“I apologize, Eternity.” Bric said. “I… spoke without thinking.”



“It is all right, you did not know.” She said. “But, be aware that once we leave my palace, I am not normally… questioned. Speak with care, and do not speak to me unless I ask you something. I don’t particularly mind, but it is against protocol.” She was still smiling, but Alia saw the hardness in her eyes, “Failure to follow protocol leads to… chaos.” Moment over, her eyes softened again. “Come. Let us go to Command and find out what James and Halcyon are up to.” She gestured to Alia. “But first, you must get dressed.”



Alia followed Four-Forty-Five back to the bedrooms as everyone finished eating. In front of the bed were two attendants and another uniform like - but not exactly the same as -  Four-Forty-Five’s on a hangar. She inclined her head towards them, and Twenty-Seven went over.



“Arms out, please, Eternal.” One said. Alia complied and they stripped off her clothes. 



Four-Forty-Five apologized to Alia with her eyes as she stood there being undressed. “The Eternal is not afforded very much privacy, I’m afraid,” She said to Twenty-Seven. “You will get used to it after a while."" Measurements were taken, and alternations were made to the uniform, and Alia was dressed. The uniform fit her like she was grown into it, but even as she moved, the uniform moved with her, and did not feel constricting or binding. Instead of the pure white of Four-Forty-Fives, this one had a very slight yellow cast. They affixed the sash, and clipped the sidearm to her belt.



“It is part of the uniform.” Four-Forty-Five said to Alia as she locked eyes with her. Alia took out the pistol. It was very similar to the model she trained on so long ago back on Earth, and felt very familiar in her hands. Quickly she worked the action and a round popped out of the chamber. She caught it before it landed on the ground and pocketed it. Making the pistol safe, she put it back in her holster and looked up again at Four-Forty-Five.



Nodding once, she turned towards the stewards. “She *is* Eternal, do you not see? Continue the fitting.”



 It was a test? 



As they exited the palace, and met up with her companions, another pod settled onto the ground in front of them, and once again Four-Forty-Five entered and they followed behind her. This time, the ride was silent, and they arrived in a new section of the ship. 



This looked much more like what Alia was expecting. Long halls, carpeted floors to muffle boots, and sliding pressure sealed doors. They strode down the halls and people moved aside, genuflecting as Four-Forty-Five and Twenty-Seven led, with Alia half a step behind. She wondered as she walked if she could move ahead and if anyone would say anything - she was an original after all - but she assumed that if she did that, Four-Forty-Five would be cross in the bedroom tonight. She did entertain the thought for just a few moments though, and was warmed by the feeling. 



Central Command for *Alternative Solution* was titanic. Almost more like an auditorium than a command deck, it was bustling with activity, with people everywhere. Four-Forty-Five walked to the rear of the room, and a large ornate chair rose out of the floor to meet her. She stepped in, and the lights in the room flared briefly. The chair rose even higher until she was maybe a meter off the floor with a golden dais rising along with the chair. Four-Forty-Five looked down at Alia from the chair, imposing and beautiful. She caught Alias eye and almost quicker than she could notice, she winked. Then, she stood, and got down. “Eternal, who was Lost and now is Found, please.” She gestured to the chair. “Lead us.”

I’m having a really hard time with this and I feel I have nowhere else to turn.
This is going to be a long one.
TW: alcohol abuse, death, child abuse.

My(20F) mom (50F) got a boyfriend about 3.5 years ago. Let’s call him Jim(49m). Jim seems like a really nice guy. Takes her out on dates all the time, is funny, and pretty respectful. I love to see this as my mom has had a very bad track record with men. Let me elaborate.

Husband #1/My father: a narcissist, and extremely controlling man. Cheated on my mother so many times, and even brought my brother (now 31M) to dates with other women when he was a little kid.

Husband #2: A drunk, and angry man. Threw me across the room multiple times when his hunting trips were unsuccessful (Never in front of my mother), and when I would tell her, he would convince her I was lying. She finally divorced him the moment she saw it for herself when I was walking outside, tossing a volleyball hand to hand, and I dropped it. He yelled at me for not being careful and tried to take it from me. I refused, and he threw me ever the side of the couch where I hit my head really hard on the coffee table.

Boyfriend/man #3: after multiple years of no one new, she met this guy at a bar. Let’s call him Adam(30M). Adam was a very nice man when I met him for the first time. My mom became a lot more easygoing and happy. About 2 months after they started dating, she picked me up from my after school job at 15 years old, and informed me she was pregnant. I was enraged. My brother and I both had terrible childhoods, and both have agreed since we were young that we should have never been born. Our parents simply did not have their priorities straight and we suffered through growing up. And after two months?? WTF?! I asked her what method of contraception she was using, and she flat out said “the pull out method”. I was enraged but told her calmly that I would be there for her, but I didn’t believe this was the right thing for her. Cruel to the outside ears, but if you were in mine or my brother’s shoes, you would agree.
Soon thereafter, after quitting my job to help take care of everything she may need help with, being high risk due to age, she miscarried. She blamed me and my brother, and our family relationship deteriorated. Adam started drinking more and more. Eventually, he also became abusive. Once cops were called because he ripped out a chunk of my hair after I yelled at him for turning off the light on me while cleaning my room 12 times. The first 11 I ignored him because I thought he would leave me alone, and then I snapped. I called my brother crying because I was scared, and he called the police. The police told me that essentially because I was truant in school, (due to child abuse!) I was considered a delinquent and if they were called to my house again, I would go to juvie. Disgusting. For the sake of efficiency, I’m going to just list his gradual downfall.
- he informed us he was dying of an inoperable brain tumor
-I started finding whiskey bottles everywhere and he was now constantly drunk beginning before I was even awake at 7 AM.

-he started pissing in my shower.

-he started pissing himself.

-he collapsed, I called 911, and he was taken to the ER. We were told he was 9x the legal alcohol limit. He hated me for calling.

-his epileptic grand maul seizures began happening every other day. He would call my name for help, I would keep him from choking on puke and swallowing his tongue, he would wake up, and scream at me for touching him.

-after working an 11 hour McDonald’s shift, I came home and went to bed. My mom comes running in at 3AM saying “did you tell Adam you were going to call the police and say he touched you” I said absolutely not. I just want to go to bed. She said “I didn’t think so.”- she was over him at this point. She kicked him out the next morning. A day later, he was found by hotel staff passed out, and yellow in a hot tub.

-on his death bed he asked to see me and apologize. I refused. Then, he died. 
We asked the doctor if the brain tumor was really inoperable. This will forever be ingrained in my memory. The doctor said, “what tumor? This was alcoholism”.

He had lied to us the entire time. 


Time went on and we began to heal. She met another guy, dated briefly, broke up, and started dating jim.
Again, super nice guy, he has a daughter, let’s call her Eva(now 17F) that lived with his parents. Then I started to get nervous. He was drinking every single time I saw him. I had moved out and didn’t see him often. My mom informed me they were moving to buttfuck nowhere North Dakota for his job temporarily. I was pissed, I had just moved out and I needed my mom. Selfish, I know. He also has a daughter that needs him. Whatever. Not my circus. 
Then, last summer, she tells me she wants to sell her house to move in with him. TERRIBLE IDEA. It’s in our city which has tripled in size over the last 10 years. She would never be able to afford a new one. What about retirement? Backup plan? They’re not married, he can easily leave her with nothing. My brother and I both know the risks are high and tried to convince her to just keep it for a while. No dice. 

I came over to retrieve the rest of my stuff, and to help clean, and prep for her move. My mom, Adam, and her friend (who had a newborn) were supposed to be there to help. When I get there, it’s only my mom and her friend. I ask where Adam is, and my mom says she doesn’t know. She sent him across the street with his friend to get nails 3 hours ago.

 Rage rage FUCKING RAGE. She is uprooting her life for him and he can’t even help her? It was the whole reason for a 6 hour trip home. Runs off? Nah. I hopped in my car, stopped at every hardware store in town and didn’t see him anywhere. 
Then, I checked the bar. He sat there wasted with his friends. I walked in there, and it was pretty slow. I told him to get up and get home. He made excuses, pitiful and barely able to stand I yelled at him about how he left when he had responsibilities; damaging relationships and his credibility. I felt like a mom dragging her kid by the ear. If no one else was going to be the bad guy, I was. 
We got home and went inside, I saw red. I lectured him for a half hour about dishonesty, how he made my mother feel, the fact her friend left his newborn baby to be there, etc. he got mad and left saying that I had no right. My mother and her friend openly disagreed with him. He said after, that i over stepped. And i need to “stay in my lane” and that he doesn’t have a problem.

Over the last 8 months, his alcoholism has become increasingly noticeable. I began trying to form a relationship with Eva since we barely knew each other. Big trauma bond energy there. She told me all about how his alcoholism has been an issue for years, and that that’s why she lives with her grandparents.
My mom has begun trying to restrict his drinking and it made a slight impact, but not much. I asked Eva if she had ever thought about an intervention. She didn’t know what that was so I explained it to her. Immediately she said yes. That’s exactly what he needs. He has burned every bridge because of his drinking, and she thinks it’s the only thing that might work.

The last event was truly the most frustrating in my eyes. My boyfriend and I are planning on getting engaged. Since my dad and eye do not have a good relationship, we decided he would ask my mom for permission instead. We asked her to lunch, he came with. It was so awkward. Within 45 minutes he knocked back 6 shots of whiskey and 2 beers. He became loud and rude. Saying not PC stuff that made me want to hide under the table.finally towards the end of lunch, my bf asked to have a moment with my mom. 
Jim and I go outside where we just sit and chat for a moment to pass the time. He brings up when I made him go back home to help clean and pack, and again tells me to stay in my lane.  At this point I’m irritated but I just shrug it off. He then says “screw this, I’m going to the bar I’m not going to wait”. He goes and orders 2 more shots and another beer. I walk up and just try to get their attention to leave. I mentioned the idea of an intervention to my mom and she immediately agreed before I could even finish my sentence.

He managed to ruin such an important moment for my boyfriend and I. I am honestly not sure I can forgive him for that. I’m also so incredibly worried this situation is going to go the same as Adam, which took my mom years to recover from. 
So Reddit… would I be the asshole if I ignored him and didn’t ‘stay in my lane’, and instead helped Eva set up an intervention even if it might destroy our relationships further?
Also, if anyone has any advice on how to do it, that would be amazing.

Hear my product ideas, scents so sweet!
I’ve got a proposition, a list to share,
For luscious fragrances beyond compare! (Post labelled as rant because this is how my delirious, sleep-deprived brain wants to express my discontent that these fragrances don't exist.)

First... WHITE CHOCOLATE PISTACHIO;
A nutty treat with creamy flow.
Silky rich, with butter cocoa,
A scent that’s sweet, yet smooth and deep,
You’ll want to smell it before you sleep!

Second is... SPICED CARROT CAKE, absolutely divine,
Allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, all entwine.
Carrots so sweet, they almost sing,
Frosted with vanilla and cream cheese, what a thing!
A dash of clove, a buttered kiss,
This cake of spice you’ll surely miss!

STRAWBERRY POUNDCAKE, it's your turn...
Soft and fluffy, butter added with a churn.
Berries ripe, with a yummy glaze,
A strawberry dream in a sugar haze.
Enchanting, dense, and fruity all around,
A cake so sweet, you’ll never frown!

CREAM TEA, it’s time to shine...
With lashings of honey on every dine.
Gentle tea leaves, perfection in a brew,
And dollops of thick cream, smooth and true.
This scent will calm, it’s peaceful and soul-nutritious,
Like afternoon tea, quite delicious!

...GINGERBREAD LATTE, let’s make it sweet,
With rich coffee and a caramel treat.
Espresso beans that warm your heart,
Dashed with spices, it’s pure art.
A tasty scent, smooth yet bold,
A morning delight you’d even want to drink cold! (disclaimer: as tempting as it is, please don't drink lush products)

Last, but not least, CHOCOLATE ORANGE... what a hoot!
Dark chocolate with citrus to boot!
Zesty orange and choco swirl,
A scent that’s as sweet as a Viennese whirl.
But it's also rich and tangy, it’s got quite the punch,
A burst of joy in every crunch! (Note, I'm not sure how we add crunch to a fragrance but you get the idea)

So, Lush, please take these scents and make them real!
Bring this exhausted girl's dream to life, can we make a deal!?
Add some sugar and spice, with love in tow,
These fragrant treats are sure to glow! (And by glow, I mean make you a lot lot LOT of money, pleeeease 🥺)",1,1739793897.0,LushCosmetics,0,1.0,False

Would anyone have any recommendations of nice areas to start looking at please? I don't want to spend more than £300k if possible but appreciate times are tough!!

Today, we open the sixth and concluding section, “The Pride of Leading a Life of Unsurpassed Value.”

Sensei starts: “And I am confident that the valiant struggles of our members since the pioneering days of our movement are actions that carry on the humanistic legacy of the Lotus Sutra.” Yesterday’s discussion meeting was a gathering of good friends–but, according to this sentence, we were also carrying on the humanistic legacy of the Lotus Sutra.

The weather was so terrible, solid rain that gave way to thick fog. The only safe way to go was by our school bus and even then we–Dee and I, no kids–were traveling with blinking lights about 10mph. We even missed the entrance to the trailer park. None of the other members came, not even Jack who *never* misses a meeting. Veera’s sister “Tasha” was visiting from Germany so we were a small and intimate group. John was taking care of Charlie and Mikey in the back room; we were ladies talking at a meeting celebrating SGI women. 

I think it is interesting that in this section Sensei is reminiscing about his first meeting with Toda Sensei: 

>On the evening of August 14, 1947, some 60 years ago, I first met second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda at a discussion meeting in the Kojiya area of Kamata in Tokyo. The man who was to become my mentor was 47 at the time, and I was 19. When I entered the room on that fateful day, Mr. Toda was giving a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin’s treatise “On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land.” He declared: “I want to rid the world of all suffering and misery. Won’t you join me?” That was the first time I heard him speak. I believe his words were also a cry heralding the dawn of a great new people’s movement. 

“A great new people’s movement”: Emily, Veera, Tasha, Dee, and me. Who needed a meeting plan? We did Gongyo and just talked. Tasha–whose Gongyo is quite strong now–owns a small coffee shop where she bakes her own pastries and serves a daily soup and platter dish. She talked about the rabid anti-immigrant climate back where she lives. Her husband is native German, she speaks the language fluently, her kids were born there. But still she feels scared walking down the street to open her shop in the morning.

Emily and Veera talked very openly about living in a blended family. Emily spoke about the challenges of being the “platonic life partner (PLP).” The boys were in the back room so I had no problem sharing my story with  hypersexuality and my recent breakthroughs. Honest questions, grown-up words. What had made me so convinced that people could not comprehend what I have been dealing with for 20 years?

Dee defaulted to our “central figure.” But let me toggle back to Sensei’s lecture:

>On that day, I asked him what was the true way of life for a human being. President Toda’s response was entirely free of any intellectual game-playing or deceit. Each of his answers shone with genuine humanity. He was truly a person grounded in the Lotus Sutra and had risen above the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness and death.

Hmmm. “Risen above the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness and death.” That is graphic in terms of dimension and description! Is it even doable? For me?

I know that Dee had prepared very hard for this meeting. Her *Living Buddhism* was full of post-its and highlighting. But people wanted to talk. I knew, of course, that Veera and John had lost their baby daughter. Now she opened up (I have her permission to write this) and the tears that had been hiding beneath her serene and controlled veil came out.

Dee talked about the losses of many of her friends in Gaza, Israel, Ukraine, and Russia. She spoke about the pain of being outcasted by her own community for several years and the history of loss and defeat experienced by her people over centuries. This is pretty close to what she said:

>We can’t control most of the horrific things that happen to us. President Toda had lost his two-year-old daughter, Ikeda Sensei had lost a brother during the war and a son many years later. The only thing we can control is how we live in the present moment. She talked about Mr. Makiguchi in prison during the war. The prosecutor had begged him to “just sign the damned confession and walk out of this hell hole.” President Makiguchi, however, felt that the entire future of Nichiren Buddhism lay in him taking a stand and not caving in. In short, he was planting a seed with the knowledge that he would never live to see it bear fruit. Sometimes we have to sow seeds without knowing how they will harvest. But if we crack this tough shell, even the slightest, then everything gets flooded by brilliant light–including past, present, and future.

Emotionally Dee is very reserved, even with her partners. But now her tough shell cracked. She talked about how unbelievably happy and fulfilled she is now. All of those haunts from the past have turned into her personal cheerleaders and bodyguards. And with that spirit she sails into the future.

Within an hour the five of us were transformed into eternal sisters. By the end of the meeting the fog had lifted and we looked so silly driving home in a school bus.

Let’s conclude with this paragraph:

>That day marked the start of my journey of shared commitment with my mentor. Mr. Toda taught me about the true nature of life and death. And as time went by, I felt it was my duty as a disciple to clarify and show actual proof of overcoming the sufferings of birth and death.

1iri8z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmostFine/comments/1iri8z7/unfiltered_reality/,Unfiltered Reality,"I’ll be sure to paint a picture for you. Imagine living in your car, a car that barely starts, with a battery that could give out any minute and an oil change you can’t afford. You’re supposed to be a college student—online, of course, because who has the luxury of going to campus when they live in their car? Oh, and did I mention the broken heater? That’s fun in the dead of winter, by the way. But hey, you’ve got a 3.84 GPA, so that’s something, right? Except… it’s not. Because every time you get a small win, the universe smacks you back down like a toddler throwing a tantrum.
I’m in rehab right now—not because I’ve used recently, but because I felt myself slipping. You know, that moment when you realize you’re about to spiral into old, familiar chaos, and you make a split-second decision to get help before you end up doing something you’ll regret. Rehab feels like a sick joke, though. It’s like, “Hey, here’s some support, but also, good luck finding housing, food, or anything resembling a normal life when you’re homeless and applying for jobs that you can’t get because your qualifications are ‘too much’ or your licenses are ‘too few.’”
I’m fighting ghosts here. My mom, my granny, my papa—they’re all gone. And the man I thought was my father? Turns out he’s not. After 30 years, he tells me I’m not his kid. So we don’t talk—not because I don’t want to, but because he doesn’t want to. Maybe he hoped I’d disappear along with the truth, but I’m still here. And guess what? I’m living in my car, so it’s not like I’ve gone anywhere.
I keep applying for jobs, but apparently, I’m either “too qualified” or “don’t have the right licenses.” Too qualified to flip burgers but not qualified enough to be anything other than a student in a system that won’t let me get a damn break. How am I supposed to get work when my “address” is the 2020 Chevy Impala, fresh from the “I just got this after my granny passed away in 2022” deal? It’s not luxury, it’s survival. But hey, at least it’s mine, right? Except... it’s not really a home. It’s more of a mobile prison with a front-row seat to the endless parade of frustration. Oh, and did I mention I can’t afford the oil change to even make it through an interview?
If someone asks me where I live, do I tell them the truth? “Well, I’ve got a really cozy spot in a car that smells like desperation, stale coffee, and maybe a bit of despair. It’s got a sweet view of the freeway and a front-row seat to my own breakdown.” Does that sound appealing? Yeah, I didn’t think so.
I don’t even know how to explain the constant cycle of rejection, but here’s the thing: at least rejection is consistent. Whether it’s the state denying me, help because I’m not a “priority” (apparently, being homeless and a student with no family isn’t a sob story worthy of compassion) or job after job telling me I’m “too qualified” for entry-level work, I know exactly how it’s going to go. No one wants to help someone like me because, well, I guess I’m not pitiful enough. I’m not an addict (anymore), I’m not a war vet, and I’m certainly not an innocent little lamb who needs saving. I’m just someone who’s stuck, who tries to claw my way out every day and keeps hitting a brick wall.
Some days, I look at the world and think, “Is this the joke I’m supposed to laugh at? Because I’m really starting to think it’s on me.” It’s like a sick game of “who can survive the longest in a dumpster fire,” and I’m starting to feel like I’m winning but, you know, in a really miserable, twisted way.
There’s this heavy weight in my chest—the kind you get when you realize the family you love isn’t here to help, the people you thought would have your back would rather pretend you don’t exist. The world wants you to break down so it can sit back, eat popcorn, and watch the show. But I keep going. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the last shred of pride, or perhaps it’s just sheer stupidity, but I can’t give up completely, even though every part of me wants to. It’s too hard, and honestly, I don’t even know if I’m stronger than my brokenness anymore.
But here I am, still fighting and trying to make it work in this mess of a life. Maybe it’s stupid to keep going when everything is stacked against me, but there’s this weird thing that keeps me going—maybe it’s pride, perhaps it’s stupidity, or maybe I’m just not ready to let the universe have the last laugh. Perhaps it’s because, deep down, I know I’m not done yet. I’m not the person I was, nor the person I’ll be when this chapter is over. I guess that’s the only hope I have left: that things will eventually change. Or maybe the joke’s on me, and I’m just too stubborn to stop playing along.
Either way, I’m still here. And I’ll be here tomorrow, too, trying again. Maybe that’s all any of us can do when life keeps laughing in our faces—keep going, even when it feels like it won’t ever stop hurting.
So yeah, this is my reality. Not asking for sympathy, not begging for help, just throwing my story out there for anyone else who might be going through their own version of this crapshow. Maybe we’re all just trying to survive the punchline.
Heather

P.S. Yeah, I know all about the “solutions” people throw at you—donating plasma, Salvation Army, the homeless shelter. But here’s the thing: I take night classes. I can’t be in a shelter because I’d lose my bed. One class starts at 11 pm, and the shelters kick you out during the day, so good luck with that. Donating plasma is off the table because my health is not in great shape. I’ve got surgery coming up, and my body’s already been through enough. Don’t even get me started on what it feels like to try to survive with chronic health problems on top of everything else.
It’s like no matter how hard I try to figure this mess out, and the system isn’t built for someone like me. It’s all just endless walls and doors that don’t open. You’re supposed to keep fighting, but when you don’t have the resources or strength to fight anymore, what’s left?

But hey, life keeps going, I guess. Even when it feels like the universe is just waiting for everything to break. People keep pushing, like they have no choice like there’s something noble about holding it all together. But here’s the thing—what happens when you stop pretending? When you let everything fall apart because sometimes that’s the only way to figure out what’s worth picking back up?
Sometimes, breaking is the real breakthrough. And maybe that’s the part no one talks about. You can’t keep pushing if you’re never willing to stop and break long enough to figure out what’s left.

any who as always

Someone please advise me what I can do.,"First, though naïve I believe in honor, brotherhood , loyalty, fidelity and until recently family. Mother was an lifelong alcoholic. You died almost 20 years ago. My father is a malignant narcissist something I only learned of very recently.  I worked for my father for about 6 years in the medical field after loosing my partner of 16 years. My father and I have always had a strained relationship and he has major boundary issues that I have been repeatedly affected by. When I was 17 in HS he signed the contract for my cell phone. I never planned on working for him nor did I have any aspirations in medicine. However, that’s where I found myself after separating from my partner of 16 years. During the time I was employed by him, we went on a work trip where he needed to give a presentation and his computer wasn’t working so he borrowed my laptop. I made him zoom partition, which is the extent of my digital knowledge instructed him to sign out and didn’t even have the password to it throughout my life I’ve tried to be one thing and that’s the dutiful I had always dreamed of him to see me as. This was back in 2019. A lifetime has gone by since then. Covid happened during which I needed to access based on my computer and in an effort to figure out was eating so much of my memory a friend help me open the partition and once it opened in front of me was 10 years of my father‘s emails I became instantly uncomfortable shut it and did my best to forget about it. Months went by and then I would go about my life as if they didn’t exist. However, upon opening the file, some things were impossible, not to see things of an illegal nature financial crimes, etc. I became super uncomfortable with this. Unbeknownst to me my father had signed himself into his work Internet so every time that I open my laptop, it would try to sign him back in making me appear to him. I was trying to gain access to his email. Nothing could be further from the truth. And this is coming from somebody whom spent every single family dinner for 12 years and I would be throwing up from anxiety before every meal. I’m not wanting to try to be the long blade of grass and I was taught in a very young age that it is cost prohibitive for me to attempt to stand up for myself. However, in this situation, I have nothing left and I’m so hopeful that someone out there can understand if I have ignorance or find me naïve. It’s because that’s the intentional place. I was supposed to be during the time of my employment with him. He would consistently throw me his keys in the morning and say hey man, would you mind go locking my car and wanting to be helpful every time asked, I did and brought him a coffee directly after. This one for about four or five years I was new to recovery and as it turns out instead of picking up the phone and asking, hey I’m seeing attempted sign in or anything of that nature he instead along the help of his girlfriend, hacked and cloned my cell phone, followed by my iCloud. I had extremely personal pictures and videos some of which are shameful. I found out that he has hacked my phone and he has shared theA found within with all of my coworkers patients his family, my family I haven’t been invited to a family celebration or holiday in over five years now. I don’t know how to prove what they’ve done but he’s used whatever this information was to disinherit and ostracized me from my family. I kept getting disconnected from my network and I knew I was being hacked. I just couldn’t figure out how it was happening I went to him for help. He enjoyed watching me chasing my own tail. It very closely cost me in my life. I have borderline personality disorder as a symptom of narcissistic abuse, and a component of that is suicidal ideation unfortunately, to my family those are weapons attempted to be used against them. I know how they did it. I know when they did it I know who was involved I know who knows certain information. I just don’t know how or what the process is to help. Prove this I’ve lost my family, my nieces, my nephew what do I do? I’m now out of a job. I have medical bills stacking up because I thought I had thyroid cancer. Thank God I don’t. However, I don’t have the bank account to be able to afford a lawsuit and his pockets are very deep and he has many lawyers. The levels of illegal that has transpired are immense. In addition this is abuse of the highest level after a lifetime of it, which you took from me the only parent that I actually cared for me Even if she was sick. I want to sue this man and put my family behind me. there’s a case for child abuse there’s a case for workplace maleficent there’s a case for hacking. There’s a case for HIPAA. I just need somebody with a heart. I’ve never taken any kindness that wasn’t paid. I’m about to lose my health insurance and my head’s going to some pretty dark places with as helpless as I feel. I’m humiliated. I have lost everything that I ever gave a shit about or got sober protect or keep House even manipulated into signing his will under false understandings. I don’t know if that means anything. I just know that it was done to some how control me. After the childhood I’ve had a unfortunately come out of it with complex PTSD, which, if anybody understands what that is, I can only describe it as the most painful and negatively impacting forms of psychological emotional abuse that you are incapable of articulating in a manner that doesn’t make you sound crazy. I already feel like a fucking moron. I mean, how does somebody not know that their own family doesn’t love them? If anybody reads this and sees something with saving please because I’m lost and this entire situation has put me in dangerous positions where I don’t have support or anybody checking on me. It’s my firm belief that they’re trying to push me to that end, I don’t know the value of the information that I saw or what to do with it. And my family, you could be anything you wanted as long as you weren’t queer or gay. I’m 44 years old and I’ve never really given myself the opportunity to find that that’s how afraid of them I have become. This happened in Washington DC and Maryland so to the community I ask you the most well educated and hard-working and underrepresented for help. The details would make you cringe. The man spend the last two years calling me his office Fluffer at work in front of patients. And then they laughed about it and told me I was crazy when I thought I was being hacked. This is my breaking point. I’ve never belonged anywhere, but I’m hoping there’s a community for me whatever I end up being. These people have psychologically beat me down and programmed me to be incapable of defending myself. I don’t know what my options are or who to seek. I believe that there is a more obligation that we have to our fellow man I believe in right over might have experienced profound neglect, and abuse, psychologically emotionally and physically. I also have about 15 years of supporting documentation psychological school evaluation. I just don’t know what I don’t know and that’s a lot and however, naïve I believe the person is supposed to see this will, and see the importance in stopping the cycle and getting some justice for those who couldn’t. Thank you for reading and I’m sorry if this was confusing, but that’s what complex PTSD is. You spend life confused. Call Josh for any typos, but I went through 12 schools in 12 years and I’m not an army brat. I’m extremely intelligent but emotionally  ill-equipped.

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it’s nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!

The moment Diane tore the bright pink wrapping paper and yellow ribbons from the box, the doll captured her full attention. Staring in wonder at the ragdoll, the young girl quickly hugged her mother. It was the same doll she had longed for at the downtown street market two weeks prior. At that time, it sat sad and neglected on a dusty shelf, with a torn limb and ratty clothes. Diane was irresistibly drawn to it; such a pretty doll shouldn’t have been left alone in such disrepair. Yet, she couldn't bring herself to ask her mother for it—money was tight after her mother’s surgery, and she was still treading carefully after her latest bout of mischief at school.





Her mother loved antiques, and Diane frequently accompanied her on hunts for timeless pieces. On that fateful day two weeks ago, Diane and her mother had found one particular treasure: a beautiful Victorian-style bedside table. In her mother's hands, even the shoddiest antiques gained a new luster. Diane watched the painstaking restoration process with awe.





“She’s beautiful,” the girl exclaimed, hugging her mother fiercely. “How did you know, Mom?”





“A mother knows, my dear. Happy birthday,” Vivian replied, planting a soft kiss on her daughter's chubby cheek. The girl beamed, tucking a stray wisp of mousy hair behind her ear.





“Well, those antiques won’t restore themselves!” Vivian smiled brightly. Her footsteps thudded heavily on the stairs, painfully reminding Diane of the accident that had changed so much. Burying those thoughts, she focused on the ragdoll again. The doll had red wool for hair, obsidian glass beads for eyes, and a red felt triangle for a nose. The torn limb was carefully sewn, showcasing her mother’s expert “barely there” stitching. Adorned in white silk pajamas and red-and-white striped bed socks, the doll exuded charm.





Clockwork dolls typically had gears and tiny oil stains on their dresses, sometimes emitting sporadic puffs of steam that added to their mass appeal. But this doll was different—a rare ragdoll from before the nuclear disaster and medical revolution.





“I’m going to call you Diane, just like me,” the girl announced. For a fleeting moment, the cotton stitches of the doll’s half-moon smile appeared to stretch wider. Perhaps it was just Diane’s imagination. “You seem happier now,” she murmured to the doll. For just an instant, she thought its glassy eyes shone a touch brighter in response.





Breakfast the next morning consisted of the usual cereal and hot milk at the kitchen table. Diane skipped towards the table, doll in hand, deftly placing it on a chair. Vivian smiled at the quaint sight of her daughter chatting animatedly with the doll, even offering it a bite of her cereal. The two soon grew inseparable, bringing comfort to Vivian, whose restoration work often required long hours.





While Vivian worked on a little Victorian hand mirror, the sudden crash startled her, nearly causing her to drop the fragile piece. Rushing into the kitchen, she discovered the source of the noise: a plate lay shattered across the floor, and Diane’s doll was discarded on the linoleum.





“Diane!”





The raggedy Ann’s head tilted slightly at the sound of the name. Vivian rubbed her eyes, her shoulder emitting a gentle hum of gears.





*Now the gears are making me see things,* she thought bitterly, recalling her opposition to the reconstruction using gears—her only option after the accident.





“Mom?”





“What happened here?” Vivian inquired, pointing to the broken plate and the discarded doll.





Diane blinked, her chubby cheeks reddening. “It slipped…” she admitted, grinding the toe of her shoe into the floor.





“Clean up your mess and go to bed. I still have work to do, and it’s late.” Vivian turned to leave but locked eyes with the doll for a moment. A chill crept down her spine.





Later that night, Vivian cracked Diane's bedroom door open. The soft glow from the steam lamp illuminated her daughter’s sleeping face. A round arm draped over the doll. Smiling gently, Vivian turned to leave, but her gaze fell on a scrap of paper on the floor. Though Diane was meticulous about keeping her room tidy, she also loved to draw. Assuming it was one of her drawings, Vivian quietly pocketed the paper. Leaning down, she kissed her daughter lightly and slipped out of the room.





Curiosity about the note stirred within her. Illuminating it with the steam lamp revealed a clumsy scrawl in red ink:





HELP ME!!





The gears in Vivian's shoulder tensed. It was probably just one of Diane's games. Dismissing it entirely, she crumpled the note and tossed it into the kitchen trash can. There was little time to entertain Diane's fanciful antics; a big auction for restored antiques was looming, and Vivian was pressed for time. Perhaps she would finally have enough to replace the hated gear in her shoulder with a higher-quality model. She was convinced it was poisoning her slowly—yet another common side effect of shoddy gear reconstruction by a backyard mechanic. Sighing heavily, she pushed the dark thoughts from her mind, focusing instead on the work ahead.





Screams tore through Vivian's sleep—distant, panicky cries laced with terror. With effort, she sat upright, realizing she had once again dozed off at her desk, bleary-eyed and covered in paint chips.





*The neighbors must be quarreling again.*





Then the screams grew louder and more desperate.





*Funny, they sound just like...*





“Diane!”





Vivian bolted from her desk and raced to her daughter's bedside. Diane was screaming in her sleep, blood covering her nose and staining the doll's pajamas and pillow.





“Diane!” Frantically, she shook her daughter’s shoulders. “Diane, wake up!”





The acrid, panicked scent filled the air. Long seconds passed before Diane awoke from her terror-filled sleep.





“Mom!” the girl yelped, leaping into Vivian's arms, her clammy little body shaking. All Vivian could do was console her daughter while she babbled incoherently. Once Diane calmed, Vivian inquired about the nightmare.





“I had a bad dream...” Diane admitted guiltily, her cheeks flushed.





Vivian sighed, wiping the dried blood from her daughter's nose. The nightmares and nosebleeds had been dormant for a long time. She should have expected their return, but Diane's therapist had assured them they were a thing of the past. Yet, Vivian knew they would never truly leave, a painful reminder from the gears in her shoulder.





“Do you want to tell me about your dream?” she asked, already aware it would revolve around the accident and her surgery.





Diane merely shook her head. Looking pale from lack of sleep, the girl felt around for her doll.





“Mom, did you see my doll? It was right here,” she lamented, indicating the empty space on her pillow.





“She must have fallen off the bed from all the excitement,” Vivian replied, stooping to retrieve the doll, only to discover it wasn't on the floor.





“There it is! But how did it get there?” Diane pointed to the door. Vivian's blood ran cold when she saw the doll slumped against the doorframe. She distinctly recalled that the doll had been next to Diane when she entered the room.





“Perhaps it was flung from the bed?” Vivian suggested as she picked it up. A brief inspection revealed the doll’s pajamas to be clean and crisp. Shaking her head, she dismissed it as her imagination acting up, perhaps a result of the adrenaline from waking to screams combined with the pressure of the upcoming auction. Ultimately, she retreated to her fail-safe excuse.





*These stupid gears are making me see things!*





Diane clutched her doll fiercely, while Vivian scrutinized the scene, half-expecting the doll to move. But it remained limp. Feeling foolish for having entertained the notion of the doll moving, she shoved the thought aside. A clean cover was drawn over the pillow, and Diane quickly fell asleep again.





Before sunrise, Vivian rose as usual to prepare breakfast. Bleary-eyed, she stumbled into the kitchen, struggling to shake off the lingering effects of last night’s terrifying events. The grinding pain in her shoulder reminded her of the need for maintenance—a dreadful thought that meant another visit to that infamous backyard mechanic-doctor.





*Just another excuse to poison my body.*





Dismissing the urgent need for maintenance, Vivian struck a match and lit a tea candle, placing it in the kettle’s hollow base. The attractive round kettle had a homely, rustic appearance. Soon, little turbines whirred, and steam poured from the spout. The comforting clicking of the turbines eased her nerves. What she needed now was a strong cup of coffee.





“Mom!”





Vivian glanced over her shoulder.





*Why would Diane be awake at this hour?*





Her daughter was nowhere in sight. Instead, the doll sat in Diane’s usual place. Its beady eyes seemed to regard Vivian closely, and she swore she saw a reddish gleam flicker in them, though it could have merely been a reflection from the orange lamplight.





“Diane?” Her voice trembled, barely a whisper. “Diane!” Panic seeped into her tone.





Just then, her daughter appeared in the kitchen. The frown on her face immediately vanished upon spotting the doll at the table.





“You found Diane! Thanks, Mom.” Excitedly, she rushed to claim her doll.





“Didn’t you put her on your chair earlier?” Vivian asked, a sense of trepidation rising in her chest.





“No, I was looking for her when you called me.” Diane’s big, innocent eyes did not lie. Vivian’s unease deepened when she noticed her daughter’s unusual attire—a puffy-sleeve lace dress with a black corset bodice. Her hair, tied in two low pigtails, framed her pale, porcelain face, while lips stained an impossible shade of red marred her pretty visage. This transformation diverged drastically from the girl’s usual preference for pants and a sweater.





“That’s a different look, dear.”





“Diane said I look pretty in this dress,” Diane replied, nodding toward the doll, who donned an identical outfit.





“Don’t I look pretty, Mommy?” two distinct voices chimed, sending blood racing from Vivian’s extremities. This was the final proof she needed: the gear in her shoulder was indeed poisoning her.





The gears in her shoulder hissed in protest to her growing mental blame, burning pain scorching her left shoulder and forcing her to the ground with a gasp.





“Mommy!” Diane cried, rushing to her mother's side. Vivian barely registered her daughter's frantic questions. Her gaze remained fixed on the doll, which had shifted slightly in the chair, now facing her entirely as though to ensure a clear view.





“I’m fine, Diane. Just the shoulder acting up again. It needs maintenance,” Vivian reassured her.





“I'll call the doctor-mechanic!” Diane exclaimed, darting out the door before Vivian could stop her. Blood trickled down Vivian's arm; a glance revealed the gear had torn through the skin.





“She’s mine now,” a whisper echoed in Vivian's ears.





“Who said that?”





“Mine, mine, mine! All mine!” the voice chimed repeatedly.





Vivian glanced around the kitchen, her heart racing with fear. No one else was present.





“Who is there?!” Panic warped Vivian's voice into a raspy squeal.





“You know who it is,” the voice taunted.





Locking eyes with the doll, Vivian watched as its cotton grin broadened. Beady eyes glowed with clarity—a sinister crimson hue. Little cotton arms reached out toward her as a singular utterance resonated within her mind...





“MINE!”

Sweets were something I could never resist before, before surgery I did learn to not overeat and to maintain a balance, I fixed my relationship with food before I started the process for this surgery because I wanted to do this right, I didn’t want to never eat certain foods because that’s just not sustainable for most people but I obviously didn’t want to eat the way I did before. I researched a lot before deciding to get it, read about everything so I knew it wasn’t odd for people’s taste buds to change.

Anyway so fast forward to a month post op and I’m excited to try small bites here and there of sweet things that wouldn’t upset my stomach, some sugar free ice cream, flavored yogurt, even some semi dark chocolate chips. 
And I hate it, I thought to myself that it could be because of that sugar free taste or something so I have some iced coffee I used to have every week and I couldn’t even swallow it. 
I know this is a good thing, I won’t go back to eating and drinking stuff that I used to, but I can’t help but mourn these flavors that I can’t enjoy again. 

While yes this makes a bit sad I also started seeing it as a new opportunity to try new things, find new flavors that make me feel safe, ones that will benefit more my health. Recently I made homemade frozen yogurt with just frozen strawberries and greek yogurt and I was so happy. 

Thank you for reading, if you went through something similar I’d love to hear it:D

It wasn’t a big deal I’ve let him crash on my couch plenty of times, and his girlfriend was over a lot too. His parents knew, and honestly, I was still trying to just *act normal* around him. Like I hadn’t seen what I saw. Like he was still just the quiet, sweet kid I’d always thought he was. But I know now that I wasn’t acting *normal* at all.

After that night, I kept my distance. I didn’t even realize I was doing it at first. I still let him come over, still made dinner for him when he visited, still laughed at his jokes. But something in me had changed, and I think he knew. I stopped teasing him as much. Stopped playfully ruffling his hair when he passed me. Stopped sitting next to him on the couch when we watched movies. It was subtle, but it was there. A space between us that I had put there Because deep down, I was afraid of him And now I’ll never get the chance to make up for that.

They fell asleep together on the couch that night. Nothing weird. Just curled up under a blanket, his head resting on her chest. I remember teasing them before I went to bed, forcing myself to sound normal. His girlfriend laughed. He just smiled at me like he always did calm, easy, like nothing in the world could bother him And then morning came. I woke up first, made some coffee, scrolled through my phone for a while. I figured I’d let them sleep in. But eventually, I went over to wake them up. His girlfriend was still lying there, her arms wrapped around him loosely, her fingers absentmindedly playing with his hair in her sleep. I called his name. He didn’t stir. I nudged his shoulder. Nothing.

I remember chuckling, thinking, ""*Damn, he really sleeps like a rock"".*

Then his girlfriend shifted a little, blinking sleepily. She mumbled something about being cold and moved to shake him awake. But the second her hand touched his face, she froze. I shook him harder. Called his name again. My stomach was twisting, this sick, heavy feeling crawling up my spine. His girlfriend sat up suddenly, panic flooding her face as she shook him harder.

I don’t even remember grabbing my phone, but suddenly I was dialing 911, my fingers numb, my voice shaking. His girlfriend was crying, running her hands through his hair, whispering his name over and over. But I knew. I think I knew the second I touched him.

He was gone. Just like that. No warning. No sign.

The paramedics came, but it was already too late. His parents showed up, and I’ll never forget the sound his mom made when she saw him. His dad just stood there, white as a sheet, his hands in fists at his sides. I couldn’t even look at them.

The paramedics said they’d have to do an autopsy. That sometimes, *these things just happen.* A heart condition no one knew about. An aneurysm. Something.

And now I have to just accept it? Just move on like this is something that makes sense? and you are telling me (38F) that he’s just *gone* like that at just 16?? And I have to live the rest of my life and enjoy it while he’s in a coffin??

After pulling undrinkable shots for a month before getting used to it - it delivers a great experience almost every pull, both in terms of espresso quality, and the joy of operating this lovely craftsmanship.

Only real downside for me is that I can’t really make espressos for everyone when having friends over. Even making 3 shots back-to-back takes some time and effort. This weak point is also its strongest point - when me and the machine get to spend some quality time together on our own, it’s pure relaxation and a great opportunity to clear my head.

This is just the beginning of a lifelong relationship.


For those interested in details; 
PROCESS
1. With current bean -14.5g coffee.
2. Lever hits the top after 7 seconds.
3. Hold it there for ~5 seconds or until it starts pouring.
4. Gently press down to eventually bottom out at ~40 seconds with 35-40g espresso in the cup.
5. Drink while hot!
Disclaimer: Obviously I have lots of room for improvements after just one year, but the shots are coming out great!

GRINDER
The manual grinder is a Kingrinder K6, which is fantastic at its job. A double shot takes ~40 seconds to grind. I set it between approximately 29-34 depending on the bean. Do note that each individual grinder has some variation, my specimen bottoms out at -5. 

OTHER EQUIPMENT
I use a bottomless filter with a double basket, in which I run 14.5g coffee with the current bean.
My current tamper is 51.4mm, for me it was a huge improvement over my previous 51.0mm tamper.
I have a stainless puck screen which I always use. I do recommend it since it saves me from cleaning the head. Furthermore, it potentially prevents channeling.

If I answered off the top of my head a week ago I’d be leaning SF pretty comfortably. Weather, food/coffee, beaches and nature etc. But ironically I’m actually starting to lean DC for the following reasons:

- family with a small baby - not getting out heaps, a nice and spacious rental house will be very important 
- equally important is safety and a family friendly / affluent neighbourhood reasonably close to work 
-  the point of going over will be to maximise the financial gain so I don’t want to blow all our earnings on a rental in SF.

We are Australian, coffee and food snobs. So a little unsure about whether DC will stack up in that regard and also with the weather (home also a little more accessible from SF). But my gut feel with the baby and wanting to save some real money that DC is much more sensible?

My ex dumped me out of the blue exactly two years ago, I reached out once two months later, texted her that I wanted to grab a coffee with her, she declined and that's it. She never contacted me whatsoever.

 We were on good terms during the relationship and never expressed anything that showed me that she was gonna dump me. She just said ""I love you but I'm not in love with you anymore"" and completely disappeared. Two years. The only thing that hurts more than somebody dumping you out of the blue, is them never showing even the slightest hint that you actually mattered at some point to them.

 I genuinely expected that she eventually would contact me back to send at least some sort of text ""hey how are you doing, I'm sorry I left you that way but I wasn't in a good place in my life, you didn't deserve that"" or something like that.

I guess I'm delusional and naive, and some people are just...manipulative, not genuine and straight up cruel ? Like for real ?

The correct furniture selections may create a warm, inviting, and fashionable atmosphere whether you are remodeling your current house or moving into a new one. Many homeowners now prefer to buy furniture online from reputable furniture companies in order to easily improve their homes due to the ease of purchasing. With well chosen items from a trustworthy online furniture store or a local furniture store, you may completely revamp your home, from the living room to the bedroom. We'll look at how furniture affects interior design, improves usability, and creates a cozy atmosphere in this blog.

How Furniture Defines Your Home’s Personality

Furniture is one of the main components that determine a home's individuality, and every home has a story to tell. Regardless of your preference for a luxurious, ornamental design or a minimalist approach, the furniture you select will represent your taste and way of life. Warmth emanates from a well-furnished home, making it cozy for both guests and occupants. You may design a house that reflects your style while guaranteeing longevity and classic appeal by choosing high-quality pieces from furniture stores near you.

Living Room: The Heart of Hospitality

The living room, where families congregate, visitors are amused, and memories are made, is frequently seen as the center of the house. Setting the tone for a friendly atmosphere in this room requires careful furniture selection. A well-designed living space must have a cozy sofa, a sophisticated coffee table, chic chairs, and useful storage units.

Consider spending money on a premium sofa that provides comfort and style while perusing an internet furniture retailer. Modular seating arrangements, sectional sofas, and recliners offer versatility while enhancing the room's coziness. Adding beautiful side tables and a statement coffee table to the seating improves both appearance and usability.

Bedroom: A Cozy Place

Having the correct furniture is essential to creating a peaceful and relaxing space in your bedroom. A beautiful wardrobe, a comfy bed with a high-quality mattress, and useful bedside tables guarantee both comfort and organization. Many people choose to purchase bedroom furniture online in order to have access to a greater variety of styles and materials.

A well-designed bedroom also incorporates home decor components that provide warmth and style, like drapes, rugs, and soft lighting. Give top priority to ergonomic bedroom furniture designs that promote proper posture and a good night's sleep.

Dining Area: Strengthening Bonds During Meals

Another essential component of a warm house is the dining room, where families gather to eat and chat. Mealtime is made a treasured occasion with a solid dining table and cozy chairs that create a welcoming atmosphere. Choosing the appropriate furniture from furniture stores guarantees both style and longevity, regardless of your preference for a modern glass-top design or a traditional hardwood table.

Compact breakfast nooks or extendable dining tables are useful options for tiny areas. To improve the eating experience, think about adding chic china, attractive placemats, and a dramatic chandelier to the room.

Home Office: Combining Comfort and Productivity

Having a dedicated home office space is crucial as remote work gains popularity. An ergonomic chair, a roomy desk, and effective storage options are all essential components of a well-furnished home office that is both practical and motivating. Look for ergonomic office furniture that encourages comfort and boosts productivity when you're looking for a furniture store nearby.

To keep the workspace clutter-free, floating shelves, filing cabinets, and modular bookshelves are excellent additions. A tranquil yet polished ambiance can be further achieved by adding indoor plants and selecting a relaxing color scheme.

Furniture for Outdoor Spaces: Expanding the Welcome Outside

With the correct furnishings, outside areas like patios, balconies, and gardens may be turned into cozy havens. The allure of these spaces is increased by making an investment in weatherproof outdoor couches, coffee tables, and lounge chairs. A variety of outdoor furniture that blends strength and style is available at many furniture retailers in my area.

Add outside rugs, couches, and string lights to create a cozy atmosphere for an added sense of comfort. Well-chosen outdoor furniture enhances the coziness and functionality of your house, whether you're having a cookout or just spending a peaceful evening.

Storage Options: Blending Function and Design

Effective storage options contribute to the upkeep of a neat and friendly environment, and a clutter-free house feels instantly more welcoming. Storage choices are easily incorporated into contemporary furniture designs, from multipurpose wardrobes and wall-mounted shelves to ottomans with concealed compartments.

Space-saving designs that complement the style of your house should be given first priority when purchasing storage furniture from an online furniture retailer. Smart storage options improve the entire atmosphere of your house by keeping daily necessities close at hand and looking nice and orderly.

Why Buy Furniture Online?

More homeowners choose to purchase furniture online rather than visit several physical locations because of the ease of online buying. Finding the ideal items for your house is made easier by the wide range of styles, materials, and price points that online furniture merchants offer. The following are some advantages of purchasing furniture online:

Broad Selection: Online furniture retailers offer a vast array of designs, ranging from traditional to modern styles.

Price Comparisons: You may quickly compare costs and take advantage of savings that might not be found in nearby retailers.

Home Delivery: Take advantage of home delivery, which eliminates the inconvenience of transportation.

Customer reviews: Learn from past customers' experiences to make wise purchases.

Options for Customization: A few internet merchants provide furnishings that can be altered to your specifications.

To guarantee a flawless online shopping experience, carefully verify the product's dimensions, materials, and warranty details.

Finding the Best Furniture Stores Near Me

If you would rather look at furniture options in person, you can visit a furniture store nearby to get a personal look at the comfort, texture, and quality. To assist you in selecting the finest options for your house, a number of nearby furniture retailers provide professional advice and tailored suggestions.

Furthermore, several physical furniture businesses in my area offer customisation services that let you modify furniture to your exact needs. Whether you decide to purchase in-person or online, investing in high-quality furniture is a wise move if you want to create a warm and inviting space.

Conclusion: The Ideal Combination of Comfort and Style

More than just useful, furniture is a crucial component that creates a home's atmosphere. Selecting the appropriate furniture is crucial when creating a welcoming dining area, a peaceful bedroom, or a comfortable living room. Homeowners may now choose from a wide range of styles, materials, and price points to meet their needs thanks to the ease of Buy furniture online.

1irhmwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1irhmwr/lamictal_and_loss_of_appetite_and_pleasure/,lamictal and loss of appetite and pleasure,"I went through a really bad antidepressant induced mania last year and had to go off my zoloft cold turkey. I've  been on lamictal now for about three months now and I recently upped my dose to 100mg. I thought I was eating because I wanted to lose weight, but now I feel like I can't eat even if I wanted to.

I genuinely cannot have breakfast or lunch without feeling nauseas. I can only eat a light snack and some coffee so I don't get light headed. I do get hungry around night and sometimes crave particular food but I cannot even finish a regular portion by myself without feeling intense discomfort.

The problem is, I still very much like the idea of food but no longer gain the same pleasure or sense of fulfilment. In the past, I could binge eat insane amounts of portions at once, back-to-back. I wonder if it's because now that my medication is regulating my emotions, I no longer feel like using food to regulate them instead.

I feel the same way towards all forms of pleasure. I don't feel the constant need to listen to music or watch tv or consume any type of media really. and when I do, I feel bored. I also used to have meaningless sex a lot and now I feel disgusted in the idea of it and can't seem to date anyone without an emotional connection. I still have a sex drive but I genuinely cannot touch myself without feeling empty or wanting to cry(tmi).

Maybe I'm also sexually disgusted by myself and my body which is a part of why I don't want to eat.  I feel  uncomfortable in my skin. I still like myself as a person, more than before. I just finally have a sense of self-esteem for some reason and hate that I let myself get used even though I don't exactly blame myself for it because I know I wasn't in a healthy mindset back then.

I don't think these are necessarily bad things but I also just feel very out of it all the time. I'm basically isolating myself from everyone. I no longer have this desire to jump from relationship to relationship or from one friend group to another.

Maybe I was just distracting myself superficially from my true emotions and now I feel comfortable being myself and taking things slow for the first time. Before, the very notion of being alone distressed me so much that I would speed-run through people and over consume everything (food, alcohol, etc).

For a while I was really disgusted with myself for how I acted during my mania and even before. I think I came to terms with everything now and for the first time I feel like taking a more proactive role in my life instead of just coasting by which is very new to me.

My problem is I don't really where to start at this point and I feel like I'm still holding onto my old habits and the idea of things that once brought me comfort. I'm just super bored. I feel very stagnant instead of emotionally all over the place. I just feel like doing nothing but I'm also super uncomfortable with doing nothing.

Still I don't feel fully conscious in myself or my body and can't focus on anything which has been an issue for the past two years. I think my brain might be fried from all the meds and substances or I'm still coping with everything that happened and don't want to face reality. My head feels foggy all the time and I do have emotional outbursts every now and then.

Nothing brings me joy and people feel meaningless. I don't want anything to do with anyone and I'm not even bothered by it. So I don't know if the pills are working, or if they just regulated my emotions and I'm still majorly depressed. Maybe it requires more self work than just taking a few pills and hoping for the best??

I feel like everything I'm doing is just trying to get back the life I lost when I was sick. I also lost a lot of people when I needed support the most. I feel paralyzed with the possibility of making the wrong choices again and losing myself in the process. So opt to doing nothing instead though I am trying to try at least even if I have to force myself to plan my future. 

It  also took me so long to get properly diagnosed. For some reason every psychiatrist I have just wants to focus on BPD or CPTSD instead of my Bipolar and all we do is talk about my childhood. I'm so sick of just talking about stuff that I had no control over as a kid. I may have talked about it a million times. 

The problem was never that I was stuck in the past but that I had an emotionally abusive parent who would constantly bring up the past and would get violent if I didn't agree with them. Now that I fully cut them out, I think it's a disservice to myself to let it define me as a person. 

I feel like I'm more than what they did to me and deserve to move on. I've already accepted everything that happened between us and just want to desperately move on which doesn't mean I'm avoiding it. I just want them to stop having this invisible control over my life. 

I don't know why every mental health professional just brushes off my mania. What I wen through during that period of time was probably more emotionally upsetting than any form of abuse or violence I went through. Losing myself and having to come to terms with it has been so draining. And I never felt more alone. 

When I got off my antidepressants and my mania died down, I was hit with this wave of anxiety and depression and the air around me became heavier. I didn't fully understand what happened to me so If I ever brought it up implicitly people would visibly get uncomfortable. Everyone eventually faded  from my life because I was no longer this extreme, overconfident version of myself. 

It took me so long to understand what I went though instead of  avoiding it by holding onto a version of myself that no longer existed. And then everything else I did was a form of damage control and me overcompensating for all the embarrassing and shameless actives I did. I think i also went through a form of hypomania in after I got of my zoloft and was put on lamictal. I did a lot of extreme activities and maybe it was me trying to reclaim my past and body?

My current therapist tells me to move on from the past and that's not who I am anymore. This is all very new to me and I feel like I'm just processing everything that happened. She insists that I'm just more depressed and that lamictal should be enough but I'm genuinely terrified of losing control again. I wish we would talk more about that. 

Instead she wants me to play with blocks and explain my familial problems and I feel very undermined by her and the mental health system as a hole. I feel like my childhood trauma will always trump everything else in my life. I know it's a part of it but I also know there's more to me and what I went through than just it alone. 

I'm just tired of having to pick and put all the pieces back together myself. i no longer have this hope for anyone to validate my experiences but I also just feel incredibly cynical towards life and people. Maybe that's why I don't want to move on with my life or have ayone in it because everything feels so uncertain.

I don't even really know what this post is about tbh. I'm just very confused and stumped. I just wanted to vent. I ruminate about these events and go through every scenario with no clear resolution. In the end it's just all feels pointless to even mention. I doubt anyone would actually read all of this since it's all over the place and has nothing to do with the title, but still.

1irhm4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/tokyoirl/comments/1irhm4j/anyone_interested_in_starting_a_cars_coffee/,🚗☕ Anyone Interested in starting a Cars & Coffee Meet-Up in Tokyo?,"Hey everyone,

I was wondering if there are any fellow car enthusiasts in Tokyo who’d be interested in an **informal Cars & Coffee-style gathering:** nothing too structured, just an easygoing meetup at rotating locations in/around Tokyo, to talk cars over coffee and maybe go for a scenic drive afterward.

The idea is simple: **All cars, all drivers, all experience levels welcome:** whether you have a classic, a sports car, a daily driver, or just love talking about cars. If car-less people want to come over and grab coffee too, that's great but please don't solicit rides. 

At this point, I’m just seeing if there’s interest. If enough people are keen, we could figure out a weekly schedule. I am aware there is the Daikanyama t-site that organizes something almost every Sunday but this one could be for the international community.

Anyway, just an idea at this stage. Drop a comment if this sounds fun, and let’s see if we can get something going!

PS: Not sure if I've used the right flair...",1,1739791040.0,tokyoirl,5,0.67,False
1irhl9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1irhl9f/feedback_on_our_itinerary/,Feedback on our itinerary,"Hey everyone,

So we are planning a trip end of February and I put together this kind of rough itinerary. Just seeing if there is anything specific you would want suggest. It would be 5 of us, my wife, our kid under 5 years old, myself and also my parents (in 60s). So short hikes are ok.

We booked two seperate hotels, day 4 is when we would go to the new hotel in San Juan, leaves in an awkward spot because we wouldn't have a hotel for our stuff between 11am and 4pm. Any suggestions for day 4 and day 6 would be appreciated! Also any highly recommended places to eat let me know!


Day 1 - Wednesday 26 - Fly in
* Pick up car at and leave around 2:30
* Drive 30-45 min east to hotel in Luquillo. Possibly grab late lunch/early dinner at the kiosks less than 5 mins awayOK. 
* Rest of the day, do whatever. Can explore Farjado (just short drive east) or check out the beach (5 min walk)

Day 2 - Tuesday 27th - El Yunque Rainforest.
* Most attractions are off the road. 
* Juan Diego Falls is a short hike about 30 mins if we want to see it. There are areas where you can swim, and there is also a natural water slide.

Day 3 - Friday 28th - Flamenco Beach.
* We would take the ferry, it is about 45 min travel. Once we get to the island, we can take a shared taxi, rent a car, or golf cart.
* Main attraction is the beach, but can explore more if there is something else I am missing.
* Need to make it back to main island for Bio Bay tour.

Day 4 - Saturday March 1 - Flexible day. 
* We are moving hotels to go back into San Jaun Miaramar. We can explore San Juan. 
* There is also other stuff like Casa Bacari (rum tours)
* We could venture west as well, there is another cool beach. 
* We night want a relaxing day just because lots of walking next day in Old San Juan.

Day 5 - Sunday March 2 - Old San Juan - 
* There is a Walking Tour (my parents love walking tours). 
* There are 2 Forts here and lots of other interesting things like pigeon park and plenty of Pina Colada places.

Day 6 - Monday, March 3 - Flexible day. 
* Can do coffee tours (might need to be an early thing), especially if we want to go to central/west side.
* Could also do Cueva Ventana after coffee tours.

Day 7 - Tuesday - Fly back.",0,1739790943.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,0.33,False

1irhkf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1irhkf6/ive_been_dissociating_for_a_few_days_now/,I've been dissociating for a few days now.,"I'll try to make it a short post.

I'm 17 years old, I live with my father and brother, but I'm most of the time alone. My brother stays in his room for days and only comes out to eat, I've invited him to go for walks with me, but he most of the time doesn't join me. He is 19, and autistic (he isn't depressed, don't worry) and he still has no help for his autism. I'm not sure how to help him, I do what I can, but I get annoyed real quick (that's my personal issue, I'm quickly irritated). He doesn't clean his room and it stinks immensely. I've offered to clean his room for him, but he rejected, so I told him to clean it himself, but he doesn't.

My father is a teacher, he is gone throughout the week and in the evening he is home. He has been in a burnout in the past, so I try not to bother him to much with me trouble, but I often do go to him without even thinking about it.

I don't have a lot of contact with my mother, a lot happen between her and my brother en me in the past. And I don't have close friends.

I try to keep myself busy in the garden, or in the house. Cleaning mostly. I work at an animal shelter, but I'm not always enjoying it there, even though I try to.

I've been depressed for a long time, and I still am. I have hallucinations, sometimes worse then other times, but the last few days it has rapidly increased. It's gone wrong on my work before, when I was walking a dog. The dog was a big one, one that pulled often, so when I was having a ""panic attack"" (seeing and hearing more then I usually hallucinate) I wasn't paying much attention to him. Everything luckily went ""right"", but now I'm afraid that it will happen again and that things will go wrong. I should tell my ""boss"" (we don't really have a boss, just people who run the place and keep things organised) that I'm having this, but I'm afraid that they'll judge me. For now my solution is that I only walk the small dogs that are friendly and don't pull.

I've had therapy in the past, but I never got good help, and we're still searching for good help. I've also been dealing with harmful thoughts and behaviour, but I'm not going deep into that. I'm also quickly agitated, to the point of aggression. I don't hurt people, but my wall and stuffed animals often fall victim to my anger.

So, for the last few days I've been dissociating. My father says it's dissociating, so I'll just have to believe him.

My vision is blurry (to be honest, this could also be because I need glasses, but I've noticed that it's worse lately), I'm forgetting a lot. (Making mistakes in my work, like leaving a bucket of piss near the dog kennel, leaving my coffee upstairs where the birds are, etc) And I'm just forgetting a lot of other stuff, I'm quickly distracted. I'm also just not thinking. I'm not sure how to explain this, but I'm just reacting to things without thinking. And the world just doesn't feel real.

My body is also off. I'm shaking constantly, I'm nauseas, I have a constant headache, and I'm sweating even though it's cold.

My harmful thoughts and actions have increased, and I'm afraid that I'm going to lose myself soon.

The worst of this all is that I'm losing track of time. For example I'm walking outside at 10:00 and I get back home and realized it's now 12:00, even though I don't remember being outside for that long, just walking around a bit for what felt like 30 minutes. Or I would be sitting on the sofa and realize 10 minutes has past even though I just sat down. I know it sounds weird, but that's just what I'm experiencing.

Also, the voices in my head are more persistent. I don't want to talk about this for to much, I'm ashamed of my mental state, but I need to at least get a small part of my chest.

The visual hallucinations have increased as well. This morning I saw a shadow walk past the window, and when I looked through a saw a boy, second later the boy was gone, and he couldn't have just walked away in that time. I also just know that there is someone in my house, and I get panick attacks out of nowhere. I'm sort of paranoid and have my door locked when I'm inside. I don't trust my father and brother, I love them, I want to trust them, but I simply can't. I know I sound like an asshole, and I know I am one, my father does everything for me, and still I don't trust him.

I'm afraid, afraid of my future, afraid to fail, and afraid of humans and special myself. I want to keep working at the animal shelter, it's literally the only thing I have currently, but it's draining me so much. I cry everytime I come back from my work, and I have anxiety everytime I have to go to my work.

I don't know what to do, I'm lost. I still don't have therapy, and sometimes the only option seems to sleep forever. I have a tendency to quickly develop addictions, and I try to stay away from alcohol and drugs for that reason.

I'm tired, I'm sick, and I'm afraid. I'm sorry for the long post, and this is not the sort of stuff I post usually, but I needed to get this of my chest. Thanks for reading.",1,1739790854.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1irhjuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/1irhjuw/its_genuinely_easier_to_make_friends_with_the/,It's genuinely easier to make friends with the opposite sex,"I have been thinking about this a lot. As a socially isolated 19 year old guy it feels way harder to make friends with other dudes than it is to get social interaction from women. Not saying I have a big social life with women but it just happens more easily.

With guys there has to be some kind of justification to even start a friendship. You don’t just randomly meet a guy with no shared hobbies and decide to be mates. You don’t just take some random dude to dinner unless you already have a few friends and you are all hanging out as a group. One on one stuff is usually for close friends. You are not going to grab a coffee with some guy you sat next to in a uni lecture for 45 minutes if you have never met before. That would feel weird and forced. And the problem is you need to have friends to make friends. If you have no friends it is hard to make new ones because there is no casual way to get the ball rolling.

If there is no shared hobby or common ground I feel like it is a non starter. Maybe that is not actually true but for me I feel like a burden unless I bring something of value to the table. A skill a shared passion or at least a reason to interact beyond just existing near each other. Meanwhile with women there is already a built in shared hobby which is attraction.

And I am not saying I am just trying to sleep with every girl I talk to. Honestly I have come to enjoy when they use me for attention because at least it is something. I know what is happening. I can see when a girl is just keeping me around because she likes the attention. Back when I was a horny teen with plenty of male friends I used to ignore girls like that. I only cared about casual sex or an actual relationship and I would only get into a relationship after we had already hooked up.

Now I actually try to get girls to use me for attention. But instead of getting strung along I just acknowledge it early and turn it into an actual friendship. Not the we are just friends in a cop out I do not want to date you way but actually being friends. I always pretend I have a big social circle because I am scared of looking needy but the truth is I just want some kind of social interaction and this is the easiest way to get it. I do not even push things towards sex anymore. I only end up having it a few times a year when they initiate it. My goal is to just have a friend to talk to though. Back in high school I was hard selling my dong but now I just chill and I'm just tryna chat.

It might seem counterintuitive but as a lonely guy it is actually easier to get along with women and socialise with them because there is a built in shared interest. With other guys you need a legitimate reason to even start a friendship and if you have no friends it is hard to make new ones.",0,1739790788.0,nofriends,1,0.5,False
1irhjpb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irhjpb,Tisane * Nuremberg 14/02/24,"A Fantastic Chef’s Table Experience in Nuremberg

A truly outstanding Chef’s Table restaurant, made even better by a chef who is not only incredibly talented but also a fantastic host.

	•	Price: €210
	•	Wine pairing: €95

I received this dining experience as a Christmas gift and, in a stroke of genius, booked it for Valentine’s Day—great timing, right?

Personal Highlights:

From start to finish, the experience was exceptional.

Amuse-bouche: The evening kicked off with a wagyu brioche amuse, an absolute flavor bomb to set the tone.

Winter salad: A beautifully composed dish featuring a variety of seasonal vegetables—some fried—paired with a flavorful dressing and a refreshing beetroot sorbet.

Second course: Steamed black cabbage with beef ham and crispy black cabbage pieces, all brought together by a rich coffee beurre blanc.

Imperial pigeon: A standout dish, served with perfectly executed pigeon ravioli.

Dessert: Buchteln—soft, fluffy yeast dumplings—simple yet incredibly delicious. Served with maple syrup and a coconut-vanilla sauce, making for a perfect, comforting finish.

A solid one-star Michelin experience that I’d highly recommend if you’re ever in Nuremberg.",6,1739790767.0,finedining,0,0.88,False

Hey, fellow MaximizeMe enthusiasts!

Ever feel like your desk is the Bermuda Triangle of productivity? 😂 One minute you're reaching for a pen, and the next thing you know, you're knee-deep in stacks of paper and yesterday's coffee mugs. Been there? You're not alone. So, let's chat about how to transform that chaos into clarity and seriously amp up our productivity game.

**Why Organize?**  
First off, who doesn't love a good before-and-after story? An organized workspace isn't just about aesthetics—it's about creating a calm, distraction-free zone where ideas can flourish. Picture this: a desk where you can actually find your favorite pen without a frantic five-minute search. Glorious, right?

**Top Tips to Work Smarter, Not Harder:**

1. **Declutter like a Boss:**  
   Start with a clean slate. Remove everything from your desk and only put back what you absolutely need. That stack of old magazines? Do you really need them or do they secretly serve as a wobbly coffee coaster?

2. **Zone Out:**  
   Create specific zones for different tasks. Maybe a tech-free zone for brainstorming or a digital station for all things laptop-related. Think of it as real estate development... for your desk.

3. **Invest in Storage Solutions:**  
   Fancy folders, chic containers, or even those quirky drawer organizers can save you from the chaos. It’s amazing what a few strategic baskets can do for your sanity. Plus, organizing supplies are basically adult toys for us, right? 

4. **Cable Chaos No More:**  
   Those tangled cords behind your desk are not a new breed of office vines. Use cable clips or even bread ties to keep them in check. It’s a small touch that makes a world of difference.

5. **Weekly Reset Ritual:**  
   Set aside 10 minutes at the end of your week to reset your workspace. Trust me, it's like hitting the refresh button on your brain.

**Before we wrap up**, let’s just say organizing isn’t about being perfect; it's about making your life a little bit easier. Life's chaotic enough; your workspace doesn’t have to be.

So, what are some ways you've tried to conquer the desk mess? Or maybe you're still navigating through the paper jungle? Let’s hear about your journey, triumphs, or hilarious fails. After all, we're all in this together, right? 😊🔥",1,1739790343.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1irhfmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Moe-Nawaz/comments/1irhfmz/the_silent_edge_of_the_most_successful_leaders/,The Silent Edge of the Most Successful Leaders,"**The Power of Strategic Mentorship - Why 8- and 9-Figure CEOs Have a Trusted Guide to Scale, Exit, and Leave a Legacy**

  
At the highest levels of business, **there’s a pattern among the world’s most successful CEOs**—a quiet advantage that separates those who scale, exit, and leave a lasting impact from those who plateau, struggle, or burn out.

It’s not luck. It’s not working harder.

It’s something **far more strategic**—and those in the know already have it.

Behind closed doors, the best CEOs **have a strategic mentor in their corner**—a trusted advisor who **challenges their thinking, refines their strategy, and ensures every move is calculated for maximum impact**.

This isn’t about theory. It’s about **real-world execution**—the kind that determines whether a business scales to £250M+ or stalls at £50M.

The question isn’t **""Should you have a mentor?""** The real question is: **""Why don’t you have one yet?""**

# Why Every 8- and 9-Figure CEO Has a Strategic Mentor

It’s no coincidence that **the world’s top-performing business leaders all have a trusted advisor**.

Scaling beyond £10M isn’t about **grinding harder**—it’s about **thinking smarter, executing with precision, and avoiding the multi-million-pound mistakes that sink businesses before they reach their full potential**.

A **strategic mentor** isn’t a consultant. They don’t offer generic advice. **They provide high-level, battle-tested insights** that only come from decades of experience.

Here’s why every high-level CEO already has one:

# 1. Because at the Top, There’s No One to Challenge You

As a business scales, the **feedback loop gets distorted**. Employees, partners, even board members start **telling you what you want to hear** rather than what you **need to hear**.

A strategic mentor has no hidden agenda. They exist for **one purpose**—to give **unfiltered, high-stakes insight** that forces you to think bigger and **make better decisions before they become million-pound mistakes**.

Many CEOs believe they’re making great decisions—until a mentor exposes **blind spots they didn’t even know existed**.

# 2. Because Scaling Without Strategy is Just Controlled Chaos

Growing from £10M to £100M requires a **completely different approach** than going from £1M to £10M.

**More people. More complexity. More risk.**

Without the **right systems, structures, and strategy**, businesses hit a ceiling. They **grow in revenue but lose in efficiency, margins, and stability**.

Every CEO who scales past £50M+ **has already solved this problem with the right mentorship**—not by working harder, but by working **smarter**.

Those who don’t? They **stay stuck in the same cycles**, trying to scale with strategies that don’t work at their level.

# 3. Because Every Great CEO is Playing the Long Game

The best CEOs **don’t just think about this quarter**—they plan for **3, 5, 10 years ahead**.

The biggest mistake CEOs make? **Thinking they have time.**

* Time to **fix broken systems.**
* Time to **hire better talent.**
* Time to **plan their exit or legacy.**

In reality, **every strategic decision should have been made years earlier**. The CEOs who thrive are those who **get ahead of their own blind spots**—with a mentor who ensures they aren’t wasting **years making the wrong moves**.

# What High-Level Mentorship Really Looks Like

The best CEOs don’t need more information. They need **better decision-making frameworks**—and that’s exactly what high-level mentorship provides.

# What separates the CEOs who succeed?

✅ **They see market shifts before they happen.**

✅ **They scale without losing control.**

✅ **They structure deals that maximize exit value.**

✅ **They build legacies that last.**

They have **one thing in common**—they work with a strategic mentor behind the scenes who helps them execute **with precision**.

And those who don’t?

❌ **They miss opportunities because they’re stuck in daily operations.**

❌ **They scale with inefficiencies that cost millions.**

❌ **They struggle to exit, leaving money on the table.**

A great mentor ensures **you’re in the first category, not the second**.

# The CEOs Who Thrive Aren’t Smarter—They Just Have the Right Guide

Every CEO wants growth. **Only the best actually achieve it.**

The difference?

Those who win **don’t make decisions alone**—they have a trusted guide who ensures they’re thinking, executing, and **playing the long game at the highest level**.

If you’re running an 8- or 9-figure business, ask yourself:

* **Who’s in my corner—challenging me at the highest level?**
* **Am I leading with a clear, strategic plan, or am I just reacting to daily demands?**
* **If I had to exit my business tomorrow, would I maximize its full potential?**

**The best CEOs already have the answer.**

Do you?

# CEOs Who Play Solo Lose. Those Who Have a Strategic Mentor Win.

The CEOs who **scale, exit, and leave a lasting impact aren’t guessing.** They aren’t making moves based on **gut instinct alone.** They aren’t trying to **""figure it out"" as they go.**

They have **a strategic mentor in their corner—pushing them beyond their limits, exposing blind spots, and ensuring they make the right moves before it’s too late.**

And if you don’t have that yet, the real question is:

**How much is it costing you not to?**

1irhfjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1irhfjj/aita_for_avoiding_a_girl_at_my_university_that/,AITA for avoiding a girl at my university that wants to be friends,"There is this girl from my university that I started casually talking to out of politeness this year, but all of a sudden she went full blown bestie mode on me and I am not looking for that. 

I am a natural loner and like my alone time plus I don’t like the girl. She just gives me creepy vibes. When I go somewhere without her she texts me right away to ask where I went and constantly self invites herself into my life. I tried to be nice and give hints that I would rather keep my distance but she doesn’t seem to pick up the memo. 

It’s gotten to the point of me being stressed and planning where to sit so she doesn’t sit next to me and doesn’t end up coming with me on the lunch break. 

The problem is that I don’t like her as a person and she invades my personal space big time. I will give few examples:

1. She sits super close next to me during lectures and rewrites everything from me. She is constantly leaning towards me looking into my tablet and phone. I feel obligated to write everything the professor writes so she can rewrite it from me.  In the breaks if I’m on my phone she literally just stares into my phone.

2. She does things that make me want to throw up. Like drinking coffee drinks during lectures wicked laud and touching her face where she has acne and then lick it off her finger and then touch it again. This thing produces sounds that disturb me. I saw her eating something from her nose once. She doesn’t smell the nicest.

3. She is behind in studying but is always late for every single lecture including on exam days.

4. She has no comprehension for her abilities. For example on one exam she said she solved everything and even when one boy said he couldn’t solve everything she was like “Whyy? It was easy, I solved everything!”  She had F on that exam and had to retake it.

5. When I spend time helping her with studying she starts debating something and talks like an intellectual. 

6. She is not in best shape and health and constantly complains that something hurts her and that she doesn’t see but doesn’t go to the doctor to get glasses, doesn’t do any sports and drinks soft drinks and monsters (loudly next to me). When I try to tell her it’s good to do sports for her health she always has something to say like “I prefer to study” or that monster doesn’t affect her as bad as Coca Cola.

7. She doesn’t know English at all like even “peach” and stuff like that. In my country every single person our age knows English. It’s like almost being illiterate not knowing English unless you are over 35. But for the younger generation it’s not acceptable. 

8. She just emits desperation aura. Like it’s in her eyes and I can’t stand it. She acts helpless and like she needs me to help her and be her friend.

I told her straight “I prefer to be alone on the breaks” once. It doesn’t work. She doesn’t get it.

I told her “I can’t hang out after school because I am quite busy”. She still keeps asking me to hang out and even asked to come to my town on the weekends twice.

I walked out today after class and went my own way and she is texting me “Where are you?? I lost you!” 

I feel like a bad person and I probably am but at that point I don’t want this girl to talk to me sit to me or anything. I just want her to leave me alone. Am I overdoing it and AITA for my behavior towards her?

I've been working for the last 10 years  and so am pretty used to writing cover letters and my CV. But obviously the coffee industry is a more specific career and so I'm having to cater my cover letter to it, rather than having a basic retail/hospitality letter like I have used before. 

I think I've got something pretty solid, but I've never written a cover letter for any coffee industry jobs before and don't really have anyone to ask for advice. I work as a roastery assistant and am looking for another roastery job (hopefully a much better one...) 

I'm just looking for some general advice. Roastery managers, what do you like to see in a CV? What do you need to know about a person? 

I have a few years experience as a barista and thats where most of my skills and knowledge come from. So I'm very experienced with espresso, espresso machines and grinders, cafe work, latte art etc. I've been a supervisor and so have trained other people to make coffee and do latte art, which is also a plus. I'd say that's where my strengths lie. In my current job I've learnt to do cupping, but of course refining your pallet takes time. I've also started learning to brew on filter, and of course can roast. Unfortunately my current job only allows us to roast automatically, which is a big downside. I know some things about the theory behind manual roasting and I know about coffee, I just don't have experience of it. I'm also of course experienced with the warehouse side of the job, packing coffee bags, handling customer orders, knowing about trade customers, stock management, sending parcels out, etc

What do I need to really highlight in my cover letter? What is a given and doesn't need to he included? How do I best show that I'm passionate about working in the coffee industry and progressing in my career? ",1,1739790248.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False
1irhes1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canada_market_news/comments/1irhes1/why_do_businesses_in_mississauga_need_local_seo/,Why Do Businesses in Mississauga Need Local SEO to Stay Competitive?,"Mississauga is one of Canada’s fastest-growing business hubs. With a thriving economy and an increasing number of small and medium-sized businesses, competition is fierce. Whether you run a local café, a dental clinic, a real estate agency, or an e-commerce store, attracting local customers is key to sustained growth.

But in today’s digital-first world, word-of-mouth and traditional advertising aren’t enough. Consumers rely on search engines to find local services and businesses. This means if your business isn’t visible on Google, you’re losing customers to competitors who are.

This is where local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) comes in. A professional **SEO company in Mississauga** can help businesses improve their search engine rankings, attract nearby customers, and ultimately increase revenue. 

**But what exactly is local SEO, and why is it so important for your business?**

**1. What is Local SEO and Why Does It Matter?**

Local SEO focuses on optimizing your online presence to rank higher in search results for location-specific queries. Unlike traditional SEO, which targets a global or national audience, local SEO helps businesses attract nearby customers who are actively looking for their products or services.

Consider these search queries:

* Best coffee shop in Mississauga
* Emergency plumber near me
* Top-rated dentist in Mississauga
* **SEO company in Mississauga**

If your business isn’t ranking for these types of searches, you are missing out on potential customers who are ready to buy.

**Why Local SEO is More Important Than Ever?**

Growing Mobile Usage – Over 60% of local searches come from mobile devices, and Google prioritizes local results for users searching on smartphones.

Google’s Local Pack – Google prominently displays three local businesses at the top of search results. If your business isn’t in this 3-pack, you’re losing traffic.

Consumers Trust Local Searches – 76% of people who search for local businesses visit a store within 24 hours, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase.

**2. Key Benefits of Local SEO for Businesses in Mississauga**

1. Better Google Maps Visibility

When someone searches for a local business, Google Maps often appears at the top of search results. If your business has an optimized Google Business Profile (GBP), you have a higher chance of being featured in the Google Local Pack—the top three business listings displayed on Google Maps.

* More foot traffic for physical stores.
* Higher calls and inquiries for service-based businesses.
* Increased directions requests, leading to in-store visits.

**2. Higher Conversion Rates**

Local customers who search for businesses are ready to make a purchase. Unlike social media marketing, which often builds brand awareness, local SEO captures high-intent customers who are actively searching for what you offer.

* 46% of all Google searches are local.
* 78% of local searches lead to an in-store purchase.
* 92% of users choose businesses on the first page of search results.

When your business appears in local search results, you’re more likely to convert searches into customers.

3. Improved Mobile Search Performance

With more people using smartphones to search for businesses nearby, mobile optimization is a crucial part of local SEO.

An SEO company in Mississauga can help ensure:

* Your website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly.
* Your contact information is easily accessible.
* Your business appears in voice search results (e.g., “Hey Siri, find a pizza place near me”).

4. More Customer Reviews & Increased Trust

Online reviews play a crucial role in consumer decision-making. Over 88% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.

A well-optimized Google Business Profile encourages more customers to leave reviews, which helps:

* Improve your star rating and reputation.
* Build trust and credibility with potential customers.
* Increase click-through rates in search results.

**3. How an SEO Company in Mississauga Can Help**

Hiring an **SEO company in Mississauga** ensures that your business follows the best local SEO strategies to get maximum visibility. Here’s how they can help:

1. Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization

An SEO agency will:

* Claim and verify your business listing.
* Optimize business descriptions, categories, and keywords.
* Ensure accurate NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) details.
* Add high-quality photos, videos, and business updates.
* Monitor and respond to customer reviews.

2. Local Link Building

Backlinks from local directories, blogs, and news websites improve credibility and rankings. An SEO company can:

* Submit your business to local directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, and BBB.
* Partner with local influencers for collaborations.
* Get backlinks from relevant local websites to boost authority.

3. On-Page SEO for Local Keywords

SEO experts optimize your website for Mississauga-specific keywords, ensuring you rank for searches like:

* Best SEO company in Mississauga
* Affordable plumbers near me
* Mississauga digital marketing agency

4. Citation Management

Citations are online mentions of your business on directories, maps, and listings. An SEO company will:

* Ensure your business is listed consistently across platforms.
* Remove duplicate or incorrect listings.
* Improve local relevance with structured citations.

5. Mobile SEO & Website Optimization

To improve mobile rankings, an SEO agency will:

* Ensure your website is fast and mobile-friendly.
* Improve page load speed.
* Implement structured data markup for better search appearance.

**The Summary**

In a competitive market like Mississauga, businesses can’t afford to ignore local SEO. A professional [SEO company in Mississauga](https://www.thirdeyedesigners.com/mississauga-seo/) ensures your business appears at the top of search results, helping you:

* Increase visibility on Google Maps & Local Search.
* Attract high-intent customers searching for your services.
* Improve conversion rates & revenue.
* Stay ahead of competitors in the local market.

If you’re ready to grow your business with local SEO, partnering with a trusted Mississauga SEO company is the best step forward. The sooner you optimize, the sooner you start seeing results—so don’t wait!

I’m one week into a slightly modified 75 hard (modifications in picture). Here is my progress update:

**Workouts:**
I’ve gotten up and gone to Planet Fitness every single day. I do their 30 minute express circuit training, plus an additional 15 minutes on an exercise bike, as my first 45 minute exercise of the day. 

I only worked out outside on Monday. We got hit with a huge snowstorm and so my second 45 minute workouts have been inside on my treadmill in the basement each day, m-f.

When Saturday hit, I decided I would give myself a break from the 5 AM gym start time and let myself go in at 9 am. I also decided to stack my workouts Saturday and Sunday and do 90 minutes at planet fitness each day, stretching out my bike time and switching to the elliptical when my butt got sore >.< 

I had been struggling with motivation for the second 45 minute workout during the week and I knew it would be even worse on the weekend, so why not knock it all out when I’m already going? No excuses then.

I’ll go back to splitting them up Monday through Friday again. And I’ll get back outside once outside isn’t trying to attack me.

**Diet:**
Intermittent Fasting is HARD lol. I didn’t realize how incredibly food motivated all of my morning activities were. I’ve learned food is literally the first thing I think about when I get out of bed. Having to wait for food until 11 o’clock has been a real mental challenge for me. I’m getting carried through by black iced coffee and plain chai tea.

I’m already California sober so giving up alcohol is something I did years ago… but whole30 means no diet soda and oh boy that’s rough. Whole 30 compliant Beef stew, chicken salad, and Italian chicken sliders have been the biggest hits. 

Valentine’s Day we celebrated with Chipotle because they have a lifestyle bowl that is Whole 30 compliant; and so my present was not having to cook dinner :D

**Water:**
I HAVE TO PEE ALL THE TIME >.< it’s harder than I thought to hit the full 128 oz goal, and a few nights I was slamming a bottle of water right before bed to make sure I didn’t miss the goal. Haven’t slept through the night without having to get up and pee twice yet lol.

**Books:**
Finished Atomic Habits, UnFu*k Your Life, and started on The Let Them Theory. 

Highly recommend the audiobook of UnFu*k Your life, (especially if you suffer from negative self talk) it’s great! 

**Weigh in and pictures:**
I fucking hate taking the daily pictures because I hate my body, but I’m doing it. The weigh-in usually gives me a boost, but water weight does all kinds of stuff to make you fluctuate, so I tend to weigh in a few times in a day and note down the best number to build up my confidence >.<

**The Numbers:**
- Start weight: 194
- Week 1 (current) weight: 184 (10 lbs lost)
- Goal weight: 150 (34 lbs to go)

I may include arm/waist/thigh measurements (etc) and progress photos once I’m done, or once I’m happy with my body, for now just know I’m tracking measurements weekly. 

**Overall:**
I feel determined, and that I can do this. I also feel fat and ugly and nowhere near the goal line. 

10 lbs lost should feel amazing… but the daily photos remind me that I still look god awful, and so I have literally no joy about my progress. It’s a mixed bag emotionally. 

I’ve got events later this year that I want to look good for, and I keep them on a tracker on my phone and try use that countdown as motivation. In particular I want to do a cosplay at Twitchcon in October, and I need to drop a lot of belly fat if I’m going to pull it off. 

I’m going to keep going! I’ll check in with y’all next Monday! ",3,1739789729.0,75soft,0,1.0,False
1irha2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1irha2d/im_over_my_relationship/,I’m over my relationship,"This is just a vent because at this point I feel like there’s nothing else I can say or do to get my partner to understand the things that makes me upset and I’m tired of trying. 

We’ve been together just under a year. When we first met, we were both pretty fresh out of our previous relationships with the mentality of staying single and working on ourselves. However, we clicked instantly, and after knowing each other a week, 4 of those days being spent together entirely, we decided to make it official. 
In hindsight, this was a mistake. We never took the time to get to know each other to decide if we are truly a good match or if we were just excited to have someone with shared interests, similar humor, future goals, etc. We grazed over our past relationships and why they hadn’t worked out, mine being “I was too much” and his being “he’s not enough”. At first we worked well together and were able to reassure each other constantly and in the ways we needed. This changed very quickly. 

He had gone through my phone (one month into dating) and seen messages to guys I had previously slept with, some unopened messages, some current. I won’t lie and say I was perfect, but he accused me of cheating where I would say I was not. The messages he saw were from either before we were dating or, again, unopened ones that I left unread since we started dating. There was one that, admittedly, I would still talk to, but it was a fling and we were still friends. I know I’m loyal and that it wouldn’t have affected our relationship as we wouldn’t hang out or anything, just casually message about our days and vent about life. Should I have deleted these people and removed them from my space? Yea probably, but I truly didn’t think it was a big deal since I wasn’t currently talking with them and I’m not huge on social medias. Anyways, he called me many names like slut, whore, liar, cheater, etc. I took the blows because I could see how it would have looked on another persons end, but I attempted to leave because I still don’t deserve that disrespect without as much of a chance to explain myself. He stopped me by getting in the way, putting his hands on my biceps (not abusively). He gave me a hug and apologized for getting so upset and throwing a coffee into the wall. I decided to stay. He made my life hell about it for a month, constantly making remarks about not trusting me and forcing me to delete people off my phone, not letting me hang out with certain friends (females), needing constant reassurance. 

After a while I thought we were doing fine. We moved in together and things seemed like they were perfect. 
He falls asleep watching YouTube, and one night (about 2-3 months after the first incident) he left his phone in the bed and I woke up around 3 am and it was still going. I went to close out of YouTube and his photos was also pulled up in his Hidden file. There were endless nude pictures of his exes and screenshots and videos that are forever engrained in my memory. I looked through his messages, Snapchat, everything. Instead of freaking out on him (I wanted to rip his head off) I went to sleep, we woke up and went to work and went about our days as normal, and when we came home I had a conversation with him about it. Initially, when I brought it up he had lied about all of it saying they’re old and he doesn’t look at them anymore. This is probably crazy on my end, but I looked at the information tab for the pictures only to find out that he’s been re-saving them over the span of our entire relationship. Also, falling asleep with those images pulled up on your phone isn’t very reassuring if “you don’t look at them anymore and forgot they were there”. Pictures of another woman at her wedding where her cleavage is showing. Texts to an OnlyFans model on Snapchat saying she’s a goddess and that he loves her spicy pictures. Now, there’s almost no chance she’d ever look at the messages without a dollar attached, but it’s the principal that he had reached out to another woman for whatever reason to seek some sort of validation or attention from her. I told him that I knew he was lying and he was hell bent on it being the truth. Eventually I told him if he can’t be honest with me then there’s no way we’re going to work out. I found out he was still casually texting a girl he had also slept with “because they’re still friends and it was a one time mistake”. Again, based off principality and how he’d treated me over the same situation previously, I asked him to remove all people he had slept with or had any intimate relations with. He said it would be tough because “she’s such a nice person” but he will do that for me because he loves me. 

Fast forward some time and he hadn’t done any of the things I asked like deleting the people from social medias (saying he’s not very active, but he’s on them daily), stopping the pictures of other women, keeping his eyes on me, etc. So we talked about it again. 
I’d say these are the two bigger incidents but there were several other times it had happened. We talked about them all. I’d yell. He’d yell. We’d hug and then it’s all better again. I know I shouldn’t have kept going through his phone simply for the fact I was digging myself into a deeper hole of hatred, but at that point I had no trust for him and was dead set on making him stop his gross behavior since we live together and I wasn’t ready to pull the trigger on leaving him. 

A few weeks after this, we went on a trip with his friends for a renaissance fair. We were all drinking and at one point he was trying to catch a bee in an empty cup right in front of me and I told him to stop several times since I didn’t want to get stung. I feel like that was a very respectable and basic ask. He wouldn’t stop so I put my hand in front of him to stop him from upsetting the bee and I knocked his glass of mead and literally the smallest amount had fallen onto his lederhosen. He started getting really upset, really fast. Talking about how “next year girls aren’t allowed in the trip, he knew it would be an issue, the girls always cause problems”. One of his buddies brings up going to the strip club since he was over the fair. My boyfriend and I discussed that going to the strip club was no longer an option (he tried so hard to convince me to go before any of this stuff had happened) when I confronted him on the images and texts to other girls. my boyfriend jumps into the conversation, again still shit talking right next to me saying “next year the girls aren’t coming so we can do whatever we want” where I finally snapped and said “if that’s the case then you won’t have a girlfriend”. One of his other friends starting coming at me saying things like “Why do you care? You don’t have ass and it’s not like you can shake it so why can’t he go?” and that sent me fully over the edge. I looked away and started silently crying, since everyone there were a part of his friend group and I realized I had no one to look towards. The girlfriend of the guy that made the ass shaking comment grabs my arm and tells me that we’re going to go for a walk (an angel fr, love her forever). I break down instantly and just start spewing everything that’s been going on between our relationship. She was speechless, and I mean genuinely didn’t have anything to say. My boyfriend is a master manipulator and would be caught dead before admitting he’d ever done something wrong. To all his friends, he was the perfect guy. 

Anyways, in all our drunken stupors, I spilled to his friends everything that’s been going on as well. And I will be completely honest, I did not hold back. I called him out for every shitty thing I felt he had done, told them he manipulates every story in his favor, will never admit fault, and puts on this facade of a knight in shining armor when he’s the actually the bear. I did and still do feel bad for 1. bringing down the mood of the trip and 2. outing him to all his friends in the way that I did. All his friends think I was the one overreacting and that I had caused the whole commotion, which really sucked to find out just three days ago because his friends come over for D&D and I cook for them and clean and let them do their thing for however long they want and I go do my own thing by myself. 

He’s lied to me about so many little things. He’s in sales and was selling to one lady who he said his buddy was selling to. Claimed she called him “the best backseat driver” and that she was flirting with his friend. I saw messages between him and her and he lied about it. He was her sales guy, and she was saying those things about him. She was sending him hearts and saying he’s the best backseat rider, he said she will always have him as a backseat rider and that he’s “HER car guy 😎” (exact text from him) and I understand that sales is sales but how is that different than me working for my tips at the bar? I had to quit my job there or he was going to leave me. 

Fast forward, the same things keep happening. We’re fighting over everything. I explain, yell, scream, cry, shut down, leave, everything. He is not getting it. I feel so useless. I cook, clean, work, pay my own bills, work extra side jobs, you name it. I do it. I feel like I’m not good enough. Which is crazy to feel that way by someone who said they never felt like they were good enough. The other day I was in the middle of doing something and he kept asking for my attention to watch some stupid videos, and I repeatedly told him one second, I’m doing something and that I wasn’t wearing my glasses. After the second or third time he looks at me and goes “do you still love me?” and we had another huge talk/argument. 

I explained how I feel like I’m going crazy and that all my attention constantly has to be on him and that I have to cater to him and he can’t do something as simple as block someone, when I have done that for him. I told him how I’m tired of explaining myself ever. single. time. we get into something and that he always says he’ll be better but he never is. How he never listens to me or listens to my feelings and I’m expected to be at his beck and call. He told me how he feels like I don’t like him and that he’s scared of me and I asked him why he chooses to stay with me if he feels that way. He said he loves me and I simply don’t believe him anymore. 

Eventually, after several hours of back and forth we concluded the conversation on a decent note and hung out for a bit before going to bed. 

I’m at a point where I feel stuck and I’m going insane. There’s days where I appreciate his presence and I remember why I love him, but the negative heavily outweighs the positive. Many times I can barely stand to be in the same room as him, let alone share a bed. We resigned our lease and are here until the end of the summer in 2026. I hate that I did that. I regret it everyday. I can’t afford to break my lease and can barely afford anything more than what we’re already paying. We live in a pretty cheap area (college town) so it’ll be nearly impossible for me to find anything until I get some of my debts paid down. 

Oh well, repercussions to my own actions I guess. 
I know I’m not perfect and can be quite the handful, but this time around I’ve genuinely tried so hard to not be overrun by my emotions and freak out at every little thing. But I feel insane. I’m losing my mind. I don’t trust him. I don’t trust myself. I don’t trust anyone. I’ve never been one to be insecure but I look at myself in the mirror and can’t even recognize myself. I’ve changed everything in my life for this man. I quit my bartending job after he went through my phone and became AGM at my current workplace. I moved away from my friends and family and have sacrificed many holidays to be with him and his family, or doubled up on plans and exhausted myself to please his needs to show face to them. He guilts me into doing things “because it would be nice” and “they’d love to see me”. I just can’t do it anymore. 

I’m tired. 
No, not even tired. Exhausted. I am so exhausted. 
I have poured my heart and soul into this relationship to make it work. It’s not. It never will. We will never see eye to eye on anything. I will never trust him, and he will never change. 

I just want someone to fight for me the way I fight for everyone else. My heart has hurt so much I’m immune. I have no empathy. I can watch him cry and not feel a thing. It’s terrible, I feel terrible… but I really don’t anymore. I feel nothing. 

Every ex he had was crazy and that he was a poor victim to them. I now firmly believe that he pushed them to act in certain ways as he is with me. I might just be going crazy but I’m not one to freak out over nothing and am typically a very patient person. You have to really push me and once you break that barrier it’s all hell breaks loose. But you have to TRY to get me there. It’s not pretty but it isn’t a simple task. 

Anyways, thanks to anyone that took the time to read this shit show and sorry if it doesn’t make much sense. It’s almost 5 in the morning and I can’t sleep knowing that if I sleep, I’ll wake up to the same shit just a different day. Drop advice if you’d like but I know what I need to do.

Instead of loading it with generic fat-burning ingredients, focus on enhancing how your body processes energy.

1. **Green Coffee Extract** – Before roasting, coffee beans have a higher amount of chlorogenic acid, which slows carbohydrate absorption, helping your body tap into fat stores. Add a dash of green coffee powder to your brew.
2. **Cold Brew + Apple Cider Vinegar** – Sounds unusual, but a splash of ACV in cold brew can support digestion and regulate blood sugar spikes, which means fewer cravings.
3. **Maca Root Powder** – This isn't just a superfood; it helps balance hormones that influence metabolism. A teaspoon in your morning coffee can help with steady energy and fat breakdown.
4. **Sea Salt + Espresso** – Electrolytes matter for metabolism. A pinch of high-mineral salt in espresso can boost hydration and prevent sluggish metabolism—especially if you're intermittent fasting.
5. **Butter vs. Ghee** – While butter coffee is well-known, ghee has butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that supports gut health, making it a cleaner choice for digestion and fat metabolism.

The key is experimenting with ingredients that work with your body rather than just following trends. A coffee that supports **stable energy, digestion, and fat utilization** will always be better than one packed with random fat-burning additives.",0,1739789343.0,IndiaCoffee,11,0.2,False

He messaged a few hours ahead to say see you soon and that he was looking forward to it. Then an hour before we were supposed to meet the chat and his profile just disappeared. No “account paused” no “left the chat”, just gone.

I suspect it was someone either just deliberately wasting people’s time for lolz or some sad bitter man catfishing to teach women a lesson for not wanting them.

I will be working from the Presidio, and would like to live around there as well, if possible!

What’s it like commuting from further out, ie Mill Valley, Tiburon?

Because I’m only coming for a month, I’ll need a short term furnished rental and because I’m from the UK, I don’t have a credit record there so likely wouldn’t be able to rent down the “traditional” routes - Airbnb is the obvious place to look, but wondering if there are any other suggestions. Have looked on Ohana as well, but not sure how reputable it is? Any other places you’d suggest? 

I don’t want to pay more than about $4,000, would like a place on my own (studio or 1-bed) and keen for some basic neighbourhood things like coffee shops and local bars and grocery stores nearby but don’t need loads of bars or nightlife - I’d prioritise quiet, safety, and scenery above convenience, and would prefer the availability of hikes, outdoorsy stuff nearby rather than city centre perks.

1irh2gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOR/comments/1irh2gf/failed_first_cycle_what_to_ask_for_next_round/,Failed first cycle - what to ask for next round?,"Hi all -- grateful for this community, and looking to benefit from your experience with some advice.

As background, I'm 37f, no known endometriosis or PCOS. Very regular 26-28 day periods. Started trying 1.5 years ago and almost immediately got pregnant, but I had a MMC at 11 weeks, followed by severe hemorrhage during D&C. In the six cycles after that, I had two chemical pregnancies and another miscarriage at about 5.5 weeks, again with excessive bleeding.

For obvious reasons I didn't think of myself as having infertility, and the RE suspected ""hyperfertility"" -- e.g. I implant every egg/embryo, no matter the quality. We turned to IVF last fall in hopes of preventing or at least reducing the risk of further (dangerous, for me) miscarriages through PGT-A testing.

In early December, I was shocked that my AMH measured at .38 and my FSH at 9.8, but I had a relatively decent number of follicles (5-8). No MFI. The RE was optimistic about odds for success given multiple rounds of trial/error to bank embryos. We are also very fortunate that money is not a big constraint, and we are both OK with using donor eggs if absolutely necessary (though of course we would prefer to avoid it).

This first round, I had an AFC of 7, with 3 follicles responding. They were measuring 19mm 19mm and 17mm at trigger, with another lagging behind at 10mm. E2 the morning of trigger was 840. Protocol was two weeks of birth control priming then lupron flare microdose, started with 375 Follistim/150 menopur, rising to 450 Follistim/225 menopur at the end. Stimmed for 11 days and triggered with Pregnyl 10,000. I tolerated all the medicines really well, except the birth control priming, which put me into a temporary but pretty severe depressive episode.

They were expecting 3 mature eggs. Ultimately 4 were retrieved, but only one was mature. It fertilized normally with ICSI but didn't make it to blast.

We're heading into a second round for late-March. The RE has suggested a new protocol with 7 days estrace priming, follistim/menopur again, ganirelix antagonist, dual pregnyl/lupron trigger, adding LensHooke device,  and probably stimming a couple additional days until the follicles are a bit larger. This all seems facially reasonable to me as a next step, but I'd be grateful for your take -- is there anything else I should be considering/asking for? Does this seem like a good approach? Thank you!

Other lifestyle/background notes: I'm a non-smoker, no drugs, normal BMI, in good physical shape, one cup of coffee a day. Wine is my vice of choice but I've dramatically cut it back, and eliminated alcohol entirely during stims. Diet is pretty good and balanced, though I have a sweet tooth. I've been taking theralogix Ovavite (with CoQ10) since mid-December, and just added in fish oil and acai supplements. RE seems very blase about any additional supplements or lifestyle changes, and strict/restrictive diets are probably incompatible with maintaining my sanity.",4,1739788819.0,DOR,0,1.0,False

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone completely new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine and has half-way functioning train networks, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

The action in series mentioned below is a fairly good representation of how, more or less, do I like action in my stories:

Vinland Saga (on the more conservative end), Castlevania (the animated series), Fullmetal Alchemist, Inuyasha (on the more whacky end)

While I understand that to many of you it is probably too much, I'm unfortunately only willing to compromise so much when action is concerned. (Such as, I do like comically oversized swords every once in a while, but I don't need those in order to be happy!) So, let me repeat myself: before reaching out to me, please make sure that all that I've just said sounds up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

To elaborate a bit more on romance, as I feel it's important: my approach to romance is that I love to have it, and I love to write it, *but* that it should be, at the end of the day, just a sub-plot. Not that it cannot feature into the main plot at all. That'd Just be silly! What I mean is that if the romance element were to be excised from the story, we would still end up with a coherent, intact storyline. I also generally speaking prefer a more slow-burn sort of approach, where it takes quite some time before the characters enter any sort of relationship, *especially* when it's our lead characters. It's not a 'do or die' sort of preference, as all that ultimately depends on the story and the partner, BUT! It's very unlikely that I'll be open to our characters becoming romantically involved quickly! Please keep that in mind, before reaching out!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania (the animated series, not the games), Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.

If you look at the map you’ll notice that this very much could be a possibility and I see it really easing traffic in the area because it creates more entry/exit points into and out of Majan/Al Barari/Legends. 

Not only that but although Majan and Al Barari really lovely areas but I feel they’re lacking gyms, restaurants, supermarkets, coffee shops etc, and if they would open up a direct route between both areas and Meydan/Dubai Hills then it would mean better access to the other areas’ facilities.

I personally have a problem with the gym options here. There are only a handful of gyms here and none of them are worth it. I signed up for 6 months for the Al Barari gym and for the insane price you don’t get much. It wasn’t worth the membership fee at all for me. If they would make Meydan/Dubai Hills more accessible I would be able to sign up for Wellfit Meydan, FitnGlam Dubai hills or even the new FitnGlam that will be opening in NAS soon, which are both considerably cheaper in comparison to the Barari Gym and have much much bigger and better facilities and classes. 

Overall it would just be nice to be able to access neighbouring areas easily from Majan/Barari/Legends considering our only 2 entrance/exit points are from E311 and we would have to go through the highway to get literally anywhere.

# Tenant Insurance in Ontario: Why You Need It in 2025

As the rental market in Ontario continues to grow, **tenant insurance** has become an essential safeguard for both **renters and landlords**. Whether you're **a tenant protecting your belongings** or **a landlord securing your investment**, the right insurance coverage can provide **peace of mind and financial protection**.

In this guide, we’ll explore **why tenant insurance matters, what it covers, and how Duuo Insurance** is revolutionizing the rental insurance industry.

# 🏡 What is Tenant Insurance & Why Does It Matter?

**Tenant insurance** (also known as **renter’s insurance**) is a **policy that protects tenants** from unexpected financial losses due to theft, damage, liability claims, or other covered incidents.

# 🔹 Why Do You Need Tenant Insurance?

✔️ **Protects Your Belongings** – Your landlord’s insurance **does NOT** cover your personal items.

1irgxlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1irgxlk/stay_safe_online_why_you_need_a_vpn_for_secure/,Stay Safe Online: Why You Need a VPN for Secure Browsing,"The internet is a vast space filled with both opportunities and risks. Whether you're browsing from home, using public Wi-Fi, or accessing geo-restricted content, your online security and privacy are constantly at risk. This is where a VPN (Virtual Private Network) comes in. A VPN enhances your online experience by encrypting your internet traffic, hiding your IP address, and allowing you to browse safely and anonymously.

Let’s dive into why using a VPN is essential and how it can benefit you.

# 1. Protect Your Online Privacy

Every time you go online, your data is at risk of being tracked by advertisers, internet service providers (ISPs), and even hackers. A VPN masks your IP address and encrypts your data, making it nearly impossible for third parties to track your browsing history or personal information. This means greater privacy and freedom online.

# 2. Secure Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks in coffee shops, airports, and hotels are convenient but highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hackers often use these networks to intercept sensitive data like passwords and credit card details. A VPN adds a strong layer of encryption, ensuring that even if someone tries to intercept your data, they won’t be able to read it.

# 3. Bypass Geo-Restrictions and Censorship

Many websites and streaming services restrict access based on geographic location. A VPN allows you to connect to servers in different countries, making it appear as if you’re browsing from that location. This means you can enjoy your favorite content from anywhere in the world without limitations.

# 4. Avoid Bandwidth Throttling

ISPs sometimes slow down your internet speed based on your activities, such as streaming or gaming. This is known as bandwidth throttling. With a VPN, your internet traffic is encrypted, preventing your ISP from seeing what you're doing and ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted online experience.

# 5. Enhance Online Security

Cyber threats like phishing attacks, malware, and data breaches are more common than ever. A VPN provides an extra layer of security, protecting your device from cybercriminals who may try to steal your data. Whether you’re working remotely, shopping online, or accessing sensitive information, a VPN keeps your connection secure.

# 6. Anonymous Browsing for Ultimate Freedom

If you value anonymity online, a VPN is a must-have tool. It prevents websites and search engines from tracking your online behavior, ensuring that your personal data remains private. This is especially useful for journalists, activists, or anyone who wants to browse without fear of being monitored.

# 7. Affordable and Easy to Use

Setting up a VPN is incredibly simple. Most VPN services offer user-friendly apps for all devices, including smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Once connected, you can enjoy a safer and more private browsing experience with just a few clicks.

# Final Thoughts

A VPN is no longer a luxury but a necessity in today's digital world. Whether you're looking to protect your personal information, bypass geo-restrictions, or secure your connection on public Wi-Fi, a VPN provides an all-in-one solution for online privacy and security. If you haven't already considered using one, now is the perfect time to explore your options and choose the best **outline VPN** solution for your needs.",1,1739788237.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

Over the past couple of months, Starbucks found itself at the center of a global boycott campaign which alleges the coffee giant’s support for Israel. They intend to put these allegations to rest with the introduction of the ‘Caramel Hijab-uccino,’ and other beverages.

Customer reactions to the new cups have been mixed. Some celebrated the efforts for inclusion and the business’ product innovation. Others struggled, as they spent 35 minutes ‘unraveling’ their coffee.

One Muslim patron complained about a grande sized strand of hair showing in his medium roast.

Some non-Muslim Americans were outraged and accused Starbucks of pushing the “Islamiization” of America

“This is terrorist coffee!” said Hank Williams at a drive-thru window in Arkansas.

“While I’m here, can I get two creeps of Splenda in my Shariah creep?”

1irgtt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1irgtt8/closure/,closure?,"So i have an ex of almost 2 years from a 3+ year relationship, last time we communicated was over text and that was now a year ago. I’m seeing someone else of several months and my ex may also be seeing someone else (he told me they broke up but they still follow each other so idk). 

ANYWAYS, i have not moved on from that last relationship as i once thought that i did and it’s starting to affect my current relationship…. okay it’s not starting to, it’s BEEN affecting it. i try to move on and not think of my ex but i can’t help it. he even shows up in my dreams while my current bf is sleeping right next to me and then i feel like a terrible person. my ex was my first love, so being in a relationship with someone else brings those feelings back up. there are a lot of differences in the two relationships… some good because my ex didn’t treat me the best… a lot of the differences aren’t inherently bad but i wish he was more like my ex so i see the differences in personality as a flaw sadly. my new bf is great but i just wish he had more of my ex’s qualities. (by the way, i thought i was over him until i started seeing someone new and the missing him slowly started again)…. these feelings have only intensified over the past several months, and i’m starting to wish i was single again because being in a relationship is making these feelings so much harder to bear and i’m seeing my current boyfriend without the rose colored glasses which makes me believe i should break up with him. the guilt is immense. also i find myself when i’m in public hoping that my ex will be there to give an excuse to come up and say hi and possibly open the line of communication again. i think about that kind of interaction with him so much that it shows up in my dreams and might be an obsession now. i know that’s bad to fantasize about and even creepy but i can’t help the way i feel without denying myself my  authentic feelings. i don’t want to lie to myself. 

well now, i’m realizing that i have questions. like a LOT of questions. i wrote them all down in my notes app just to get them off my mind and it’s like 15 questions that i have always wondered. i’m starting to think i’ll never move on until i know the answers to these questions. like all those times he lied about where he was - knowing that i had his location, why did he lie? or the time i found a nail in his car, is it actually from who he said it was? there’s so many more and the lore is deep ngl so i can’t get into it. 
but if i get these answers with his full honesty, even if the truth is he was cheating on me the whole time, i will sleep better at night with the answers to these questions. i’m not doing it to break my own heart or so that i feel better finding out he actually was loyal, i would do it because it’s just BOTHERING ME. like i want to know… i don’t want to reach out to him for an apology (especially since he already apologized) and i don’t want to reach out to tell him off, i also don’t secretly hope that we can make things work again. i mean deep down yes but logically too many things have happened that make that outcome IMPOSSIBLE. but i would be lying if i said i didn’t wish we could be together again but maybe in another life. 

but i genuinely just want to reach out and hope that he will agree to maybe a phone call or even getting coffee just so we can talk about these things and i can feel a sense of peace within my heart about everything AND STOP OBSESSING. i won’t even attempt to do this until i’m single again because i don’t want to hurt my bf, which makes this harder cause i don’t even really want to leave my bf because that will hurt him too. also, he’s treated me better than any man ever has (but still i don’t think he’s the one due to a variety of reasons)…. but yeah so it just feels like i’m stuck. and the more stuck i get, the more these thoughts consume me and start to invade my subconscious mind. i’m afraid that this is what will ruin my relationship because i’ll slip up or start to resent him for not being like my ex. 

i guess i just wanted to get this off my chest. if anyone went through something similar or got closure (successful or unsuccessfully) please do let me know what you think i should do, because i’m truly lost. these feelings are affecting my mental health and quality of life, it truly feels out of my control and i can’t see a way out of these feelings without directly addressing them with the person who is causing them. also please don’t call me a terrible person or try and make me feel bad because i already feel like that. thanks to anyone who replies. 

TLDR: i still think of and dream of my ex of 2 years (3y relationship), i have many questions that remain unanswered and deeply bother me. i would like to break no contact with my ex just to talk about it all and gain clarity about everything that’s bothering me. i’m also in a relationship that i feel the need to end due to these feelings toward my ex. waiting it out hasn’t worked, it’s been way too long. basically 2 years. any advice appreciated.
