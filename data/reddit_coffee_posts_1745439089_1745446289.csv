1k6buae,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k6buae/flair_vs_cafelat_robot_500/,Flair vs Cafelat Robot [500$~],"I recently started looking onto manual espresso machines since I’m loving the sustainability and the idea of not needing to take too much care for the machine.

I am having real hard times deciding between the cafelat and the flair 58.

My current setup:

2 aeropresses (to make 2 cups simultaneously) Commandante C40 A water bar to heat my water (no temp control or anything). A cheap AliExpress milk frother

My partner and I drink about one cup of coffee every morning, usually medium or medium-light roasts.

My partner drinks mostly cappuccinos and for me it really differs between each day.

I am really enjoying my brews, but I want to be able to learn more and enjoy espresso -based drinks.

What do you think I should get?

I found a deal for flair + nanofoamer pro for about 490$ for the second hand combo.

What do you think I should get? How’s the work flow with each? What would you suggest? What do you think I should consider when deciding?",1,1745445956.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1k6bmok,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1k6bmok/how_i_cured_my_laziness_and_became_disciplined/,How I cured my laziness and became disciplined (real talk),"So, basically, for the past 3-4 years, since I (F23) started Uni, I became so lazy and undisciplined to the point it became painful. My laziness went to alcohol issues, skipping classes, procrastination, gaining weight and being a bad person overall, 'cuz I was way too lazy to check up on people and to be mindfull about my friends, family and *myself*. 

My laziness and lack of discipline made me fail years at Uni, my boyfriend left me and so many other people, 'cuz I was a literal ratchet who didn't do anything with their life. I was immature and irresponsible.

The first habit I wanted to build was going to the gym. 
So I did it this way: 

1. I picked a part of the day when I wanted to work out
2. I said to myself that I will show up to the gym 4x a week (Mon, Tue, Thurs, Fri) at 8:30AM
3. So I did it for the first 4 months. I didn't care if my friends asked me out the night before, if I was feeling sad or unmotivated, if anyone needed some favor - I HAD TO GO TO THE GYM!!!! 
I told myself that I HAD TO, there was no inner argument about it. 
It was like that, at 8:30 I had to be at the gym. If I oversleep - run to the gym asap. 
Obviously, before that, I built a good workout plan and split by days. 

After 4 months I already got the habit so I knew I was going to go anytime during the day. I have an amazing physique now and I'm still going to the gym regularly (I started the gym in June 2022.)

Another habit was fixing my sleep schedule. 

As a lazy rat, I would go to bed at around 3-4 AM and wake up feeling dizzy and lazy. 

1. I stopped drinking coffee after 3 PM.
2. I decided to start preparing for bed at around 22:30, so I could go to bed at 23:15 and fall asleep until 00 or 01 AM 
3. Wake up every day at the same time. It doesn't have to be 5 AM or 7 AM. For beginners even 9 AM is okay. 
4. It is hard for the first 3-5 days but you will get used to it.

Note - whenever u don't feel like doing something, just tell yourself that you are a little ratchet who can't properly take care of their life and let laziness eat you out. 
Think of not doing your tasks as something immature and irresponsible - because it is immature and irresponsible not being able to correct your own behaviour. It is harsh but u need to be harsh in order to discipline yourself.

Now, STUDYING, the hardest habit to build.
I built it the same way I built my gym habit. 
Pick the time during the day and place to study. 
Prepare material the night before and it would be the best if you decide to do it as a first thing on your daily schedule. 
Watch Andrew Huberman, if u want study tips. 
Find your way of studying and pick days to study and pick days to repeat. Just like you have training days and rest days at the gym. 

CLEANING your apartment

I was a rat. So I was waiting for my apartment to get super dirty so I could clean it and I would spend 5 hours cleaning it and then wait 20 days for it to get dirty. I was washing dishes every 3-4 days. Sometimes even 5. I was a literal rat. I procrastinated even this.

I built a habit of washing my dishes either right after using it or at night. Every day.
And whenever I felt lazy to do it, I would put on headphones, turn up some podcast and slowly wash dishes, clean kitchen.
Same goes for bathroom. I would clean every day bit by bit so it doesn't build up.
I reserved Saturdays for vacuuming. 
And I also do my laundry every day bit by bit. 
I wash clothes in the evening, hang it to dry and then fold it in the morning. 

I hope I helped yall. Feel free to ask me additional questions.

However there have been some really horrible fights between us and I am looking for advice. One fight I had with him a while ago was because he met up with a female coworker for coffee and deleted the messages. However, I understand why he did because I do get extremely upset and angry. I have history of often losing control because of my anger. That day I started hitting, throwing things etc when I found out he had coffee. Calling him a cheater and even spat on him, I know I was at fault there for my reaction. He did push me after being spat on and called me b**ch. 

I decided to move forward because a lot of you said I was at fault there. I tried to work on myself. However, I started noticing I started getting angry again over little things, sometimes in anger I would also hit and yell etc insulting. He would obviously argue back and insult back. He wouldn’t take it seriously because he’s strong but it happened a few times. Over arguments, I felt like I’m becoming my old self again, the angry version which I was trying to stop. 

After lots of these fights I feel like he had a broking point, he took on some debt because I wanted to buy a new home which he couldn’t afford but it was my dream home. So he took a bit out but didn’t tell me and was going to pay it back once I old house sold, however it didn’t sell. He eventually told me and we worked through that. He apologized and said he was ashamed and scared to tell me. 

However our arguments kept continuing I kept calling him a liar etc and just over small things reacting a bit badly. During his breaking point he wanted to call it quits because we were just fighting a lot, then I got super angry and started swearing at him, saying fuck you etc, you’re ugly anyways and then insulted his dad. But I was super angry, but the insult towards his dad hurt him a lot, he again pushed me on to the couch and said the b word again. In his defence he says I called him that first but I can’t remember. I need help, I don’t know what to do, I feel like he has disrespected me but a part of me feels like I am in the wrong. I don’t know how to talk to a therapist to deal with this situation. He still wants to make things work. But I feel like he has no respect for me if he calls me that, I don’t know if I should see a therapist or what to even do. ",1,1745445361.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I’m really in need of some thoughts from fellow hospo profs on where you feel is the best location in the country to work/live and potentially open something! 

****
Back story: we are both hospitality professionals (chef and specialty coffee/restaurant manager) in our 30s, who have worked and lived around Aus and the UK. Ideally we would be in the UK still, but life happened and we ended up in beautiful Auckland. 
It’s felt like a bit of an uphill slog since we got here, to the point where, after 16 years, I’ve dropped out from hospitality and my partner, who is a very talented and experienced chef (totally biased but also facts), seems to meet brick walls everywhere because he isn’t part of the clique that seems to exist here.

We love and miss the British lifestyle and eventually want to open something that reflects this, however, I sometimes feel Aucklanders are a bit stuck in their habits and I’m not sure if this is the city for us professionally. 
It kind of feels like we’ve gone and built our experience in the way we were told we should, but here, it’s at our detriment. 

Has anyone else felt this way? If so, did you relocate? Open to discussion. 

*Disclaimer* I hold no resentment for Aucklanders, it’s just a personal opinion about their dining habits ☺️",2,1745445274.0,newzealand,3,0.63,False

During Covid, I got into synths. I now have a bunch of them, and it has turned into a very enjoyable hobby for me. 

If you are the type of person who would be interested in messing around with synths, and would like to share info and learn from each other, I would like to hear from you. 

My thinking is a once a week meeting at each other’s home for a few hours. 

If you are interested, please let me know, and perhaps we can go for coffee and discuss details. 

I have a strong hatred of cigarette smoke, so, if that is you, it won’t work for me. 

I am nervous about putting this out there, as it takes me a some effort to feel comfortable with  people.

Exploring the Best Books to Improve Marriage: Key Titles and Their Transformative Lessons
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Marriage is a journey filled with moments of joy, growth, and sometimes challenges that require attention and care. Many couples seek guidance to nurture their relationships, and one of the most accessible and enriching resources are books written by experts in the field of relationships. Choosing the right books to improve marriage can provide practical advice, deepen understanding, and inspire positive changes that transform how you and your partner connect.

### Why Turning to Books Can Strengthen Your Marriage

When daily life gets busy, couples often find it difficult to communicate openly or resolve conflicts constructively. Books dedicated to marriage improvement offer a thoughtful space to pause, reflect, and learn skills that foster healthier interactions. These books often include actionable steps, real-life scenarios, and research-backed insights that can make complex relationship dynamics easier to understand and navigate.

Unlike fleeting advice, books provide in-depth perspectives that you and your spouse can explore together at your own pace. This shared learning experience encourages teamwork and empathy, two cornerstones of lasting marriages.

### Key Titles That Offer Transformative Lessons

To boost your marital bond, here are some highly recommended books you can explore. Each book addresses different aspects of marriage, from communication and emotional intimacy to handling conflict and building trust.

- **""The Five Love Languages"" by Gary Chapman** – This book reveals how people give and receive love differently. Understanding your partner’s primary love language can deepen your emotional connection and reduce misunderstandings.
- **""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr. Sue Johnson** – Focused on emotion-focused therapy, this book teaches couples how to develop stronger emotional bonds and respond to attachment needs, which helps in reducing conflict and increasing feelings of security.
- **""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by John Gottman** – Backed by decades of research, this book offers practical rules and exercises for improving communication, managing conflict, and cultivating friendship and respect.
- **""Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"" by John Gray** – A classic work that explores the natural differences in how men and women communicate, providing strategies to bridge these gaps and foster mutual understanding.
- **""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel** – This book explores the balance between intimacy and desire, offering fresh ideas on maintaining passion and excitement in long-term relationships.
 
### Transforming Lessons for Lasting Impact

Each of these books offers transformative lessons that can significantly alter the way you interact with your spouse. For example, grasping the concept of love languages helps you recognize that your partner may express love differently than you do. This awareness alone can prevent feelings of neglect and promote appreciation.

In addition, learning to listen and express emotions effectively, as outlined by authors like Dr. Sue Johnson and John Gottman, encourages deeper empathy and reduces negative conflict patterns that undermine relationships.

Several books on marriage improvement highlight the importance of ongoing effort. They emphasize that good communication, emotional comfort, and physical intimacy require attention over time rather than being one-time fixes.

### Implementing Lessons into Daily Life

Reading the right books is just the beginning. The real power lies in applying these lessons with intentionality. Start by discussing insights from the books with your partner. Decide together on small changes or new habits you can try.

For instance, if you discover your spouse’s love language, make a weekly commitment to express love in that way. Or, if the book stresses mindful listening during disagreements, practice pausing and genuinely hearing your partner before responding.

This conscious effort nurtures trust and shows respect for each other’s needs and perspectives. Over time, these small but meaningful shifts build a stronger, more fulfilling partnership.

### Finding the Right Book for Your Unique Relationship

Every marriage is unique, so the best books to improve marriage vary depending on your relationship’s specific needs. Whether your goal is to improve communication, rekindle passion, manage conflict, or deepen emotional understanding, there is a book that can meet you where you are.

Consider what areas you and your partner find most challenging or want to enhance. Reading reviews, asking for recommendations, or even starting with shorter books or guides can help you find resources that resonate with both of you.

Books on marriage improvement not only enriches your relationship knowledge but also empowers you and your partner to co-create a happier, healthier married life.

</div>How to Apply Insights from Relationship Books to Strengthen Your Marriage Daily
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Start with Understanding and Reflection

Books to improve marriage often emphasize the importance of self-awareness and understanding your partner’s emotions. When you finish a chapter or a section, pause to reflect on what you’ve learned. Ask yourself how the insights apply to your relationship. For example, if a book highlights the importance of active listening, try to recall recent conversations with your spouse and consider how you could have listened more attentively. This kind of reflection helps transform abstract knowledge into personal growth.

### Communicate Openly Using New Techniques

Many marriage books introduce practical communication techniques like using ""I"" statements or expressing appreciation regularly. Make a habit of applying these strategies during daily interactions. Instead of reacting immediately during disagreements, try to use calm and clear language to express your feelings without assigning blame. For instance, say, *""I feel hurt when this happens,""* rather than, *""You always do this.""* Small changes in your speech can greatly reduce tension and foster understanding.

### Schedule Daily Check-ins

Time to connect every day is a common recommendation you’ll find in many books to improve marriage. Even just 10 to 15 minutes set aside for meaningful conversation can build stronger bonds. Use this time to share thoughts, discuss any issues, or simply ask how your partner’s day went. Consistent communication creates a safe space where both partners feel heard and valued.

### Put Empathy into Practice

Understanding your spouse’s perspective is key for growing closer. Books to improve marriage often stress empathy as a foundation for emotional intimacy. When conflicts arise, try to step into your partner’s shoes and recognize their feelings. This doesn’t mean you have to agree, but acknowledging their emotions can reduce defensiveness and foster cooperation. You might say, *""I see this upset you, and I want to understand more.""*

#### Tips to Enhance Empathy Daily:

- Ask open-ended questions to learn about your partner's experiences and emotions.
- Practice patience during disagreements instead of rushing to respond.
- Reflect back what you hear to confirm understanding.

### Create Meaningful Rituals Inspired by Your Reading

Marriage books often suggest rituals that strengthen connection, such as shared hobbies, date nights, or gratitude journals. Decide on one or two rituals you can realistically maintain daily or weekly. It could be as simple as sharing morning coffee together or saying thank you for little things. Rituals create positive memories and remind you both that your marriage is a priority.

### Handle Conflicts with New Tools

Many books offer conflict resolution methods designed for couples. Apply these tools when disagreements arise instead of falling into old patterns. Techniques like taking a timeout to cool down, focusing on one issue at a time, or negotiating compromises will help prevent fights from escalating. Practicing these skills regularly makes conflict less stressful and more productive.

### Celebrate Progress and Keep Learning

Improving marriage is a continuous process. When you notice positive changes from applying book insights, celebrate those wins with your spouse. This positive reinforcement encourages ongoing growth and deepens your commitment. Continue exploring new ideas by reading different authors, discussing them together, and adapting advice to fit your unique relationship.

#### Ways to Encourage Growth Together:

- Create a shared journal to jot down lessons and reflections.
- Set small relationship goals based on your reading.
- Attend workshops or couples' sessions inspired by book techniques.

### Integrate Practical Exercises Daily

Books to improve marriage often include exercises like writing love letters, expressing five things you appreciate about your partner, or setting intentions for the day. Commit to completing these simple activities regularly. These exercises don’t take much time but can dramatically improve emotional connection and positivity between you and your spouse.

### Remember That Patience Is Key

Applying insights from relationship books takes time and effort. Do not expect immediate perfection or full transformation overnight. If you or your spouse struggle with new habits, be patient and supportive. A healthy marriage is built step by step, and consistent, small improvements lead to lasting change.

By making these practical adjustments inspired by books to improve marriage, you create a daily routine that nurtures love, respect, and understanding. Your relationship becomes a living example of growth, where both you and your partner feel heard, valued, and connected every day.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right books to improve marriage can be a powerful step toward nurturing a stronger, more loving relationship. The best titles not only offer valuable lessons but also provide practical tools that couples can use every day. When you explore these transformative books, you gain fresh perspectives on communication, trust, and emotional intimacy—cornerstones of a healthy marriage.

However, reading is just the beginning. Applying the insights you discover is what truly makes a difference. Whether it’s learning how to listen more deeply, managing conflicts with kindness, or finding new ways to express appreciation, these daily practices build a solid foundation over time. Small changes inspired by what you read can lead to lasting improvements in your connection with your partner.

Remember, every marriage faces challenges, but with the right guidance from expert relationship books and a commitment to apply what you learn, you create a pathway to growth together. By engaging actively with these resources, you empower yourself and your spouse to foster understanding and joy in your marriage every single day. If you’re ready to deepen your bond, start by selecting a book that speaks to your current needs and commit to putting its lessons into action. Your marriage deserves that kind of care and attention.

I’m a Chicago-based comedy actor and I’ve done a lot of shows where the cast is relied on to go around their neighborhoods putting up posters. The day the posters arrive, I am so excited. I gasp and ooh and ahh with the rest of the cast as I’m handed my stack of 10 warm posters. I think about the coffee shops and street posts I’m gonna smack em onto. I imagine some stranger walking and by thinking “that’s a cool poster! I should go in cold on that show,” and they come see our amazing show and say “wow I had no idea that was gonna be so amazing! I’m really glad I walked by that poster!” I even make plans with cast mates who live near me to make a whole day out of it.

And then I go home from rehearsal and set the posters on my desk and they never see the light of day again. I wake up the next day and look at them and make a mental note to carve some time out in the next day or so to put them up. A week goes by and they’re starting to feel dingy and I think I should text some of my cast mates but don’t cause I’ll feel guilty if they’ve already put theirs up.

Straight out of a thrift *ukay-ukay* store and probably late to a vegetarian brunch, the *Fixed Gear Hipster* is a delicate blend of irony, grease, and Red Horse Beer in can. As seen in this exhibit (straight from the ancient scriptures of *Your Scene Sucks*), this two-wheeled road warrior doesn't just ride a fixie bike--he *is* the bike. Let's break down this rolling caricature.

**Racing Cap**: Worn sideways or backwards at all times, even when not racing. Especially when not racing.

**Wayfarers**: 'Cuz direct tropical sunlight and unfiltered Facebook popularity are equally blinding.

**Ironic French Mustache**: Groomed with Tancho *pamada* or honey, harvested from bees that only pollinate Starbucks coffee shops. Salvador Dali lookalike.

**Messenger Bag w/ Lock**: For carrying the essentials: fanzines, a reusable coffee cup, and that one book he *swears* changed his life (but haven't read past page 2).

**Other Messenger Bag w/ RHB**: 'Cuz hydration is important, and so is projecting his love for strong beer.

**Chest Piece From Punk Days**: A permanent reminder of that one time he was in an indie band that played two DIY shows in a garage.

**Vintage Bike Clipart V-neck**: Nothing screams ""I love bikes"" like wearing one across his chest. Bonus: it's in eco-friendly ink.

**Novelty Keys**: One opens his bike U-lock, the other opens his sense of self-righteousness.

**Backup Bike Chain/Belt**: Practical? Sure. Fashionable? That's debatable. Ironic? Absolutely.

**Daisy Dukes**: 'Cuz nothing says ""I'm here to fix gentrification (in state U's such as Peyups)"" like thigh-baring denim cutoffs a.k.a. *kutod*.

**Chain Ring Tattoo**: Earned by losing a battle with his own crankset--now it's a badge of greasy honor.

**Generic Racing Shoes**: Good for pedaling, great for awkwardly standing around during DJ sets.

The *Fixed Gear Hipster* isn't just a subculture--he's a two-wheeled philosophy. Catch him riding brakeless into EDSA traffic, sipping cold beer while preaching the gospel of vinyl records, and always, *always*, looking like he just arrived from a race that no one else knew about. He rides for freedom. He rides for style. Mostly, he rides 'cuz he can't afford Angkas or Grab.

I took my old, dusty diary filled with memories, doodles, random thoughts, and late-night rants… and gave it a voice. Literally.

Okay, not in a ""Black Mirror"" creepy way—but with AI. Specifically, the **AI Text Extractor feature on** [**MagicShot.ai**](https://magicshot.ai/).

# 💡 What is MagicShot.ai?

It's this AI image generator app that recently rolled out a super underrated feature: **AI Text Extraction**. Basically, it scans text from any image and turns it into editable, searchable, and even **AI-expandable** content. And it *actually works*—like, surprisingly well.

# 🧠 The Idea

I was scrolling through Reddit and saw a post about digitizing old notes with AI. I looked at my half-torn, ink-smudged diary and thought… ""What if I could bring this to life?""

Instead of typing out every page, I took pictures of my diary entries and uploaded them to MagicShot.ai.

# 🤖 What Happened

1. **Flawless Extraction** Even with coffee stains, doodles, and slanted handwriting, the AI picked up nearly all the words. Like, it knew my chaotic 16-year-old brain better than I did.
2. **Emotional Flashback** Reading my old entries in clean, digital text was *weirdly* emotional. There were things I forgot I wrote—poems, love letters never sent, deep 2 AM thoughts. And it was all there, ready to be saved or shared.
3. **New Possibilities** I used the AI to clean up and rephrase some stuff. I even asked it to turn my scribbled story ideas into short stories. It was like co-writing with my past self + an intelligent future AI.

# 🔥 Why This Feature is a Game-Changer

* 📷 **Snap & Extract** – Works on notes, screenshots, signs, handwritten pages—whatever.
* 💾 **Preserve Memories** – Perfect for digitizing old journals, recipe books, or even your grandma’s handwritten notes.
* 🧠 **Use AI to Expand** – You can ask the AI to summarize, continue, rewrite, or even translate the text.
* 💬 **Content Creators' Goldmine** – Turn handwritten ideas into digital posts without typing a word.

# Final Thoughts:

I didn’t expect this little experiment to be this therapeutic and creative. If you're sitting on a bunch of old notes, to-do lists, or diary pages, try it out. MagicShot.ai’s AI Text Extractor isn’t just a tool—it’s like a time machine for your thoughts.

I am  36M and was diagnosed with prediabetes 2 years back with A1C of 5.8. I lift weights 4 times a week and play tennis so, the diagnosis was surprising. I thought if I remove eating out and cook at home, may be it will come down. However, a year later, my A1C went up to 6.0. Since the last 4 months, I reduced my carbs significantly and became more active with weight training and cardio. Despite that my A1C only reduced to 5.9. My body fat is also very low because of the active lifestyle( 5.11 height, 165 lbs weight). I am not sure what should I change further. Below is my daily diet for reference. Pls suggest any inputs. 🙏
1. Breakfast : Greek Yogurt with almonds, chia seeds, walnuts, flax seeds, and blueberries+ coffee with 2% milk(very small qty)
2. Lunch: Green salad with chicken, tuna, black beans+ chipotle ranch
3. Evening snack: Omelets(4 egg whites only) + avocado+ coffee with 2% milk (very small qty)
4. Dinner: 1 tortilla with Chicken curry/ Veg curry.
I believe this is the cleanest I can eat. I drink one or two beers in a month so alcohol is very minimal as well. May be there is something else that I am missing?

///

I’ve been an author for about a dozen years now: an eternity by the standards of modern indie publishing. Things change whipsaw-fast in this business, so that twelve years has felt like fifty.

First there was Amanda Hocking. Then there was Hugh Howey. I was a founder of the original *Self Publishing Podcast* and one of the authors of *Write. Publish. Repeat* — a book that inspired a churn-and-burn mentality I began to regret when it spiraled out of control, same as the inventor of infinite scroll eventually regretted his own monster. 

“What works now” changed so quickly that nobody could keep up. When I started, all you had to do to succeed was to make the first book in your series free using a few of the five free days Amazon gave you. Then they introduced countdowns, which made free days even hotter. If you managed to get a Daily Deal, you’d eat caviar for a year. After that, Bookbub was the secret. 

You had to play the algorithms and watch your also-boughts to make sure you weren’t screwing them up. Set your categories just so. Build reader magnets. Stack promotions. Some people taught authors to buy reviews, but then Amazon cracked down on that. Others taught ways to game the system with partial books or reprinting public domain, but Amazon cracked down on that, too. There were bundles to get your book into and new promo strategies to try. 99-cent box sets were the bomb for a while, but then those stopped working, too. 

But the one tactic that never changed — that always moved upward, demanding nothing other than to work it more and more — was volume and speed of release. The birth of Kindle Unlimited put an exclamation point on that, because KU readers were diners at an all-you-can-eat buffet, and it seemed they never got full. Slow your writing in an atmosphere like that and you’d be buried in the deluge of books written by authors who’d worked harder than you … so the rule became: *Never, ever slow down.*

Authors began trying to publish a book every week or three just to keep revenue coming, afraid to go on vacation or take a break. On the podcast, we heard tales of burnout. Of authors sacrificing their health because they’d been bound by golden handcuffs: thriving careers that were as fragile as Faberge eggs, ready to collapse from hundreds of thousands to zero if they took too long between books and allowed readers to forget them, get bored, and move on. So many people I spoke to complained about the series they now hated but had to keep writing forever … because otherwise, all they’d built would fall to dust. 

The company I was working with at the time stepped out of the race and into the sideways game of chasing Hollywood deals (EX: [the TV series based on my ](https://www.johnnybtruant.com/p/10-things-i-learned-as-a-writer-when)[*Fat Vampire*](https://www.johnnybtruant.com/p/10-things-i-learned-as-a-writer-when) [books](https://www.johnnybtruant.com/p/10-things-i-learned-as-a-writer-when)), so for a long time I stopped worrying about rapid release. I ignored the front lines entirely until my first conference in five years, which I attended in Las Vegas just last month. 

I went to Vegas with grim expectations. Because now, atop the *faster-faster-faster* of it all, there was AI. Authors were finding ways to write books that were 90% or more AI-generated content, and we seemed just years away from saying, “Jeeves, write me a mystery novel” and thy will would be done. The conference, I was half-convinced, would end up being more of the same. 

I thought: *Maybe this will be the end for me as an author.*

I’d written about 120 books, back when writing 120 books in ten years still sounded impressive — but speed was simply *how I worke*d, not *what I strove for*. Truth was, I loved *writing itself*. It was the process, not just the product, that lit me up. I wasn’t interested in having AI write my books. At 1.5 million words per year, I simply was no longer fast enough to compete. And hey: Forget *standing out*. Forget *having fans*. It seemed to me that the game was now about outrunning and outlasting everyone else. 

As a writer, I’ve always been an artist. I love telling the story, not reaching the point where the story’s been told as quickly as possible, then repeating forever. I love finding fans who appreciate the care I put into my work. I love it when readers get in touch and say they’d never heard of me, but then they found me and one of my books got them through a hard time. 

*No place for artists now, though,* I assumed. Maybe my glory days — the days of spending my life doing what I loved more than anything — were gone. 

That’s the mindset I took to Vegas. 

But man oh man, were my dire predictions wrong. 

# Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by.

On my first morning in Vegas, I spent a few hours walking and talking and having coffee with my friend Joanna Penn. If you’re an indie writer and you don’t know Joanna, you’re just not paying attention. Her podcast, *The Creative Penn*, existed before mine and survived long after mine was gone. It’s far better, far more organized, and far more forward-thinking. Plus, she’s British. Our Yankee voices were never going to be half as mellifluous as hers. 

Joanna’s like me. She writes and does whatever she wants across many fields, genres, and disciplines. Because: *Right*. That’s something I haven’t told you yet about the problematic nature of my writing: I’m terrible at the consistency that bookseller algorithms require in order to succeed. I’ve written sci-fi, horror, satire, comedy, romantic comedy, biological thrillers, political thrillers, straight thrillers, adventure, nonfiction, fiction-as-nonfiction, literature, dark comedy, allegory, martial arts, even some dabbling in romance. My second book was *Unicorn Western*, which couldn’t decide if it was fantasy, western, or humor. My favorite series is \*The Future of Sex,\*which began life as sci-fi erotica before being tuned down to hard-R science fiction … set (via a network of a thousand Easter eggs) in our Audie-Award-nominated world of *The Beam.*

Try to explain *that* to an algorithm. They simply freak out. The only proper classification for Johnny B. Truant books is a genre called “Johnny B. Truant.”

But that morning in Nevada, Joanna told me, “The market is splitting in two. For people like you and me, we’re entering the age of the artist. Now, your genre can be *you.”*

She said this to me while other writers at the conference were talking about maximizing throughput on AI authoring. While another prominent author was announcing his plan to publish a thousand books (!!!) next year. Let me be clear: I mean absolutely no disrespect to the faster-faster way of doing things, because for plenty of authors, it’s ideal, and fun, and profitable. It’s never been my way, though. I’ve tried it. I fail every single time. 

Joanna’s words seemed truer and truer the more people I spoke to. I had no clue on my own; I’d isolated for four years and hadn’t the foggiest idea how things worked nowadays. But she was right. *Clearly*, she was right. 

The business of authoring seems to have reached a fork in the road. There are those who want to make a lot of books very quickly to satisfy the all-you-can-eat “whale readers,” yes … but as *quick* becomes *quicker* and the whales grow hungrier, the pace of it all is forcing authors who are like me (artist types, like carpenters who make furniture by hand) out of the game. But here’s the thing I hadn’t considered: **It’s polarizing readers, too.**

There are readers who burn through riveting story after riveting story on KU, or those willing to gamble on authors they’ve never heard of if the algorithms place their books prominently enough.

But there are *also* readers who are author-loyal — who want something different than the algorithms tend to give them. In the past, those readers tended to find their favorite authors and cling to them … but these days, they’re clinging much harder. 

These aren’t whale readers. They’re picky, and they take their time getting to know an author … but once they do, they go back again and again. 

In other words, Joanna is doing so well right now NOT because she’s attracting *fans of thrillers* or *fans of podcasts* … but because she’s attracting *fans of Joanna Penn.*

Suddenly, my genre called “Johnny B. Truant” had potential all over again. 

# The underserved and silent majority

It’s worth repeating: If you’re a fast-paced author for whom half the joy of writing is solving the discoverability-and-maximization puzzle, then more power to you. If the idea of teaching AI to write books is exciting, no judgment here. 

But I have few worries for those folks, because that kind of writer is being abundantly served right now. Abundantly spoken-to. I saw panel after panel about creating faster, creating more, publishing more efficiently, and making more money. Which is awesome. But the more I saw of those topics, the more I wondered about a *verydifferent* kind of author. 

I pictured someone just starting out, who’s wanted to write all their life. 

I pictured a craft-heavy author with an emotional story they just want told. 

I pictured the struggling mid-list author, because the mid-list is going the way of the corresponding middle class. Like Mr. Miyagi said in *The Karate Kid*, you can’t walk in the middle of the road. If you do, then sooner or later: *Squish. Just like grape.*

Writing is an art. It can be a business too, but from the beginning, it’s always foremost been an art. Its core remains art, for a lot of people. And yet the messaging out there for authors is increasingly about *more and more* and *sell and sell.* It’s easy to feel lately that unless you’re prepared to gird yourself and fire a book uzi at the marketplace right from the beginning … 

… well, then, maybe you shouldn’t even bother trying. 

And that’s sad, because although authoring has become a 2023-optimized business, that’s not the ambition with which most people approach it. Forget the 7-figure superstars; the vast, *VAST* majority of writers are people who just want to write a book. Or a few books. They’re doing it because they have a story they *want to tell*, not a story they *want to have told* as fast as possible so they can tell another and another on repeat … QUICKLY, THOUGH, because the clock is ticking. 

I spent a lot of time thinking about all the would-be authors who are being left behind. All the new storytellers who are taking one look at the field and saying, “Never mind. There’s no point. Nobody will be able to find my book. Nobody will ever read my book. I’ve got stories in my heart … but the world’s a buffet now, and rising above the noise of everyone else is just *too damn hard.”*

**I want to be one of the voices advocating for** ***those*** **authors.**

I want to add to the neglected, unpopulated world of opinion that runs counter to the big, loud, faster-faster way of doing things. Faster-faster is one way, sure, but it simply isn’t for everyone. If we count “number of authors” instead of “number of books sold,” I’d wager the “go big or go home” approach is actually wrong for *most* writers. We’ve got a 1% situation going on here. Everyone knows about the authors out there making bank, but those authors represent an infinitesimal minority compared to the total number of authors — or would-be authors, or aspiring authors — in the world today. 

A few are making a lot of money by selling a lot of books. But most writers, I’m willing to bet, are never (and *will* never be) in that tip-of-the-pyramid elite. 

Ans so to the little guys, I offer this: *There’s hope in another way. There’s hope in the idea of a thousand true fans.*

# A Thousand True Fans

Based on everything I saw in Vegas — and everything I heard not just from Joanna, but from the other old-school publishing folks I count as my long-time friends — Kevin Kelly’s famous notion of “1000 true fans” is true all over again. The idea, if you don’t know it, is that artists of all stripes (writers, musicians, visual artists, and so on) don’t need worldwide fame to make a living. Instead, they only need a thousand true fans.

*True fans* *are people who will buy everything you make simply because you’re the one who made it.* I’m a true fan of Austin musician Bob Schneider, for instance. If Bob released a coloring book or an ornate fountain pen, I’d be there … because it’s Bob, and I love Bob. 

Get a thousand true fans, and you, as an author, are golden. 

That’s what Joanna was pointing me toward, on our coffee-and-walk date that sunny Monday morning. There are two paths through the yellow wood now, but most people only know about the one that’s well-traveled. But take heart, you millions of starving writers with just a handful of books to your name, because there’s also a less-traveled-by path … and if you decide to take *that* path, it might make all the difference. 

Joanna told me, “I’m releasing a nonfiction book about gothic cathedrals next year. When in the past could I ever release a book about gothic cathedrals?” 

*Never*, is the answer, if she wanted to be successful. Now that she’s taken the time to find her best readers, though? *Now*, she can absolutely do it. And why? Because she has true fans — not of any one of her books, but of *her as a person*. 

How you find your true fans is straightforward, even if it’s not easy. I’m not going to go into tactics here because this article is already long enough, but the short version is this: 

*Cast a wide net when publicizing your book. Nurture the vanishingly small percentage of people from that wide net who join your mailing list or otherwise get in touch to tell you that they love your work. Then be patient. Be very,* very *patient.*

If you’re lucky enough to already have some fans, wonderful. All you really need to do is to serve them well. Only: No, no, that’s not right. Don’t serve them. *Delight* them. *Spoil* them. If you only have a hundred true fans after tons of work, don’t get discouraged. You only need a thousand, remember? 

Ignore the advice about finding hundreds of thousands of casual buyers and focus instead on finding — and carefully nurturing — *devotees*. We (the artist types, or at least the not-go-go-go types) are playing a different game than that.

Collect true fans one-by-one for long enough, and you’ll eventually end up in an artist-writer’s paradise, free of pigeonholes and the usual reindeer games. Do *that*, and you’ll be able to embark on crazy ventures that the book-a-week crowd could never pull off. 

Maybe you release just one book a year, but maybe you offer it in leather-bound special editions that go for a mint on Kickstarter or in your private storefront. Maybe that single piece of IP each year ends up surrounded by a halo of lucrative bonus material that casual, non-true-fan readers would *never* buy, like side stories and audio releases and collector’s edition character cards. When you have true fans, your work is about quality, not quantity. When you have *those* kinds of readers — only about a thousand of them — you can write your own ticket and ignore the rat race completely. 

I’m just getting back into the game after a long time away, but just between us I’m beyond excited. 

We’re in an artist’s age now, and there’s nowhere I’d rather be.

Reddit, everyone swears this is AIgenerated, but hey, believe what you want.🤣🤣 

It’s Reddit, not a court deposition. I just need to vent about this absolute dumpster fire of a bride. Obviously, all names have been changed to protect the guilty and because I don’t feel like getting sued.

Okay, buckle up, Reddit. You guys will not believe what happened after the bridal boutique drama.

So, less than freaking 24 hours have passed since the whole ""THIS ISN'T MY DRESS"" incident at the fancy bridal shop. Maddie's feeling much better about her own gown, which, again, looked absolutely stunning, and we were just trying to put the whole chaotic scene with ""Alyssa"" out of our minds.

Fast forward to this afternoon. I was at the mall, grabbing a ridiculously overpriced iced coffee; my Starbucks will forever be the love of my life, even though it bankrupts me every time. when I spotted a familiar face browsing in a department store. It was ""Jess,"" the bridesmaid who made the swift ""I'm going to get the car"" exit during Alyssa's meltdown.Now, here's where it gets interesting. Jess wasn't alone. She was with a group of three other women I didn't recognize, and they were deep in conversation. 

Naturally, my ears perked up. Don't judge, you would too... 😆😆

I tried to be casual, pretending to look at some questionable scented candles nearby, and that's when I started to hear snippets of their conversation.

And let me tell you, it was not a glowing review of the bride to be.

I caught phrases like:
 
Honestly, I've been wanting to say something for months...
 
The constant demands are just exhausting always bitching about something!

I swear, planning this wedding is all about her and no one else and the poor guy she's marrying..
 
Remember that bachelorette trip she wanted? Yeah, fuck that I'm out shelling out money to that see you next tuesday..
 
And the kicker: I'm seriously considering just sending my regrets and telling her to fuck off!!!

At one point, Jess said something about the dress fitting and rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck. One of the other women replied with, Oh god, don't even get me started. I heard it was a dumpster fire of a shit show Jess just nodded grimly.I didn't want to be a total eavesdropper, so I made my escape before they noticed me lurking by the shoe section. But the vibe was strong.

These weren't just bridesmaids dealing with typical prewedding stress. This felt like some serious underlying resentment and definitely hate for Alyssa.

It makes you wonder if Alyssa's behavior at the boutique was just the tip of the iceberg. Maybe her friends have been putting up with this kind of thing for a while. Jess's quick exit now makes a whole lot more sense.

This whole situation just got a whole lot more complicated  and honestly, kind of sad.

Stay tuned for more unexpected reality show moments. Hoping to run into her soon before the wedding! 🤞

TL;DR Update: Saw the runaway bridesmaid, ""Jess,"" at the mall with a different group of friends. Overheard them talking major smack about the bride, ""Alyssa,"" hinting at deep seated issues and potential wedding day dropouts. The drama continues!

Here’s a version that frames it like an “Am I the Asshole” post:

Am I the asshole for blocking the roommate group chat and not helping around the house?

I live with two roommates—one guy and one girl. I’m very socially anxious and I deal with a bunch of health issues, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, and a degenerative disc in my lower back. I also pay more than either of them for rent. Because of everything I’m dealing with, I mostly stay in my room. I have everything I need in there—an air fryer, crock pot, ice maker, coffee maker, etc.—so I don’t really use the shared spaces much.

One of my roommates constantly sends messages in our group chat about small things that feel super nitpicky. Stuff like, “Do you have any spoons?” or “The bathroom is unusable, someone needs to clean it,” but when I check, the bathroom looks totally fine. I think she might have some kind of OCD tendencies or something, but it’s getting overwhelming.

Today, she messaged the landlord in the group chat saying someone has forgotten to flush five times, which was super embarrassing and felt unnecessary. After that, I told her I was going to block the chat because it was getting too much for my anxiety. She called me afterward and tried to guilt me about not helping clean the house—even though I never use any of the shared spaces.

So... am I the asshole?

Edit:

I will say that maybe once or twice it was me, but I'm not sure, I always do my best to double check if I flush. Also, I clean up after myself if I do go into the kitchen, and on multiple occasions, I have taken the trash out. I also have a mini vacuum that I have to clean up my own space. I don't live by myself currently because I'm trying to get full disability, and I've been working part-time for the past few years. I'm only here temporarily until I move in with my fiance, and I'm just trying to live one day at a time without having too much pain or stress.",0,1745443768.0,AmItheAsshole,19,0.4,False

EC3 def. Faarooq  
\- Farooq looks strong but loses to the NXT North American Champion. Post match shows Daniel Garcia watching on from a monitor. He snickers to himself ""That mans a VHS tape in a streaming era.""

**Week 2 - NXT**  
**Backstage Interview:** Daniel Garcia is asked about his comment on Faarooq last week. He says it's not just about Faarooq, it's about so called Legends in general. ""Everyone says respect the past. But when you cling to the past, you rot with it. And legends? They're just stepping stones with t-shirts.""  
He's interrupted by Bam Bam Bigelow, who challenges Garcia. Garcia says he has a match with EC3 next week, but Bam Bam's so old he can join the match and still win. Tripe threat action next week.

**Week 3 - NXT 2.0**  
**Daniel Garcia def. Bam Bam Bigelow and EC3**  
After the match, Garcia is interviewed again. ""I just beat a legend AND a champ. What's next? Another Museum piece?"" Linda McMahon interrupts and reminds EC3 that this was a triple threat match and EC3 effectively got taken out of the match due to a disruption created by Adam Cole and Roderick Strong. She says next week instead of beating former legends, he should beat some future ones and says she has another triple threat in store.

**Backstage segment:** Later in the evening, Faarooq goes to Linda's match and pleads to make the match a Fatal 4-Way so he can get his hands on Daniel Garcia. She says he'll get his chance but next week isn't the time. Faarooq leaves without saying a word, quiet with rage.

**Week 4 - NXT**  
**Bron Breakker def. Bronson Reed and Daniel Garcia**  
**-** Faarooq takes out Daniel Garcia before the match has even began. Hitting a spinebuster on the concrete floor, whipping him into production boxes and then after heading into the parking lot, hitting a Dominator on a parked car. Garcia is tended to by officials as Faarooq walks away.

**Week 4 - NXT 2.0**  
**Backstage segment:** Linda McMahon is furious that Faarooq disobeyed her. She says enough is enough and if he wants a fight, he's got it. She adds that although Daniel Garcia has picked up minor damage from the attack, his mouth made this mess and his wrestling skills can get him out. ""You disrespected a Hall of Famer. He answered. You want to finish it fine? Here's my answer: One Night Stand - you two can have a fight but it's unsanctioned. No referee. No rules. No pins. No pinfalls. Just a brawl.""

**NXT One Night Stand - Backstage Brawl**  
**Faarooq def. Daniel Garcia**

* Brawl breaks out between catering crates, production cables and flight cases.
* Garcia tries to outwrestle Faarooq with chokeholds and mat-style grapples, using a pole to crank leverage.
* Faarooq fights out with brute force - gut punches, backdrops on the hard floor.
* Garcia tries to slam a locker door on Faarooq's arm - misses, Farooq send him flying into a row of crates.
* The fight spills into a green room
* Garcia throws coffee in Faarooq's face, hits a low dropkick, and tries to escape deeper into the hallways.
* Faarooq tackles him through a board of soundproof panels, then grabs a steel sign and smashes it over Garcia's back.
* Garcia uses a steel chair to crack Faarooq's ribs and briefly gains control.
* Garcia grabs a mic cord and chokes Faarooq yelling: ""You should've stayed retired!""
* Faarooq powers out, slams Garcia into a TV monitor, and yells: ""I built this place. I'm not done yet!""
* Faarooq sets up two production boxes side by side.
* While he and Garcia stand on one, he delivers a Dominator to Garcia, smashing through the other production box.
* Garcia isn't moving. He's knocked out cold.
* Faarooq walks away, unwrapping his fists.
* Commentary: ""Garcia ran his mouth...and Farooq just made him eat every word""

1k6astq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1k6astq/the_babysitter/,The Babysitter,"I swear, it started out like any other quiet afternoon. Elie was on the kitchen floor, drawing her stick-figure masterpieces like she always does. I was in the laundry room sorting socks or something equally thrilling.

Then I heard her talking. Not in the usual sing-song way kids do when they’re playing with their toy, but like she was responding to someone.

I stepped into the hallway. “Elie?”

No answer. Just her little voice, saying, “Hi! I’m not supposed to open the door.”

My stomach sank.

I rushed into the kitchen, and there he was—right outside the glass back door. Crouched. Smiling. Holding a piece of candy up to the glass like he was offering a treat to a stray animal. His eyes are wide, like he hadn’t blinked in hours. Hair slicked back, but messy at the edges. His grin vanished when he saw me.

I screamed. Loud. He bolted into the woods behind our house so fast he was practically a blur. I didn’t even chase him. I just locked every door and called the police. They came, took some notes, said they’d send someone by to patrol. But we live on the edge of town. Surrounded by trees. It’s easy to disappear out here.

That night, I made Elie sleep in my room. I barely slept at all, listening to every creak, every gust of wind. I checked the locks four times.

By morning, I was wiped. Coffee wasn’t cutting it. Elie was back to being her usual self, playing with her doll in her room. I figured… maybe that freak just wandered off, you know? Maybe he was high. Maybe it was a one-off thing.

Then there was a knock at the door.

I looked through the peephole—it was just the mailman. Harmless. He handed me the usual mail and went on his way. But there was a box on the floor.

I picked it up, nothing written on it. I shouted at the mailman asking where this was from. He told me it was already there when he arrived.

 I opened it. Inside was Elie’s old toys. They were buried in a box somewhere in the attic. I ran to Elie’s room.

She was fine. Just playing. Calm. She saw the box I was holding. “You found them!” she shouted.

I said, “Elie, how did you get these?”

“That man gave it to me.”

I swear I felt the room tilt.

“What man?”

“He came in last night. When I was sleeping. He tucked me in and said not to wake you. He said we’d go soon.”

I couldn’t breathe.

“You stay away from that man, you hear me?!” I shouted.

“But he can’t be a bad man, mommy. His fingers taste like blueberries.”

------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding the Afternoon Energy Slump

Many people experience a noticeable drop in energy during the mid-afternoon hours. This slump can lead to decreased productivity, difficulty concentrating, and even irritability. Often, this dip in alertness comes after lunch and is influenced by natural body rhythms and blood sugar fluctuations. While caffeine is a common quick fix, it doesn't offer sustainable energy and may cause a crash later. This is where adaptogenic mushrooms present a natural alternative to support your body’s energy levels and resilience.

### What Are Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

Adaptogenic mushrooms are a group of fungi prized for their ability to help the body manage stress and maintain balance, also known as homeostasis. Unlike stimulants, adaptogens work by supporting your body's natural functions. They enhance energy, focus, and endurance without the jittery side effects that caffeine and energy drinks often bring. Examples of widely used adaptogenic mushrooms include reishi, cordyceps, lion’s mane, and chaga.

### How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Support Energy Levels

These mushrooms contain bioactive compounds like polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and triterpenoids, which contribute to their ability to positively influence energy and vitality. Here’s how they can help you beat that afternoon slump:

- **Boost Cellular Energy Production:** Cordyceps, in particular, helps increase the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule responsible for storing and transferring energy in your cells. This can improve how efficiently your body generates energy, enhancing overall stamina.
- **Enhance Mental Focus and Clarity:** Lion’s mane mushroom stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports brain health. This can lead to improved focus and cognitive function, helping you stay sharp when your energy dips.
- **Reduce Stress and Cortisol Levels:** Reishi mushrooms are known for their calming effects. By modulating your body’s response to stress and lowering cortisol, they prevent the energy drain associated with chronic stress, keeping you more balanced throughout the day.
- **Support Immune System Function:** Adaptogenic mushrooms strengthen your immune defenses, reducing the risk of fatigue caused by illness or inflammation. A healthy immune system keeps energy levels more steady.
 
### Why Choose Mushrooms Over Traditional Caffeine?

People often rely on coffee or energy drinks for an afternoon pick-me-up. While these can offer a quick boost, they are typically followed by an energy crash and may disrupt your natural sleep cycle. Over time, reliance on caffeine can lead to tolerance and increased fatigue. Adaptogenic mushrooms provide a gentler, sustained energy lift without these drawbacks. They enhance your body’s natural ability to produce energy and adapt to stress, leading to longer-lasting and more balanced alertness.

### Ways to Include Adaptogenic Mushrooms in Your Routine

Integrating adaptogenic mushrooms into your daily life can be easy and enjoyable. Here are some practical ways to start:

- **Mushroom Teas and Tinctures:** Brew dried mushroom powders or use concentrated extracts for a calming, energizing drink mid-afternoon.
- **Powdered Supplements:** Add mushroom powders to smoothies, coffee, or oatmeal to combine benefits with your favorite foods.
- **Capsules and Tablets:** Convenient supplements that provide consistent dosing without any taste.
- **Functional Mushroom Blends:** Some products combine different adaptogenic mushrooms tailored for energy and focus, offering a synergistic effect.
 
### Potential Benefits Backed by Science

Research on adaptogenic mushrooms demonstrates promising effects on energy and cognition:

- A study on cordyceps showed increased exercise performance by improving oxygen utilization, which translates to better energy management.
- Lion’s mane has been linked to enhanced memory and mental clarity through its neuroprotective properties.
- Reishi has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and stress-reducing properties, which contribute to less fatigue and better energy regulation.
 
### Things to Keep in Mind When Using Adaptogenic Mushrooms

While adaptogenic mushrooms are generally safe, consider these tips for best results:

- Start with a small dose to assess how your body responds.
- Choose high-quality, organic products from reputable sources.
- Consult your healthcare provider if you have allergies, are pregnant, or are on medication.
 
By incorporating adaptogenic mushrooms into your daily routine, you can experience a natural and sustainable solution for afternoon fatigue. These powerful fungi help your body stay balanced, energized, and focused—offering a smart alternative to the traditional energy slump remedies.

</div>Incorporating Adaptogenic Mushrooms into Your Daily Routine for Sustained Energy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Feeling a dip in energy during the afternoon is a common experience for many. This slump often leads to decreased focus, productivity, and overall mood. Thankfully, adaptogenic mushrooms offer a natural approach to smoothing out these fluctuations and supporting sustained energy throughout the day. These fungi have been treasured in traditional medicine for centuries, and modern science is starting to confirm their powerful benefits.

### What Are Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

Adaptogens are natural substances that help the body adapt to stress and maintain balance. When we talk about **adaptogenic mushrooms**, we refer to specific types known for their ability to support the body's resilience against physical and mental stress. Common adaptogenic mushrooms include:

- **Reishi:** Known for calming properties and immune support
- **Cordyceps:** Traditionally used to boost energy and stamina
- **Chaga:** Rich in antioxidants that help reduce fatigue
- **Lion’s Mane:** Supports cognitive function and focus
- **Maitake and Shiitake:** Immune enhancers with mild energy benefits
 
By incorporating these fungi into your routine, you can help your body manage stress better and maintain more balanced energy levels, especially during challenging parts of the day.

### How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Support Sustained Energy

Unlike caffeine or sugar, adaptogenic mushrooms do not cause a sharp spike and crash in energy. Instead, they work by:

- **Regulating Stress Hormones:** These mushrooms help lower cortisol, the stress hormone that can drain energy when elevated.
- **Supporting Immune Function:** A stronger immune system means less fatigue and better overall vitality.
- **Enhancing Oxygen Utilization:** Especially true with Cordyceps, which can improve how your body uses oxygen, boosting stamina and endurance.
- **Improving Cognitive Clarity:** Lion’s Mane, for instance, supports brain health, helping you stay alert and focused without the jitters caffeine might bring.
 
These benefits combine to create a steady and reliable source of energy that lasts throughout your day, helping you get through afternoon slumps with ease.

### Simple Ways to Add Adaptogenic Mushrooms Into Your Day

Adding adaptogenic mushrooms to your daily routine doesn't have to be complicated. Here are several easy approaches you can try:

- **Mushroom Coffee or Tea:** Replace your usual morning coffee with adaptogenic mushroom blends. They often come as powders that mix well with hot water, providing a gentle energy lift.
- **Supplements:** Capsules and tinctures offer a convenient way to consume standardized doses.
- **Cooking:** Use dried mushroom powders in smoothies, soups, or baked goods for a subtle, earthy boost.
- **Energy Shots:** Some brands create quick mushroom shots designed for immediate energy support.
 
By choosing a method that fits your lifestyle, you’ll be more likely to maintain consistency and enjoy the benefits fully.

### Timing and Dosage for Best Results

To maximize their effectiveness, adaptogenic mushrooms should be consumed regularly over time rather than as a one-time energy fix. Consistent use allows their benefits to build up gradually. Morning or early afternoon is often the best time to take them to avoid any potential interference with sleep.

Typical dosages vary depending on the mushroom type and product form. Always follow manufacturer guidelines or consult with a healthcare provider, especially if you have any health conditions or are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Key Tips When Choosing Adaptogenic Mushroom Products

Not all mushroom products are created equal, so keep these points in mind:

- **Look for Quality:** Select products made from organic mushrooms and verified for purity.
- **Extract Type Matters:** Dual-extracted mushrooms utilize hot water and alcohol methods to ensure both water-soluble and fat-soluble nutrients are available.
- **Check Labels:** Avoid additives or fillers that offer no health benefits.
 
Taking time to choose a high-quality product will make a big difference in your results.

### Why Adaptogenic Mushrooms Are a Smart Choice for Long-Term Energy

While an afternoon energy slump is often addressed with quick fixes like sugary snacks or extra caffeine, these can lead to more crashes later on. Adaptogenic mushrooms encourage a holistic and sustainable approach, supporting both your body and mind. They gently guide your energy toward balance instead of forcing it, which means you stay more consistent rather than burning out quickly.

These natural allies into your daily habits can transform how you experience energy throughout your day. Over time, you may find yourself feeling more vibrant, focused, and ready to tackle afternoon tasks without the need for multiple coffee breaks.

By embracing adaptogenic mushrooms, you’re choosing a gentle, natural boost that works with your body—not against it.

</div>### Conclusion

Afternoon energy slumps can disrupt your productivity and mood, but adaptogenic mushrooms offer a natural, effective way to fight back. These powerful fungi work by helping your body manage stress and maintain balance, which is key to sustaining steady energy levels throughout the day. By supporting your adrenal health and enhancing mental clarity, adaptogenic mushrooms reduce the typical mid-afternoon crash that so many people experience.

These mushrooms into your daily routine is simple and beneficial. Whether you add them as a powder to your morning smoothie, enjoy them in a warm tea, or take them as supplements, they can seamlessly fit into your lifestyle. Over time, regular use helps build your resilience against stress and fatigue, making those sluggish moments a thing of the past.

Choosing adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi, lion’s mane, or cordyceps can give your body the natural boost it needs without the jitters or crashes linked to caffeine or sugar. By prioritizing these natural remedies, you empower yourself to maintain energy levels that keep you motivated and focused from morning until evening. Embracing adaptogenic mushrooms could be the key step to unlocking a more balanced, energized day, helping you feel your best when you need it most.",1,1745443255.0,Adaptogen101,0,1.0,False

After the match, Garcia is interviewed again. ""I just beat a legend AND a champ. What's next? Another Museum piece?""

She says next week instead of beating former legends, he should beat some future ones and says she has another triple threat in store.

**Backstage segment:** Later in the evening, Faarooq goes to Linda's match and pleads to make the match a Fatal 4-Way so he can get his hands on Daniel Garcia. She says he'll get his chance but next week isn't the time. Faarooq leaves without saying a word, quiet with rage.

She adds that although Daniel Garcia has picked up minor damage from the attack, his mouth made this mess and his wrestling skills can get him out. ""You disrespected a Hall of Famer. He answered. You want to finish it fine? Here's my answer: One Night Stand - you two can have a fight but it's unsanctioned. No referee. No rules. No pins. No pinfalls. Just a brawl.""

The doctrine, the rules, the guilt, the checklist—it’s not from God. And once I saw it clearly, I couldn’t unsee it. None of the points count. All those 38 years of shame and anxiety and trying to be perfect? For what?

What really messes with me is how I’m now seen as the one who’s “fallen away” or “lost the Spirit,” while some of the most hypocritical people I know are still attending every week, posting their temple selfies, and leading organizations.

I have a close friend who’s in a presidency and goes to the temple weekly (and brag posts it every Friday)—but she tells me (maybe because I’m “safe” now that I’ve left) she drinks coffee on occasion, does her grocery shopping every Sunday, doesn’t wear garments unless it’s for show, gets tattoos, watches R-rated stuff, listens to explicit music, reads smutty books, wears revealing clothes on vacation… and yet she still gets held up as some kind of righteous example. I guess because she’s still showing up and playing the game. 

I’m not judging those things individually—do what you want. But don’t preach obedience and purity while living something totally different.

Meanwhile, when I was active, I was all in. I followed every rule to the letter. I felt soul-crushing guilt over even tiny mistakes. And now that I’ve walked away—because I saw through it—I’m suddenly the one who’s broken? The “lazy learner”? The one who just wanted to sin?

No. I left because I woke up. And what makes me so angry is that I actually tried. I gave it everything I had. The people who are just coasting along, picking and choosing what to follow while still holding up the “faithful member” mask—they don’t get questioned. But those of us who saw behind the curtain? We’re the ones judged and pitied.

It’s infuriating. And it’s so fake.

Something pretty embarrassing happened today that’s left me feeling overwhelmed and self-conscious. While I was meeting with a client, my laptop unexpectedly played some audio from a story I’ve been writing (nothing inappropriate, but definitely suggestive. And it didn’t play for long). I panicked, shut it down quickly, but I spilled my coffee in the process. Was definitely very flustered and it was at the end of the session and it didn’t get addressed. Worried that my behavior makes me look super “guilty” of doing something bad. 

I reached out to my old supervisor and she basically just said “oh no, I’m sorry,” and I’m not sure what I expected but I think I just needed some support.  Any advice on how to regain some self-compassion here would be greatly appreciated. 

I’m really struggling being able to sit at myself. I want to believe this is a small human moment, but I can’t right now. I already learned the lesson (close out all apps before starting a session/be mindful of what’s on the screen etc). I’d love any support, and sage words.

The DMV in our town, like all towns in the rural Midwest, is a sticky, humid pocket of the worst humanity has to offer.

If you think I'm overselling it, it's only a matter of time until you realize it on your own time. The price of freedom is and always will be a morning locked in that terrible, squalid little building just on the outskirts of my dying rural Michigan town. You'll know what I mean when you go there, too. It's a special hell, breathing through the smell of burnt coffee and sour sweat until your ticket is called and your nightmare ends.

I thought, that random Saturday in May, that the warm, freshly printed license in my palm would mean that I had earned myself another four years. Forty-eight blissful months without thinking about the receptionist and the stench of rot that clung to her like a rancid film to her pastel cardigan.

I should've known better than to think I would get off that easy.

If I were the lucky sort, I wouldn't have had to go in in the first place. After all, you can do half this shit online, now. The magic of technology, even in a place as slow and backward as this.

But the damn bureaucrats in Lansing told them you have to get a new photo when yours gets old enough, and ding ding ding, I'm old enough now. I get it. It's not like I look the same I did when I was sixteen, but I've got a camera on my phone for a reason, don't I?

So I took that Saturday off. I dragged my old, tired beater of a car up to the single-story building in the early morning hours, before even the birds were awake, and parked beside the rest of the dredges who were forced to be here instead of somewhere else worth being.

A full house, even this early. Rows and rows of old and young, curled in on themselves, dry, tired eyes staring vacantly at phones and paperwork. No one spoke, not even the kids. It was too awful to bother in a place like this. 

The only seat left was one in the back, which I took gratefully. Not even that was guaranteed, here. 

I had an appointment, but that didn't mean shit here when there were two people working and dozens on the schedule. So I waited, the tedious feeling of time slipping through my pale fingers, the light filtering -- pale and unsettling -- through the smudged, dusty windows.

\[NOW SERVING NUMBER 117\]

Me. Finally. I happily relinquished my spot near the bathroom and slid into the seat across from the only man on staff today.

He was older. Serious. His bulbous, dark eyes were nestled behind greasy, drooping eyelids and pockmarked cheeks. He'd seen better days, but he seemed nice enough, all things considered. I could see a picture of his family teetering on the edge of his desk, their faces grim and ashen.

""Do you have the paperwork filled out?"" He asked, voice low and dispassionate. I handed it over along with my old license, and he set to work. 

""We'll need a new picture,"" he said.

I swallowed back a wave of nausea, the stale, sticky air making me want to peel back my own skin just to shake it loose. ""That's fine.""

He lined me up in front of the old camera, took a serviceable photo, and nodded.

""When can I expect it in the mail?""

The man looked at me a bit strangely, but waved me away. ""Please go sit back down. We can print re-issued licenses in good standing here in the office, now. New policy.""

I wasn't exactly excited to wait, but it was better than risking it get lost in the mail. I'd walk out of here without a DMV in my future until after I turned thirty, and that was enough to make me smile a little.

It took 20 minutes for it to be delivered by the receptionist with the unlaundered cardigan. There was something pale and solid in the corner of her lips. I couldn't take my eyes off of it as she handed me my card. 

""Have a good day,"" she said, croaking and dismissive.

I took it without looking and hustled out to my car, taking great, heaving lungfuls of the clean late morning air.

I didn't look at my license until I got home. Maybe that was the first mistake. Or maybe my first mistake was taking it at all, instead of insisting they mail it to me and forgo that terrible new printer they kept sequestered in the back.

I'd already tossed my keys on the side table by the time I remembered my license, tucked in my pocket, and the empty space in my wallet where I belonged.

The thing was, I shouldn't have looked. But I was curious. After all, they didn't give you heads or tails about what the photo looked like, only took it and printed it across this thing that would live on your person for a decade, until you looked old, and worse, and had to visit their abysmal cesspool of stink and boredom all over again.

So I looked.

It was a fine photo of me. I looked like any other twenty-eight year old who never left their dead-end home town. Tired. A little rough around the edges. My skin was blessedly clear, and my hair only looked half as limp and greasy as it actually was, since I'd forgotten to shower after work yesterday.

Then, I saw it.

The first time, I figured it was a trick of the light. Maybe a side-effect of my early morning wake-up call, and several hours doing nothing but stare at my cracked phone screen as I played whatever idle game I'd gotten hooked on this week.

Because there was no way it was real.

Photos didn't blink. Their eyes, *my* eyes, didn't dart, lightning-quick and suspicious, in a sweeping arc around my desolate living room.

They didn't catch you looking.

There was an empty, terrifying vacancy when you held eyes with a photograph. With your own photograph. As though someone had washed the inside of you clean and put you back together, leaving you off-balance and hollow, with nothing left to ground you.

I shook the license, drawing a sharp breath and checking again.

The photo looked. Slower, this time. Appraising, as it took in my scant belongings and the cracks that littered the drywall of my shitty, low-income apartment.

I dropped it with a yelp and took a step back, breathing slow and even.

It was a trick. Surely it was. I was tired, or seeing things. 

I let myself have the luxury of a few more seconds of panic, steadying myself against the arm of my couch before reaching out a shaky hand to pick it back up.

The photo was as still as it should have been. Just me, a little tired, a snapshot of a morning that could have been better spent anywhere else. 

I tucked it away in my wallet, throwing it into the couch and beelining for my room.

I needed to sleep. If anything, this just proved it.

It is yet, another newbie asking for help. I recently bought a cooler master tower for 700 euros, with the following specs : 

- motherboard : B360HD3

- processor : intelligent core I5 ""coffee lake"" 

- memory : slot 1 : ddr4 16gb ; 2 : ddr4 8gb ; 3 : ddr4 8gb

- 1 to hdd + 275 ssd with windows, and i added a 2 to ssd evoplus for gaming 

- graphic card : nvdia Geforce rtx 3080 tuf gaming 

For the graphic card alone, my friend advised me to get this offer he deemed excellent. It's in good shape and the airflow is good (multiple be quite fans inside). 

Now, after several tests, it seems the graphic cards does have a good result, but the motherboard/process do not. So i would like to upgrade it so it can be on par with the graphic card. 

I discussed it with my informatician and he told me that in order to change the motherboard, I'd also have to change the processor, the fans, and the RAM. 

What do you think of it ? And what elements (processor, motherboard, ram, fans) should i buy to upgrade my tower ? 

Thank you all, i wish you an excellent end of week ! 

Cheers

# 🧨 Premium Ammo: Because Aiming Is Too Hard

Gold ammo was never “premium.” It was supposed to be a clutch option. Now it’s just what every drooling bot loads by default because aiming is too much work. You’ve got these degenerates firing 330mm HEAT at tanks with 30mm of armor like they’re solving cold fusion.

Why go around a Maus when you can sit in the open, in the exact same goddamn spot *every single game*, and spam gold at the front? That’s what mobility is for, right? Sitting still and brute-forcing the armor mechanic until it stops being a mechanic.

You’ll see players loading shells with **2–3x the penetration** of the armor they’re shooting at, not because they need it, but because *thinking hurts*. Learning? Too slow. Effort? Nah. Failure? Unacceptable. They’d rather pay-to-pretend they’re competent.

And Wargaming? They love this. It’s easy dopamine, padded stats, and more clicks for the spreadsheet monkeys in the monetization team.

# 🎯 Play Smart? You’re the Target

You angle. You bait. You outthink. Cool—now here’s ChadTheTomato42 holding W and pressing 2 with 100% gold loadout. Guess who wins?

Armor is a *trap*. You bring it? You get punished. Want to complete a blocking mission? You’d have better luck asking a gold spammer to read the armor model.

You know who wins? The guy who flattens the map with his wallet and then types “ez” while his 42% WR drools on the keyboard.

# 🧻 Meet the Gold-Spamming Choir of Clowns

Say anything negative and you’ll summon the doofus defense squad:

>

Yeah, so is drowning in your own cap circle, but I don’t see you making montages about that.

These aren’t players. They’re gold-toting tourists on a dopamine trip. Spamming HEAT at low-tier lights like it’s a revolutionary tactic. They don’t play the game, they *buy* a fantasy where they don’t have to learn a damn thing.

And they act like calling that out is a war crime.

# 🤡 WG Support: Kafka Would Weep

I asked a simple thing: *Why was I chat-banned for pointing out that a dude was spamming gold at unarmored targets?*

What did I get?

* **78+ identical, copy-pasted, dead-inside replies.**
* Final verdict? *You mocked a player. That’s unacceptable.*

No swearing. No abuse. Just saying the obvious: HEAT on a WT Pz. IV isn’t “competitive,” it’s clinical brain death. But apparently *that’s* the real offense. Not wrecking the match. Not warping the gameplay. But mocking the monkey who did it.

# 🪦 WG: Where Words Get You Banned and Wallets Win Wars

You want to improve the game? Speak up? Nah. Get banned, get silenced, and get gaslit by the same cut-and-paste support ticket 50+ other people got this week. Check the subreddit. It’s a circus of ignored tickets and corporate deflection.

But if you load HEAT at tier 3 and click red outlines? You’re good. You’re exactly the kind of player Wargaming wants. A drone with a credit card.

# 🗑 Nuked My Accounts. Felt Great.

Every time I came back, I hoped it got better. It didn’t. It got worse. Gold spam in early tiers. Gold duels in high tiers. Missions designed for mechanics that no longer exist. Skill-based gameplay replaced with press-2-to-win idiocy.

So I nuked every account. I stopped grinding. I stopped playing. I stopped pretending this game was ever going to recover. But I didn’t stop speaking up—and I won’t.

# 👊 Final Word: Wargaming Built This Shithole

They didn’t trip into gold spam. They *chose* it. They didn’t silence players by accident. They designed it. This isn’t mismanagement. It’s intent. It's a rigged carnival where skill is punished, stupidity is monetized, and criticism is exterminated.

*World of Tanks* could’ve been the best tactical tank game ever made. Now it’s just a plastic-wrapped Skinner box for the easily impressed.

So here’s your reality check, Wargaming:

* Your support is a joke.
* Your balance team is a myth.
* And your community management? A slow-motion car crash.

But I want to understand why something so simple has ruined everybody's day at home. I (30F) am staying with my parents since I got a remote job during the pandemic, and am on a 1 year career break now due to chronic pain and other health issues I had to take care of. For context, I am financially independent and have enough savings to last me until I start another job, and have contributed to more than half of the expenses at home, and additional medical or shopping expenses for mom until I quit my job and slowly cut down to equal expenses now. I am working on myself and therapy might the only expense I am paying for other than the necessities. One of the biggest reasons I didn't move out and preferred remote work was to support mom, or just be there if she needs me along the day, as her muscle disorder symptoms have progressed over the years (which she initially blamed on me causing stress and not getting married, until she had proof of paper that she got the same genetic diagnosis as her grandmother). Another reason is, everytime I talk about the idea of moving out if I pursue a new job, as it would be difficult to find another remote job again, she asks me not to bring up topics that distress her (as in, me being unmarried is a problem for them, if I decide to live alone after moving out. but i do want to finally start living and form individual routines and lifestyle that suits me best).  

Over the past year, I have made some progress in regulating my emotions (therapy was helpful), and I also started communicating about my symptoms to my mom. She seems to listen, but always sighs if I voice out discomfort in regular things. I keep thinking our relationship has improved, but days like this make me question it. I have been feeling increasingly irritated with the TV sound constantly playing in the living room during dinner and after, so one day I told her I would rather clean things up in the kitchen and hand clothes at that time (usually it's my dad with the TV, but my mom has music on later which is way too loud for me). I could go to my room, but I usually do that when they go to sleep as well, because my parents already complain about the amout of time I spend in my room (locked up mostly).  

But here's why I love staying in my room: even though i have been feeling anxious today, i still had a much better time by myself than when i had to interact with them. I browsed for colorful and ocean themed bathroom designs on pinterest > opened reddit and saw a post of a drawing done by the OP's kid, and someone encouraged them to take the kid to a museum for inspiration > I love museums so I did my usual/annual search of 'must visit' museums and went through the google photos > then went back to pinterest and searched for pastel rainbow themed bathrooms > thought about how lovely it would be to one day have my own house with one of those bathroom designs > felt motivated to clean my room > rushed outside and switched on laundry (everyone's clothes), cleaned all my 4 coffee mugs, cleaned a kettle that has been lying around for months > got the mop to my room > made coffee > next up was supposed to be going back to room for cleaning. But my mom came in and I ended up daying i had my leftover salad from yesterday at 5 am so I will have to make a new one for today. She said ""if you are awake until 5 am, i dont understand why you cant clean your room."" I said, I am finally pumped up to clean and please please don't say anything negative or demanding right now. pleaaase. she said i shouldnt be sensitive to every comment and just do it. I came back to my room, and did nothing.  

So went back for dinner time, made my salad and dinner for dad. And the TV sound ... i just wanted to scream and break the TV, and was internally imagining doing it. I went to the kitchen and asked my mom if I can switch it off if she isnt watching, and she got defensive and said she will watch after cleaning a dish. I said I will clean it up please, you go and watch the songs, I can manage it better if i stay in the kitchen. She was irked, and said ""cant i even watch songs now?"". I said i never asked to not watch, but they are very loud and i cant think or do anything with them, so i want to be away in the kitchen. And when i asked why she cant understand that i just need to be away and i am not making this choice to be irked by the noise, she said she is already putting up with too much because of me.   

This whole discussion ended up being me bringing up that I am just the worst, couldnt even clean my room in 6 months and that she is still okay with me and how any other mother would have flipped out, i brought up the childhood physical abuse my dad inflicted and my just watched and doesnt want to take any accountability and wants the 'best mom' prize, i asked how they expect me to be well-adjusted and perfect when they were doing that (waking me up from sleep everytime they had a fight, and my dad used to thrash me to get a reaction out of my mom, he also threated to pour kerosene on me and a knife). But all of a sudden, I am the reason for all the bad things and that we are the worst family to ever exist according to my dad. My mom once asked me why I didnt question my dad as a kid while he was hitting me, and questioning it as an adult while i was all lovey as a kid (see how perfectly normal their expectations for me are?). I try to be calm, but end up reacting to their remarks and feel like the worst human being in the worst.  

Today, she said I dont do anytjing and dont even cook for myself, so how does it mean i can look after myself? (i do all the chores starting afternoon, and cook my own dinner. she insists on me having the lunch she prepared, but now I am incapable of it). when i asked her if i was not doing every chore possible from the afternoon everyday to the point that she even asks me to stop somedays, she asked me what was I doing to help her all these years before that (i was working 10-14 hours and broke my back, that many facilitated to so many comforts for the family).   

I said I can do much better if i dont have to tag along with their schedule and timings, and she asked me to go out and live. That she thinks i cant do it. I am sure they will have a perfectly reasonable response if i actually move out ..    


Similar things happened many times, but I am so done this time. And the way my mom and dad teamed up to call me crazy and unreasonable today, and acted so holier than thou, like my dad hasnt thrashed me a 100 hundred by the time he was my age (and only stopped 4 years ago when i finally pushed him back and said i can hit him too, but never wanted to stoop so low).  My mom can't go to the hospital withput me because my dad is emotionally unavailable and doesnt understand the kid of support she needs physically, and she depends on me. But always denies that during discusssions like this. She says they have fights but they are good for each other, unlike me. To this day, i shudder and go out to check if they are having a fight everytime i head a thud, but yeah sure they are all good. I want to clean the hell out of my room, get my window and washroom door fixed (something i have been postponing because i am shit scared of hpw my mom will react and pin it on me, and i wanted the 'good times' to last), and move out as soon as possible. I want to live on my own, build healthier patterns in a safer space and prove to myself that i can thrive better on my own (rather than with them or in a shared space like eaelier). I want to take action and not let my guilt or love for them stop me from making a peaceful and free space for me. I want to finally be able to cook whatever i want, whenever i want. I want to rage clean with an open door, i want to have a home that i functional for me (and not 'neat and everything tucked away inside so every process contains a 100 steps even before starting' kind of organization like my mom). I know i might sound immature in my rant, my thoughts are all over the place and today triggered the worst memories - of the things my parents and my abusive ex said or did. I am not what they think I am, and for the first time I don't even want to try and prove it to my parents. I just want to be able to trust myself, and live.

Everything seemed normal until we were almost half way through the flight. I got up to take my daughter to the restroom to change her diaper. When I stood up, I felt a hand on my butt. I glanced at the man and thought maybe it was an accident and kept moving. When I came back, I asked my husband to sit in my seat with the baby so I could use the restroom myself. I came back to my seat and my husband was sitting there looking like he had seen a ghost. He asked me “how long has he been like that??” 

I looked over at the man - his pod door was open - and he was only wearing a t shirt. His stomach was uncovered and his penis was completely out. Stunned, I moved into my pod and immediately alerted a flight attendant. My husband was furious that this man not only was exposing himself in front of us, but also our daughter. Over the course of the next hour, flight attendants came back to yell at him and asked him to put his pants on but he did not comply. At one point he had his hand on his penis and it was clear he was intoxicated. After 3-4 visits from the flight attendants to angrily speak with him, one of the main attendants told him the pilot would turn us around and land us in Alaska so he could be arrested if he didn’t comply. He finally got up and that’s when we realized his pants were in the overhead compartment above my seat. At what point he took them off and put them above us I have no idea, but somehow no one noticed it. 

After he had his pants on, my husband went to have some stern words with a flight attendant and expressed that he wanted the man arrested. The FA told me they were working on filling out a report and mentioned that the man was high status with delta. Once they started serving him coffee to sober up, the flight attendants started being nice to him again. He was allowed to get off the plane in Tokyo and go about his day. 

Delta reached out for a wellness check in, but basically is telling us that we will just have to trust them and that any information related to this case is confidential. I don’t know what to do but I am questioning if I will continue being loyal to delta after this. ",202,1745442341.0,delta,144,0.9,False

1k6a9oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/1k6a9oq/wargaming_killed_skill_in_world_of_tanks_and_then/,Wargaming Killed Skill in World of Tanks – And Then Banned Me for Saying It,"Let’s cut the bullshit: Wargaming took a game that *could’ve been legendary* and pimped it out to brain-dead monkeys with deep wallets and zero self-respect. *World of Tanks* didn’t just get dumbed down—it got lobotomized, monetized, and handed over to players who think “weak spot” is a coffee break.

# 🧨 Premium Ammo: Because Aiming Is Too Hard

Gold ammo was never “premium.” It was supposed to be a clutch option. Now it’s just what every drooling bot loads by default because aiming is too much work. You’ve got these degenerates firing 330mm HEAT at tanks with 30mm of armor like they’re solving cold fusion.

Why go around a Maus when you can sit in the open, in the exact same goddamn spot *every single game*, and spam gold at the front? That’s what mobility is for, right? Sitting still and brute-forcing the armor mechanic until it stops being a mechanic.

You’ll see players loading shells with **2–3x the penetration** of the armor they’re shooting at, not because they need it, but because *thinking hurts*. Learning? Too slow. Effort? Nah. Failure? Unacceptable. They’d rather pay-to-pretend they’re competent.

And Wargaming? They love this. It’s easy dopamine, padded stats, and more clicks for the spreadsheet monkeys in the monetization team.

# 🎯 Play Smart? You’re the Target

You angle. You bait. You outthink. Cool—now here’s ChadTheTomato42 holding W and pressing 2 with 100% gold loadout. Guess who wins?

Armor is a *trap*. You bring it? You get punished. Want to complete a blocking mission? You’d have better luck asking a gold spammer to read the armor model.

You know who wins? The guy who flattens the map with his wallet and then types “ez” while his 42% WR drools on the keyboard.

# 🧻 Meet the Gold-Spamming Choir of Clowns

Say anything negative and you’ll summon the doofus defense squad:

>

Yeah, so is drowning in your own cap circle, but I don’t see you making montages about that.

These aren’t players. They’re gold-toting tourists on a dopamine trip. Spamming HEAT at low-tier lights like it’s a revolutionary tactic. They don’t play the game, they *buy* a fantasy where they don’t have to learn a damn thing.

And they act like calling that out is a war crime.

# 🤡 WG Support: Kafka Would Weep

I asked a simple thing: *Why was I chat-banned for pointing out that a dude was spamming gold at unarmored targets?*

What did I get?

* **78+ identical, copy-pasted, dead-inside replies.**
* Final verdict? *You mocked a player. That’s unacceptable.*

No swearing. No abuse. Just saying the obvious: HEAT on a WT Pz. IV isn’t “competitive,” it’s clinical brain death. But apparently *that’s* the real offense. Not wrecking the match. Not warping the gameplay. But mocking the monkey who did it.

# 🪦 WG: Where Words Get You Banned and Wallets Win Wars

You want to improve the game? Speak up? Nah. Get banned, get silenced, and get gaslit by the same cut-and-paste support ticket 50+ other people got this week. Check the subreddit. It’s a circus of ignored tickets and corporate deflection.

But if you load HEAT at tier 3 and click red outlines? You’re good. You’re exactly the kind of player Wargaming wants. A drone with a credit card.

# 🗑 Nuked My Accounts. Felt Great.

Every time I came back, I hoped it got better. It didn’t. It got worse. Gold spam in early tiers. Gold duels in high tiers. Missions designed for mechanics that no longer exist. Skill-based gameplay replaced with press-2-to-win idiocy.

So I nuked every account. I stopped grinding. I stopped playing. I stopped pretending this game was ever going to recover. But I didn’t stop speaking up—and I won’t.

# 👊 Final Word: Wargaming Built This Shithole

They didn’t trip into gold spam. They *chose* it. They didn’t silence players by accident. They designed it. This isn’t mismanagement. It’s intent. It's a rigged carnival where skill is punished, stupidity is monetized, and criticism is exterminated.

*World of Tanks* could’ve been the best tactical tank game ever made. Now it’s just a plastic-wrapped Skinner box for the easily impressed.

So here’s your reality check, Wargaming:

* Your support is a joke.
* Your balance team is a myth.

We started off as friends with benefits after meeting on a kink (MDLB/femdom) subreddit of all places. It was hard to find people in our area who are into MDLB, so it was a stroke of luck to find each other and to live so close to each other. After I had to graduate college, I called things off because I would be moving away. She said what I feared. She said that she fell in love with me.
It wasn’t a normal friends with benefits. We cried in each other’s arms, spent quality time with each other in addition to the sexual stuff. We shared our trauma and our hopes and dreams. She didnt have a car so I would drive 5 hours round trip to pick her up. When my dad was suspicious of my mileage being so high, I started renting cars just to pick her up and see her. She would stay with me for a few days every couple weeks. I was so happy I finally found someone to experience these things with and actually wanted to be with me. But I wasn’t sure i loved her enough to start a relationship. My last relationship over 5 years ago, I ended up hurting the person who I thought I loved and I didn’t realize it till it was too late. I pushed my ex to do things sexually and basically coerced into doing things until she would do them. It was selfish of me but I thought it was okay because I was having fun. At the time, I couldn’t see how she wasn’t enjoying sexual things. It’s supposed to feel good. I only realized afterwords when she sent me a long breakup message explaining all the things I did wrong, how I should’ve taken “no” as an answer the first time, treated her better, etc. I broke down and felt like someone had ripped me a part. I felt sick and nauseous at how I acted to someone who I said and thought I loved. It messed me up for a couple years. 
Back to my new gf tho. After I told her I didn’t love her like that, she said that was okay and she understood and said we could be friends. That summer, I sent her pictures of the sunrise when I drank my coffee because I thought she would like it. I missed her sitting beside me at times like that. When I went to bed, I thought about her both sexually and non sexually. I just wanted her here with me. After I eventually moved to my new job a month or so later, I texted her and asked her to FaceTime me. I didn’t know if it was the right decision but I thought all of these thoughts had to mean something. So I asked if she wanted to be my gf. She started hyperventilating and I had to calm her down. I gave her a week to decide and she said yes. We were long distance until she moved to my town to be closer to me and find a job near me. 
It was great, I was happy. Until my bad thoughts came in. I have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my adult life and have been on meds at different times. It’s gotten to the point where I think I may have relationship ocd, but even that Im not sure of. I would have the occasional doubt or nitpick something about her appearance mentally. I would stress about little things sometimes until the thoughts would eventually go away. I would stress about her skin and help her to get skincare products and talk about skincare with her in hopes she would use them. I found out she vaped and was hiding it from me when we were apart after graduating. I helped and pushed her to quit and she was so thankful. However, she started gaining weight due to the nicotine limiting her hunger before. Then I started pushing us to workout together so she would lose weight. We have talked about this stuff on and on. I asked if it was okay that I pushed her to lose weight for aesthetic reasons and for health reasons and she said yes. Even she wanted to lose the weight after a while cuz she thought she was getting fat. I don’t know why I do this. It’s like I look for little things to improve and I want these thoughts to stop cuz it makes me feel like a dirt bag and like I don’t love her. I think I love her. I am happy when she is with me, I enjoy living life with her, I want to take care of her and provide for her, I don’t want to hurt her. When she’s had mental breakdowns, I’ve driven at midnight to go to her apartment and console her and make sure she is okay and safe, even with work the next day. I gave her my used vehicle and I bought a new one so she would have a car to drive to work. I pay for most of the meals. I randomly buy her gifts and things that I know she would like if I see them. She still isnt comfortable driving a lot, so I drive 50 minutes round trip to pick her up when she has time to spend a few days with me. I try to be considerate of her and provide for her. I try to give her advice and help her when she has difficulty organizing life and taking care of herself. I don’t want to ever hurt her. I tell her my end goal in life is to love each other fully and passionately until we both die at 90. Spending everyday loving one another and being happy together. 
As we’ve talked about marriage, I feel like I’m getting more anxious. Doubting myself whether she’s the one, whether I love her, whether I’m good enough for her, etc. It’s becoming more of an issue and it’s causing stress between us. It’s forced me to spend more time analyzing my love for her. I’ve broken down crying in her arms cuz I just want all these thoughts to stop and let me be okay. She’s been supportive and understanding but she’s also been hurt by some of the discussion we have had recently and I hate that I am hurting her with all this. We always have gone to each other for comfort and to talk about our issues and comforted one another and helped one another. But it’s hard to do that, when the issue is about her and I. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve started therapy in an attempt to untangle my brain. I feel like I love her, but I feel so selfish in the ways that I push certain changes or act. Our sex life has decreased a lot due to her work stress these last 6 months, and we’ve talked about wanting to get back to the sex life and kink dynamic we used to have but she has gotten upset at times when I’ve pushed it and talked about it. I worry that some of these doubts started when we stopped having sex as much. I’ve just been so worried lately that I’ve somehow convinced myself that I love her to the point where I care about her a lot and I do all the things someone does when they love someone, but secretly I’m still the selfish jerk who only used the other person for sex. I just hate my thoughts and want them to stop. I still look at other women and I hate that I do that. There’s a girl at work that I find attractive that made me anxious but I also worry that was my anxiety or maybe undiagnosed relationship ocd where I was just obsessed with the thoughts about her rather than actually wanting a relationship with her. I worry about whether my relationship is secretly all about sex even though I care about her and love her in many ways outside of sex. Im just so lost and confused now. She went through a traumatic divorce when she was younger. She’s tried to date guys but she never liked them. When she met me, she said she instantly felt safe with me. She’s said I am the best man she has ever been with and that I treat her so well. I always feel like I never deserve those kind words and always feel like I don’t do enough for her. Like even though she believes it, I somehow think I’ve tricked her or conditioned her into thinking that way about me. I don’t want to ever hurt her or ruin her faith in love. I don’t know how I could live with myself knowing I hurt her. She is so kind, loving, affectionate, and amazing. She takes such good care of me and she is so patient with me. She understands my mental health issues and wants to help me through these bad times because I have helped her when she has gone through bad mental health episodes. This whole time I’ve thought I’ve changed from the person who took advantage of my ex. I tried to keep that in mind and make a change and to never hurt someone like that again. But I’m scared that I’m going to realize that I’m still the same person, and I only convinced myself that I was different. I don’t want us to get married and I realize I never actually loved her. I can’t put her through that again. I love her. I just want all these bad mean thoughts to go away and I want to love her as easy as she loves me. I started taking Wellbutrin a month ago, and I want to get off it now due to making these thoughts worse. Lately with my mental stress making me feel depressed, it’s been hard to look at her and feel the love I have for her. Last night, we were watching tv together after I was having lots of anxiety and had to take a walk cuz I was so agitated. I asked if I could hold her boobs while we watched tv. She often lets me touch them when we are just lounging around. I was already starting to feel better after we snuggled because I often feel great when we do that. But when I grabbed her boob, it was a slight but instant ease in my chest and I felt a bit better. When I let go of her boob, my chest tightened up a bit again. Then I laid my head on her bare chest. I felt so cozy, warm, loved, and happy. But then, I got sad. I got sad because even though I felt close to her and loving and warm towards her again, i felt that way after holding her boobs. It just made me play more into the thought that I love her for our kink and snuggles rather than her. Or maybe the feeling I had when I touched her was normal, and it just got me to a point where I could destress and feel the normal loving feelings I have for her. I just want all of this to be figured out. I want to be comfortable with us and happy with us. I’m tired of doubting my love for her and our future together. She says that she thinks it was Gods plan we found one another. Can you love someone and still have these thoughts? I want to love her to the end of time and beyond and grow old together. She’s my rock and she is so valuable to me and takes such good care of me. We share the same morals and politics and values. If I really don’t love her, then I want to know that. But if my doubts and worries are just all in my head, then I want to know that too. I don’t want to make a mistake by staying together or by breaking up. And please don’t just say I should break up. If you analyzed everything I said and think so, then feel free. I just feel like a lot of people on this subreddit say break up because it’s easy for them to say. Thank you.

'll be explained something and have forgotten all about it a week later. I am afraid my colleagues will think I do not care about my job but I do, I really do. I just cannot seem to get anything right. I constantly have to be corrected. It's all stupid stuff too, like forgetting to turn on the coffee machine on time. Everyone else seems to not struggle so much. I cannot really go into any more detail because I would have to reveal recognizable information. I am so tired after a day of work that I cannot imagine working a 40-hour work week in the future. I just don't know how, even though I want to. 

I'm just so drained and restless all the time. Even my mom says I look tired even though I'm not really doing much. I can't even bring myself to study most days, although a few weeks ago I easily studied for 8 hours a day. 

  
I am trying to consistently get up at 9:00 every morning so I don't bed rot and most days I can, but the last few days I have been regressing and waking up later and later. I've been setting alarms at 7:00 again because that is the time I want to consistently wake up at at one point. I also try to be on social media less (my screen time used to be 6+ hours and it's now 4, which is mostly for school and listening to music). 

  
I forget to eat during the day. I keep losing my stuff. I cannot remember the important things people tell me. My self-esteem is so low even though I know it doesn't have to be. I am really easily annoyed as well sometimes, I tend to assume the worst.

I do like myself, I am a kind person, I have empathy and I am smart, but it's just not showing.

1k6a3q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k6a3q4/odyssey_astra/,Odyssey Astra,"**In the beginning, humanity was alone.**

 

Earth was but a speck in the great void of space. An oasis in a cosmic desert. We looked to the stars, and we dreamt and wondered what secrets the nighttime sky might hold. And we asked ourselves; were we truly alone? And like the great explorers of old, we set our eyes to the horizon, the edge of the map, and chose to seek that answer ourselves.

 

Outposts on Mars grew into great domed cities. The toxic, swirling clouds of Venus became foundations for societies in the sky. The asteroid belt, once an obstacle of ice and rock, became a network of trade and travel, as settlers and miners rushed to uncover its limitless resources.

 

Distant moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and the enigmatic clouds of Neptune all slowly became a part of our new Solar neighborhood.

 

And now, when we looked out at the stars, we saw reflections of ourselves.

 

And then, the Beacon.

 

**In the era that followed the Beacon, humanity were explorers.**

 

The Beacon represented more than just proof that we were not alone; it was an invitation.

 

The galactic community, civilizations stretching across the Milky Way, embraced us. We stepped into a broader universe no longer tethered by the gravity of our Sun but instead propelled by our newfound manifest destiny.

 

Technology centuries beyond our own was gifted to us. And our explorers no longer sailed the seven oceans of Earth but the cosmic seas of the galaxy. Faster-than-light travel allowed colonies to be settled on the planets and moons of stars that were once mere points of light in our skies. Worlds once inhospitable were terraformed into new Edens. An age of medicinal advance changed what we thought only theoretically possible into universally accessible cures, and our lifespans doubled, and human population bloomed into the trillions.

 

Our limits had become boundless. Yet, in that boundless pursuit, one undeniable truth remained: the laws of the universe could not be altered. The more we explored and the more we advanced, the more we drew the cautious, defensive eyes of our galaxy. And like the explorers of old, we soon realized our new territories were not always unclaimed.

 

**In the era of exploration, there was turmoil.**

The Milky Way was home to dozens of thriving intelligent species, some hardly older than our own, others having seen the rise and fall of stars, existing for millennia. Our initial welcome into this interstellar community, however, was no guarantee that coexistence was permanent.

 

Humans were unique in that sense. Where other civilizations honed efforts on singular goals - war, exploration, culture, science – we sought mastery for all of it.

 

Some embraced our burning spirit, finding friendship and admiration. They shared their technology, their celestial maps, and their ancient legends.

 

Others, however, began to fear it. Alarmed by the pace of our expansion and breadth of our aspirations, they withdrew from us. Doors once open began to close; their home worlds becoming inaccessible to our diplomats and cultural emissaries.

 

And where fear takes root, conflict all too often follows.

 

**In the era of turmoil, we were soldiers.**

 

There was no true start to the war that would ultimately reshape the galaxy and our place in it. Tensions on distant colonies escalated from warning shots to minor conflicts. Cautious warnings turned into blockades and acquaintances became adversaries.

 

And the idea of what it meant to be human, versatile and ambitious, evolved. Our scout ships were refitted into warships, our satellites repurposed to weapons, and our explorers morphed into soldiers.

 

As the conflicts grew in both ferocity and scope, the shadows of war began to envelop the Milky Way. Alliances formed, battle lines drawn, and diplomacy fell silent.

 

And with it came death.

 

Planets and their populations were wiped clean. Monarchies and royal bloodlines that had lasted thousands of years were ended. Civilizations spanning dozens of systems collapsed.

 

For more than a century the war raged. And humanity and our allies stood resolute. And when battlelines shifted, it was our forces who drove them forward.

 

**In the era of war, we were conquerors.**

 

Conquest has always been embedded in our very essence. Even by the twists of fate that was our evolution, the genetics of humanity crowned us the apex predators of Earth. When we had no other species to challenge us, we turned on ourselves. And when we finally found a fragile peace amongst our own and stretched humanity into the stars, we thought we had suppressed that nature.

 

But in this new arena, our inherent drive for conquest could only be tamed for so long.

 

We took worlds, and the human empire expanded light years in every direction. Our Alliance, six civilizations strong, beat back the dominions of our enemies until they could no longer fight back.

 

**In the era of conquest, we were architects of peace.**

 

It was an uneasy one, for the scars acquired in the Great Galactic War cut deep and its echoes would resound for centuries to come.

 

Yet, after 124 years of war, a historic accord was reached. In the ancient halls of Elysian Vista, the capital city of Cerulia Prime and the former heart of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy had finally found its peace.

 

**In the era of peace, it was time to go home.**

 

The fleets of humanity, after more than a year of celebration and recovery amongst us and our allies, finally charted a course for home; for the territories of Earth.

 

And perhaps the most seasoned of ships amongst humanity’s fleets was the Aurora Dori and her captain, Ethan Orion. Joined by a crew that helped shape the final days of the Great Galactic War and achieved both peace and legend were amongst the last to leave Cerulia Prime.

 

They did not know it yet, but their true adventure was only just beginning.

**Odyssey Astra – Book One**

Earth Date 02.06.2435

 

Water splashed across Ethan’s face as he wiped away the sweat and dirt from the night before. His short, brown hair was scattered, and he ran his fingers through into a respectable enough style. His left shoulder ached, as it had every morning for the past six years, and he rotated it to the sounds of cracking joints. There was a pleasant-sounding buzz that rang behind him, and an orange screen featuring the excitable face of the Dori’s navigator and pilot appeared.

 

“Good morning, Captain Orion,” her voice said at attention.

“Lys. How are you this morning?” he responded tiredly. Lys Arden, from the planet Caelum, smiled at his voice. Her people, the Caelumians, were renowned as the best pilots in the galaxy. Their large eyes stretched to the sides of their light blue, white freckled foreheads. They could process time, as we saw it, faster and react quicker as such. There was no other species you could trust more at the helm of your ship.

 

“I’m ready to head home, Captain!” she said excitedly, her purplish-silver hair curling softly to her shoulders. “The Aurora doesn’t power up as quick as she used to, but all systems are warmed and waiting for your go, sir.” Ethan nodded.

 

“I’ll be up to the bridge shortly.”

 

Lys saluted, and the screen was gone. Ethan took a deep breath and one last look into the mirror. A scar, faded now, ran down from his left temple to his jawline. Though its redness had turned pale over the years, it still burned anytime he noticed it.

 

He stepped into the darkened gray halls of the Dori and faint light filled the hall around him with every step he took. He took a right and made his way into the mess hall. Kael Thorne stood with a coffee to his lips, legs crossed relaxedly and smirked at Ethan.

 

“How you feeling after last night?” he asked. His dark skin blended him into the dimly lit mess hall, his short wiry hair was as cleanly cut as ever, what looked like streaks of lightning were shaved into intrinsic patterns along the sides of his head. Thorne had aged the most noticeably amongst the entire crew throughout their service in the war.

 

Partly from his numerous roles in battle alongside Ethan, but as Ethan suspected, also from the stress he put upon himself to protect the crew at all costs. A close friend of Ethan’s father, the great and controversial General Arthur Orion, he was both First Officer of the Aurora Dori and god-father to Ethan.

 

“I suppose I have to tell you all about last night, seeing as you went to sleep before it even started,” Ethan said with a sly smile and chuckle and patted Thorne on the chest, grabbing a mug and preparing a coffee of his own.

 

“I knew someone on this crew needed a clear mind for the jump. I figured that might as well be the only one I actually trust!” he laughed heartily. Ethan laughed with him.

 

“It’s finally over. Can you believe it?” Ethan asked with a sense of relief in his voice.

 

“I’ll only believe it once I feel the warm sands of the Caribbean back under my feet,” Thorne replied. And he was right. The war was over, but the journey back to Earth would take several weeks and multiple warp jumps. Cerulia Prime and its sparkling, sapphire oceans were nearly 1,500 light years from Earth. Out the floor to ceiling windows of the mess hall, it could be seen floating in the black space outside their ship. Lush specks of tropical green islands dotted its surface, and Ethan already knew he would long for nights in Elysian Vista for the rest of his life.

 

But it was time to go home.

 

“Gentlemen,” a sweet voice called out as Nova Lynx stepped gracefully into the mess hall. Her long brown hair was up in a pony-tail, yet still reached down to her mid back. “I’ve seen that look before,” she said as she walked up to Ethan, cupped his chin, and rotated his head to the left then right.

 

“Easy, Doc,” he blushed. “I’m fragile.”

 

“I’m sure,” she responded as she dropped her hand. “Weren’t you to keep him out of trouble?” she asked Thorne who slurped the rest of his coffee.

 

“Done enough of that for one life-time,” he winked. “I’ll see you on the bridge,” he said to Ethan as he stepped out of the mess hall.

 

“Not too much trouble last night, right?” she quizzically asked Ethan who rolled his eyes. “Not the same as when you are with me,” he responded stepping closer to Nova. She placed her fingers on his chest for a moment, and then pushed him away playfully.

 

“I have had enough nights of trouble in this system. I’m actually quite excited to get back to work,” she said.

 

“Hardly feels real, huh? Heading home, troubles behind us?” Ethan sipped his coffee.

 

“If there is one thing the universe is assured to do, it is to cause those trying to traverse it trouble,” Nova replied. Ethan raised his eyebrows in agreement.

 

“Speaking of trouble, have you and Fix got the engines sorted out?” he asked. Nova rolled her eyes. Fix, or Tala Vex, was the ship’s mechanic and arguably the only brain aboard that could compete with Nova’s. They worked masterfully together on some occasions, but the halls of the Dori often had little room for both of them.

 

“I don’t know. I’m still worried about the energy fluctuations coming from readings of the warp drive. But Tala refuses any of my assistance so perhaps you should check on her yourself,” Nova said crossing her arms. Ethan set down his cup.

 

“Duty calls then,” he said and walked out of the mess hall.

 

“I’ll be in Science Bay if you need back up,” she called after him. Ethan wandered down the hallway towards the engine bay. A loud static echoed out of the room just ahead of him, followed by a loud “Hello?” Ethan peaked into the communication center, a hunched over blond man with spiky hair had his head on the table, pounding stressfully up and down.

 

“Zane?” Ethan questioned. The man perked up and looked back nervously.

 

“Captain! Ahh, sorry about that, just some issues connecting down to Prime requesting permission to warp. I’ll sort it out.” Zane responded; his first name followed by Calix glossed the front of his chest on his collared uniform.

 

“Issues abound today, huh?” Ethan asked sarcastically. To be fair, the fact that the Aurora Dori still flew at all was nothing short of miraculous. The bombardments from stray asteroid fields, explosions from enemy projectiles, the time they flew a bit too close to a red giant going supernova, all had left the outer shell of the Dori dented and its paint faded. But still she flew, the legendary scout ship turned vanguard for the fleet of the United Earth Alliance. And he would captain it until the day it could no longer get off the ground.

 

“Issues, Captain?” Zane asked curiously, always one to stick his nose where it didn’t quite belong. A trait that had gotten him into more than one confrontation (and gotten him out of just as many) during his time as Communications Officer of Ethan’s crew.

 

“Nothing serious. I want to get into warp within the hour, make sure Space Traffic Control on Prime knows we are about to depart before then. Would hate to leave our hosts with an improper goodbye.” Zane’s eyes shifted unsurely to that command.

 

“Right away, Captain,” he responded all the same.

 

Ethan continued down the hallway as a low rumble intensified with each step. Around him, yellowish lights, triggered by his movement, flickered on and cast a transient glow as he passed, leaving a trail of darkness behind him. The doors in front of him quickly slid open and the low rumble turned into the mechanical symphony of the Dori’s engine room.

 

The ship’s warp drive, a spherical masterpiece of engineering dominated the center of the large room. Its seamless surface glowed orange and blue as it warmed up for the coming jump into warp space. Conduits webbed across its surface in white, pulsating light. It truly was the heart of the Aurora Dori.

 

The sound of crashing tools echoed sharply beneath it, and Ethan could hear the muttered musings of the ships engineer.

 

“Hey, Fix!” Ethan shouted over the cacophony of noises humming around the room. Tala jumped up at his voice and banged her head into the under belly of the warp drive. “Jesus are you okay?” he asked as Tala crawled backwards and stood up, hand rubbing her frazzled brown hair as she winced in pain. The right side of her messy bangs was dyed red.

 

“Not the first time I’ve bumped my head into a billion-dollar piece of equipment, actually,” she joked. Ethan gave half a smile and took a look at her head just in case and felt a small bump already swelling. “I’ll be fine, Cap,” she said pulling her head away. “What’s up?” she asked quickly.

 

“It’s time to head home, Fix. I’m wondering if our warp drive here still has the juice left to do so.”

 

“Hasn’t failed us yet, has she?” she responded sarcastically. Tala knew as much as anyone that the Aurora Dori was reaching the end of its operational life. Its hypothetical odometer, if such thing existed for warp-capable scout ships, would be registering in the hundreds of billions of miles traveled.

 

“So that’s a yes?” Ethan asked a bit more sternly. Tala’s nervous smile faded.

 

“Has Nova been saying something about my work again? You know I don’t like when she tries to get involved in stuff she thinks she understands!” Tala began to rattle. Ethan put his hand up and she stopped.

 

“No,” he said trying to sound more relaxed, fully aware of Tala’s innocent but somewhat unpredictable temperament. “But I do want to know if her concerns over the energy fluctuations are something I should be worried about.”

 

Tala’s cheeks began to burn red, and her forehead scrunched. But Ethan’s stern look forced her to keep her true thoughts in her own head. She looked up to the warp drive and then back to Ethan. “The Dori is as sturdy as they come. The fluctuation’s are within acceptable margins. I have run diagnostics and recalibrations multiple times to confirm. She is ready for warp, Captain.”

 

Ethan studied her for a moment, seeing if there were any signs of doubt following the confidence of her statement. “Well alright,” Ethan said as he made a loud clap and smiled. “Let’s go home then,” he said and turned to leave the engine room. He never looked back, but swore he heard a heavy exhale from Tala. Ethan made a note to steer clear of any room that had Nova and Tala in it at the same time.

 

Ethan made his way back through the main corridor of the ship and into a small elevator at the end of the hall that shot him up to the main bridge of the Dori. The doors slid open and into view came the panoramic viewport of the bridge, the stunning backdrop of Cerulia Prime and its distant star on full display. Strategic displays and control consoles lined the room in front of him, casting a soft blue glow as information rapidly scrolled across them. At the elevators exit was First Officer Thorne who stood with a proud smile and guiding gesture, welcoming Ethan to the command deck.

 

There were two rapid thuds as the heavy steps of Rax Juro stood to attention.

“Captain on the bridge,” his deep and raspy voice growled. Towering and imposing, the ship’s tactical and munitions officer was nearly seven feet tall, his face and its animalistic features looking down at Ethan. Rax, a Felarion warrior, had narrow eyes and a flat nose. Sharpened teeth, brown and yellow at their base, rose from the bottom of his mouth. His stiffened blue and golden fur flowed back into long dreadlocks; ears pointed out sharply from the side of his head.

 

Despite his fierce appearance, there was also an air of calm discipline about him. Rax’s people had a troubled past with many other species within the Milky Way. Their beastly appearance and martial prowess had once subjected them to centuries of brutal forced labor by various powers throughout the galaxy. While Felarions were certainly no slaves in that manner to humans, our alliance with them resulted in their conscription in our armies and frequent placement on the frontlines of our most intense battles. While they were happy to be the spearheads of our armies, exerting revenge on many of their ancient foes on our behalf, Ethan couldn’t help but feel remorse for what Rax’s people had endured before finally achieving full independence following the Great Galactic War.

 

Either way, Rax’s place aboard the Aurora Dori ensured that any conflict Ethan and his crew faced, they were guaranteed to have the fiercest warrior on the field fighting by their side.

 

“At ease, Rax,” Ethan saluted, and nodded over to Lys who also stood proudly at attention. Both relaxed back into their chairs, positioned adjacent to each other, facing out towards the viewport. Ethan took his own position between them. He stood encircled by a U-shaped command console at hip height, its surface alive with 3-D star maps and real-time interactive panels and holographic displays that provided him with control of all of the Dori’s systems, from shield integrity to propulsion metrics.

 

“Weapon systems are fully stocked and combat-ready, sir,” Rax reported, his clawed fingers gliding efficiently across his own display panel.

 

“Acknowledged, Rax. Let’s hope they remain idle, and our days of firing them are well behind us,” he responded. “Navigator Arden,” he looked over to Lys. “Are all systems operational?”

 

“Engine room confirms warp readiness, Captain. Awaiting your command to proceed,” she stated with professional pride.

 

Ethan tapped on one of his display screens, bringing up a live feed of the communication deck. “Communications Officer Calix, has STC cleared us for warp?”

 

“Finally got a static filled affirmative, Captain. Cleared for warp,” Zane responded, and the screen flickered off.

 

Ethan inhaled deeply and looked over to Thorne who stood just beyond the perimeter of Ethan’s command display, arms clasped behind his back. He turned his head to Ethan.

 

“First Officer Thorne, it is time to go home,” Ethan ordered, a moment he had dreamt about  for nearly 15 years. Thorne nodded in the affirmative and raised his right arm as an orange display activated over his wrist.

 

“Attention, crew of the Aurora Dori. This is First Officer Kael Thorne,” he announced with authority. “Prepare for warp.”

 

“Navigator Arden, commence warp jump on my mark. Three, two, one…”

 

In an instant, Cerulia Prime was gone. The viewport no longer displayed scenes of serenity but instead a mesmerizing tunnel of lights across the spectrum. Elongated streaks of star light flowed across the viewport as the fabrics of space and time bent around them. Cosmic colors danced around the Dori, as the hum of the warp drive could now be both felt and heard across the entire ship as it propelled them forward.

 

Suddenly, a faint tremor rippled through the Aurora Dori, and Ethan looked around as if caught off-guard. He looked over to Lys, her fingers frantically dancing over her console.

 

“Lys?” Ethan’s voice held a rare note of concern.

 

“Scanning systems, Captain. No sign of—” The Dori lurched violently, throwing the bridge into chaos.  Lights flickered wildly, casting shadows across the crew’s faces. Display screens went red, and alarms began to blare. Ethan gripped his display panel tightly, feeling the ship twist as if in some unseen maelstrom.  

 

He pulled himself up fighting against the gravity of the ship’s rotation and keyed in a series of commands.

 

Then, as quickly as the chaos had begun, the ship stabilized. Ethan looked around the bridge. Thorne was panting, his eyes darting in disarray. Lys, hands covering her head, cautiously peeking out as if she was unsure whether she was still alive. Rax had instinctively reached for his holstered firearm, his other arm placed on his console to steady himself.

 

The viewport was now a dark slate of ebony, devoid of stars or any indication they had arrived at their intended first post-warp destination. Ethan quickly activated the comms display, pulling up the engine room feed.

 

“Tala, report! What the hell just happened?” There was a brief pause.

 

“Uhm,” came Tala’s voice, noticeably shaken. “Working on it, Captain. I… I have no idea. But the warp drive is non-responsive.”

 

Ethan looked over worriedly to Thorne. Concern etched his seasoned face as well.

 

“Sir,” Lys spoke up, and Ethan looked over. “Our maps, they’re… empty,” she said in disbelief.

 

“Empty? You mean malfunctioning?” he asked.

 

“No, sir. Not malfunctioning. They’re just… blank. No readings in in any direction.”

 

“Keep analyzing. I want to know where we are,” Ethan commanded and pulled up the feed of the communications deck. “Zane, send out an SOS now, get us some help out here.”

 

“Roger, Captain. Just one problem,” he said cautiously.

 

“We don’t have room for anymore problems, Zane. What is it?”

 

“There’s… there’s no signal registering around us. It’s like we’re in a dead zone. I’m not sure we can make an SOS right now that is going to reach anyone,” he reported nervously.

 

Ethan’s eyes moved between Thorne and the viewport and the empty vastness of space beyond it. The potential reality of their situation began to dawn on him.

Right?,"I am about to quit a 15 year opiate habit and one of my fears (of the many) is living life sober. My current mentality is that I NEED the pills to have a good night (no matter if I’m sitting home watching tv or hanging out with friends). And this is a very very manageable habit, it’s not like I get really high (even though they’re downers) or they affect my life, it’s more like how someone needs coffee in the morning, but I “need” my opiate at night (only time I take them is when I’m done with the day). 

My question is: I’ll eventually be able to embrace my nights being sober right? 

After that many years, it’s become a lifestyle, so quitting a lifestyle is just as hard as quitting the drug. I’m more scared of this than the withdrawals (I’ve done this once before and not sleeping or being “high” were the two hardest parts, I could manage the body withdrawals).

Thank you for your time.

Recently there’s been 2 small incidents. A while back she took quite a lot of my coffee (I pay for it, she doesn’t drink it) to fill a large thermos for an acitivity she helped host. Coffee is WICKED expensive here and we’re both students. Had she asked I would have said yes, but she didn’t ask which was a little annoying, but I let it slide since I would have felt like a bitch. Then, tonight. She’s hosting a birthday party for a friend of hers. I stayed out of the apartment because I don’t know any of them and don’t like people in general, but came home to find she had taken my chair from my room as a seat for someone. She didn’t ask in advance though I assume she knew how many would come, and didn’t send me a text to let me know she needed it. Once again, it’s not a big deal, but it feels weird not to ask. Especially since I usually keep my room door closed as it’s messy and I like my privacy, which she knows. There was also a bunch of clothes hanging on the chair which she left on my bed. Obviously I get that maybe she had miscalculated the amount of people and realized late she needed another chair, but yeah.

I’m just a little annoyed (also because there’s still a bunch of people here at 10:30pm and we have class at 8:30 tomorrow…). I’m not sure how to bring this sort of thing up because I feel like it might be a ridiculous thing to worry about, and I really struggle with setting boundaries sometimes because I don’t really think people will take me seriously. Any advice?

However, I noticed that whenever the topic of her family was brought up, she would only give a one or two-word response and seemed a little uncomfortable. I would quickly change the subject to something else when this would happen.

I know that a lot of transgender people have problems with their families accepting who they are, or even worse. I didn't want to just assume the worst, but I also didn't want to ignore that possibility and didn't push her about it.

1k69keo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1k69keo/it_is_instant_few_micro_success_stories/,It is instant! (Few MICRO Success Stories),"I have been learning and practising the law since last July. Last month, the law clicked for me.

I understood the difference of Being the One with your desire aka Feeling and Being in the state without needing proof v/s Waiting for it to manifest. It is instant.

Once I removed all the aspects of my old story, released and processed them. Let the old story and my part in it die. I started embracing my new chapter and started strongly with Self Concept. Tbh, for the first I didn't need to believe or  feel it. I just became my assumptions.

My Affirmations for a month were-
1. I am loved and I see love everywhere 
2. I am chosen and appreciated.
3. Everything works out for me and Everything is for my benefit 
4. I am magical, I am everything and I'm the Sun (this assumption came randomly in my head one day while I was using Mirror Method. My old self would cringe and barely get these words out. But I believe this one the most.)

For the entire month. I stayed in this state of belief. I did experience doubts and wavered due to past story moments and I processed them by crying, journalling or simply telling myself its okay.

My successes: 
1. I started to be care for a lot by my friends. Like a lot. For a month, I have been getting texts from my friends telling me they are so grateful for me. One of my friends who is an introvert invited me for night-overs for three-four days in a week. We had movie nights and he cooked for me and we talked all night.

2. I felt so positive all the time. And every time I cried or wavered, the very next day I would see the brightest sun peaking. I stay in Germany and rn the weather has been quite inconsistent. 

3. I received few bad news only to receive better ones later. My doctor appointment for a physio was cancelled only for me to receive an appointment from a better one the next day. I would see my favourite vegetable sold out in my regular market only to find fresher or cheaper options in the next market etc. I would feel drained or demotivated only to see small hopeful nudge in form of a quote or a post


4. I found out a new make up routine which I tried and one of my colleagues said to me, I am shining like a Sun!!!

5. I felt those random silly moments or synchronicities every where I went. I affirmed I see love everywhere and I see couples all the time. Today I saw two birds embracing, a video of two cats kissing on tiktok!?

6. Lastly, my favourite. I was walking just now and thinking how I miss autumn, and I wish it was autumn. And I put on Gilmore Girls soundtrack and was thinking all about Coffees and Autumn fashion, cinnamon rolls basically during my walk I was heavily feeling the Autumn vibe. Near my house there is a BuchSchrank (Free Open book Library) and I went there during my walk to see any books I'm interested in. And behold, saw AUTUMN by Ali Smith. Yes, the book name is Autumn and also, it's on my tbr.

I know these aren't your regular success stories of sp, job etc. But I felt so good when I saw the book. I have been in the state of wish fulfilled of being with my sp as well. So anytime I see a couple my mind goes thats gonna be me and my sp. But yes, super grateful for the Law.",10,1745440299.0,lawofassumption,6,1.0,False

That’s what happened when I randomly reached for [Amber Oud Ruby Edition ](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553)one chilly morning. No occasion, no plans—just coffee, a half-zipped coat, and the vague hope of finding something comforting.



I wasn’t expecting a moment. But I got one.

https://preview.redd.it/gbvwvvym9nwe1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe3faeb09b4d43768a568040d5716cb0405a8e64



#  The Opening – Warmth Without the Wait

From the first spray, [Amber Oud Ruby Edition](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553) felt like drawing velvet curtains in a sunlit room. A glowing swirl of saffron and almond—sweet, but not sugary. Cozy, but not sleepy.

\- Think roasted almonds dipped in amber syrup.

\- Think silk lining on a vintage coat.

\- It’s soft, elegant, and inviting without trying too hard.

There’s no synthetic blast or perfumey harshness. Just warmth and smoothness, like a red cashmere scarf wrapping around your neck. It reminded me of Baccarat Rouge 540—but less airy, more plush.





# The Heart – Jasmine, Light as a Whisper

Twenty minutes in, the jasmine shows up, but it’s not that heavy, heady kind. It’s creamy and sheer, almost like milk blending into warm woods. That saffron-almond glow never fades—it just settles, smooths, deepens.

Outside, in the crisp air, I caught soft wafts of myself—not loud, not cloying. Just this shimmering, golden presence that felt like me, but better. It's that ""your skin but luxe"" vibe.





# The Dry Down – A Scent That Lingers Like a Memory

This is where it gets interesting. [Amber Oud Ruby](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553) doesn’t scream. It lingers.

You might forget it's there… until a breeze hits. Or someone leans in. It becomes this \*invisible aura\*, like a favorite song you hum under your breath.

\- The base? Creamy woods, amber, musk. Not powdery. Not earthy.

\- Just... grounded. Like emotional stability bottled in perfume form.





# The Feeling – A Little Armor for the Day

I reach for this scent when I feel confident. But more often? When I don’t. It’s my ruby armor—quietly powerful, subtly sexy, never demanding.

\- It makes me feel put together when I’m not.

\- Flirty, without being obvious.

\- Romantic, without trying to be.

It's like someone handing you a glass of wine and saying, “Breathe. You’ve got this.”





# If This Perfume Were a Painting…

It would be deep ruby reds, buttery almond cream, and threads of gold.  

Not the shiny kind—but antique gold. \*Warm, nostalgic, glowing\*.  

The texture? Like velvet with a silk slip underneath.

Gender? Honestly, doesn’t matter. This scent molds to your mood.







# The Compliments Are Real

I didn’t buy this for reactions, but… they came.

\- “You smell expensive.”  

\- “Is that dessert? In a good way.”  

\- “Whatever that is, it suits you.”

It’s the kind of perfume that doesn’t \*ask\* for attention—but people notice. The kind that makes strangers lean in with curiosity.







# Final Thoughts – Why It Stuck



I’ve tried dozens of perfumes. Some wow me. Most don’t stick.  

But[ Amber Oud Ruby Edition](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-amber-oud-ruby-edition-spray-100ml?variant=43854650474553)? It stuck. Because it did more than smell good.

It made me feel like the best version of myself—even when I didn’t.

Now, I spray it like a little ritual. Once, twice, maybe three times. Let it melt into my skin. Shoulders down. Head high. Ruby glow activated.





If you want a scent that’s comforting, sexy, classy, and feels like home—without being loud or trendy—this is it. It’s not a “clone.” It’s a love letter to warmth and self-confidence.

Thank you in advance for looking at my query. To start, my manuscript is not finished. I am going to a writing convention next week where I get the chance to speak to literary agents to learn about publishing, and they are requesting a query letter (even if it is unfinished) and the first ten pages of my manuscript. I just wanted feedback for what I have so far.

Dear \[Agent\],

Because of your focus on women’s fiction and thrillers, I’m eager to share with you my upcoming crime thriller, FIVE FEET IN SHALLOW WATER. I look forward to our meeting.

Lucy Delphi is drowning–drowning in the numbness that’s replaced the warmth in her bones, the choking inadequacy when compared to her twin sister, and the rising pressure to catch the serial killer terrorizing the Virginia area, the Stillwater Stalker.

With four victims and no leads, Special Agent Lucy Delphi and her unit struggle to find the killer. Ligature marks on their necks, water in their lungs, and bodies blue and bloated from floating in abandoned pools, one element links the victims together; they all look like Lucy.

When the fifth victim is pulled from the pool and placed on the tarp, Lucy swears she’s staring at her reflection in chlorinated water. But a reflection has ripples; a reflection disappears when you look away; a reflection doesn’t stare back at you with glassy eyes. The dead, wide eyes of her twin sister, Ruby. Neck deep in unimaginable grief, Lucy grapples with the killer being much closer than she thinks–and she might be the sixth victim.

FIVE FEET IN SHALLOW WATER is an adult fiction crime thriller, completed at \[TBA\] words. Influenced by watching true crime documentaries with my mother at a concerningly young age, FIVE FEET IN SHALLOW WATER evokes feelings of tension and fear similar to \[COMP\] and \[COMP\].

I am a 2023 graduate of \[REDACTED\] where I received a BA in English (Secondary Education) and I have been published in \[REDACTED\]’s magazine with a personal narrative about sibling bereavement. Currently, I work as a high school English and creative writing teacher.

I have attached the first ten pages of my manuscript below. Thank you for your time and consideration,

Hannah \[REDACTED\]

(Writing as Hannah Madison)

\-

Five dollars and a few cents, the perfect amount of money to take someone’s life.

""Would you like to donate the rest of your change to combat the teenage mental health crisis?” the cashier asked, ringing up Lucy’s pack of cigarettes and to-go cup of plain black coffee.

Her eyes lingered on the small, dusty jar, with a faded photo advertising a suicide hotline. There was hardly anything inside; a few lone pennies and a five dollar bill sat at the bottom, a measly contribution to aid America’s youth, who were begging, pleading, screaming for help, before they slipped a noose around their necks.

“Sure,” Lucy said before the cashier dropped her change into the jar.

Lucy dug in her bag, rummaging through old receipts, gum wrappers, expired lip glosses, and one overdue water bill until she found a crumpled up ten dollar bill at the bottom of the peeling leather bag. She dropped the bill in the jar and waited. Waited for the cashier to break into a smile, waited for her to express her gratitude for her donation. Something–anything–that told Lucy that her one, small deed made up for the five dollar bill and pathetic pennies settled in the jar.

The cashier looked at the jar, then back to Lucy, her face fixed into one of boredom, a gas station employee who didn’t want to speak to a customer at 10pm. “Thanks. Appreciated. Have a good night.”

Lucy forced a polite smile, shoving her cigarettes in her bag and gripping her coffee cup tightly. “You too,” Lucy snapped, voice shrill.

She glanced at the cashier, stomach twisting. *I don’t deserve to be treated like this by you*, she thought. *I’m better than this. Better than you. How dare you act like that toward me? I am kind. I am generous. I hope you die in a car accident on the way home.*",0,1745440116.0,PubTips,1,0.5,False

I did manage to lose 11lbs at the back end of 2023 but with Christmas just around the corner I put it all back on, and more.


I have become very lazy as of late. I had a monster toothache for weeks and the dental system in my country is in shambles currently. I still cannot get treatment but it's either not hurting any more or I'm just used to the pain now. I've been to the gym once in the last 6 weeks. A couple of times I've seriously considered cancelling my membership as that's money I could use towards my small amount of debt.


But I've been very mentally restless lately about the state of my health. Standing at 5'3"", and weighing 184lbs, all the calculators etc tell me I'm obese, I'm at risk of this and that, my BMI is through the roof. 6 months ago I was telling myself ""come summer 2025, you're all fucked"". Lol now I just look like a laughing stock.


I'm having a small handful of health complaints - nothing major, just more along the lines of aches and pains etc - that I feel could be resolved by leading a healthier lifestyle.


So how can I start tomorrow? It's 9.30 at night where I am so I will be going to bed soon, hence the start tomorrow.


I have no money to go and buy anything until next Wednesday. I am also trying to eat up the remaining Christmas goodies just to get rid of them(it's just a couple handfuls of chocolates in a bowl on the coffee table), then I've got 5 easter eggs that need eating. Money has always been a problem for me so I operate a zero waste policy. I have a lot of products from Aldi's high protein range(predominantly yogurts but some protein bars etc too).


1 thing I know I am going to do tomorrow as soon as I get up - I have a 2L drinks bottle that I'm going to fill up, put some ice cubes in and keep in the fridge. I can drink upwards of 8 coffees a day(all with sugar in). I'm pretty sure I'm dehydrated and that may well be causing some of my health complaints.


So - please - any and all help, advice, guidance... what ever really, would be massively appreciated.

I am thinking about starting a small label local coffee roasting business this summer that is sourced ethically and super yummy. I'm a borderline coffee snob so I enjoy making some good coffee on my espresso machine, and I have a few favorite local roasters.

If I make a local business and try to keep costs low and coffee cheap, AND make a significant percentage of proceeds go to a worthy cause, would you be interested in buying? I think it would be fun to also do collabs with other small businesses and artists etc. Note, realistically the bags would probably be around $20 ish.

I am wondering what people take with them to eat for meals and snacks when they will be out all day. Recipes and ideas are good, but I would really love to hear what your lunchbox looked like today + what you ate when

Context: My schedule for quite a while has been pretty odd- having multiple jobs and doing gig work with unusual hours, doing some work from home, etc and a big portion of my work has been at an actual grocery store, so I haven't needed to pack a day's worth of food for an office in a while and I am out of practice! I am shifting to more of a 9-5 setup with an hour round trip commute and I need to adjust my eating and cooking routines (/lack of) for this

I have a hard time eating a big volume all at once, but I also will forget/be too busy for snacks constantly. I am thinking I probably need a mediumish breakfast (+coffee), morning snack, small lunch and beverage, afternoon snack and beverage, and maybe something extra in my bag if I'm hungry heading home.

1k69cah,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1k69cah/the_secret_of_st_brides_part_one/,The Secret of St Bride's (Part one),"I never thought I’d ever post on an occult forum like this one. No offense obviously, but until recent events, I didn’t think much about the supernatural or magic or ghosts or whatever.

I grew up hearing the stories just like everyone else in Ireland, but as far as I was concerned that was all they were, stories, fairy tales… You know, the type of things you tell children to get them off to sleep smiling.

But something has been happening. It’s so strange and the only way I can wrap my head around it is to say it’s supernatural or magic …or something, some sort of explanation. Either that or I’m going mad.

So, I’ve decided to share what’s been happening to me on this forum in the hopes that someone might recognise what’s going on and help me to stop this from getting any worse.

It all began about a month ago, my uncle Dara had died and my whole family were down at his house sorting through his things. I had always liked uncle Dara, he was a quiet man who liked to collect tech and gadgets, we used to chat about the video games he liked, which to me were really abstract and retro.

I remember him as tall, with wispy brown hair and he wore thick rimmed glasses as he hunched over screens at his office job, jambing figures into spreadsheets for some boring beige corporation. Dara lived alone in a tall, narrow terraced house in Dublin. He kept everything fairly neat, so our task of sorting through his belongings did not take too long.

When we were wrapping things up and preparing for the long drive home, I spotted something in the corner of his living room; a chunky box of discoloured plastic with a face of dust covered blackness; Dara’s ancient Commodore 64. This was one of the earliest PCs and also one of my uncle’s most prized possessions. When it caught my eye it was like time had stopped and I had been transported back to the late 90s and to our frequent visits with mammy to see her brother Dara.

We would leave the damp, boggy, wide open landscape of rural Ireland behind for the damp tarmacadam, concrete and narrowness of the island’s capital city. My brother and I would stare in amazement as our uncle showed us the many computers and gadgets he’d collected. There were clunky 1980’s “mobile phones” that weighed a tonne, ancient Nintendo consoles that seemed like mysterious artefacts and the huge Commodore 64. While my brother only showed interest in the games and consoles, I took a shine to this big old computer. This was not like the computer in our house, despite our computer sporting a comparably fat boxy shape, I could tell that the Commodore 64 was older, its design featured more sharp angles and straight lines and when it was switched on it made such aggressive whirring noises I was always afraid it might explode. I liked how alien, yet familiar it felt. But more than anything, I think I liked it best because I could tell it was my uncle’s favourite too.

When dad patted me on the shoulder I was dragged back into the present and realised I must have been daydreaming for ages.

“Ready to go?”

I shifted the weight of a bag filled with old Nintendo cartridges on my shoulder and responded; “Almost, is it okay if I take one more thing though?”

He looked at me inquiringly and shrugged; “Sure, what?” He followed my gaze across the room to the dusty old computer and rolled his eyes in response.

“Grand, yeah, but I’ll leave it to you to dismantle that thing, I haven’t a clue with any of that technology stuff.”

I nodded with a grin, it’s true, my father had a stubborn allergy to anything technological that was borderline funny… Funny, until you were the one he called into the room to figure out what was going on with the TV or the laptop or the phone or the radio or whatever other unfortunate gadget he was trying to force into submission.

I was still grinning as I lugged the heavy computer and a box labelled “FLOPPY DISCS” to the car and slotted them into a safe corner for transit. I remembered that these “floppy discs” were what Dara used with the ancient computer and that some of them had games on them, so I grabbed them as an afterthought.

When we got home that night none of us bothered unpacking the car, we all crawled into our beds and slept, mindful of the new week of work and school that was waiting to unfold the following day. In fact, we didn’t empty the car until the following Saturday, mam and dad had drove around for almost an entire week with a car boot full of uncle Dara’s trinkets and keepsakes.

That Saturday, after everything had been taken from the car and stored in stacked boxes in the attic or placed around the house where we could admire of make use of it, I finally got around to setting up the Commodore. It did not take long and before I knew it I was pressing the power button and booting her up.

The computer seemed to creak and moan as it whirred its way back to life. First the screen filled with static like a TV which wasn’t tuned to the correct channel. It took a criminally long amount of time for it to boot up. But then, finally it flashed a bright blue screen of life.

From then on I spent several evenings pulling random floppy discs from the box and sliding the flimsy plastic squares into the disc drive. Most of the softwares weren't too interesting, like Omniwriter; a very early word processing software like Microsoft Word… only really basic or Multiplan; a rudimentary version of Excel. *No fun there.* But then I hit a gold mine; the games.

Uncle Dara actually had quite a few and some were actually really good! Like Ghostbusters with its really simple but really cool graphics and that beeping, blooping version of the movie’s theme tune, or Mayhem in Monster Land; a platformer that looks like it was inspired by the Super Mario games.

These and others like them were definitely fun, but after a few weeks and way too many hours playing the same games over and over again, I was bored. I was now reaching for the last few floppy discs sitting in the back corner of the dusty box.

The next disc that I pulled out of obscurity had a scuffed sticker on it with a name written in pen. It said “The Secret of St. Bride's” in a swooping cursive. This piqued my interest. I pulled my phone out and began to google the title, just as I had done with all the other retro games and software discs.

The first thing I found about “The Secret of St. Brides” was a review on an archival website for some 1980s gaming magazine. This obscure, Irish sounding title was actually a video game. Among the few details I had gleaned in this initial casual search I spotted the publisher’s name; ‘Saint Brides School (Ireland)’.

Now this really was weird, video game developers in Ireland? In the 1980s? Surely not. This was **definitely** a **very** cool find… Or so I thought.

Today, looking back, I wish I’d never taken that old computer home. Because, if I am right, then what I did next was the inciting event that opened a pandora’s box of craziness that I really hope can be closed.

The game is just a text adventure, there are no music or graphics. Gameplay features silence and a screen filled with words that players respond to by typing an occasional response.

The opening screen said the following:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Essay*

*THE SECRET OF ST. BRIDE'S*

*A Schoolgirl Adventure*

*by*

*Priscilla Langbridge*

*Copyright St. Bride's School 1985*

*No Cribbing!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

By the way, “cribbing” means cheating or stealing in some old timey slang… I had to look this up too.

Because of what has been happening since I started playing the game this will be the only screenshot I will share. I will also give no direct quotes, any “quotes” I provide will have the wording changed around to prevent any trouble spreading by me sharing what happened to me. I don’t know if this is like a contagion, but I do not want to take that risk.

The story of the game unfolds like this:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You have arrived in the early morning at your destination; a holiday centre where people can experience life at an old fashioned boarding school for girls.*

*You heard about this place from the newspapers and picked up a brochure at your local travel agents. Curiosity has gotten the best of you and you decided this trip might be just what you needed.*

*Following a lengthy journey you are staring up at the tall building that houses this strange place, this is St Brides.*

*Inside is a perfect replica of a boarding school from the early 20th century. Here there is no electricity, no plastic and all of the people there are women dressed in long, old fashioned dresses and bonnets.*

*Besides the strangeness of the place, there also seems to be something that isn’t quite right here… There is a mystery hidden within these walls. You have to solve this mystery, your life might even depend on it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The game continues in this way, immersing the player in this weird type of role playing school, where the people who run the place are referred to as “mistresses” who impose rules and speak in strange old fashioned English, while the paying visitors spend their time pretending that they are “students” at this very strict 1920s boarding school.

The mystery of the game lies with the idea that everything feels a little too real. The player seems to be the only one who has noticed that every person at St Brides is stuck in character 24/7. The other people you come across genuinely believe that it is the 1920s and as the game goes on the player’s grip on reality and the real time slowly slips too.

Gameplay was very rudimentary, I would type in answers to the game’s prompts. For example, in an early scene of the game I was asked whether I wanted to wake any the other girls sleeping my dormitory and bring them on my adventure, or if I would prefer to steal a lamp from one of them. I stole the lamp.

It continued on in this same innocuous fashion, I would enter instructions like “take newspaper” or “N, S, E or W” to go north, south, east or west respectively to move through the house’s corridors, up and down its stairs and through its creaking doorways.

The sound of the mechanical keyboard clicking as I pressed the clunky keys while playing the silent game was kind of comforting. The backdrop of the torrential Irish rainfall outside made the whole experience seem sort of meditative or hypnotic that first evening.

By the time I reached the classroom the sun had set hours before and I had been playing the game in my dark bedroom by the sickly light of the commodore and an anemic desk lamp. I had been too glued to the screen to get off my backside and switch on any other lights.

This was the point when things started to get weird.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You are in a classroom with several tall windows. Rows of wooden desks stand sentinel before a dusty blackboard.*

*On a table you can see:*

* *A cane*
* *A piece of chalk*

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I took the cane, because it sounded like a weapon.

Thus far the game had been fairly dull, there was nothing creepy about it. There was no disturbing soundtrack, no gorey images, nothing that should have made me feel frightened.

But something in the back of my mind creaked, a mild sense of unease was sliding through my mind for some unknown reason. This unease made the cane the most appealing option.

Following this decision one of the “mistresses” marched into the classroom with a fleet of my fellow students following close behind. The game called her Mistress Duff and described her as tall, square and severe with dark, icy eyes.

All pretty standard stuff for a creepy old teacher.

But my mind provided me with a disturbingly vivid image of Mistress Duff. My brain concocted a copy of her so clear, that I could see her dark, grey eyes were flecked with golden-green and that they shone menacingly from the deep sockets in her sickly pale skin. I saw her dull brown hair had been scraped back into a bun, partially concealed beneath an aggressively frilly bonnet. The smell of chalk and moth balls filled my nostrils and I felt an anxious nausea rise to my throat. Her looming height cast a shadow across my mind that I just could not escape.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Mistress Duff sees you. You cannot escape. The other students stare.*

*“THAT IS MY CANE, YOU FILTHY THIEF!”*

*Mistress Duff grabs the cane from your hand.*

*“YOU NEED DISCIPLINE. ST. BRIDES WILL TEACH YOU TO BE A PROPER LADY.”*

*Mistress Duff beats you with the cane.*

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My vision swam and what had previously been the distant mental images of daydreams transformed into true sight.

I was **in** the classroom now.

My heart hammered in my chest as my actual eyes **saw** Mistress Duff’s face twist and sour. She peered down her nose at me with an imperious air and a hatred I had never experienced before.

I watched as she crossed the room towards me. When she grabbed the cane, I felt the palm of my hand sting with a sensation as though something had really been ripped from my grasp. I gasped and whimpered as I heard the ancient desk screech when I was pushed to lean over its side. I felt her vice grip on the scratchy fabric that made the school uniform I was now wearing.

Then the pain came. The stinging at the top of my thighs and across my bottom. It was almost as if I really was being hit with a wooden cane. I reddened with mortification, corporal punishment does not exist in modern Irish schools. It has not been an accepted form of punishment for a very, very long time. The only ideas that bounced I had about it stemmed from historical dramas or the tales my parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents would provide of their time being educated by priests and nuns in the olden days.

Then, as quick as it had happened, it was over. My vision cleared, I was not in a classroom in a creaky old boarding school, I was back in my dim bedroom. The first thing I did was to look at my hand; not a mark on it, then my backside, also spotless. But the pain lingered on both, the anxiety and nausea had remained too. The only theory I could think of was that I had been hallucinating, maybe I was a lot more tired than I had previously thought. Or perhaps I had a far more vivid imagination that I had ever given myself credit for.

Either way, after that, I did not touch the Commodore 64 for a very long time. I went to school, hung out with friends and just got on with life. Most of the time the memories of my strange experience stayed pushed away from my consciousness, but sometimes, at night when I was trying to drift off to sleep they would slam into me and refill my head with a flood of anxiety.

That March had been a record breaking month for rainfall. Some parts of Ireland, the UK and Europe had experienced flooding. We had been lucky that the river running through our little midlands town had remained within the bounds of its banks. 

When the month came to a squelching end and April took to the stage we experienced the first dry day in what felt like forever.  It had been over a month since I’d turned off the old computer and left it to gather dust. 

The trouble started on a Saturday.

I had been rudely awoken by a loud slam followed by an unpleasant crunching noise. My eyes flashed open and I twisted in my bed, legs flailing as I wrapped myself in a straightjacket of sheets. I tossed my head from side to side and my eyes were wide and staring as they took in the safety of my messy bedroom. Letting out an exasperated huffing sound I quickly calmed down and my heart rate rattled to a normal pace. Once I had untangled myself from the sheets I walked to my window and took in a tiny crack at the centre with an even tinier splotch of red that was slowly spreading into the crevices of the chipped glass.

After grabbing a hoodie and pulling on shoes I headed down the stairs, through the kitchen and out the back door into the soggy garden. The sun cast an anemic disk of watery light through a heavy curtain of sodden steely-blue clouds. And there, below the window on the cold concrete was a tiny, delicate, dead bird. Its neck was lying at an unnatural angle.

Sadly this is kind of common, little birds like this sometimes fly into the windows of Irish homes. But this bird was in worse shape than the others I had seen to have died this way. First, its skinny little legs appeared to have been snapped, it was not possible to tell what breed it was because its feathers were so soaked with bright red blood (not typical of bird-window deaths) and the worst part was its beak, the bottom half was gone, seemingly ripped from its face with force. I felt last night’s dinner resurfacing and I gagged, turning away from the tiny carcass. My thoughts went to the neighbourhood cats first, perhaps they had been at the body before I had made it outside and that was why parts of the bird were missing and it had bled.

This was when I noticed the silence in the early morning garden. Normally, our garden would be filled with birdsong from the crack of dawn, but at that moment there was nothing. Nothing except for the increasing hiss of white noise. I recognised the huffing monotonous sound because my mother plays it sometimes to help her to sleep. From the moment that I noticed the noise the unknown source seemed to take this as encouragement and grew louder and more insistent.

I turned to look around the garden which stretched down a gentle slope to terminate at a tall brick wall cloaked in ivy. I don’t know what I was expecting to find as I scanned the flower beds and my eyes followed the path down the slope. But I definitely was not expecting what I discovered.

At the foot of the garden, several metres away was a figure. They seemed to glow with a faint blue-green light that emanated off its form.This figure was translucent and dressed in long dark grey robes and it had an ugly, frilly bonnet perched on the top of its head. I recognised it from my nightmares straight away; Mistress Duff. She seemed to be flickering in and out of existence like damaged film being projected onto this world. My heart stopped when I realised what she held in her large, bony hand; a lengthy piece of wood, dripping lurid red blood.

The muscles in my arms and legs turned to mush and I stared breathlessly at the horrifying visage menacing my back garden. After an eternity she turned very slowly and took a step deeper into the unmowed grass, then another. With each step the flickering increased. When she finally reached the brick wall at the garden’s end I watched her slowly passed through the grey bricks, inch by inch with a flickering, blue glow that horrible created walked through the wall and out of my garden.

I remained paralysed for an age. The feeling in my body only returned when the cold morning air provided muscular aches and sent me shivering inside the house.

I told my parents about the bird and my father buried it somewhere in the garden. They also found the tiny creature’s state upsetting, but, like me, presumed that it must have been at the paws of the local cats.

I did not mention the ghostly figure of a 1920s school teacher at the bottom of the garden. I knew what they would think. Mam would worry, she’d fuss about me and express care in annoying ways like by extolling the virtues and importance of taking your vitamins every morning. She would say that I was just run down and insist that I ate an unnecessarily large portion at dinner until whatever storm was plaguing me seemed to pass.

Dad would worry too in the silent, simmering way of Irish men. He wouldn’t say anything but I would occasionally catch him looking at me with concern, before he’d grunt and look away. I knew that they would both think that I had lost my mind.

To ease my own thoughts, I convinced myself that I had been caught in a sort of waking dream, that when I had been knocked awake by the loud noise I had been in a deep REM sleep and in the clutches of a very, very vivid dream. I told myself that I saw those strange things because I was dreaming. I ignored the morbidity of the dead bird’s state and refused to acknowledge the grisly trail of blood that the ghostly thing left in its wake.

That weekend drew to a close and Monday brought a return to my classes at university. I shuffled from one lecture hall to another, nursing paper cups of coffee to stay awake. I had not slept much since the incident with the bird and flickering visitor.

I spent time with friends, tried my best to have fun. I even managed a genuinely laugh at their jokes occasionally, but I was not myself.

No one really seemed to notice though except Molly. She and I had been fast friends since the earliest week of our course. She was funny and clever and genuinely cared about the people in her life. It was pretty hard not to like her. We had bonded over music and books and cinema. People often joked that where one found Molly they often also found me and visa versa.

Later that week, after a particularly dull lecture Molly and I tucked ourselves into a corner in an on campus cafe. When she asked me what was wrong I was not surprised, but still felt a spike in anxiety that I was noticeably “off” and she had spotted it.

“Not sleeping much,” I confessed.

She dug for more information, her face clouded with concern. I was grateful to have someone checking in with me and caring that I was doing okay, but it didn’t change that there was no way I was going to open up about video game hallucinations, mutilated birds and flickering figures haunting my family’s garden.

Despite my secrecy, speaking with Molly did actually made me feel a little better. Maybe soon all of the events that had taken place those past few weeks would fade into a distant memory.

Unfortunately, that was not the case and there was more to come.

That evening was when the first message appeared. I was slouching in the back of a lecture hall, trying to listen as the professor as they droned on. I was scribbling notes and after I had filled one page I turned it to continue.

I dropped my pen.

On the centre of the next page were the following words;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This was the prompting message from ‘The Secret of St. Brides’.

Why was this showing up in my notebook?

I must have written it and forgotten. That was the only logical explanation. I ripped out the page and battled my nerves away from the precipice of an oncoming panic attack.

I turned the page again and tried to resume note taking, but what I saw was another unsettling message scrawled across the paper;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You have to solve the mystery, your life might even depend on it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The messages began showing up everywhere after that.

Statements from the game appeared on scraps of paper slid into my locker by unseen hands and inside all of my notebooks.

I really began to question my sanity when I saw both messages in the middle of the news articles I read on the train to the city or between the pages of course textbooks. The words appeared on TV screens and in advertisements like cryptic messaging.

Not subtle.

One day, I took a risk and decided to draw one of my friends’ attention to it. We were walking down the street past a billboard that featured a smiling family who were lounging on the new and shiny garden furniture the advertisement was touting. In the top right hand corner were the words that were all too familiar; “You have to solve this mystery, your life might even depend on it.” I turned to my friend and pointed out the strange messaging.

I honestly wish I’d never asked them. I already harboured a fear that no one else could see these messages, but to have it confirmed was almost too much to handle.

My friend looked at the billboard, looked at me and let out a confused laugh. Luckily they brushed it off as some strange joke on my behalf, that maybe they didn’t get my odd sense of humour, but the frown between their brows bothered me.

Great. Now they think I’m mental.

These assumed supernatural events or psychological breaks continued to escalate.

One day, as Molly and I were walking through college, I saw the flickering figure of Mistress Duff moving through a crowd up ahead. She drifted straight through my classmates’ bodies. I knew in my gut that her goal was singular, she was heading straight for me. I don’t remember much. My mind was filled with deafening silence, sickly green bled into the edges of my vision and I lost any sense of existing within a physical body. It felt as if I had slipped out of my skin like I had shed a heavy coat. The feeling of weightlessness came with a tsunami of nausea and I felt my eyes roll sickeningly.

Molly says she had turned and to see me stop suddenly, all the colour had drained from my face. She told me that I was shaking and my teeth chattered inside my skull. I collapsed shortly afterward and people ran to pick my crumpled form from the ground.

I was unaware of everything except the ghostly figure which was drawing closer, stretching its enrobed hand and bony fingers towards me.

I wish I could say that I kicked or punched at the glowing mess, I had lost any sense of myself or of time and lost consciousness.

I was ferried home by concerned friends and spent several days after convalescing in a silent sulking state alone in my bedroom. Mam and dad are worried, but presume it is exhaustion or burn out from college. It is easier to let them believe that.

The fear that Mistress Duff’s flickering form will one day manage to reach me has been picking at the frayed edges of my mind, pulling it asunder more with each day.

With the notes and hallucinations also came the nightmares. Horrible visions of empty rooms in an old, rotting house and echoes of the thud of that helpless bird against my window blended with the screech of something being scraped down a blackboard.

The dreams featured the sound of distant screams and the thwack of wooden canes as they snapped upon bodies. These noises and sights have stayed with me throughout the day and nag at my sanity. It feels like every time I close my eyes, they are there waiting to haunt me.

My sleep is broken and my appetite is minimal. But I am still trying to go to class. I have started speaking with a therapist at the university.

Initially I had hoped the therapist would diagnose me with some condition which could explain why I was seeing these things. But deep down I know that it wont work… Not when what is really wrong with me is beyond what any of us could understand.

This is what brought me back to this horrible game. The impact of refusing to play is that in both my sleeping and waking life ‘St. Brides’ is haunting me.

That is why I am here. I need your help. Please if any of you know anything about this old game from the 80s, the St Brides School or how to get rid of these things that are tormenting me then please, please let me know.

But **please**, do **not** play the game. Please, please do not subject yourself to this.

I posted this to no sleep first. It was removed within 10 minutes by a moderator. They have informed me that I am not allowed to repost it even if I do make changes. So I guess it will only exist here and I will update here instead.   
I'm pretty sad about it, I was so excited to participate in the community, now I am so disheartened I don't think I'll consider posting anything else there either to prevent the disappointment of having it pulled with no info as to why :(

1k69bz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1k69bz9/a_moral_being_gains_realitywarping_power_claims/,"A moral being gains reality-warping power, claims they use it benevolently and for the greater good...but there are cracks in their actions that betray them.","Dr. Maruki of Persona 5 Royal is a fan-favorite villain and it's not too hard to see why. After Yaldabaoth's defeat at the hands of the Phantom Thieves Maruki is able to take control of Mementos and essentially gains the ability to overwrite reality in whatever way he wants, and how does he chose to use such power? By trying to make a world where everyone can be happy and no one has to suffer or be in pain anymore. He is a genuinely good man who does sincerely want to make the world a better place. He truly has no malicious intentions, nor does he want to fight the Phantom Thieves, greatly preferring to convince them of his argument rather than force them to accept it like he has the ability to do so. Even if you disagree with his methods or mindset it's hard to not be at least somewhat on his side, and as we saw firsthand throughout the game there are SOOOOOOO many people where them having the same power Maruki does would be an absolute nightmare scenario. There's a reason the player is given the option to side with him and have the game's ending be the reality he creates.

However, likewise there are reason both the game and the fans themselves have for siding against him. One of the big ones being that, for all of his good intentions, Maruki himself is not a flawless being and thus him having so much absolute power is dangerous.

Weirdly, my most immediate comparison is the contract from The Fairly OddParents: School's Out! The Musical:

>""In return for making the world what you want...yadda yadda yadda...Pixies get the power...yadda yadda yadda...Earth will be safe and fun *as defined by Flappy Bob.*""

Reality will be overwritten by a new one where no one goes through any more pain and thus everyone will be happy. And who defines what pain and happiness are? Dr. Maruki.

Someone has a troubled past? Regardless of whether they've moved on and made peace with it, Maruki makes it so that the troubles of their past never happened, and likewise any growth they had from dealing with it.

Someone is faced with a tough decision or very challenging dreams? Maruki will change them so that they'll be content with taking the easier path in life or so that they never desired their dream in the first place.

One of the biggest brought up is Sumire Yoshizawa, one of the first people whose cognition Maruki altered even before he gained his reality overwriting powers. She felt inferior to her sister Kasumi for so much of her life and then felt crippling guilt when Kasumi died saving her from an oncoming car. Maruki's solution to helping Sumire wasn't to bring Kasumi back to life like he did for Futaba's mom or Haru's father, even after he took control of reality, but rather to make Sumire believe that she IS Kasumi and that it was Sumire who died instead. Why? Because having Kasumi back in her life would still be causing Sumire pain via her feelings of inferiority to her. Sumire felt so much envy towards her sister and sometimes felt like things would be better if she'd been the one who died instead, so this was Maruki's solution, to turn Sumire into Kasumi. Her feelings of guilt over Kasumi's death are gone and she gets to be the perfect sister instead of the lesser one, and thus Sumire is happy...all it took was essentially the erasure of Sumire Yoshizawa. Maruki's solution to Sumire's problem was basically ""If your unhappiness is because you think the world would be better off without you, then I will remove you from the world and make you into someone else."".

But for the sake of argument let's put all of that aside and say that Maruki does have the perfect definition of what happiness is. That still leaves one very notable crack in his armor that I don't see talked about as much, and that is Masayoshi Shido.

Shido is one of the main and most important villains of Persona 5, not only being the one who ruined the main character's reputation as retaliation for daring to stop him from sexually assaulting someone but he's also a corrupt politician who is directly responsible for the many cases of mental shutdowns and deaths that occur throughout the game's story, all with the goal of increasing his political power. Naturally, all of this made him an enemy the Phantom Thieves worked to take down, even if it meant Joker himself having to turn himself over to the police as the leader of the Phantom Thieves in order to testify against him.

In Maruki's rewritten reality however, such testimony from Joker isn't needed. Shido is in prison for all the crimes he committed.

Why is this significant? Because it's different from what Maruki did with the other villains the Phantom Thieves dealt without throughout the game.

In Maruki's new reality, Kamoshida never did any of terrible things he had in the old reality. No abuse, no sexual harassment or assault, no breaking up the track team or Ryuji's leg. Madarame not only never steal the work of his students but his personality was altered to turn him into a genuinely good teacher that his students like Yusuke could trust. They no longer are bad people who had done bad thing...but Shido still is. They are living just as happily and pain-free in the new reality Maruki created...and yet Maruki seems to be specifically excluding Shido.

Maruki claims he wants to make a reality where everyone is happy, yet Shido is being punished in his new reality. Either the crimes Shido committed still happened, including the deaths and pain he caused, in order for Shido's incarceration to be justified, or the crimes Shido committed never happened and thus this reality's version of him is an innocent man who is being unjustly punished for crimes he didn't do. You can't even make the argument that Shido wouldn't be happy if he didn't do all those things or wasn't the kind of person who would want to do those things since Maruki altered the personalities and desires of other evil people without any issue, nor is it likely that Shido was somehow too evil to be altered since even the Phantom Thieves were able to do it by just simply stealing his ""heart"", which caused Shido to be overcome by such overwhelming guilt for all he'd done that he confessed on live TV to all his crimes.

Even creating a paradox isn't really an issue. The Phantom Thieves came together and became friends one after another because of the problems and villains each of them faced in their lives, which were never a thing in Maruki's rewritten reality, and yet they all still are together despite how it makes no sense that most of them ever would have met, which is even acknowledged by the characters themselves. Ryuji directly says that he can't remember how he knows Joker or how they became friends. They're all together despite how there was no actual cause to such an effect simply because that's how Maruki wants reality to be.

So Maruki has the power to make it so Shido never did any of the terrible stuff he had and to turn him into an upstanding and happy member of society who never would do anything like it, with no negative consequences due to unforeseen butterfly effects...but he doesn't.

Why? Because Shido wronged *him*.

Shido stole Maruki's research on cognitive science and used his influence to keep Maruki from further pursuing it, dealing a major setback to Maruki's goal of trying to help the world. That is the only difference between him and all the other villains of the game. All of the villains hurt people, but Shido specifically had hurt Maruki, and thus Maruki decided that he doesn't get a happy life in the new reality he created.

For all the good and happiness Maruki claims to want for everyone, there is at least some part of him that wants to get back at Shido, be it for what he did to him or to others or both. Some part of him that decided that Shido doesn't count as part of the everyone who deserves a life without pain and heartache.

This whole thing reminds me of the original Marvel Secret Wars story from 1984, where Doctor Doom managed to obtain the seemingly infinite power of The Beyonder. Upon doing so he makes peace with the heroes, claiming that with the godhood he has just been granted he is above all the previous grudges and conflicts of his old life, as conquest no longer means anything to him anymore and thus he has no reason to fight with them anymore. He is beyond mortal concerns and desires now and thus above mortal folly. But the heroes aren't entirely convinced.

They do certainly want to believe him. Captain America even talks about how he finds Doom's desire to use his new power to save his mother's soul from Mephisto to be very noble and under most other circumstances he'd volunteer to help him. But that's also the exact issue. Doom's actions and future actions are not lining up with his words. He claims he is above human desires now...and yet the very first thing he did with his reality-warping power was fix the scars on his face. Wanting to save his mother is not at all a bad thing but that is still a *want*. A desire that stems from when Doom was still human.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like it's inherently bad to use power for personal benefit. Even Superman uses his heat vision to heat his coffee sometimes. But Superman isn't claiming to be above mortal folly or that he's completely wise and benevolent. Quite the opposite in fact, where in many of Superman's stories he makes it very clear that he is NOT inherently special or better than anybody else. ""I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard."" isn't just in relation to him having to be careful to not rip off doorknobs or people's arms. Someone with his level of power can do an unfathomable amount of damage to the world and the people in it if he just goes around assuming he knows better than everybody else. Superman forces himself to be patient, to listen, to be diplomatic, to hold himself to a higher moral standard because if he doesn't who else will? Who else even could?

And the power Maruki and Doom command is *significantly* beyond what Superman has even in the most generous of battle forums. Nothing exists in the universe now without their approval, and so them thinking that they are the ultimate authority on what is good and best for everyone, thinking that they are above being biased or even just simple pettiness and vanity, is a VERY bad thing.

Secret Wars had a semi-sequel in 2015 (also titled Secret Wars...) where Doctor Doom saves what he can of the multiverse when the Beyonders cause it to be destroyed, taking their power and using it to reconstruct a new reality under his rule out of all that he saved. He is the benevolent hero god...and the very first thing he did with all his power and control was replace Reed Richards with himself.

>Doom: ""You think power makes impossible choices more palatable? I have always had power, Reed. Nothing has ever been easy.""

>Reed: ""You know what's not easy? Having your life erased because someone wants to indulge themselves. You made yourself god and the first thing you did was replace me.""

>Doom: ""The first thing I offered was salvation.""

>Reed: ""YOU STOLE MY FAMILY.""

In the 1984 Secret Wars, when the heroes vote to confront Doom to convince him to give up his power he instantly annihilates them with a bolt from the blue, despite the fact than none of them would be able to do anything to him. It took everything Doom had had and then some, like syphoning power from Galactus and willing himself back together when The Beyonder took him apart and dissected Doom on a molecular level to study him, in order for him to beat The Beyonder and take his power. The heroes can't possibly replicate that and he could easily just send them all back home to Earth with no hope of ever even finding him again. But for daring to question him, and because of his fear of losing all the power he now has, however small the chance, Doom instead killed them all, still referring to them as ""my enemies"".

None of this is to say that Maruki and Doom are bad characters or bad villains. Far from it. But in the words of the great philosopher of our time Garfield Arbuckle: ""You are not immune to propaganda."". It isn't just the fact that they have so much power that makes them dangerous, it's that they have all that power paired with a denial that they have any personal biases that can and do influence how they define good and thus influence how they use their power in the name of good, and those biases create the cracks in their seemingly perfect benevolent worlds.

Dr. Maruki's whole philosophy about taking way pain and hard choices in order to create happiness is based in his inability to move on from the hardships of his own life; hardships which he feels enough resentment over to single out someone he holds as responsible for some of them. Doctor Doom's egotism makes him see the only good and perfect world being one that he has control over, yet paradoxically his insecurity keeps causing him to sabotage the good he could do. 

>Doom: ""All that I have done--all of this--and you still give me no credit. Can't you accept that I have done good things here?""

>Reed: ""I'm not blind, Victor. I do accept it...but you could have done more. You closed your hands around everything that was left and called it yours. You're so afraid of losing the things you save that you hold them too tight. Don't you see, Victor? A tree is just a seed in its realized state.""

>Doom: ""This is what always causes your fall, Reed. Abandoning the good because you desire the perfect. I understand now. I know what this is. It's the same thing it's always been between you and I......*you think you are better than I am*.""

>Reed: ""No, Victor. You're wrong. I've always believed you could be better than you are.""

>Doom: ""No, I mean now. This moment. If you had this power, you think you could have solved it all. Solved everything. You think you could have done SO...MUCH...BETTER... Don't you? DON'T YOU?!""

>Reed: ""Yes. And we *both* know it, don't we?""

>Doom: ""...Yes. Damn you...""

The creation of a perfect world would require a perfect being to be its creator, and no one, no matter how much power they gain, can be that. We all have our own POVs, our own biases, our own preferences, our own flaws and imperfections. That absolutely does not mean that those with power shouldn't try to use their power to help others or to try and put more good in the world. But when you refuse to get a second opinion and see only your own definitions of right and wrong as correct that can leave you very blind to the harm you cause. Having power doesn't inherently make you right, it simply means that nobody can do anything about it if you end up being wrong.",33,1745439716.0,CharacterRant,5,0.97,False

I am an albanian that has lived in the US for 28 years and found a job in Albania that pays €3k a month. 

Currently i have a good job in the US but am not seeing the motivation to stay here much longer and want to bring my wife and kid closer to the european way of life. I understand the political issues that are aligned with the country but there are several things the country does/promotes well including family structure, walking and social activity, safe communities, close proximity to europe etc. 

I read posts from albanians in this community all the time and it seems there is so much dislike from the community about the country. In my opinion going to Albania with this sort of wage is manageable even with a wife that is not working and will be taking care of our toddler. In the US there is a lot of stress and issues with everyday life that i see a problem with and leads to multiple mental breakdowns each year.

I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same.

* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

I am pursuing my studies here in CANADA and graduating. I left Philippines and I drop in my first year because my parents told me to.

This forum is not meant to scare you but to be ready for reality you are facing with

TIPS:

1.	⁠Remind yourself that making friends here is different in your typical SHS. Accept that one by one there will be an elimination round. Drop out, people realizing this career is not for them, switching degree program, nabuntis, financial difficulties, etc. Making friends is fine as long as you are not emotionally unstable. Make friends who can balance both your study and fun nights. Eventually when you see some señior 4th  year ang onti na lang nila. My kuya became friends with the people who dedicate to spend their 4 years even though nung first year niya hindi niya akalain na magiging kaibigan niya yun. Its  more common

2.	⁠There is no such thing as homeroom teacher. You can do as you please. There will be different professors.

A. They will teach you a subject unit within that day do not expect na babalikan ng teacher yung topic unless it is discontinued. Most of them will give you a powerpoint slides and basically you should Self study half of it. Huwag mong i-asa sa professor na ""Hindi naman tinuro"" That is not the case. In universities. Modules and lessons are already pre-written its up to you to advance study before lessons.

B. You cannot self absorb a topic that has been discussed today. Its not high school anymore. Teachers will teach and expect you to retain them. Its either you will study more than that. Take notes, take pictures, write down something.

C. There will be a schedule where you only have to attend two or one subject in one day. You can study in a library, eat outside and even go to mall. Your time your choice. There will be a schedule where you first class starts at 1:00 PM and ends at 8:00 PM. Under a year you will see your school both in early morning and late at night

D. If you plan to absent, makipagkaibigan ka muna so you can reach out to someone who can give you details on what happened the day you left

E. From elementary to SHS its common to see competetiveness like grades. Recitation is useless. At the end of the day your quizzes, exam, and paperworks are more important. Performance task are not the ones to grade but your paperworks. It will be more common

F. Professors can Fail you when you least expect it. If bagsak ka sa subject there is a possibility na uulitin mo yung course sa summer or next year and you have to pay again.

Meaning: since next year mo uulitin yung bagsak mong subject yung classmates mo is upcoming freshman and yung mga classmates mong nakapasa is second year na and ikaw knowing na second year is may mga classmates kang freshman.

How does it feel if you are that person?

G. Private or Public Universities it can be expensive Be ready for:

1.	⁠Uniforms, unnecessary t-shirts, lanyards, ID, coat, and other expenses. If you pursue engineering expect art materials to spend. If pursuing medical courses, expect to spend medical equipments. Gastos Gastos Gastos. Its necessary and common.
2.	⁠Eat outside. Your classmates will rarely ""BAON"" your lunchables might not exist. Most of them will eat outside, you may be more influenced to do this. If your schedule is hectic there are some first year who will eat after uwian or some of them will do heavy meal before going to class. Also your lunch period might be 2:00 PM, 1 PM, etc.

Common sense kung lahat ng estudyante at 12:00 ang lunch oh edi nagsiksikan kayo sa cafeteria.

There will be subjects taught in 12:00 to 2:30 PM, yung professor mo nagtuturo tapos ikaw nagmamaktol na gutom. Your professor is probably hungry too but they are doing sacrifice so suck it up.

H. Facebook's black market There will be some students selling their books, uniforms, P.E. Outfits,equipments and etc. Yung iba nag book-bind kasi di afford. I don't recommend you doing that purchase books first. Tell your parents you have so many expenses so you can opt for other option.

I. Absences.

1.	⁠If umabsent ka sa day ng exam sa university, you will undergo special exam and expect you have to pay. I paid 1200 pesos. 400 pesos per subject unit. Worth it. I have aced my exam kahit gumastos ako.
2.	⁠Absent ka? No one will notify ypu what to do. May professors na sesenyasan ka and attendance is a must. Hindi yan magtuturo ng buong oras para sayo. Your professors are being paid to ensure that all courses and lessons are discussed.

J. Expect going home  arriving home late.

Its hard to be honest but for me its fun since I am not doing this alone. Study all night and RED BULL and COFFEE is your study partner

Remember that your professors will push you when you are third year and forth year. You should have good relationship with them

Subukan mong bastusin prof mo First year pa lang. They have less expectations for you

Your professors mararamdaman mong magulang sila kapag THIRD year ka. Yung masungit mong prof nung first year ngayon pinapansin ka. They do this because they see you already as family and they want you to succeed.

Profesors have a silver rule and nakikita nila na yung iba hindi fit sa program nila they expect na onti na lang ggraduate kasi sa students mismo yung problema

So if you are a first year student and you see your upperclassmen mingling with professors it is because they are nurturing them. Knowing na ggraduate na sila, its kinda nice that there is a family bond within the circle so its fine

May mga prof na masakit magsalita when i was a first year. I am already here in Canada pursuing my course studies and career

Here are the words na hindi ko makakalimutan:

1.	⁠Sayang gastos ng magulang niyo kung palpak kayo sa program na to. This is first year what more to the other units next year?

2.	⁠I'm telling you to drop now. We are professors and we are not merely teaching. If undecided ka nababastos mo kami. If napilitan ka dito nababastos mo kami. You are getting your diploma and job after this. Anong malabo dun?

3.	⁠We are molding you to graduate and pass board exam because that point its up to your hands. Yung board exam Niyo IS A SUMMARY OF YOUR FOUR YEARS SPENT HERE IN THIS UNIVERSITY! Your board EXAM has 200 Questions multiple choice.

EVERY FUCKING WRONG ANSWER in that 200 Questions it means palpak kami. Example Question Number 32. Subject niyo to nung second year na tinuro ni madam Chay. Number 44 is a subject you taken in your first year na tinuro ko. And we are not intentionally failing you since we are here in this campus all day sacrificing.

I’m on Day 6 after my LEEP procedure for CIN3. I had mine done in the hospital under anesthesia, and while the physical recovery started off manageable (just cramps and being really tired), now I’m dealing with something that’s affecting me on a deeper level…

The discharge. The SMELL. The black coffee ground type. The watery days that don’t feel (or smell) good. And honestly? It’s messing with me emotionally.

As a woman who really values hygiene and smelling good it’s been hard. It makes me feel not like myself, and it’s something I didn’t expect to feel this emotional about. I haven’t even been wanting my kids to hug me too long because I’m like what if they notice it? 

I know this is temporary. I know this is part of the healing. But I just wanted to say if you’re dealing with this too? You’re not alone. You’re not “gross.” You’re not doing anything wrong. Your body is doing what it needs to do to protect you, to heal you, and to prevent something way worse.
This is something I just had to remind myself of too. 
This part just…sucks. And I wish more people talked about it.

So today I’m giving myself grace doing what’s most important for my business etc but…I’m not rushing to feel better. I’m just letting myself be a woman who’s healing. 

How long did this phase last for you?
Did anything help you feel more “yourself” again?

Thanks for reading. I’m glad I joined this group I feel less alone. ",5,1745439144.0,PreCervicalCancer,7,1.0,False

1k6939k,https://i.redd.it/jl4tc99g4nwe1.jpeg,An interesting story of Peltier shenanigans and coolants freezing.,"Short version: So, my 12 TEC2-25408 (that cools coolant going to my CPU, a 9800x3d on direct die) got so cold to point it started freezing my coolant (about 50/50 wiper fluid and water) and made me think my pump died (when it was due to blockage)



Long version:  
So, I've been working on a little stupid project where i use TECs (aka, peltier device) to cool my CPU by putting them on a heat exchanger. they cool the coolant going into CPU (think watercooling) and waste heat gets pulled to the radiator. Ive made... 4 versions at this point:

V1: 8 TEC1-12706 (Does its job, used around \~100W to get my 9800x3d 10-15c below ambient on direct die, \~10c below ambient with IHS)

V2: 12 TEC1-12706 (Slightly better performance than V1, makes load temp more stable, but not much difference in idle)

V3: 10 TEC1-16108 + 12 TEC1-12610 (Essentially making it two-stage but with thermal barrier inbetween peltiers) - This one made CPU core temp went down all the way to 0c. (and I can't read temp value past 0c; hardware limitation or whatever) Full load temp of cpu was around \~70c on the core at 160W.

V4 (current): 12 TEC2-25408. (This is a proper two-stage module since im not thermal gluing two peltiers back to back). After started turning on, I noticed my CPU temp spiking after some time (maybe \~5 minutes) while it hits 0c.

I blamed on my little diaphragm coffee pot pump (yes really, its the only pump i was able to find that is small enough that has diaphragm for pressure) first; I was running them at 16-18 Volts for experiments to see if I get better temp with higher flow rate (Spoiler: it did not, apparently flow saturation is a thing).

So, naturally, I replaced this pump with another one: same thing.

As of right now, im running my system at low power mode (peltiers getting around 200W, core sits consistently at 5\~10C, instead of dropping to 0c). I don't have the thermal spiking effect.

It looks like I've made some truly horrific cooling setup.",5,1745439123.0,diyelectronics,1,1.0,False
