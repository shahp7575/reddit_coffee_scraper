Like, just little 3D Korvax/Gek/Vykeen faces to put on my fridge. And maybe a  alpha vector ship, a radiant pillar, an Atlas orb, the weird yellow animal face, a sentinel drone, a vortex cube, Chef Gek with Hand of Approval, etc.

And a Lego set or three. A trade outpost. One of those one-room bases with a landing pad and a merchant. An autophage encampment. 

A scale model set of any number of ships, various sentinel units, and a Venator and/or Dreadnaught freighter. Hell, I'd settle for a retro blacklight felt poster of some of these. It would fit the decades' vibe.

The list goes on and on and on, but all that's out there are quick print sites that will put a logo on a shirt or coffee mug, woo, yay. I can't justify a whole 3D printer setup for just for this one craving. And I'm still waiting for HG to give me a Squishimals Blob.

This will be our first time visiting.  We'll be there for 3.5 days, staying in the Old City area, not renting a car (planning to use public transportation and walk if it's not frigid).¬† Aunt & Uncle may drive up from DE to hang with us for a day - hopefully!  

I would love to get some locals' recommendations on what to see/do/eat/drink/avoid, so please weigh in with your 'can't miss' spots.  


We like museums, history, art, exploring cities on foot, coffee shops/roasters/tea shops, breweries/chill bars, local restaurants (fav cuisines are Vietnamese, Thai, Italian, Mexican, and sandwiches - upscale or hole-in-the-wall type places).    
  
Not big shoppers but we do like to support local businesses if there are any specific boutiques/shops that you recommend.  We'll want to bring a few goodies home for our husbands/her kiddos.  Not into clubbing/nightlife but we do love cocktails, wine, and beer.  

A few things I have bookmarked so far - probably far too many things to see/do in 3.5 days, so any input you have would be very appreciated, whether you'd see or skip:

See/Do: Rodin Museum, National Constitution Center, Museum of Art, Independence Hall, Eastern State Penitentiary, Liberty Bell, JFK Plaza/Love Park

Eat/Drink: Jim's South St., Cleaver's, Angelos, Schlesinger's (breakfast), Nan Zhou hand pulled noodles, Reading Terminal Market (food and local stuff), Old City Coffee",4,1736877579.0,philly,3,1.0,False

1i1c16p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i1c16p/aio_ended_a_situationship/,AIO ended a situationship ,"I (37f) ended a situationship with a guy (40m) I met on Tinder in September. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm emotional so I apologize in advance if this post seems like a wall of nonsensical text.

When we first met, we went on a date and continued to see where it goes, we had a really good connection and I was having fun and enjoyed his company so I was fine with that. We were hanging out once or twice a week for a month and texting each other throughout the day when we could. I was developing a crush on him but I didn't want to say anything because he told me in passing he wasn't looking for anything serious (I was aware it was going into situationship territory and was good with it) and I didn't want to push it out of respect for his wishes. 

One day he asked me if I would be offended if he hooked up with a guy. I was taken aback by it and I was really silent. he asked me why I was silent, I was honest and reluctantly told him I liked him. We discussed our relationship being casual and I told him just not to tell me details about his hooking up with other people. I never brought up liking him again or anything to do with progressing our relationship.

He ended the ""seeing where it goes"" a month later because he said he wanted to take a step back from dating, felt like it was getting too ""relationshippey"", told me it seemed like we weren't on the same page, and told me I was texting him too much throughout the day (I'd send 5 at most like usual). I send my friends memes and random funny things throughout the day, including him at that point. I felt treated unfairly because in my mind, I was treating him as I'd treat another friend. It felt like because he brought it up, he was making it relationshippey, not me. I didn't want anything more than what we were doing.

Then the next day he asked me to go for coffee. We hooked up again then agreed to a casual relationship. We didn't talk as often as before, just hooked up sometimes, but ""relationship possibilities"", as he put it, were definitely there. He'd have chances to hook up, and I repeatedly told him he didn't have to tell me about him hooking up with other people, as we're casual so he's not obligated to share that stuff with me. He told me he wanted to be honest about them. Myself, I'm a private person and I'm unaccustomed to telling people about my hookups so from my perspective, it just seems like a weird thing to do with someone you're hooking up with on a casual basis. 

On Saturday night he told me he needed to tell me something. I'm like okay shoot. He told me he was waiting on a hookup. I told him thanks for telling me. Later that night, he told me he was invited over the next night and he acted really giddy and nervous about it. 

At this point I was angry. I was a little bit offended that he told me he was too busy to hang out but ended up going with someone else. More so than that, I felt disrespected that he'd let me on his feeling excited and nervous to hook up with another person. I felt rejected and insecure. I'm not proud to admit that but yeah. I can understand being honest and not lying if it was asked....but voluntarily giving away the details or boasting about it feels out-of- left field at best and insensitive at worst for me. 

I told him his things would be in his mailbox and said something nasty to him out of anger and the feeling of being done with it. I'm starting to feel like I overreacted. It just feels like three months of what was supposed to be fun turned into an emotional minefield for no reason.

Ange Postecoglou held his press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of Tottenham's trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.

The latest north London derby comes at a time with both teams battling with injuries and having gone to extra-time in their FA Cup ties on Sunday. Spurs needed extra-time to beat non-league Tamworth 3-0 on their artificial 3G pitch while Arsenal could not find a way past 10-man Manchester United in normal or extra-time and ended up exiting the competition following a penalty shoot-out with Ruben Amorim's men.

Postecoglou provided an update on Richarlison's fitness, a new injury in the camp, spoke about the latest transfer news in and out of the club as well as some abuse he received at Tamworth and the head coach covered plenty of other topics around the team and the game.

Our Spurs correspondent Alasdair Gold was among those putting the questions to Postecoglou. We've got a full transcript with every single word the Australian said in his press conference at Hotspur Way ahead of the big derby.

**What's the latest team news and how did the artificial pitch affect the players afterwards?**

>Not too bad. It takes a fair bit out of the players so we have done some extra recovery and we won‚Äôt train until this afternoon to give the boys a chance to recover because the pitch takes a bit out of you. The only one who picked up an injury is Timo. He picked up a hamstring injury and we are waiting on the results of that scan. Everyone else, apart from being sore, pulled through okay. In terms of incoming, Richarlison is available.

**Both teams have injuries, is there no good or bad time to play this game?**

>Well you have got no choice, that's the fixture. You‚Äôve got to accept it. We have been in this situation for quite a while now and obviously hopefully there will be some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of players coming back and like I said Richy. It was good for Mikey to get an hour on the weekend or whenever it was. I have lost track of days.

>The situation is what it is but a big game tomorrow night. Big game for the club, big game for our season, big game for our supporters so I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

**Are you further down the line with any new signings?**

>It‚Äôs hard to say. Like most other clubs, January is a difficult one to really have any certainty about anything. There are a lot of things which need to come together. I think I said last week the club is working really hard in that area and if there are any developments we will let everyone know.

**Because of the bad injury situation will no players be leaving as Napoli are reportedly interested in Werner?**

>Yeah, we can‚Äôt afford to let anyone go at the moment. Some of the young players, Alfie Dorrington went out on loan and we will probably do similar for young Will (Lankshear) because he hasn‚Äôt really played a lot. Aside from that, we are looking at incomings if anything happens.

**I saw you got a late Christmas present from Tamworth?**

>They got me a nice coffee mug with my face and Andy‚Äôs face on it. A couple of handsome blokes. I can look at that and remember that game fondly. Thank you. Good people.

**Has the north London derby intensified since you've been here?**

>I felt it was intense from the moment I arrived but at the same time I've never tried to be disingenuous about this stuff and say 'this means the world to me' when I've literally just arrived. But you get the context of the game and what it means to the club and supporters and what it means for our season. From that perspective, right from the first time we played them, I was well aware. It's like being up in Glasgow, you're well aware of know what it means and the ramifications of both the positive and negative. I've been on it for the first game. This year is as big as they ever come, especially for us and our season. We have to start winning games in the League and no better place to start.

**Could a win be a turning point tomorrow?**

>I don't like framing games in terms of turning points because then you've got to go up to Everton and face David [Moyes] at the weekend. So there's no easy games. But in the position we're in in the league, irrespective of turning points we need to start winning games and moving up the table. While this is a massive challenge tomorrow night, it's an opportunity for us to do that.

**Antonin Kinsky is the first Tottenham goalkeeper in 100 years to keep two clean sheets in his first first games. How involved are you with him?**

>I'm involved as everyone else. They've all been big games for him for different reasons. Obviously the Liverpool game goes without saying but it was a hell of a challenge for him up at Tamworth, too, especially with the way they play and their ability to put pressure on goalkeepers. I thought he handled it so well and helped us nullify a big threat from them. He's handled everything really well. I haven't spent any extra time with him. Birchy [Rob Burch, GK coach] obviously has and part of the process -- because it has been a bit of a whirlwind -- is making sure he's settled, especially off the field. He's moving to a different country so to manage everything around him is equally important. So far he's been really good at embracing the challenge we've thrown at him and I'm sure he's looking forward to tomorrow as well.

**Lucas Bergvall's former coaches in Sweden said he would take six months to adapt to the Premier League, is he there now and in a position where he can start in every game?**

>Yeah, look, he's definitely growing, which is not unusual. He's 18, coming from a different country and league. It was always going to take him time to adapt, just to training more than anything else. But we've seen in recent weeks he's really making an impact now and I think he feels more comfortable and confident in himself. There's so much more to come from him with his age and where he is experience-wise. It's been a big year for him, moving to a new country and a big league and a big club. Even playing for the senior national team with Sweden as an 18-year-old. All these things are pretty significant moments and you look at how young people handle them and he's handled it all really, really well. He's kept his head down, kept working, waited for his opportunity and he's doing well.

**With him and Archie Gray, what is it about them as 18-year-olds that helps them handle the big stage?**

>Well, it is just upbringing and the kind of people they are. It‚Äôs a bit of DNA, nurturing, environment and everything. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve tried to do with the players we‚Äôve brought in. Those two and Mikey is only 17 and guys like Kinsky, Destiny, Pape and Micky van de Ven, who we‚Äôve come across as young players, whatever challenge we‚Äôve thrown at them respective of where they are right now ‚Äì they‚Äôve handled it well for being a young person in significant moments.

**As a player who likes fiery games, how important is it to have Richarlison back for north London derby?**

>Just got to get him back, he has had obviously an unfortunate season for us. Last season he played, even this season when he played for us and did his hamstring (while providing an assist), it‚Äôs not just his fighting and scrapping, he has quality as well. Just having an extra attacking player ‚Äì with him and Mikey available now ‚Äì makes such a difference in what we can do during games, between games, in terms of the way we play. We have taken our time with him this time for sure. He has kind of been harassing me for the last 10 days to be involved but we have been disciplined with that and he has looked really good in training. He looks ready to go so really happy to get him back involved.

**Arsenal have injuries, do you sympathy for Arteta?**

>I don‚Äôt know how much sympathy they‚Äôve all had for me ‚Äì I am not sure‚Ä¶ Certainly I have empathy which is probably a better word. I understand how challenging it is for any team, irrespective of the size or quality. With all these things, it is where the injuries hit, the areas they hit and the significance of the injuries all make it challenging but I am sure Mikel is not going to let that get in the way of him putting out a team tomorrow night that can beat us.

**Arsenal have been having injuries in attack and yours have mainly been in defence, and they've had criticism for not scoring goals, can you look at that with some shared experience and why do you think teams are losing players in these positions?**

>I always put context around how you analyse and critique performances, others choose not to and they purely go on outputs. If you look at a team and they lose and don‚Äôt score goals, it‚Äôs poor play or poor players or poor coaching or whatever. I think in the context of cohesion and fluidity, if you‚Äôve got injuries and disruptions, that does affect what you do.

>We‚Äôve obviously been hit really hard, but they're starting to accumulate for most clubs. I'll be very surprised if any club goes through unscathed the way the season is going so far. You know, Bournemouth have had a couple now, Brighton, there's a few clubs who are now starting to rack up a few, a few of those. Obviously us with our fixture schedule, we've probably been hit harder than most, but I'd be surprised if any club comes through unscathed this season.

**Was there a cynical side of you that was maybe a bit happy that Arsenal played 120 minutes against Man United ahead of this game because you also had to do the same?**

>I'm not a cynical kind of person, mate. I just enjoyed the game, I enjoyed the theatre, I thought it was a cracking game, cracking cup game, and two sides going at it, and yeah, I enjoyed it.

**The rivalry with Arsenal became quite a big theme when you played Manchester City in May. some of the Spurs fans wanted their team to lose or were content for their team to lose, what did you learn about the North London rivalry from that experience?**

>Nothing I didn't already know. I said at the time, I totally understand it, I don't agree with it, I would never go into a game wanting to lose, that was the basic principle. It didn't mean I don't understand the rivalry between the teams. Trust me, when I was up at Celtic, there was only one other result they looked at, and if their weekend was going to be perfect, then it meant an 'L' for the other team and a 'W' for us. That was a perfect weekend, not just a 'W' for us, so I understand that, but it still doesn't mean I'll go in any game wanting to lose. I don't care what the fallout is from it.

**You said after that game that you felt the foundations here were really fragile, the 48 hours that experience had taught you that, could you just elaborate on what you meant by that?**

>Mate, you're going back a bit seriously, and you're plucking out a probably a quote out of context, but there's been a hell of a lot that's happened since then and right now we're in a different place. We're kind of dealing with different things. I still believe that there's been growth in the team, but that hasn't been matched by results and consistency of results in the league.

>So we need to rectify that, that's got to be our main priority right now and, notwithstanding that, I think we've seen some growth and hopefully with some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of players coming back, hopefully that means we can look at this back half of the season as something where we can make an impact.

**I presume you feel the foundations are firmer now?**

>Look, again mate you are asking me to comment on a quote that I can‚Äôt remember the context, but if you want to frame it in that way, then yeah (foundations are firmer).

**Mikey Moore‚Äôs illness came at an unfortunate time as he would have got minutes over last two months, how ready is he to make an impact despite being 17?**

>Yeah, look he has worked hard at training and you could see at the weekend he needed some game-time. He started off pretty slowly but by the second half I thought he grew into the game. We used him significantly in the first half of the year and he made a real impact, particularly in Europe I thought he did really well and we expect him to (again). That‚Äôs why we kept him with us and why he is part of the first-team set-up. It‚Äôs good to get him back because he is a player we know can make an impact in games.

**You took some stick at Tamworth and took it in very good spirit. You'd imagine more pelters coming your way tomorrow night or will that not compare to Tamworth?**

>As I said after the game, credit to Andy (Peaks) and his players and the people of Tamworth at the football club. I thought they did themselves proud on the day with the way they presented everything. 90 per cent of the crowd were very good and enjoyed the banter. There was 10 per cent who were pretty unacceptable. The stuff I heard was pretty vile and detestable, and getting things thrown at me, not a great experience, mate but we‚Äôre kind of expected to be the bigger person. I would have loved to have turned around and not be the bigger person in that moment, but you deal with it and go on.

**At start of this season there was talk about lack of win away to top-six club, but you've done that at the Manchester clubs and beat City, United and Liverpool in the cup, how much would you love for a win at Arsenal to be the next thing this group of players can tick off?**

>Yeah, look all of these things are challenges we need to overcome. Everything to one side, you know it‚Äôs a derby and a big game so irrespective of what‚Äôs gone on beforehand and even if we were flying in top position, it wouldn‚Äôt change the significance of this game. You understand it is a standalone fixture in that it means a hell of a lot to our supporters and to our club. So, that‚Äôs the focus and that is what we‚Äôve got to hone in on in terms of us wanting to really bring our best performance of the day so we can make our supporters happy and also in the context of our season, it‚Äôs just really important we start winning games in the league.

>That is where the emphasis lies. I don‚Äôt think things like turning points or significant moments, I don‚Äôt see in that prism of where we‚Äôre at, we‚Äôve had some pretty significant wins and yet we haven‚Äôt kicked on from them this year. If we do get the job done tomorrow night, we‚Äôve still got to make sure our focus then is on another challenging game at the weekend.",7,1736877244.0,coys,1,0.89,False

I can‚Äôt pretend to do something which I do not like , hence I don‚Äôt have a big group of people I can talk to. 

Hmu if you wanna talk about anything, anytime over coffee/ Brunch. 
Let‚Äôs try to be with similar individuals out there who are existing in this crowded city but yet lonely.

I go for Breakfast Rides , Morning Treks, long rides rarely. And I just enjoy exploring new food places around the town. I equally appreciate both veg / non-veg food. If you are someone who would enjoy doing the same , we should definitely hangout.",0,1736877183.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,0.5,False

I run a small but mighty caf√© and every time we get a visit from the health department, she changes her stance on how we are keeping it, and I try and adjust it EVERY time to be compliant. 

In the past, at other restaurants, we made it either to order (KILL ME) or had a fresh mix in a Baine Marie. Never had a problem.

Now here, before I was a manager, we originally had a recipe using pasteurized yolk and butter, mixing with immersion blender. We literally kept the bottles in warm places and were told that as long as we use pasteurized eggs and didn't have it out longer than 4 hours, it was fine.

ENTER NEW HEALTH INSPECTOR----

\-First thing she said was we couldn't keep it on the counter like that. Regardless of time or temperature...?

\-After that, I tried a coffee thermos, tossed after 4 hours. She didn't like that either.

\-We would then bottle it and keep it in a bottle warmer. Temped at 135 -She told me this wasn't okay??

\-I finally switched to the powder which she recommended (...I know, ew) because it didn't need time or temp control, which seemed to be fine for her 2 visits in a row

\-Now she has told me it does need time and temp control because it has milk powder in it... luckily we do keep it at a high temp anyways, but if I need to do that anyways, I want to go back to the pasteurized yolk version...

  
Can anyone help tell me your process?

Tips?

Any similar problems you've had with the health department?

1i1bqu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1bqu3/broken_mirror/,Broken Mirror,"**I**t started with small things, as these realizations often do. Not dramatic, not obvious‚Äîjust small shifts that you‚Äôd dismiss if you weren‚Äôt paying attention. The clock on the wall at work seemed faster than usual, ticking along with a smug urgency. My phone rang, but no one was there, just silence that stretched long enough to make me hang up. 

Nothing worth mentioning, right? That‚Äôs what I told myself. But then it became harder to shake.

Last Tuesday, I walked into my usual bakery. The bell above the door gave its familiar chime, and the air smelled of sourdough and burnt coffee. Normal. Comfortable. I ordered my usual: a black coffee, no sugar, and a croissant. But the cashier‚Äîsomeone I‚Äôd seen dozens of times‚Äîlooked at me with a blank stare when I asked.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell croissants,‚Äù she said.

I laughed, thinking it was a joke. ‚ÄúSince when?‚Äù

She blinked, her face neutral, and shrugged. ‚ÄúWe never have.‚Äù

The strangest part wasn‚Äôt her response‚Äîit was that the other customers seemed unfazed. Like they hadn‚Äôt heard anything unusual. I glanced at the menu on the wall, searching for evidence, and sure enough: no croissants. I left without my coffee.

By Thursday, the strangeness had begun to snowball. I passed my neighbor in the hallway, an older man who always wore the same scuffed brown shoes. I‚Äôd see him almost daily. We‚Äôd nod in acknowledgment but never talk. That day, though, he wore sneakers‚Äîbrand-new ones, bright white, laced too tightly.

‚ÄúNew shoes?‚Äù I asked, surprised I‚Äôd even spoken.

He stopped, looked down at his feet, and frowned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had these,‚Äù he said, as if correcting a child. I didn‚Äôt reply. I didn‚Äôt know how to. That night, I scrolled through photos on my phone, trying to ground myself. They felt off, though I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why. A picture from a trip I took last year‚Äîonly, I didn‚Äôt remember being there. Another of me with friends at a birthday party I swear I didn‚Äôt attend. Every photo was like that: familiar, yet not mine. By Sunday, I avoided people entirely. Conversations felt like walking into a room and forgetting why you came. A friend called to check on me‚Äîsomething about missing dinner plans I didn‚Äôt remember making. I apologized, my voice strained, but she brushed it off too easily, like she wasn‚Äôt listening at all. I stayed home after that. The news became unbearable. Headlines blurred into nonsense, shifting in meaning every time I blinked. A story about rising fuel prices would become a report on invasive species by the time I refreshed the page. Even the weather‚Äîsimple, predictable‚Äîfelt wrong. The rain fell noiselessly, like a movie with the sound muted.

Last night, it all came to a head. I opened my journal, hoping to write everything down. I needed clarity, proof that I wasn‚Äôt unraveling. But when I flipped through the pages, the handwriting wasn‚Äôt mine. The words on the earlier entries‚Äîthings I‚Äôd written weeks, even months ago‚Äîwere unfamiliar, almost cryptic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs slipping,‚Äù one line read. Another said, ‚ÄúLook closer.‚Äù

I stared at those two words:¬†*Look closer.*

At what?



**T**oday, it hit me.

The moment of realization wasn‚Äôt grand or cinematic. It was quiet, like a final puzzle piece clicking into place. I was pouring cereal when I noticed the box wasn‚Äôt the same brand I‚Äôd been buying for years. The milk smelled like oranges. And then, as if my mind had been waiting for this exact detail to unlock, everything shifted. The kitchen light felt colder, harsher. The floor seemed closer than it should be. My hands, steady moments before, trembled as I gripped the counter.

This isn‚Äôt real.

Not the cereal, not the milk. Not my kitchen. Not me.

You think this is a story, don‚Äôt you? Some cleverly crafted little anecdote to pass the time. But that‚Äôs the problem.¬†*You‚Äôre reading this,*¬†and that means you‚Äôre part of it, too.

Maybe you‚Äôve noticed it‚Äîhow the days feel shorter, the moments thinner. The gaps in your memory, the ones you blame on being tired or busy. Look around. Look closer. Do the faces you see every day seem‚Ä¶ complete? Does your life fit together in a way that feels solid, or is it just convincing enough to keep you from asking questions?

1i1bpln,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1i1bpln/my_experience_after_a_week_cold_turkey/,My experience after a week cold turkey,"On January 5th, I spontaneously decided to quit cold turkey. On the 12th, I picked the pouches back up. I wanted to see just how fast the way I was feeling could change. Now, I‚Äôd like to share my experience in the hopes that someone else will benefit from reading it. 

For some background, I bought my first can of Copenhagen Wintergreen on my 18th birthday. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but that was one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made. Over the next 10 years, I was always addicted to some form of nicotine. I vaped for several years then switched to zyns when my state passed a vape ban in 2023 that left me without access to my favorite flavors and brands of vapes. It wasn‚Äôt until I quit that I realized just how much nicotine was affecting me. 

The first day was pretty rough. I have a post on my profile that goes into more detail if you care to read it. I had a perpetual state of brain fog but was otherwise doing okay with the help of some coffee pouches and staying busy at work. I ended up having my supper and going to bed pretty early just to get the day over with faster. Days 2 and 3 were much better. This was when I really started to feel the difference. 

The first thing I noticed was how much more energetic I felt. I‚Äôm sure the coffee pouches contributed to this, but I know how caffeine affects me even in larger amounts and there was definitely more to it. I wasn‚Äôt fighting to stay awake at my desk all morning, which is how it was for years even when I had energy drinks and coffee. I was waking up and getting out of bed much easier than before. I felt almost like I was a teenager again, before I ever started down this road that led me here. 

The next thing I noticed was my appetite. I used to go all day without really feeling hungry until the evening when I had supper. Without nicotine, I was feeling hungry by 10AM if I skipped breakfast as I often do. If I didn‚Äôt have something more substantial than instant noodles for lunch, I‚Äôd be hungry again by 3PM. I stocked up on some protein bars, nuts, and other healthier snacks so I didn‚Äôt tear through junk food like chips or candy. Just like with my energy level, my appetite felt like I was a teenager again who could never get enough to eat. I made sure to keep my meals as healthy as possible since I was eating more than normal. 

This part is more psychological but I feel it‚Äôs worth mentioning. My overall mood, after the initial irritability of the first day, improved drastically. Along with being energetic, I was feeling more happy and confident than I‚Äôd felt in years. Things that used to annoy me suddenly didn‚Äôt matter so much. I felt comfortable in my own skin. 

When I picked the pouches back up again, I didn‚Äôt really feel much from the first one or two. By yesterday afternoon, I could tell I was starting to get back my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feeling from before I quit. I still feel this way now and while I wouldn‚Äôt say I feel bad, it‚Äôs nothing like how I was feeling last week. I definitely don‚Äôt want to stay like this anymore. 

Overall, I was shocked at how quickly the way I was feeling could change. I know that initial ‚Äúrush‚Äù last week from quitting would eventually fade as well, and it even started to by the end of the week. However, I know I‚Äôd rather feel normal off nicotine than go back to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I had while on it. I know that everyone experiences quitting differently and I had a much easier time with it than I thought I would. If you‚Äôre having a harder time with the cravings and withdrawals, please don‚Äôt get discouraged. It will get better with time, I promise you that. If you‚Äôre considering quitting, take this as a sign to go for it. You have nothing to lose other than an (expensive) addiction and so much to gain. 

I thank you for your time in reading this post. I know it‚Äôs a long one. I hope you‚Äôre able to gain some benefit from learning about my experience. I‚Äôm sure with time, I‚Äôll be able to look back on this and have even more insight. I‚Äôm grateful for this community of people that have come together to help each other through this challenging journey.

He had planned a very long date (escape room, dinner, movie, coffee/hanging out in his car). It lasted 9 hours and went pretty well, we had good conversations and this time I kissed him when he asked me to, we actually ended up making out pretty heavily (lots of heavy petting). During the date, he seemed really interested in me, he went out of his way to take care of me, he told me he liked me (idk about that... when a man says that to me on the first couple of dates, it sounds like a defensive alarm in my head) and he talked in the future tense (for example, when you come back from your work trip, we should do this...). All good things in theory, the problem is, I can't tell if his intentions are sincere, and I think he may be attempting to love bomb me. Also, I'm not impressed with his level of communication post-date, I feel like he was more proactive with his texting before our second date. Am I right to be guarded?

I live in a location with moderately hard water (varies throughout the year, dependent upon the source the city is using).

Intuitively speaking, my thoughts are to run from the mainline directly to hosebibs and yard sprinklers, then also feed the mainline to a whole house filter.  From there, there would be a branch to a water softener that would proceed to a bathrooms/kitchen/laundry room, and another branch that would go through additional filtration before heading to consumable sources (water faucet at main sink and coffee bar sink, as well as the two ice makers).

I imagine flow is a consideration for most of the house, but less so for drinking/ice makers).

For context, I'm a furry and I frequently attend meets, and so while I talked with this guy a few times, I somehow never saw his face, but we did text a lot after.

He had to move away for a job and though we've been texting I didn't think much of it but he had to come back for a wedding so we decided to meet up for coffee and catch up. Turns out, he was really cute and we vibed together really well, and spent hours hanging out and even got dinner together. He has a lot of the same interests as me and really interesting insights on deep topics and was super fun to talk to.

I'm not gonna pretend anything will come of it, after all he lives in another state now and won't be back for at least half the year, but it's still been kind of fun thinking about it. I've been in a major depressive episode and while it's definitely not the main motivator it's extra motivation to go to the gym, eat well, meditate, and get up in the morning.

Even if nothing ever comes of it, I'm glad I have him in my life.",1,1736876026.0,self,0,0.57,False

1i1bgr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i1bgr2/sibo_and_toxic_bile/,SIBO and Toxic Bile,"I have had SIBO for years and my root cause is gluten intolerance. I developed a lot of symptoms that got worse until I eliminated gluten, but many of them remained and did not get better until I started treating the SIBO. For about 1.5 years, I have had lots of improvements with high doses of vitamin C and coffee. In the short term, these treatments caused die off reactions and exacerbated my symptoms, but in the long run my symptoms have gradually been fading. I didn't initially realize the importance of the liver and gallbladder in all this, but in what follows I will try to summarize my current understanding. 

Poor motility causes food to stay in the small intestine for too long a period, which allows bacteria to overgrow from the large intestine into the small intestine. This results in increased levels of lipopolysaccharides and perhaps other toxins that can escape the gut into the bloodstream. This activates the immune system, resulting in MCAS, histamine intolerance, food intolerances, psoriasis, etc. A lot of these toxins end up in the liver, which tries to get rid of them by excreting them via bile into the gallbladder and subsequently into stool. But when SIBO has advanced, the increased load of toxins changes the consistency of the bile, making it more viscous and sludgy. This compounds the problem because bile is supposed to act as a detergent and kill off bacteria in the small intestine. Furthermore, the bile that does make it to the small intestine is deconjugated by the SIBO, which makes it less effective. 

Therefore, it doesn't make sense to discuss SIBO in isolation from the liver and gallbladder. If you have SIBO, your liver and gallbladder will be negatively impacted in such a way as to exacerbate SIBO. It's a vicious cycle. My experience with vitamin C and coffee confirm this. Vitamin C increases bile flow because it is needed to convert cholesterol to bile acids. Coffee (even decaf) increases bile flow. Exercise and eating generally (fatty foods specifically) do the same. Consuming vitamin C and coffee in varying amounts over time caused die off reactions that worsened until I broke up the biofilms. Since then, I continue to have ""die off"" symptoms, though perhaps it would make more sense to refer to them as detox symptoms. 

I know that I'm getting better because my psoriasis, brain fog and low libido are all improving, but it is a little discouraging how long it is taking. All I can assume is that the result of having gluten intolerance and SIBO for so many years is that my liver and gallbladder have accumulated a substantial load of toxins. Full healing can only occur when these have worked themselves out of my body and bile flow is normalized. To me, it seems more logical to attribute at least part of my remaining detox symptoms to the contents of the bile itself and not merely to bacteria that are being killed off. 

If anyone has any insights into this or has similar experiences to share, I'd love to hear it. I wish there was a way to speed up the healing process, but perhaps the natural reduction in bile flow is the body's defense mechanism to protect it from dealing with too much toxicity at one time.

1i1bghe,https://www.reddit.com/r/boykisser/comments/1i1bghe/fox_and_bear_love_story/,Fox and Bear Love Story,"In the bustling city of Evergreen Heights, where skyscrapers cast long shadows over the parks, lived a vibrant fox named Kira. Though he was often surrounded by friends and colorful nightlife, Kira felt a deep sense of loneliness in his heart. He longed for companionship, dreaming of a boyfriend who was tall, strong, and who would understand his whims and tender heart. 



One chilly evening, while Kira sat on a park bench drawing in his sketchbook, he noticed a warm presence beside him. It was Connor, a tall, chubby bear clad in a cozy sweater, engrossed in his laptop. Connor worked in IT, often wrapped in his world of codes and screens. But he seemed different that evening; his eyes sparkled with warmth beneath his glasses as he looked up from his work. With an easy smile, he introduced himself, and Kira instantly felt a connection.



As days turned into weeks, Kira and Connor formed a bond that blossomed into a deep friendship. They spent evenings laughing over coffee in cozy cafes, exchanging stories and experiencing the city's charm together. Connor‚Äôs calm demeanor offered Kira comfort, while Kira‚Äôs sunny personality brought a spark of life into Connor‚Äôs routine. With shared interests in art and technology, they celebrated their unique traits, often venturing out to attend cultural events or quiet movie nights. 



However, things took an unexpected turn when Kira‚Äôs old high school nemesis, a sly and manipulative wolf named Jake, entered the picture. Eager to rekindle their rivalry, Jake began spreading rumors about Kira‚Äôs art, claiming it lacked originality. The whispers reached Connor, causing him to question the validity of their friendship. Feeling hurt, Kira withdrew, drowning in sadness as he absorbed the negativity surrounding him. 



Realizing the toll that the rumors were taking on Kira, Connor confronts Jake one evening at a bar where the trio happened to be present. The confrontation spiraled quickly‚ÄîConnor stood his ground, defending Kira fiercely. ‚ÄúYou think you can tear him apart with lies? You don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be truly vulnerable,‚Äù Connor roared. The tension climaxed in a heated exchange that drew the attention of patrons, ultimately leading Jake to slink away in embarrassment.



In the aftermath, Kira found solace in Connor, who sat with him on the same park bench where they first met. Connor reassured him, ‚ÄúYou hold such amazing talent, and anyone who says otherwise isn‚Äôt worth your time.‚Äù Overwhelmed with gratitude, Kira felt a spark ignite between them, a gentle connection that hinted at something more. They spoke deeply about their dreams, fears, and the strength they found in each other. 



As weeks passed, Kira and Connor embraced their feelings, turning their friendship into a tender romance. Their love story blossomed amid supportive silence, shared laughter, and whispered secrets. Together, they realized that while life might throw challenges their way, their bond made them resilient. They navigated through trials, each supporting the other, and the power of their love helped Kira emerge stronger, teaching Connor the importance of vulnerability.



Eventually, under a starlit sky on Kira‚Äôs favorite park bench, with the night alive around them, Connor took Kira‚Äôs paw in his. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always dreamed of someone who sees me for who I am, and I see you,‚Äù he said softly. Kira's heart swelled, and tears brimmed in his eyes. ‚ÄúI never thought I would find love like this. You‚Äôve shown me the light in the darkness,‚Äù he replied.



‚ÄãTogether, Kira and Connor carved out a space in their hearts for one another, and their world turned splendidly colorful, underscoring the beauty of love that transcends loneliness and adversity.",0,1736875933.0,boykisser,0,0.5,False
1i1bfg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i1bfg2/network_is_everything/,Network is everything,"We all know that times are difficult. When I started in this career, passing an interview was as simple as taking a coffee and proving you knew what a pointer was (it's still the case of some industries, where the value is more on the engineering side than the software side). Heck, I even got one job offer at a place where they add no job offering, just because they liked me !

Right now the situation is dantesque, a lot of us are on the market, looking for opportunities, getting an interview is almost impossible, and when you have one you'll be expected to solve 3 hard LC problems in 15 min then to design YT or equivalent from scratch.

Here is my small advice, that I was given myself and neglected at the time: network is absolutely everything.

When you are in a position: be nice, go take the coffee with your colleagues, talk, ask them about their passions, **be sincere**. No small talk, no faked interest, no fake politics, be genuine and not only people will appreciate you but you will enjoy great, sincere relationships with others.  
A recruter reached out to you and you weren't interested or something happened ? Keep in touch. Someone was laid-off from your company ? Reach out to them regularly.

I've meet people who consistently refused to come have a coffee break with us, heck I even met one guy who didn't join us to eat the cake I baked FOR HIM when he left (I was doing that for every person leaving). I don't even remember his name now. I remember all the others, and they do remember me as well.

I'm still employed luckily, but I had a few interview recently, both were because of referrals. Once from a colleague I've never could actually meet, and once from a friend who referrals to their friend. I don't know what will happen, but both opportunities are in aeras where I have 0 experience and where I'd like to grow.

I understand the thing about being an introvert and that our colleagues aren't our friends (they still can be sometimes however). I'm an introvert myself, tbh most of us are introvert around me. We are still social.

This is important, more than you think, more than your hard-skills. Take care of your network.",0,1736875857.0,cscareerquestions,1,0.5,False

[Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxq41o/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

The past few days I‚Äôve moved through life like a zombie. I finished a handful of easy jobs well aware of what other Contract Workers whispered to each other when they assumed I wasn‚Äôt looking. August and April were busy with other tasks so I had no one willing to work with me. ¬†

At least the jobs were mostly harmless. Dr. Fillow rewrapped my bad leg warning how it should be replaced soon. He poked around asking about my personal life. I gave him one-word answers feeling far too exhausted to get into details. ¬†

Out of the blue, August called asking if I could go over to his place. He said he wanted to go on a short trip with me and that I should wear warm clothing. I should have refused so he wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with my bad mood. He threatened to drag me out of my bed if I didn‚Äôt come over. Since I didn‚Äôt have much of a choice, I got dressed, feeling slightly light-headed. ¬†

He took one look at me and decided to make breakfast. I had been showering so I didn‚Äôt think I looked as bad as I felt. He forced me to sit at the kitchen table while he fried some eggs. August learned how to make some very simple dishes. He set the plate in front of me and then got started putting together some lunch. I could only have a few bites of eggs with toast before my stomach started to hurt. I rested my head on the table wanting to just roll over and die. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten you so moody?‚Äù August finally asked. ¬†

‚ÄúI got dumped.‚Äù I said realizing he was the first person I told. ¬†

He stopped working and wiped his hands on a tablecloth. He walked over behind my chair to lean down hugging my shoulders. ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sweetheart.‚Äù He said sounding like a father comforting a heartbroken teenage daughter. ¬†

I barely made an effort to shrug him away. I knew he wanted to make me feel better but it didn‚Äôt help. I felt him press his face against the side of my head making slurping sounds. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked too tired to push him away. ¬†

‚ÄúEating your brains.‚Äù He answered pausing in his efforts. ‚ÄúHmm, not much in here.‚Äù ¬†

I finally pushed him aside. He laughed at his own joke and then got a cup of coffee. He set it in front of me and got back to work on making lunches.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúIto is an Agent. He could die at any moment while working. He must have broken it off between you two before you got too attached.‚Äù August said as I nodded along, ¬†

I understood that. The facts didn‚Äôt stop me from being depressed. I knew in the long run it would be better for both of us. ¬†

‚ÄúDid you have a partner that passed away?‚Äù August commented over his shoulder. ¬†

My stomach tightened. I didn‚Äôt like talking about her or what happened. The fact I worked with someone else two years ago wasn‚Äôt hard information to find even though I rarely talked about it. ¬†

‚ÄúI heard you were injured but you took time off because of her death was hard on you. How would you react if something happened to Ito? You‚Äôre hurting now, but it was his choice to not cause more pain in the future.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware of that. It's just-‚Äù I started to speak and paused to take a sip of coffee. ¬†

No, it wasn‚Äôt coffee. I don‚Äôt know what it was. A taste I couldn‚Äôt describe hit me like a truck as I saw a swirl of strange colors. I coughed spitting out the foul liquid.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to make coffee.‚Äù August admitted with a smile that looked more like a grimace. ¬†

He reminded me of a dog that had been caught doing something it shouldn‚Äôt. He went to dump the mug but I told him to save it and give it to The Corporation as some sort of biological weapon.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúI realize it‚Äôll be painful to lose him. I think it would be worth it though.‚Äù I said after I recovered. ¬†

Whatever he put in that mug cleared my brain enough to collect my thoughts for the first time in a while. ¬†

‚ÄúYou might be strong enough but is Ito? Are you going to force him into something he‚Äôs not emotionally ready for?‚Äù He pointed out. ¬†

I leaned back in my chair feeling so stupid I didn‚Äôt consider that. With a long sigh, I scrubbed my face against my palms in frustration. August finished putting our lunches together and handed over a bag of food. He was ready to go and wanted to be done dealing with my personal life. ¬†

‚ÄúYou should send him a message clearly explaining your feelings that you can handle the pain of losing him in exchange for time together. However, you need to make it clear you‚Äôll accept the fact he may not be able to do the same. The worst thing you can do is pressure him into something he doesn‚Äôt want to make you happy. This might be Ito‚Äôs first relationship. So far, I think you two are doing just fine.‚Äù ¬†

It felt like a fog temporarily cleared from my mind. I‚Äôd been moping around for so long it kept me from actually thinking properly. ¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good dad.‚Äù I said to him. ¬†

We stopped by the door to get our jackets on. August paused as if I had said something wrong. ¬†

‚ÄúSpeaking of which, where is Lucas?‚Äù I asked looking for a pair of small shoes near the door. ¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs with his relatives today.‚Äù He refused to elaborate.¬† ¬†

I decided to not press the matter. I‚Äôd been too focused on my own issues I hadn‚Äôt been paying attention to his. He hadn‚Äôt told me much about what was going on with him and Lucas. As far as I knew, he still had him on the weekends and had been working hard on changing that. I suddenly felt like a bad friend. Sure, August would gladly eat me if I died but at least he was willing to wait. I should really start treating him better. ¬†

August created a doorway to a new location. It was cold but manageable. I stepped out into some light snow tightening my jacket. I didn‚Äôt bring gloves which August noticed. He pulled out a pair and helped me put them on as his dad's reflexes kicked in. I let him but flinched when my bruised fingers bent. I knew Dr. Fillow had access to magic bandages that healed faster however the broken bones recovered sooner than I expected.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúWe need to get up the side of the mountain. You‚Äôll be too slow. I need to carry you.‚Äù He explained. ¬†

I frowned glancing around to look for any witnesses. We were on a slight snowy slope with patches of trees. In front of us was a sparking mountain with the wind starting to pick up. He was right. I would never be able to walk up there without help.¬† ¬†

He got on one knee so I could climb on his back. August easily took off, running through the snow or jumping between the trees. The cool breeze felt nice on my face. This place had pure clean air that was perfect for supernatural creatures. We had only been here for a short while but August seemed to be recovering some of his internal magic source.¬† ¬†

As we moved, I saw glimpses of some buildings through the trees. Normally humans didn‚Äôt live in magic-rich places like this. It attracted many dangerous creatures. I couldn‚Äôt get a clear look at how many buildings there were in the distance or what kind they were. ¬†

It only took us ten minutes to get halfway up the mountain. I found it slightly hard to breathe but it was manageable. August wasn‚Äôt wearing shoes which helped him jump between small ledges. His clawed hands jabbed into the rocks climbing as if he had done this a hundred times before.¬† ¬†

We entered in a narrow opening to see a small cave glowing blue with an unknown light source. So far August hadn‚Äôt told me the reason why we were here. He went over to the back wall of the cave placing a clawed hand on the smooth rock. Delicate odd symbols appeared across the rocks creating an outline of a door. He nodded and walked forward sinking into the stone. ¬†

I followed behind unsure of what to expect. I nearly walked off a small platform. A set of spiral stairs curved along the wall so far down I couldn‚Äôt see the bottom. Along the walls were carved out holes in the rock covered with black fabric. Before I could ask what this place was, August picked me up so we could take the fastest way down. ¬†

If I wasn‚Äôt so shocked I would have screamed. I swear we fell for a full five minutes. We slowed before hitting the ground and gently landed. August needed to hold me up because my knees refused to stop shaking. He smiled amused with himself. ¬†

When I could walk again, he brought me over to a black-covered shape. Carefully he lifted the dusty fabric to show what was hidden away. The beauty of it took my breath away. A crystalized figure rested against a rock as if they had simply fallen asleep. They had the same claws and insect features August did. The long hair shimmered like silver spider webs. A set¬†of four delicate dragon fly-like wings were tucked against their body. There was no internal magic source. This supernatural creature had passed away a long time ago. ¬†

‚ÄúThis is my great-grandmother,‚Äù August explained. ¬†

I looked around realizing that this place was filled with more bodies like this one.¬†

‚ÄúI heard you‚Äôre in debt.‚Äù¬† ¬†

I turned my head back toward August understanding why he would ask such a question but still confused about why we came here. Bodies of powerful supernatural creatures were in high demand. Even after their internal magic gets used up, their flesh and bones can still be used in spells or formed into weapons. If August sold a pure body like this one, I could pay off my debt ten times over. ¬†

‚ÄúThis is your family. You shouldn‚Äôt have even brought me here. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù ¬†

He didn‚Äôt show any signs of distress no matter how hard I looked. ¬†

‚ÄúI have a dangerous job. If I die, I want to have someone I can trust with all this until April is ready. But, if possible, I never want to burden her with this. His grave is only a rumor at the moment. If anyone found out it was real you can imagine how much trouble it would cause the person protecting it.‚Äù ¬†

I looked around again understanding his point. Most people would see these bodies as raw materials. The amount of sheer power that could be produced was hard to imagine. If one person used all of this for their gain, they might be able to take over the world a hundred times over. People have killed for a fraction of this kind of magic. ¬†

‚ÄúI'm the only one who can open the door. If I die without giving someone access here, it‚Äôll be sealed forever.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt the right be automatically passed to April?‚Äù I wondered out loud. ¬†

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt share fathers.‚Äù¬† ¬†

That made sense. I hadn‚Äôt been thinking properly lately. They were half siblings but not once did he treat her any differently. Even though this grave belonged to his species he loved his little sister so much he didn‚Äôt want to burden her with it.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúAre you sure you trust me? I mean, I could turn around and sell even ten of your dead family members and solve all my problems.‚Äù I gestured around us. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think would happen if The Corporation got a hold of even half of these bodies?‚Äù He pressed. ¬†

I stopped to think for a moment. It didn‚Äôt take very long to figure out how terrible of an outcome that would be. ¬†

‚ÄúThey might be able to completely control a few worlds worth of supernatural creatures. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. I hate how often Agents die to protect humans. If they had this power, I know they would start killing off creatures that need to feed on humans to live. People like you would be slaughtered. They have always said they simply want to protect the balance between creatures and humans. But I feel like they love humans too much. It‚Äôs... complicated. I don‚Äôt have the answers. I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable giving anyone access to any of this. Even with good intentions, it would just lead to problems.‚Äù ¬†

I‚Äôve seen both sides suffer. People much smarter than myself had thought their entire lives about how monsters and humans could live together. From my experience, letting one side have power over the other did not solve anything.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúHave you talked to April about all of this? Wouldn‚Äôt she be upset that you gave this responsibility to me?‚Äù I asked him wondering her opinion on all of this. ¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always known about the graves but she doesn‚Äôt fully understand how much potential is sealed away here. I asked her what she would do with one body of a crystalized relative and...‚Äù He trailed off for a second as if reliving a traumatic event. ‚ÄúApril said she would eat it, get really big, and stomp through a city like Godzilla.‚Äù ¬†

Yeah, she couldn‚Äôt be trusted with this. I held out my hand showing him I was ready to accept the heavy burden of keeping this grave hidden. The process was simple. He cut part of his palm then let the blood flow into my cupped hands. It fell into my skin leaving no traces behind.¬† ¬†

It was a bit strange that August took me here out of the blue. There was something about him that felt a little bit off but I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. This was similar to a friend suddenly making a will. Of course, I would think something might be wrong.¬† ¬†

Since we were done, I needed to climb back onto his back so he could quickly get us up to the door. August was skilled at climbing even with the extra weight. Since I‚Äôd spent time with him on jobs he wasn‚Äôt suited for, I didn‚Äôt realize just how strong he could be.¬† ¬†

We still needed to get back down the mountain after leaving the tomb. The fastest way would be to create a door. August didn‚Äôt mention any other reason why he wanted to come here so I assumed he would head back home. Instead, he took a running start jumping off the side of the ledge to get down the mountain the second fastest way.¬† ¬†

My stomach lifted into my throat as we started to free fall. For a second before the fear took over, I was able to take in the beauty of the area. The sparkling snow-covered slope dotted with trees made me realize why his family members wanted to fight to stay here. ¬†

Even sturdy supernatural creatures would have been harmed falling from such a height. August knew what he was doing. He used his power to slow our fall before we hit the ground in such a gentle way, that I didn‚Äôt even notice the decrease in speed until we safely landed. It was a very impressive display of control that most people would not have been able to do. I still felt sick from the fall and once his feet touched the ground I climbed off his back and fell backwards into the snow. Our lunch bag landed next to me. I reached for it but gave up laying with my arms sprawled out and eyes closed embracing the cold on my back. ¬†

I did think I was going to die when he jumped. My stomach had yet to settle but for some odd reason, I felt more relaxed than I had for weeks. The pain in my bad leg felt so faint it might as well not be there. ¬†

‚ÄúRichie, are you alright?‚Äù August asked in a heavy tone. ¬†

I didn‚Äôt open my eyes and just nodded. ¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do well with heights.‚Äù I admitted.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I meant.‚Äù He responded. ¬†

Glancing up at him I thought back to everything that had happened recently. It felt like I‚Äôd been rotting from the inside and just did my best to ignore it. Any time something happened I risked falling apart. I realized that I‚Äôve felt like this since I lost my partner. I tried to pretend as if I was fine and attempted at a normal life. When that didn‚Äôt work out, I went back to contract work that put me in danger. Broken bones, near-death experiences, and being scared to death felt right. If the person I cared about the most died because I was weak, why should I have a comfortable life? ¬†

Was I alright? ¬†

No. I‚Äôve been working towards a slow suicide since I lost her.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúWhat about you? It feels like something is going on you‚Äôre not telling me about.‚Äù ¬†

I sat up and brushed the snow from my jacket. It warmed up a little since we got here. Still, I would kill for a hot coffee at that moment. ¬†

‚ÄúDo you want to see the tree I was born under? We landed nearby.‚Äù He said refusing to answer my question. ¬†

Without waiting he started walking through the trees heading towards a large pine standing near a clearing. He stopped in front of it to pat the bark. He looked like a person who just found an old childhood toy. ¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice-looking tree. Can we get back to my question?‚Äù I pressed after I caught up with him. ¬†

‚ÄúMy species lays an egg under the ground. When I hatched, I had to dig up through the roots. I didn‚Äôt even have a human body for the first ten years.‚Äù He said then paused for a moment almost deep in thought. ‚ÄúRichmond, I could tell you what has been bothering me however you wouldn‚Äôt understand it. I‚Äôm not the same as you.‚Äù¬†

We stood a few feet from each other a cold wind blowing between us. He was right. I would never fully understand what pain he‚Äôs gone through. I‚Äôm human. He‚Äôs not. Our lives are very different. But I could still support him if he was going through a hard time. Right now, he was acting like an older brother. He wanted to act like a bad guy to create distance between us so he wouldn‚Äôt burden me with his issues. I didn‚Äôt fully open up to him so how could I be upset he refused so as well? ¬†

‚ÄúIs this about Lucas?‚Äù I asked carefully well aware that if I said the wrong thing at that moment, I would break¬†our friendship. ¬†

I thought he would just doge any topics he didn‚Äôt want to address. When his hands turned into claws and August darted forward ready to rip apart flesh I was too stunned to react. Warm blood splashed against my back after the attack. Slowly I turned around to see a body bleeding out on the ground. ¬†

More figures appeared in the trees. I was confused about how they got so close. I should have sensed a supernatural threat sooner. They all looked somewhat normal. They were dressed in warm clothing with heavy gloved and reflective goggles while others simply wore sweaters. Any exposed skin was red from the cold and some looked to hand frostbite starting at their fingertips. Each held a weapon that looked like just random objects they found. Some with knives others with large sticks. They weren‚Äôt a threat to August but I would have trouble with these numbers. ¬†

The crowd moved in a zombified state and yet I couldn‚Äôt see any traces of a spell controlling them. This was odd. I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. Another person darted forward in a weak attack. I easily stepped aside and then watched in horror when August swiftly sliced through the woman‚Äôs neck. On reflex I caught her trying to help but she was dead within seconds. ¬†

‚ÄúAugust! They‚Äôre human, stop!‚Äù I told him frantic. ¬†

We needed to think things through before acting. He was bound by a collar. If he killed humans without a good reason, The Corporation would punish him.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúTwo days ago, all the humans at the ski lodge nearby disappeared. They assumed April or I were involved with whoever caused the trouble as revenge for our home being taken away.‚Äù¬† August explained but refused to look in my direction. ‚ÄúRichmond, leave. I‚Äôll take care of things here.‚Äù ¬†

I carefully placed the body of the poor woman we were unable to save on the ground. Her blood had seeped into my clothing and the cold air already started to freeze it.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúIf I do that, they won‚Äôt listen to anything I say. I know you‚Äôre not working with the person behind all this. If you live through confronting the one who did this then you‚Äôll be killed by The Corporation.‚Äù I sternly said.¬† ¬†

He moved again far too quickly to stop. Another slash of his claws came down killing an easy target. Fresh blood dripped from his fingers with his back facing me.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the plan.‚Äù His voice was steady and it chilled me more than the wind. ¬†

‚ÄúLike hell to that! You need to stay alive for Lucas!‚Äù I scolded him as if he was a child.¬† ¬†

I was so focused on him I didn‚Äôt notice someone heading my way with a knife in hand. August did. He lashed out taking them down but didn‚Äôt stop there. I was unable to stop him from killing three more people. He paused to take a deep breath his emotions finally breaking. ¬†

‚ÄúLucas won‚Äôt be coming back home. He‚Äôs human. I‚Äôm not. They decided his biological family would raise him.‚Äù He sounded so defeated at that moment. ¬†

No wonder he‚Äôd given up. He couldn‚Äôt handle losing his family again. He assumed April hated him because he didn‚Äôt fight for their home. He knew she would be fine without him and decided to die letting people assume it was for revenge.¬† ¬†

Sure, I had somewhat been acting the same way as him recently but I refused to leave him to die here.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôm taking you home.‚Äù I told him only to be ignored. ¬†

He refused to listen, to just stay still. He simply kept digging his graves by killing others. I went to him, grabbing a hold of his arm and using all my strength to try to make him stop. He spun around, slamming his hand hard against a tree. We stood facing each other, specks of blood across his face half hidden by his wavy hair.¬†

‚ÄúLook at me.‚Äù He demanded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a monster. Accept that.‚Äù ¬†

I had a bad habit of turning a blind eye to difficult things to make my life easier. I knew August wasn‚Äôt human. I didn‚Äôt know if I accepted what that truly meant or didn‚Äôt acknowledge his faults so we could become friends.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúHumans and monsters should not interact no matter how much we love each other. It only caused pain. Isn‚Äôt that the reason why Ito dumped you?‚Äù ¬†

He was trying to be cruel so I would leave. The words still hurt.¬†

‚ÄúAre you just going to give up? Once you do there‚Äôs no turning back. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll figure something out.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit, my words sounded weak. ¬†

A scowl came to his face as he started to snap.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúOh, why didn‚Äôt I think of that? I‚Äôll just try harder then!‚Äù He hissed and turned to take his anger out on the half-frozen targets. ¬†

It was sickening to watch him rip people to pieces unable to do anything about it. Pent-up anger came out with sloppy attacks. His human mask becomes more monstrous with each passing second. ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already worked so damn hard and nothing I do matters! Humans take away everything I care about and yet I still care about them! I can‚Äôt have a family because I‚Äôm not like what I love no matter what I do! I can‚Äôt change what I am, it‚Äôs so damn frustrating!‚Äù ¬†

He paused to try and calm down, his chest heaving with heavy breaths. August gritted his teeth holding down more rage that threatened to boil over. We both knew he was the best person to raise Lucas. But the higher-ups didn‚Äôt see that. They only saw a monster around a defenseless human child and assumed his biological family would be better. They were the people who didn‚Äôt look for Lucas when he went missing. They didn‚Äôt care what happened to his parents. They only wanted him after they found out how much money he came with. August found the boy. He was Lucas‚Äô father the moment they saw each other.¬†

I looked away from him trying to think of what I could do. August would be in deep trouble if anyone found out he slaughtered humans he could have easily run from. Should I lie and say I was the one who killed them? And then what? How could we get his son back after we deal with the issue at hand. My chest hurt seeing the gore on the ground he created. Then, something caught my eye forcing me to focus on a cracked-open skull. ¬†

There was a glitter of magic. A small thread inside. It took some effort but I saw more of those threads woven inside the heads of all the people around us. That was how they were being controlled. They may be alive but the threads had made them brain-dead puppets. Killing them had been a mercy. Did August already know that? A skilled supernatural doctor would notice the threads if they knew to look. So, August was in the clear. ¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the answers for you. But I‚Äôm not leaving you to die. Mostly because it might be too late now.‚Äù I told August as I tensed up waiting for the next threat to arrive. ¬†

Unlike the human puppets around us, I sensed the new person heading our way. His power looked and felt the same as the magic that ran through the mountain. Even at a distance, I knew this threat was strong. Much stronger than August. He was on his home turf but he hadn‚Äôt had much time to recover since we arrived here. ¬†

‚ÄúYou humans always cause so much trouble.‚Äù August muttered almost to himself and turned toward the newcomer. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you agree, June?‚Äù ¬†

A person walked through the trees stopping to admire the scene. He was tall and thin wearing ripped bloody clothing he‚Äôd stolen from a previous victim. The left side of his face had been completely scarred over. His long wavy dark hair reached down to his waist swaying in the cool breeze. His skin appeared stretched over an oddly shaped skeletal structure aside from his left arm. It was completely transformed into a shiny black clawed hand with joints similar to a doll.¬† ¬†

Clearly, he had been a survivor of the attack that wiped out his entire village. He waited until he was strong enough to take back the mountain but also to lure in August. I doubted June would be on friendly terms with his surviving family members after they sided with humans. ¬†

‚ÄúYou were kind to me when we were younger, I won‚Äôt kill you right away. I‚Äôll give you a few moments with your little vermin.‚Äù June said his voice was deep and damaged. ¬†

I stood firm getting ready for what we would need to deal with. Glancing between June and August I knew we were in a bit of trouble. The best course of action was to run and get help if that was even possible. ¬†

‚ÄúYour internal magic is low. His isn‚Äôt. From the looks of things, he has three times as much magic as you.‚Äù I explained as if August didn‚Äôt already know all that. ¬†

I shuffled closer to him watching June expecting him to attack at any moment.¬† ¬†

‚ÄúYou have good senses. It might help us out. I‚Äôll create a door, hold him off and you can open the connection to get away when you see an opening.‚Äù ¬†

We were nearly touching shoulders. I carefully looked around trying not to be noticed. At some point, June had taken control of the magic flowing through the ground and trees around us. That sucked. It blocked us off from creating a doorway out. ¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs blocked us. No doors, we‚Äôre stuck.‚Äù I whispered trying not to be overheard. ¬†

‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù August raised an eyebrow. ¬†

‚ÄúI can see it.‚Äù I answered and a longer silence came between us than I expected. ¬†

August stared at me as if I was crazy. Couldn‚Äôt all supernatural creatures see magic? It suddenly dawned on me that my eyesight was better than most. If every creature could see exactly what they were dealing with and how much power each other held the world would be much different. Sure, I realized I had a useful skill but clearly seeing what kind of threat we faced didn‚Äôt solve our problem. The monster in front of us was still going to rip us apart. He only hadn‚Äôt just to amuse himself. ¬†

‚ÄúAre you two finished chatting?‚Äù¬† ¬†

June‚Äôs voice made us tense up. We did not have a plan. I‚Äôve lived through bigger threats before. Maybe I would figure something out in the next few seconds. ¬†

Cracks appeared in Jun‚Äôs flesh. His chest puffed out as cracking sounds echoed around it. His body started to become deformed. With an awful ripping sound, the flesh covering his ribcage split open revealing a large vertical mouth with dripping teeth. He kept pulling power out of the ground. Small glittering cracks formed across his face. He grew larger hunching over appearing more like a beast than a human.¬† ¬†

The foul magic coming off of him made my stomach churn. Simply being nearby made my legs tremble. Pure hatred fueled him so intensely that I didn‚Äôt know how he was keeping his deformed body together.¬†

¬†Again, I looked around for anything useful. I doubted the small knives and sharp sticks the human puppets brought along would do anything. My eyes landed on a woman with her throat slit and deep red blood staining her light brown hair. My vision started to go grey at the edges. For a moment I saw my dead partner‚Äôs face and I nearly lost myself in that terrible memory. ¬†

This situation felt like the same one back then. Utterly hopeless facing a monster we had no chance against. By some miracle, I lived. She didn‚Äôt. I saw her lifeless body but it was never found, most likely consumed by the creature who attacked us.¬† ¬†

While I was distracted June attacked. Before I could even blink, he was in front of me his large clawed hand curled into a powerful blow. I raised my right arm grabbing whatever magic I could from the ground to soften the blow. I was knocked back a few feet, the bones in my arm shattering. August appeared to move in slow motion compared to the monster before us. ¬†

He dodged an attack that would have ripped out his throat but was stuck three times in the stomach and chest so hard blood came from his mouth. He was knocked back landing hard on the ground next to me.¬† ¬†

No matter how hard I tried to think of a plan the horrible truth became crystal clear.¬† ¬†

We were fucked.¬† ¬†",5,1736875814.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Especially after what you've been through.

Sure. Good to meet you too.

So, first off, my name is Isa. I'm one of Dr Lundstr√∂m's students, so I'm not officially a therapist yet, but I'm well on my way to becoming one. I have a Bachelor's in Psychology with an emphasis in cognitive behavioral therapy. Is that okay? I'm confident that we can still do some good work together.

Yeah, that's fine.

Awesome. So another thing, since I'm a student, our sessions will be recorded. My computer is on and the camera is recording sound, but no picture. This is just for Dr Lundstr√∂m's use in her teaching, and, well I guess you could say I'm being graded on this. [laugh] 

Oh. Okay.

Are you okay with all that? It's totally fine if you aren't, we can find you a more senior therapist if you aren't comfortable with this.

No, that's fine.

Awesome. How old are you, Damien?

Seventeen. Eighteen this September.

Okay. Well, Mel told me some stuff, but I'd still like to hear it from you just in case he got something wrong. Your dad passed away?

[cough] Yeah. Like, two days ago or something. I don't know.

I'm so sorry. I lost my own father. I can never understand exactly what you're going through, but I can certainly relate to your pain.

[cough] Yeah. Thanks.

Have you spoken to your mother since then?

Just once at the police station when I was arrested. Then Mel showed me a text from her. I left my phone back home. Didn't think to take it when they were arresting me.

Understandable. Well, how do you think she's doing?

I mean, she probably feels like shit. Her husband of sixteen years is dead and the world thinks her son killed him.

That's terrible. I'm sorry about all this.

It's fine. I mean, it's not fine. But it's fine. You know what I mean.

They were married for sixteen years?

Yeah, almost seventeen. They met when I was a baby.

And your birth father?

Never met him. Hm.

You look like you were thinking about something.

It's just, it's weird. I was seeing a therapist back in Utah before all this happened. She told me to write a letter to my birth dad as an exercise. Obviously he'd never read it, but it was meant to be for me, you know?

Sure. That can be very helpful. Was it?

I don't know. I was in the middle of writing it when‚Ä¶when it happened.

Would you mind taking me through what happened, Damien? Or is it too soon?

I don't know. [cough] I don't know.

That's okay. We can put that aside. If you don't mind my asking, what was in the letter?

Just, you know, wishing I knew who he was, and asking where he was and what his life was like, if he was alive, if he had another family. Huh. You know, I just realized I could have half-siblings somewhere on earth. Weird.

That is weird. Does that bother you, the thought of him having a family?

Not really. I don't know. Maybe. I guess, if that was the case, I'd like to know why he left. 

Your mom never talks about him?

Never. I asked her once, back when I was like twelve or something. She gave me this weird look. Not angry, but still scary. Almost sad. Disappointed. I don't know. I'm not good at judging emotions.

I see. Damien, I was wondering, if it's okay, can we talk about the other night at the cabin?

Oh man. Um. I don't know. This is all so fresh, you know? I mean‚Ä¶I'm still grappling with the realization that monsters exist. Like, holy shit. There are werewolves and vampires and goblins? And Stella is an alien or something, and Olan is a demon, or a half-demon, I don't know. I don't think Marco is anything, but I didn't get the chance to ask before all this happened, and then it felt weird to ask him afterward. He seemed, I mean him and Cody, they seemed like friends from what I saw. 

Yes, from what I understand they were close. Were you close with your stepdad?

I mean, yeah. He was my dad. The only father I've ever known. He raised me with my mom. He was a good guy.

But you don't want to talk about what happened.

Not now. No. If that's okay.

Anything you want to do is okay, Damien. Would you like to talk about Van Helsing? How did you like it, when you first saw it?

I mean, it's cool. It's really pretty here. Lots of mountains and trees. The air feels good. And the town is nice. Olan took me to get coffee and buy some clothes and other things I needed. I didn't get a chance to pack before coming here.

Sure. And you're staying with Olan, Fox, and Sandy? 

Yeah. He introduced me right after we came through the‚Ä¶the fucking portal. God. This is all so‚Ä¶ I don't know. It's a lot. Does the government, do the governments of the world, the ruling class or whoever, do they know about all this? That monsters and magic exist?

Yes, I'm sure they do. Does that upset you?

Kind of. Like, regular people are kept in the dark on purpose, for what? Why?

I'm not sure I'm qualified to give an answer to that, Damien.

Well. Anyway. Fox is a werewolf. I'm sure you knew. Sandy is normal. Or, human. Sorry. It's probably offensive to say normal. She's a muggle. [laugh]

I think the accepted verbage is wiffic for anyone with an amount of non-human heritage, and human for everyone else.

Where does that word come from? Wiffic.

Honestly I have know idea. Sometimes words are just‚Ä¶created. For no good reason. But you like Fox and Sandy?

Oh yeah, sorry. Yeah, they seem nice. They explained the werewolf thing, how they lock him up in the basement every month, but it's only a precaution because he loads up with carbs the night before so he's not ravenous after the transformation. I had never thought of that, but it makes sense. Shit, I've never thought anything about werewolves. And Sandy is human. There was an awkward moment while we were talking and she mentioned that her dad doesn't approve of her and Fox's relationship because he was old-fashioned. I assumed it was because Fox is black. But no, Sandy's dad is the head of a monster hunting group. I guess they're the seal team 6 of killing monsters or something. Was I being racist? I don't know how anything works anymore.

I'm sure it was fine, Damien. I'm sure they found your‚Ä¶na√Øvety amusing. 

Is that what I am? Na√Øve?

What word would you use?

Probably ignorant. But I want to learn. Especially after‚Ä¶

Yes? After what?

After what happened to my dad. It makes more sense now, what happened. The weird ritual. The candles. The voice‚Ä¶ He was involved in this community, wasn't he? You knew him, or knew of him. And my mom. She sent Mel to break me out of the station. She knew about this place. Maybe even meant for me to come here all along.
Wait. That's it, isn't it? My birth father. He was‚Ä¶something, wasn't he? And I bet you know. Mel knows. 

I promise you I don't know who your father is, Damien.

But you do know that I'm‚Ä¶a wiffic.

You're a very intelligent young man, Damien.

No, it's just pretty obvious, the way people have been treating me.

Are people treating you differently?

No, that's just it. They're treating me like I'm one of them. When Olan walked me through the town after we came out of the portal, he waved at people and introduced me to neighbors and friends, and they all greeted me with the same look in their eyes, like‚Ä¶complete understanding. Like they shared something unspoken with me. And then when we got to the house and I met Sandy and Fox, it was the same thing with him. But not with Sandy. She had that ""I'm not LGBT, but I am an ally"" look in her eyes. Does that make sense?

Actually it does. But you feel welcome here?

Yeah, I really do.

I can tell something is on your mind, Damien. Can you let me in?

It's just‚Ä¶the night Cody was killed. I think I saw something. But it might've been a dream. I don't know.

Could you tell me?

After we all went back into our rooms and Mel was wrapping Cody up in a blanket, I might've fallen asleep. Maybe not, though. It's hard to imagine sleeping after seeing that. But some time later I was looking out the window. I thought I heard something. It was totally dark out and I couldn't see anything but the moon. But there were two figures standing there under a tree. They looked young. Like kids. And they both stared at me and smiled. Their eyes were black. I don't know how I could tell, since everything was dark and everything looked black, but somehow I could tell that their eyes were totally black.

Did you tell Mel? Or Olan? Anyone?

Personally I‚Äôve never had an appetite in the mornings my whole life, so I‚Äôve always skipped breakfasts and just have a coffee. Then with working a construction job all I really take for a break to eat is just my lunch, so skipping those little snacks I feel most people have. Gym after work, I have a shake once I get home and then it‚Äôs eating dinner with my spouse where I just down a large amount. 

I‚Äôm still making my desired calories/protein intake but would there be more benefits to spreading it out compared to cramming them in? Curious to the reasoning of why that might not be as good as spaced out servings.

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old from Europe, and I‚Äôm here looking for a connection that feels authentic‚Äîsomething built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I‚Äôm open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I‚Äôm a writer at heart‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs fascinated by the world‚Äôs little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there‚Äôs poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I‚Äôd describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I‚Äôm on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I‚Äôm always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it‚Äôs hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I‚Äôve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon‚Äîit‚Äôs all about balance, right?

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs as curious about life as I am. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You‚Äôre the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you‚Äôre not afraid to embrace them. You‚Äôre willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together‚Äîa shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I‚Äôd like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I‚Äôll remember the little things about you‚Äîthe way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you‚Äôre too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I‚Äôm loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it‚Äôs through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter‚Äîmoments that turn into memories we‚Äôll always carry.

# Let‚Äôs Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let‚Äôs talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we‚Äôll just start with ‚Äúhello‚Äù and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step‚Äîthis could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. üòä",1,1736875436.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I'm keeping a Daily Notes journal that is a log of things like my weight, number of coffees each day, vitamins, etc.

I would like to formulate this in a way that I can write these things down in Daily Notes and have it be calculated into a ""Weekly Summary"" sheet... then of course a Monthly Summary as well. The weekly summary would automatically populate and calculate these fields from the week's daily notes, meaning no manual steps required to configure it, I just fill in my Daily Notes and that's that. Ideally the links wouldn't need updated in the Weekly Summaries, they would just follow the format of the note titles to link the days(example title of todays daily note is ""1-14-25"").

The monthly would do the same, only looking at the Weekly Summaries.

Obviously there may be some automation/scripting necessary for this... and I also see some people using RAG for something like this, but in my experience it is best to not fully rely on RAG/AI(and I'm also obsessed with efficiency), so essentially I treat AI as the last resort option instead of first choice.

My question to you is, if this is feasible without SecondBrain, etc - and if so, could you provide any helpful resources to understand how I might go about building this process within Obsidian?",1,1736875375.0,ObsidianMD,0,1.0,False

My parents already have four cats (Margaret 18F, Behemoth 8F, Gollum 11M, Coffee 10M) and have just attempted to introduce a new one (Panda 1M) because a friend of a friend was no longer able to take care of him and my parents are suckers for a sob story (we have had 5 cats before at once and it's been fine). Of the existing ones, they all get along with each other really well apart from Behemoth, but she mostly hangs out in the spare room with me and my husband as we're staying with my parents to save up for our own place in 2026, at which point we'll take Behemoth with us.

Against my advice and wishes, my parents introduced Panda to the others in a way that was really, really rushed. We got him last Friday and he was immediately let out of his carrier and loose in the house, with no slow introduction at all, no putting him in a room by himself to acclimatise, no scent swapping with the others. By Monday, he had attacked Coffee, biting him in the face and giving him a cut on his nose, near his eye. He has also run up behind Margaret to attack her but she's deaf (and has cancer, so is quite frail), so didn't hear him coming and didn't fight back, so Panda backed off.

Because Monday's fight with Coffee seemed so unprovoked and vicious (and Coffee only has 3 legs), my parents thought that Panda wasn't a right fit for this house and started looking at ways to rehome him this morning (Tuesday), but they couldn't find anything but shelters. I'd like to try again with him because he's great with people (in fact, the quickest to warm to people of all the cats we've ever had), keeping him in an office for a week or so on his own, out of the others' way, then scent swapping, them letting him meet the others while he's in a carrier, then supervised visits with the others so that he doesn't get a chance to attack them.

My question is, has the damage been done and Panda has already burned his bridges with Margaret and Coffee? Can this situation be salvaged with a slow introduction after they've already had a very rushed introduction? Is my plan okay with keeping him separate, then supervised visits? If so, what kind of timeframe would be good for each step of that process?

We've had all the others as either rescue kittens or rescue elderly cats, so never a young 1-year-old cat, so any advice is appreciated!",1,1736875312.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

salt and black pepper, to season beef
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 yellow onions, chopped
7 slices bacon, chopped
3 1/2 Tbsp all purpose flour

5 Tbsp tomato paste
3 cups chicken stock
4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-1"" slices
2 celery stalks, cut into 1"" pieces

2 bay leaves
1 tsp dried thyme (or use 3-4 sprigs fresh thyme)
1/4 cup brewed coffee

Add beef, in a single layer, to the pot and brown on all sides. Be careful, as the oil may spatter. Remove browned beef to a plate, then repeat with remaining beef.
Lower heat to MED, then add chopped onions and garlic. Season with salt, and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
Add bacon pieces and cook until browned. Add flour and stir to combine well. Let floured mixture cook 1 minute to remove any raw flour taste. Start your journey to good health any favorites foods.

And also sorry for the length, I just want to be clear about what I mean.

Anyway, I (28 year old male) don't feel like I have passion for anything. Career, hobby, romance etc. I have a stable job and income, my own apartment, I'm close to my family, I have multiple close friends and we share everything with eachother. I feel very lucky and privileged in these regards.

But despite this I don't feel passion. I have multiple friends, coworkers and acquaintances say things like: ""man, I can't wait to get home and [insert hobby/activity]"" I have never felt this, I have felt things like ""I can't wait to get home and just relax/sleep"" or along those lines.

I have been active in political organisations, made music with friends (including recording with a professional producer and releasing songs), I was even active in church a couple of years back. But I've never felt a ""deep desire"" to do any of these things. It felt like it was just something amusing to do in order to pass the time. I that what ""passion"" feels like?

I have no dreams. When playing music with my friends my only thought was ""this is nice"". Doing political activities, ""this is nice"". Watching an awesome concert, ""this is nice"". In the same way drinking a cup of coffee is nice. In the same way, going to the cinema is nice. This ""lack of passion"" has made me stop doing these things. My friends can work on music for hours with or without people around them, same with my political colleagues. 

I have been struggling with anxiety for about 4 years. And I started taking antidepressants (SSRI) since 2 months back. I don't know if that's relevant, but I just put it in there.

Also the endoscopy did not show anything except that it brought the diagnosis. 

The odd thing is, that I don't smoke, rarely drink and don't take and medication linked to the condition. I assume it's because of my love for spicy and fatty food, coffee and coke but that's just a guess. It could also be because I took an antibiotic previously and my stomach maybe did not fully recover from that. Idk and my doctor could not really give me much advice except for ""Eat healthier and try these acid surpressing meds"".

I have been doing that and I generally have a healthy lifestyle, do sport 3-4x a week and eat lots of whole foods. 

I wondering if there is someone that has the same condition and managed to get it under control or what his/her experience is. I also read that it can be healed over time etc. You got any advice or anything that might help? My doctor did not really give me much to work with so I thought I try my luck here.

I wasn't in the mood for anything just focused on getting home. However, as I passed through the market, I spotted a girl who caught my attention. I thought about talking to her, so I parked my vehicle and approached her. She was adorable, wearing glasses, and her smile was just cute. We struck up a conversation, and I complimented her. Then I suggested we go for some momo, and to my surprise, she said yes! I was overwhelmed and a bit nervous by her response, and then we went for Momo and talked so much about everything. She is a cabin crew, so she was telling me about her work and everything. I was just listening.

After that, we went for a coffee, and we just talked about everything, from movies to life. She was telling me why she watched Harry Potter all the parts 9 times in a week, and I was so fkn nervous. I was like, still processing the whole situation. Then we had coffee, and after that, We were waiting for her friend to come. Then we went back to the place where we met. and it got late. Then my dad called me, and I had to leave. Also, she had a flight the next day. So, we decided that when she comes back, we‚Äôll go watch a movie together. Then we hugged, exchanged Instagram id, and left. (We were together for like 3 hours.)

But after that, I texted her, and she‚Äôs just replying dry or just ignoring idk why. Like one-word replies. Help me, guys, what to do here? i really don't want to mess this up:)))))",16,1736874783.0,Indiangirlsontinder,32,1.0,False

For the past few months though I haven‚Äôt been doing too well on the apps and decided to delete them. I am a senior at college, and I‚Äôm trying to date women outside of dating apps. How am I supposed to do this? 

I go to bars a lot, but I‚Äôm always intimidated to talking to women in groups since I don‚Äôt have any friends to go to bars with. I know people say social/hobby clubs are good places to meet  women, but honestly I know that I would only join these clubs so for the sole purpose of meeting women so that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do them. On top of that, since I‚Äôm in my last semester, college classes aren‚Äôt an option because it‚Äôs too short of a time frame to build a relationship with someone.

The only time I had success in meeting women outside of dating apps was a woman I met at a coffee shop. I came up to this woman, struck a conversation and afterwards went on a few dates with her before we both found out that we weren‚Äôt a fit.

So I guess I have more than just one question. How do I meet women outside of dating apps. I heard some women don‚Äôt mind ‚Äúcold approaching‚Äù and others hate it. I don‚Äôt want to be creepy so that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do it often. I know bars my or may not be a good place to meet women, but I want to be able to talk to women at bars because there are some women at the bar I go to I find attractive, but never got the courage to talk to them because they are with their friends.

1i1avvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1i1avvf/beyond_ultimate_southern_caribbean_10_nights_jan/,Beyond Ultimate Southern Caribbean (10 nights) Jan ‚Äò25 Notes,"Wife and I are late 50‚Äôs (how did that happen?), experienced but infrequent cruisers, minor mobility issues. We‚Äôve sailed on most of the major lines, and last on Celebrity in 2004. No special status or perks and can spend money but usually prefer not to unless there‚Äôs clear value. Attached are some notes from our trip provided in case they‚Äôre useful to anyone else; your mileage (and opinion) may vary.

Stuff to bring: 

   [ ] Magnetic hooks for the room - Amazon - pack of 12 - got this idea from this forum and they were lifesavers for hanging wet bathing suits, coverups, hats, etc. 

   [ ] Towel clips for chairs - as seems to be the case everywhere these days, if you don‚Äôt get out there by about 0800 you‚Äôre going to have trouble finding two chairs together that aren‚Äôt in an inconvenient / less-desirable place on deck. A lot of people were using either bands that went around the back of a chair to large squeeze clips to hold towels to chairs. These would be worth packing.

   [ ] Rain ponchos - hard to find ashore and $13 onboard; $1 at Walmart ahead of time. We had brief showers a couple of our shore days and would have liked to have had these for insurance.

   [ ] Umbrellas - as above, depending on your risk tolerance. We brought a small one and were glad we had it just in case.

   [ ] Rash guards - long sleeve quick-dry shirts were nice for long days on deck

   [ ] Snorkel pouch for phones - cheap and easy to bring for underwater photos, hard to find ashore.

   [ ] Enough cash for excursion tips - we underestimated tips / incidentals in planning and the $200 US cash we brought was barely enough (so that‚Äôs $50/day for two of us for each shore day). There is an ATM onboard and we would have used it if we‚Äôd had one more day ashore. Most stores had electronic payment available but it didn‚Äôt always work, and street vendors were cash-only. US accepted everywhere. Note that different islands used different native currencies.

   [ ] Clothesline? We saw another room had a clothesline in it, but are not sure how they attached it

   [ ] Hand sanitizer - small, portable bottle for piece of mind before meals ahore

   [ ] Evening bag (vs beach / pool bag) - small purse for the ladies to bring to dinner / around ship

   [ ] Yeti tumbler - I‚Äôm not a brand guy, but our new Yeti tumbler was amazing at keeping things cold. It‚Äôs coming everywhere now.


Excursions / Referrals: we did three short excursions via Celebrity and two via ShoreEx. In all three cases, the Celebrity tours were more crowded, less comfortable, and less enjoyable than the outside ones. Guides / chaperones on the outside tours were much more engaged and personable than the Celebrity-sponsored ones. The age-old concern about outside vendors not getting you back to the ship on time has always resonated with us - we‚Äôre pretty risk-averse - but in every case our operators knew exactly when we needed to be back and made darn sure we had time to spare. In the outside tours, about 2/3 of the guests were from Beyond - which also added a little interesting nuance to conversations.

   [ ] St Maarten - Sailthephoenix.com - pleasant catamaran snorkel and home-cooked lunch on the boat, open bar. Really didn‚Äôt get to see any of the island because we were on the ship all day, probably a mistake, but we got what we asked for. Snorkeling was only OK over a pretty well-traveled snorkel spot and underwater tour path seeded with a helicopter, submarine, some statuary. 

   [ ] St Lucia - Jungle Tours via ShoreEx - tour guide Lloyd was outstanding - driving tour (bad roads) west side plus really fun mud bath (another $8 ea) and waterfall and chocolate shop - take Dramamine first - long drive. 

   [ ] Grenada - bus tour via Celebrity plus chocolate shop and 15 min waterfall. Nice to see the island but not worth $150. Ship would not have been a bad place to spend the day.  

   [ ] Barbados - Beautiful Bermuda Tours & Excursions via ShoreEx. Bathsheba view was awesome, beach rocky. Wildlife preserve + monkeys fun. Lots of driving but good roads. Lovely beach with food trucks, might have liked to try snorkel w/ turtles. Holetown pretty upscale. Could spend a few days here.

   [ ] Antigua - Nest Beach, via ship.  Hour from stateroom to bus. Tourist beach, crowded, ridiculous prices. Decent beach, no reason to go back to this beach or to use this company again.


Ship: loved Beyond - so artsy. 

‚Äî Staff was, as usual on these ships, great with a couple of standouts at both the high and low ends. 

‚Äî Ship is looooong. No trouble getting in 10K steps most days. A few cycles of stateroom-food-deck is plenty of walking.

‚Äî Theatre is a technical marvel and the production cast shows took full advantage of it - don‚Äôt miss them. Ship band and resident cast were terrific - so much talent there. The visiting acts were fine - lounge-singer quality, generally trying to do too much in a 45-minute show, but it was something to do in the evening after dinner. Not impressed by the Eden cast show in The Club.

‚Äî The Club was generally disappointing; layout supports a floor show but the live shows / game shows were meh at best and there are few seats with good views of the floor. Don‚Äôt waste your money on the Deal or No Deal game. Entertainment hosts (with the exception of Cruise Director Alexa) were over the top and quickly got annoying.

‚Äî Enjoyed just hanging out in the Grand Plaza and people watching / drinking. Loved the Silent Disco. Flair bartenders fun to watch and very personable.

‚Äî Liked the big screen in the Rooftop Garden for evening football games. Pretty constant and good-natured Pickleball competition up there.


Food:

‚Äî The buffet is amazing. Food was fine and the variety is incredible. Staff is very helpful. Hard not to overeat. 

‚Äî The four ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù restaurants were also fine - food quality one step above the buffet, still not gourmet by any stretch. Staff was obsequious, which one would expect. Never had to wait more than 5 min without reservations to get seated.

‚Äî The ‚Äúcafe‚Äôs‚Äù were surprisingly nice places to get lunch - lighter fare (well, maybe not at the Pizza stand) and a more personal feel. We enjoyed the cafes both in Eden and in the Solarium on multiple days.

‚Äî The premium dining was indeed premium and with prices to match. Enjoyed Le Petit Chef and Fine Cut (but once is enough for each). Cancelled a reservation at Raw on 5 after looking at the menu and prices; we love our seafood but can get fine meals at home for a lot less $$. 

‚Äî Bar and coffee lines tended to be long everywhere all the time. 

‚Äî Last day at sea is when the best buffet food comes out -  do the premium dining mid-cruise

‚Äî We‚Äôre soda and water addicts and had no trouble bringing onboard a carry-on full of sodas and water that lasted us the whole trip. Very little room in the stateroom fridge, though - two bottles at a time.

I‚Äôm based in California. I work a steady job that keeps me busy, but in my downtime, I‚Äôm all about the little things that bring me peace. I love music (I‚Äôm always looking for new playlists), getting lost in a good book, and watching anime to unwind. Coffee is my go-to comfort, whether it‚Äôs a quiet morning cup or a late-night conversation over a fresh brew. Lately, I‚Äôve also found a lot of joy in gardening ‚Äî there‚Äôs something calming about taking care of plants and watching things grow.

What I‚Äôm looking for is simple: genuine connection. Someone who wants to talk about life, passions, dreams, and even the random little things that make us who we are. Whether it‚Äôs deep conversations or lighthearted banter, I‚Äôm here for both. Romance isn‚Äôt necessarily the goal, but if something more grows from a connection, I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed.

If any of this resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Let‚Äôs see if we can make this disconnected world feel a little smaller.

So, the situation is myself (36M) and my wife (31F) have beet together for 17 years, first relationhip for both. Have an amazing toddler, and expecting another one soon. Both work, financially solid.

My wife is a great partner, very reliable and supportive in many things. But she has inherited two horrible pattern from her mother - refuses to communicate and just fades put for the topics she doesn't like and doesn't respect things which are impportant for me. Some time ago she went to my PC and changed my password for paying bills etc. on a platform, which pissed me off as I do it always, while she didn't care that it causes me a lot of inconvenience. Ended up arguing about and she stated ""you are a man, so you cant have feelings besides anger"". And something just died inside me. I really stopped feeling anything to her. Its been around 3 month now. My memory keeps raising every moment of analogous behaviour and her attitude to me and I realise it was constant, while I was more focused on the fact we are together and its just good that we are a stable couple. Recently she admitted that.

Today she told she feels distance from me (not a surpise I guess), tells that she is concerned, started therapy. She told she wants to fix what she did, while she cant give me back the years of such neglect. I feel misery 90% of time. Like she became my neighbour. When I stay alone with my thoughts, I just exist, not live. I feel I have wasted my life and years with wrong woman, ignoring my feelings and trying to cope or refocus on other things. 

Now I feel desperate. I want to love and be valued, I want to be seen as a human with emotions. I started to spend more time at work and trying to escape elsewhere, including reading different family situations in reddit. I just dont feel like I want to communicate with my wife or put any effort to fix relationship with her. I have a colleague at work who tells about her life and relationship and I just daydream about having a talk over a coffee with her, like I try to escape from my thoughts and from the reality I live in. Its painful.

I dont know what is happening with me and what can be done. So bad falling out of love could be fixed? Or my marriage is dead?

Sorry for typos and bad sentence structure, I am not native in english and my emotions literally make my fingers shake.

TL;DR wife doesnt believe men could have emotions, I lost all the feelings for her and feel like she is a stranger for me.",1,1736874153.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

The room is long, but not very wide, especially with how the front door opens. We are looking for suggestions on what people think would be a good couch/sectional layout(actual couch suggestions would be big help). We have been searching near and far for sectionals and have found very few that wouldn't interfere with the front door opening/are just too close to the door opening. It would just have to be a little smaller of a sectional. We have also looked into a sofa on the wall that is 146 inches and putting a chair and a half across from it, but that leaves little room for a coffee table depending on the depth of the sofa and chair and feels cluttered/awkward. The TV is going to be mounted above the fireplace so that is why I would rather a sectional, but my wife likes the sofa and chair and a half. The layout with couches is very rough estimate and all the dimensions on the drawing are in inches. Thank you!

Previously, the decision was between a KA and Bosch (being connected to the company). The most important characteristic I was looking for was the temp of milk based drinks. After a lot of researching and watching hours of videos, I was convinced that neither the KA nor the Bosch would produce hot enough drinks. To my delight, the De'Longhi produces GREAT drinks with the perfect drinking temperature. The lattes come out at a steaming 170 F or so. The milk temp is dispensed in the 140s range, but the hot coffee extraction raises the overall temp of the drink. Macchiatos and cappuccinos are cooler (final temps in the 150 range). The more froth, the warmer the drink in those drink styles.

I bought my machine at a Williams Sonomo store where I was able to compare extracted drinks from De'Longhi, Miele and Jura. The Juras just seemed fiddly, and quite a bit more expensive. The store honored the Amazon sale price of around $1400 (prices have jumped since then).

For those looking and still on the fence, I think the Eletta is a great option if you like milk based drinks. The connected app allows for better control of how much milk and coffee dispensing is done.

It's called Lost and Found.,"The jungle was alive with sound: the high-pitched drone of insects, the guttural calls of unseen animals, the distant rush of water cascading over rocks. To Elias it was all just noise, a wall of sound pressing in from every direction. He kept moving, machete in hand, hacking his way through the dense undergrowth. The air was thick and humid, clinging to his skin like a second layer.

‚ÄúShould‚Äôve said no,‚Äù Elias muttered to himself. His voice sounded flat, swallowed by the jungle before it could carry more than a few feet. ‚ÄúShould‚Äôve stayed in the city. Let someone else chase after dead men.‚Äù

The contract had been too good to pass up: a missing research team, deep in the jungle, last seen poking around a stretch of land no one had mapped yet. Their employer, some corporate bigwig with more money than sense, was desperate to find out what had happened. They‚Äôd offered Elias a small fortune to track the team down. Alive or dead, they‚Äôd said. He didn‚Äôt ask why. The money was enough.

Now, as he trudged through miles of unmarked jungle with no clear sign of his targets, he regretted it. Not because he cared about the team, they‚Äôd probably gotten themselves killed doing something stupid, but because the job was turning into a grind.

The first camp he found was picked clean. Tents collapsed, supplies scattered. He spotted a half-empty box of medical equipment, its contents spoiled by the damp. A map lay crumpled near the fire pit, so warped from the moisture that it was illegible. There were no signs of a struggle, no blood, no tracks leading away. Just silence.

He stood there for a moment, chewing on the end of a cigarette he‚Äôd forgotten to light. ‚ÄúAmateurs,‚Äù he muttered. He picked up the map, shook his head, and tossed it aside.

The days blurred together as Elias pushed deeper into the wilderness. The landmarks marked on his GPS became increasingly unreliable; rivers appeared where they shouldn‚Äôt, cliffs loomed out of nowhere. He tried to make sense of the terrain, but it felt like the jungle was shifting around him.

Nights were the worst.

He slept lightly, his hand always on the grip of his pistol, but the jungle never slept. The sounds of the day were replaced by something sharper, more insistent: rustling leaves, snapping branches, the faint splash of something moving through the water. He told himself it was just animals. Jaguars, monkeys, the usual jungle fauna, but it never stopped putting him on edge.

By the fifth day, the isolation began to wear on him. He talked to himself more often, swearing at the heat, cursing the team for dragging him into this mess. He tried to radio his employer once, but the signal was gone, nothing but static.

‚ÄúFigures,‚Äù he muttered, jamming the radio back into his pack. ‚ÄúMiddle of nowhere, no backup, no comms. Hell of a way to make a living.‚Äù

They found him on the seventh day.

It was just before dawn, the faint glow of morning barely visible through the canopy. Elias had set up a small camp near a river, boiling water for coffee over a sputtering fire. He was staring at the flames, trying to shake off the stiffness in his legs, when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye.

He turned sharply, hand on his pistol, but it was too late.

They came from the trees. Silent, painted figures emerging from the shadows like wraiths. Their bodies were slick with mud and ash, their faces obscured by grotesque masks made of bone and feathers. Elias barely had time to draw his weapon before they were on him, their hands grabbing his arms, his legs, his throat.

‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù he snarled, struggling against their grip, but they were relentless. He kicked out, catching one of them in the chest, but another took his place. Something hard struck the back of his head, and the world went dark.

When Elias woke, his hands were bound, his head pounding like a drum. He blinked against the harsh sunlight, his vision swimming, and realized he was being carried.

The village was like nothing he‚Äôd ever seen. Small huts made of wood and thatch were clustered around a central clearing, where a group of villagers stood waiting. They were silent, their faces painted in the same bone-white patterns as the ones who‚Äôd captured him.

Elias was dropped onto the ground with a grunt. He rolled onto his side, spitting out dirt, and looked up at the circle of villagers surrounding him. They didn‚Äôt move. They just stared, their dark eyes unblinking.

‚ÄúThe hell do you want?‚Äù he growled, his voice raw.

They didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, one of them, a tall figure wearing a mask adorned with feathers and teeth, stepped forward. The others parted to let him through, bowing their heads as he passed.

The tall figure knelt before Elias, tilting his head as if studying him. Then, without a word, he reached out and smeared something across Elias‚Äôs forehead. It was cold and sticky, and the smell of it made Elias gag. Blood, he realized. Fresh blood.

Before he could say anything, the villagers began to chant.

Elias‚Äôs head swam as the chanting rose around him, a low, guttural rhythm that seemed to reverberate in his chest. He couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but their cadence was hypnotic, pulling him into a state somewhere between rage and stupor.

The tall figure, still kneeling before him, reached out and pressed a hand against Elias‚Äôs forehead. His fingers were rough and calloused, the pressure steady and unyielding. Elias tried to jerk away, but the man‚Äôs strength was unnatural, his grip like iron.

The chanting grew louder.

Elias‚Äôs vision blurred, the edges of the villagers‚Äô forms blending with the surrounding jungle. It was as if the world itself was dissolving, becoming less real. The tall figure whispered something soft, rhythmic, and incomprehensible. The words crawled into Elias‚Äôs mind, slithering into the cracks of his consciousness like worms.

He closed his eyes, trying to block it all out, but the whispers followed him into the darkness.

Elias didn‚Äôt remember being moved.
When he opened his eyes again, he was lying on cold, damp stone. The air was thick, heavy with the scent of mildew and something sharper, metallic, almost sweet. He pushed himself up on shaky arms, his wrists still bound, and looked around.

The cavern was immense, its walls glistening with moisture and streaked with veins of black and red. Bioluminescent fungi clung to the rocks, casting an eerie green glow that barely pierced the shadows. In the center of the chamber was a pit, its edges jagged and uneven, descending into absolute darkness.

The villagers were there, standing in a semicircle around the pit. They were silent now, their faces tilted upward as if waiting for something. The tall figure stood at the edge of the pit, his back to Elias, holding a crude, bloodstained knife.

Elias groaned, the sound echoing faintly in the cavern. His head throbbed, his body weak. He tried to rise, but his legs buckled beneath him, sending him sprawling back to the cold stone.

The tall figure turned at the noise, his mask catching the faint green light. Without a word, he gestured to two villagers, who approached Elias and hauled him to his feet.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Elias rasped, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you people doing?‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt answer.

Elias was dragged to the edge of the pit, where the air grew colder, denser. The metallic scent was stronger here, mingling with a faint, sickly-sweet aroma that made his stomach churn.

The tall figure began to chant again, the same guttural rhythm as before. The villagers joined in, their voices blending into a single, droning harmony.

Elias looked down into the pit and froze.

At first, he thought it was empty. A void so deep that no light could reach its bottom. But then he saw it: movement. Slow, deliberate, and immense. Layers of something shifted in the darkness, their surfaces glistening like oil on water. A limb, if it could be called that, emerged briefly, its form too alien to describe, before melting back into the mass.

Elias‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. The thing below wasn‚Äôt just moving, it was alive.

The chanting grew louder.

The villagers began to sway, their movements synchronized as though guided by an unseen force. The tall figure raised his knife, its blade catching the faint light, and began to carve something into his own forearm.

Elias‚Äôs knees buckled, and he would have fallen had the villagers not held him upright. The thing in the pit shifted again, and for a moment, Elias thought he saw faces, hundreds of them, all emerging from its surface. They stared up at him, their mouths open in silent screams, before dissolving back into the writhing mass.

Something brushed against his mind.

It wasn‚Äôt a voice, not exactly. It was an odd sensation. A low, rumbling vibration that resonated deep within his skull. Images flashed behind his eyes: alien landscapes, vast and empty; stars winking out one by one; a yawning void that stretched endlessly into the dark.

He screamed, but no sound came out.

The knife came down, not on Elias, but on the villager to his right. The man crumpled to the ground, his blood pooling at the edge of the pit. The chanting stopped abruptly, replaced by a deafening silence.

Elias felt it then, the presence in the pit. It wasn‚Äôt looking at him, not in the way a person looks, but he could feel its attention. Its awareness pressed against him, vast and overwhelming, crushing his thoughts beneath its weight.

His vision blurred. The cavern twisted and warped around him, the walls seeming to breathe, the floor buckling beneath his feet.

Elias began to laugh. It started as a low chuckle, but it grew, building into a manic cackle that echoed through the chamber. The villagers stared at him, their expressions unreadable beneath their masks.

He fell to his knees, still laughing, tears streaming down his face.

The tall figure stepped forward, his head tilting as he observed Elias. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he pushed Elias toward the pit.

Elias didn‚Äôt resist.

As he fell, the last thing he saw was the thing below, its shifting layers spreading open to greet him.

The jungle was quiet when the rescue team arrived, unnaturally so. There were no bird calls, no insect drone, only the crunch of boots on damp earth and the faint rustle of leaves in the humid air.

Captain Merrick led the group, his machete carving a path through the dense undergrowth. Behind him, his team moved cautiously, their rifles held at the ready. They were mercenaries, hired by the same corporation that had sent Elias Vorn into the jungle weeks ago. Their job was simple: find Elias, find the missing research team, and report back.

But something about the mission felt off. The silence, the oppressive heat, the way the jungle seemed to close in around them‚Äîit was like stepping into another world.

‚ÄúThis place gives me the creeps,‚Äù muttered Daniels, the youngest member of the team. He swiped at a bead of sweat trickling down his temple.

‚ÄúFocus,‚Äù Merrick snapped. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to sightsee.‚Äù

The trail wasn‚Äôt hard to follow. They found the first signs of Elias two days in: scraps of his gear scattered along the forest floor. A broken compass. A torn satchel. Then came the blood.

The first patch was small, just a smear on a rock, but as they went deeper, the signs became more disturbing. Strips of skin hung from branches like grotesque decorations, their edges ragged as if torn off in a frenzy. Pieces of clothing, soaked in blood, were draped over roots and rocks.

Daniels gagged as they passed a severed finger lying in the mud, its nail cracked and blackened. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened here?‚Äù he whispered.

Merrick didn‚Äôt answer. He kept moving, his jaw tight, his eyes scanning the shadows.

They found the first body on the third day.

It was one of the research team, or what was left of him. His corpse was splayed across the ground, his limbs bent at unnatural angles. His face was frozen in a mask of terror, his eyes wide and unseeing. Carved into his chest were strange, angular symbols that seemed to shimmer in the faint light filtering through the canopy.

Daniels stumbled back, bile rising in his throat. ‚ÄúJesus Christ...‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep it together,‚Äù Merrick barked, though his own voice wavered.

The trail grew worse from there. More bodies, more pieces. Fingers, an ear, an entire scalp nailed to a tree. Each piece was a breadcrumb leading them closer to something they couldn‚Äôt understand.

By the fifth day, the team was falling apart. Daniels refused to eat, his hands trembling so badly he could barely hold his rifle. One of the others, Carter, started mumbling to himself, his eyes darting nervously at every shadow.

It wasn‚Äôt just the bodies. The jungle itself felt wrong. The air grew heavier, thicker, making it hard to breathe. The trees seemed to lean closer, their branches twisting into shapes that looked almost human.

It was then that they found him.

He was sitting in a clearing, his back to a massive tree, his head tilted upward as if staring at something only he could see. His body was mangled with strips of skin missing, his hands raw and bloody, his fingernails torn off. One of his eyes was gone, the socket dark and sunken.

The remaining eye rolled toward them as they approached.

He stared in silence.

Merrick stepped closer, his rifle trained on the man. ‚ÄúElias Vorn?‚Äù

The response was continued silence and an unbroken stare.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the team?‚Äù Merrick demanded.

Nothing.

‚ÄúWhere are they Elias!?!‚Äù Merrick pressed, his voice rising.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he began to hum‚Äîa low, tuneless drone that set Merrick‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù Daniels whispered, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúWe need to leave.‚Äù

Merrick hesitated. He wanted answers, but something in Elias‚Äôs eye told him the man was beyond saving.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking you out of here,‚Äù he said finally, lowering his rifle.

The humming continued.

‚ÄúContact base. Tell them we found the bounty hunter but no team.‚Äù Merrick ordered.

Elias began to scream‚Äîa raw, guttural sound that echoed through the clearing.

His shrieking silenced the surrounding ambience of the jungle.

The team dragged Elias out of the clearing, his screams echoing behind them. They didn‚Äôt look back, didn‚Äôt stop until they were miles away.

But the jungle followed them. The air grew heavier, the shadows darker. Whispers began to creep into their minds, voices that weren‚Äôt their own. By the time they reached the extraction point, half the team was dead‚Äîlost to the jungle or to themselves.

Elias was silent when they boarded the helicopter, his body limp, his eye fixed on something far beyond the horizon.

Merrick sat beside him, staring out the window as the jungle disappeared beneath them. But even as they rose higher, he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they hadn‚Äôt escaped.

In the corner of his vision, he saw Elias‚Äôs lips move, forming the same words over and over.",11,1736874039.0,Lovecraft,0,1.0,False

Common Misconceptions About DXN Marketing Sdn Bhd's Business Practices
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the landscape of network marketing, misunderstandings can often cloud the perceptions of potential members and customers. When it comes to **DXN Marketing Sdn Bhd**, several common misconceptions circulate that can mislead individuals about their business practices. Understanding these myths is crucial for anyone considering joining or engaging with DXN.

### The Misunderstanding of MLM as a Pyramid Scheme

One of the most pervasive misconceptions about DXN is that it operates like a pyramid scheme. This belief often arises from a lack of understanding about how multi-level marketing (MLM) works. Unlike pyramid schemes, where profits are primarily generated from recruiting others rather than selling products, DXN focuses on product sales. Members earn commissions through the sale of actual products and can also receive bonuses for recruiting, but the emphasis remains on retail sales.

### Quality of Products

Another common myth is that the quality of DXN‚Äôs products is subpar. Many people dismiss MLM products without trying them, assuming they cannot compete with mainstream brands. In reality, DXN offers a wide range of health and wellness products, including supplements made from natural ingredients, that have received positive reviews and testimonials from users. Their rigorous quality control measures ensure that every product meets high standards.

### The Belief That It‚Äôs Easy Money

Many newcomers think that joining DXN will result in quick and easy income. While the potential for earnings exists, it is essential to recognize that success often requires time, effort, and dedication. Like any business, it involves building a network, marketing products, and developing good relationships with both customers and fellow members. Realistic expectations are crucial for long-term success.

### Perceived Lack of Support

Some individuals believe that joining DXN means they will be on their own without support. This misconception overlooks the extensive training and resources DXN provides for its members. From mentorship programs to marketing materials, DXN aims to equip its members with the necessary tools to thrive. Engaging with a community of like-minded individuals also fosters collaboration and shared success.

### Belief That Only Top Leaders Succeed

A frequent notion is that only the top members of DXN see significant financial returns. While top leaders do benefit from their experience and extensive networks, this does not mean that others cannot succeed. Numerous case studies exist of average members who have built successful businesses through hard work and consistent effort. DXN rewards progress at every level, allowing various earning potentials based on dedication and strategy.

### High Start-Up Costs

Potential members often worry about the financial investment required to start with DXN. While some network marketing companies demand high start-up costs, this is not the case with DXN. The initial investment is relatively low, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to join without fear of significant financial risk. This accessibility is one of the critical factors that make DXN an attractive option for many.

### Misconceptions About Market Saturation

Another common myth is that the market for DXN products is saturated, making it difficult for new members to break in. While certain regions may have established members, the demand for health products continues to grow. Different countries and demographics provide a wealth of untapped markets. Moreover, as consumer preferences shift toward natural and wellness products, opportunities for new members remain plentiful.

### Inflexibility of Business Model

Many perceive MLMs as rigid in their practices and progression. However, DXN encourages members to tailor their strategies and work in a manner that suits their individual strengths. Whether a member wants to focus on local sales or build a global network, DXN supports versatile approaches to marketing and sales. This flexibility can be a significant advantage, enabling members to operate in a way that best fits their lifestyle.

By addressing these common misconceptions about DXN Marketing Sdn Bhd, you can gain clearer insights into what the company represents and how its business practices function. Armed with accurate information, you can make informed decisions about engaging with this unique marketing opportunity.

The room is long, but not very wide, especially with how the front door opens. We are looking for suggestions on what people think would be a good couch/sectional layout(actual couch suggestions would be big help). We have been searching near and far for sectionals and have found very few that wouldn't interfere with the front door opening/are just too close to the door opening. It would just have to be a little smaller of a sectional. We have also looked into a sofa on the wall that is 146 inches and putting a chair and a half across from it, but that leaves little room for a coffee table depending on the depth of the sofa and chair and feels cluttered/awkward. The TV is going to be mounted above the fireplace so that is why I would rather a sectional, but my wife likes the sofa and chair and a half. The layout with couches is very rough estimate and all the dimensions on the drawing are in inches. Thank you!

Short background: I'm a Muslim American of Pakistani origin and I lived through the post 9-11 discrimination from collage to adult life. I felt it all change after Obama (locally) and decided to have a family and settle down in the US only to get Trump in my first election cycle as new citizen. During and after the Iraq war I knew of several cases where people were put into political prisons for having an opinion on the matter. With the change in the general conscious I felt people realized how racist and wrong ""going to a random country and murdering millions of people"" is. But what changed the situation for the rest of the Muslims was how the public now perceived muslims. Prior to that it was ""shut up and keep your head down"" and I didn't want my kids to grow up in that.

My first amazing sighting of humanity was when so many people stood up against the Muslim ban. It was heartwarming and I would  go up to the ACLU people whenever I saw them at O'Hare and get them coffee and breakfast for what they were doing. 

I think this conflict kind of broke me. Because I was used to being able to have somewhat of a voice. Especially because (at least from a legislative perspective) it seems like we're headed backwards. As a Muslim I find myself creating risk for my family by having a voice. I'm 80% sure I got let go from my last job  of 8 years because my ex boss (ex-IDF) did not like my activism on LinkedIn.

Bottom line though, I sincerely appreciate each and every one of you (my Jewish brothers and sisters) for having a voice and opinion about what's going on. I feel my only voice as a result of piggybacking on your voice and it's accepted validity. I am eternally thankful and grateful for you going through the angst of separating from the mainstream, because it allows me and avenue to live the truth and not conform (bow down) to majority narrative to avoid risk.

TLDR: lived the life of constant denial. Thankful for all my Jewish brothers and sisters voicing up and standing against the mainstream.",19,1736873873.0,JewsOfConscience,2,1.0,False

Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other



October 21st, 1993 - Santa Fe, NM



The Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe. A bastion of normalcy amidst the swirling chaos of I've been subjected to. Or so one would hope. I took up a booth with a clear view of the entrance, ostensibly to observe any‚Ä¶ fluctuations. Truthfully, it was to maintain an edge against the gnawing anxiety that had taken root since Siouxsie's (Like ""And The Banshees"", apparently. I been spelling it ""Suzie"" this entire time) frantic call to my show and her equally urgent followups on random payphones. I was still bewildered at how she managed to catch me when I was near them.



I nursed a lukewarm coffee, the taste not entirely dissimilar to burnt plastic, and observed the midday crowd. Tourists mostly, decked out in ludicrous amounts of turquoise. The kind that make locals roll their eyes. Then, my gaze landed on a figure hunched over a mountain of waffles and a truly alarming quantity of crisp bacon. Small frame, completely swallowed by an oversized black hoodie. One might have mistaken it for a child, demolishing a breakfast that would give even the most ardent lumberjack pause.



I waited. Siouxsie was due any minute. This‚Ä¶ child, though, was certainly making a statement. The way the tiny, fabric-covered hands expertly maneuvered a forkful of syrup-drenched waffle into the unseen maw beneath the hood was almost hypnotic. I found myself wondering if this was some new, remarkably efficient method of resource depletion I hadn't encountered. Perhaps a juvenile cryptid with an insatiable sweet tooth? The sheer volume was‚Ä¶ noteworthy.



A cough broke my reverie. A tall woman with tired eyes and a no-nonsense aura stood beside the booth. Dr. Eliza Vance. I straightened, a mild surprise flickering behind my spectacles. Before I could formulate a greeting, a small, fabric-draped hand tugged at Vance‚Äôs sleeve. The hooded figure from the counter.



‚ÄúCount Jim?‚Äù a muffled voice emanated from beneath the black fabric. ‚ÄúTook you long enough. Though you‚Äôre be easy to spot in your getup.‚Äù



My gaze narrowed. The voice was undeniably Siouxsie‚Äôs, albeit slightly distorted by the layers of fabric. I confess, a flicker of‚Ä¶ bewilderment crossed my stoic facade. ‚ÄúSiouxsie?‚Äù I inquired, my voice measured.



This was a turn. I was half expecting Vance to be this mysterious nerve-wracked voice on the phone that's been haunting me. Not this... munchkin.



The hoodie bobbed. ‚ÄúSurprise! Turns out, hitchhiking with a former NAORC scientist is faster than waiting for you to drive all the way from Sisterfuckersville.‚Äù



Former NAORC scientist. Things just keep getting better.



Vance offered a wry smile. ‚ÄúIt's a long drive from Thurber, Siouxsie. Though I admit, the full ‚ÄòCount Jim‚Äô regalia is‚Ä¶ striking in broad daylight.‚Äù



‚ÄúRight?‚Äù the muffled voice agreed. ‚ÄúLike he just stepped off the set of some low-budget vampire Western. You only wear that for the show, right? Please tell me you don‚Äôt grocery shop like this.‚Äù



My hand instinctively went to the brim of my hat. ‚ÄúHey, my outfit is stylish and‚Ä¶ functional. And it serves as a‚Ä¶ recognizable symbol.‚Äù



Siouxsie snorted, a surprisingly loud sound considering her size. ‚ÄúYeah, a symbol of ‚Äòplease ask me about my cable access show.‚Äô‚Äù



‚ÄúAlright, you two,‚Äù Vance interjected, a hint of amusement in her tone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs focus. We have a lot to discuss.‚Äù She slid into the booth opposite me, and with a final, triumphant scrape of a fork against ceramic, Siouxsie, still shrouded in the hoodie, settled beside her.



Vance leaned forward, her expression serious. ‚ÄúSiouxsie is a good acquaintence of mine. She figured you could use my help. I have information, disturbing information, about the NAORC. And about a project they‚Äôre running in collaboration with‚Ä¶ your associates.‚Äù



My jaw tightened. ‚ÄúYes. The EOTO. The NAORC is placing nice with us for the time being.‚Äù



‚ÄúSpecifically,‚Äù Vance continued, her voice dropping, ‚ÄúBoth organizations keeping tabs on the Waxahachie particle accelerator. The guys in charge there are not just smashing atoms, Jim. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ attempting something far more ambitious. Something involving temporal manipulation. And according to Siouxsie, it‚Äôs not going well.‚Äù



Siouxsie shifted, the fabric of her sleeves rustling. ‚ÄúNot going well is an understatement.  Think‚Ä¶ messing with things that should not be messed with. And guess who‚Äôs right in the middle of it?‚Äù



The weight of her words settled heavily in the air. The burnt plastic taste of the coffee seemed to intensify.



Suddenly, the bell above the diner door chimed, announcing new arrivals. Two men, both broad-shouldered and possessing that unsettlingly vacant gaze I‚Äôd become familiar with in my tenure with the EOTO. NAORC operatives.



‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù I stated, my voice low.



Siouxsie stiffened beside me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ looking for someone small. And probably someone who smells faintly of waffle batter.‚Äù



‚ÄúTime to go,‚Äù Vance said, already sliding out of the booth.



As I rose, I felt a tug on my coat. Siouxsie. ‚ÄúHold tight,‚Äù she whispered, her voice no longer muffled.



Before I could react, she moved. A blur of black fabric, faster than anything I could have anticipated. One moment she was beside me, the next she was halfway to the exit, weaving through tables with an impossible agility. The pursuing men, momentarily stunned by her speed, stumbled over a discarded tray.



And then, something truly remarkable happened. As she reached the door, a ripple seemed to distort the air around her. For a split second, she wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ there. More like a flicker on a faulty television screen. Then she was gone, the door swinging shut behind her.



Vance and I exchanged a look. Even through my red-tinted lenses, I could see the shock mirrored in her eyes. Something was undeniably‚Ä¶ different about Siouxsie.



We made our escape through the back exit, less dramatically but no less urgently. Siouxsie was already waiting in the alley, leaning against a dumpster, the oversized hoodie still concealing her features.



‚ÄúShow off,‚Äù I muttered, though a grudging respect was beginning to form.



‚ÄúHad to make an impression,‚Äù she replied, a hint of that sly wit I‚Äôd heard in her voice earlier. A far cry from her tense anxious pleas over the phone.



A decommissioned NAORC facility outside of Los Alamos became our next destination. Maybe we could find something of use there. Vance worked there in the past and knew its layout; Siouxsie possessed‚Ä¶ abilities of some sort apparantely. And I, well, I had... vague... experience with the unpleasant things NAORC liked to keep hidden.



But that can wait till tomorrow. I was overdue for a nap and a shower. We headed to the crappy motel I booked.



Later, while Siouxsie was boredly flipping throught he channels on the motel TV while demolishing an entire pizza, Vance was out getting supplies, and I was sound asleep in a chair, the satellite link on my laptop pinged and woke me up from my slumber. A text message from an anonymous Count Jim BBS user. The words were simple, chillingly so: \[The Red Inquisitioner knows\]. Inquisitor. It has to be the scary dude in the pointy hood.

Okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but seriously, how do they do it? Mornings can be tough, and if you're anything like me, that snooze button is way more persuasive than your boss could ever be. But, let's face it‚Äîthat extra ten minutes in bed rarely makes life any easier, right?

Here‚Äôs a little secret I‚Äôve stumbled upon: *a morning routine that actually sets you up for success* doesn‚Äôt have to be as mythical as the Loch Ness monster. ü¶ï

**What‚Äôs the trick, you ask?** It‚Äôs about tiny habits that build up like a game of Jenga, but, you know, without the anxiety of everything collapsing!

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what‚Äôs been working for me:  

- **Wake up 15 minutes early.** Yes, I know, wild start. But honestly, those 15 minutes can feel like a game-changer. Imagine the luxury of sipping coffee with both eyes open. ‚òï

- **Hydrate your brain.** A glass of water first thing. It‚Äôs like giving your body a tiny splash of ‚Äúyou got this!‚Äù every morning.

- **A quick workout, no sweat (literally).** 10 push-ups or a brisk walk with your pet can get those neurons firing. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüêï

- **Eat something light but energizing.** Think fruit, a smoothie, or maybe just a spoonful of peanut butter. Whatever makes you feel like you're refueling the *Batmobile*.

- **Set ONE goal for the day.** Big or small, just one thing you‚Äôd be proud to check off. There‚Äôs something ridiculously satisfying about knowing you nailed a target.

- **Music or meditation?** Either start with a track that makes you feel on top of the world or try a two-minute meditation app. Pick your mood booster.

- **Ready, set‚Ä¶ pause?** Take one minute to just breathe and picture your day ahead‚Äînot sweating it, just a gentle visualization of absolutely crushing it. Then, go!

It doesn‚Äôt always go to plan (hello, life?), but with a little consistency, these small steps add up to something pretty powerful. Cheers to the journey of mastering mornings without feeling like a grizzly bear woken early from hibernation! üêª

I‚Äôd love to hear what morning tweaks have helped you take on the day with an extra bounce. And hey, if this inspires you even a little, high five over the internet. ‚úã Let‚Äôs keep this going.",1,1736873649.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking to buy a Jura coffee machine. I don‚Äôt want to spend too much, so I decided to go with a used one.

My parents have had an E60 for 7 years, and I really like it. It‚Äôs not fancy, but it does a very good job with basic coffees. What‚Äôs most important to me is that it works flawlessly ‚Äî not even one malfunction (even though we have water with a lot of calcium in our area; we do filter it, of course).

I started looking for a used Jura for my household. I was considering the A7, but I realized that I would prefer something that makes stronger coffee (my grandparents have an A7), and I actually have enough room for a larger machine. So, I began looking at the E6/E60 or E8/80. I found an E6 with 4.5k cups on it. However, there is also a good deal for a WE8 with 21k cups in my area. I know the WE8 is designed for more professional use, so maybe it's nothing for it to handle? I would love more coffee options, but as I said, durability is the most important factor for me.

They were malnourished and had a radical diet change from random human food like (oatmeal and yoghurt) to cat food. I feed them Prima Cat Kitten wet food and kibbles. Vet said not to free feed them and told me to ""cut"" their food with boiled chicken to make it less fatty because they had diarrhea in the beginning and this one still has it quite often.

The vet is otherwise amazing and the best one in town but I have a feeling they're projecting a bit about the diarrhea because they told me that they have IBS and fatty food makes it worse. But does it really work like that on cats? 

I've thought that you cannot over feed kittens and I want them to get used to the fact that enough food will come regularly because when they first came here, they would tear my hands and arms when I held a package of food and I had to call emergency clinic too many times because they had eaten for example mandarin or drank coffee etc :') I still have to feed my dog in the bathroom because otherwise they will eat his food (he will let them if they try, he's very beta) but they've calmed down a lot and even sometimes leave leftovers. 

His brother is a bit smaller than him but they are big kittens, this guy is already way bigger than my partner's adult cats. I've seen their father and he's a large cat too.

So I‚Äôve been on dating apps for a while now, and I wanted to share something that rreally helped me improve my profile.  

For a long time, I just had random photos on there‚Äîlike selfeis, group pics, whatever I had on my phone. And I wasn‚Äôt geting much attention. So I figured, ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get some professional photos done. That‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù  

I booked this expensive photoshoot, got all dressed up, did the whole thing. The photos were super high-quality, edited perfecty‚Ä¶ but when I uploaded them? Nada. Barely any improvement in likes or matches.  

Honestly, I think those pics made me look too polished or serious. Like, I don‚Äôt know, too professional? People on dating apps wanna see the real you, not some stif version of yourself.  

So I decieded to try something different. I found a beginner photographer and asked her to shoot pics with her iPhone. We went to random spots around town‚Äîa park, a coffee shop, even a random wall with cool graffiti. The photos looked way more natural and relaxed.  

After uploading those new pics, my matches went way up. I actually started geting messages, and people were commenting on how friendly and down-to-earth I looked.  

Moral of the story? Sometimes, it‚Äôs not about having the perfect photo. It‚Äôs about looking like you. Skip the polished headshots and go for something natural.

For a long time, I just uploaded random pics I already had on my phone. Selfies, group pics, a couple from a wedding‚Ä¶ you know the drill. And honestly, it wasn‚Äôt really working. Barely any likes.

Then I thought, *‚ÄúOkay, maybe I need some pro photos to look more serious or whatever.‚Äù* So I booked a proper photoshoot with this fancy photographer. The photos turned out amazing‚Äîsuper high quality, perfect lighting, edited nicely. I thought I was set.

I uploaded them to Bumble, expecting a flood of likes. And‚Ä¶ nothing. If anything, I think I got *less* attention. People weren‚Äôt really swiping right, and I even felt like those pics made me look a bit too *stiff* or fake.

That‚Äôs when I decided to switch it up. I reached out to a beginner photographer (who was actually just a friend of a friend), and I asked her to take pics on her *iPhone*, not her pro Canon. We picked some random spots around town‚Äîlike a park, a coffee shop, even a cool graffiti wall‚Äîand she just snapped some more natural-looking pics.

And wow. The difference was HUGE. After uploading those pics, I started getting way more likes and matches. People even commented that I looked friendly and approachable. The pro photos? They made me look like I was trying too hard.

So yeah, if you‚Äôre thinking of updating your profile pics, maybe skip the whole professional photoshoot thing. Instead, try some casual photos that actually show *you*. It worked for me!

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Would love to hear your thoughts!",51,1736872693.0,Bumble,12,0.95,False

For those that didn‚Äôt realize, the Moon moves east against the sky, even as the sky moves west, meaning it stays up slightly longer than 12 hours. So I while I was getting coffee I was roughly calculating the time the Moon would stay up. Orbits are about 30 days, so each day it does about 360/30 = 12 degrees of movement eastward. My viewing times were almost exactly 12 hours apart, so that‚Äôs 12/2 = 6 degrees of change during that time. An hour is 360/24 = 15 degrees of change. 6/15 * 60 is about 25 minutes.

On our first date, we met for coffee, he took me for dinner and wanted the date to continue. I set a boundary and said I needed to leave. It was a good first date but I was surprised he wanted to spend the whole night with me at three different places. He paid for everything.

He called me nightly. Sent good morning texts, lots of selfies, etc. I typically don‚Äôt see behavior like this from men until after a few dates when we have really made a connection. 

He invited me for a 2nd date to go to a concert with friends. I told him I want to meet his friends eventually, but I want to go on more 1:1 dates with just him. We didn‚Äôt go to the concert but based on scheduling, the next time I‚Äôd be able to see him he has plans for a party with friends, and I wanted to see him so I went. It was a lot of socializing with new people, but it was fun and he made me feel comfortable.

Date 3 - he took me out to a nice dinner. Really nice. Champagne and frois gras type place. He paid. It was an amazing night. 

Date 4- he went to my place for the first time. He brought flowers, we made out, we had wine, he could only stay for 2 hours. We did not have sex.

Darte 5 - his Dad was in town and I wanted to see him before he left for over a month for the holidays. I thought it was really early to meet his dad, and I still wanted more dates alone with him, but due to time constraints I decided to go and meet his dad. I went to his place for the first time, then we went out with his dad. His dad was nice, it was fun, but it was a lot for me to see his place and meet his dad for the first time both at once, and so soon. 

He then left for the holidays. He scheduled a date with me for when he returned. He messaged me every day. We had phone calls. He sent me a Xmas gift. He told me he missed me. I was excited to see him when he got back. He asked to be exclusive, but I thought it was too early. I wanted to wait until I had more 1:1 time with him.

Yesterday, around 11am he said he wanted to chat. My gut sank. I wanted to talk to him right away but we scheduled a time in the evening. The suspense bothered me all day at work. Thirty minutes before our scheduled time he told me he couldn‚Äôt call because work was too busy. He did not offer a new time. I told him that the vibes I am getting is that he doesn‚Äôt want to move forward with me and that I would like to know as soon as possible instead of leaving me hanging with suspense. 

An hour or so later I received a long text from him saying he had some reflections and I did something about a week ago that really bothered him during a phone call and wanted to end it. 

I am shocked. I had no idea I hurt him during the phone call, and if I did, I would have liked to discuss it with him vs. him just giving up on the relationship. 

I don‚Äôt understand how someone could pursue me with such force and then end it so abruptly over a text without a discussion on my point of view on what bothered him. 

I feel like he either liked the chase and wanted to end it once I started to fall for him, or there was something else that made him want to break up. I think his current explanation is an excuse. 

I feel like he never had a chance to really get to know me and therefore never really liked me much in the first place. It‚Äôs just such interesting and impulsive behavior from him. 

I didn‚Äôt reply to his text and will be moving on. What an interesting experience‚Ä¶.",1,1736872610.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Further, it was stated that someone's disc had a problem other than disc rot because it does not fit the above qualifications.  I have had compact discs go bad and wish to clear up the confusion.  The following is from Wikipedia:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc\_rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot)

Disc rot is the tendency of CD, DVD, or other optical discs to become unreadable because of chemical deterioration. The causes include oxidation of the reflective layer, reactions with contaminants, ultra-violet light damage, and de-bonding of the adhesive used to adhere the layers of the disc together....The reflective layer is typically aluminium, which reacts easily with several commonly encountered chemicals such as oxygen, sulfur, and certain ions carried by liquid water. In ordinary use, a surface layer of aluminium oxide is formed quickly when an aluminium surface is exposed to the atmosphere; it serves as passivation for the bulk aluminium with regard to many, but not all, contaminants...In the case of CD-R and CD-RW media, the materials used in the reflecting layer are more complex than a simple aluminium layer, but also can present problems if contaminated. The thin 0.25-0.5mm layer of protective lacquer is equivalent. 

On CDs, the rot becomes visually noticeable in two ways:

When the CD is held up to a strong light, light shines through several pin-prick-sized holes.

Discoloration of the disc, which looks like a coffee stain on the disc. See also CD bronzing.

In audio CDs, the rot leads to scrambled or skipped audio or even the inability to play the disc.",0,1736872569.0,Cd_collectors,15,0.29,False

Leaving the Stern Show was supposed to be my big break, a chance to carve my own path. Katelyn and I packed up our lives and headed south, aiming for the cum-soaked streets of St. Peter. We checked into the Tampa Bay Extended Stay Hotel on Ulmerton Road‚Äîa very classy place. It has cable TV with HBO. I told Katelyn it was temporary, just until Devil Horn Productions took off and we could buy a house in Tampa.

The drive down was uneventful until we stopped at a truck stop off I-95. There, we met Tre‚ÄôShawn‚Äîa tall, smooth-talking black guy with a confidence that made me uneasy. He struck up a conversation, mostly with Katelyn, and before I knew it, he was asking her if she'd play with his penis. Katelyn glanced at me, then back at him, and said she‚Äôd think about it.  

Later, at the motel, Katelyn disappeared for a couple of hours. I figured she went to find drugs or maybe check out the local scene. When she returned, she was flushed and smiling, talking about how she ran into Tre‚ÄôShawn again and they had coffee. Katelyn doesn't drink coffee but I didn‚Äôt press for details; after all, I trust her.  

St. Pete‚Äôs got its share of characters, Diary. Met a guy at a local bar who claimed he liked metal metal, but when I asked him about Cannibal Corpse's discography, he drew a blank. Poseurs, everywhere. Makes me appreciate my own authenticity, you know?  

Thinking back to my swinging days with Amanda, it‚Äôs funny how life comes full circle. Katelyn seems to have a knack for finding handsome African-American gentlemen at parties, diving into the fun while I hang back, observing, and eating candy. It‚Äôs thrilling, watching her enjoy herself.  

Anyway, Diary, here‚Äôs to new beginnings in St. Pete. The sun‚Äôs hot, the people are interesting, and who knows? Maybe Devil Horn Productions will find its footing here. Until then, I‚Äôll keep writing, keep dreaming, and keep living life on my own terms.ü§òüèΩü§òüèΩü§òüèΩ

I didn't find out had CPTSD until the end.,"Let me start off by saying we only dated for 1.5 months. I was her first bf in 4 years. She has adhd but is medicated. She told me this was because she just can't find a good guy and typically gives up on things at the first sign of trouble. I knew she was in zero contact with her parents and always had a bad relationship with her father. The first time this was talked about I didn't pry. She just simply stated she isn't in contact with them. I could tell she didn't want to talk about it. One other occasion I mentioned how I'm in therapy. She said she needs to be in it too but has never gone. As we got deeper with each other I brought it up and asked why she isnt in contact with her parents. She reiterated the same thing as before. I said "" I understand what thats like. I had to cut off my father for some time but we are good again. We have to do this for our own mental health. Im hear if you ever want to vent or talk about it"". It was not until the end during a bad argument that she brought up how she was possibly verbally abused or maybe even physically. Ill get to what happened with that. I just got prescribed adderall for narcolepsy and realize its messed with my mood and has made me irritable.

Everything was great between us. We started off moving fast. Lots of touching all the time and spending every weekend together(she lives 3 hours away). We didnt get to know each other much in the beginning and the relationship was led by chemistry, good sex and lots of laughter. I led the charge in forming a deeper connection. Asking her deep questions about her and life. Trying to form that emotional connection but I always felt like it was hard to get deep with her. She stayed on surface level topics. Lots of gossip about her friends and co workers and jokes. I thought it was because she hasnt had a relationship in so long. I also found out through her co worker she threw a coffee mug at someone one time when she had just told me it was a french fry. I thought okay maybe she just has anger issue but ill see. She also tend to drink a lot. 8 or so drinks a week but at least a glass of wine most nights and has been wasted 3 separate times while dating. I still didn't realize that she was hurting inside from childhood trauma from her father :(

She made it clear she wanted me. Telling me how excited she was to see me. Her face glowing everytime she saw me. Her eye contact. I met her friends. She was caring if I felt sick. So I really caught feelings. At one point she told me she liked me because I was her rock and stable. I felt like that for her.  I asked her about needs. When she would come to me about an insecurity I made her feel secure and would ask if she was good or needed anything. When I would ask a question about her and felt stupid asking it she would assure me she was happy to ask it and was so good about making me feel secure back. It was healthy.

Our first disagreement happened. I asked her if she was okay two separate times and she said yes then I did something and it set her off. In this disagreement she completely shutdown. I asked her whats wrong and if she wants to talk and she was just silent. I just sat there for 10 minutes not saying anything else. I then began to cry a bit out of frustration. During this disagreement she said something very hurtful to me so I was wondering why Im just being ignored now. Thats when she opened up and said sorry for what she said and it wasnt right. I could tell she was really sorry. I told her its okay but its important we communicate so we avoid this. I made it clear ill never get mad at her for communicating and she can always tell me whats wrong. I said this in a very calm and caring tone while touching her. She said she just needs to get use to all of this because its been so long since shes dated.

Everything was perfect after that. Fast forward to NYE/NYD. I woke up feeling extremely off. I was just prescribed adderall for narcolepsy and hadnt taken it for two days but didnt know thats what this was at the time. I felt so weird and emotional. NYE I asked her if she was okay and she said yea but was really cold. Much like how she was the first time. I asked again. She was just silent. I walked outside in a hurry to cool off my emotions. I came back and she was mad and said ""you stormed off like a fucking child"". That hurt. I told her I was just ignored again and she said she didnt hear me even though I asked her point blank. I just im just worried she isn't okay and I don't want what happened last time to happen again because it really hurt me.  After some back and fourth we agreed that when she says shes okay I wont ask anymore. I told her sorry for being needy this day has just been really weird for me emotionally. Rest of the night was great.

NYD was great until the night. We had sex. She finished. I didnt. Afterwards I asked if she wanted to go again and she said yea. we tried for 5 minutes and she just stopped without saying anything. I said want to keep going? She said we just tried. I said for ""5 minutes but if you are done its okay im not trying to pressure you."" She said ""you're trying to pressure me"" angrily. Turned off and got on her phone. I said ""would you like to talk?"" She didn't say anything. I got upset and said okay you're going to ignore me again. I was really upset and said you've been ignoring me recently with these conflicts. She said i pressured her. I stopped and calmed down and immediately profusely apologized. I do recognize how wrong I was in this situation and told her. She then explained she was hurt bc of how upset I got. She brought up her dad and said her mom let him get away with too much stuff and he was just really mean. I held her the rest of the night after this. I feel so bad for this. I assumed she was talking about verbal abuse. The next day she ended things saying our communication styles are different and we have a great connection but are incompatible. I apologized for everything again and said I understand but know her communication style now. I said I understand that you shutting down is a response to stress and its not because you are trying to purposely harm me. She said she liked the idea of working on things but thinks we still might be incompatible because of this.

After meeting with my doctor we decided the adderall worked great at first but was starting to make me emotionally unstable. Now that I've stopped it I feel stable and can handle her trauma responses much like I did the very first time she shutdown. I feel as though Im back to my old calm self and not the person that was starting to get emotionally unstable toward the end. Im not blaming her for anything. I just want to be the stable person she needs and wants. She's an amazing person at heart. Can I salvage this and should I send her a message explaining the medication situation?",1,1736871901.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I'm 7 weeks in and weight loss is going well though some of the loss was just dropping water weight after Thanksgiving bloating. That said, I've found that I'm not drinking as much liquids and I know I should be. Before I started the program I drank mostly black coffee and coke zero. I'm drinking less of those now, which is good, but I'm also just not very thirsty. I think some water of course but not as much as I should.  
Is anyone else finding themselves to just be less thirsty? I don't want to be dehydrated of course and I don't know if this is a common side effect or if I need to look at other factors unrelated to the injections.  
  
If anyone is interested, I am intermittent fasting and most days I'm one meal a day which I've found to be very comfortable with the help of the injections. I'm not tracking my food yet but I keep my portions reasonable compared to my prior habits & I try to make mostly good choices. I don't exercise more than dog walks multiple times a day due to long term joint damage from injuries, though I hope to be able to do more once I'm considerably lighter. I'm scared of stalling out due to lack of exercise, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.",0,1736871888.0,HimsWeightloss,3,0.5,False

Endo & colonoscopy clear except some very mild reflux esophagitis.

1i19qdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i19qdy/aitah_for_writing_up_my_employee/,AITAH for writing up my employee?,"I (31F) work for a local-ish business, and am the store manager. I've worked for this company for 7.5 years, and I've been the manager for 1.5 years. 

About three weeks ago, I wrote up one of my employees (22F, bookkeeper) for wearing jeans that went against the companys dresscode. She has worked at the company for almost six years, and knows the dress code. Her and I have even discussed the dress code in the past when I've written people up for the same thing and sent them home. I explained to her why she was getting written up, and she said that she understood, and we were good. Everything went smoothly. I asked if she had any questions or anything, and I sent her home. I truly didn't see the point in having her go home and change, because she KNOWS the dresscode. After I emailed the write up to HR, and filed it away, I went about my day. 

About 10min later, I got a phone call from my boss/the company owner. He asked if I had a minute to talk, so I went outside, as the bookkeeper was still in the office. He told me that she had called him sobbing and he was calling me to see what happened. I explained everything to him, and he didn't agree with the write up. He was also pissed that she hadn't finished the deposit or gone to the bank. Which was a lie. At this point, she had been at work for about 4hrs and was done with the deposit, but had yet to go to the bank. He told me to join her in the office and that he would be calling the two of us in 5-10min. 

When he called back, I had him on speaker, and he told me that he looked at the cameras and didn't see an issue with the large rips in her jeans, because ""that's how they're made"" and ""it's a fashion trend."" Some of the rips were several inches wide and on her upper thigh. But I guess as long as no one can see your ass, cooch, or your thong underwear, then it's fine? The company GM was also on the call. I was a bit unprofessional and amped up, and said something along the lines of ""Great, the princess who can apparently do no wrong gets what she wants, like always."" The bookkeeper was laughing and had the cockiest smerk on her face. She knew exactly what she was doing. I even called her out and said ""Why are you laughing? You know it's true."" My boss told her to go home and change, and to come back to work. She said ""yes, sir"" in her sweetest, most innocent voice, and gave me a look before leaving. 

I'd also like to add that about 30min before this, I had been on the phone with the GM and was getting his advice about this situation. When I've written up other long time employees, it created a shit storm of drama. This was the bookkeepers first write up since she's worked for the company. He agreed on sending her home and everything seemed fine. The last two managers have been men, and she always batted her eyelashes at them and acted like the sweetest person. A few months after I became the manager, she told me that things ""weren't the same"" as they were with the previous manager, and that she ""didn't feel respected or cared about"". It was strange to me, because I didn't feel like I was acting any differently towards here. We've never been close, and have gotten into little disagreements over the years, but we always worked them out. I asked her if she could give me some examples as to why she felt this way. She said that it was because her and the previous manager (mid 40sM, we'll call him Shane) would sit around and talk a lot, and he would bring her breakfast to work and sometimes coffee or an energy drink. Which is true - I witnessed a lot of that. When Shane was the manager, he would also flirt with her a lot and would tell me how attractive he thought she was, especially in her tight jeans. Now, I'm a queer wlw, but I'm not about to flirt with my employee and buy her things so she likes me. 

Anyway, once she was out of the office, my boss told me that my behavior was ""inappropriate"" and to void the bookkeepers write up. He then told me that he was going to write me up for my behavior, and that I'd get a form to esign. He went on some tangent about communication. I live by ""communication is key."" I did agree that I acted a bit unprofessional, which I apologized for, and told him that as managers, we're given the position and thrown to the wolves. We aren't necessarily trained until we do something wrong/incorrect, and we're not really given guidance on how to handle certain situations. My boss laughed at me and said that we ""shouldn't need to be trained on how to talk to people""... that wasn't what I said at all. Whenever I do try to get that guidance, it apparently backfires. I have been working hard in my time as manager to get rid of the drama causing/seeking, toxic af employees that I have had the displeasure of working with for several years. The week before, I had fired her boyfriend who had worked for the company for almost 4 years, and she had been an absolute bitch to everyone after that. After the phone call, I emailed HR and told them to disregard the write up, and told her what our boss had said. 

I still haven't received the write up, so I'm thinking that they either forgot or something else is in the works. I definitely won't be bring it up to them. 

I don't think that I'm the asshole in this situation,  and all of my other coworkers agree. Everyone now hates her and her attitude, and they have my back. I do feel like I've been treated unfairly by my boss and the GM. I've never had issues with the GM in the past and I've been able to confide in him, but now I've lost all trust and respect for the man. 

Her behavior also caught me off guard, after I fired her bf, because a few months ago, her and I had gotten really close, and we had gotten close with another employee, too. The bookkeeper had had a panic attack one day, due to issues with her ex, and we helped her through it. She confided in us and did so for quite some time.

For the past few months, I have been struggling with a dry mouth when I wake up. My tongue, gums and the insides of my cheeks feel horribly dry. As soon as I wake up and start producing saliva again, it starts to feel sticky and it tastes gross. I also noticed that I've been getting a lot of tonsil stones because of this.

I know this is probably caused by sleeping with an open mouth. I have an overbite as well as an open bite (it was corrected with braces and elastics when I was 13, but just came back completely a few years later). So my lips do not stay closed automatically. The only way to correct the overbite now is jaw surgery, but that is not an option in my case (multiple reasons). I've tried applying mouth gel before going to sleep, but that doesn't work. The strange thing is, why did it suddenly start happening a few months ago? Nothing changed in my medication or routine...  
  
Is there another way to keep my mouth shut while sleeping? I've seen Invisalign with little ""hooks"" that keep your lower jaw in front of your upper jaw but I'm not sure of that. I'm also hesitant about mouth taping because I've heard a lot of negative things about it as well.

I was hoping anyone else had experience with this, or had any other suggestions?

I applied Boiled Linseed Oil and let it cure for 10 days. I then used General Finishes Arm-R-Seal oil modified urethane with three coats on the bottom and four on top. Between each coat of urethane I waited 24 hours and my shop was held at around 63F. After the last coat I waited 10 days before bringing it in. I also used steel wool and paste wax to buff it and that cured on the last day. It has been 7 days since then, so I can conservatively say I had two weeks of curing before this mistake.

Last night I had a hot dish that I put on a half inch thick wool trivet. This morning I can clearly see the issue here. I had also noticed that a spot where I usually put my coffee cup has developed a similar issue.

My questions are: Is this finish always susceptible to heat issues or did I not let it cure enough? To fix with the same oil finish I imagine I have to strip the wax, sand, and re-apply it OR is it possible to do a spot repair? What could I do outside of sending this out to a professional shop to make this a more durable finish? And in the future should I invest in wood trivets instead of wool?
